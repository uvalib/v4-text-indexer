      <field name="fulltext">’BEL OF PRAIRIE EDEN. CHAPTER I. `They are strangely superstitious, these wild men of the prairie, who, with rifle in hand, and the deep starlight of the illimitable heavens above, wander in silence over the trackless yet blooming wilderness. Left to their own thoughts, they seem to see spectral forms, rising from the shadows, and hear voices from the other world, in every unusual sound. Among their superstitions there is one which has often struck me with its singular interest and beauty—' —MSS. of a Texan. `Come brother, it is a beautiful view—look yonder.' The boy advanced from the shadow of the oak and gazed upon the prairie, bathed in the light of the setting sun. He was but a boy, slender and girlish in form, and yet he grasped a rifle in his hand and carried a knife in his belt. His brother did not seem to heed him, but stood leaning against the trunk of the oak, his arms folded over his rifle, while his downcast eyes were fixed upon the sod. The sun in its last glow cast a warm light over his broad chest and muscular form, and invested with a golden flush, his fine aquiline features, shaded by a dark beard and flowing black hair. It was altogether a striking face; the eyes, somewhat sunken beneath the well-defined brows, were large, black, and strangely brilliant. He would have been observed and gazed at in any company, and even now, as he stood beside the oak, the boundless prairie around, and the Great God above, there was something noble in his look and bearing. It is true he wore a plaid grey frock, reaching to the knee and edged with fur, yet this unpretending garment displayed a broad chest, supported by a waist, at once slender and pliable, and revealed the iron outline of his sinewy arms. Its color, pale grey, gave a richer lustre to the sunset glow which bathed his face. On the sod before him lay his hat, a rude thing of grey felt, with skull-crown and wide slouching brim. It was decorated with a single black feather. `Come, brother John; look! is it not a beautiful view? Our men, the volunteers of Prairie Eden, encamped on the prairie; near this knoll, their horses grazing on the rich grass, as gathered in a circle, their rifles near them, they build the camp-fire and prepare for their evening meal. Look at the sky, John—not one cloud! Yes, one; a little cloud, hovering like a bird, in the west, just over the setting sun, and turning, blue, purple and gold, as the light grows brighter ere it fades. The prairie, John,—the grass moving like waves at sea, with all kinds of beautiful flowers, starting from the sod. Come,— don't stand muttering there; come I say.' And the slender boy laid his hand upon his brother's arm, and playfully sought to raise his head. The brother, still absorbed in his thoughts did not heed him. `Here we are, thirty miles from San Antonio. Shall we go forward?—shall we return home?' `Home!—pshaw! Did not we leave Prairie Eden this morning—we—' `We!' echoed the older brother, raising his eyes and surveying the girlish form before him. `Yes, we!—the Voluntears of Prairie Eden —composed of Mr. Jacob Grywin's two sons, forty white laborers—some civilized people from the States, others German emigrants— and ten black slaves; not to mention Ewen McGregor, who now comes up the knoll to speak with Captain John Grywin.' John raised his eyes, surveyed for a moment the smoke of the camp fire in the prairie, not one hundred yards from where he stood, and then his gaze rested upon the new comer. You will observe that the knoll on which the brothers stood was one of those delicious green islands which dot the rolling surface of the wild Texan prairie, and are seen by the wayfarer sometimes at the distance of thirty miles. It was crowned by a solitary tree, a greak oak, whose trunk three men could not have spanned with their extended arms.— Broad and wide above the brothers' head, stretched out the rugged branches, clad in a glorious drapery of silvery moss, which floated like a shining shroud, among the deep green leaves. `Captain John, while the boys take their supper, I've come up here to have a little talk with you.' It was a harsh, grating voice. The figure was that of a giant, so towering in stature, so massive in the bull-like chest, and formidable long arms, whose corded sinews were impressed upon the folds of the grey sleeves.— The face was like the form, huge and burly. A red visage, with white eyebrows and eyelashes, short stiff red hair and an immense red beard, matted like the mane of some wild animal. It was not the most prepossessing form in the world, nor the prettiest face, yet an air of bluff, hearty frankness, seemed to pervade each feature—even the mouth, with thick lips and the large eyes with yellowish balls—and govern the movement of every limb, as Ewen McGregor drew near the oak. `Well, Ewen, or rather, Lieutenant McGregor—' said John. `You see, when we left Prairie Eden this morning, bound for San Antonio, in obedience to a proclamation of the President of Texas, which summoned `all good citizens' to the western frontier, menaced as it is by a fresh Mexican invasion—when we left, I say, there was some things which we did know, and some things which we ought to know, but did not know, by —!' `Well Ewen?' said John, calmly surveying the bluff form hefore him, while Harry looked on with a sort of comical wonder dilating his clear blue eyes. `We are going to San Antonio,' resumed Ewen, resting his rifle on the sod. `For days there has been a rumor of the approach of the Mexican general who commands at Presidio del Rio Grande. How do we know that at this very moment this General, Don Bascus, is not in possession of San Antonio?' `If we dont know we can easily ascertain. A ride of thirty miles after dark will bring us to San Antonio before midnight.' This cool respone seemed to disconcert the bluff Ewen. `But, Capt. John, suppose the town should be occupied by some thousand Mexican devils—' `That would make us equal. Fifty white men of Texas are equivalent to one thousand Mexicans, any day. That computation is in some degree unfair, for it gives one Texan and his good rifle for twenty Mexicans. You see Ewen, General Bascus and his thousand men must not stand in the way of fifty volunteers from Prairie Eden.' `Not mentioning the ten niggers,' laughed Harry, as he mischievously pulled Red Ewen by the heard. `We'll fling the darkies in, and not make any charge for them.' Was it a flush of anger that crossed Ewen's face? He was silent for a moment, and then in a voice and with a manner which indicated a man of some education, he resumed— `Let us dismiss all jesting on the subject, John. General Bascus, whose approach is indicated by a rumor that grows more like truth every hour, has not merely a thousand men, but ten thousand incarnate devils with him. Suppose you go on to San Antonio to night and fall into his clutches? Just think of it, John—you and your brother, and all your laborors and slaves, dragged away to rot in a Mexican prison, while your father and Isabel await your return at Prairie Eden.' This picture touched John with great force. Harry's smile died away and tears filled his blue eyes. `O, John! Ewen speaks the truth! What would become of father and Isabel, in case we were taken prisoners?' `Yes, I see it now; I was wrong this morning to leave them so utterly unprotected at Prairie Eden. To be sure, our home is isolated; their is not much danger from the Indians, and as for the neighbors, the nearest is ten miles from Prairie Eden. But what would you propose?' `Remain encamped here to-night. It will be time enough for us to go on our way to-morrow morning. And in the meantime— but look to the East; do you see that knoll, distant some ten miles?' They followed the direction of his brawny hand, and saw the knoll, rising dim and vague among the mists, which began to whiten the eastern prairie. `I know Ben Davis, the scout, who has pitched his cabin there. If any one can give us any news of the Mexicans, he's the man to do it. By your leave, I will take my horse ride over there, and have a talk with him. I can be back long afore midnight.' `John's face manifested some thought. `It seems about the best course.' `Oh let him go—think of Father—Isabel!' cried Harry, sezing his brother by both his hands.' Ewen smiled at Harry's earnestness, and smiled until his thick lips parted, and his decayed, irregular teeth were visible. `Well, Ewen, you'd better go; and mind ye, let your return be as speedy as possible.' `Trust me for that!' And Red Ewen turned away, without a moments delay, and descended the knoll, bending his steps towards the encampment.— They saw his broad knife glistening in the sun, as he crushed the grass with his long, heavy strides. `Do you remember Ewen in Philadel— Harry began, as he surveyed the peaceful group of the encampment of rugged hunters encircling the fires which sent their volumes of pale blue smoke into the sky. `Hush!' and John's brow grew dark; his eye flashed with sudden intensity; `we never mention that name in the prairie.' `There he goes, the Giant with Red Head and Thick Lips! Look how he rides!' Wishing to drive his brother's thoughts from a painful topic, he stretched forth his small white hand and pointed towards Ewen, who was seen dashing towards the east, mounted on one of those fiery horses, peculiar to the prairie, with eyes like coals, and long, black, matted mane. John stood buried in thought. The twilight was gathering over the prairie, and in the broad west glowed the last flush of the departed sun. A fresh breeze arose and came tossing the grass like waves, as it gathered perfume from the innumerable flowers. Henry gazed with some awe in the face of his older brother, and saw his brow grow darker, his eye more wild and absent in its glance. `Its always the way with him when I mention that name,' he said and turned away to the western edge of the knoll. It was a very beautiful thing to see the last flush of the day imparting its soft golden warmth to that boyish face, whose white brow and clear blue eyes seemed animated with a deep, tranquil delight. The boy was gazing to the west, far, far over the boundless view, as the night seemed hovering above the prairie, pausing for a moment ere it came down to kiss its flowers and sleep upon its breast. Far in the north-west, the level line of the horizon was broken by an almost imperceptible elevation which shone like a golden point, from the shadows which sheltered around and beneath. Henry gazed upon that elevation, earnestly and long, until his breath came in gasps, his blue eye acquired a light, well-nigh as intense as his brother's. `That must be Prairie Eden,' he said, as sinking on the sod, he crossed his hands upon his knees, and thought, while the night came down, of home, of Father and Isabel. The night came slowly in its starlight drapery, and still the boy Harry sat in silence on the edge of the Prairie knoll, his slender form couched artlessly on the tall thick grass, while his eyes were raised to the heavens, and an indefinable emotion stole over his face. Believe me, it was a face to love, so much of woman in its every outline, and yet a firmness like that of tried manhood, manifested in the sudden flash of the blue eyes, the quick nervous compression of the warm lips. And the breeze tossed his soft brown hair, and floated it in glossy masses over his forehead, but could not hide the tears that came imperceptibly into his eyes, and made them shine the brighter in the deep starlight. `I know what they are now doing now at Prairie Eden. I can see the wide hall lighted up, and father sitting near the table with the Bible on his knee. Sister is near him, bending over his shoulder as he reads. Yes, yes; I can see her black ringlets touching his grey hair, and floating upon his fore head. It is a happy home, and—' His fancy dared not look upon the picture of the future, for a vision of war and battles rose up before him, and while his young blood danced with the raptures of a soldier's life, he seemed to hear a voice which said,—`And that home you will never reach again!' Long he sat there, absorbed in his own thoughts, while from the other side of the knool, the songs and merry voices of the encamped volunteers of Prairie Eden, broke unheeded on his ear. At last his waking thoughts melted in a dream, and sinking on the sod, with the rifle in his hand, he slept the sound sleep of boyhood—that sleep worth all the gold and power in the world, for angels watch over it, and fan the sleeper's cheek with their invisible wings. He unclosed his eyes at last, and started up half-dreaming and but half awake. The morn was rising over the prairie. Far in the east a globe of pale gold was seen on the verge of the horizon, gleaming a sad and solemn light, as it was about to launch away into the great ocean of the sky. As Harry started to his feet a dark object interposed between his sight and the moon. He passed his hand over his forehead, and with the peculiar nervous fear of one suddenly aroused from a sound slumber, uttered an ejaculation that broke with startling emphasis on the dead silence of the prairie. For all was dead and still. The camp fires had gone out, the song of the hunters died away. Not a voice nor sound—no vision but the great prairie stretching forth in the light of the rising morn, with that unknown object towering black and dark before him. `Who comes there?' He stood with the rifle in his grasp, his finger on the trigger. A voice answered him—could it be his brother's, so changed and hollow?—`Harry it is I!'. It scarcely rose above a whisper— `Hush!—not a word. Our horses are ready at the foot of the knoll—come!' Wondering whether he was awake or dreaming, he suffered that extended arm to lead him silently down the knoll. He saw his own horse and his brother's standing there, the saddles on the horses, the reins flung over their necks, and for the first time recognized his brother in the dusky figure. `Mount!' And his brother's face was turned to the moon; Harry saw with indefinable fear, that the features were changed, his eyes unnaturally vivid and glaring, the broad forehead marked with swollen veins. `Brother—' he faltered out as he placed his feet in the stirrups. `Not a word! Turn your horse towards Prairie Eden, and ride as though a thousand deaths were dogging at his heels. Do not spare the spur,—follow me!' John's horse plunged beneath the merciless iron, and dashed through the grass, as though possessed by a devil. Henry saw his brother's form, rising boldly in the moonlight, and urged his own horse forward at the top of his speed. `But, the volunteers, brother,' he cried, as he gasped for breath. `Ride, I say! That star in the north-west — you see it? Don't take your eyes from it. On, in the name of God! That star shines above Prairie Eden.' Away they dashed without a word, their horses maddened by the sharp steel points, bounding over the sod with an accelerating speed that seemed rather like the flight of a bird than the pace of an animal. Not a word passed between the brothers, for Harry, panting for breath and racked by the plunging gait of his horse, looked on the form of John wiih an unknown feeling, something between wonder and awe. Once or twice a word trembled on his lips —but still his brother, without turning his head, muttered between his teeth,— `Ride!—spur! It is thirty miles to Prairie Eden—we must reach it in two hours or we are accursed for ever!' There was something terrible in the sight! —these black horses, with snorting nostrils and starting eyeballs, plunging over the prairie, while their riders dug the spurs into their flanks until the blood spouted forth and mingled with the white foam. The moon shone over them as they dashed away, and flung their shadows far and black upon the waving grass. John never once turned his head, but kept his eye fixed on the star. Harry could not keep his gaze from his brother's changed and ghastly face,—it held him like a spell. At last—it was when the moon was high above the horizon, and an hour and a half had passed away—Harry's horse stumbled and fell, the blood pouring in torrents from his nostrils. Severely bruised and half-stunned, Harry struggled from beneath the flanks of his dying horse, and saw John reining his steed back on his haunches. `Your horse is dying—come! Give me your hand! Spring up before me—now then! Yonder is the Island knoll of Prairie Eden— only five miles distant.' Harry felt his brother's strong arm around his chest, and saw his eyes—almost touching his cheek—flash with the same unnatural fire —he felt that his brother was mad, and grew cold as ice, although the breath that fanned his cheek was like the air of a furnace. `Only four miles—do you see the knoll, Harry? The house among the trees— ah!' Down came the horse upon his knees—he made an effort to rise, trembling in every nerve—it was in vain, With that desperate effort he rolled upon the sod, the brothers half bruised beneath his quivering flanks. It was scarcely an instant before John had gained his feet and rescued his brother from his perilous situation. `Harry—are you hurt? Have you strength left to run those four miles? Take your rifle and come,' He clutched his brother in an iron grasp, add hurried him away, rather dragging him along than running by his side. `It may have been a dream,' he muttered; `but no, no!—I saw him! With my eyes— before me!' `Saw him?' Harry gasped, as all the blood in his body seemed rushing to his eyes. `Yes; I saw him—no vision—reality, my brother, horrible reality! My God! the moon fades, the day is breaking. We've at least four miles to go. Do not fall, Harry, do not faint—a firm heart, my boy, and God will bless us! You know I am not superstitious, but to-night, as I stood beside the oak, while you lay sleeping near me, I saw him, with his white beard and spectral eyes, and—he was dressed like an old hunter, Harry,—you have heard the old prairie hunters tell of him, —how he walks the prairie at dead of night, and starts suddenly upon you, from the earth, at your horse's side, or even from the sod, where you lay sleeping. He wakes you with an ice-cold hand—so the hunters tell the story. But you know they are superstitious. I believe in nothing of the kind—I—but to-night, I saw him at my side! Look, Harry, the sun is rising, and we're three miles from the Knoll!' Thus gasping these incoherent words, as he dragged his awe-stricken and fainting brother along, John kept his eyes upon the knoll and his face grew even yet more pale, his eyes more frenzied, as the first ray of the rising sun shot like a golden thread, across their path. `Saw whom? Speak, John! Your face frightens me—I believe I'm dying—' he sank on one knee. `Harry, my dear boy—my child!—Oh do not faint now! in a little while and we are there! You are strong, Harry, it is but fancy —come, I will carry you! But I saw him to night, and talked with him, The Old Man of the Prairie! that spectre of these horrible solitudes, who comes to the dwellers in the wilderness, and tells them of coming evil— nothing but evil. He told me—look, Harry, the sun is shining on the knoll!' Ere we record the full history of the event ful night—it was in the spring-time of 1842, that these incidents occurred,—let us, in order to understand the history in all its details, gaze on a scene which occurred some ten years before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. PRAIRIE EDEN. `A home in the wilderness for the wanderers and outcasts of civilization. —Texan MSS. A LONE Indian stood on the summit of the mound. It was in the centre of one of those prairies which, in their boundless view, their vast horizon, remind us of the ocean, only for waves of foam, we behold emerald grass, tossing with gentle undulations, their summits crested by the roses of the wild rising into view, like sea foam, tinted by the last glow of a setting sun. These prairies, like the ocean, have their islands—green mounds, that rise above the boundless level, blossoming on their banks, with flowers and vines; crowned on the summit with aged trees, that stand in circular groups, like the solemn mourners over the dead centuries. A lone Indian, leaning on his rifle, his muscular form, attired in a panther's hide, which left his sinewy arms and broad chest, bare to the light, stood on the summit of a green island, in the centre of that boundless prairie. His head was drooped, his dark eye, fixed by strange emotions, glared with an immoveable gaze over the glorious view. Around the prairie that rolled away, far into the distance, until it became lost in the hazy line of the horizon, above the blue sky of a summer's day, dimpled only by a group of snowy clouds, that seemed to undulate in mid-air, the clear azure gleaming distinctly through their feathery folds, even as a virgin's bosom looks more beautiful through a veil of lace; by his side, a massive oak, the broad green leaves almost touching the tuft on his shaven brow- Alone that Indian stood, his body turned to the west, while, with his face over his shoulder, he gazed long and sadly upon the eastern land. It was a sad gaze, eloquent as a smile upon the lips of a dying man, whose veins are racked by superhuman torture. The trees of the Island Grove were all around him. Giant oaks, not more than twenty in number, circled on a space some three hundred yards square. Their trunks were like the huge pillars of some temple, reared in the wilderness to God; massive as blocks of granite, and encrusted with the thick bark, that had been hardening for centuries. Three hundred years had written their dusky memories upon that rugged rind of the ancient oaken trees. White moss clothed their far-spreading branches, and graceful vine blossoms trembled among their leaves of luxuriant green. A hundred men might have encamped with ease beneath each grand old oak, and found shelter from the sun and rain, in the shadow, the silence, the fragrant air of the green island of the boundless prairie. The sod, smooth as a floor, and covered with dark green moss, was sprinkled with flowers, whose unnumbered shapes of graceful beauty and dyes of rainbow loveliness, neither pencil nor pen can ever paint. Upon the foliage quivered the drops of last night's shower. And in the centre of the island, a spring of clear, cold water bubbled into light, between two huge rocks, and without a visible outlet, kept murmuring and sparkling forever, always clear, cold and pure. The Indian gazed to the west, and the silent eloquence of his deep eye found vent in his rude Indian tongue. `My fathers dwelt here, when these giant trees were saplings, not higher than my rifle, Where are they now? Before this knoll itself was reared, as the grave of warriors, Red Men were upon this soil, the Kings, the Prophets of their people. Where are they now? The bones of the mighty men rest in the bosom of this knoll—but their children, where are they? Look for them far away by the great Salt Lake, in the land of the setting sun!' Once more the Indian turned his eye to the east, as though in the dim line of the horizon he already discerned the banners and bayonets of White civilization, and then turning sadly away, he sat him down by the waters of the island spring. `Water, that comes from the caverns where my fathers sleep, I drink from your fountain, once more, and drink for the last time, ere I depart forever!' Bathing his hands and brow in the pure element of the Island fountain, he went on his way toward the west and came back no more. Years passed on, and that prairie of the wilderness was left to solitude and God. In the tall grass the deer, with branching horns and mild eyes, moved over the flowers, the roses, the dahlias and the lilies of the desert, without a fear. Along the summit of the island came herds of wild cattle, drinking one by one at the pure spring—gazing for a moment at the boundless yiew, and then dashing away through the sea of undulating grass, like a cloud hurled by a thunder storm. Some times the wolf, gaunt and lean, and treacherous as a hypocrite, stole over the sod of the island grove, and the caguar, with its flashing eye and sleek fur, dipped his blood-streaked jaws, in the clear wave of the island fountain. But man came nevermore along the prairie. The Indian—search for him toward the west, in the land of the setting sun. The White Man—yonder, in the region of the rising sun he dwells, his footsteps have never pressed this virgin soil. Ten years passed, and a strange sight was seen one summer morning upon the summit of the island grove. A large mansion, reared in the space between those circling trees, and built of massive logs, disclosed its lofty hall door, its many windows, and its steep roof, varied by numerous chimnies, to the beams of the rising sun. The huge trees stretched forth their boughs above its roof, and the vines trailed in festoons about its windows. Its black timbers looked out from the graceful drapery of the white moss, hanging like a silvery shroud from branch to branch and from tree to tree. Altogether, this huge mansion looked like a baronial fabric of the Middle Ages, invested as it was with the tokens of a barbarous luxury, something between savage grandeur and refined civilization. It was two stories in height, with four spacious rooms on a floor. These rooms were divided on the first floor, by a spacious hall; on the second by a corridor. Instead of paint or plaster, the walls of log were concealed by hangings of various hues and devices, some of dark green Cordovan leather, edged with gold, some of the richest silk. The chairs, the tables, the fire places, and the stairway, were all on the same scale of antique grandeur, mingling luxury and rudeness in every detail. From the centre of their island grove, this spacious mansion rose, with the green sod all around it, the trees half closing it from the sun and rain, the cool fountain bubbling near it, some few paces to the west. Yonder, north of the grove, you behold fields of emerald corn, with small huts, built of logs, rising from the quivering leaves. On the prairie graze herds of sleek cattle, iheir dappled sides contrasting with the rich grass around, the quivering beds of wild flowers beneath. And at the morning time, a column of blue smoke rises over the tops of the trees, and glows, like the white breast of a bird turned to the rising sun. It is incense from the fireside of the Prairie Home. Who is it that dwells within the prairie home? A father and his three children. That father, a man of slender form, grey hairs, and sad aspect. He was known by the name of Jacob Grywin. The nearest neighbort—who lived only ten miles from the island grove—looked with wonder, mingled with some awe, upon the sad, stern man, who had so suddenly erected his home in the wilderness. He came—no one knew whither. In the year 1840, after the young Texas had struggled into Independence, through the bloody clouds of Soliad, the Alamo and San Jancentho, the emigrant first appeared on the prairie, and with his family of three children, his retainers—some fifty in number, and mostly from the `States'—some dozen German colonisis, and as many slaves, reared the mansion, known by the appropriate name—Prairie Eden. Two years had passed, and the unknown emigrant, living in a kind of barbarous splendour, beheld his children rising round him, like fruit and flowers, nursed into vigorous bloom by the air of the wilderness. His sons presented a strong contrast. John, aged twenty-one, was a man of stalwart, yet graceful propoetions, with a dark brown visage, strongly marked with aquiline features, and shadowed by dark hair and beard. He was a magnificent horseman and a fearless hunter. As he mounted his dark bay horse, with his riffe, `Old King Death,' as he quaintly called it, slung over his shoulder, his long hair floating in the wind, and his eagle-like features, marked boldly out against the sky, he looked for all the world, like a true knight of the chivalric age. Harry, his brother, a mere boy of sixteen, with girlish form, and beardless face, along whose smooth outline flowed his curling brown hair, compared with John, reminded you of the quivering sapling beside the hardy oak.— And yet there was a volume of daring in the glance of his dark blue eye. John loved him, as though he was at once father, brother and friend to girlish Harry,—even as David loved Jonathan, with a love passing the love of women. The third child, three years younger than John, and of course, one year older than Harry. I see her now, standing upon the porch of the mansion, her dark hair, plainly turned aside, from the warm beauty of her face, while her round arms, full bust, and passionate eyes, attest an impetuous, nay a voluptuous woman. She was indeed one of the women, whom we call `queenly,' especially in case our knowledge of queens is limited. Her stature was commanding. Her complexion, a clear, deep olive, burning with red bloom on each cheek. Her lips, full and warm, and tinted with dewy vermillion. Her forehead, white and high, with the jet-black hair, shadowing its outlines. These words may give you some idea of 'Bel Grywin, but no words can describe how suddenly her face changed its expression, now glooming like a thunder storm, the eyes armed with lightning and the brow gathering blackness; and in a moment, soft and yielding and tender, as the face of a slumbering child. When the eye of the father rested upon the faces of his children, the cloud passed from his brow. But when he was alone, either striding along the porch of his mansion, in gazing silently over the great prairie, or passing, with cat-like step, from room to room, there was a gloom upon his features, which, to say the least, was not pleasant to behold. That sidelong glance toward the window, or the door, that involuntary start at the sound of a footstep, what did they mean? What need Jacob Grywin fear? Centered in the midst of this prairie, afar from civilization, and yet surrounded by all its comforts— nay, its luxuries; his children blooming round him, and his slaves and laborers ready to do his will, what had he to fear? There came a day in the spring of 1842, when the Proclamation of the Texan President summoned all good citizens to the western frontier, in order to defend the soil of the young state from a threatened invasion.— Mexico was, of course, known to be the invader, and the impulse of the invasion, Santa Anna. Vague rumors floated over the prairie, telling of outrages on the frontier, and it soon became a settled opinion that Santa Anna, like the Bourbons, could neither forget nor learn. It became evident that the horrid butcheries of past years were again to be enacted on Texan soil. That Santa Anna, who had been dragged from a swamp, clad in the garb of one of his lacquey's, after the battle of San Jacinto—presenting a rather contemptible image of despair, had not forgiven the Texans for sparing his life. In a certain view of the matter he was right, for if even a murderer forfeited his life, by a series of cold-blooded butcheries, that murderer was Don Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna. Among other rumors it was announced that Don General Something, from the Oresidio del Rio Grande, was approaching the western frontier, in formidable force, his object, the possession and plunder of San Antonio, near which still arose the blackened walls of the Alama. These rumors reached the solitude of Prairie Eden. One morning,—it was when the spring of 1842 was melting into summer.— John had a mysterious and energetic conversation with his father; and ere an hour had passed, the entire population of Prairie Eden, numbering nearly seventy men of all colors and nations, had taken horse and rifle, and ridden away in the direction of San Antonio De Bexar. Mr. Jacob Grywin and his daughter 'Bel, alone remained on the Island knoll. At the head of the Volunteers of Prairie Eden rode the brothers, John and Harry. By their side, the overseeer of the plantation,— Red Ewen McGregor, a man of gigantic frame and rude aspect, who seemed connected with the old man by some mysterious and indefinable tie. It was John's object to advance to San Antonio, with all his disposable force, join his men with other bands of volunteers, and make a Texan resistance to the approaching Mexican army. He did not contemplate an absence of more than one week from Prairie Eden. The isolated position of his father's mansion—so they all said—was it's surest defence against any predatory attack. Let us now return to this night in the spring or early summer of 1842.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. THE CHAMBER OF 'BEL OF PRAIRIE EDEN. `A hideous alternative,—your honor or his life. —Texan MSS. It was deep night, and the stars shone with their calm, sad light over the mansion and the grove of Prairie Eden. In the mansion all was still as death. The old man slumbered in his chamber on the ground floor; his daughter slept in her room on the second floor. All the other chambers were tenantless, and a silence like the tomb brooded over the corridors of that prairie home. The wind sighed mournfully through the tops of the trees, as their mossy branches swept the roof. The sound of the island fountain, making low music, as it bubbled from its cavern source, was heard in every pausa of the breeze. Yet within the mansion—tenanted only by the old man and his child—all was darkness and silence. The Chamber of Isabel! A large room, lighted by a lamp that stands upon a table near the bed, and sheds a feeble and flickering ray. It is shadowy here, in this bower of virgin repose, and yet you may discern the luxurious details of the place.— Soft matting on the floor, whose down-like texture would not return too rudely, the pressure of an infant's naked foot. Curtains of pale crimson silk, hanging from the ceiling, nd imparting a warm roseate glow io the face of the sleeper. Yonder an image of the Divine Virgin, a marble shape, elevated on its snowy pedestal, and over the mantel a picture of a wild-wood scene in far-distant Pennsylvania. The bed, with curtains, and coverlet, and pillows, all like a snow bank freshly fallen from the sky, so pure, so white, so spotless.— The curtain is slightly parted; through the interval gleams the vision of that face, framed in the darkly flowing hair, and pillowed on right arm, that bosom, which now is lost to view, and now quivers into light, above the tremulous lace of the night robe. A beautiful woman slumbering; with her lips, so ripe in their red bloom, gently parted, until they disclose the white teeth; the eyes closed, with the long black fringes resting on the cheek— It is a sight for angels to behold and love. She tosses in her slumber—you see a full round arm, with its small hand, all beautiful as an arm and hand of alabaster, tinted by the daybreak flush extened from the curtains. You hear a whispered word. Then the sleeper sinks again into repose like death, and a single black tress, curves over her neck and nestles on her bosom. At this moment a faint, creaking sound is heard, and all is still again. The door slowly opens, and a face, leering with a hideous smile, appears in the dusky interval. A cautious, cat-like footstep, and a form advances to the maiden's bed, and the light of the taper reveals a strange picture. That face, with short stiff hair and shaggy beard, alike scarlet red in hue, the bleared eyes and the thick lips, laughing the same brutal scorn upon the sleeping woman, that almost giant form, clad in the costume of a Mexican Ranchero, wide pantaloons, ornamented with glittering buttons, green jacket, tawdry with gilt trappings and a stout leather belt, girdling two pistols and a long and quivering knife. Who is this ruffian that dares intrude upon the sanctity of a maiden's bed chamber? He sweeps aside the curtains, bends his head, his breath pollutes the cheeks of the slumbering Isabel. You see his thick lips parting in a brutal grin, his huge arms extended, his colorless eyeballs—so white, and bleared, and glossy— fire with a gloating intensity. The white breast, the round neck, the warm countenance of Isabel lay open to that gaze of pollution. He turns to the door—listens. All is still! The hand of the ruffin plays upon the hilt of his knife, but it is for a moment only. Extending his brawny arms, he grasps her form and tears her, half-naked, from her virgin bed. In a moment the room is vacant. The outlines of that pure woman's form is still traced upon the pillow, the lamp yet burns on the table, but the room is silent and tenantless. But did you see that unconscious form, bound in the ruffian's arms; did you—even as he left the room—see that face, turned over his shoulder. The long, black hair showering down his back, as the eyes unclosed with a frightened glance? There is a gasping, half-suppressed cry in the corridor without—a hurried footstep and all is still again. When Isabel, thus rudely torn from her bed, unclosed her eyes, she beheld the dark green hangings of the eastern room on the ground floor. Pinioned in the ruffian's arm, she gazed around with the frightened glance of one suddenly aroused from a dreamless slumber, and beheld that wide room crowded by the forms of armed men, attired in the half-bandit, half-soldier costume of Mexican rancheroes. A solitary ruffian stood alone in the centre of the group, his slender form and bearded face, revealed by the light of the blazing pine knot, which he raised above his head with his right hand. That light flashed strongly over the green jackets and tinsel trappings of the soldiers, and played upon the blade of every long and quivering knife. For a moment the maiden trembled with fright as she beheld that swarty face, scowling all around her, but that moment passed, the warm blood coursed over her face and bosom; with a sudden movement she flung herself from the ruffian's arms and confronted the assassin band. `Why this outrage?' she cried, dashing the clustering hair aside from her face, and fixing the glance of an indignant eye upon the foremost of the group. She looked very beautiful, that half-clad woman, whose clasped arms were dressed upon her tumultuous bosom, with her unbound hair streaming over her white shoulders. There was dead stillness, and then a deep groan from the dark recesses of the room. The bandits parted, and in the interval made by their movement to either side, appeared an old man, whose slender form was clad in plain black, while his strongly marked features were rendered ghastly by a livid paleness. `My father! You here, bound too, and in these ruffians arms?' The old man, Jacob Grywin, replied by wringing his pinioned arms and uttering a low, deep moan. `My sons! my sons! why did I suffer them to depart for San Antonio? My men, too— all are gone, and here I am. Would to God I had only faithful Ewen here!' He spoke of the overseer of his plantation, that brave hardy fellow, who had left for San Antonio in company with his sons. A hoarse laugh echoed round the chamber —at once Jocob looked up, and Isabel turned as though a viper had bit her heel. `Your `faithful Ewen is here!' said the voice of the ruffian, who had torn Isabel from her bed. There he stood, dressed like the rancheroes, his stiff red hair and matted red beard imparting new hideousness to his bleared eyes and grinning lips. The old man was speechless. You see Isabella survey the ruffian from head to foot, while her face changes color, now red as day-break, now white as a shroud. `Aye, it's me:—Ewen McGregor, Red Ewen, or whatever the boys choose to call me! I am here! This band of trusty spirits are mine. I have come here at dead of night to secure this traitor to the Republic of Mexico.—We had hard riding to reach the place in time—a great many weary miles since nine o'clock. Somewhat in a hurry, you know; for to-morrow morning your sons will be home —bye-the-by, I left John and Harry at sunset. They were quite well.' He drew his knife and playfully felt its sharp edge. `My God! can this be real? moaned the old man. `I tell you it can be, and it is.' `But you were my friend—my overseer— you followed my fortunes into the wilderness —Ewen a traitor! No, no! I will not believe it.' The ruffian advanced, confronted the old man and glowered upon him with his blood-shot eyes,— `You talk of traitor—you. The broken bank director of Philadelphia, who turned traitor to the trust of some thousand widows and orphans, and then fled the city, seeking refuge for his guilty wealth in the prairie of Texas, sixty miles from San Antonio. Oh, Jacob! Pshaw, man! I know you. You forget that I was your clerk.' It was a hard blow; the old man felt it to the heart. As for Isabel, she stood like a thing of marble, frightfully pale, her clasped hands pressed nervously against her bared bosom. `You here too, my pretty one!' the ruffian sneered, as he turned upon her. `In my power! You were once the aristocratic lady of the aristocratic mansion, in Philadelphia. Now—' A movement was observable among the soldiers and a form advanced into the glare of the pine torch. It was a young man slenderly made, with an olive cheek and long flowing curls of jet black hair. His beard and moustache, all curling and as soft as silk, imparted a chivalric appearance to his delicately cut features. His eyes were very large and bright, and withal intensely black. Their expression was peculiar, indefinable. A close-fitting uniform of dark green, relieved by a single row of gold buttons, displayed the elegant proportions of his form. `Isabel,' he whispered, `we did not anticipate this moment when last we met.' He bowed low before the half-clad maiden, and looked on her with upraised eyes. `Don Antonio!' was all that trembled from the lips of the wondering girl. It was a strange group. The central figures —that handsome soldier with the olive cheek and smooth silken beard; the beautiful girl, whose flowing hair but faintly concealed the fluttering of her bosom; the light held over-head by the brigand soldier, the livid face of the father, and the brutal sneer of Ewen, distinctly revealed by its glare—the encircling rancheroes and the dark background of the curtained walls. A strange group, now shown in red light, again darkened by the shadows as they went and came. Don Antonio drew near the maiden, extending an elegent cloak of rich purple velvet, edged with golden fringe. Gently he flung it over her shoulders, and as her bosom was veiled beneath its solds, he whispered,— `Isabel! for the sake of the Holy Trinity, let me see you alone—alone, for one moment only.' He spoke in English, somewhat fluently, though with a decided Spanish accent. There seemed a more eloquent language; so thought Isabel, in his large lustrous eyes. `Come!' she whispered and led the way from the room. `You must be in a hurry, I tell ye,' they heard the coarse tones of Red Ewen, `for we have got a heap of justice to do, and little time to do it in.' Up the stairway she led him, and scarce knowing whither she went, entered the bed-chamber from which she had been torn only a moment past. There, by the light of the taper, which stood upon the table, near the bed, there, in silence and gloom of that virgin retreat, they confronted each other. Isabel, very pale, with her white arms, appearing from the folds of the purple cloak, her naked feet touching the soft matting on the floor; Don Antonio, with his brow uncovered his head drooped, his upturned eyes, resting on the half-shrouded form before him. `Speak,' she gasped; `this outrage—' The words died on her tongue. In a voice tremulous with delicate modulations, Don Antonio spoke, still maintaining that resyectful bearing. `You are in danger, Isabel! Last Thursday, at our nearest military post, sixty miles away, this ruffian Ewen appeared, denounced your father to the colonel of our regiment, stated the unprotected situation of Prairie Eden, and offered to lead a picked squadron to the place.' `Ah! I remember he was absent two days last week. But what charge could the traitor prefer against my father?' You know, Isabel, that our Government have decreed a new invasion of the rebellious Province of Texas. Our armies, even now, are encamped on its southern border. Ewen stated that your father's house was often used as a rendezvous for the rebel Texans. Nay, that his sons, his laborers, his very slaves, within a few days depart to join the army of some Texan General at San Antonio. I fear me it will go very hard with your father.— This Ewen is as cruel, as brutal, as traitors always are.' `But you can save us! You whom we knew in our prosperous days.' A meaning smile crossed the face of the Mexican. `I am only a subordinate officer. Red Ewen met us after sunset, at a designated point, and took command of this squadron of horse.' `And my father?' `May be put to death within an hour. Red Ewen seems to have some secret purpose of revenge.' Isabel sank to the floor; not prostrate, but kneeling with her white arms upraised, her eyes streaming tears! `My God! it seems like a hideous dream.' The Mexican raised his hand to his eyes— was it to hide a tear? `But you can save us, Don Antonio!' And with a bound she passed the distance between them, and knelt at his feet. You will save us! I see how it is—you only accompanied this expedition to do us service. O remember how my father's home in Philadelphia was once your home; remember—' `How the peerless Isabel scorned the suit of Don Antonio Marin, the attache of the Mexican legation, at Washington. Is it so, Miss Grywin?' Was that a sneer upon his dark-red lip?— What meant that sudden lighting up of his large eyes? Isabel trembled, shuddered as she beheld the sudden change of the Mexican's face. In an instant that expression was gone; he was composed and respectful again. `O, you would not be so ungenerous as to revive that memory now! I was but young— vain, frivolous then. I refused your suit it is true; my father to that refusal added some words, at once needless and bitter; but now, we are in danger; you will save us!' `Rise, lady! On one condition I will peril my life to save you.' He raised her gently from the floor. She stood there, erect as a queen upon her throne. Around her neck waved her glossy black hair. You could see her young bosom pant and writhe beneath the velvet cloak. `One condition!' she murmured; and waited for him to speak. He spoke it with his eyes. With his parting lips. With that sudden gaze which devoured every outline, every tint of her voluptuous form, from the head framed in the black hair, to the feet as white as marble. She shrank back as though a bullet had pierced her brain. `No! No! No! You cannot be so base as to think it!' `Isabel—' the whisper, husky with passion, fell on her ear like a torrent of boiling lead. `The case is plain. I love you—have loved you for years. Be mine, and I will sacrifice my rank, my honor, to serve you!' `Be mine!'—she echoed his words, and looked at him with a dumb, wandering stare. He beckoned her to the window. `Look yonder!' She looked, but would not believe her eyes. There rolled the prairie, silvered by the rising moon, but she saw it not, nor dwelt on the solemn beauty of that boundless sky. But a pine torch flung its ruddy glow over the sward in front of the mansion. That light revealed the bandit soldiers, the form of Red Ewen in their midst. There, with his neck bared, his brow uncovered, his face livid as death, stood her father. There was a rope about his neck, and that rope swung loosely, as it was tied to the oaken branch above his head. Isabel beheld that hideous picture, and sunk like a crushed flower, on the floor. All sense, all consciousness were gone. Her white arms, relieved by the purple cloak, dropped by her side, a glimpse of her pulseless bosom gleamed over the golden edge of the garment. She lay like a dead woman, her face like marble, her eyes wide open and glassy. Don Antonio bore her to the bed, and stamped his foot thrice upon the floor. A burly ranchero appeared in the shadows of the doorway; it was Red Ewen, in his hunter's garb. `Wine, slave! Search the cellars of the old heretic, and bring me a goblet of his rich old wine!' This, it must be confessed, did not look very much like respecting Red Ewen as the superior officer. A few brief moments passed—the lady still lay swooning—and Ewen, the newly-fledged rachero appeared with a massy golden cup in his hand, its glittering flowers contrasting with the purple gleam of the liquid trembling against the brim. `Begone! And mark ye, Don Ewen, commander of the squadron of Mexican horse! do as I have commanded you. Begone!” The ranchero was gone. Don Antonio was alone with the unconscious woman. What means that scowl glooming over his handsome face? What means that hand lifted over the goblet—that white powder, pouring from the paper in his fingers down into the red current of the wine? He gazed upon her, his black eyes dilating until they assumed a tiger-like glare. So helpless she lay beside him, unconscious, upon her virgin bed, with her dark hair wound about her round white throat; so like an image of purity, carved out of Parian marble, with her glassy eyes turned towards heaven! Ah, that was a coward act, Don Antonio! To sweep the cloak aside and gaze with gloating eyes upon the shrine of purity—her white and pulseless bosom. Ah, that was a traitor's kiss; that kiss from your burning lips pressed upon her lips as cold as clay. `Awake! Isabel, my love! I will save your father!' His arm is around her waist—he presses his bearded cheek against her cheek of velvet softness, and his lips, pressed with passion, quiver against hers. Dreamily she unclosed her eyes, and all unconscious as she was, drank from the goblet which he held to her lips. Then her countenance glowed, a blush like living flame overspread her face, her eyes seemed no fire with liquid light. `Where am I?' she gasped. `Ah, these forms that glide to and fro in the dance, these fountains that murmur drowsily in mine ears, these gardens, where a thousand lights break from the shadowy trees over groves of flowers.' `Her mind wanders!' and Don Antonio smiled until his white teeth shone like ivory under his black moustache. The maiden rose, spread forth her arms. like one struggling with a fatal sleep. The cloak fell, and that form, which combined all that is beautiful in the physical and intellectual organization of woman, glowed in the light, form its trembling veil. The drugged potion was in her veins—you can see it in the voluptuous dimness of her eyes, in the deeper red of her lips. Even in this moment her soul shone out, from the clouds which had begun to darken it. `Ah! where am I? Don Antonio, is it you? My father—oh, save him!' such were her incoherent words. Don Antonio started to his feet, and at once there gleamed from his eyes a strange light —there broke over his lips a stranger smile. `Listen, Isabel,—but two minutes of consciousness, of volition are yours! In those brief minutes I will lay your fate before you —aye, and you shall read it. Two years ago, in the city of Washington, you scorned my suit. Scorned! Your father heaped insult upon your scorn. My time has come!— Unless you become mine—mine at this hour, mine without priest or vow, I swear to leave your father to his fate—' `Mercy!' `That fate, death by the rope, at the hands of the ruffian, Red Ewen! Your brothers will return by morning light, but it will be too late —we will then be far on our way; but your father will swing on that tree, before the door of his home!' `You cannot be human! Not one drop of pity, not one—' `Reflect! I do not force your wishes.— You may swoon, but unless you say `yes' to my proposal, your father shall hang, and you will not feel my kiss upon your lips! Say `yes,' and I will save him. I that love you with a love that is merciless in its every pulsation. I that adore you so much that I will wreck every moment of your existence unless you consent to become mine!' He shook his small white hands above his head in the impulse of the fiery thought which corded every muscle of his face, and gleamed like an undying vengeance from his eyes. `One moment only remains! Think—I will not speak to you until that moment and consciousness are gone!' He turned away into the darker corner of the room. Standing near the bed, her form erect, her black hair tossing on her brow, she felt that the drugged potion was working in her veins, and that the next minute would fire her heart with the mad dream of voluptuous passion. Her mind was very clear—like a lake en shrined in the hollow of a mountain top, its glassy surface unruffled by a breeze But the next moment! Slowly, she glided to the window. Again that sight.—the livid face, the dangling rope. With a creeping shudder she turned away, and turned her eyes upon the tempter. In the dim corner he stood, his finger pressed against his lip, his dark eyes blazing upon her even through the gloom! Pity her now, all good angels! She felt the blood rushing to her brain; she heard gentle voices singing songs, as in the air; she saw soft masses of light playing over the uncovered forms of dancing women. Like a sleep that dream, born of opium, possessed her nerves, her brain, her soul! `Yes!' It is morning, and a faint ray of light trembles through the darkness of the corridor. Let us await, in this silence and gloom, with our eyes fixed upon the massive panels of yonder door. That door leads into the bed-chamber of Isabel. Forth from that door, as the rising sun streams through the window, glides a wild figure, with unbound hair, and livid blue circles under each glassy eye. The bosom is bare, and maked the feet,—you see the air play with the scanty robe,—but the feet are cold, the bosom white, pulseless, like the frozen breast of a dead woman. Is it a ghost? Can it be the warm and blooming Isabel, who last night said the evening prayer with her father, and went singing to her wirgin bed? Along the corridor she glides, one word quivering from her lips—`Father!' No reply,—the mansion is deathly still. Down the stairs, and out upon the porch. The rolling prairie, with the sun rising over its waves of grass and flowers—the blue sky and the grouping clouds, who hang above the path of day, catching his freshest kiss upon their bosoms. She saw it all—felt on her cold cheek the fresh breath of morning. But the soldiers! where are they? Ewen—Don Antonio— where? They are gone, all gone. She is left alone with her father. How can she meet his gaze! She, the—but pity her good angels, and weep fiends, as you behold your darkest work! `Father!' she cried, and listened. Noreply. She turned from the sunrise, and shuddered as she anticipated the withering gaze of that parent, whose life she had bought with her—soul. She turned, and saw her father. He did not frown upon his child, nor smile. There was a cold, calm look upon his face, and his eyes were steadily turned to the rising sun. But those eyes were glassy, that face was discolored, for the father dangled in the air, as the rope was about his neck, and the tree-branch quivered with his weight. Two forms were seen towards the East.— She saw them, as they came rapidly on, and greeted them with a shout of horrible laughter. `Welcome, John—Harry, welcome home.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. THE RANCHO SALADO. `There came an order from Santa Anna, stating that as these Texans, who had honorably capitulated at Mier, were pirates and robbers, every tenth man of them should—' —Texan MSS. It was a dreary rancho of dark stone, one story in height, with a stunted and withered tree before its low and narrow door. To the east extended a wall of stone, of the same hue as that which formed the rancho, only that a few miserable shrubs struggled into light between the solid blocks. Around that rancho all was one monotonous waste of sand, as far as the eye could see, and far in the east and west rose a range of barren hills, their rugged peaks rushing into the sunset sky. A view more desolate cannot be imagined. The rancho, with its wall, encircling a space some hundred feet square, was the only object that met the eye in all that waste of dreary sand and barren cliffs. A single black cloud, with rugged edges, spread over the tops of the western hills, and veiled, as in a pall, the lust beams of the dying sun. The air was hot, stifling, like the atmosphere of a furnace. It was the close of a long and sultry day. A flock of vultures were perched upon the flat roof of the rancho, folding their sluggish wings, as they seemed to scent the smell of human blood. Before the door waited a half-robber form, dressed in the tawdry green jacket and wide trowsers of a Mexican ranchero. There were pistols in his belt, as leaning on his rusty mus ket, he cast his sleepy eyes to the setting sun. This lonely farm house, or military post, call it what you will, was situated in the heart of Mexico, some hundred and fifty miles south of the city of Saltillo. It was called the Rancho Salado. Within the court yard, hidden by the impenetrable wall, a scene of peculiar interest was in progress. One hundred and seventy men, chained in couples, their faces worn by famine, and rendered more hideous by the uncombed hair and unshaven beard, were grouped in a circle. Their shrunken forms, wasted by long days and nights of thirst, hunger and cold, were miserably clad in rags that fluttered to every breeze. In the centre of that circle was a massive log, and on that log an earthen vessel resembling an antique funeral urn. Around these gaunt and famine-stricken forms was grouped a solid mass of Mexican steel. At least three hundred soldiers attired in green, gazed on the chained men, and raised thelr musquets in the light of the setting sun. Near yonder post, the colonel of the detachment, a man of some thirty-five years, with a dark olive face, rests his arms against the wall and turns his face away from the group of prisoners. This colonel has seen much bloodshed, and washed his blade on many a Texan field, but now the tears stream freely down his battle-worn cheeks. His officers, young men and aged, clad in the gay Mexican array, gaze on the group with wet eyes and quivering lips. Only one man,—you see him slightly advanced from the others—gazes upon the miserable men, with an aspect cold, stony and unpitying as Death. He is by no means an unhandsome man, for his beard is dark and silken, his hair glossy as a raven's pinion, his eyes full and lustrous. He gazes apon the prisoners and the urn and smiles, until his teeth glare out from beneath his moustache. Have we seen this man before? The colonel advances; as if choking down his emotions, he surveys the group and speaks. The Priest by his side, with dark brown and rotund face, translates his words into English. Texans! Taken prisoners in an attack made by you, last Christmas day, on the town of Mier, situated in the Republic of Mexico, you were brought, some months since, to this rancho, on your way to the city of Mexico. You rose on the guard, shot and stabbed our sentinels, and escaped. After days and nights of starvation and misery, worse than death, you were re-taken, and again you stand upon the scene of your mad adventures. Texans! By the order of Don Antonio Lopez de Santa Anua, President of the Republic, you are declared pirates and robbers, out of the pale of all international law, and stripped of all the rights of civilized communities. You are worthy of death, in the most sudden and ignominious form, but, in mercy'—there was a convulsive movement in the brave Colonel's throat, which well-nigh choked his voice—`in mercy, I say, the President decrees that only one out of every ten men shall be put to death.' He paused,and as though embarrassed by his emotions, played for a moment with the hilt of his sword. You see, his officers stand weeping near yonder wall, and still, with his uncovered brow, glowing in the light of the setting sun, stands that solitary and unpitying cavalier, with the dark hair and silken beard, `Within that urn are deposited one hundred and seventy beans; seventeen black ones, among one hundred and fifty-three white ones. You will advance two by two, and draw each of you, from the urn a single bean. If it is white, you live,—black and you die before sunset.' He turned away, and the Texans looked silently in each other's faces. The unpitying officer—did we ever see him before?—advanced, passed through the prisoners, and took his seat on the log. The priest handed him a large blank book, with pen and ink. This man was to enter the names of the living and the dead,as one by one, they raised the death-urn. The air seemed to grow more sultry, and a strange silence descended upon the scene. While the Colonel and his officers were moved to tears—while even the rough soldiers wept, as they grasped their muskets— while that solitary, unpitying man, seated by the urn, looked coolly in the faces of the Texans, they advanced two by two and chained as they were, inserted every man his hand in the urn of death. The first couple—a man with sinewy form and hair like snow, and a man whose robust figure indicated the wreck of Herculean strength. At once they inserted their hands: there was a pause. Sobs were heard from the group of Mexican officers. The Register of the Dead—so let us c ll the handsome officer, who, seated on the log, holds the book of life and death—coolly watched their movements, as though he had wagered a few dollars on the result. The old man drew a black bean. `Death!' cried the Register, as he entered his name on the book. The old man, whose features, covered with a snow-white beard, belied not one trace of emotion, whispered to his comrade— `Should you ever return to Texas,—I have a daughter,—you will bear to her my blessing?' The Herculean Texan could not reply. The manacles were loosened, and the aged man calmly stepped aside, and stood erect on the spot allotted to the doomed. The horrible lottery went on in solemn silence, only broken by the sobs of the Mexican officers,—the sneering laugh of the gallant Register, who cried, `Life,' or `Death,' as though he was but marking the result of a game of cards. You may believe me, that it was a sad scene. The sun never shone on a sight more harrowing. Two by two they advanced, these heroes of Mier, who had mothers, wives, sisters in the sunny land which they had bought with their blood—the beautiful land of Texas. Not a groan from their lips—no! not even a sigh. Half naked, unshaven, and miserable to look upon, they came, two by two to the urn, raised their faces in the sunset glare, and calmly took their places in the ranks of life and death. At last, when the setting sun trembled on the hill-top, his red disc seen between the cliff and the black cloud above, there stood sixteen men, side by side, on the spot assigned to the condemned. Two Texans only remained to fulfill the conditions of the lottery; there was but one black bean in the urn, and one of the twain must die. Every eye was fixed upon them as they advanced. You see the tallest of the two, a man of sinewy form, and aquiline face. His broad chest quivers beneath its covering of rags— ah! unmanly spectacle—there are tears in his large dark eyes. Why these tears?—for himself? Look at the prisoner chained to his wrist, and answer! A very boy; scarce sixteen, with a girlish form, and smooth, beardless cheek, and strangely lustrous blue eyes. His face, too, is worn by famine; but there is a calm, almost holy light upon his soft features; he looks up into the face of the robust man, and a sad smile wreathes his lips. `Fear not for me, brother—I'll not play the coward!' he says, in a distinct firm tone. `Fear not for you,' and a hoarse groan swelled the broad chest of the bearded Texan. `By — I swear, I do not fear for you; you shall not die. No—no! That would be a little too hard for the devil himself to think. Hark ye, Harry'—this in a hasty whisper— `let me draw first: the black bean is smaller than the white—I can tell one from the other by the touch. I will—' The younger brother replied by thrusting his hand into the urn. There was one groan thrilling from every lip in the courtyard. The chivalric Register alone regarded the scene with a pleasant smile, and politely asked,— `The color of the bean?' `Black!' cried the heroic boy, turning with a triumphant smile to his brother. That brother wrung his manacled hands and bowed his head upon his breast—it would have made your blood run cold to see that strong man weeping like a child. `Name?' added the polite Register, smoothing his silken moustache. `Harry Grywin!' replied the boy, in a firm tone. The Register started, his face became pale, almost livid for an instant, but recovering his composure he coolly entered the name. Murmuring, `Harry Grywin—Death!' This scene did not pass unobserved. No! The doomed sixteen men saw it, the Mexican officers shuddered as they beheld the black bean in the hands of the girlish boy, and ten Texans stepped from the ranks of the living exclaiming incoherently,— `I will take his place.'—`By — you cannot kill that boy!'—`Behold us! We will die in his stead!' But a voice deeper than all rung through the court yard,— `Who talks of dying for Harry Grywin, when his brother, I, John Grywin, am here? Look you, he is but a child—you cannot put him to death. The foolish boy saw the bean before he drew it—he denied himself the shadow of a chance. Take me!' His tall form swelled in every fibre as he towered erect, the red glow of the setting sun lighting up his aquiline features, framed in masses of hair and beard as black as jet. `Take! Look you, my Mexican friends, I do not owe you much love. I have cut and carved you in battle, as I would cut and carve again, had I free field and a good knife. But now I will stoop to you, kneel to you. Come, priest, tell it to them in Spanish, only so that you will let me die in place of Harry here, for as there's a God, he looks the very image of his mother.' The tones of that strong man, his tears, his gestures, had a language which went like a fiery arrow to every heart. `This must not go on,' shouted the veteran Colonel, rushing forward,—`These men shall not die! And the boy; Holy Trinity! it would be sacrilege to kill him.' The Register sprang upon the log, with his fine form and handsome face revealed against the sunset sky. `Fall back, Colonel; I command here,' he said, quietly waving his hand. `But your Excellency,—Don Antonio Marin—' At that name, John Grywin looked up and surveyed the handsome form of the Register, Don Antonio Marin. It was horrible to remark the strange pallor of the Texan's face, the iron impression of his bearded lips. `Don Antonio Marin!' he exclaimed;`Oh sir, I am glad to know you!' `Separate these heretics,' shouted Don Antonio with rapid utterance and violent gestures. Quick, I say! The sun is setting and it must be over before he is below the horizon. Soldiers, advance by platoons; to your duty—present—fire!' It was done like a lightning flash. Harry was separated from the brother's side, hurried away into the ranks of the Doomed; there was a report like separate claps of thunder, mingling in one awful peal, and a mass of blueish smoke rolled over the scene. Groans, prayers, low-muttered curses mingling in chorus! Do you see the smoke-shroud roll aside for a moment? That old man on his knees, lifting his hands in prayer? The red blaze pours into his face and the smoke-cloud rolls over them all. Peal on peal, volley on volley, and now the whole courtyard is veiled in smoke. An awful silence. The smoke slowly rolls aside. Ah, those mangled forms, with here and there a limb quivering with the last impulse of life, a hand raised, but to fall stiff and frozen to the ground, a face uplifted, with the blood pouring over the hollow stomach, which but a moment ago were eyes. There, on the log, beside the fatal urn, stands Don Antonio Marin, gazing coolly on the bloody heap of dying and dead, while his curling hair, and silked beard, and smooth olive cheek glow richly in the sun, as he lights a cigareto and emits volumes of perfumed smoke from his vermillion lips. Near him, John Grywin, frozen into a dead stupor, his hands clasped, and his vacant gaze rolling from the mangled forms to the soldiers and last of all resting on that prominent figure. Don Antonio, standing on the log and puffing his cigareto with infinite relish, his face and beard encircled by clouds of fragrant smoke—as the sun dips below the horizon and night rushes on the scene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. THE LADY OF VERA CRUZ. It was on the ninth of March, 1847, that Winfield Scott, landed with 12,000 Americans, on the very coast where Cortes, with 300 Spaniards had landed three centuries ago. —Texan MSS. The white arm of a woman, thrust through the staples of that massive door, with the iron pressed against the delicate flesh, supplied the place of a bolt and held the panels firm. It was a fearful thing to behold that arm, quivering and almost crushed by the sturdy blows which fell against the opposite side of the door. And yet the arm was firm, pressed by the heavy panels of the door, against the rusted staples, into which it was inserted, it trembled like a withered reed, the small fingers, straightened with intense agony, the skin was rent by the overwhelming pressure, but still it was there—the only bolt of the iron-bound door. The scene was a narrow room, with a lofty ceiling and floor of dark grey stone.— From the tapestry on either side, marked with the figures 1716, the portraits of grave Hidalgos, encircled by heavy frames, and manifesting in their steel armor, their bearded faces and helmetted brows, distinct traces of the age of chivalry, frowned gloomily on that brave and lonely woman. The only light which imparted its faint glow to the place wrs a small lamp uplifted in the left arm of the maiden. Her right arm was inserted in the place of a bolt. For some two or three feet around her the rays of the lamp fell warm and glaring; beyond that circle of light in which she stood all was gloom, and the extreme end of the apartment was enveloped in thick darkness. For a single moment all is still as death. While this dead silence broods on the place, while the thick darkness hangs over its distant extreme, and the faces of warrior Spaniards frown from the tapestried walls, we will gaze upon this brave yet delicate girl. Her half-naked form is pressed quiveringly against the dark mahogany panels. That massive door supplies a black background to the lithe outlines of her shape, and strongly relieves the alabaster whiteness of her shoulders, her feet, her arms and bosom. A solitary garment, hastily gathered around her waist, falls in careless and loosening folds to the floor. Her young bosom heaves freely in the light. You may trace the agitation which swells her heart to bursting, in the almost imperceptible quivering of the nostril.— You may read it in that silent compression of the warm, red lips. It brightens wildly in those dark eyes, dilating in their sockets, and gleaming a steady lustre from the shadow of the long black lashes. A single vein, swoollen as though it was about to burst, shoots upward from her brows and mars the pale beauty of her forehead. Her hair—there is not a breath to stir it into motion—falls in one mass of glossy blackness over her right shoulder. Her form is neither tall nor masculine.— She trembles before us, one of that diminutive shapes which supply in grace and lightness what they lack in height and majesty. A slender form, yet blooming freshly in the full bosom; warm, almost voluptuous, in the flowing outline of the broad shoulders and rounded arms; beautiful in the stainless whiteness of her small feet and hands, wild and flashing with the light of large deep eyes that seem to burn as they dilate. Altogether one of those small yet impetuous daughters of the South, who resemble the tigers in their stealthy tread and, not in each movement only, but also in their love and their revenge. What means this picture, framed by the darkmahogany panels of the massive door? This solitary room, gloomy with tapestry and moth eaten portraits, floored with stone, and with a single doorway, at either extreme?— the white arm, thrust through the iron staples, the enlarging eye and bared bosom, throbbing with death-like emotion? Wherefore, with a picture, so mysterious and yet so beautiful in its very danger and mystery, commence this new page in this legend of the golden and bloody land? From this dim room, faintly illumined by the lamp that quivers in the uplifted arm of the maiden, we will go forth, on our pilgrimage, through the dusky battle-gods and sepulceres of Mexico. It is in the Home that the bolt of war descends in its most terrible glare and reaps its most precious harvest of blood; in the Home we will raise the curtain, and lay bare the awful theatre of revenge, over whose blood-stained bounds glide the phantoms of human passion. Hark! this silence, so death-like, is broken by the sound of repeated blows, hurled against the opposite side of the door. Deep voices are heard in the interval between each blow. `Open, sister! Your brother demands entrance into this chamber!' `Open, Isora; it is your betrothed that calls!' One quick and intense glance toward yonder door, almost hidden in the gloom—it is the door of her bed chamber; and the girl silently withdrew her arm. The blood starts from the white skin, and a livid streak deforms its alabaster loveliness. The door swings slowly into the room;— two figures are disclosed, half-advanced from the shadows of the doorway. A monk and a soldier; the monk with his pale face sunken on his folded arms; the soldier with an unsheathed sword gleaming in the light. `Sister!' said the monk, in a voice at once sad and reproachful, `this dishonor is too great to be borne. An American—aye, a heretic, a spy, is discovered at dead of night, in the streets of Vera Cruz. He is pursued by Mexicans; his accursed life is in their power; and lo! a Mexican girl, the orphan child of Don Antonio Marin gives shelter to this spy—a shelter in the home of her dead father, shelter in the secresy of her bed-chamber!' `Where is he?' hissed the soldier, as his bearded face and tinselled form were disclosed in the light; `this sword shall anticipate the vengeance of the gibbet.' The half-naked girl stood like a thing of marble, the light raised in her uplifted arm.— Silently she gazed with her large eyes on her brother and her betrothed. That brother, a man of some thirty years, whose pale and beardless face stood out distinctly from the long and flowing robe of his order. There was a silent scorn about his colorless lip; an agony of shame, in the glance of his eyes, as they dilated in his death-like face. By his side, his drawn sword grasped in a firm hand, stood the soldier, quivering with silent rage Clad in a green uniform, spangled with ornaments of every shape and device, his w de trowsers glittering with gold lace, a pistol in his belt, and his small eyes twinkling from a mass of dark hair and beard, he presented an effective contrast to the pale face and sombre attire of the monk. `Brother,' replied the girl, in a tone that was firm in its very tremulousness, `it is false; there is no spy here. Yonder is my bed-chamber, search it.' Her red lip curled in quiet scorn, and with her blood-stained arm she silently lifted her loosened robe upon her bosom, blushing like a beautiful sunset, in that action of maidenly modesty. `But we saw him enter;' vociferated the soldier. `We traced him along the corridor—aye, to this very room! He is here and his life is ours.' You should have seen the girl turn the silent scorn of her large dark eyes upon his face. `It is Don Augustin, then, who enters like a robber, at dead of night, the bed chamber of his betrothed. My brother may hold himself excused; he is but a monk, and knows but little of the respect due a woman, a maiden. But you, the soldier, the cavalier, the gallant. O! chivalric Don Augustin. Her lip curling, her head thrown back, she flashed the light of her dark eyes upon his lowering visage. His head drooped, the point of his sword touched the floor. The scorn of that half-clad and lonely maiden cut him to the very quick. Meanwhile the monk, with his arms folded, his head sunken,regarded his sister with a silent look — long, searching, and full of agony. `We traced the spy to this apartment,' he said in a voice that scarcely rose above a whisper. `There is but one door, besides this through which we have entered. The other door is yonder, and it leads into your bed chamber. Sister, we will reach that room.' What means that head turned hurriedly over her shoulder, that glance toward the distant door? Does the maiden fear the search? Her face was very pale, as she turned once more, and with flashing eyes, besought her brother `not to profane with his midnight intrusion the sanctity of her chamber and her couch.' The monk stood silent and confused—ashamed to advance and unwilling to recede— but the tinselled Don Augustin sprang forward, sword in hand, toward the door of her bed-room. With one sudden and impetuous bound, that slender girl darted before him, and shield ed the door with her outspread arms. She shone very beautiful in the action. Again the dark robe fell, and with the darker hair, relieved the soft loveliness of her virgin breast. `Back! It is not for you to enter here!' And as the flash of her indignant eyes met his cowering gaze, he started back, ashamed of the meanness of his purpose. `Brother advance! It is for you to commit this outrage, alone.' Slowly, ds though every step was clogged with a leaden weight, the brother advanced and laid his hands upon the dark panels of the door. `Why do you hesitate?' said the maiden, as her bosom throbbed in long and deep pulsations. `Are you afraid?' Her words were brave, but pallor of her face, the unnatural brightness of her eyes, told the story of her intense agony. It was a picture, to live upon the memory forever. The room so dark, and the dusks faces frowning from the tapestried wall; these three figures near the doorway,—the maiden, with her bared bosom and uplifted light, shining down upon her pale face; the monk, with one foot advanced, one hand laid upon the panels; the soldier with his head bowed, his sword lowered, gazing with upturned eyes upon the sister and the brother, his chest heaving with suspense. The strong light upon these figures, and the gloom all around—it was a most impressive scene; and a silence like the grave, added awe to that moment of anxious hesitatation. `I will enter,' said the monk. He pushed open the door and disappeared at the same moment. The sister sank on her knees, while a groan of intense agony swelled her bosom. Yes, with her hair, falling over her face, she covered her eyes with one hand, and the other, grasping the light drooped by her side. Don Augustin, like a statue of surprise, stood as if chained to the floor, gazing in mute horror upon the kneeling woman. He was a soldier, and had done brave work in many a battle, done hideous butchery in many a memorable Texan field; but now the damps of fear started from his cold forehead. He was afraid. He listened to the sound of footsteps within that chamber, he heard a deep-toned ejaculation, and then all was dead silence. The sword of Don Augustin shook as the tremor of his arm agitated the gilded hilt. `Thou art false, Isora!' he whispered, as his parting lips disclosed his white teeth firmly set together. She did not raise her head. Cowering on the floor, her robe, her hair, mingled in wild disorder, she pressed her left hand against her forehead and laid her head against the panels of her chamber door. And thus they kept their fearful watch; the maiden and her plighted husband. She, the orphan child of an honored race of old Castile, now trembling in fear and shame, as her brother searched her chamber. He, a brave and cruel soldier, quivering in fear of that dishonor which seemed glaring in his face from the sombre panelling of the fatal door. Within the chamber! We will follow the footsteps of the monk. He entered, and the sanctity of his sister's bed room lay open to his gaze. It was a cool and quiet place, hung with faint crimson curtains, a single window opening on a garden to the north, a solitary light placed in a niche before an image of the Virgin Mary. The perfume of flowers imparted a delicious sweetness to the sultry air. Beautiful in their rainbow hues, they were clustered in a vase near the window. In one corner stood the maid's couch, yet bearing the outlines of her shape on its silken pillows. The monk advanced—trembling he took the light and searched the room. There was no one there. All was silent and deserted. That light fell over the bed, revealed the folds of the silken hangings, the flowers by the window, and the Virgin smiling from the recess, but it did not disclose the form of a living thing. `The spy is not here!' he gasped, and approached the window. `He cannot have escaped in this way; the leap were certain death!' He looked down into the garden, where flowers and shrubbery were grouped, in a wilderness of perfume, and then, through the interval of the vines which clustered round the window frame, he saw the mild, sad light of the stars. `This is strange;' he murmured, as he approached the image of the Virgin. `As I live, he entered this room, and yet I can discern no trace of his footsteps.' As he spoke, a dim, distant, murmuring sound, like the tramp of ten thousand men on a sandy shore, came through the thick walls of that ancient mansion. The monk groaned as he bit his lips in impotent rage. `They come, the heretics, the invaders!' But what is the sight that fixes the glance of his burning eyes? The statue of the Virgin has been moved from its place in the recess: the monk remembers the old-time legends of his paternal mansion, and at a glance discovers the entrance to that secret stairway, leading from the bed-chamber to the roof. `Ah!' he groaned, with an oath in pure Castilian, `I have tracked the wolf to his lair!' It was the work of second to spring forward through that holy image, open wide the narrow door and glide into the darkness of the secret stairway. Ten steps upward—steps of stone, built in the thickness of the walls—and he stood upon the flat roof, amid the battlemented walls of the mansion, with the light of the stars upon his brow. A hand was laid upon his arm; the stern, stern gripe of these iron fingers forced an involuntary murmur of pain. Fiercely the monk turned, his lip compressed, his brow scowling—it was his impulse to hurl the intruder from the roof. But the scowl passed from his brow ere he drew another breath. His lips parted, the indignant flash of his eye was succeeded by a vacant stare. He felt his blood curdle in his veins. For there, in the pale light of the stars, rose a tall form, swelled to gigantic proportions by the gloom, and a voice low and deep, which thrilled to the inmost heart of the monk, whisperee these words,— `Remember the Rancho Saldo, and look yonder!' While that death-like clasp tightened on his arm, the monk recognized the voice, and trembled like a frightened child before the spectre of some goblin story. Quivering with a fear more terrible to behold because its source is unknown to us, the monk beheld the sight which spread before him. It was a sight to swell the heart with a vague yet overwhelming sense of the sublime. Let us stand beside him on the roof of the mansion which overlooks the main square of the town, and gaze upon the vision which he beheld and feel its dusk sublimity rush thro' the eyesight to our souls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. THE LANDING AT VERA CRUZ. `Winfield Scott in the footsteps of Cortes.' —Texan MSS. Above, the sky of night, that dome of deep and tranquil blue, shining with the gleam of the stars. Beneath, the town of Vera Cruz, its roofs and towers, rising indistinctly in the gloom, with the Grand Plaza, right before us, encircled by noble structures, and the sandy shore, stretching as far as eye can see, to the norte and south, in dreary barrenness. Yonder, to the north-east, above the waves, glooms the castle of San Juan de Ulloa; a dark pile, rising sullenly into night, with the Mexican flag, waving from its loftiest tower. Toward the east the waves break in low murmurs against the barren isle of Sacrificios, barren to the sight, yet bearing in its bosom mysterious chambers, stored with relics of six hundred years ago. Beyond the Castle and the Fort spreads the illimitable waste of the trackless gulf, a world of waves, reaching out into the vague night until it kisses the world of sky. Landward we gaze: beyond the waste of sand and the dark line of forest and hill, a colossal mass, white as snow, towers serenely into the western sky. That white mass, rising in its lone magnificence from the distant horizon, its sublime summit rushing proudly into heaven, is the Peak of Orizaba; the altar of this glorious temple which has the waste of sand and forest and the sweep of the vast ocean, for its floor, the sky for its dome, the stars of God for its sacrificial lights. It is one of those scenes which glide into the soul and fill it with a sublimity that has no speech. No word escapes our lips, no sudden ejaculation give vent to our awe. Here we gaze, the ocean is before us, the gloomy castle rising from its waves,—there, and Orizaba glares like the ghost of past ages from the western sky. For a moment we turn our gaze, from the ocean and the mount, to the city that sleeps before us, that home of plague, nestling on the low and sandy shore, called Vera Cruz. The mansion, on whose roof we stand, lies east of the Plaza. Yonder, to the west, with its front to the eastern sky, towers the Cathedral, a noble structure, whose dome and cross are lost to view in a vague mass of blackness. What means this blackness that seems to undulate, like a cloud as we gaze upon it? That dome is black with vultures—look! Upon the cross, rising high in the serene air, crouches the sentinel of the band; an omen of death and blood, nestling upon the emblem of Jesus and Peace! He will have a brave feast ere many days, that gory vulture, resting to-night on the highest Cross of Vera Cruz. There, on the south of the square, rises another church, or mass of churches, swarming with buzzards, black even to the cross, with those birds of death. Ere a month has passed, those churches will be blasted into ruins; the bodies of the dead will darken their altars; the vulture pick his ghastly meal even in their most holy places. Before us, on the east of the square, we behold the National Palace, surmounted by the tri-colored flag of Mexico. And from this Plaza, shadowed in deep night, by those noble forms of architectural grandeur, extend the smooth-pebbled streets of Vera Cruz, overhung with balconied windows, gay with many-colored awnings, and rendered uniform by a wide extent of level roofs. It is is indeed a beautiful town. Far out on the sea—like a gleam from Italy or Asia, —the voyager beholds it, with its towers and cupolas, rising from the waste of sand; while far above smiles the serene Orizaba. In the calm evening hour when the white peak blushes in the sun, and the smile of the dying day is upon wave, castle and shore, these balconies are crowded with beautiful women whose white fingers gleam through the intervals of flowers, while their gracefully gathered mantle cannot altogether hide the glance of their dark eyes, the red warmth of their lips, the the passionate heaving of their veiled bosoms. And yet from this town, so sublime with its distant Orizaba, so beautiful with its warm southern women, its tropical flowers, so grand with tower and dome, the Plague every year hurls two thousand people to their graves. One third of its houses are ravaged every year by that pestilence, which wings its dead-liest dart where the verdure is freshest, the sky most serene, the flowers most beautiful. To-night another, a deadlier plague threatens Vera Cruz. What mean these batteries erected everywhere about the city, hemming its houses in a wall of latent flame? Wherever you gaze, not an inch of ground beyond the walls of the town but is commanded by some deadly engine of war. To the North, you behold Fort Conception, to the left Fort Santiago, one mile from the city, with a belt of water between, San Juan De Ulloa all formidable with cannon, all prepared for the hurricane of hattle. What foreign enemy will dare assail the impregnable castle, the city of the Gulf, defended by a wall of steel, by the invisible barrier of the Plague? Hark! There is a strange sound to the south—that waste of sand is black with shadowy forms—the tread of ten thousand men fills the air with a sound like the first moaning of a thunder storm. Gaze upon the channel which glides between the castle and the Isle of Sacrificios. Even as the light breeze crisps the waters into tiny ripples, we behold glooming through the night the dark forms of ships of war, some white with sails, some sending the smoke of their steam-engines into the starlit sky. The night is dark, we may not trace distinctly the shapes of these vessels, nor count their cannon, nor estimate the awful power of their death machinery, but they are there, gently undulating upon the smooth waters, their decks black with warriors, the banner of the stars waving over all, as if to flash back unto heaven the smile of the cloudless sky. What means the banner of the stars floating over the Gulf of Mexico? Look! There are barges upon the waters, gliding as noiselessly as any gondola of Venice, that bears the lover to his mistress's smile, gliding from the ships to the shore, and bearing armed men to the plague-smitten shore of Vera Cruz. Does not the scene rivet your gaze—fill your heart. You see those boats extended in the form of a crescent, approach the sands, while the water breaks in foam around their prows— the bayonets twinkle like fireffies through the darkness, a vague murmur stealing over the waves, swells along the shore like the hushed whispers of ten thousand men! They come on, those death-boats, bearing many a true heart to the hideous grave of the pestilence, they grate upon the pebbly beach, there is a flag waving through the gloom, and the forms of armed men start into view far along that drear, that barren shore. Where is now the thunder of San Juan de Ulloa? Look!—that slight elevation of sand commands the shore, a single cannon planted there would hurl a thousand men back into the waves, and redden with blood the ripples as they gurgled over these mangled `falls'? Is there not one true-hearted Mexican, only one, to place the cannon and fling the lighted match to his fatal work? Not one? For there is a doom upon the land, the hardy children of the North are here, the soldiers of the new crusade throng the waters and the shore, at least twelve thousand strong, and there is not one Mexican to meet them on the beach with the warm welcome of a warrior's steel. At sunset you should have beheld the scene, for if it is impressive now, at sunset it was most beautiful! It was a calm afternoon, on the ninth of March, 1847. The glow of sunset was upon the waveless waters of the Mexican Gulf, upon the city of Vera Cruz, with its roofs and towers, centred on the sandy shore, upon the dark castle, glowing to the north, and those beams so vivid in their tropical glare hung in a baptism of life around the far-off Peak of Orizbaa. There, in that sweet, sad calm of the evening breeze, which makes the stranger in a foreign land dream of home, a strange sight was seen by the light of the setting sun. The roofs of Vera Cruz were black with people. The soldier sprung to the battlement and held his breath as he gazed. From yonder castle the gay group of Mexican generals looked forth upon the tranquil wa ters. Every eye was centred upon the channel, between the castle and sacrificios, and every heart beat quicker at the splendid panorama, warmed by the sunset rays. For the huge Princeton came gliding over the waves, urged swiftly on by her tremendous machinery, with the smoke curling over her masts, and melting into the serene gold of the upper sky. The dark form, the white sails of the other vessels, swept black and glittering in the centre. She seemed, that fearful Princeton, renowned for the bloody tragedy once enacted on her decks, like the head of a huge serpent trailing its sinuous way over the calm waters. As the fleet approached the Isle of Sacrificios, the armed men crowded on the decks, their weapons flashing in back the glare of the sun, cast their gaze to the west, and saw the desolate shore spreading wide and dreary as the waves broke over its sands. The city crowded on its every roof with the men, the women, the mothers and daughters of Vera Cruz are there—the vessels of other nations anchored in the harbor, their masts alive with silent spectators, and in the distance Orizaba seemed to woo them on. Orizaba, that soon would see them hurled by hundreds into the plague-pit, or crushed in bloody heaps upon the battle field! In the shrouds of the steamer Massachusetts, at this moment of intense expectation, stands a man of some sixty years, his form unbent from its stern majesty by the toil of battle or the frost of age, clad in a costume magnificent in its severe simplicity. Blue, relieved by gold,—a broad chest heaves beneath that uniform, a kingly form supports that warrior head. His brow was bared: you could see the gray hairs curling round it; the sunset glow upon those firm features, every line glowing with a warrior soul. Over his head, and around him, throwing his expressive form distinctly into view, waves in slow undulations the banner of the stars. His eye brightening as it expands, roves over the scene, and he remembers that bloody field fought years ago, within the thunder of Niarara, and looks forward with a quickening pulse to these words, which history will soon write in characters of light—`Winfield Scott, in the footsteps of Cortes!' With twelve thousand men, their lives, their honor, hanging on his fiat, this man of Niagara sees the American army approach the land of Mexico Hark!—the thunder of a signal cannon breaks the silence, a volume of blue cloud sweeps over the form of Scott. That is the signal gun! And parting from the vessels' sides, as they swing at anchor near the Isle, a line of barges, crowded with soldiers, sweep toward the shore. It is a beautiful thing to see them come spread forth in the form of a crescent, which flings the glitter of four thousand bayonets over the waves. On towards the sands—nearer and nearer —in sight of the city and the fort, the object of the gaze of thousands, these veterans of Monterey, these men of Louisiana and Kentucy, approach the hostile shore. That form, standing erect in the foremost barge, with the light playing upon the muscular chest; the uniform of blue glittering with gold, the deep eye, gleaming beneath the waving plumes, as white as snow? Over all he towers; the American Flag grasped in one hand, the unsheathed sword flashing in the other. Behind him, the fleet; before him, the shore; far above, the white altar, Orizaba. Look upon that banner and read in its blood-stained folds the single word, `Monterey!' Gaze upon that waving plume; it gleamed like a beacon through the three days fight of the Mountain City; it waves above the brow of Worth, whose eye flashes again as he prepares to spring from the barge, and plant the banner upon the sands of Mexico. Silence reign, only broken by the sweep of the oars; now hearts are beating impetuously beneath their warrior covering; the setting sun shines over compressed lips and woven brows. A moment of fearful suspense! Nearer to the shore glides the toremost barge. You see Worth lift at once his sword and banner; with one hurried glance he surveys the hostile beach—the city five miles distant, the harbor white with sails; and then casting his face, so chivalric in its ripe manhood, to the glow of the setting sun, he springs upon the shore. In silence he plants the banner staff upon the sands and uncovers his brow. Ten thousand eyes behold the picture. That solitary soldier, standing alone upon the beach, the waves curling at his feet, the Banner of the Continent waving over his head. The golden sands relieve his form, the evening breeze lifts the banner into light. Then, and not till then, the ominous silence is broken by a thunder shout. It is the heart-warm cheer of our thousand brave men. Look upon them as they come! With one impulse they plunge into the waves and dash onward, lifting their glittering arms into the light,— they cannot wait until the barges grate the sand, but springing into the water, mid-breast deep, they hurry forward, and encircle with a guard of hearts and steel, the noble form of Worth. The last gleam of the setting sun disclosed that barren shore, clouded by the firm array of six thousand men, with the gloomy outlines of cannon and mortar, seen disitnctly even amid the flash of these long belts of dazzling steel. Darkness gathers on the ocean and the shore; one by one the prominent points of the picture went out in the gloom. First, the shore faded; and the soldiers, in their beautiful array, became a vague mass of moving blackness, their presence known by their thunder tread alone. The domes of the city glittered for a moment and then were dark; the huge castle sank into the bosom of night the ocean reached forth its waves and melted through the dusky air into the distant horizon. And when the shadow was upon the ocean and the shore, like a mantle of tangible darkness, still, in the west, Orizaba lifted its white altar into heaven, and while all was black below, the last rays of the departing day hung round its glossy pinnacle like a smile from God. Now it is dark night, illumined only by the stars. While the American legions are hurrying from the battle ships to the shore, and extending in silent and terrible arry around the slumbering city, our souls are hurried by the stern emotions of the hour, back into the bosom of the Dead Ages. Three hundred years ago, and the same lone Orizaba, that towers serenely now, flashing its calm scorn upon the petty broils of man, smiling calmly on, whether he marches to battle in glittering array, or sinks disfigured and horrible, into the loathsome pit of the plague—that same Grizaba beheld a far different scene. Then, the great woods sent forth their arms of foliage and flowers even to the ocean shore. The palm grew near the waters, a straight column, towering into upper air, with a coronal of broad leaves and luscious fruit around its brow. The cypress, too, that stern monarch of dead centuries, rose here, with all manner of rainbow flowers, blooming round its massive trunk, and vines of various beauty hanging about its branches. Then, the desert sand, where San Juan de Ulloa glooms, was a fair green isle. Sacrificios yonder, was the Temple Isle of a strange and mysterious religion. Upon its sands, among the gay glory of the tropical vegetation, the horrible altars rose, dripping with the warm blood of the human sacrifice. Beneath its surface were chambers reared in the barbarous yet im pressive architecture of the people, whose name has for thousands of years been lost to human lips. Wonderful chambers were those, hidden beneath the sand, gloomy with images of the devil, God; and burrowing far into the caverns beneath the ocean waves. Then, it is of the time, three hundred years ago we speak: a wondrous people dwelt in this land, amid gorgeous cities, or in the silence of the beautiful vallies, their dusky faces, glowing with the same passions that fill our bosoms now, the fury of war, the avaricious lust of traffic, the magnetic tenderness of love. Yes, beside this shore many a great lord, clad in garments that were woven with feathers of rainbow dyes, and dazzling with ornaments of solid gold, strode proudly along, followed by the innumerable column of his half-naked and dusky warriors. Yes, beneath yonder cypress, in those days that are now almost forgotten, crouched the dark-cheeked but impetuous daughter of the South, looking with her large deep eyes upon the brown child that slept upon her bosom. Yes, upon yonder isle the chaunt of prayer was heard, the altar smoke arose, the yell of the victim— forced to the altar, his heart torn from his living body—shrieked in horrible cadence upon the still air, and died far along upon the waves. The ruler of this land dwelt in a valley, some hundred of miles to the west, in a tranquil valley of blossoms, whose gardens and lakes were guarded by volcanic mountains. At once the High Priest of the awful religion and the Emperor of the people, he was called the `Sad Warrior,' or in the Aztec language, Montezuma. Wherefore called the Sad or Doomed Warrior? It is a strange story, and I will speak it in few words. The religion of this vast people, which raised its altars in every city, and sent its sacrificial flames into the sky, from every mountain, comprised the worship of two deities. Like all the religions, or rather forms of religion in the world, it adored two gods,—a God of Blood, a God of Peace. The God of Blood, in some lands, demanded the offerings of an lnquisition, pledged to do the works of hell on earth, on the victims of persesution, slain without mercy on the battle fields of bigotry. In Mexico, this God of Blood demanded merely the palpitating heart of a solitary victim, who was stretched upon the altar stone, amid the gaze of thousands, and torn to death with his livid brow crowned with blossoms.— This victim was slain on stated occasions of solemn ceremonial, not in the gloomy hall of an inquisition's dungeon, nor in the Molock-sacrifice of a Genevan stake. In all lands of the world, the God of Peace received the worship of the purest hearts.— The brutal man, swayed by the bigot's lust, into hellish frenzy, loved Him not. But his name was written in serene skies, in waveless lakes, in all that was tender and beautiful in the world, as much in the bared beauty of a stainless woman's bosom as in the lone majesty of the mountain top, smiling in the last gleam of an unclouded sun. After ages of darkness, this God was clearly written in the Bible—He shone an image of Time joined to Eternity, in the serene Jesus. In the land of Mexico, three hundred years ago, this God—only revealed to the Aztec people in the language of external nature, or the voiceless eloquence of the heart—was seen in the blossoms, in the cloudless skies, in all the tenderness and sanctity that whispers in the syllable Home. It their traditions, which called him Quet-zalcoatt, it was taught that he had lived in the Mexican land, some thousand years before; that He had been banished, in his golden reign of peace, and driven from this very shore by the God of Blood. But a glorious hope lived in their traditions that he would return and bless the land again, nnd reign the Messiah of the Heart. In this hope lived Montezuma; but priest and king as he was, of a despotic government and a barbarous religion, the hope soon became to him a nightmare fear; he looked for the return of the good God with trembling, and saw the coming of the blessed age, with the terror of self-convicted guilt. He was doomed to destruction from his birth, by Prophecy, and the coming of the blessed Quet-zalcoatt was to ripen his doom into judgement. Therefore, from his birth, he was called Montezuma, or the Doomed Man. Did the Messiah come? Yes, but not the God Peace, nor the apostle of the God of Peace, but a stern Messiah, whose crucifix was the hilt of his sword, whose black banner bore a red csoss, with the words,—`In this sign we conquer.' A single picture from the life of this Messiah of Blood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO. `In order to estimate the present we must look upon the past. `I will tell you,' said the veteran, `a story of the days of old, in order that you may understand that which I have to state of,—the ninth of March, 1847.” —Texan MSS. Upon the sandy shore a white tent arose, shadowed by the deep-green leaves of a cypress tree. Around that tent were grouped a band of warriors attired in linked steel, their bearded faces surmounted by iron helmets, an iron sword in each sinewy hand. A deep murmur thrilled through the group, and the last gleam of the fading light revealed the various passions,—anger, despair, hope—contending for the mastery in every warrior's face. While they surrounded the tent, flinging their mailed hands in fierce gesticulations, in the air, the light of sunset mellowed the waveless ocean, and the waters melted without a sound upon the pebbled shore. Around was the glowing panorama of fruit and flowers: from the thickly clustered foliage the purple grape, the fragrant fig, the golden orange, were seen, while over all arose the melancholy palm, so lone in its majesty; the strong cypress, so big, in every inch of its rugged bark, with the history of ast years. And over all, far away to the west, the cloudless blue of the evening sky was broken by a colossal mass, white as sunless snow. It was a wild and yet a beautiful scene.— That group of warriors, beared from the mouth to the throat, and clad in mail of iron, clustered about the white tent, their warhorses, also iron-clad, standing near; the golded sand stretching far to the north and south; to the east, the ocean, vast, calm and trackless; in the west, the serene peak of Orizaba. Attracted by the sound of those earnest voices, speaking deeply, in pure Castilian, we enter the group and start back, wondering and dumb, as we behold the two figures that form the centre of the circle. A man of thirty-three years, clad in glittering steel armor, his form at once agile and athletic, is seated there, upon a rock; his helmet laid aside, his hands clasping that sword whose hilt pierces the sand. A face, high and bold in the forehead, thoughtful, almost sad, with the light of those eyes, so unnaturally large and dark,; firm in the silent compression of the bearded lip— altogether the face of an enthusiast and a warrior. Were it not for the air of practical energy which invests the face we should say, at the first glance, that we beheld in that mail-clad man, a dreamer, cased in armor instead of a cowl. While all are moved by the tempest of passion, he alone is calm. Yes, while the monk at the right surveys the group, and clasps his crucifix in prayer, while the splendid warrior on the left, whose battle-steel shines with drops of gold, seizes his sword, and with a scornful lip, confronts the group, this man, with the uncovered brow, is firm and colds a marble. `The ships which bore us to this accursed land, you have destroyed!' shouted an athletic man, whose dogged features, half-hidden in his hair and beard, announce a reckless nature. `By the Holy Trinity, we are here in a heathen land, at the mercy of the savages —our bones will bleach upon their altars before many days!' And a chorus of fierce ejaculations disturbs the silence of the evening hour. `Pity us, Mother of God! We shall never see Castile again.' `Never! Our ships, torn to pieces, rot beneath yonder wave; the madness of this man hath undone us all.' `Conquer a nation like this, a nation of millions, ruled by a great king! It is madness to think it.' The man with the uncovered brow heard it all, with his large eyes fixed upon the sand. Not a word passed his lips. `Back!' shouted the splendid knight, who with drawd sword stood by him; `dare you menace the captain?' `For the love of God, my children, be calm,' besought the priest, lifting into light the holy Cross. By this time you have doubtless discovered that the name of the priest was Olmedo, the splendid knight, Alvarado; these mailed forms, the adventurous Spaniards, who landed a few days since on this unknown shore; the central figure, so calm, while all around is storm, Hernan Cortes. He has destroyed their ships. They cannot go back—the ocean is between them and home; before them the wonderous land of Montezuma, swarming with its millions of people, and glorious with its unmeasured stores of gold. This man, Cortes, not long ago an obscure planter of Cuba, has sworn with this little band to conquer the empire of Montezuma! It is indeed madness. At last he lifts his eyes and surveys the angry group. You see the madness of his dream in the deep flush which reddens his cheek, in the unnatural glare of his eye.— That flush, that glare, says more to the warriors than a thousand words, for they tell us that the soul of this man is up within him,— that alone he will accomplish this deed, if not a single arm moves with him. He rises, lays his left hand upon the banner staff—above him the Gonfalon of black velvet, with its red cross; and with his right he raises the blade or his sword slowly over his head. `Be it so!' his deep, indignant voice is heard exclaim. `You all desert me. I will go alone.' Silence! The genius flashing from this man's eyes begins its work upon every heart. Silence, hesitation, suspense! `There is a land to conquer—it is yonder!' —he pointed to the setting sun—`there is gold to win—it is there. There are millions of heathen, whom we can convert to the true cross; they, too, are there. You are afraid to conquer, convert, or win—afraid!—you desert me. It is a crime that I have destroyed your ships. I am guilty; I confess it.— Take your way where you will; as for me, with this sword in my hand, this banner over my head, I will cry to God and his saints and go forth to conquer, alone!' The silence deepens, heads are drooped, upraised arms sink with their swords; with wondering eyes they gaze upon the form of Cortes. Alvardo, so splendid in his knightly array, advances silently to his side,— `Not alone! for I am with you.' `And I!' exclaims the priest Olmed, advancing from the other side. `And I!' exclaims a soft, low, musical voice in Castilian, broken by a strange accent it echoes from the tent and pierces every heart. Two white arms are wound around the neck of Cortes; and pillowed on his right shoulder is seen a warm face, framed in flowing hair, and lighted by large eyes that burn with the religion, the love of a true woman. Who is this beautiful woman, from whose brown cheeks glows the ripeness of fiery blood? So queenly is her form, so voluptuous in every out line—her young limbs trembling beneath a robe of spotless white—so like a passionate woman in her ripe lips, so like a spirit in her large, eloquent eyes? Every Spaniard knows her at a glance. The child of the heathen people, he has forsaken home and altar for the Christian; she has linked her fate with Cortes, saying to him in the beautiful language of the Hebrew maiden to Naomi,—`wherever thou goest, I will go; thy people shall be my people—thy God my God!' Now spreading forth her arms she looks upon the stern soldiers, with that glance, so sublime with woman's faith, and utters the broken words,— `I, too, will go!' Had you turned your eyes for a moment from this group and then looked again, you would have seen the sand crowded qy kneeling men, their eyes gleaming with the frenzy of enthnsiasm, their swords lifted towards the holy banner, their voices joining in the shout —`Mexico and Montezumal Lead us on— we will conquer with you Cortes, or with you, Cortes, we will die!' Orizaba glowed in the setting sun, and the Indian maiden, Mariana, held over the dark hair of Cortes a crown of orange blossoms, with a single blood-red flower in the centre. As the night sank over the scene, she fluttered it gently in the air, and it sank, like a good omen on his brow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. THE AVENGER OF A THREE-FOLD WRONG. Whenever he tried to pray, one word, written in letters of fire, glared between him and God—Remorse.' — Texam MSS. Remember the Rancho Salado and look yonder!' That voice, we say, curdled the blood of the monk. There, beside him, on the roof-top of the old mansion of Vera Cruz, rose a sombre figure, which, in the dim light of the stars, resembled a phantom rather than a man. It was some moments ere the monk could gather nerve to raise his eyes and look upon the shadowy form. At first he saw only a tall figure, attired in grey, with a rifle in his hand, a pale face, encircled by masses of dark hair, with a long black beard clothing the lower part of the visage, and descending to the broad chest. Then, as he saw more clearly, he beheld that white forehead, the dark eyebrows, the aquiline nose, firm mouth—curving with a smile that was almost Satantic—and a rounded chin, appearing from masses of black beard. A frock coat of grey hues, edged on the skirts with dark fur, and girded by a belt of black leather, displayed the sinewy proportions of the stranger. Over his white brow arose a cap of dark fur, with a single long and slender feather, quivering in its front. `You tremble, Father Pedro,'—the voice sounded like a death-knell to the monk— `and yet there is no reason to fear! Come, while the stars gleam above us, while San Juan frowns yonder, and the tramp of ten thousand heretics resound from the sandy beach. Come, I say, sit by me on the battlements, and let me tell you a story—an amusing story, as there is a God! Do not wonder that I speak Spanish with such a glib tongue —I learned the language in an excellent grammar school—rather rough it may be, but still excellent—the castle-prison of Perote!' Father Pedro sank backward on the battlement, his hands hanging motionless by his side. He trembled as with an ague chill— but then the air was so cold. Taking his seat beside the monk, and resting one arm on his rifle, the stranger began his story,— `Did you ever, Father Pedro, in your priestly wanderings, behold a picture like this? A lonely rancho, centered in a valley of barren hills, and illumined on every stone with the dusky glow of a clouded sunset? In the courtyard of that rancho a handsome soldier, standing on a log, shrieks to his blood-hounds, and bids them put to death seventeen men, rebel Texans, who await their fate near the wall—a boy, mark ye, a smooth-faced, girlish boy, standing in their midst? There is a crash, father Pedro, a smoke, and horrible groans, rise from that heap of palpitating forms, which writhe, struggle and die, even on the spot where a moment since, stood seventeen living men. Not a Mexican eye but is wet with tears, not a soldier but pities the miserable men, who are butchered thus in cold blood. Yes; there is one! Cold, relentless, unpitying, while all are weeping round him, stands that handsome officer, Don Antonio Marin!' The Monk shuddered. `But near the gallant officer is seen the brother of the smooth-cheeked boy, waiting until the smoke clears away, so that he may recognize the mangled form of Harry Grywin. That brother is a strong man, Father Pedro, yet he bites his lip until the blood comes—weeps! O, every one of his tears is worth a Mexican's life; and all the while the handsome officer stands smiling at his agony. Come, man, you are dull—why don't you laugh? When the smoke clears away, John the elder brother advances, searches for his girlish brother's body There are sixteen carcasses on the sod, but Harry's is not there!' You may see the head of the Monk fall slowly on his breast. `The scene changes to Saltillo, a beautiful city, some hundred miles and more from the Rancho Salado. Two months have clapsed since the handsome officer halloed his blood-hounds to the slaughter. It is a festival day in Saltillo, the Church lines the street with her banners, her crosses, her glittering robes, extending in gorgeous procession. Above all, above the points of encircling bayonets, shines the Host—` the body and blood of Jesus' shrined in a golden cup. But who comes here, along the streets—this ghastly figure clad in rags, the face thinned by famine, the blue eyes hollow and ghastly? It is a Texan, aye the very boy who, two months since was doomed, shot, in the Rancho Salado, he escaped, wandered among the mountains for two months, and now rushes into the ranks of the procession, screaming for bread! for water! For you see, he is maddened by thirst and hunger! Like a hunted deer, that can drag its bloody trail no longer he turns to his hunters and beseeches mercy! Bread! water! Behold the mercy which is given to him. A file of soldiers separate from the procession, at the command of their leader.— A ghastly figure is kneeling in the centre of the Plaza, the Cathedral before him, the host gleaming above his head. `Present!—fire!' There is a quivering mass of flesh and blood on the stones of the street, and the officer advances, contemplates the form of his victim, or, to put it in plainer words, Don Antonio Marin looks quietly, and with his most winning smile, upon the mangled corse of that boy of sixteen, girlish Harry Grywin.' The monk lifted his eyes and muttered the name of the Holy Trinity. The voice of the stranger echoes clear and deep through the silence of the night,—it pierces the soul of Father Pedro, yet he dare not gaze upon the eyes nor look upon the face of the unknown man. Unknown? `Look yonder, monk.' So careless, so conversational was the tone of the stranger's voice, that the monk raised his eyes. `Yonder, Father Pedro! Not upon the star-lit sky, nor upon the dreary shore of sand —not yet the wooded hills; but yonder, to the north west. What is this that we behold? A Texan home. Reared on an island knoll, some sixty miles from San Antonio, amid a grove of oaks, venerable with their waving festoons of silver moss. Is it not beautiful? The fountain bubbling in the centre of the grove, the rich masses of sua and shade chasing each other over the sod, the world of prairie and sky, spreading around and above that home of Prairie Eden. A father and his three children dwell there, in the wilderness, the free canopy of God above them, and the breath of God hlowing freshly over the prairie, into their dear home of the blossoming desert. But mark ye, Father Pedro, the brothers are called away to San Antonio, called, with the laborers and slaves of the plantation, to defend the frontiers of Texas from Mexican outrage. They are gone only a few brief hours; warned by a supernatural messenger they leave their men encamped and hasten home. They do return home—behold them, after journeying all night, approach the island grave, in the dimness of the daybreak. John is mounted on his black horse, Harry on his ambling bay; and you'll remember John was a muscular man, sure as Death with his rifle; and Harry a mere boy, with such laughing blue eyes that went right into his rude brother's heart. `They are coming home—alone!—for they have left their soldiers on the prairie, thirty miles away. They are in sight of Prairie Eden. Their horses have fallen, but still they hurry on. How beautifully the morning sun shines over the mansion, with the oaks grouped around it, and the white moss quivering in every breath of air. Coming Home! They hear the sound of the fountain, see the porch, ascend the knoll with a merry hurrah; for John begins to think that his presentiment was false—the words of that awful messenger a lie! But what is the sight that meets their eyes as they reach the porch? Where is the father to welcome the children home, where the sister to press her kiss upon her brothers' lips? Look!—ha! ha! the father hangs to the tree before his own door, his dead face gilded by the morning sun—the sister crouched in the porch, a mad, a dishonored woman!' The monk fell on his knees,—`Mercy!— for the sake of the Holy Trinity! No more, no more!' `But the brother, even John, bends over his lost sister. `His name?—the author of this double wrong, the doer of this devil's work?' Hark! that voice from the white lips of the wrecked woman,—`Don Antonio Marin!” As he hissed the last words through his compressed teeth—the monk crouching all the while before him—the stranger dashed his rifle on the flat roof and beat his forehead with his clenched hands. The groan which came from his lips was not human; it resemled the howls of a dying tiger. `You will confess, Father Pedro, that John Grywin and Don Antonio Marin have a long account to settle whenever they may chance to meet. You admit that even if John should discover Don Antonio under the cowl of a monk, his chivalric name, transformed into `Father Pedro,' that it would be a very amuing thing for the said John to stab the good father at dead of night, and pitch his bloody carcass over the battlements into the streets of Vera Cruz. This would be amusing, I say, but very, very far from just. Let me picture a little piece of justice for you. After the lapse of long years, John Grywin finds Don Antonio under the cowl of a monk, his only care, the charge of a beautiful and orphaned sister. Tho monk loves that sister. adores her, even as John adored his sister. Yes, the monk wishes her to marry the chivalric Don Augustin, bestow her wealth on a convent, and live happily for long years, encircled by blooming children. At this crisis of her destiny, John Grywin comes to Vera Cruz, finds entrance into the home of the sister, and night after night, setting by her side, with her soft hands within his own, tells her the moving—somewhat melancholy—story of his life, and wins her heart forever. In this story, mark you, he leaves the names a blank —does not tell the voluptuous Isora, that the name of the assassin and ravisher is Don Antonio Marin. Well, after all his plans are laid, John Grywin, being still in pursuit of justice, brings the threads of destiny together on the night of the 9th of March, 1817. Look yonder, Father Pedro! Behold the barren isle of Sacrificios! There, is the sepulchres of the Aztec race, my bridal bed is waiting for me now. Your sister is pure at this hour —when morning dawns she will repose in my arms, in yonder bridal bed, sacrificed—her honor, purity, all, offered up to the memory of my sister! Come, Monk, unfrock yourself; I want your cowl. It will serve me as a disguise to pass the guard —or stay—ha! ha! Isora shall wear the monkish gown, and I will assume the handsome uniform of Don Augustin.' The monk, Father Pedro, otherwise called Don Antonio Marin, lay prostrate on the roof —prostrate and helpless, as though a palsy had possessed his once vigorous limbs. His eyes were rivetted on the face of the stranger. He suffered him to strip the gown from his form, saw him wind it about his form, and for a moment all was silence. Slowly, heavily the monk raised himself into a sitting posture. The form of the stranger was half lost to view in the aperture of the stairway leading from the roof to the room of Isora. That face, framed in its dark hair and long beard, glared from its large eyes full in the face of the Monk. `One word before we part! Your turn will come; it is not yet time. Do you remember walking some three months since, just before you assumed the cowl, in the Alameda of Mexico, your while-haired father on your arm? It was a beautiful evening; the valley of Mexico glowed with its groves and spires in living light, while far above rose the volcanic mountains, sending their smoke, like incense-clouds into the evening sky. And you, with your white-haired father, were walking amid the blaze of rank and beauty which floated along the Alameda of the gay city.— A bullet from an unknown source, pierced your father's brain. He fell at your feet, his white hairs bathed in blood. Whence came that bullet? You never could guess; in remorse for your crimes, you deemed a vengeance dealt by a supernatural hands, and immediately assumed the cowl, Ha! ha! it is indeed amusing!—that bullet came from the rifle of the escaped prisoner, John Grywin!' `Oh God! my poor father!' `Thus, one by one, I will sweep your family down to death. First your father falls; to-night Isora sinks in the embrace of pollution! Last of all your turn will come, yours, Father Pedro, otherwise called Don Antonio Marin, hero of the Rancho Salado; hero of the Mass at Saltillo; hero of Prairie Eden.' He was gone. It was some moments before the monk recovered his consciousness, He tottered to his feet, and the mild light of the stars shone over his shaven face and revealed his broad forehead and wildly-glaring eyes; there was a damp like death upon his brow; he wiped it away with his chilled hands; but the cold dross started forth again and bathed his clammy flesh. Then gazing toward the ocean, Don Antonio contemplated, with a shudder, the dark history of his life. `I thought it was but revenge when I dishonored Isabel and slew her brother—revenge for the scorn which the proud girl flung in my teeth long years ago, in her Philadelphian home! But now, my father murdered, my sister on the verge of dishonor—I learn at last, that the devil who urged me to my revenge, brings home to me the poison which I distilled for others! My sister, she is pure, what harm has she done?' But Isabel? Ho, ho! Sir Monk, thou hast forgotten the beautiful and sinless girl of the prairie? `I will save her! So aid me God and all his saints!' With that trembling vow upon his lips, he rushed down the stairway, and found himself in the darkness of Isora's chamber. The door, he tried it, with the nervous force of despair, but it is fastened, and the echo of voices came through its thick panels! He listened!—the voice of Isora, Don Augustin and the Avenger, mingling in chorus. Again the monk, driven to frenzy, tried the door, but his attempt was hopeless. He sank back upon the bed of Isora, and a hand, cold, clammy, was laid upon his own, thrilling his veins, as with the touch of the dead. `Fear not, Don Antonie,' said a soft, mild voice, `for I, Isabel, of Prairie Eden am with you!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. THE THREADS OF DESTINY. `It matters not how brave, how ferocious the criminal may be when in the act of his crime, let but Destiny weave its tnreads about him and the hero of vengeance came and lo! your criminal is but a child in strength and an ldiot in intellect. —Texan MSS. At the same moment, on the opposite side of the door, in the gloomy chamber, frowning with the portaits of Castilian hidalgos, Don Augustin maddened by blind rage, stood prepared to plunge his sword into the heart of his unknown enemy. That enemy stood near the door, his arms folded over his rifle, while a smile of cold contempt played over his lips. Kneeling by his side, the light held in her extended arm—it seemed frozen into marble, lsora wound the dark robe around her breast, and looked with vacant terror into the face of her betrothed husband. Her bosom now stilled like death, now heaving suddenly under the dark robe, her rich olive chek, chilled into a dull, lifeless hue, her eyes gleamng a light at once vivid and unnatural—all betokened the violence of the emotions which threatened her reason with utter annihilation. Indeed she seemed sinking fast into a stupor, a dull apathy worse than death. Calm and sneering, John Grywin—his cold smile rendered sinister, aye, Satanic, by the upward direction of the light—looked into the face of Don Augustin, as though he would read his soul, through his small and restless eyes. `Heretic! never do you leave this room alive! Yon have poisoned the mind of this pure lady—pure! ha! ha! He laughed bitterly. `You have outraged the honor of a Mexican. Come,—I am hungry for your blood!' `You talk like a hero! Bravo! I really begin to admire you, Don Augustin.' Such was the reply of John Grywin, de livered in a quiet tone, his arms still folded about his rifle, Not a muscle of his face moved—not one sign of agitation was visible in his tall form or bold, white forehead. `Dog! coward! I spit on you!' Don Augustin grew grotesquely eloquent. `I say you are afraid to measure swords with me! I call you poltroom!—and scorn you.' `You are ungentlemanly, Don Augustin,' quietly remarked the Texan. `Now I have but one word to say, and that is to request the loan of your coat for a few hours. I wish to pass the guard at the Mole, and to pass in your uniform; you understand? Will you strip?' There was a sneering consciousness of superior power, not only physical but intellectual force, in his look and tone, and yet Don Augustin was not a man at all to be despised. With an impetuous bound he hurled the point of his sword at the unprotected beast of the Texan. It was a deadly lunge, a moment of quivering suspense. Then occurred a sudden and sublime sacrifice. This woman, Isora, kneeling on the floor, the light extended in her palsied hand, was only clad in the solitary robe which trembled on her heart. Yet she did not remember this nor call to mind that modesty which is the most sudden instinct of a pure woman. There was a wilder instinct in her breast; call it fascination, magnetism, love; and it taught her that the sharp point was hurled against the Texan's heart, that she must save him at every hazard. Quick as the tigress, maddened by the slaughter of her young, she darted from the floor, raised the light in one hand, and with the other flung the robe from her breast and hurled it upon the point of Don Augustin's sword. Then panting and glowing—her form brave as the form of sinless Eve, she flung back her head, and with the eye flashing, the nostril quivering, she entangled the sword, and with a sudden movement, hurled it and her robe together, on the floor. The light was still in her uplifted left arm, and in its beams she stood revealed, glowing from head to foot, on bosom, cheek and brow, with the fiery impulse of that heroic deed. Don Augustin started back and shrieked her name, coupled with a word too foul for manhood to repeat. Maddened as the Texan was by the wrongs which had goaded him for years, until his very life became one brooding revenge he felt his blood boil at that unmanly word. Look! You see his clubbed rifle circle his head, you see Don Augustin hurled senseless to the floor. Then the beautiful girl, roused once more into her woman's modesty as the impulse of her action passed away, blushed in every pore, tossed her dark hair on her form; it fell it waved, it streamed over her bosom and down her limbs, and sinking on her knees wept aloud. Methinks I see some sensualist of the Pulpit or the press read this passage, and as his foul imagination, ineapable of anything but that which is born of the kennel of his own heart, covers this heroic deed with the atmosphere of his sensualism, and gravely groans `Immoral! Damnable!' I write this scene, first of all because it is true, and next, as a defiance to those poor earth worms, who crawl over all that is pure and beautiful in the earth of God, leaving their slime wherever they writhe along. I paint this woman, with the bared form, and look upon her unveiled loveliness, blooming in such roseate hues, flowing in such waving outlines, as a type of all that is pure in the wide earth, an incarnation of that love which hallows a man's soul, when he thinks of a mother or a sister, a love stainless as the snow-flake trembling from the parent cloud, and bathed as its floats in the ray of a setting sun. But the sensualist, whether he whines in the pulpit, or croaks in the press, or howls in the brothel, what message has the statue or the picture, or the wood-painting, which embodies a woman's unveiled form, what message has this purity enshrined for him? Nothing but earth, for he is of the earth, earthy; nothing but filth, for he is born of filthy; nothing but lust, for the impulses of his heart are like the bubble on the Dead Sea, stagnant and pestilent excretions fomenting on the very dregs of rottenness and decay. Such a sensualist have I seen, talk with prim utterance, in his demure journal, about immoral books; quoting garbled passages to prove his point, claiming sympathy from the moral public, because he had slimed over some sentence or chapter that was pure before he touched it; and all the while the victim of this chaste editor's perjury—a brokenhearted and wronged woman, lay mad and howling in the cell of an insane hospital.— This was a moral editor of a Moral Newspaper. An expression of mingled character passed over the Texan's face, as he gazed upon the kneeling girl. His large eye dilated, and flashed with unusual light, while a smile played over his lip. Veiled in her luxuriant hair, the snowy skin gleaming through the interval of her tresses, she still grasped the light, as her tears fell like rain on the half-revealed bosom. `Come, Isora,' said John of Prairie Eden —and believe me, his voice was low and deep, and thrilling with that music of passion which always steals to the heart, and makes it beat more tumultuously,—`we must away! Assume this monkish gown and wind the dark robe over it, while I put on the handsome dress of Don Augustin. Or stay! your purpose is changed; you will not fly with me and share the fate of the outcast and the stranger!' Isora raised her eyes. John was standing with his head drooped, his hands clasped, his wild and singular face mellowed by a shade of overwhelming sadness. The strong man seemed melted into very womanhood as he talked to himself—it was his manner when wrung to the heart by sudden emotion. `Outcast! Yes, I have no home, nor father, brother, sister—not one friend on the wide earth of God! Poor Harry! I see your boyish face and clear blue eyes—your voice, O Harry, how it comes back to my soul!— And in cold blood they put you to death. I saw you—yes, now I see your face dabbled in blood, a smile quivering on your lips, and they are cold forever! Isabel, dishonored— dishonored! The father hanging before the porch of his own home; his ashy face glowing in morning sun! Isora deserts me too! Isora—this dear flower which I found blooming in her Mexican home, and wound to my heart—Isora leaves the outcast to his fate!' No wonder that voice, whispering its wild soliloquy, pierced the maiden's soul. She rose from the floor, and winding the robe once more upon her form, laid her right hand upon his muscular chest, while her eyes, shining through the intervals of her hair, burned with emotion too deep for words. Their eyes met; the maiden seemed to grow into his heart, even as their glances mingled in one; a rosy red stole over her cheeks and bloomed in dewy freshness on her parted lips. `I have no home but with thee!' She did not tell how he had won her heart, how, appearing at first in her lonely home, with an atmosphere of mystery and romance about him—he had besought shelter from his pursuers. This was many days ago. She listened to his story, won by the melody of his voice, the strange light of his eyes, but more than all by that absorbing story, which spoke of the dear Prairie Eden, cirled by the trees of the Island Grove; the gentle brother Harry, the dead father and the beautiful Isabel. From that hour she loved him, and many a time, in the gloomy chambers of the mansion, secluded from her brother's eye, and from the gaze of the Argus-eyed Duenna, this young and passionate woman suffered her unknown lover to kneel at her feet, to thread his fingers in the masses of her silken hair, and looked the magnetism of his soul into her eyes. She did not tell him in words this story of her love, but it shone in her eyes, it spoke in the brief sentence, uttered with dewy lips and panting bosom. `I have no home but with thee!' Let us pass once more into the shadows of Isora's bed chamber, where the monk shrinks back from the touch of a death-cold hand, as he hears the well-remembered voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. THE VOICE OF ISABEL. `How like a voice from the dead comes up that voice of the wronged and dishonored, speaking through silence and darkness to the heart of the wronger. —Texan MSS. `Fear not, Don Antonio, for I Isabel, of Prairie Eden am with you!' The chamber was dark, and that voice, breaking suddenly from the gloom, sounds like hollow accents from the lips of death. `It is her ghost,' groaned the miserable man, as remorse began to rend every fibre of his soul. `From the shadows of the grave she comes to haunt me.' `Not Isabel the ghost, but Isabel, the living, blooming—fair as when she won your heart at Prairie Eden.' The cold hand pressed close within her own, and thrilled its ice to his heart. `Nay; shrink not from me, Don Antonio. You loved me with an idolatry so wild, so mad! Loved me even when my father hung writhing on the tree, before his porch, his last groan gurgling up to God, as your kiss was on my lips. Long years have passed since then, Don Antonio; would you like to look upon my face once more? Or do you fear to behold those eyes which once filled your soul —those lips which once clung to yours, when the heart was maddened by a foul drug—the soul lost in the dreams of opium?' Don Antonio started from the couch and struggled nervously to free himself from the grasp of the cold hand. But it held him as with the clutch of an iron vice, and the cold fingers seemed like the bony hands of a skeleton. `Would'st like to look upon my face, Don Antonio?' Not a word from the lips of the trembling man. Alone, in that dark room, with a woman, who had come from her grave to haunt him, he grew icy cold and heard his heart throb like a death-watch. Yet he was a brave man, and had done a butcher's work on human forms in many a battle. All the while the sound of voices, in the next chamber, came indistinctly to his ears, and added to his frenzy; for he was frenzied now, cold and hot by turns, now burning with fever and now chilled into ice. Suddenly all was still in the adjoining chamber, and Don Antonio felt the cold hand and heard the voice again. `Come, you shall look upon my face!' The door swung open; Don Antonio had missed it in his nervous phrenzy, and the cold hand let the shuddering man into the next chamber. `Holy Trinity! It is the novice, Brother Paulo.' Retreating with a shudder, Don Antonio beheld, in the center of the chamber, the form of a monk, whose dark cowl was thrown over hts head and face, suffering only a glimpse of the features to be visible. The lamp stood on the floor, and flung its upward rays over that dark, motionless form with the marble-white hands appearing from the folds of the shapeless robe. Around were the pictured walls of that desolate room, the grim portraits and tapestry that flapped again the stone which it concealed, with a slow and hollow sound. John of Prairie Eden, Isora, and the brave Don Augustin—all were gone from that gloomy chamber. The cowled figure and Don Antonio were alone in the silence and shadow. `Yes, it is the novice,' said the well-remembered voice from the shadow of the cowl. `The novice who three months ago entered the monastery of San Francisco, as a lay brother, and soon became the secretary of the reverend monk, Father Pedro. You have never seen this face, good father,—at least, never in a cowl—never since the night. Oh you remember it?—the night of Praire Eden!' Don Antonio, even with his shaven crown and cheek, was by no means an unhandsome man. His dark, olive features, the boldly chisselled nose, the ponderous brow, over-arching large and lustrous eyes; the mouth, around whose lips scorn and love, and the power of a dauntless will, played by turns— all resembled some antique head! moulded in rich bronze. He was, we say, by no means an unhandsome man; his springy step, his graceful form, the monkish robe could not altogether hide. But now he was hideous, livid in the face, and stricken down as by a pestilence in every trembling limb; a fear, a horror worse than death possessed his veins; for before him, in the cowled form of the novice, or neophyte, Paulo, who had glided by his side for the last three months, he beheld not a living shape, but a ghostly image from the regions of the dead, sent to haunt his perjured soul. Falling on his knees he crossed his brow and cried to God for mercy! The neophyte raised that marble-white hand; in a moment the cowl would fall from the face. Don Antonio dared not turn his eyes away, and yet shuddered as he anticipated the disclosure of the ghastly features of the dead. The cowl fell—O, what a ghastly vision broke on Don Antonio then! That face, whiter than alapaster, with the delicate veins traced on the colorless brow, and a single spot, deep red, burning like a flame on each cheek; those lips, pale vermillion, moving without a sound; the eyes, unnaturally large, spreading with their strange light from the brow to the cheek-bone, and shining with an unfaltering glare upon the kneeling monk. Around this deathly face, like a crown of ebony, was a mass of jet black hair, making the pale features yet more pale, and giving additional fire to the glaring eyes. There are no words in language to picture the sad reproach, the overwhelming melancholy of that face. Around it, like a veil, seemed to hang the very atmosphere of despair. `You think it sadly changed, Don Antonio, that face, which once won your love? Yet we are all changed, Father Pedro! Five years ago you were the handsome cavalier, pressing the drugged goblet to the lips of a weak girl, who sank at your feet, her soul wrung in every fibre, her brain whirling in madness. Now, you are the monk; and before you stands the girl whom you dishonored, while her brother bears your sinless sister away to his bridal chamber. Bridal chamber —a sweet word, father!—bridal chamber!— without one priestly rite or marriage vow—a meaning word, Father Pedro.' She raised herself erect, in all the pride of her fallen majesty, and stretched forth her white hand, as though she scattered the ashes of her curse upon his brow. It was pitiable to see the agony of the monk, whose heart seemed crushed by his remorse. `Holy Trinity! My sister—pure and stainless—what hath she done to merit this wrong.' `She is guilty even as Isabel of Prairie Eden—guilty of her innocence and beauty.' It was now the moment, when the cup of Don Antonio's degradation filled even to the brim. Before the woman, whom he had wronged five years ago—basely wronged, with an outrage that has no forgiveness, this side the grave, no revenge save the outpouring of blood—this proud man now grovelled like a slave beneath the lash; yes, like a hound beneath his master's scourge. `Lady! be you a living woman, or be you a spirit from the grave, listen for a moment before you pour the last drop into this bitter cup. I confess my crimes, my baseness. I acknowledge this on my knees, thus crouching at your feet! I murdered the father—the daughter I dishonored—the brother I put to death, even as he begged for a crust, for a drop of water. No tears, no prayers, not one writhing of my victim's soul swayed me aside from my course! Can I confess more? Yet my sister—in the name of God and his angels, do not suffer wrong to visit her, and of all wrongs, that outrage which has no baptism of redemption but blood. For she is pure, she is innocent! Take my life, but do not, O—listen to me—do not harm this child whom my dying father bequeathed to my care!' Cold and calm the cowled woman listened to his prayer. Not one feature in her marble face indicated emotion; her lip was firm, her eye unfaltering in its withering scorn. There was no answer from her lips, but the monk read it in that silent vengeance of the pale, beautiful face. Bowing his head on his hands, the cowl dropped over his face, and a silence ensued, unbroken by a sound. At last it was broken by the echo of a footstep, and a half-clad figure rushed wildly into the room. It was Don Augustin, his face red with frenzy; stained on the brow with a hideous wound; his form divested of his handsome coat of green and gold. You linger here—you!—shame! Has the monk robbed you of all that belongs to the soldier, to the man? You linger here, and the accursed heretic has borne your sister away, passed the guard, disguised in my coat, and now, perchance—but what mummery have we here?' For the first time he beheld the disguised woman. `Don Augustin,'—the voice of the monk was husky as he raised his livid face—`in that cowled form you behold my fate—the destiny of my house—the woman whose honor I crushed without remorse, five years ago, in her home of Prairie Eden!' The small, ferret eyes of the Mexican twinkled with rage. `Can I believe my eyes? Is it Don Antonio Marin whom I see kneeling here? Arise, be a man? Let us pursue the heretic! there is a boat by the mole; we will pass through the American fleet and track the robber to his den in the Isle of Sacrificios. It is a work of danger, I know—you are afraid—afraid! when the honor of the home of your father is at stake!' He paced the floor, rubbing his hands together, as he cursed some dozen excellent oaths in pure Spanish. `Come, I will go with you I'—and Don Antonio sprang to his feet—`but who will lead us to the den of the heretic?' A low, sad voice, unbroken by a tremor, was heard echoing far along the gloomy chamber,— `That will I!' And Isabel, with her pale face turned to the light, her full eyes fixed upon her betrayer, pointed with her white hand toward the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. THE ISLE OF THE SACRIFICE. `Near Vera Cruz, in the Isle of Sacrificios— where the Aztecs offered the sacrifice of human blood—subterranean chambers have been discovered and images of the forgotten religion, with the altar stone on which the victim was slain. —Texan MSS. The Isle of the sacrifice!' We stand upon its sandy shore, with the dark waves, breaking in low murmurs all around us, the deep night gleaming upon us from the dark dome, overspread with stars, San Juan's castle frowning over the waters, and white Orizaba lowering from afar into the great temple of the midnight universe. A strange isle, with its rocks, and sands, and scattered herbage, stretches before us.— Three hundred years ago the altar of sacrifice smoked with his blood-red incense here, and the groans of the victims echod far over the waters, as the anointed priest of the faith of Murder, tore from the mangled breast the quivering heart. Even now, beneath this soil, strange chambers lie hidden, stored with the gods and altars of the Aztec faith. Still, from yonder shore, echoes the tramp of armed men, and through the night the sails of the American ships gleam like white mists, hovering over the waters. Suddenly a half-naked form springs from the waves and stands erect upon the sand.— By the dim light of the stars you may discern the iron outline of that figure, with loose trowsers clothing it below the waist, while the sinewy arms, the firm, broad chest, are bared to the night breeze. Had you but one gleam of light you would behold the flesh along the back severed with many a hideous welt, mangled into one clotted mass of sores and blood. This unknown man, springing from the waters without one sound or word to warn us of his approach, shakes his huge arms in the air, and with clenched hands and groaning utterance, disturbs the silence with words like these,— `By— I am free! You shall not scourge my back again, nor dig your lash into my flesh once more, though I am but a common sailor in the American Navy! By — I would sell my soul to the devil, could I but have the brave captain of the — here, on this barren shore for five minutes—only five minutes! Curses upon that flag,curses upon its stripes and stars! The stripes for the common sailor's back—the stars for every petty tyrant who may buy a commission by crawling round the avenues of the city of Washington. I swear as God sees me, to hate and fight against that flag forever! May the devil catch me this minute if I would not like to have it here, and grind it into the sand beneath my feet.' The escaped sailor turned from the waves and steadfastly fixed his eyes upon the barren isle. “Twenty paces from the shore, a small rock of peculiar shape rises from the sand.— Near Ihat rock your freedom awaits you.'— What can it mean? To-night, as I lay in my irons, a paper was pressed into my hand by a strange man, who whispered, `take this file—read the paper—and swim to Sacrificios —I am here, but where's the rock?' Even as he spoke there rose at his feet a small rock, triangular in shape, with its surface covered with uncouth figures, discernible by the light of the stars. He examined the rock with a careful and searching scrutiny. All was silent around: no trace of a human form was visible. `I'm prettily fooled!' growled the escaped sailor with an oath; `but it's my only chance —here goes.' With a strong effort he raised the rock from the sand, or to speak more correctly, lifted it on one end, and a warm light, streaming from a square aperture at his feet, bathed his face, with a ruddy glow. Then it might be seen that his hair and beard were alike fiery red in hue, his face embrowned by the sun and rain, his eyes bleared and swollen, his teeth revealed by his parting lips—black, broken and irregular—altogether a hideous visage. At his feet, as from a well, streamed that hidden light, disclosing a rude ladder, whose top rested against the side of the aperture. In an instant his huge form was concealed in the passage, and with his brawny arms he drew the rock back to its original position and descended the ladder. Even steps he counted, and turning his head over his shoulder, saw that he had entered a small room or cavern, with a blazing pine-knot attached to its rocky wall. In that light, like the crude horrors of some nightmare dream, he beheld the details of the place. Three obscene idols, formed of porphyritic rock, and six feet in height, supported the ceiling of the cavern. Between these idols, three black spaces appeared, evidently passages, leading deeper down into the subterranean chambers of the Isle of Sacrifice. On the wall, near the eastern idol, the pine-knot was hung; by its light the sailor read the crumpled paper which he drew from his trowser's pocket. `To-day you were lashed like a dog, your flesh peeled from your bones, at the command of a petty tyrant. Would you be free? Tonight a file will be placed in your grasp, and with it directions which will enable you to seek the company of a jovial band who acknowledge no lord nor master, save The Chief of the Free Rangers. Isle of Sacrificios, March 9th, 1847. It was an interesting thing to observe the face and form of this escaped sailor, while he stood by the torch, engaged in deciphering the somewhat mysterious epistle which we have given above. The light streamed over his red hair and beard, disclosing the sinews of his gigantic chest, and revealing his broad back, with the blood oozing slowly from its welts and sores. At first his countenance wore a gloomy scowl,— `I have been fooled,' he murmured, with a blasphemous oath, and tossed the paper to the ground. `Ha! what is this?' he cried, as he beheld a piece of paper, some ten inches square, affixed to the wall by a knife,—“Beyond the eastern idol lies your way; pursue it in darkness for some hundred paces, descend a stairway, and await further orders from the C. F. R.' Without a second thought, the sailor passed beyond the eastern idol, and measuring his paces through the darkness—while a chill air swept against his cheek—soon came to the stairway, which he descended, and discovered a light shining around the angle of a rock, distant from where he stood not more than ten yards. He soon reached the rock, and started back with a shout of wonder mingled with delight. The rock, a huge and irregular crag, with a similar crag opposite, formed the doorway to a chamber some twenty feet square, in the centre of which stood a table, stored with the most luscious fruit and viands, mingled with flasks of wine. This much, at a glance, the escaped sailor beheld, but entering the chamber he examined its minutest details with something of a cold shudder thrilling every nerve. For around that table, with a chair at either end, and spread as if for a banquet, were grouped the most hideous forms of the ancient Aztec theology, sculptured in every variety of ugliness, and looking altogether, with their uncouth shapes, stony eyes and distorted features, like the attendant devils of some infernal festival. The light in the centre of the table, standing amid fig and oranges, grapes and flowers, imparted a ruddy warmth to the prominent points of the idols, while everything beside was wrapped in misty gloom. `A devilish queer company,' cried the sailor as he flung himself in a chair; `but the wine bottles look tempting, and the cold ham is not to be `sneezed at'—particularly by a common sailor, who has not tasted food for twelve hours! Ha! champaigne, as I'm a sinner—pop! How the sound of that cork makes them stare—these respectable gentlemen, with the stony eyes and peculiarly ugly faces. A slice of ham, a biscuit, and another pull at the champaigne bottle. I feel quite comfortable, by —' It would require the pencil of some artist who delights in the grotesque and horrible to picture this scene. Relieved by the dark background, the burly face of the sailor, framed in red hair and beard, stood boldly out in the light. In one hand a champaigne bottle, in the other a slice of ham inserted between two biscuits. His huge form is comfortably disposed in the arm chair, and his broad chest begins to swell and heave with the fiery impulse of the wine. Above, the rocky ceiling, and around the table those distorted forms and uncouth faces, looking like living things as the light flit to and fro over the dusky outlines. One figure towers above the rest; a dim shape of dark-red stone, with a knife of obsidian, or volcanic glass, extended in its deformed right arm. It is the Aztec war-god, Mexitili. And here, where the priests of the forgotten creed administered their bloody rites 300 years ago, now sits the escaped slave of the American Navy making merry, with the wine bottle in his hand, while his roystering catch is echoed far along the gloomy recesses of the cavern. It was a strange song that he sung, and seemed to have some bearing upon a murder done at sea by a captain of the American Navy,— `They hung at the yard-arm, swing so gay, Their feet in the air, their faces to heaven. The Captain wiped his lips, and said,—`Let us pray!' And then three cheers for God were given. `The stars and stripes and the tyrant's law!' Let us merrily, cheerily sing, For God let us now my boys hurah! As we merrily, cheerily sing.' With some dozen more doggrel verses of blasphemous tenor, the escaped sailor plyed the wine bottle until the Aztec gods seemed dancing round him and leering in his face with their stony eyes. Then crowning his brow with a wreath of blossoms snatched from the table, he gravely drank the health of the idols, one by one, terming them `all good fellows of the right stripe, though, d—n it! they needn't make such ugly faces.' The wine which he drank seemed not so much to cheer as to madden him. He felt it, burning like molten fire in every vein, and encircling his brain as with a mass of liquid light. Whether from his long fast or the peculiar effect of the wine, we cannot decide, but wherever he turned his head he saw the cold face of a dead man, who glared upon him, with eyes like glass, as his body hung suspended to an oaken limb. That quivering oaken limb, that cold white dead man's face was everywhere, now among the idol forms, now moving slowly overhead, now seen in the centre of the table, the limb always trembling, the face always white, dead and ghastly. Yet this sight did not strike the drunken sailor with anything like fear. He drank only the more, shouted the louder, and trolled as he danced around the table, his doggrel song, until the nooks and corners of the cavern-room seemed yelling on with the echo of a hundred voices. At last, whether it was a reality or but part of his drunken dream, we know not, but he suddenly became aware of the presence of a new guest, a tall man, dressed in deep black, a veil upon his face, shrouding his features from view, `Would you,' said a voice of full and manly intonation, `would you become one of us?' `That depends pretty much on who you are and what you follow.' And the drunkard staggered to the chair, endeavering to clear his eyes from the fiery mist which danced before them. `We are a band of brothers, who, gathering our taxes from the land sea, have turned this war to our own uses. We have gathered our members from the oppressed in the army and navy of the United States. We have a three-fold object—security, plunder and revenge—will you join us?' `I will, hoss!' cried the sailor, falling into the slang which he had acquired, years ago, in the prairies of the west. `Jist show me a chance now.' `But you are afraid to take our oath? You will shudder at the initiation of the Independent order of Free Rangers.' The sailor started to his feet, leaned over the table, and while his bloodshot eyes rolled in frenzy, grinned until his discolored teeth were visible, as he uttered an oath too horrible for repetition. `I don't care much what yer oath is; I'm a Royal Arch Curser myself—I am. And as to yer Initiation, tell me, what kin a man fear who has been lashed like a dog on board a free American ship of war? Show me a chance I say, and let me but stand free to face with the captain of the —; only for a minute—O, only for a minute!' `Wait here, and in one hour you will be summoned by a brother of our order. He will lead you to the altar, where your courage will be tried; for as our lives will hang upon your fidelity, it is important that we know what manner of man you are before we admit you into our brotherhood. Remember—in half an hour prepare.' The figure in black disappeared behind the image of the war god, Mexitili. Half an hour passed away. The cavern no lodger rang with shouts of boisterous merriment; the viands were no longer eagerly devoured, nor the bottles emptied with mad rapidity. Along the table, heaped in inextricable confusion, were scattered wreaths of blossoms, slices of ham. biscuits, bottles, oranges, figs and flowers; but the drunken sailor, who with the print of the Free American Lash on his back, reeled here an hour ago, singing blasphemous songs, where is he now. In the arm chair at the head of the table behold him, his shock red hair and beard presenting a frightful contrast to his face, which is now as pale as a corse. He is a very strong man, and yet now he trembles from head to foot, his bloodshot eyes neither turn to the right or left but glare fixedly before him. Why this paleness, this trembling, this unknown fear? A deep groan is heard. `I believe that my heart is burning to a cinder within me. My temple throbs as though the pendulum of a clock were enclosed in my skull. I cannot drink any more—I tremble; I am hot and cold by turns. Ah! who's there?—who's that repeating my name?' `Ewen McGregor!' called a voice from the recesses of the cavern; `do you still desire to enter the brotherhood?' `I do,' faltered the sailor. `Then come hither.' He arose, tottered along the cavern until the darkness enclosed him. A cold breeze swept against his cheek. There was a hand pressed upon his own—why did he turn cold as that hand touched his fingers? `Advance twenty steps with me. Take this knife and obey.' He took the knife and was led forward in the darkness until the folds of a curtain brushed his face. `Within the chamber, shrouded by this curtain, lies your victim, bound to the altar of the Aztec faith, as they bound their victims three hundred years ago. Do not fear—do not tremble, but think of the lashes you received this day, and, without lifting the veil which conceals the face, strike home. Enter and obey.' Why did the brain of the stout-hearted sailor suddenly feel as though all the blood in his Herculean frame had rushed into his skull? He grasped the knife and dashed the curtain aside.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. THE MONK BEHOLDS THE REVENGE. `It was a bitter drop in his cup, no doubt; but he had to drink it.' —Texan MSS. We will return to the chamber of the three idols. Not ten minutes had elapsed since Red Ewen the sailor left its confines, when three figures stood revealed by the light of its pine torch. Here Isabel, her pale face framed in the cowl, which increased the strange lustre of her eyes and made her features both spectral and ghostly; by her side, Don Augustin, his form shrouded in a dainty brown mantle, varied with silver trappings and glittering with a single jewelled star. Under the torch, his bronzed visage distinctly disclosed in every vein and nerve by the downcast rays, stood Father Pedro, otherwise called Don Antonio, clutching his hands in nervous intensity, as his livid lips trembled with a soundless motion. The cowled lady was calm and cold!— Don Augustin red-faced and fiery ubout the eyes. Don Antonio a picture of remorse, carved in black and bronze. Around them the obscene images seemed to live nnd move, as their forms were now darkened by a sudden shadow and now illumined by so ruddy a light. Don Augustin dashed the sheath of his sword against the hard floor of the cavern, in a gesture of extreme impatience. `Come!—the devil and all his imps seize this night and all its works'—he was choice in his cursing was Don Augustin—`we have lingered long enough, dared danger enough, good lady it is time for you to fulfill your promise. Lead us to the haunt of this Texan —heretic and pirate as he is, and we will force the lady Isora from his grasp.' `My sister! as my father poured forth his blood at my feet he consigned thee to my care!' murmured the monk. `The brother alone may thread these passages with me,' broke in the sad tones of the cowled Isabel, `Father Pedro alone may rescue his sister. Nay, scowl not, Don Augustin, nor curl your lip with scorn—it must be so, or I will even leave the poor girl to her fate.' `Await here, Don Augustin,' hurriedly exclaimed Father Pedro. `I will track these solitudes alone; if I do not return within an hour, follow and avenge.' Why that smile on the pale red lips of Isabel, as she surveys their parting embrace— the cheek of the monk laid against the face of the soldier—the firm clasp of each other's hands and the meaning glance of their eyes. `I will await you—if need be, avenge you,' Don Augustin laid the paint of his sword to his lips. `Come!—your sister calls you.' And Isabel led the way into the darkness beyond the western idol. Saw you that pale face turned to the light, the moment ere it disappeared, the eyes and the lips wearing the same expression, cold, relentless, ghostly? Now came the moment of Don Antonio's triumph. Through these dark passages, where the air was hot and stifling and chilled with subterranean draughts by turns; down these rude stairways, hewn three centuries, aye,— perchance ten centuries ago, in the solid rock —up these rugged ascents where the footstep became unsteady as it encountered the stony fragments flung over the dark path; on and on, in darkness, the monk followed his silent guide. The darkness was dense, palpable, it seemed to shut him in like the boards of a coffin; the silence was dead and appalling, unbroken save by the echo of their footsteps. Isabel was silent; for a quarter of an hour no word passed her lips, but her cold hand was damp with a clammy moisture that chilled the hand of Don Antonio throughout every nerve. How the consciousness that he was alone with the woman whom he had so foully wronged, pressed like a sentence of Death on his soul! Still, in all the wilderness of his baseness and crime, there bloomed one beautiful flower —more lonely from the very blackness that encircled it—the love of a pure and stainless sister. At last—oh, how gladly—with what an involuntary cry of delight he beheld it—a light shone from afar over the darkness of their way. Isabel spoke for the first time,— `That light shines on your sister's face!' The word touched Don Antonio's heart with new life. `On, on!'—he shuddered—`it may be too late.' Nearer and larger grew that light until it resembled a sun, so round, and full, and blazing it broke upon their eyes, an unearthly sun glancing over the darkness of these Aztec vaults. Why linger on each moment of stifling suspense? At last they stood near the light. It shone out upon the rock bound passage, from a circular space, framed by rocks and lighted up the roof, the floor, the walls of this lone corridor, with a red, glaring glow. `The passage ends here,' whispered Isabel. `That light shines from a chamber, from which we are separated by a solid wall of rock.' `Let us enter the chamber; my sister is there,' gasped the monk. `Your sister, indeed, is there, but you cannot enter the chamber, unless you retrace your steps, and from the chamber of the three Idols depart by the eastern passage. It may be well for you to do this, but first advance, and through this crevice behold your sister.' Don Antonio saw her look—saw her face lighted for a moment by a smile—oh, how wild and unearthly—and was afraid to advance. He feared to behold the secret of that unknown chamber. She took him by the hand and dragged him to the sperture in the solid wall of rocks. This was the sight which he saw:— A small room, circular in form, whose wall was formed by one undulating curtain of faint crimson, which was supported by three slender white pillars. From the celing—it was like a dome, and painted to resemble a midnight sky: blue, spotted with stars—hung a fiery globe which bathed the place in dazzling light. This light, which seemed to float and wave in waves of liquid flame, was tempered and softened by clouds of snowy incense smoke, which emerged from the thousand apertures of the globe, and wrapped the room in intoxicating odors. Beneath the globe, in the centre of the rich matting which supplied the place of a carpet, was a cushion or couch of rich scarlet velvet, fringed with gold; and near it a sofa or divan of the same rich tevture. On the sofa, half seated and half reclined, was a man of some twenty-five years, he did not seem more; his dark hair and beard, curled and perfumed, after the manner of the luxurious Sybarites of old. His broad chest heaved beneath a garment of purple velvet, flashing with gold and jewels. Fine linen about his bold throat, and around his bronzed hands; a broad belt of rich embroidery across his chest; a dagger quivering by his side. His face glowed; it shone in every feature with a mad delight. It was a face that could not easily be forgotten. Behold that downcast head, those large eyes, whose intense gaze grows soft with moisture, those parted lips, which seem unclosed in the act of murmuring words of passion. His right arm was extended, it held aloft a golden goblet, curiously carved and brimming with deep purple wine. But there was a fair hand laid upon the wrist of that extended arm. Well might Don Antonio gasp for breath! A woman's form was couched upon the velvet cushion, her head resting upon the knee of the man, as with an intoxicating langor stealing over her face she gazed upward through the intervals of her soft, silken hair, and lifted her arm, clutching his wrist as if to seize the goblet. She was clad in an azure tunic, or loose frock, which fell, without a girdle, from her shoulders to her knees, revealing by the soft gradations of every fold, the gentlest undulations of her shape. Below the knees her limbs were bare, their snowy whiteness contrasting with the scarlet rubiness of the cushion; a delicate sandal of pink satin was bound to the sole of each foot, leaving all beside, in its unveiled loveliness, the delicate azure veins, perceptible beneath the softly flushed carmine skin. A diamond sparkled on the tunic, where it half and only half concealed her bust; it sparkled with every pulse of her bosom, shone as that bosom rose, and glittered softly like a fading star as it fell. No more beautiful, no more delicate contrast can be imagined, than that which was presented by the soft whiteness of her half revealed shoulders, and the mazes of her silken hair, as black as a pall. One tress fell over her rising bosom, as i in shame, and veiled it as it heaved, like a creamy billow, into light. The face told the full story of that mad intoxication which thrilled every nerve of this beautiful girl—this Sultana of the rock-bound bower. Through the lips—they were slightly parted—glowing with moist vermillion, gleamed the ivory teeth. Over the cheek, soft, rounded, downy, burned a rose-bud flush, which now contracted in one intense heat of passion and again seemed to spread forth its rosy leaves over the whole face, The eyes, bright and dewy, and shining languidly from the heavy lids, which seemed weighed down by the intoxicating ordors of the place, were centered upon the face, glowering down upon that beautiful form with a glance not to be mistaken. `Wilt drink, Isora? Wilt drink to our merry life upon the broad ocean, where I, thy lover-husband, will gather spoil for thee—for thee—from every flag, and win diamonds for thy white brow from every clime? And after the battle is over, the good ship, with its royal Black Flag will tranquilly glide into the green cove of our island home. Thou wilt stand upon the shore, waving thy white arms as thy Rover comes up the steep cliffs, comes home to thee, covered with laurels and spoil! Drink Isora, to the days when we shall dwell on our island home!' She raises her white arms, the goblet is in her hand, its golden rim is pressed against her red lip, the purple wine glides slowly, in a rich, mellow current, through that quivering portal. `I love none but thee—thee only Juan!— Wherever thou goest, upon sea or shore, I will go with thee! In battle'—her slight nostril quivered—`I will bind on thy sword and laugh as the red mist waves over thee; in peace, when the fight is over, this bosom shall pillow thy head, as we sit at the porch of our island home and gaze upon the young moon rising over the waveless sea.' She twined her white arms upon his sinewy hands and dashed her silken hair over his arms. All the while her bosom, veiled by that solitary tress, rose like a creamy billow, bearing on its creast a dark and glossy burden. The incense smoke, agitated by a current of air, descended and swept over them like a veil. Don Antonio could not withdraw his gaze from the aperture. Oh, what fiend but would pity him now, as the crushing agony of his soul glares in his glassv eyeballs, and quivers in his parched lips. He cannot withdraw his gaze from the aperture; his eye is fixed upon the undulating veil of the incense smoke—he hears those kisses, those words of passionate transport, but cannot withdraw his gaze. Isabel—is she still cold and calm? Does no relenting throb pulsate in her ice-cold bosom? The light glaring around that passage revealed that motionless form, resembling a marble image of vengeance, veiled—all save the face—in a monkish cowl. Once, only, there was something like a burning tear upon her colorless cheek—a tremor on her lip. It was for an instant—she was marble again. Don Antonio turned, he seized her death-cold hands,— `Woman!' he fiercely shrieked, `have you no pity? Look! my sister, my only sister's senses drugged by maddening draughts—her honor torn from her in a moment of delirium. Pity—mercy—not for my sake, but for hers!' Isabel was silent; one word, after a pause, she gasped; one only, and that with an evident effort. `Prairie Eden!' The monk fell backward, as if blasted by a thunder stroke. But those sounds in the curtained chamber, those kisses of mad passion, those raptures of voluptuous transport— he heard them still, and was nerved with the savage strength of despair. `You must save my sister! By the Holy Trinity I swear your life shall pay the forfeit of her outraged honor. Your life! I swear it!—' He had grasped her wrists, and all the devil of his soul shone from his features, horribly distorted by passion, rage, madness. With but a single phrase she answered him,— `Rancho Salado!' The hands of the monk fell. He beat his forehead against the rocks, grappled the cold surface until his nails were splintered at the finger ends; and in the pauses of his phrenzy he shouted aloud her name—his sister's name,— `Isora!—'tis your brother who calls.— Isora, in the name of your dead father,— hear me!' The incense smoke waved aside, the monk looked through the aperture. `Oh God! this is worse than eternal death —she hears me not—kisses! His arms about her neck—the goblet! Isora! O shame—despair! Villain, I defy you—proclaim you coward—monster! Will meet you face to face in combat.—Isora!' And like the chorus to his broken ejaculations, was heard those whispering voices,— `Mine?' `Thine only!' `But my poor brother Harry, with his pale face and blue eyes, we'll drink to his memory —drink to him as he kneels in presence of his murderer, the prayer yet warm upon his lips, as he falls cold—cold—dead! Vengeance to the murderer of poor Harry!' `Give me the goblet. Thine eyes madden —thy voice whirls my soul as on a billow of flame. I drink, Juan—death and shame to the murderer of thy brother!' `Isora!' groaned—not shouted—the monk as he fell back from the fatal aperture in the rocks, his soul stupified by the voluptuous frenzy which burned his eyes as he beheld it! Isabel hears this, and does not relent? Ah, the cold, remorseless vengeance of the dishonored woman fail her at once. You see a vivid flash brighten over her face; she veils her eyes, beating the hard earth all the while with her tiny foot. `He murdered my father—I see his cold face—oh God! how it glares in the rising sun. Harry, too, went forth from home, and came back no more. There stands the murdered. My honor—that which is the world, heaven, life to a woman—he crushed into the dust, as the poisoned cup whirled its frenzy through my brain. I know it all—confess it my God; but his sister, she hath done no wrong; her ravings, uttered in the madness of passion, they madcen me. I can bear it no nger!' She turned aside from the glare of the light and her footsteps echoed along the caverned passage. The monk raised his eyes—she was gone. His despair was now complete. It was a horrible sight to see him tear the flesh from his face with his splintered nails. Suddenly three forms veiled in blue robes, appeared in the light, their faces lost to view in the folds of their garments. With one movement they seized Father Pedro, bound him despite his frantic resistance, and held their sharp knives at his bared throat. With the bandage across his mouth, the corns on his arms, these veiled forms lifted him to the aperture once more. He looked. Those who held him were thrilled with the cold shudder that pervaded his form. Once more! He lay motionless in their grasp, his proud spirit broken, his face changed and fallen, as though the ice of death had been poured upon it. `You have beheld only the beginning of justice as administered by the Free Rangers. Now comes the end!' Like an inanimate burden they bore the conscious but palsied monk into a dark passage which suddenly opened near the bright aperture in the wall. Whether it was a secret door or only a hollow in the rocks, which had evaded his search, he knew not, but suffered hem to bear him unresistingly along.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. RED EWEN IS INITIATED. `A singular rite was the initiation of the Free Rangers. A dead man was placed upon the Aztec altar and—' —Texan MSS. Red Ewen grasped the knife and pushed the curtain aside. It was a wondrous sight that met his gaze. He was a man of giant strength and superhuman nerve, infernal beyond the fancy of a devil in his remorseless cruelty, but within half an hour a strange coldness, succeeded by a burning senation, as sudden and as strange, had robbed his iron sinews of their vigor. The knife trembled in his grasp. He stood in a room, or cell, or vault, as you may please to term it, hollowed out of the living rock, not more than five yards in diameter. The floor was level, the ceiling shaped like a dome, but all was solid rock.— In the centre of the vault, a square form of stone arose, a block six feet long and three wide, with its sides sculptured into every variety of obscene or hideous hieroglyphic. At the head of the block—it resembled an ancient altar of sacrifice—towered a shape of brownish rock, veined with bright scarlet and re resenting in its ferocious eyes, embruted features and upraised war club, the Aztec god of war. Around the altar were grouped four living forms, clad in long robes, with a mantle falling over every face. The mantles were blue, the robes bright scarlet. From every robe was extended an arm grasping a lighted torch. Their mingling rays filled the vault with light and scented the air with grateful perfume. Red Ewen stood like a statue, dumb with amazement. To understand his feelings we must call to mind the incidents of his life, which took place upon this eventful 9th of March, 1847. This morning he writhed beneath the hang man's lash, on board a ship of war bearing the banner of the Stars. Only a few hours ago he lay in his chains, when a veiled man appear in the darkness, and taught him the way to freedom. An hour ago he danced in drunken madness in the Aztec banquetting chamber, his veins fired by something more than champaigne, some deadlier poison than the venom of alcohol. Now a change had come over him. The madness was gone. Cold, hot, fire, ice by turns, he stood under the door of this strange vault, knife in hand, and shuddered as he beheld the four veiled forms whose heaving breasts told that they were living, the solitary shape whose horrible deformity spoke of the dim ages, long since departed, when the quivering victim, a strong man full of life, was hewn to pieces in this very cell. One by one, the living figues addressed the escaped sailor,— `Could you become a Free Ranger, admitted to all the privileges of our Brotherhood?' `The right to spoil and slay, wherever a sure foot, a true steed, a good ship may bear you?' `To gather tribute from all nations, on land and sea alike, and select from the loveliest women of the earth the woman who you shall call wife so long as it may please you and no longer?' `A short life and a merry one! A life with the outcasts and oppressed of all nations, a jovial band, who know no laws save those proclaimed by their chief, who reward the traitor's deed with the sharpest knife and the strongest cord?' Then their voices joined in chorus,— `Would you, Ewen McGregor, escaped slave from the American Navy, become a free ranger of the land and sea?' `I would!' faltered Ewen, as the light played over his enormous chest and his broad back seamed with weltering stripes. With his brutal form and animal face, he stood in that vault likd the appropriate demon of the scene, his burly face, with blood-shot eyes and thick lips, disclosing black and broken teeth, encircled in his short, stiff, red hair and long, matted beard. His face was pale, his lip quivered as he uttered the response. `Then take the vow.' Far be it from me to repeat that eloquent liturgy of blasphemy. It was loathsome enough, horrible enough, in its crowded imprecations to satisfy the Demon of Blasphemy himself. Even Ewen shuddered, but that was with the fire and ice which possessed his veins by turns. `And if I fail in this to obey the commands of my leader, or betray the secrets of the Free Rangers, may the knife of the suicide sever my heart, may earth deny me a grave when I am dead, and the beasts feed on my senselass corse.' So ran the mildest part of the loathsome ritual. On his knees, before the altar, he took the oath, `to obey the commands of the Leader, whatever they might be,'—and knife in hand he rose. `Advance!' The voice sounded deep and hollow as it echod back from the dome. Red Ewen drew near the altar, his animal visage growing deathly pale. `Uncover the form of the dead!' At the word one of the figures robed in scarlet, his face mantled in blue, extended his hand and lifted the altar cloth, until a small space of flesh, evidently a glimpse of a human chest, on the left side, near the heart was visible, the veins distinctly marked beneath the clear olive skin. `Prepare for the last act of initiation! Behold this dead man—raise your knife and strike deep into his chest. Do this,—prove your defiance of all obligations, imposed by what pious fools denominate morality—prove that you fear nothing, either living or dead, and we hail you as a brother.' `Yet, I swear by — he lives!' faltered Ewen, as an indefinable fear palsied his arm. `Look—he is not dead—this man upon the stone—he breathes.' `Folly! your fancy deceives you—he is dead—aye, dead. He was a traitor, and he died according to our laws. Advance and strike.' The blood rushed to Red Ewen's face, filling every vein with the sudden and ferocious instinct of carnage. Each starting eyeball was filled with ejected blood; his thick lips became dark purple; he grasped the knife with all the vigor of his Herculean arm and came nearer to the altar. Still it seemed to move, that chest, concealed by the cloth, nay, the bared spot of brown flesh seemed to glow, as with the sudden impulse of strong emotion. True, the face of the dead man was veiled in the altar-cloth yet still the bosom seemed to quiver with life. Look—Ewen stands over the dead, the knife raised—it is ten inches long—the point poised over the bared flesh. A hissing sound—it descends—it is buried to the hilt in the breast of the dead man. There was a pause, while Ewen with his hand clutching the hilt, exerted all his strength to withdraw the blade, and in the action, he felt the body of the dead man writhe beneath him. At the same moment the altar-cloth was partly raised and the face disclosed. Ewen, the giant with an appetite for carnage like the tiger's, staggered from the altar as though the knife had pierced his own bosom, instead of the bosom of the dead. For that face was a fearful thing to look upon. The cloth bound around the jaws of the uncovered face did not conceal the horrible working of the features, nor hide the slow, rolling motion of the eyeballs, terribly bright with death, as they turned from side to side. A moan was indistinctly heard. `Don Antonio Marin!' shouted Red Ewen, as his veins seemed filled with an intolerable heat, and staggering back, he gazed stolidly upon the writhing features of the dying man. A figure dressed in blue and gold, stepped lightly over the entrance of the vault, and approached the altar. The torch light which shone over the contorted features of the dying—hark! that gurgling moan!—played upon the broad chest, the firm features of the intruder. `John of Prairie Eden!' shouted Ewen, as he stood rooted to the floor. `Hey! what's this! By the living — there is some plot in this! You here! Who lighted this vault with those hellish flames, and sent the devils dancing around that dying Spaniard? — Ah!' He fell, writhing in horrible convulsions, to the floor, the foam frothing round his lips as his fingers clutched the hard stone. By the altars's head, his brow uncovered, and his broad chest glowing with purple and flashing with diamonds, stood John of Prairis Eden, his features wearing a marble calmness, only disturbed by a slight movement of the nether lip. There was a Satanic beauty about his face, whose broad forehead, shaded by dark hair, firm, aquiline nose, compressed lips—appearing in the midst of his moustache and beard— and large eyes, deep sunken beneath arching brows, now wore an expression not the less infernal because it struggled with a look of quiet composure. He bent over the uncovered face of Don Antonio, and whispered—even as his beard touched the brow of the dying man—as his eyes, blazing with rapture, shot their glance into the starting eyesballs of the wretched victim—whispered in a soft voice, and with a pleasant smile, these words:— `When I withdraw the knife you will die, my friend. Hold, you will injure yourself if you attempt to speak again, for that bandage on your mouth makes it difficult for you to dreathe, much less speak. Be perfectly calm, my dear friend, for I have much to say to you ere you die. Do you know me? Do you know me? Do you recognise these features? Whom'—his breath swept the cheek of Don Antonio—`whom do I resemble, brother Harry—eh? Or do I look like my father? Or, hold—do you not trace a resemblance in my smile to the gay laugh of Isabel?' The cloth over the mouth was agitated by a convulsive motion, as the dying man made a horrible effort to speak. He knew the face. Look how his starting eyeballs glare into the eyes of his Doomsman! This scene seemed even to affect the forms in robes of scarlet with blue mantles over their faces. By the light of the torches which they grasped you can see their robes heave, as from the impulse of horror,—agony. On the floor, his giant form distorted into a shapeless heap of deformity—so horrible was the fire which gnawed his intestines— Red Ewen lay, the foam gathering in white beads upon his swollen lips, the white surface of his eyeballs suddenly turned to scarlet. `Oh, it was horrible'—he raved—`to force me to drink that goblet of melted lead, hot, hissing hot! It burns!—it burns! O, water —water! You have covered my brain with hot coals! Take your knee from my breast, old man of Prairie Eden; for you are a dead man; your eyes are cold—I hung you myself to the tree—' `That is Red Ewen's voice, my dear friend.' And John, smiling pleasantly, bent over the face of Don Antonio. `Do you know his voice? A pleasant voice! You heard it once in Prairie Eden, I am glad you know it. It was Red Ewen that stabbed you. Ungrateful dog, to turn his fangs against his master. My God!' he cried, with an air of chagrin, `this man is dying—he has not more than one minute's life in him, and I have so much to say to him. So many important things!' Look yonder, where the curtain hangs over the narrow entrance, and do not breathe lest you disturb the beautiful vision. A lovely face, with glossy black curls waving around it, appears amid those curtain folds; the eyes, dancing with wild light, gazing with wonder and fear upon the strange group of this cavern vault. It is Isora, whose brother, pinioned and gagged, the knife sunken to the hilt in his breast, lies writhing in death agony upon the altar. One movement of John—the mere change of his position, for a single inch to either side will reveal the horrible face of the dying brother to his sister's gaze. But John does not move—all good angels be thanked—there is a belt of shadow between the dying face and the lustrous eyes of the sister, `Ha!—that footstep! Isoro!' Without moving one inch, John turned his smiling face over his shoulder and whispered gently,— `My love, you have come. It is well, Remain where you are, for a moment only, beautiful Isora! How I love to linger on the music of that name—Isora!' The name rung through the vault in mellow cadence. She remained there, trembling on tip-toe, in the narrow entrance of the vault, her azure tunic relieved by the dark curtain which touched her shoulder as it fell; her snowy right arm raised upon her panting breast, and half mantled by her unbound hair. `Juan, I will stand here until you bid me enter.' How musical the low tones of that voluptuous woman's voice! It broke like a whisper from some blessed spirit upon the stillness of the vault, and right upon it an infernal chorus after angel music, clashed the howl of Ewen, writhing on the floor; the faint moan of Don Antonio gasping from the cloth that bound his mouth, He heard that voice, KNEW that his sister was there, almost within arm's length, and yet he could not speak to her, she could not see him. `Isora is here, my dear friend—Isora!'— He whispered in the very ear of Don Antonio —`would you like to speak to her? She loves me, the beautiful girl; and is mine—mine WITHOUT marriage! Are you perfectly sensible, Don Antonio? Have courage man, for you will need it. I am about to place the cloth over your face—it will never be lifted while you live. Never will you look upon a human face again. And you will die, with the voice of your own sister in your ears; that voice, which you love to hear, invoking vengeance on the murderer of the father and the brother; eternal vengeance on the betrayer of the sister.' It was horrible to see the effort of the dying man to unpinion his arms and make one intelligible sound through the thick cloth which bound his mouth. Once from side to side rolled his glassy eyeballs. John beheld and smiled. Once, the nerves of his face twitched like the nerves of a corpse agitated by galvanism; and then— John quietly placed the cloth upon his face and shut him from the light forever! Turning from the altar, his face beaming with a smile, he wound his arm around the lithe waist of the young girl, and led her genly forward. Did the dying man hear that tripping footstep? `Love—my own Isora!' He gaed his gaze upon her face, glowing so rosy red, on the lip and cheek, shooting such voluptuous languor from the eyes. `You know my wrongs —have heard me tell of the incarnate fiend who hung my father, in his grey hairs, to the felon's tree; who had no pity for poor Harry, though he knelt to him in the Plaza of Saltillo, and implored mercy with his blue eyes.— The fiend, Isora, who bought my sister's dishonor wlth the price of a father's life, and bade her rise from his arms that she might behold the dead face of that very father, glowing in the rising sun. Isora, you have heard it all!' `Juan, speak of it no more—no more! Woman as I am, weak and trembling, there is yet the blood of old Castile burning in my veins! I will roam the world with thee, Juan. Come —we will find this wretch, and will look upon his agonies while you avenge! Yes, I will pray God to nerve your arm, as you strike deep, exclaiming with every blow,—for my brother, for my father, for my sister!' Eye flashing, bosom panting, she laid her white arms upon his shoulder and looked up into his face. Did the dying man hear that voice. Look! the cloth on his breast quivers in the light. `You need not roam far, my love. Look! upon the altar lies the incarnate fiend, the remorseless destroyer of my race.' `There?—Let me look upon his face.' She started forward; John held her by the arms, but lightly, as though he hesitated; his dark eye perusing all the while the passionate warmth of her face. `No, Isora! You must not gaze upon him,' he said; `but hold.—Wretch, now quivering on the altar, I see your chest heaving with its last pang, and know that your moment is near. I ask you now, in this moment whose flight will leave you cold, would you like to look on a woman's face, and hear her beautiful lips curse you as you die? If your answer is `yes,' utter but the slightest moan and your face shall be uncovered.' The wretch moaned. Yes, rather than die thus in the dark, cut off from the sight of a human face forever, he would look upon his sister and hear her curse him as he died. Little did he imagine that this beautiful sister was unconscious of his presence; that she did not know him as the `incarnate fiend.' If there was one thought darker than another in his dying heart, it was the thought, `to be cursed by my own sister, the beloved of my heart, as I d e!' In that thought he felt, horribly felt, the full retribution for his crimes. `No! By the fiend whom you have served, you shall not look upon a human face again. Die in darkness, in the name of the father, the brother, and Isabel!' That movement of the altar-cloth. `This form upon the floor, Juan, it frightens me—this monster with the white foam on his lips?' `The accomplice of the fiend, who blindly struck the blow which killed his master, and now dies near him, his heart eaten by poison. Ewen, I say; do you know me? Champaigne is a glorious drink, but arsenic—ugh! Rise man, and die with some courage—only brute courage, if you will—don't writhe there like a dog.' The voice, thrilling in cold tones through the vault, seemed to rouse Ewen from his stupor. He rose heavily into a sitting posture and brushed his brawny hand across his bloodshot eyes; the whole scene seemed to undulate before him—the altar, the silent figures, the beautiful Isora and the calm, smiling John of Prairie Eden—all seemed to glide slowly to and fro. He brushed the white foam from his lips; it was evident that his hour was near, for his finger nails were blue, and the ruddy hue of his face began to deepen into purple. The change of death was on him. `John, I know you,' he gasped, as though every word was wrung from him by infernal tortures. `A bad man, John—I've been. In Philadelphia—my boy!—have mercy on him!' With those incoherent words, uttered with hands clutching each other, and bloodshot eyes rolling in death, he sank slowly into a shapeless heap on the floor. There was no groan—not even a gasp.— His purple face became black, his swollen lips the color of blueish clay, his broad chest was frecked with crimson spots. Not one quiver disturbed his sinewy form, nor did a single tremor announce that a spark of life yet lingered in his own muscles. He was dead—horribly distorted, and blackened, and swollen—dead as the rock upon which he laid. Why does that sudden paleness cross the face of the Avenger? Does his heart quail now? When he taunted the poisoned man, and bade him rise and die like a man, he anticipated a volume of curses from his foamy lips —he believed that Ewen would yell forth his last breath in blasphemies. But those incoherent words, uttered with his last breath, in the voice so very strangely softened and with a look of horrible entreaty, `My boy—in Philadelphia—have mercy on him!' John of Prairie Eden, so remorseless in his Satanic revenge, felt a sudden shudder pervade his form, a horrible gulf, black, fathomless, yawned before his eyes; he trembled and sank on his knees, his face buried in the bosom of Isora. Her soft hands played upon his forehead; her dark tresses waved over his shoulders.— He could feel her heart beating warmly on his cheek, but that voluptuous pulsation, could not still the prayer of the poisoned wretch which shrieked forever in the Avenger's ears—`in Philadelphia—my boy—have mercy on him.' The figures in blue and scarlet are motionless, the torches still burning in their extended hands; Ewen is blackened and dead upon the floor; Mexitili glares in horrible grotesqueness at the head ef the altar; John is kneeling, his head pillowed upon Isora's breast, and for the last time heaves the altar cloth, as a hollow sound, the death-rattle, echoes round the vault. Then over the threshold comes the form of a woman, clad in a monkish gown, her bosom panting, her breath trembling in gasps, her pale face flushed in every pore. You see her as she stands over the strange scene, her white hands clutching the robe to her breast, and her eyes—each pupil surrounded by a white circle—glare in silent agony from face to face. Her dark hair, gathered like an ebony crown around her brow—swollen in every vein with intense emotions—burst its cincture and waves in glossy tresses over her shoulder. Glossy and dark, and yet, amid its blackness, there are streaks of silver grey. Then to the altar advanced the miserable woman, whose life had been an ante-part of hell since the dark day when her honor was wrecked; she saw the clothed form on the al: tar and lifted the cloth from the face,— and— But there are emotions of the heart, agonies of the soul, which angels fear to behold, and devils dare not look upon, and we will drop the pall over the scene, over that sight which we cannot witness,— Isabel of Prairie Eden gazing upon the dead face of her betrayer!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. FROM VERA CRUZ TO PHILADELPHIA. `The vengeance was cemplete, but now came the turn of the Avenger. —Texan MSS. It was in the Walnut-street Theatre. I hear the snarl of the critic, and thus he barks,— `Here's a pretty transition—from the Aztec vault of Vera Cruz to a Philadelphia theatre! Horrible! Here we have a story commencing on the prairies of Texas, suddenly dashing away to a desolate rancho in the heart of Mexico, then to Vera Cruz and the vaults of Sacrificios, and last of all to a Philadelphia theatre!' This is truly horrible, and the author who is guilty of the deed, should be condemned to solitary confinement for one day, with a dozen critics, selected at random from the newspapers and magazines of the large cities. Such a punishment could make the warmest blood run cold. Just fancy it in all its details. One poor author among a dozen critics. Here a critic from Boston, brimming full of cant, breathing it, talking it, living in it—cant from head to foot, all cant. By his side, distinguished by a jockey eoat and dirty-brown mustache, a Cockney critic from New York, talking alternately of Progress and Pennies, wanting very much to know—in one breath—when the human race will take passage in the Progressional Steam Car for ths Millenium, and how much you will give him for a first-rate puff in his paper? Far in the corner of the cell where our author is confined, behold the magazine critic of Philadelphia; a jaunty thing, delicate in perfume, with oysterish eyes; the scissors in one hand and the scrap-book in the other.— A prim gentleman altogether, who pities our author in yellowish tears for—horrible!— being `popular with the many rather than the select.' That `many' the rouge, hardy people of the workshop and plough; that `select,' some dozen newspaper and magazine editors of Philadelphia, who hate each other most fraternally, and yet keep saying, all the year round to one another,—`you are a great man!' and `I am a great man!' and `we are all great men!' So, Allah Bishmallah, there is but one Literature; it is in Philadelphia, and Humbug is its prophet! Or yet; to go from small things to smaller, a critic south of Mason &amp; Dixon's line—a Baltimore critic. The drollest of all kinds of critics; the very friskiest of all kinds of insect, crawling and biting around the skirts of literature, and growing fat as it crawls and steals. Look at it; a critic, whose whitish hair, eyelashes and beard, and tallow complexion, all indicate a human thing, gone to seed, and sweltering in decay, long before it has enjoyed one moment of healthy ripeness. It publishes a large sheet, called soundingly, `the Universal Hemisphere,' and in the agonising effort to be witty or die, take some such slang name as `Major Tomkins,' an writes in bad spelling, bad grammar, and bad decency; all being very humorous and quite original. Imagine a poor author condemned to be crawled over and bitten, for one day only, by vulgarity and indecency, impersonified in a Major Tomkins, a Baltimore critic. My kind readers in the country, you will pardon me for this digession about critics, when I assure you that it was undertaken entirely for your good. Call this digression a preface to my story, if you please, and I will explain. You very often see a ferocious attack in some city perodical, which cuts into ribbons a book which you have been pleased to buy, read and love. You wonder at this, and perchance take the attack for an honest expression of prejudice, although you, of course, deny its fairness and truth. Your opinions would be somewhat modified were you aware that criticism is in the cities—pretty generally, and with some honorable exceptions—a mere matter of dollars and cents, a business contract between booksellers and critics—so much praise for so many pennies—an honorable understanding between those who sell books and who notice them; that genius is a thing made altogether of puffs, and that he who has most dollars can buy most puffs, and is, of course, the most extensive genius. You will pardon me if I have the smallest opinion of these magazine and newspaper critics, for in a circle of twelve, I have in my time seen one crittc who had forged another man's name; one who was a clergyman, and took his `brandy and water,' and was often led by his sympathies, with virtue, of course, into place better known than named; one who had issued counterfeit notes in his time, and finding this kind of paper rather unprofitable took to newspapers; one who had been convicted of swindling; and some three or four who divided among them the shattered fragments of the Decalogue, broken into pieces and trampled under foot. Rather a jovial band of moralists, this? These critics will be the first to attack my story and pronounce it a combination of improbabilities, when from first to last it is founded on published facts, which I have varied, to avoid the imputation of an unjustifiable personality. When they blow their blast, and snarl their snarl, you will understand at once what they mean. That I am either too poor to buy their praise with money, or that I have nothing of the Egyptian in me, never looking with favor on that creed which taught you to worship apes, lest they would do you a mischief; and go down on your knees to vipers lest they should bite you. It was in the Walnut-street theatre. Look over this thronged house, swarming from the ceiling to the cellar, with life—life in every shape—tapestried in its three tiers of boxes with human faces, a sea of ragged humanity boiling over in the pit—and tell me is it not a very solemn sight? Solemn! You laugh. Yes, solemn as the air of a grave vault and more impressive than the black skull of death. Look at the scene. Here, in the first circle, the most elegantly dressed men, the most beautiful women,— whose silken garments glow in the dazzling light, as their lovely faces are turned toward the stage; whose eyes outsparkle the jewels on their heaving breasts, and all the while, right before those sparkling eyes, in the over-flowing pit, you see the hardy sons of toil mingled with the ragged vagabonds of the good Quaker City. And all the while, in sight of those sparkling eyes, in full view of those grave mothers and beautiful wives and sinless sisters, you behold the third tier festering with the painted prostitution of the good Quaker City! Delicate contrasts these. What is the sight that enchains the gaze of the sinless girl and the painted outcast of shame? That rivets the eye of yonder white-haired man in the first tier and the ragged boy in the pit, right before him, within reach of his golden-headed cane? On what vision of moral or intellectual beauty is centered those thousand eyes, flashing and sparkling in the red gas light? A half-naked woman whirling over the stage, her form clothed in flesh-colored hose that clings to the skin, a piece of white gauze fluttering from her waist, her arms and bosom bare! A half-naked woman, whirling over the stage, now standing on one limb, while the other is poised in the air, on a line with her shoulder; now trembling along on tip-toe, as in the ecstacy of lascivious frenzy; now crouching near the foot-lights, her head bowed until her naked breast is revealed to the universal gaze—to the eyes of the sinless girl the painted outcast, the old man and the ragged boy. This is the sight which rivets the gaze of the crowded theatre.—a woman floating aleng the stage and trafficing her nakedness for bread. For her, the poor moth of the foot-lights, now fluttering in their glare only to be the more surely withered in ther blaze, there is some excuse. It is her livelihood—perchance the head of an aged mother, nay, the life of a sister, depends on her dancing limbs. Every twirl of her naked limb is one tear less on her dying sister's cheeks. But for these beautiful women, these grey-haired men, who, in the presence of the painted prostitute and the ragged outcast boy, gaze on this spectacle with trembling delight, what is their excuse? Come, I do not place it on the ground of religion or morality, but mereiy as a matter of common decency—decency so common that it can only raise one blush and die—I ask you, my reader, whether the world can furnish a sight of more disgusting and heart-rending shame than this? A half-naked woman showing her limbs for bread to feed a sick mother or dying sister, perchance, while grey-haired men look on and gloat; and beautiful women, made by the same God who made the dancing woman going down to the same grave-worm, which will feed on her form—gaze on their sister's shame and do not blush. Do not charge me with a prejudice against the Drama. That miserably prostituted drama may be made the voice of genius, the music of religion. But these half-naked women on the stage, tossing in lascivious transport; these painted ones in the third tier, bargaining in pollution, while their pure sisters may look on and up, from the Aristocratic circle—these elegantly decorated bars, where drunkards are educated and poison sold—will you tell me what all this has to do with a pure and intellectual drama? Must William Shakspeare forever be made the cloak of loathsome appetites and nameless pollutions? It was in the Walnut-street theatre. The curtain had fallen and the dancing woman was gone. The ragged boys were fighting in the pit; the traffic of shame was going on in the third tier. In boxes, handsome women were conversing with fashionably attired men, and here and there a puppy, with something like a human face, dressed, at all events, in the garments of a man, was staring those modest women out of countenance, and fastening its obscene gaze upon the face of the pure maiden or the virtuous wife. Of all puppies in the world, the most impertinent is the puppy of the theatre, with an opera-glass in its hand. It was in the midst of this confusion, between the acts, that two persons entered the central box, and at once rivetted every eye. A tall man, attired in plain black, with the slight form of a woman, supported by his right arm. They quietly took the unoccupied seat, and as if by an instantaneous impulse, the thousand eyes of the theatre were turned upon them. The man was, or appeared to be, some thirty five years of age. There was nothing peculiar in his dress. Black dress coat and satin vest, black neckerchief, loosely tied, a faultlessly white shirt bosom, sparkling with a small diamond. Yet his face enchained every eye by a kind of irresistible fascination. The features were bold, his complexion, a pallid sallow olive, indicating the traces of strong physical or mental suffering, and the eyes, so unnaturally large and dark, seemed not so much to gleam as to burn in their sockets. There was no moustache upon his lip nor beard upon his chin, but masses of dark hair fell carelessly over a bold, white forehead. He leaned his elbow on the edge of the box, and gazed upon the curtain with a vacant stare. By his side the slight form of a woman, whose face appeared among the folds of a Spanish mantilla. The dark hues of the graceful robe gave an unnatural paleness to the colorless cheek, and increased the burning light of her large black eyes, which shone from the shadow of their long and quivering lashes. As she raised her hand to adjust the folds of her mantilla, a bracelet was visible, dazzling with the radiance of a solitary diamond. Altogether, the pair would have attracted the eye in any place, and became at once, in the street, ball-room or parlor, the universal topic of conversation. In the theatre the sensation was universal. eyes were turned, glasses levelled; the house buzzed with a thousand whispers. `They are the strangers who have attracted so much notice in Chesnut-street lately.' `He is very, very rich—a millionaire.' `No; a soldier from the Mexican war.' `I tell you that I have the right story, —a Mexican General taken prisoner at Cerro Gordo.' `How odd! That mantilla—bad taste.' `I rather like it. It gives quite a charm to her face.' `What a splendid bracelet I' `Do you observe that diamond upon his bosom?' Whispers like these from fair ladies and fashionable men created a buz-buz murmur in the dress circle. The third tier was somewhat eloquent in its remarks, rather too much so; the second tier quite boisterous; and as for the pit, it seemed to hesitate between a cry of `boots!' and chuck 'em over!' A single instance will serve as an illustration of the public opinion of the pit,— `I say, hoss,' screamed a ragged newsboy, raising himself on his toes, as he stood within reach of the stranger's arm, only separated by that barrier which confines the whirlpool of the pit within its limits; `wot did yer giv' for that ar' di'mond? Jimini, boys, wot a scorcher!' Still the stranger, with his cheek resting on his hand, stared vacantly upon the drop curtain. Not a movement manifested his consciousness that the eyes and impertinence of the theatre were turned upon him and the lady at his side. The lady seemed surprised, her cheek flushed, her dark eyes dropped their glance. But the mantilla, which half-concealed her smooth black hair, and floated over the outline of her small but lovely form, could not be forgiven. It was an unpardonable sin, in a Philadelphia theatre, where everybody must dress like everybody else, or be pointed at and `put down.' `How odd!' trembled all over the dress circle. At last the lady whispered a word in Spanish,— `Juan!' He turned and gazed upon her with a look whose mingled meaning it were in vain to guess, and exclaimed with an evident effort,— `You seem melancholy, Isora? In a moment the curtain will raise and the play begin. It is indeed a very dull place, a crowded theatre.' He leaned back in his seat, and the lady, with a single red spot glowing on each cheek, murmured in almost inaudible tones, still speaking in Spanish, you will remember. `But the letter, Juan?' A sudden, nervous start shook the stranger's frame. He turned quickly, as though he had been bitten by an adder; a cloud rushed over his brow. Mastering his agitation he composed his pale features in a smile,— `I cannot show it to you now, Isora. It is postmarked New Orleans. Your brother is now in that city; he is on his way to Philadelphia—he will be here in a few days.' How her face flushed from its sad hue into a rosy life. `Oh, I am so happy, Juan! He will be here in a few days; he has forgiven his wayward sister for her wanderings—he will be your friend, Juan. Is it not so? Blessed Virgin! we will all be so happy!' Juan smiled; and then his eye flashed, his brow was corrugated, the expression of his sallow face was horrible—it passed like a cloud—he smiled again. `This letter, Juan, is from my brother?' Again he started, once more that expression, and then the calm smile,— `No more now, Isora, when we return home I will tell you all. For the present,— your brother, Don Antonio Marin, will be here to-morrow—perchance to-night.' He said no more, but while the curtain rose and the play went on, and the audience laughed, and hissed, and stamped, he sat with his cheek upon his hand, his large eyes fixed upon the stage with an absent stare. It cannot be denied that his face was in vested with a cold, pallid beauty; the firm, aquiline features stood out in the glaring light, like the head of an antique statue, darkened by the dust of ages. Yet never once, during all the play, did he turn from side to side, or change his fixed, unvarying glance, though Forrest was on the stage and the play was Richlieu.—Forrest and Richlieu after the shameless display of a half-naked woman's limbs! The play was over, and the audience, pouring from the various boxes of the theatre, swarmed through the outer corridor, and swept like a torrent into the street. Amid the crowd descending the stone steps in front of the theatre, the form of Juan and the lady were marked, prominent; his head rising above the crowd, her mantilla contrasting with the rainbow dress of the other women. The other women! Yes—courtezan and fine lady mingled together in the crowd that poured from the doors of the theatre, and the flaming gas-lamp on the pavement disclosed, with impartial light, the face of the sinless girl and the painted visage of her sister-woman, the child of shame. Suddenly, even as Juan and Isora were descending the steps, a cry was heard; the crowd rocked to and fro—a strange wave of human faces—and universal clamor and confusion tossed the strongly contrasted mass together. It was shouted that the stranger had been robbed, his pocket-book stolen; four or five men, with red faces and noses of extraordinary development, were seen rushing toward him, making with their fists an extemporaneous lane through the centre of the crowd. They were known at once as Police Officers. `I say, Mister,' cried the foremost, a rotund man, on whose rich-colored visage brandy had not been showered for nothing; `I saw the fellow hook your pocket-book—will know him agin. What's the figur? Damage very ser'ous?' Juan bent his lips to the ear of the red-faced man, as his brow manifested deep vexation and chagrin,— `Five thousand dollars were in that pocket-book; if you reclaim it by to-morrow morning without touching the papers which it contains, one thousand shall be yours.' `Won't I! Why I've had my eye on the feller these three weeks and know'd he was up to mischief. Your residence, sir? The pocket book 'ill be in your hands before nine o'clock to-morrow morning!' `Enough! We understand each other.— Here is my card;' and supporting Isora with his arm, he pushed down the steps, and presently stood on the edge of the pavement, where stood a glittering carriage with a coat of arms on the panels; a liveried footman holding the open door, and a coachman, also in livery, snoring on the box. `Rather aristocratic!' murmured voices from the crowd. `Splendid turn out!' `Just look at them blooded bays—and that darkey, with one eye and a blue coat!' `Isora, you will enter and go home alone! Urgent business demands my presence elsewhere, for an hour or more. Nay, do not look so reproachful.' From the folds of the mantilla her pale face appeared, as her lustrous eyes were raised to meet his glance. Her delicate foot was upon the carriage step—her hand upon the door. `The letter, Juan?' It was but a whisper and yet her bosom heaved as she spoke the words. `Within two hours I will return home and tell you all!' He lifted her gently into the carriage, closed the door and spoke to the lacqueys.— In a moment the couch was seen dashing away through the hacks and cabs that lined the street. Juan turned up Ninth-street, murmuring as the hurried along,— `She fades every hour—I can see her fade —withering, drooping into the grave. `My brother!' her only word, from hour to hour, She dreams, even now, that I have gone to bring him home!' At the corner of Ninth and George streets, in the shadow of that immense pile known as the Museum, a dark horse stood saddled, the bridle held by a liveried servant. Juan spoke to the servant, and with a bound sprang into the saddle and dashed away, as though his own spirit had maddened the veins of his horse. Up Ninth street, into the Ridge Road, and out into the country. It was a gloomy night in May; the air was damp and misty; the sky one mass of leaden cloud. Along the dark road—the trees on either side appearing like a shapeless mass—bounded the horse, striking fire with his hoofs as he flew, while his master applied the spur and chafed and maddened him to the utmost stretch of his speed. Through the misty atmosphere, a huge white mass arose; looking somewhat like a mountain of snow, shapen by superhuman hands into the form of a Grecian temple. It was a magnificent sight, that College of Girard, looming through the misty night, but Juan did not see it. His head upon his breast, his dark eyes glaring straight ahead, he kept his mettled horse at the same arrow-like speed, and soon left the college three miles behind. Down the steep hill, into the hollow, where an old tavern stands—somewhat retired from the road - its lonely sign creaking on rheumatic hinges. A light shone out upon the porch as the foaming horse, bounding aside from the road, attracted by the echo of his hoofs, the tavern keeper, lantern in hand, came to the door. `I wish you to take care of my horse for an hour or so,' said Juan, as he bounded from the saddle upon the road. The sleepy host rubbed his eyes and surveyed the stranger, with as much amazement as though he hid been rained from the clouds. `You don't live here about, it may be?' he drawled. `Hello! He's gone. Don't much like him—very pucooliar eyes! Not a bad horse, though!' While the tavern keeper stood wondering, Juan had crossed the road, leaped the wicket fence, and was now threading a westward path that led along a broad and gently undulating meadow. In the day-iime, when the bees fill the air with their music, this meadow is very beautiful—a broad mantle of trembling green stretched in sight of the dusty road. But now there was a mist upon it; a floating shroud hung over its gentle undulations and veiled its moist verdure. Soon the path terminated, and before the wanderer rolled the Schuylkill, its beautiful hills and picturesque bridges and island of glorious foliage, all shrouded by that misty veil. To the north over those rude cliffs and down into the wilderness where the herbage and trees are locked in one woven mass of leaves and flowers. Up the steep rock that rises like a wall, stone heaped on stone, and mass piled on mass, with vines twining all about it—like little children around a harsh old warrior—and saplings starting from every cleft, then exuberant foliage clothing the granite heap with a girdle of summer green. The wanderer stands upon the summit and feels the night breeze from the river on his hot brow, and sees the mist gliding among the trees and over the graves of Laurel Hill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. LAUREL HILL. `Two coffins in that solitary vault — two only. —Texan MSS. Laurel Hill! Did you ever see it by day-light—on a Sabbath day, when the crowd, who come hero to gape about the graves, are locked out—on a Sabbath day in June, when everything was silent, save the bees, and all things motionless as death, save, the gentle blossoms, trembling above the grass. It is very beautiful then, with its white monuments and winding walks, its high wall and entrance gate, shutting out the hot, dusty road; its chapel, with stained windows, where prayer is said before the coffin is laid away, in the dismal vault, or planted in the fresh, smoking earth; altogether a place of perfume, bees and flowers, graves burthened with sculpture and marbles rich in epitaphs. Yet I like it not. It looks to me, with its dainty monuments burdened with flowers, like an attempt to be elegant with Death, and decorate his fleshless skull with the ribbons and millinery of the fashionable world. There is too much mockery, too much mimicry of woe, in this elegant cemetry. Too much of— `Here lies my husband Jean, Whose affectionate widow still sells ribbons and laces, At the old stand, No. 29, Rue Jacconot.'* * An epitaph something like this, is recorded on a marble pile in the great cemetly, near Paris. Give me an old graveyard, where the graves are hidden among tall grass and wild flowers, where the tombstones peep modestly above the blossoms and the verdure, and a holy air of repose, as if from God, imbues the place where dead people sleep, and brings sweet messages of immortality home to the soul. But these fashionable cemetrys, Mount Auburn, Greenwood and Laurel Hill. Could you not, my dear friends, keep Fashion in your ball rooms, and leave the grave as it was in the days of our fathers, a holy altar, where none came to look save those who had friends among the dead? `Come boys, we've had our dinner and our wine at the United States Hotel—lobster and champaigne, and all the et ceteras—let's take a cap and go out to Laurel Hill and have a jovial chat as we smoke our cigars amongst the graves!' Does that sound very sweet? Think of a mother, or a sister, or a wife, sleeping in the sod, while a party of half-drunken dandies stroll over their graves, venting their obscene souls in jests that taint the very air. I have even seen one of those wretched manikins, from Chestnut street, whom the tailor makes, stand on Laurel Hill, plying his opera glass among the homes of death. Laurel Hill is beautiful without all this garniture of sculpture and millinery of fashion —it was beautiful long ago, before they made it a `fashionable cemetry.' Down by the river where the trees grew thickest, dipping their leaves in the waters, and the bank arises, rugged with huge old forms of rock, there is many a solemn walk among the quiet nooks shrouded in foliage, or over the steeps shaded by the sighing pine. The sunlight comes in stray gleams, and through the trees the river glimpses on the sight. Gloomily in the shadows the dark vaults are seen, their iron doors sunken in the clefts of the rocks, while, overhead, a leafy canopy waves like a pall. It was down among these haunts of gloom that the wanderer bent his steps at dead of night. No sunlight now upon the vaults, no gleam of moon or star to light, with a solitary ray, those paths leading to the river, those wind-winding ways that climb the granite rocks.— Like the spirits of the dead, the mist glides about the rocks, and winds—so white and cold—among the trunks of the centuried trees. Juan paused before an iron door, sunken beneath a mass of rock, with a pine tree shooting away from the sod in front of it. He took from his breast a key, and the harsh sound of the yielding lock echoed like a shriek through the silence. He advanced, and in the very air rushing from the charnel, felt that death was there. Closing the door he stood in the darkness of the vault; a horrible intense darkness that seemed to shut him in its stifling folds and bind him like a cloak. Silence, darkness, thought! With a phosphorescent match he produced a blue and vivid light which glared at once upon the darkness, disclosing the narrow walls of the vault and shining upon those coffins—there are two—placed side by side on the floor. That blueish light burned for a moment, glittered on the silver plate upon each coffin's breast, and went out. The darkness was more horrible from the glare of that sudden, phosphorescent ray. That ray revealed the features of Juan, working with fearful agony, and revealed the names inscribed upon the coffins. These were the names, glaring for a moment and then gone,— `Isabel.' `Don Antonio Marin.' For the first time the Wanderer spoke,— `I was in the room when John Randolph died, and saw him trace upon a card, with his skinny finger, a single word—`Remorse'— and saw him die, with his eye glazing as he gloated on it. That word I never knew what it meant till now.' He was silent; there was no light to show the hideous writhing of his face. `Isabel! Isabel! You answer me not, for you are cold and dead—the worms upon your brow, the shroud upon your breast— dead. You who shone so beautiful in the Home of Prairie Eden. `Isabel, when you were dying you told me that `there had been too much blood shed,' too much even for the hideous ruin which the betrayer worked for you. You besought me to bring his body from the vaults of Sacrificios and lay it by your side, to show that you forgave him even in death. I have obeyed, to-day Don Antonio arrived—he is here, my sister; by your side, and I, your brother, feel remorse for the revenge which I hurled on his dying hour—remorse.' Silence and thought. `Speak to me Isabel, tell me, is there a hope for me beyond—there, across the black grave? Speak, is there one hope? Isabel, here, beside your coffin, in the cold, dark vault I kneel, and repeat your dying words, The blessed God forgave his murderers even on the Cross! John, there has been too much bloodshed—too much too much. `Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,' was spoken by God himself, and we, John, have taken from God his own time and manner of justice —we have done much wrong; let us now forgive.” `I see your dying eyes, my sister, and hear your voice,— “For forgiveness is such a beautiful blossom to bloom upon our shrouds when we are dead.” A pause once more—sobs—tears. “Let us forgive, and make such recompense for our wrong as is in the power of man to make. Be kind, very kind to Isora— let her never know her brother's fate. Bring hither his body and let let it be plaeed beside mine when I am dead, in token, that after much wrong and horrible crimes, we sleep in death together, and sleep in forgiveness' `These words on your lips, you fell back and grew cold in my arms.' A sound as of a strong heart breaking in agony `I kneel, Isabel; I place my hand upon his coffin—I—I—Oh God!—I forgive him!' Again the silence of Death upon the dark vault. `Behold me, Isabel! My Free Rangers, those outcasts of the land and sea, no longer know that their leader lives. I am alone.— There is no living breast into whose recesses I may pour the agony of my soul—may pour my horrible secret and my remorse. For Isora—oh God! she is dying—every moment she dies before my face. I cannot tell her that it was her brother whom she cursed in the vaults of Sacrificios—no, no! I come to you —speak to me—let me know whether beyond this dark grave there is a hope, whether there is one star in the midnight sky of death?' And shaken from the proud might of his vengeance, the strong man grovelled beside the coffins, and laid his brow upon the slimy floor of the vault. `Remorse!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. THE PERISHING HEATHEN OF PHILADELPHIA. `Ten thousand in a Protestant city, who have no church, no Bible, no God. —Texan MSS. One night, not long ago, I stood in a crowded church and saw three missionaries consecrated for a great work. They were about to cross the globe and preach the gospel to the poor of Hindostan. To aid them in this work some thousands of dollars were showered upon the altar; nay, beautiful women tore the bracelets from their wrists, the pearls from their bosoms, and said,— `Take these and carry the Gospel to the perishing heathen.' Within a stone's throw of that magnificent church, at the same hour, there occurred a scene of somewhat different kind. Behold it. Leaving the church we will enter this narrow alley which branches from the main street. In this narrow alley, the only light that shines is from the dingy windows of the Rum-shop. In this narrow alley, at least one hundred houses or huts are huddled together, some of frame, others of brick, all with their windows stuffed with rags. These houses yield a handsome rent to their owners. You imagine that one family of three or four persons occupies each house? You don't knew Philadelphia. That is evident. Let me show you how a single room in one of these huts—that one next the tenth rum-shop—is occupied. Through the narrow door, into this room with low ceiling, black walls, and floor some twelve feet square. What have we here? By the light of a penny candle, stuck in a porter bottle, you may behold the scene. Close to the wall, side by side, their knees drawn up to their chins, are crouched at least twenty human beings, from the half-naked girl of fifteen to the old man of eighty; here the mother, with a baby on her breast, there the negro, with his rum bottle, and along the square formed by their huddled forms, you see everything that is miserable in nakedness, disease and rags. These are the rum-shop keeper's lodgers, but not all. All day long they prowl the street, picking rags, or begging cold victuals, or stealing a morsel, and at night, they repose here for one cent a head. The porter bottle, which illuminates the room, is held by a huge negro, who, with rags upon his chest, is playing cards with a white woman, who also crouches upon the floor. As the greasy pack passes from the white hand to the black hand, you see a woman— only a miserable rag upon her form—stretched stiffly out in the centre of the room, her bosom, and arms, and limbs disclosed by the light. That bosom is wasted, those arms shrunken to the bone. As for the face, you cannot see it, for her black hair, streaked with grey, falls over it. Does she sleep? Lift the hair from her face and behold those stony eyeballs. She sleeps—and sleeps all the better that she has had no bread for three days. My good Missionary friend permit me to take you by the bow of your white cravat, and lead you from the crowded church into this room—and don't think me impertinen when I tell you, that the Lord Jesus will smile more blessedly upon you if you sell one or more of your handsomely bound Bibles and buy a little bread, a little shelter for these heathens of Philadelphia. Excuse my freedom, friend; I have an odd way of saying things, but as there is a God, you need not go all the way to Hindostan to find perishing Christians. The breath left her body an hour ago. She is cold now. The door opens; a boy, half-naked—for his only dress consists of trowsers that reach to the knee, and a check shirt with one sleeve — a boy comes forward to the light. You see his freckled face, concealed by a mass of matted brown hair, from beneath whose uneven ends a pair of bright eyes gleam with steady lustre. He may be twelve years old, and he may be fifteen; but in sober truth you cannot guess his age from his face, for its lines are sharpened into premature manhood, by a course of severe study. Poverty and starvation are great thinkers. `Mother!' He kneels beside the dead woman, and places his lips to her ears,— `Mother, come! I have that which will buy us bread.' She does not answer him—he shakes her gently by the arm—feels that it is cold. `Mother!' arose the shriek of that poor wretch's agony. `You are so cold—so hungry—you can't be dead? Come—quick I say.' He whispered the last words—`I have money, mother; come!' The gambling negro turned from his game,— `Look yer, young gemmen, ef you don't stop yer dam noise, I'll break yer dam jaw!' The boy did not disturb the negro any more. He felt his mother's hands and bosom and knew that she was dead, and then went out into the alley and leaned his face against the wall, and his tears fell without a sound. She was the only thing that cared for him in the world; she was dead. The little boy looked up to the misty sky and along the alley, and wondered where he should go now? The watchman from the neighboring street yelled,—`Two o'clock, and a cloudy mor'n,' and a dead silence hung over the slumbering city. Where could he go, that motherless wretch? Approaching the light which fell from the rum shop window, over the gutter, the boy drew from his rags a pocket book of dark morocco, which he opened, and spread forth the soft silken notes in his dirty hands. `Money—it must be money—and I can't read—mother could have read 'em. Mother!' His tears fell afresh, and he was turning from the light when a rude hand pinned him by the shoulder: `Come, my larkey; I'll take care of that money for you. O, your a precious one— ain't you! I say, Charley, give us the `barkers;' we'll fix this lively youth so that Judge Cant 'll be pleased to see him. A very fine judge is Judge Cant; though he makes temperance speeches on the bench, he can take quite as big a brand-and-water as any of us.' The boy was surrounded by some half dozen men, with red faces, well-developed noses and flashy guard-chains. They were dragging him along the alley, with some force and a few kicks, when a figure advanced from the shadows and confronted the party. He had evidently been attracted from the main street by the cries of the child. `Hello! It's the gentleman that was robbed. Well, sir, you see we've got him; we follered him up, watched him and found the property on his person.' `Give me the pocket book,' said Juan, as he gazed steadily in the face of the police officer. `Here is your reward—one thousand dollars. Now, what will you do with this poor boy?' `O, as for him, Judge Cant 'ill fix him.— Nothin' pleases Judge Cant so much as to get hold of a young shaver. Oh my! doesn't he give 'em fits!' Juan, or John of Prairie Eden, as you please, drew near the scared and sobbing child, and swept back the matted hair from his forehead. `Have you a name, my little fellow?' `Never had a name. The boys calls me Young Rags, an' my father's gone away, an' my mother's dead, an' them men have been a kickin of me.' Blurting his many sorrows in a breath, he rubbed his fists in his eyes, and sobbed as though his heart had broken. `If you want to know anything about him,' said the Police officer with the reddest nose, `I kin tell you, for I've had my eye upon his mother and father for this five years past.— His father 'listed this spring in the Navy and haint been heered on since. He was a poor devil enough, but once was rayther respectable, that is afore he first left the city, some years back, with the runaway Bank Director. You see McGregor was once this Bank Director's clark—' `McGregor!' John started as he echoed the word. `Y-a-s, Ewen McGregor.' `Ewen McGregor!' John whispered as he took the boy by the hand. `Prove this to me, and I'll make your information worth money to you.' His voice was tremulous; he laid his hands on the police officer's arm. `Prove it!—Why we all know it. You see McGregor went away to Texas, then jined the Mexican army, and last winter came back to town a poor, miserable devil, without one cent to rub against another. He found his wife, whom he'd deserted years before, in a `bad place'—you take, eh?—an jined the American Navy, an' hai'nt been heerd on since.' `That wife?' `About an hour ago, when we first set our watch in the alley to catch this shaver, we found her dead in yonder hole. Guess she atn't got alive sence.—ha, ha!' `Come! show me where your mother lies dead.' The ragged boy looked up into those large dark eyes, saw them filled with tears, and took the stranger's hand. `Come, I'll show you. Ye see I was hungry and mother was cold—' But John of Prairie Eden did not wait for the boy to finish his incoherent ejaculations. The police officers with some, wonder and a few extra-judicial oaths, beheld that tall stranger, disappear in the shadows, led by the child to the dark hut where lay his mother's corse. Into the hut, where the negro holds the light, and thumbs the greasy cards. John bent down, lifted the black hair, sprinkled with grey, beheld the wasted face and stony eyes. Years before he had known her, so young and beautiful. Even amid the wreck made by starvation and disease, he knew her, and traced the outlines of what she had been in the withered thing which lay before him stiff and cold. `You see, we hadn't any bread;' the boy whimpered. `That is, mother hadn't; for what she could git she give me; an' I watched by the theatre, an'—' John took the little outcast by the hand: `Come home with me. While I have one crust left you shall never want.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. Day is breaking in the East, and the morning mists glide like phantoms over the broad Delaware. The grey light of the dawn steals through the curtains of the chamber, struggling with the beams of the lamp which stands near the bed on yonder table. A sad sight awaits us. True, the chamber is luxuriously furnished: the richly papered walls bloom with the warm creations of the artist's thought; the curtains of the high windows are of satin and gold; the carpet from the looms of Smyrna; the bed itself with hangings of white satin and pillows of down, presents an image of voluptuous repose; it is imbued with an atmosphere of luxury and quiet splendor, and yet another atmosphere is stealing slowly into the place, and covering all things with its vague, chilling mist. It is the atmosphere of Death. Beside the bed—the damps of Laurell Hill yet fresh upon his attire—is John of Prairie Eden, his face wearing a dead stupor, an apathy of despair, which blunts its well defined outlines, and covers his eyes as with a glossy film. The sorrow is too crushing for him to feel it now. He cannot feel it, cannot believe, the air seems but a mass of whirling phantoms; it is not reality, but a dream. A dream; and yet to-morrow. Isora lies upon the snowy coverlet of that bed. Her form but half-clad, she rests with her hands folded, her white bosom gleaming ing the light, her eyes closed, the fringes reposing on the colorless cheek, her hair descending over her shoulders, and resting in glossy curls upon her arms. Does she breathe? Ah, the bosom seems pulseless, cold. A faint trembling of the lower lip, alone attests that the soul is quivering there, ere it departs forever. So gently she dies, that it but seems like gliding into a pleasant sleep. So softly passes her soul away, that it seems a lilly torn from its stem and cast upon a smooth lake that bears it tenderly upon its breast and ripples in low music round it as it floats along. At last her lids unclose; how black, how flashing, how beauliful those death-dewed eyes. `Juan!' She knew him and reached forth her hand. He took it, pressed it to his lips and bosom; it was wet with moisture from the kiss of Death. `Juan, I am going. Ever since the day when the rite of the church blessed our union I have felt a burning here—' He laid her little hand upon her naked bosom. `Last night, when I came home, I laid me down to sleep, and felt that in that sleep, my soul was going fast away; yet I could not, until now unclose my eyes, or manifest by any sign I knew you were here. I heard your groans, Juan, your prayers, I felt your tears upon my cheek, but could not speak to you. A few moments now are given to me, and let me lay my head upon your breast, and wind my arms about your neck, and die. My heart shall beat against yours when it flutters its last; my last breath mingle with your kiss. I am so happy, so much peace! Do not weep, Juan; there is a bright angel at the foot of toe bed, who lifts his white wings and says, `Come!' He had taken her to his breast and wound her arms about his neck—ah! they were so cold!—and covered his eyes with her silken hair. But he could not speak. `When you see my brother, for he will come, Juan—tell him that I spoke of him to the last, and died so happy because I knew that he had forgiven me! Tell him—ah! Juan, my arms are cold, I cannot move my fingers. Is it dark, Juan, or have my eyes been covered by a veil?' Over his shoulder she raised her head, glaring around with her large, deep eyes.— They were glassy—a misty film shrouded their dazzling brightness. How her slight form rocked as his broad chest heaved, and struggled, and fell, with the overwhelming agony of that hour. Yet he spoke not, but grasping her hair, swept its glossy masses over his eyes, and wept aloud. `It is dark, Juan—I cannot see you. Holy Virgin! Mary, Mother of God, pity and forgive me, a weak, weak child! Closer, Juan, kiss me. Ice upon my heart, Juan, ice; but I can feel your lips; your breath warms my cheek; My brother, Juan, tell him—ah! the white angel lifts his wings—I see him now —It is light again! Come! come!' A trembling flutter of the lips, and the white angel has borne a spirit home. Those icy arms are round his neck, that icy breast against his own; the glassy eyes, how cold, how dead they glare; the lips that are pressed to his, are chilled and colorless forever. Still he tries to dry the tears with the soft masses of her silken hair and kisses her cold lips, as if to win back the departed soul. Little did the proud, revengeful man imagine this hour, when in her home of Vera Cruz, he cruelly planned her shame. That he should ever weep hot, scalding tears for the sister of Don Antonio; that he should love her better than life, or what to the proud heart is worth all, revenge; and press her dead breast to his heart, and drench her silken hair with the baptism of her agony. May be some white angel had changed his breast, and turned the blight of his revenge into a blessing fresh from God. She died, the victim of a rapid and imperceptible decay, but died without knowing that her brother was the writhing wretch of the Aztec vanlt of Sacrificios; the Destroyer o Prairie Eden, its beautiful maiden, white haired old man and blue-eyed boy. For that ignorance which hailed her dying hour, let us bless the white angel, who lifted its wings as she grew cold and whispered `Come!' THE END.</field>
