The Fleet in Hampton Roads—The signal for getting underweigh—The convoy of merchantmen—Brief sketch of the origin of the Tripolitan war—Groups on shore—The squadron makes sail—The spectacle—The manœuvres of the brig of war—The curiosity of the observers—Sundry speculations of an old sult—The brig takes on board a passenger—Night. It was on a bright, breezy morning early in June, 1801, that the signal for getting underweigh was fired from a flag ship of a fleet of vessels of war riding at anchor in Hampton Roads. The fleet consisted of three frigates and a small gun-brig of twelve guns. The frigates were unequal in size and weight of metal. The largest was the `President' 44; the next the `Philadelphia' 38; and the smallest one the `Essex,' 32. They had the day before dropped down to their anchorage ready for sea. Their destination was the Mediterranean. The system of piracy which had been for more than a century pursued by the Princes and Pachas of the Barbary States, especially, Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli upon the commerce of all nations, at length called for the warlike indignation of the European powers, which had long openly recognized this systemized buccaneering by paying the piratical princes an annual tribute to insure the safety of their respective merchant vessels. This weak and temporizing policy strengthened the evil, while it tarnished the escutcheon of every nation that consented to resort to such degrading measures. Emboldened by their submission to the terms of protection these royal sea-robber each year grew more exhorbitant in their demands of tribute; and on being refused by England and France further payment of protection money, they seized upon their vessels and made captives of those on board. The spirit of the British people was roused, and a fleet was sent against the strong holds of these Corsairs. Algiers and Tunis were severally bombarded and block-aded, but with little further result than compelling these Regencies to consent to take the old amount of tribute. And with this success, if that can be called successful which reflects dishonor upon the party, England withdrew her ships of war. The United States falling in with the custom of European nations also found it necessary to become tributary to these Barbaric Powers, for the preservation of her infant commerce. But at length, as the American mer chantmen began to increase in numbers and to whiten every sea with their canvass, and especially to crowd the Mediterranean with their fleets, the Pasha of Trípoli, protested against the small amount of tribute he received compared with the amount of the commerce of the United States that passed his piratical shores, and haughtily demanded of the United States government that it should be increased. `You have made concessions to the Dey of Algiers and bribed Tunis,' was his language; `Algiers has received a frigate while I have received none. You express friendship and say you desire to do justice. We could wish that your expressions were followed by deeds and not by empty words. You will therefore endeavor to satisfy us by a good manner of proceeding so that for the future we shall have no cause of complaint! But if only flattering words are meant, without performance, every one will act as he finds it expedient. A speedy answer is required, as a delay on your part cannot but be prejudicial to your interests.' Such was the bold and imperative language of the piratical chief of Tripoli not only to the American Consul—but also in a communication addressed to the President of the United States. This haughty missile being unnoticed, the Pacha signified to the Consul at Tripoli that unless a large present in money and a frigate were sent to him within six months he would declare war against his government and let loose his corsairs upon its commerce. The period he designated having expired without the tribute, he despatched an officer with a body of soldiers to the dwelling of the American Consul to cut down the flag-staff. By this act war was virtually declared, and the same day a fleet of his heaviest cruisers put to sea to prey upon the American merchantmen in those waters. The delay of the usual tribute, and the indifference with which the Pacha's menacing letter to the President was met was owing to a new policy determined upon, with reference to the Barbary Powers, on the part of the U. S. Government. Hitherto, its course had been weak and degrading. It had acknowledged its weakness for years by being, with all Europe, tributary to them. But the disgrace was keenly felt by the States, and the power was only wanting, for them to throw off this stigma fixed upon the national shield. The war which had just terminated so successfully with France had shown the navy its strength. It had created also a warlike spirit in the nation, and elevated her pride of character as a people and as individuals. It was at this period of conscious power, and desire of distinction among nations, that the menacing demand for additional tribute was made of the United States Government by the Pacha of Tripoli. This menace at such a time was enough to rouse all the energies of the new Republic. The demand was openly pronounced an insult; and the idea of being longer tributary made the blood burn in the cheek of every true American. `Shall we,' said her orators, `who have sustained a successful war with England, and made France so lately acknowledge our power, shall we pay tribute and bow the neck to the yoke of a barbarian Corsair? Shall we protect our flag from insult by disgraceful bribes when it is in our power to do it with our arms? Shall we, free-born and free, be tributary to a despot? No. Rather let us assert our dignity and show these nations of pirates that we are their masters! Let us dictate terms to them, not they to us! We have been long enough tributary. Tunis is dissatisfied with our last present, saying the guns are too light and the oars too long! Algiers finds fault with us for want of promptness! Morocco will soon expect tribate also. Let us no more pursue this timid and disgraceful policy, but at once send our ships of war to their coasts to teach them submission or drive them from the seas!' These sentiments found an echo in every bosom throughout the land, and a squadron was at once ordered by Congress to be got ready, and despatched to the Mediterrancan. Before the six months had expired, which the Pacha had fixed for an answer to his demand to come from the United States Government, a squadron was fitted out and ready for sea. It had dropped down to Hampton Roads, the day defore the opening of our story, to wait for its commander, Commodore Dale, whose broad pennant was hoisted on the President, 44. This officer had been detained in Washington waiting for despatches, and reached his ship in a pilot-boat at sun-rise, when he instantly gave the signal for putting to sea. The report of the heavy guns, drew many people to the different points of land commanding an open view of the road-stead. The warlike mission upon which the fleet was to be sent, was well known, and there was the deepest interest felt in every thing concerning it. It was at that period the navy of the Union. There were a few other vessels of war in different ports, but these were all that were then in commission. Around that little squadron were concentrated the pride, the hopes, the ambition of every American, who loved the navy and rejoiced in her laurels. She was then just acquiring that popularity, as a branch of the national defence which she now so eminently enjoys, and which she so well merits. The vessels of war were not alone in the Roads. A fleet of at least twenty merchantmen, consisting of ships, barques and brigs, and two or three clipper schooners were anchored to leeward, waiting for convoy to the Mediterranean and the coast of Africa, whither they were bound; for the seas between Gibraltar and Mogadore were infested by piratical cruisers, which were constantly hovering about the straits, vigilantly upon the watch to pounce upon any unprotected vessel of any nation. The morning was clear, and without a cloud in the sky. A light westerly wind just stirred the trees on land, and rippled the waters of the bay. The blue wreath of smoke from the gun was borne by it slowly sea-ward, and had not faded into the air ere the frigates' three top-sails were spread to it, her jib was set and she was seen by the spectators on shore to move majestically from her anchorage ground, with her yards squared and her head seaward. In a few moments afterwards, her top-gallant sails and royals were displayed aloft, and with her courses hauled up and every thing drawing free, the noble vessels stood out to sea. The attention of those on shore was so much taken up with watching the motions and preparations of the flag-ship, that they did not observe that the other vessels of war followed her manœuvres in every respect, and were under sail and standing seaward almost as soon as she was. The merchantmen also got underweigh, but with less diligence and skill, the leading frigate being far to le eward before the first merchant vessel got her anchor up. In less than half an hour all the vessels were underweigh and standing eastward, presenting a fine sight to those who were looking from the shore. The wind freshened as the squadron moved seawhrd, and as every vessel had early set her lower studden sails, the picturesque effect of the marine scene was thereby greatly increased. The whole sea was white with canvass; and to the eye of a poet it would have seemed that a city of white marble pyramids was in majestic motion over the waves. `That's what I call a sight, to make a blind man overhaul his eye-tackles, and take the hatches off his spy-glass,' said a sailor amid a group on a pier-head, who had lost his leg in a fight with a French cruiser. `Them frigates will spank it away to the straits, and by sun-down every merchantman 'll be left hull down astern; and Dale is not the man to heave too for 'em, if there's any powder to be burned ahead.' `I used to sail in a brig out o' Charleston,' answered a sort of fresh-water looking sailor, with a short pipe in his mouth, `and used to think there was nothin' like a snug built trader; but since I've cruised in a frigate I can't bear a merchant vessel!' `Jiss so,' answered Bill with the one leg; `it's as different as ridin' in a stage-coach and a market-wagon, ashore! Did'nt you see how altogether them frigates topsails fell, as if one man held the ropes of 'em all and let go at once! I wish I was aboard there. It makes me proud to look at the beauties!' `I should think, friend, you'd had enough of the sea from your appearance,' said a man near him who looked like a shop-keeper. `And do you think, master, because I've lost one leg fightin' Jonny Cropeaus, I can't spare another to fight the Algerine corsair on,' answered Bill indignantly. `A man's limbs are his country's. My country has got one o' mine, and she's welcome to the rest.' `Bravo, Jack,' cried several voices. `Hurra for the old tar!' `Let's give the fleet a hurra?' cried the old seaman, animated by the praise; and flinging up his tarpaulin he gave three cheers, in which the crowd loudly accompanied him. `There's a gun fired from the leading frigate,' said the sailor who had sailed in the merchantman, `she must have heard us and answered it!' `That's all you know about the navy ships,' said the old tar; `they don't burn gun powder for nothing. They could'nt hear us, it stands to reason for she's a league to leeward; and if they did that gun was not fired for us. She would'nt ha' answered a cannon much less a hurra. Merchant ships may do such things for they don't know no better. Keep your eye on the fleet and you'll see, if you know how to understand sea-manœuveres, that that gun was a signal.' `You are right, Bill, for there flies a signal at the gun-brig's fore,' said the other sailor. `I know'd it, and the frigate has another set! The gun was fired to draw her attention before signalizing. Now watch her. The other frigates don't mind the signal and stand on. There see that manœuvre! The flag-ship has hove to, the brig has luffed a point and is standing on for her!' The attention of the group who had heard these remarks and had witnessed the interchange of signals between the leading frigate and brig was now wholly drawn to these two vessels. The brig stood steadily down for the `44,' and soon was seen to heave to under her lee. A boat was put off from her and boarded the frigate. In the meanwhile the rest of the squadron and the fleet of merchantmen kept on their course until the last lagger of the convoy had got abeam of the two vessels, when the frigate was seen to fill away and keep on her former course. The brig soon after followed her example in squaring her yards, but instead of keeping on with the frigate tacked ship and stood back up the bay, close hauled on the wind. The frigate moved on majestically among the merchant vessels, like an Eagle mingling with a flight of pigeons, and when her hull was beneath the line of the horizon she had nearly taken her former place as the leading vessel of the wide-spread, far-stretching fleet. The crowd now began to retire from the pier, but many idlers and curious persons lingered to watch the manœuvres of the returning brig; and various were the speculations upon the object which had brought her back. The old salt with the one leg seemed to be the oracle of the highest authority in this matter. `You don't know nothing about the matter, Mr. Peter last, said the seaman biting off three inches of `pig-tail,' and stowing it away in his larboard jaw; `in the trade o' building shoes and such like leather sheathin' for foot-bottoms, your opinion mout be as good as another man's; but a shoe and a ship is different guess-sort o' things. You're all out when you say that pr'aps Capt'n Dale has forgot his trunk and sent the brig back to port to get it! And Sam Talbot the tavern keeper there shows his ignorance o' ships when he gives it as his 'pinion the brig's come back to get the Captain's case o' liquors. But what can land-lubbers know about sea matters?' `Well, then, Bill, what is your opinion?' said little Sammy Talbot the publican. `Why, at first I thought the brig was ordered to windward to whip up the stragglers and keep the craft all together, and to prevent any on 'em from droppin astern and gettin out o' the convoy; for the merchantmen in convoy, are just as troublesome as so many sheep. A little brig is jist as necessary to a frigate to help her, as a dog to a shepherd when he's drivin his flock to market. But you see the brig's coming up to windward and turned heel to the whole fleet!” `And now Bill what can have brought her back again?' asked Sammy. `This is it, or may I never see a Frenchman at the end o' my gun again; the brig's ordered back to land some o' the long-tog shore dignitaries o' government what went down aboord along with Captain Dale. That you may be sure of! and if we stay here we shall see 'em land!' `There you're mistaken, Bill,' said a fisherman near. `I was close under the stern of the forty-four when the pilot-boat run aboard of her with the Commodore and there was nobody went up the side with him but a midshipman.' Bill looked round at the speaker with a glance of contempt, and replied scornfully, `What does a fishing-skipper know 'bout sich matters! I'm right, and you'll see. But if 'taint this, she's put back to send the Captain's last despatches ashore.' `The pilot-boat could have taken these when she leaves her,' said the fisherman. `So it would,' responded several voices. Bill looked at the fisherman again with a scowl and then glancing round upon the fickle crowd who were disposed to regard the new comer the wisest oracle, he hobbled away in great ire. The brig in the meanwhile stood in on her starboard tack as if she would run for Norfolk and then going about stretched away up the bay until her topsails dipped. The group on the pier had one by one dispersed and the several individuals who had composed it, went to their various occupations. The motions of the brig, however, were watched by others from different positions along the coast; and particularly by gentlemen at their plantation houses, with glasses. Towards noon when nearly up with York river she was seen to tack and stand south with the wind abeam, and only her fore course, topsails, jib and tri-sail set. At the close of the day she had returned nearly to the anchorage ground in the Roads from which the squadron had weighed in the morning. Her near neighborhood again drew many persons to the pier and headlands to watch her and speculate upon her movements. Slowly she stood on, keeping a south-east course and running only under her fore-topsail and jib. The had evidently shortened sail with some object in view, connected with the shore, off which she was hovering. `If I did'nt know that craft to be the U. S. brig Enterprize,' said Bill, who had-recovered his temper and was once more the oracle of the group, `I should, from her suspicious manœnvres to-day, set her down for a buccaneer or a slaver. But the motions of war vessels is of necessity sometimes secret and mysterious. I'd like to overhaul her Captain's head locker and see what orders he's got to keep him shieing about the land in this fashion. There she stands in towards the pier, and we shall soon learn.' The brig was now within a third of a mile from the shore. The sun was just setting and sending his golden line of light in level streams across the molten wave. The sails of the beautiful and warlike looking brig were delicately encrimsoned with the touches of his glowing pencil, and the rippling waters of the Roads danced merrily in their burnished glory. The green shores bending around the bay wore a richer hue of emerald, and the white villas and spires stood in beautiful relief against lawn, forest, and sky. The whole scene around the fair bay was picturesque and unusually lovely. The brig sat upon the water in the midst of the sunset scene, around the centre of all like the goddess of the hour, warlike yet graceful, with bright streamers flying at the fore and at her peak. Suddenly the sun fell beneath the horizon; a flash, and a jet of blue smoke shot from her bow, followed a moment afterwards by the deep thunder of the evening gun. The broad flag curving above her stern at the same instant descended to the quarter-deck, and slowly over land and water came a soft shadowing like the first breath of night. While the group were watching a circlet of blue smoke from the gun, that was ascending with an undulating motion, high above the brig, while the body of the cloud rolled heavily away, low upon the water, a carriage drove rapidly down the pier. A gentleman with a cloak on his arm alighted from it and hastened to the extremity of the mole-head. He waved a handkerchief, and in a moment after the quarter boat was lowered from the brig, which hove to. In a few minutes the boat reached the pier. `Way enough,' cried the midshipman, and the six oars rose simultaneously into the air and remained upwright, while the coxswain steered the gig to the foot of the stairs. `We feared you would miss the brig, sir!' he said. The gentleman, sprang in followed by a servant with his baggage, and seating himself replied, `I was surprised to learn as I got into town just now, that the fleet had sailed, and feared I had lost my passage in the frigate. But I see the brig has waited for me. `Let fall! Now give way!' cried the young officer to the men, and the boat shot away swiftly from the pier and its crowd of curious observers. `Captain Dale did not open a letter to him in the package delivered to him by the Secretary of State, imforming him that you were to meet the fleet in the Roads, until we had nearly run out to the Capes, where he sent the brig back. We have been standing off and on all day and have just run in expecting you about this time. We have been watching the pier-head closely for a signal ever since noon.' `I am sorry to have detained the brig,' said the gentleman, who was a newly appointed Consul to Algiers, going out in the frigate; `but I could not leave the country without paying my friends near Richmond a parting visit. But I trust we shall overtake the squadron!' `Yes; in less than eight and forty hours. The convoy will keep them dragging along at a slow rate. The brig is a fast walker, and can overhaul any thing she chooses to! See what a pretty model, sir! How like a sea-bird she sits upon the water. She rakes just enough to make her feel her masts and give her a saucy air!' `She is certainly a beautiful vessel, though I am not sailor enough to make my opinion of any value,' said the Consul, admiring the symmetry of her yards, and the neatness of her top hamper. `But she presents a very neat and tasteful appearance, and is a fine object to the eye.' `Way enough!' cried the midshipman as the boat shot along side. The men simultaneously tossed their oars into the air, and the boat run under the gangway. The man-ropes were thrown into her, and the passengers who had so long detained the brig, was received on board with due honor, and the gig was hoisted up again at the starboard quarter. `Now all hands make sail,' shouted the captain. `Set every thing that will draw, Mr. Downie,' he said to the officer of the deck; the wind has nearly all gone down with the Sun, and there is scarcely breeze enough to force her along three knots!' The brig was soon enveloped in a cloud of canvass from deck to truck, and moved through the water with just motion enough to give a low, rippling sound under her counter. Gradually, as the shades of deepening night fell over the sea, she faded from the eyes of the groups of spectators on shore, who now severally dispersed to their homes: having been rewarded for their day's curiosity by its full gratification; for Sammy the publican, had in a whisper, asked the servant of the Consul, who his master was; and the information he received from the communicative black, he was not backward in dispensing for the general benefit. `Just as I said! I know'd it Sammy,' said Bill, stumping up the pier after this rubicund nosed little personage; `I know'd they were waiting for some Government man.' `And you said so, Bill, too!' `That I did. Talk to a man-o'-war's man! He knows more in his little finger than a land lubber in his whole head!' `And 'specially sich a intelligent man as you are, Bill!' `You has got sense, Sammy, if you be a shore-fowl,' answered Ben, not a little gratified at the flattery of the Inn-keeper, who picked up all the old tar's stray sixpences, and therefore found it for his interest to keep him in good favor with him. `Nobody after this 'll dare to dispute you, Bill, in sea matters,' he said as they reached the Inn door. `Not they, Sammy. What does a shoe-maker or a skipper of a fishin' smack know o' men-o'-war manœuvre?' `About as much as you do about preachin,' said the publican. `And that is not true nother, Sammy, for I onct preached a sarmont and convarted a woolly nigger. Come, let's stump in and have a glass, and I'll tell you how it vos.' Bill then hobbled in with a thumping noise of his wooden leg, like a washerwoman's pounder; and seating himself with a stiff glass of half and half grog in his hand, he began to relate his story, to which, as it does not materially concern our own, we shall not trouble the reader with listening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. The calm continues—The way to detect the direction of the wind —The Consul and Captain—The moon rising, and the view of the shores—The villa of Colonel Dudley—The discovery with the spy-glass—The current—The lead hove—The wind rises—The brig in motion—The strange craft—The brig is hove to—The stranger and mystery. The wind died with the day; and the brig-of-war had not sailed far from the place where she had filled away, after receiving on board the Algerine Consul, before it fell calm. The rose-colored glow of the western sky yet lingered on her masses of canvass, tinging them with a delicate flush, and the dark green line of the shores, with their irregularities caused by woods, towers or hill-tops, was plainly visible, with here and there a light flashing off across the water. The beautiful vessel lay half a league from the land, motionless, `Like a painted ship upon a painted ocean.' with all her sails still spread to catch the faintest zephyr that flitted past. The glow of the west was fast fading into the gray of evening, and stars in their splendor, and planets with their nearer and purer light, shone from the deep heavens afar, and night and silence asserted their empire. The Captain of the brig and his passenger walked the starboard side of the quarter-deck together, the former occasionally stopping to gaze over the taffrail, and to lift his hand to the west to feel for the wind. The lieutenant of the watch paced impatiently the larboard quarter, and at every other turn in his walk he paused to gaze in the direction in which he expected it to breeze up. The men of the watch were dispersed forward, or in the waist, some leaning over the bulwarks looking to windward, others resting on the guns, or two and two walking fore and aft the narrow space between the windlass and the heel of the bowsprit. There was no swell to make the brig uneasy, and not a rope or sail moved. All was motionless, and the men who spoke together lowered their voices as if in instinctive sympathy with the silence. `Well this is dull work, Mr. Merley, said the young Captain of the brig as he stopped in his silent walk, and lifted the palm of his hand to the west; `we are likely to lay here till the next flood before the wind breezes up.' `The frigates doubtless have the same calm,' remarked the Consul, `so there will be nothing lost.' `No; they carry to sea the same wind they took off shore, and are no doubt making eight knots at this moment, while we have not air enough to open the folds of a lady's pocket handkerchief! Besides, the current is drifting us toward the land, in the direction of Norfolk Head, and we may have to drop anchor.' `I am vexed with myself for being the cause of this annoyance to you, Captain Sterret,' answered the Consul; but my appointment to Algiers was so sudden that I should have been unable to have accepted it if I had left Washington with Commodore Dale, and not have been able to have visited Richmond before sailing.' `It is a part of the brig's duty in the service, this delay on your behalf, Mr. Merley, and I do not reflect upon you at all,' answered the Captain in a frank and slightly apolegetic tone. `We sailors are privileged to grumble in a calm, and find fault with the winds when they don't blow to suit us. If this calm only keeps you my passenger to the Miditerranean, I shall not regret it; and if it holds long we shall certainly not reach Gibraltar till after the commander's frigate.' `I feel a light air, sir, coming from the South,' said the lieutenant of the watch.' `Your hand is more sensitive than mine, Hardy; I feel none.' `By wetting your finger you will be able to feel it, as the side from which the wind is coming will feel the coldest.' `I do; the wind will come out from the South; and now I see the hazes lifting there away. We shall have wind before long.— Take in the studden sails alow and aloft, and let us have the brig in trim for whatever a good Providence pleases to send us. I always look for squalls from that quarter at this season.' The brig was soon lying under her usual canvass, her royals set, and her courses up. When at length the decks were all cleared, and quiet once more reigned on board, the Consul's attention was drawn to a deepening glow in the east, which he pointed out to the Captain, saying: `That must be a vessel on fire at sea.' `Watch it a few moments, Mr. Merley,' said the Captain smiling. Gradually the rich soft flush spread over the Eastern horizon, and suddenly a crimson spot like the edge of a globe of heated iron, rose above the verge of the sea. In a few moments, enlarging till the whole of its deep red disk was seen, came the moon into full sight, flinging her crimson beams far across the level water. `How wildly beautiful is moon-rising upon the sea,' exclaimed the Consul with delight. `At its first appearance it resembled the light from a ship in flames beneath the horizon! See, as it ascends, how it loses its blood-like hue and assumes its native silvery brightness!' `It will bring us wind, sir,' said the Captain, who looked upon every thing in a practical manner; and we shall have it from the eastern board instead of the south, Mr. Hardy.' `I think so, sir; I can feel no air from the south now.' `If we get it from the east we shall have to beat to sea. With the wind abeam she would not be long astern of the fleet. But patience, patience. It will blow from some quarter, and then we must thank God and brace our yards to meet it.' `The light reveals objects on shore with singular distinctness,' said Mr. Merley, looking over the quarter. `Are not these villas that show so white?' `Yes, sir. There are many handsome country seats along this coast, and many fine families. There, on that headland, you see a stately dwelling. Take the glass sir! You discover that it is an imposing mansion!' `Yes. It is surrounded with verandahs, and has extensive ornamental grounds.' `It is the residence of Colonel Dudley.' `The ex-governor under the colonial regime? I understand he is wealthy and hospitable, and has a very interesting family.' `Yes; but people still think he is inclined to Toryism. You know he took no part in the war of Independence.' `Yet he has taken active part in our politics, and I am told has a son he intends to put into the navy. I would trust him, from what I know of his character. `I still have suspicions of these old colonial aristocrats. They never can get over their attachment to royalty. Colonel Dudley was cadet of one of the noblest English families; and he who has a brother a lord and sons who may become noble, can have little love for republican institutions.' `It may be as you say. He has a very fine estate, if all that range of fields which I sweep with my glass, appends to the mansion.' `It is a principality in itself. Don't you feel a wind coming from the North, Mr. Hardy?' `It feels like it. It seems to be flirting all round the compass, like a belle in a ball-room. It certainly does blow faintly from the north.' `Than we shall have it from the nor' west, with a full cheek before midnight. How is it now, helmsman?' `Nearly three bells, sir.' `Heave the lead, Mr. Hardy. I think we are drifting fast landward; and there is an ugly rock, with its head just under water off this point, I should rather the brig should not scrape acquaintance with!' `Mark under water, nine;' shouted the leadsman, from the fore chains. `This is four fathoms shoaler than we ought to be in, with the shore bearing as it does.' `Quar-ter less nine!' sung again the leadsman in a loud, long drawling, yet not unmusical voice, that sounded singularly wild and startling upon the silence of night. `We drift in, and unless the wind soon breezes up we shall have to drop our anchor, or get out the boats!' `By the mark eight!' sung the leadsmen. `There is a strong current setting shore-ward,' said the Captain to his lieutenant. `It is the top of the flood, making up Norfolk harbor, sir.' `If we shoal the water any more we must send the boats ahead and haul off. Come, blow wind, good wind! Give us a little breath, and I'll swear never to speak ill of you more, blow you high or blow you low!' `There is an object moving in the shadow of the land, I think Captain,' said the Consul, who had still his glass directed towards the shore, in the direction of the headland. `It is very indistinct, but it appears to me like a small boat.' `Some fisherman out, probably,' answered the Captain carelessly. `I distinctly feel a wind in the north, Mr. Hardy. We shall have it from that quarter.' `Quarter less eight!' sung the man in the chains.' `We shall have to send out the boats, if we shoal this way! Order the crews of the gig and cutter aft here, to stand by to lower their boats, Mr. Hardy. Hold on! There the breeze wakes up!' `It stirs the water, sir.' `I see it. It comes out of the north. Stand by your lifts and barces, and be ready to take the benefit of the first cat's paw.' `That is approaching, Captain, and if it is a fisherman, he is riding on a fishes back. It looks like a man paddling himself along on the water, with no boat beneath him!' `Let me take a look at him, sir. It may be old Nep himself, coming aboard to pay us a visit, or ask for a passage to the Mediterranean.' The Captain took the glass in his hand, and after arranging the focus to suit his eye, levelled it shore-ward at the object which had attracted the attention of the Consul. `It is a curious craft, and as you say, looks like a person walking on the water. Now I can see him plainer still! It is a man paddling himself along towards the brig, but what he is in I can't see. I discover no boat.' `Perhaps, sir, his boat has filled, but not sunk, and he is trying to reach the brig,' said the lieutenant. `It may be so,' said the Captain again levelling his glass. `Man the third cutter and send out and pick him up.' `Third cutters away!' cried the lieutenant. The shrill whistle of the boatswain, was heard piping the order, and the lads sprung aft to the fall. `Vast there a bit,' cried the Captain' `I can see him now as he approaches. He is paddling on a plank, and makes good headway at that! He'll reach the brig without our help, Mr. Hardy!' The object of general interest grew momently plainer to the eyes of all on board, and rapidly approached the brig. He was paddling very fast, and the quick strokes of his paddle distinctly reached the ears of those who were watching from the brig. `Stand by there in the gangway one of you, to throw him a rope,' cried the Captain removing the glass from his eye. He is quite a youth, Mr. Merley, I saw with the glass as the moon fell full on his face and figure.' `He must have met with some accident, and has saved himself on a plank,' said the Consul. `Or more likely some runascape from the shore, trying to get out of the country in the brig,' said the Captain, `There she breezes! Brace up Mr. Hardy. We'll soon have a piping wind spanking down from the north. What water there in the chains?' `Eight fathom, sir!' `Well. Come in board! Now she feels the air aloft? See how prettily her royal swells out like the breast of a pair of well-fed partridges, Mr. Merley. Now her top-gallant sails stretch their idle wings and fill out! Hark there is music! Hear that ripple about her rudder. Give the forward braces another pull, Mr. Hardy. That's well! A small pull men, at the weather main-brace. Well! now her top-sails begin to make very handsome baloons, and her jib looks as if she wanted to stretch ahead, and walk after the frigates on her own responsibility. Dash! There breaks a wave under her bow! The sweetest music I ever heard, Mr. Merley, is that of a vessel getting under motion after a calm!' `But the lad on the plank, sir,' said the Consul, who had been watching him through the glass, while the brig was being brought under steerage way. `I had like to have forgotten him. I don't see him.' `He is off the quarter here; the change in the heading of the vessel has thrown him in this direction.' `Yes I see him now! He is waving his hand. He finds we are running away from him. Hark, he hails! Aye, aye, ahoy! What in the devil can he want, half a league at sea on a plank at this time of night, or at any time of day for that matter. Mr. Hardy we shall have to heave the brig to for him.' `I trust so, Captain,' said Mr. Merley, with deep interest, for the fate of the person, manifested in his manner. `It is a pity to lose a thimble full of this fine breeze, but it won't do to leave the poor fellow, whatever has brought him to sea on a plank, to the fate that will probably befal him before morning, if this wind rises to blow stronger as it is likely to do.' `Brig ahoy!' came clear and strong across the water, evidently in the voice of a young man. The tone was manly and full, and wholly divested of any thing like apprehension. `Heave her to, Mr. Hardy, and send out the third cutter.' `Aye, aye, sir,' cried the officer, passing the order forward. The men sprung to obey it with alacrity, for the man was plainly visible to every eye, and all the men as well as the officers, felt an interest in knowing who he was. In a few seconds the boat which was hung astern was in the water, and the men sliding down the falls into her, were soon giving way in the direction of the young man, whose features were now plainly visible through the glass. The brig which had been running three and a half or four knots, ni the meanwhile, was luffed so as to shiver her head sails and deaden her headway, to a couple of knots. `I like that chap's voice. It has metal in it, and rings with a manly tone,' said the Captain, as he watched the boat as it pulled towards him. `What can be his motive in putting to sea on so frail a support!' observed Mr. Merley. `Some freak; or some rogue. If he had escaped from a wreck, he would have put in towards land instead of paddling from it.' `I should think so. He was close in under the land in the range of the villa of Colonel Dudley, when he first attracted my attention.' `He has been taken into the boat. Luff a little, helmsman! The lads will have a long pull after us.' `We shall lose quite as much time, sir, in holding to the wind as in heaving to. Had'nt I better lay the maintopsail to the mast?' asked the lieutenant. The Captain cast a glance astern at the boat, which did not seem to approach very perceptibly, and then over the side to mark her rate through the water, and gave the order to heave to. In a few minutes the cutter was along side, and the Captain after giving a loud order to fill away, went to the gangway to see who it was that had so strangely detained the brig. `Come, sir, jump on deck out o' that, and report yourself,' he called out to him. `You are a pretty fellow to bring a U. S. Brig to, in this style. What's the name of your craft, hey?' said the Captain half-angrily, half in good humor, looking over the side. `I beg your pardon for delaying the vessel, sir,' replied the young man from the boat; and then seizing the man-rope, he lightly ascended the side ladder and sprung upon deck. He was a youth not more than nineteen, with a tall, manly figure, and a countenance dark but singularly handsome He was bareheaded and without jacket or shoes; but there was about him an air of refinement and birth, that needed none of the conventional aids of costume to indicate his position in society. The moon shone bright and clearly exhibited him to every eye. `How is it that you have exposed yourself at sea in this manner, sir!' asked the Captain, after observing him a moment in silence. `I was in hopes to have reached the brig without giving you any trouble: and but for the wind which set you in motion, I should have done so.' `But what object had you in boarding her, and in this style?' `A love for the sea,' he said in a careless tone. `I learned you were bound for the Medeterranean, and that there would probably by service seen there. I would have shipped earlier could I have done so.' `You don't mean to say you wish to come in the brig before the mast!' `Yes sir, if you will permit me to do so.' `And to sail in the brig, you put off to her on a plank.' `Yes sir. You were becalmed, and I believed I could easily reach her.' `You have deserved well the berth you sought, and shall have; for true men are worth their weight in gold these days.' `Have you been to sea?' `No, sir.' `Mr. Hardy, you will take this young man into your watch, and the gunner will add him to his mess.' `I thank you, sir,' answered the youth with an expressive tone of voice. `I regret I should have detained the brig' `Not at all. You are worth all the delay, or I am mistaken in my man.' `Come bear a hand there, and have that cutter up at the devits in a trice,' shouted the lieutenant, as the Captain walked aft to the quarter deck, where stood Mr. Merley. `Consul,' said he, in the frank seaman-like way peculiar to him, `did you notice that young man's appearance.' `Yes, and was struck with it. He sprung upon the deck from the gun as he came on board, and stood before you with the air of a young Indian Chief.' `I noticed it. His place, let me tell you, Consul, is not forward of the capstan; and if he goes to sea long, he will not be a great while before the mast.' `It is my impression, from his appearance, that he belongs to some highly respectable family, and has left home privately, from a spirit of adventure.' `That is mine also. I thought so when he said he wanted to ship. But I did not let him discover my thoughts, but treated him as if he was only fitted for the place he sought. He is evidently bold, fearless and adventurous, and so long as he chooses to remain in the brig he will be useful.' `But if you believe him to be a respectable young man, ought you suffer him to remain with the crew?' asked the Consul. `And why not, Mr. Merley? It is no degradation to serve before the mast. Some of the best officers in the navy came into it over the bows. Promotion is free to talent and energy. If this youth—be he the son of the President—has taken a liking to the sea, preferring it to the artificial life of a city, or the atmosphere of a drawing-room, let him follow the bent of his humor. If he is true to himself he will make for himself a name. If half of the young men in shops would go to sea before the mast, they would make better members of society, and ennoble their own natures.— The profession of a sailor is truly noble. His home is ever between the ocean and sky. Nothing about him is low and debasing. All is grand, vast, sublime. God's Heaven is above him, with its stars and silence, and God's sea is beneath him, with the eternal music of its waves. At sea men learn no vices.' `Yet sailors are generally credited with the possession of all vices.' `The vices sailors have they learn on shore They get them in port. At sea they are a gentle, submissive, steady, industrious set of men. They reflect much. They are often religious. There is more awe, as it touches God, in the bosom of a sailor, than in that of most of the landsmen.' `Have you any objection, Captain, to sending for the young man into your cabin. I should like to ask him a few questions.' `None at all. There he is already at work at the fall, as if he had regularly shipped. I have taken a fancy to him.' `He is evidently a young gentleman, and perhaps I may know his family. In case he should prove to have eloped it would be your duty, I think, to land him at the Cape.' `I will see what he has to say, as soon as I can leave the deck. The wind is settling to the north west, Mr. Hardy, and will blow steadily all night after it once gets breezing stiff. See how fast she is moving through the water.' `Hold the reel!' cried the lieutenant in a loud tone. Two of the watch came aft, and one of them taking the reel and another the minute glass, a midshipman tossed the chip into the water. `Watch!' cried he, as he turned the wheel rapidly round. `Turn!' he said; and the reel revolved with velocity as the man held it above his head in both hands. `Out,' cried the man inverting the sand-glass. `Six and a half, sir,' answered the midshipman. `That is doing bravely,' said the Captain with animation. I am going below now, Mr. Hardy; and when you get the Cape abeam and the wind blows steadily, set the weather lower and topmast studdensails. Get all out of her you can! for recollect there is a long chase ahead of us to overhaul the frigate.' `Aye, aye, sir,' answered the lieutenant, the next moment giving the order to set the lower studdensail. `Now, Mr. Merley,' said the Captain, `I will go below with you and let you question this youth. I have some curiosity to know more of him than he has chosen to communicate of himself. Mr Rowe,' he said to the midshipman of the watch,' send that raw hand that came off to the brig on a plank, into my cabin.' `You are wanted aft here, Captain of the Plank,' said the pert little middy, going into the waist. `You need'nt bring your chest and other toggery.' The youth strode aft to the quarter-deck with the air of its maser, heedless of the jest of the lad upon his scanty wardrobe. `The Captain wants to see you below,' said the lieutenant. The young man, bare headed, and without jacket or shoes, as he came on board, hesitated a moment, and then descended the companion-way into the Captain's cabin. A lighted lamp swung by brass chains beneath the closed sky-light, and shed a bright light upon a table in the centre, at which sat the Captain and his passenger, the Consul. As he entered the glare fell full upon his face. His hair was almost perfectly black, and was carelessly worn long upon his temples and round his neck. His countenance was decidedly intellectual. Its expression was frank and sincere, and indicative of a generous heart. His carriage was something less haughty than when he first stepped upon deck; but his air was still sufficiently proud and bold. His dark eye fell upon the two occupants of the cabin with a calm survey, and for a moment his finely curved lip moved with an expression of impatience. `There is your man, Mr. Merley,' said the Captain quietly, and half-disposed to offer the proud looking young man a seat; but restraining the impulse on reflecting upon the condition he had voluntarily taken upon himself before the mast; for whatever claims he might have to his courtesy, they could not now be recognized. The result of the interview was unsatisfactory both to the Consul and to the Captain. The young man firmly declined answering any questions that might draw from him his name or history, and neither threats on the part of the Captain, nor art and entreaty on that of Mr. Merley could produce any effect upon him. They respected his firmness while they were annoyed by it, and he was at length dismissed from the cabin, leaving their curiosity not only ungratified but greatly increased. This mystery, however, is not so hidden as to evade the magic pen of the romancer, which, like a charmed key, unlooks the secrets of heroes and heroines. The mystery touching the young man's presence on board will, therefore, be unravelled in the next chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. Description of an evening scene—Duncan Howard and his passion —The scene in the boudoir—His brother and Isabel Sumpter— The character of the two brothers—The story goes back to their childhood—The adventure with the bear—The deer hunt—The danger of Isabel Sumpter—The encounter in the water—The rescue, and the death of the stag. A FEW days prior to the time of the opening of our story, a youth, tall in person, with fair hair, blue eyes, large and full, and a countenance, noble and prepossessing, was standing upon a low, wooded cliff, overlooking the waters of the bay. His arms were folded upon his breast, and his face wore a thoughtful and sad expression. It was twilight, when the first shadows of evening steal over the sky without obscuring the scene. On his right and left, curved the long disappearing line of shore, till distance dissolved land into air, and the bounds of the horizon were lost in the hazy blent of earth and sky. Before him stretched the bay, calm and serene. A ship of war rode at anchor far away to the left, black in her distinct outlines; while dispersed here and there over the wide wave moved under gentle sail, many a trading ship and smaller craft. The snow-white sea-gull, balanced himself in the air level with his eyes, or darted downward and skimmed along the surface with a shrieking cry. The fisher's boat lay moored near the shore, and at intervals the smooth deep would be broken by silvery fish leaping from their element high into the air, and then falling back into it with a sharp dash of the parting waters. The waves of the ever breathing sea unfolded their silvery edges at his feet, with low sounds like the murmured dreams from the lips of a sleeping infant. Above his head on the branch of a scathed tree, sat a robin, warbling at intervals a sweet note as if the day had not been long enough for it to pour forth all its joy for its existence, and it would tell the night of its happiness. At the feet of the young man, crouching in submissive posture, but with a look of affection that showed him to be the friend and not the slave of his master, was a noble intelligent looking hound; and ever and anon he would look wistfully up into his face to win, but in vain, a glance of kindness. But the majesty of the sea, the beauty of the hour and scene, the melody of nature and the caresses of affection, were all alike unheeded by the young man. His own thoughts were a world, which shut out the present and visible. `It must be,' he said to himself at length giving utterance to his musings: `the haughty and beautiful girl loves my brother Duncan; and I must forget her, and banish this love that is consuming me from my heart! Let them be happy—I will seek excitement and adventure in the wide world and in its votex of action forget her!' He turned from the cliff as he spoke, and slowly took his way along a path which led by the shore to a noble mansion, situated on an open lawn, commanding a view of the bay. A light twinkled through the foliage from one of its windows. `That is her boudoir! I hear notes of music! She is at her harp. I will seek her while her soul is subdued by its deep power, and pour out before her all my feelings! If she hate me—if she scorn me—I can only fly, as I have already resolved to do! Yet I must see her ere I go! Love me I cannot hope she ever will! Would to God my brother and she had never met! then I would have had her love; I alone been the possessor of the rich treasure! She loved me ere he came to win her! But he knew not I loved or he would not have sought her love. I will seek her and know the worst. Life or death are in her words. Her lips are the arbiters of my destiny!' He approached the mansion by a path half hidden by shrubbery and stopped opposite and near a window in one wing from which streamed the rays of light. From it came volumes of rich sounds, proceeding from a sweet female voice, mingled with harp-tones. He listened with the breathless adoration and secret joy of a lover. The voice ceased, and the harp was silent. He was advancing when a deep melodious voice, modulated by passion and tenderness, fell upon his ear in the place of the sounds he heard. He recognised it to be his younger brother's, the dark-eyed, dark-locked Howard's! He started as if an added had stung his bosom, and involuntarily an exclamation of deep emotion and bitterness escaped him. It was unheard, for the speaker went on to breathe into her ear soft words of love. `That song, dear Bel, hath never been so sweetly breathed from mortal lips. Your voice hath a spell that makes me feel music as I never feel it when others sing. Is it love, ma belle?' Duncan saw his brother as he sat on a low ottoman at her feet, look up into her face with a glance of admiring devotion, and also her own returning smile He saw him press his lips to her fair hand, whose whiteness rivalled the brilliancy of the pearls that adorned its fingers. Fickle and inconstant! thus have I pressed my lips to her fair hand, and thus have I too looked up with love to meet the same returning smile! I will forget her! I need nothing further to assure me that she loves my brother! Alas, noble and beloved Howard! how little do you know the thorns that you are planting in the bosom of your brother! Thou canst not love her as I have loved her! Thy nature is more buoyant, thy spirit lighter than mine! Love with me is life; with thee 'tis but life's pastime. What is the sweet Isabel to thee, that other beautiful women may not also be! But for me there is but one Isabel, but one woman! But love on even with thy deepest love! Worship at the shrine where I have laid my heart as a sacrifice! I will not speak to thee of my bitterness. If thou canst be happy, he so! I love thee too well to mar it! though thou, O thou, my brother, hast deeply marred mine! Yet, as I gaze, methinks there sits a sadness upon her brow, as if her thoughts dwelt on me! She smiles, but 'tis not as she has smiled on me, putting all her heart into it! It cannot be that she, so noble and generous, so superior to her sex, should be so false to me! I will speak with her once more, and then say farewell forever! I will walk awhile in this grove till Howard has departed, and then seek her presence!' And was Isabel Sumpter false to this noble young man? Had she ever loved him, and now loved his brother? Let us review the story of their passion. Isabel was the only daughter of one of the oldest Virgiman families. Her father had been a prominent leader in the provincial Congress; and was now living on his estate at the age of sixty, enjoying the blessings of that liberty for which he had with every other American gentleman of that day risked life, and property, and sacred honor. His estate lay on the Chesapeake bay, between Norfolk and James river, and the mansion as we have already mentioned, commanded an extensive view of the shores of the Bay. In this retirement Isabel was the idol of his affection, her mother having long been dead. The adjoining estate to that of Judge Sumpter's, was the property of Colonel Dudley, something of whom is already known to the reader. The mansion of this gentleman, which we have already had a glimpse of through the telescope of the Consul, was beautifully situated on a headland of the bay, in a grove about a third of a mile from the water. The proprietors of the two estates had been of opposite politics in the war, and little intercourse had existed between them. But as their children grew up, became acquainted, and time merged old differences in oblivion, they were oftener thrown together, till at length a neighborly and friendly feeling was firmly established between the two. The family of Colonel Dudley consisted of his wife, a handsome, strong-minded woman, and two sons, Duncan and Howard. There were two years difference in the ages of these two young gentlemen, and a great difference in their characters. Duncan the eldest, was of a quiet, studious turn of mind, yet fond of the chase and other manly exercises. He loved the beautiful in nature for the sake of beauty, and the universe around him, and a part of which he was, was ever a source of wonder and poetic contemplation to his reflecting mind. The ocean in the loneliness and majesty of its space and power, had for him an indescribable charm; and hours he had spent upon its verge, watching the play of its leviathan-like billows, and listening to the solemn and grand music of its roar. Night after night had he walked beneath the splendid stars, and gazed in awe and admiration upon the glorious display of Infinite Wisdow and Power. All nature to him was a book in which the Deity had written forth the manifestation of himself. The mind of Howard was cast in a different mould. Books he had little love for; and his free spirit spurned impatiently the tramels of tutors and masters. He loved the forests, not like Duncan, for their solemn beauty, but for the game in their coverts. He was bold, reckless and full of adventure from his boyhood. He was a proficient in every hardy sport and his life, save that he dwelt in a house when in doors, was as free and independent as that of a young Indian. He loved danger, for the feeling of independence it gives. He loved to venture upon the bay in a frail skiff, and risk his life in the warfare of the elements. If a hawk's eyrie was discovered on a cliff, he would scale the height, though inaccessible to all others, and make captive the fierce bird. Thus, opposite as were the tastes and characters of the two brothers, they were alike in one point, that is in their devoted love for each other. Néver was fraternal affection so beautifully illustrated, as in the bearing of these two youths towards one another. They also were one in their reverence for the great and noble; in the high tone of their feelings; in the purity of their principles; though Howard from the impulsive character of his being, was often found erring. Such were the two sons of Colonel Dudley at the ages of seventeen and nineteen, when one morning, the day after Duncan's return from two years absence at the University at Cambridge, the two brothers were walking by the shore watching the fishermen in the bay, and talking of a thousand things of the past, the present and the future. They were accompanied by two hounds, a stag-hound and a light, elegant grey-hound. Duncan had one year more to remain to complete his collegiate course, and was now at home during the fall vacation. Howard had resolutely declined fitting for college, preferring he said to be a farmer. He had, therefore, during the period of his brothers' studious absence, remained at home, nominally under a tutor, but rarely reciting a lesson to him, passing his days shooting, boating, and in other sports suiting his temper. Isabel Sumpter had been in Philadelphia since her tenth year, with an aunt at school, and there her father also passed most of his time, occasionally visiting his estate for a few weeks in autumn. The young man had not, therefore, seen her for four years. `I must take you to a famous burrow,' said Howard, as his brother stopped as if he would turn back again; `I have an old she fox there, safely caged in with stakes, that has two young ones nearly grown. I'll let them go while you are at home, and then we shall have capital sport. Last year I run a fox across seven plantations four miles beyong Norfolk, and he took the water. I was mounted on `Billy,' and plunged in and swum after him. I liked to have drowned Billy, but got the fellow's brush, and it now hangs up in the hall.' `Stay a moment, brother, and then I will gladly go where you wish. I want you to admire the beautiful manner in which the waves break upon this floor of sand! they swell up far off from the shore, and then roll inward with a slow and beautiful motion, and with an edge like liquid flint, which breaks like a casket opening and lavishly empties a wealth of pearls at our feet. `I never saw pearls here, Duncan,' answered the practical Howard; `but I have seen the waves break here many a time. And once I was bathing just where we are now, and was swiming off about twenty yards from the shore, to ride in upon the waves which were rolling mountain high, when I saw a large shark lift his huge back from a billow close to me. I instantly dived and as I went down I saw his dark shadow above me, and thought I was lost. But he rode away on the next wave, and when I rose to the surface close in shore, I saw his black fin on the crest of a wave too far off for me to fear him?' `And did you continue in the water?' `Yes, and had at least twenty rides ashore on as many billows, but I saw no more of him.' `You were rash and imprudent.' `If you call that rash, brother,' said Howard, indifferently, `what would you call an exploit of mine last winter with a bear. Judge Sumpter's servants came running over here in great alarm one night, saying that a bear had entered the negro quarter and carried off a young negro boy. The Judge was away and the agent was at Norfolk, and the blacks had no fire arms. I was in bed, and instantly rose and got my double-barrelled gun, and gave Black Zip my ducking piece, and calling Belt and Lightfoot, I started on the track of the bear, which the negroes pointed out to me. It was a moonlight night, and when once the dogs took the trail we travelled rapidly. A mile from the quarter we tracked him to the old Tobacco house down by the Red Spring. The dogs stood outside and filled the air with a terrific noise of barking and yelping, but feared to enter the long dark building. The moonlight which streamed in through the ruins showed me the bear— a huge black fellow in one corner. He was squatting on his hind legs, and held the little negro hugged closely to his breast. He growled and gnashed his glittering fangs as he saw me. I leveled my piece, and was about to let him have sixteen buck shot in his head, when Zip knocked it up, crying, `Gorra,—massy, young masser, you kill de little nigger sure for sartin.' The piece went off, and with the jerk, and one barrel firing the other, both were discharged into the roof of the building. I threw down my gun, the bear howled horribly, and the negroes yelled and the hounds barked louder and more fiercely than ever. The little negro made no cry, and I believed the bear had pressed him to death. I now told Zip and the others, among whom were the parents of the boy, that if they meddled with me, I would let the bear cat the boy. I then tried to coax the dogs to attack him, but they proved cowardly. So I resolved, savage as he looked, to do it myself. If I had a rifle, I could have settled him with a single ball. The gun I now had I knew to coutain only duck shot. I was therefore fearful of hitting the boy. So I laid it down, and took from my pocket my jack hunting-knife; and this very blade. he said, showing Duncan a jack-knife with a blade not more than three and a half inches in length; and crept towards him, grasping it in this manner, firmly in my hand. My other hand I wraped up in a blouze jacket belonging to Zip, making a thick bunch of it on my hand. The bear growled and snapped as he saw me advancing, and as I came nearer he fairly roared. I kept my eye on his, which looked fiery red, dark as it was, and expected every moment to see him drop the little negro and spring upon me. I went nearer and nearer still, and he gnashed his white teeth more and more angrily. Yet he did not stir from the corner or let go the boy. I thought he seemed to hug him closer and closer, the closer I came to him. I got so near him that I could feel his breath as he growled, warm on my cheek. But I was not near enough to strike him. One step more, and not three feet separated us. I drew back my arm to bury the knife in his heart. As I did so, he caught the negro on his left paw and made a simultaneous spring and blow at me with his right. The blow was like a man's blow. It fell upon my chest like a fist. I staggered back under it; but instantly recovering myself I caught a firm hold of the paw, and held it with the gripe of a vice. The bear blew his fierce hot breath in my face, and dropped the boy to release his other paw. As he did so, I buried the knife and half the hilt into his heart! He sprung upon me, nevertheless, with a terrific growl of vengeance, and I fell under him. He got my wrist between his jaws, but he did not close them upon it. He was dead ere he could bury his fangs. I had to call the negroes to take him off from me, he was so heavy and large. The little negro was'nt hurt, but was terribly frightened. The skin of the bear I'll show you when we go home!' `That was true bravery, my noble brother,' said Duncan; `you risked your life in the cause of humanity. Your conduct touching the shark was less praise-worthy. There is a difference between courage and rashness. The coward (not that you are one, mark me!) often is or affects to be rash and imprudent, to conceal his cowardice. The truly brave man only risks life on great occasions. A hero and a bravado are persons of very different characters.' `You are always wise and sensible, Duncan,' answered Howard. `And you ever frank and generous, brother. See yonder snowy sea-gull! How silvery bright his slender pinions flash as he wheels in the air!' `Yes, he could be taken on the wing at this distance with a rifle, as he balances himself,' answered Howard, who saw only a good shot in the object which had drawn forth the poetic admiration of his brother. `There is a group of fishermen on the white beach in the curve of the bay, and from the smoke they seem to be cooking their morning meal. How picturesque the whole party, with their upturned boats, their out-spread nets, their various attitudes about the fire!' `And those are the fellows that prowl about the forests here, and poach all the game. One day I started a deer on the marshes below Rock Hill, and run him to the sea-shore, when he came in contact with the net stretched across the beech, as you see them now. His antlers became entangled in it, and before he could ex tricate himself, or I could come up, the brutes knocked him in the head with oars and stones, fairly beating the noble creatures brains out! I could have served them in the same way!' `But there are plenty of deer here to test your skill with the rifle, Howard. I have seen no less than four in the glades as we have walked along, gazing on us at a distance, in spirited, timid attitudes, lingering, yet ready to fly!' `Yes, they are plenty enough; but a deer should fall only by the rifle. It was shameful, the way those fishermen did butcher that one!' `And here comes a second deer along the snow-white sands, brother, or I am deceived by the distance,' he exclaimed, his eye following the curving shore of the bay, where it gracefully bent to the right towards the seat of Judge Sumpter, the cupola of which was visible half a mile distant over the tree tops. `You are not mistaken! It is a deer! He is coming, dashing along over the hard sand just where the one went I have just mentioned. There is a marsh above here out of which, if you drive them, they are sure to take to the firm beech and fly along it like the wind, till a mile the other side of us they come to a gorge in the cliff, which they are sure to take and regain the marsh-land inland. He is now making for it, and will soon pass beneath us on the shore, unless the fishermen again stop him.' `There are hunters abroad to have started him!' `Yes; and there they appear in sight, round yonder rock, riding like the wind!' `And one is a female, by her flying robe! And she has the lead!' `And will keep it too!' cried Howard with enthusiasm, hastening from the edge of the wood along which the path they had been pursuing led, to the verge of the head-land, which rose forty or fifty feet precipitously above the smooth beach. `They ride well, both of them!' observed Duncan, with animation, as he gained the cliff, which commanded a full view of the sands. `See, Howard! The fishermen have risen to stop the deer! The gentleman waves his hand to forbid it! See, he has cleared their nets at a single leap!' `Bravo!' shouted Howard. He is a noble stag. I can distinguish the gentleman. It is Judge Sumpter. His hat has fallen off, and exposes his white hair. He is an old and keen sportsman! But who can that fearless girl be who sets her horse and lets him go bounding and flying as if he was in his native freedom! See him take that ravine; and she never moved from her firm seat no more than her saddle did! Oh for Billy and to be dashing on by her side! She is beautiful, too! I can see her face distinctly flushed and brilliant with excitement! She must be a Virginian, for none but Virginians ride thus!' `I think it must be Miss Sumpter,' said Duncan. `And sure enough who but she!' cried Howard. I recollect hearing some one say last week that Isabel Sumpter was expected home! She is a noble creature, if it be she; and I could fall in love with her were I a man, for the way she sits a horse. How gallantly the deer carries himself. See how feely, like wings, he flings his fore feet cut and erects his chest. Fly, good deer, fly! you earn your freedom! But if you knew what fair dame followed in pursuit, you would willingly suffer yourself to be taken captive!' `You are gallant, Howard, for a youth of seventeen,' said Duncan, smiling. `But the lady is very beautiful. What a superb figure and air! How expressive of high enjoyment her face is! All is animation in her! How gallantly the old gray haired hunter rides close behind! In a moment the deer will pass us and the next moment they, and then we shall see her better! There dashes off your stag hound down the crevice to the shore, Howard!' `And there leaps the grey-hound over the cliff after him, and both to meet the deer! It is too late to restrain their fire! They will be sure to bring him down.' `Perhaps the judge will thank you for the service of your dogs to stop the chase, as he seems to be calling after his daughter, as if alarmed at her fleet riding!' `There go the dogs, both scouring along the sands!' cried Howard, his whole spirit in the scene. `The deer is coming along full in their path? Look! he sees them approaching him, and suddenly stops in full flight!' `What an attitude of surprise and fear! how expressive! He hesitates!' `He will turn from the dogs! See! he hurriedly measures the height of the cliff; now glances at the water. The deep bay of the hound appals him. He turns! He flies back again! He prefers rather trusting to human beings than to brutes! Look at that fearless girl as the hounds sweep on after the fugitive! She means to turn him with her slender riding-whip! Hark! hear that shout of warning from her father!' `And she will perish if she heed it not!' cried Duncan earnestly. The deer maddened and terrified, dashed on with his antlers laid back upon his shoulders! His course was swift and direct as an arrow. He strained every muscle to escape the fleet bounds of the grayhound, who was close at his haunches. The young lady on seeing him turn in his course, had reined in her spirited hunter, over which she seemed to have the most perfect command, and as he came back on his flight, she dashed fearlessly into his path, leaning forward in her saddle with her riding whip levelled as if to turn him again! She heard not, or heeded not the voice of her father warning her to keep out of the track of the deer, which blinded by fear, would not avoid her. The deer made directly for her, and she galloped forward as directly for him. The path between the cliff and the water was very narrow, and the two horses nearly took up the whole space. `She will be sacrificed,' cried Duncan, throwing himself over the cliff and sliding to the bottom, with risk of life and limb. `The deer will take the water before he encounters a horse, be he never so mad,' said Howard; yet following his brother down the precipice, to the sands. The deer on coming within two lengths of the horse, on which the young lady was mounted, was startled by a loud shout from her father, and at the very moment when he threatened to come in contact with the fiery horse, he swerved suddenly from his strait course, and sought to pass by the edge of the water. The maiden encouraged by this desire to avoid her, guided her horse so as still to meet him. The deer took to the water, and dashed in deeper and deeper into the briny flood, to endeavour to get round her, while in the excitement of the moment, the maiden let her horse, ambitious for the contest, plunge deeper and still deeper to head him, until the water flowed up to the horn of her saddle. At length they came in contact, horse and stag, with such violence as to unseat her. A sharp point of one of the antlers of the deer, which he had levelled to meet the shock, entered the chest of the horse, cleaving his heart, and with a leap high in air, he plunged beneath the encrimsoned flood. The fearless and rash girl to save herself, involuntarily caught by one of the antlers of the stag, who endeavored to shake her off; and finding this impossible, for her grasp was for life, he struck her with his hoofs, just as the dogs took the water to assail him. She was sinking insensible beneath the waves when Duncan Dudley caught her in his arms. Howard, seeing that she was likely to be in safety, bounded after the stag, which had got out of the water, and which the greyhound in a moment after, brought down upon his haunches. Howard threw himself bodily upon him, and forcing back his antlered head with on arm, he plunged his knife deep into his white breast. The crimson tide flowed from the wound, and the stag fixing upon him a look of almost human sadness and reproach, sighed heavily and died.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. The young surgeon—The bleeding—Isubel's restoration—The concoy home—The effect of the maiden's beauty upon Duncan —Howard gallops after the carriage—The illness and convalescence—The growth of young love—The confession— Howard and the sea-gull—The first emotions of jealousy—The boat-expedition planned. Duncan bore the young lady from the waves, and placed her insensible in her father's arms as he leaped from his horse. `My God! she is dead!' exclaimed the old gentleman, as her pale head fell over lifeless upon his bosom. `No, sir! She breathes and lives,' said Duncan; `The terror of the scene has rendered her insensible. She was not wounded by the hoofs!' `And yet I saw the stag strike at her fie rcely. Bless you, sir, for your interference. Isabel! My daughter Bel, my child! Nay, she hears me not!' cried the father with anguish. `It is needful to let blood! If you will permit me sir?' said Duncan diffidently, as he gazed upon the pale, marble, immovable countenance of the young girl, as she lay in her father's arms, her head dropped over her shoulder like a lily broken from its stem. `Are you a surgeon, sir!' `No, sir; but I have learned the art.' `Is not this Colonel Dudley's son?' `Yes, sir.' I will assist you!' said Judge Sumpter; `I beseech you let there be no delay.' Duncan took from his pocket a finely pointed pen-knife, and with a firm yet careful hand, ripped up the close-fitting sleeve of the riding habit, exposing a snow-white arm rounded with the fairest proportions of feminine beauty. He had never been in such a situation before, and felt strange sensations of awe and tendeness. `The ribbon of her riding-switch will serve for a ligature,' said Howard, who now came up from the slaughter of the stag; and tearing it off he bound it round the arm with a firm hand. `You are too rude, brother!' `I have bled rabbits and hounds often,' answered Howard confidently, `and know how hard to tie it.' `But a rabbit and a young lady are very different,' answered Duncan, smiling. `There is a full vein, sir;' he said lifting his eyes to the anxious face of the father; and then dropping them upon the pale, lovely countenance of the daughter. The Judge held the arm while Duncan pressed the vein, and then prepared to inesrt the point of his pen-knife into the deliate azure line. `Your hand I fear is not steady enough, young gentleman,' said the Judge. `It shakes like a leaf, brother; give me the knife.' Again Duncan suspended the knife-point over the beautiful arm and his heart failed him. He felt that it was sacrilege to mar its purity, and the beauty of the maiden, and the novelty of his situation agitated him. `Take it brother!' he said, transferring the pen-knife to Howard; who taking it in his fingers, cooly, and with the skill of a surgeon penetrated the vein. `He could not,' thought Duncan, `have bled a pet hare with more nonchalance; But Howard's sensibilities were less lively than Duncan's besides, the beauty of the maiden had not agitated his nerves as it had done his brother's! The rich blood flowed freely from the alabaster arm, and trickled upon the silver sands; and with painful intenseness of hope and fear, did the father watch the first signs of returning life. What would not Duncan have given to have held her, as her father did, with her head resting upon his shoulder; and gazing unreproved down into her face, as the flitting changes of returning life passed over the cheek! Gradually animation returned. The eye was unsealed and gazed round with expression. The chest heaved with strong efforts to resume its suspended action; and with delighted ears the happy father heard her lips murmur his name. He pressed her to his heart with tears of grateful joy; and lifting up his voice he devoutly gave God thanks for her restoration. `Forgive me, dear father! I was indeed rash to risk so much and give you such cause for anxiety.' `There is nothing to forgive, my dear Bel,' answered the father. `You are restored to me living! There passed an expression of pain across your face! Do you suffer?' `Yes—intensely in the breast! It is over! I recollect the stag struck me with his hoofs. But what has become of Antelope? He was struck also.' `He was killed by a single stroke of the stag's antlers, and there is his body heaving in shore,' said Howard. `Poor, dear Antelope! I can never forgive myself for this.' The sound of his voice seemed for the first time to make her conscious of the presence of others. She glanced round at Howard, and gazed a moment steadily upon his fine face; and then her looks fell upon Duncan, whose deep, expressive eyes met hers and caused her instantly to droop them, while the blood deepened in her cheek. Her father now bound up the orifice, and she said she was so much better that she could walk home. This Judge Sumpter would not permit, and she suffered herself to be placed by him and Duncan upon his saddle. `If you will support her, Mr. Dudley,' he said, `I will carefully lead the horse.' With a strange, palpitating sensation at the heart, novel and delightful, the young man passed his arm around her waist and walked by her side; while Howard got the saddle and bridle from the dead horse, which he gave a fisher's boy to carry. He then gave to some fishermen whom the dangers of the chase along the sands had brought to the spot, directions to take the stag to Judge Sumpter's. He then followed the young lady and her party. For some distance there was no word spoken either by Miss Sumpter or Duncan. She evidently suffered more than she was willing to make apparent, and evidently needed all the support of his arm. He was happy in being permitted the happiness of serving one so lovely and interesting. From time to time her father would turn and kindly speak and ask her how she rode; and tell Duncan to be careful to hold her firmly in the saddle. But he felt diffident even at the slight pressure he found it necessary to use in supporting her. `I will get into the saddle, Judge, and hold her firmly with my arm around her,' said Howard, who now came up. Miss Sumpter smiled at his frank speech and free proffer, and said, `I fear, sir, Sultan will hardly carry double. `Never fear, Miss Isebel; he knows what it's for!' `And pray how do you know I am Miss Isabel?' `I heard Miss Sumpter was coming to Virginia with her father. and that she was very beautiful; and as this is Judge Sumpter, and you are very beautiful, I take it you must be Isabel. Besides, I recollect your smile. It is just the same as when you were a little girl, and used to thank me for young squirrels and birds, when I would give them to you.' `And are you Howard?' she asked, with a look of animation and pleasure. `Yes; and I am very glad you have come home again. It's dull enough here without any body! Duncan is no company for me!' `And do you really expect, Sir Froward, that I am to be a companion for you in all your forest tramps, and forays by shore and moor?' asked she, laughing. Howard looked confused and blushed, and then answered petnlantly, I forgot you had been in Philadelphia, where country born girls soon lose their naturalness, and affect to despise the scenes and pastimes of home! Well, brother Duncan, then, will make an excellent companion for you. He can be as grave as a quaker, if you wish it. Look at him now! He looks as if he were— Take care, brother, you will let Miss Isabel fall with your careless hold of her! I should think she was glass. That was a fine escape you had from the deer! Duncan had you in his arms in a moment, or I believe you would have gone for it!' `And then I am indebted to you, Mr. Dudley, for my preservation from the antlers of the stag,' she said, turning and fixing her fine dark eyes upon him with a look expressive of the deepest gratitude. `My life would have cheaply purchased your safety, Miss Sumpter,' replied Duncan with feeling; `but I can lay no claim to any merit in your preservation. I merely was so fortunate as to save you from further danger. Permit me, with my brother Howard, to congratulate you on your return to Virginia. `I thank you. I should not have recognized you. I only guessed who you were by hearing my father address you as Mr. Dudley. You have so altered!' and she surveyed his fine person and noble, intelligent and now blushing countenance with admiration. `I will not trouble you to support me longer! I feel very much better. The pain in my chest is slighter than it was! I shudder to think in what danger my wild riding after the deer involved me. It has also killed poor Antelope. Dear father, if you will permit me to walk I can do very well! Mr. Dudley must be tired holding me on!' `By no means, Miss Sumpter! It gives me pleasure! It is a happiness!' he hurriedly repeated, in a very embarrassed and confused manner. `If you will give me your hand I will spring to the ground! There! That is better! I feel that I can walk very well!' `Will you lean on my arm?' he asked, tenderly. `Thank you,' she gracefully replied. Her father gave her his arm also, while Howard, bounding upon the horse, galloped on ahead as he said to send the carriage for them; for they were still half a mile from the house. Her face was still very pale, and occasionally a shadow of pain would mingle with the cheerful sun-light of her spirit, as she talked in a lively manner with her father and the happy Dudley. Never before had he been thrown thus closely into the society of a young lady. His sense of admiration for the beautiful in the sex had before been awakened; but the impression was as fleeting as the presence of the fair object that produced it. His pulse had never bounded to the touch of the hand; his blood had never coursed to his temples at the glance of the eye; nor his soul trembled with joy at the tones of the voice! But now a new being seemed to have been created in him. The eye, the touch, the voice of Miss Sumpter had a singular effect upon him. The sensation was one of exquisite happiness, and he asked not whence it came nor its name! When his gaze first fell upon her marble and lifeless countenance, a piece of divine sculpture beneath his eyes, he felt tenderness fill his soul which went out towards her with all its sympathy and kindness! The exquisite finish of her silent and immoveable beauty made him feel like adoring her. And we have seen the trembling joy, the gentle fear, the reverential admiration with which he regarded her, and how his hand refused the office which was to restore her to life! This was the first unfolding of love! love as pure and fathomless in its deep strength as his own soul. But he knew it not! He asked not whence came the strange, tender trembling delight that overflowed his heart. He was happy in knowing that the fair creature leaning upon his arm was its object. He spoke a little as they walked along. It was complete happiness to let his ears drink in the sweet tones of her voice whether addressed to him or her father. At length they reached the entrance of the ravine from which they had started the stag. A path or cart road along the gorge wound up to the grounds in front of the villa of Judge Sumpter. Here they were met by the carriage, and the young lady was assisted into it. `Get in, Mr. Dudley,' said the Judge, as Duncan bowed as if retiring; `You must see us safely home. We can't part so, after such a morning; and I want to know you and also that gallant mad-cap brother of yours, who is galloping back again here as if he was riding against his neck.' Duncan diffidently complied and got into the carriage. Miss Sumpter was on the seat immediately before him. He felt awkward and embarrassed and kept his eyes down, though he felt he would have given worlds to have been permitted to gaze unseen upon that pale and lovely face. Such was the first meeting of Duncan Dudley with Isabel Sumpter. The following day proved her error in supposing she was not much hurt; for much pain and fever confined her to her bed for more than a week. During this period Dudley daily called to ask after her, and daily sent her gifts of flowers. At length she left her bed for the easy chair in the drawing-room, and he was permitted to see her and to congratulate her upon her convalescence. Isabel Sumpter was at this time just seventeen. She was a charming creature, with a fine generous temper and great liveliness of character. She was singularly beautiful, possessing the dark hair and eyes of the Southron, with all their feminine grace and enchanting manners. Being early left motherless her education was somewhat more masculine than it would otherwise have been. Her father taught her to ride boldly and to love the chase. Her teachers at the boarding-school performed well their task of cultivating her heart and mind. She had left school probably not to return, and had now come to Virginia to remain with her father. Warm-hearted and grateful, she felt full of gratitude to Duncan for his act in rescuing her; and was disposed to regard him with kindly and friendly favor. But her bosom was yet a stranger to the deep tumultuous emotions that moved his. She could not however, remain long insensible to the tender and devoted attention he bestowed upon her as she convalesced. He anticipated every wish and consulted every means to contribute to her happiness. He read to her, sang with her, and almost worshipped her, in his every look and act. For a week he had been a daily guest at the mansion, and the drawing room with its deep bay window overlooking the lawn and the bay beyond, the trellised woodbine clambering around it and softening the light, and Isabel seated or reclining within it, half veiled by the curtain, himself occupying a low taboret at her feet, was to him a heaven on earth. Insensible, indeed, would have been the breast of any maiden under the influence of such deep and ardent devotion. She read his love in the gentle tones of his voice whenever he replied to a question, in the soft beaming of his ardent gaze, in the delicacy of his attentions, and the embarrassed diffidence of his whole manner. Gradually, a kindred feeling was awakened in her bosom, and the light gaiety of her look and voice and manner changed. She laughed less loud and merrily and conversed less. A sweet confusion, a conscious diffidence was perceptible in her replies and she seldom spoke without blushing and dropping her eyes; though hitherto she had looked him so full in the face whenever she addressed him, as to make him shield his own. They had been sitting one afternoon together by the window, the maiden now quite restored to health plying her fair fingers with a piece of needle work, in which, however, she had made for the last hour very little progress. Duncan was reading to her and at every fine passage looking off the page to see its effect upon his lovely auditor, and often discovering her sympathy in her encountering glance. Often their lifted glances thus met flashed and fell stirring each of their young hearts with wild, sweet, fathomless delight. The afternoon stole insensibly into the dreamy twilight hours, and the maiden laid her needle-work upon her lap and Duncan closed his book. Both were silent, gazing through the open window upon the gleaming waters of the bay—which were suffused with the roseate reflection of the gold-hued west. `How full of love and beauty is all this scene,' he said scarce lifting his voice beyond her ear. `How clear and deep the blue of the sky beneath yonder cloud of pearl and gold. Deep, deep! how deep and far beyond the soul's stretch the space the eye traverses. How the mind that would follow the eye that finds no rest, and out-going it would still fly on and on seeking for a shore, falls back upon itself?' `I have had that feeling! It is painful and terrible!' answered Miss Sumpter; `it shows us the finite bounds of our being. The infinitive in space or time can be comprehended only by God!— Yet we feel sad that it marks our penetrating eye and flies still beyond our mental wing! How difficult to conceive space out-stretching there before us that has no bound! A centre without a circumference! When I suffer my thoughts to wander on such themes, I feel a sensation wholly indescribable. It is as if my soul were being annihilated.' `Such feelings are natural to all,' answered Duncan; and it is dangerous to let the mind cherish them. The attempt to measure the infinite is an impious assumption of Almighty attributes. It brings with it its own punishment. I knew a young man in college who loved to dwell upon such incomprehensible subjects, until over-tasking his mind in endeavoring to comprehend and trace to `the beginning' an unoriginated First Cause, he lost his reason and is now insane!' `Then let us not dwell on such themes! There is to me, I must confess, a strange fascination in those subjects, and I have felt as if I should go mad if I understood them not! But let us talk no more in this manner! Eternity is before us to learn and know all these things that perplex us here! Let us enjoy and appropriate that we can understand; and such is nature with its varied and glorious beauty! How mellow is all the air, and what a gentle influence is shed around us in this evening hour. The leaves stir in the idle breeze and seem to live; and the clouds sail like barks along the azure ocean; and the waves of the bay dance and tumble together as if they had life! And yonder white sail! how beautiful it decks the horizon like a sea bird resting on its wing!' `There is beauty enough on earth to fill the heart, Isabel, if the heart would open itself to receive it. There is no unhappiness, no evil but in ourselves! Nature ever looks and speaks kindly to us; and bids us forget our griefs and partake of her joys.' `Yes, God has done his part to secure our happiness here; and it only remains for us to do our part by accepting and enjoying what his bounty and love have bestowed! But not satisfied with His gifts we are ever inventing happiness for ourselves; which like all human inventions is, when done, mixed up with much evil. Yet we are so in love with our own works, that we love these ways we have sought out, better than those God has marked out for us. He who can truly love God's works is truly wise and happy!' `I am surprised, I must confess, Miss Sumpter, to find one so young converse so sensibly and thoughfully upon such subjects. I shall ever esteem it the happiest event of my life, the privilege of becoming acquainted with you.' `This assurance is most gratifying,' said the young man.' `I do indeed appreciate your noble and thoughtful character, and cannot feel too happy at the consciousness of being able to understand you. But, dear Isabel,'—here he checked his words as if he had forgotten himself, and, deeply blushing, said, confused and hurriedly,—`Pardon me, Miss Sumpter! I betrayed my deep interest in you without reflection. Forgive me! It was the impulse of the heart!—of a heart, permit me to say,' he continued, gathering confidence as he saw her sit with her eyes cast down, and her vesture heaving with emotion, `that is wholly yours!' He waited with a throbbing heart for a reply. She remained silent, but deeply agitated. He knelt by her and looked up into her face with a cheek pale with his intense feeling. He strove to read in the downcast look and changing cheek of the maiden, the answer to his hopes and fears! He took her hand. It lay passive in his own. He raised it to press it to his lips, and fearing to offend, let it fall; when, looking up, he met her eyes! They were full of a merry light, and a smile played roguishly about her sweet mouth. Instantly the solemnity and serious aspect his love had put on, vanished before the radiance of her sunny countenance, and smiling at his own fears, and with his heart bounding with hope and joy, he arose from his kneeling posture at her feet, and folded her to his heart. This was spoken with an earnestness so unusual to the young student, that Isabel fixed steadily upon him a moment her dark eyes; but meeting his own deep gaze, she turned them away, while she said with a richer hue on her cheek, and in a tone not wholly free from a slight tremor of feeling, `I cannot think you would say this, for the purpose of merely complimenting me, and feel grateful for your words. It is a pleasure to us all to know that we are regarded with kindness, and that our society, however indifferent it may be, contributes in any degree to the enjoyment of another. It is a happiness to feel that one is appreciated; and I feel that you appreciate me.' Thus love had silently but surely been growing up in the heart of the maiden, and in the hour of his confession her soul responded to his. Scarcely had the happy Duncan released the blushing, struggling girl, when a sound in the shrubbery close by the win dow caused them to assume a quiet composure which neither felt at such a moment. Belt, Howard's greyhound, the next moment bounded upon the lawn and leaped into the window. To conceal her confusion and her gladness at the consciousness of being loved by Duncan, Isabel bent over the beautiful animal to caress him. `Howard cannot be far off,' said Duncan, trying to affect indifference, which, after what had passed, he was far from doing successfully, if we may judge from his heightened color, and brilliant joy-dancing eyes; and as he spoke he removed his seat from the low taboret at her feet to a chair a little farther off. Howard at the next moment made his appearance with his double-barrelled gun in his hand, and a snow-white sea-gull dangling by the wing in his hand. `I thought I should find you here, sitting both of you like two mopes, when the free air, the free sky, and the free wide woods are all out doors! Here is a pretty gull I have shot for you, Isa bel, he said, standing in the window and holding it by its outspread pinions before her. It measures full four feet from tip to tip, and the wings will make a pretty ornament for your mantle-piece!' `What taste, Howard!' said Isabel laughing; `but it is very pretty. Poor bird! see the spot of blood on its snowy breast!' `That is where the buck shot hit him. I thought of you when I fired, or I should not have troubled him. I would, for myself, have sooner brought down a pigeon or duck. To-morrow I am going in my boat to the Hawk's Ledge, where there will be fine sport. I shall take my lines, as fish are plenty off the rocks.— Now I want you both to go! Duncan has been good for nothing since you have been sick, and now you are well you must pay for keeping him so much from me by going out yourself.' `It seems to me you are a very positive young gentleman, said Miss Sumpter with a smile as she gazed on his handsome countenance. `Suppose I decline going.' `I shall be very sorry, for I like you very much, and want you to enjoy yourself,' he said in a gentle, courteous tone that singularly contrasted his former bold, careless style of addressing her.— `It is a pity you and brother Duncan should be cooped up here all day, when there is so much to invite you abroad. Come, put yourself under my charge, Isabel, and I will be a beau worth half a dozen of my brother, there, who is laughing and wondering I can talk so freely with a handsome young lady, and call her Isabel, when he seems half afraid to raise his eyes to hers, though he'll sit in a chair two yards distant from her a whole day, as if he was watching a hare.' Here the eyes of Isabel and Duncan met, full of meaning; both blushed and smiled, and the former said playfully: `Well, Howard, I will go with you in the boat, provided you will make a sailor of me. But I insist, on the outset, you are not to make me climb cliffs after hawk's nests.' `No; but I will do it for you, and make you a present of a nest of young hawks, to bring home. Brother Duncan will perhaps try and find you a cooing dove's nest, also,' he said. `Would'nt you like one, Miss Isabel?' `You are as mischievous as you are—' `What?' he asked archly. `Handsome, I was going to say, but I won't.' Howard colored, and looked a little confused, and Duncan felt a pang from some unpleasant sensation that these few words awakened, dart through his bosom. The presence of Judge Sumpter, who at this moment rode up and alighted at the door, turned the conversation into other channels, and in a few moments the party retired from the window to tea.</field>

The young hunter and his dogs—The power of beauty—The wild tamed—The dangerous position of Isabel—The correspondence—The truth told in a letter—Two kinds of love —A dissertation thereon—Isabel defended—The gradual change in the character of Howard—The jealousy of Duncan —The discovery by Isabel of her own feelings—The decision—The result. After the confession of young Duncan, `the course of true love' ran smoothly for many days after, deepening and strengthening in both their hearts as it flowed. Both were happy in the consciousness of loving and being beloved. But Duncan's term of absence from the University rapidly drew to a close; and he looked forward with sadness to the arrival of the hour when he should be compelled to seperate from her, around whose heart the cords of his own life were firmly bound. The day at length came and tender and passionate and sorrowful was the farewell; for his absence was to be for a year. A winter and a summer was to elapse ere they should meet again. Absence only served to strengthen the passion of Duncan, and his letters to Isabel breathed the ardor of the purest and most elevated love. This devotion and sincerity met a warm return from her, and her replies breathed affection and tenderness, and were filled with pledges of constancy. But Miss Sumpter knew not her own heart. Duncan had been her first admirer, and love in her had grown from gratitude and pride. Yet it was love and true love! But the same causes still involved the power of creating the same effects. And this power was soon tested. After Duncan's absence, the youthful Howard became a frequent visiter at Judge Sumpter's. But it was from loneliness rather than any tender motive of which Isabel was the object. He generally came with his gun, and with his dogs at his heels, and usually called to her through the window, instead of entering the house. The Judge often was his companion in the forest after game, and sometimes Isabel also accompanied them. As Spring opened she became more frequently his companion; and he taught her to use the fowling piece and to manage a boat almost with skill equal to his own. Thrown so much into society Isabel insensibly took a delight in joining him in his daily excursions; till at length the Judge playfully reproved her for neglecting her harp for a shot-gun and loving the green forests better than the drawing room! And there was truth in the reproof; for so agreeable had Howard's companionship seemed to be, that she preferred a morning ramble with him by the sea-side, or through the forest glades, than remaining at home, where he would never remain a moment. Indeed, he scarcely ever entered the house. And had she not joined him out doors, she would rarely have seen him. The beauty, good humor and buoyant spirits of Miss Sumpter, had a charm for Howard, and he got so bewitched with her fascinating companionship, that he felt dull, and was indifferent to the game whenever he went abroad alone. At length there seemed to take place a great change in him; and instead of going into the forests for the love of the chase, it was apparent that he only went for the love of Isabel's society. This was clearly evident from the fact that of late, when she could not accompany him, he would himself deeline going, and, standing his gun by the side of the window, sit on its step with his feet upon the lawn, and pass the time with relating his hunting adventures, and listening to her stories of boarding school frolics. This change in the aspect of affairs took place in less than seven months after poor Duncan's departure. Howard was now past his nineteenth year, and as tall as his brother, and equally handsome. Indeed, Isabel, as she watched his countenance as he related some stirring incident of personal adventure, and marked his flashing dark eyes and his finely animated features, let the thought enter her mind that he was even handsomer than Duncan! Weeks past on, and Howard forgot when he came to bring his gun, to ask her to accompany him in his forest pastimes. He would sit by her and talk, and sometimes she would sing to him. He soon learned to love her songs better than those of the forest birds, and the tones of her harp were pleasanter to his ear than the music of the winds and of the waves dashing upon the beach. A gentler influence came over his soul. His voice grew gradually lower in its tone, and his manner subdued. He was no longer the reckless, rash, thoughtless boy of a few months back. He was tamed! and the power lay in that secret charm which is given to woman for the purpose of taming and subduing our fiercer natures. Miss Sumpter was the magician that had changed his nature. Yet, she knew it not! She was blind to her own involuntary work! She had not sought to win his heart, nor wished to lose to him her own! She had thought nothing about results. She liked his society, and was gratified when she found her influence over him was so great as to induce him to prefer an hour's quiet, thoughtful, conversation at home with her, to passing the morning in pursuit of game in the forests, or climbing cliffs for young hawks; or flying over the waves in his light skiff, pursuing sharks with his rifle! She did not foresee any danger in this intimacy. If any day he came not, she missed him more than she ought to have done; for she was restless and indifferent, and cared not to touch her harp and sing, if he could not be there to listen. Yet she was not, (at least she did not think of being,) false to the absent Duncan. Her letters to him were just as tender as ever, and as full of love and desires to see him, with warm expressions of anticipated happiness when he should return. Yet, oddly enough, (perhaps it was her sex's instinct,) she did not mention Howard, save in a line or a postscript, such as follows: `Your brother appears quite well, and we frequently see him:' or, `Howard was here yesterday for a few moments, and is looking finely; but seems to care less for hunting than he used to. But I suppose he often writes to you.' These postcripts should have been truly written in this way: `Howard is now here trying to learn a favorite air of mine on a guitar he has bought for himself, having of late taken a strange fancy for music. He has a fine voice, which I am cultivating for him; as he sings with me every piece I play. He passes most of the forenoons with me, and is a most entertaining companion. I could listen to him for hours. He has a fine taste for painting I discover, and some sketches he has made I have been colouring under his direction. We often walk out to the cliff at sun-set, in the path where you and I used to ramble so fondly together; and I think no young man could be a more delightful companion at such times. He has a taste for poetry, and has recently penned, and presented me a pretty poem on my adventure with the stag, and the tragic death of poor Antelope. I would write more, but am working a game bag for Howard, the pattern of which he has himself drawn; it represents a young hunter with his bow unstrung, his arrows broken, and his quiver cast aside, reclining at the feet of the Graces, who are crowning him with a wreath!' The reader will see from this true statement of affairs, that Isabel was in very great danger of proving traitorous to her troth pledged to Duncan. But this idea never entered her mind. She did not think of loving Howard. And in truth, to do her full justice, she regarded him more as a brother than as one who might steal her affections. She would not have been so intimate with any one but Duncan's brother. This she felt was the truth; and if ever any notion of impropriety entered her mind, she would meet it with this defence, and so acquit herself. But she knew not herself, and how dangerous it was for a betrothed maiden to cherish close friendship with a handsome youth, in the absence of the betrothed, even if the youth were his brother! And thus, with the delusive idea that it was no harm to teach Howard to sing, to work game-bags for him, and to feel very happy in his society, and unhappy out of it, because he was Duncan's brother, this beauteous erring girl, suffered herself imperceptibly to let her friendship silently deepen in her heart to love! `But, how can she love twice?' asks some fair one with surprise, Love is of a two-fold nature, and a two-fold origin, yet both are true! There is a love which is inspired by assiduous attentions, by tender devotion, by series of kindness, by expressions of admiration, and confessions of ardent attachment, from the lover; to all which the maiden is supposed to be, at first, indifferent but to the strength and steadiness of which she at length yields her heart, and loves in return because she is beloved. This is passive love, and it is the most common in the world; Its true name is gratified pride, at being made the exclusive object of admiration. This is an inferior aspect of love, with reference to woman. There is a love deeper and more pure and lasting. It is when, without any effort on the part of the man to win her affections, love silently steals into her bosom; and he discovers that he is a beloved object, ere he had by word or act made an effort to win! This kind of woman's love, is true love, and never perishes while the heart endures! The other is transplanted from the soil of the lover's heart to her own! this is the growth of her own rich heart; upsringing from roots that draw nourishment from the springs of her own being. It overgrows the other and ont roots it! It is a tree of life, bearing immortal fruit. The other is the love that terminates with time, and oftener in time, this is a love that transcends time, and is existant in eternity. The love of Isabel Sumpter for Duncan, sprung not from her own heart. It was the love of Duncan planted there, and growing from roots that had been first nourished in his own being. It was therefore, that his love was the deeper and purer! Yet she loved him as the world deems it, and the world is content to call this passively reflecting love, `love!' To most it is love. The majority of mankind know no other. When the true is awakened and begins to grow by the side of the other, then follow all the mischief of which the heart is the theatre and the player! What was the condition of Howard's heart, while the change was silently going on in the bosom of Isabel? Youths of Howard's age are sufficiently susceptible of impressions from the beautiful, among the other sex. But Howard was not so impressible with the tender passion as others! He was too light and volatile, to be easily subdued by bright eyes into a sighing lover. Yet he loved the society of Isabel more than that of any person in the world, and had no relish for any thing in which she did not participate. But his liking for her was rather that of a brother for a sister. His heart was not interested, and he would not have been jealous, if she had told him, (as she never had done) that she was engaged to his brother Duncan! Perhaps, however, a better idea can be obtained of the true state of Howard's feelings, in reference to Isabel, from the following extract of a letter addressed to his brother, a few weeks before the time when he was expected home, after his year's absence at College. `When you return, dear Duncan, we shall have much more of each other's society than before; for Isabel Sumpter has taught me to love in-door pursuits. Would you believe it! I can sit in a room with her a whole morning, without any wish to go out, shine the sun never so brightly. The other day when I was walking with her, `Belt' started a hare and instead of joining him in the chase, I called the dog away, because Isabel was talking, and I had rather listen to her. I think she has grown much more beautiful. Her step is just like a deer's! and every motion is as graceful as a fawn's! I think when you see her you will fall in love with her. I am sure I love her she is so very lively and entertaining always. I dont know what I should do without her, she is such clever company. She can shoot a rifle nearly as well as I can, and is a most accomplished fisherman, or fisherwoman, perhaps I ought to say. I am glad you are to take your degree and come home so soon. We shall have fine times! Father, says something about sending you to England; but I think you have got learning enough for one head! There are a great many things I dont know, that I find Isabel knows, but I get along very well; though sometimes, she condescends to enlighten my ignorance, at which times I am, she says, a very apt scholar. It is so pleasant to be taught by a pretty girl! You had better come home and be her pupil, than go any where else. Five words from her give me more insight into a thing than a whole book would do! You didn't have an opportunity in the little time you were here, of knowing her so well as I do, and I want you to see how she has improved in the year you have been absent. But I am engaged to ride with her to the cliff-head at five o'clock, and it is now half past four. So good bye.' Howard.' The reception of this letter filled Duncan's brain with all sorts of lover's jealous fancies. It troubled him sorely. He had, indeed, no proofs of Isabel's falsity; but there was proof that Howard was too intimate with her, for an absent lover to bear with perfect philosophy. That very day he had also received a letter from Isabel. It breathed the same tenderness and affection; at least he thought so when he read it. He now went to his desk and opened and read it again by the light of Howard's epistle. He now thought he discovered a coldness and stiffness in it, which had before escaped his observation. He examined it more jealously still, and picked many a flaw in it; till at last it seemed to him in every line to contain proof of her untruth. Such is jealousy. He answered Howard's letter, and never before had he written a letter to his brother with such difficulty. He wanted to be angry with him, but strove to write with his usual affection. He also wrote to Isabel. Here he found it more difficult to write with indifference. He felt like reproaching her; but reflection and fear of being unjust, withheld every expression of reproach as it rose to his pen. The letter was affectionate and kind; but the ardour and devotion which characterised his other letters was wanting in this; and he could not help it. He felt grieved, pained, restless. In a word he was jealous. Howard did not notice the slight change of manner in his brother's letter; for suspecting nothing, he searched for nothing in it. This was not the case with Isabel. Its new tone struck her at once. She saw his wounded heart in every line, disguised as it was. One sentence gave her the key to the whole, and awakened her to a review of her conduct. It was as follows: `I have received a letter from my father, in which he desires me to spend a year in Europe before I return home. I replied that I could not consent to go abroad without first paying a visit to Virginia. Need I say that you were alone in my thoughts! But since my reply was mailed to him, circumstances have occurred which have led me to change my mind. I shall, therefore, leave here direct for Europe. My absence you have by this time become accustomed to; and should my decision occasion any disappointment to you, the society of my brother Howard will no doubt, compensate for my absence, as it has, hitherto, served materially to alleviate it!' This last sentence Isabel-read over several times very thoughtfully, till she fully understood the feeling that dictated it. `Yes,' said she, with a deep blush of consciousness of giving him cause; `yes, Duncan is jealous of Howard, and doubts my faithfulness. Till this moment I never suspected that my acquaintance with Howard was improper, under my peculiar relations with Duncan. But I see it now. I have thought too much of him; and loved his society too much. Yet I truly love Duncan. I do not love Howard. I am sure I do not! I have never thought of such a thing; and certainly he has not! I think Duncan has no right to be jealous!' But notwithstanding her attempts to excuse herself, she could not but feel that her lover would have a right to feel some resentment if he knew all. `But does he know all?' she asked herself. `How can he know all?' And this self-questioning caused her deeply to blush; for it involved the fact that there was that which she did not desire should be known. This led her to reflect upon all her intimacies with Howard, and she was conscious that she should not be quite willing that he should have been witness to all the tender passages of words and looks, which had passed between them in a sisterly and brotherly way,' as she phrased it in her heart. She also was led to examine her feelings in relation to the handsome youth, with whom she was in the habit of such daily intimacy. The result was a confession in the depths of her own soul, that Howard was very dear to her. The more she examined herself the deeper and stronger she found were her feelings of tender regard, and at length the conviction flashed upon her mind that she loved him! She was startled at the idea and trembled with strangely mixed dread and happiness. She was seated by her window with Duncan's letter still open in her hand, as this conviction that she loved Howard, stood forth prominent in her mind. There was, shall we say it? joy in the thought; yet there was more alarm. She felt happy and sad together. She leaned her head upon the window and hid her face and thought long and painfully. Duncan's image seemed to rise before her, and with a visage of grief and sorrowful anger reproached her! Then would intervene the bright countenance of the noble Howard! The consciousness of her influence over his proud and independent spirit, and the hope that she was dear to him, with the conviction that she loved him, oh, as she had never loved his brother, dried her tears and filled her soul with peace. Yet she was not happy! She did not feel guilty. She reproved not herself. But she pitied Duncan; for she knew how much he loved her. She sympathised with the grief of his noble spirit, when he should learn that she loved Howard. `But he shall not know it,' said she, under an impulse of generous feeling. `Let the secret of my love be locked in my own bosom. Howard shall not know it. Duncan shall be happy in believing me true! I love him. I can love him as a wife. I can make him happy. He shall be happy. Howard I will forget, or remember only with sweet sad pleasure!' At this moment a light touch was laid upon her hand. She looked up and beheld Howard. `You are ill or sorrowful, dear Isabel,' he said, taking her hand, and then with a smile of gentle feeling parting the fallen hair back from her forehead. `Howard, I—I entreat you to leave me,' she cried pressing her hand upon her eyes, while her bosom heaved with strange, deep emotion. `Have I offended you, then?' he asked, starting back and gazing upon her with a look of surprise and embarrassment. `No—no!' she answered earnestly; `but, but, Howard, I feel that it is not—nay—I hardly know what to say! Will you leave me?' she asked imploringly. `Yes, Miss Isabel, if you command me,' he answered with increased surprise, and in a proud tone. `Now you are displeased! I have been too hasty—too indiscreet! Stay—go not from me with that cloud on your brow!' she cried, rising and detaining him. `Forgive me, Howard; but I am far from being well this morning.' And reseating herself, the poor girl buried her face in her hands, and burst into a flood of tears. `There is nothing for me to forgive you, my friend Isabel,' said Howard, tenderly bending over her. `I have been too hasty to take offence, and I myself need to be forgiven. I am sorry that you are ill.' Isabel made no answer. Her bosom was torn between love and duty. Each moment deepened the consciousness of her strong passion for Howard. As he bent over her, and his low, sympathetic voice fell upon her ear, she could not hide from her soul the deep joy his presence gave her, and she trembled the more. Duncan filled her thoughts; Howard filled her heart! Her being was torn by the conflict. She was bewildered and lost in the chaos of her feelings. `You seem deeply agitated, Isabel. Pray what has occurred?' he inquired with touching interest. `This is not illness so much of the body as of the mind. Have I offended you? I know I am often rash and thoughtless; but intentionally I would not wound your feelings. I would take my own life first. Have I been the cause?' `Yes. No, no! You have not offended me. Pray don't ask me. Do not be offended with me! but I must beg you to go! I feel sorrowful, and tears and solitude are better for me for a while.' `I will go; but, dear Isabel, I leave with you all my sympathy, whatever be the cause of your grief. If it will alleviate it at all, know that you have my deepest sympathy.' Never had Howard spoken so tenderly to her. Her tears had unfolded the tenderer emotions of his nature `I know it, Howard.' After gazing a moment upon her as she leaned her head upon her arm, her face half hid in curls, and her whole form heaving with the intensity of the struggle with herself, he turned away, feeling in his breast a gentle and kindly interest awakened for his lovely friend he had never before experienced. From this hour Howard's manner towards her was changed from what it had been. The next time he met her he found her calm She made no allusion to the past, nor did he. But his manner and the tone of his voice she noticed were singularly tender and gentle. His eye was softer and deeper in its expression as it lingered on her face and timidly sought, yet shrunk from, her own. His attentions were more delicate and touching; and she was not blind to a deeper meaning in his every word and look. She had, on the day of her interview with Howard, struggled long with herself, and the issue had been, not victory over her new love, but a generous determination to sacrifice it to her sense of duty to Duncan. She resolved to be passive in Howard's prosence, and in no instance to suffer her passion for him to grow.— She nobly determined to let it perish in her heart if her heart perished with it. This she might in time, with proper watchfulness over herself, have been successful in if the change we have spoken of had not come over the whole being of Howard. The tears of the lovely weeper had dissolved his youthful heart, and awakened in it all its sweet sympathies and manly sensibilities. He thought of her with gentle pity, which is akin to purest love. When next he met, these feelings showed themselves so apparently that she had not only her own love but his to combat with. And did she sorrow at the discovery that Howard loved? Did she shed tears at this fresh obstacle in the way of her duty to Duncan? No, oh no! The sweet conviction made her forget her resolutions, made her to forget Duncan; and filled her whole being with the most exquisite delight. `She was then loved in return,' was the happy thought that poured itself like a full fountain into her bosom. `Howard, dear Howard! my heart is all thine! Thou only art my soul's idol! Henceforth thou art the centre of my life's bliss! the sun around which, like a planet, I shall revolve in an ever circling orbit of light and love!' Such were her feelings while, three weeks afterwards, she leaned fondly upon Howard's arm, as they walked together in the embowered path by the cliff, and discoursed of love by the golden light of the autumn moon. At length the day approached when Duncan was looked for home; for when the hour he was to leave for Europe came close at hand he felt that he could not fulfil his intention and depart without seeing Isabel once more, and learning from her own lips her treachery to his love, reproach her for her perfidy, and leave her forever. He had therefore written that he should visit Virginia before quitting the country. This letter was to his parents and not to Isabel; who, too candid to write when her affections were transferred to another, she had left his last letters unanswered.— Yet in her heart she felt she loved Duncan no less; she but loved Howard more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">`When you return, dear Duncan, we shall have much more of each other's society than before; for Isabel Sumpter has taught me to love in-door pursuits. Would you believe it! I can sit in a room with her a whole morning, without any wish to go out, shine the sun never so brightly. The other day when I was walking with her, `Belt' started a hare and instead of joining him in the chase, I called the dog away, because Isabel was talking, and I had rather listen to her. I think she has grown much more beautiful. Her step is just like a deer's! and every motion is as graceful as a fawn's! I think when you see her you will fall in love with her. I am sure I love her she is so very lively and entertaining always. I dont know what I should do without her, she is such clever company. She can shoot a rifle nearly as well as I can, and is a most accomplished fisherman, or fisherwoman, perhaps I ought to say. I am glad you are to take your degree and come home so soon. We shall have fine times! Father, says something about sending you to England; but I think you have got learning enough for one head! There are a great many things I dont know, that I find Isabel knows, but I get along very well; though sometimes, she condescends to enlighten my ignorance, at which times I am, she says, a very apt scholar. It is so pleasant to be taught by a pretty girl! You had better come home and be her pupil, than go any where else. Five words from her give me more insight into a thing than a whole book would do! You didn't have an opportunity in the little time you were here, of knowing her so well as I do, and I want you to see how she has improved in the year you have been absent. But I am engaged to ride with her to the cliff-head at five o'clock, and it is now half past four. So good bye.' Howard.'</field>

A struggle between two-fold love—The arguments advanced by Isabel to exculpate herself—The delay of Duncan—The visit of Howard to Isabel—Their walk and the meeting with Duncan —The manner of Duncan towards her—His resolution— Hamilton Woodhall—The overheard conversation—The crisis. With this, and a part of the succeeding chapter, dear reader, we shall close our reminiscences of the more youthful years of our heroes and heroine, bringing the time up to the period of the second departure of the brig of war from the Road stead, when we shall resume our narrative on the sea, As the hour drew nigh when Duncan was expected to arrive, Isabel became restless and ill at case. She could not but painful ly reflect upon their plighted troth, and that she had been untrue to him who had been true to her, and whom she knew was coming home only to see her. She tried to convince herself that she still loved him, and that her deep passion for Howard was not incompatible with her troth to him! Her feelings were mixed and varying; and sorely was she perplexed. She felt she could regard Duncan as a dear friend, and welcome him as such; but she was conscious he would claim, as he deserved, all that love which she bestowed on his brother. But this she felt could never be given him. Howard had become her heart's idol. She had folded her life up in his, as the bud of a rose is folded within its cup. `Oh, that the dread meeting with him were past,' she said, as she seated herself by the harp to see if she could not drive her unpleasant thoughts away with music. It was the morning on which Duncan was expected at `Merton,' the seat of Gol. Dudley. Howard had not called that morning as usual, having detained himself to welcome his brother; whom he promised to bring over to see her as soon as he came. She would have forbidden this, but Howard said he knew his brother would wish first to hasten to her. Howard was yet ignorant of his brother's love for Isabel. He loved her with romantic ardor. All her deep, passionate love, he returned with idolatrous devotion. In her he found and adored all the graces of her sex. His emotions at the expectation of meeting Duncan were very different from her's. He wished his brother to know his happiness, that he might share his gentle sympathy. `How happy,' thought he, `will the knowledge of my happiness in Isabel's love, make him!' The morning passed by, and the noon, and yet Duncan did not arrive. Howard delayed no longer, but hastened to Judge Sumpter's, giving his brother up till the next day. Isabel had been all day in a state of painful suspense. She feared to meet her lover, yet wished the meeting passed. As hour after hour went by, she was a prey to a nervous anxiety which gave fevor to her pulse and cheek. `Am I gurlty, then, in loving Howard?' she asked herself, as she paced the drawing-room, listening and starting at every sound. `If I am guilty in loving the one, I am also in loving the other, and love is guilt! But love is not guilt. I loved Duncan, but I had not then known Howard, or I had not loved Duncan! He never had my heart. I thought he had, but I was in error. Howard has my heart, my life, my being! If it is not wrong to love, it is not wrong to love with all our nature. Nay, it is wrong not to love wholly. Duncan cannot complain! I gave him all I could then, and thought I gave him all. But if a new nature is awakened within me, a new love has sprung up in my heart which overgrows the other, shall I not cherish the last and noble love, even though the first perish! Should I be doing justice to myself to crush the nobler germ, and cherish the baser! Should I be just in bestowing upon Duncan the baser, when his love demands my better love, which he never awakened, and which never can be his! But into what a subtle maze of reasoning am I plunging! If that be love which I hold for dear Howard, then I have never loved Duncan. Let him, henceforth, be only as a brother to me; for as such I can love him. But how shall I tell him this? How shall I wound his noble and truthful heart, by telling him I love him not. My lips will refuse utterance! And need I tell him? Had I not best by manner, by degrees, show him that we can only be as friends! Oh, how strongly does duty urge me to sacrifice myself, and let him be happy in finding me his! But can I deceive him?' Here she suddenly stopped and listened to a footstep, with a throbbing heart. It was only a slave passing the window. `It was not he! How my heart palpitates! Yet, why should I condemn myself! I have not injured Duncan. In loving How ard I have only been true to my own nature! And how can I give up my love, my living love, for the shadow and form of it which went before? How can I cease to love Howard; or keeping still my troth to Duncan, love Howard without guilt. Oh, that I knew how to act! If Howard knew the truth; generous and noble as he is, I feel that he would at once fly me to give his brother place in my affections! Never would he stand between his brother and his happiness! If Howard knew all, I should lose him forever! How then shall I guard the secret, save by appearing to Duncan as ever, till events shall further guide me! This I will do. I will meet him with affection, for this I feel; for loving Howard should not make me love Duncan less! He shall have all the love he has ever had, for it is still his. Content with this, he may not discover a deeper love which is his brother's! I will meet him as he would wish me to, and let after circumstances govern my conduct. But my soul is sad! I feel heavy fore-thoughts of pending evil. Yet I know not how to act to avert it! List! There is Howard's step! He is alone!' `Dearest Isabel,' said the youth, as she met him at the window, tenderly pressing his lips to her hand, `I have come to relieve your anxiety; having waited so long for Duncan. `And he has not yet come?' `He is not yet arrived, and will not probably be here till morning, as it is now nearly sun-down.' Isabel felt relieved, and was glad in her heart that he had been delayed. `You look ill, Isabel,' he said kindly regarding her; `let us take a walk together on the cliff. The evening is pleasant, and the sun-set promises to be very fine!' She took his arm, and they proceeded to the cliff. For some time Isabel remained silent. She was very much distressed; for notwithstanding her decision she was still troubled. Her sense of duty, of honor, and of justice was correct and high-toned. She could not for a moment cherish the thought of hypocrisy or deceit. Yet she knew the truth would make Duncan, whom she still tenderly regarded, wretched; and her knowledge of Howard's character assured her that he, on knowing it, as he too must know it, would at once resign her to his brother, whatever might be the sacrifice. Thus she should lose both Duncan and Howard, and perish the victim of a two-fold love. What woman would not pause ere she made such a sacrifice? The sacrifice was not only of herself and her own love; but it would involve Duncan's happiness and Howard's love. It would be the wreck of three noble hearts!' `How happy I should be, dear Isabel, If brother was our companion in this walk,' said Howard, as they passed along the woodland avenue. `I am impatient to see him, to let him see how beautiful you have become! how changed since he saw you!' Isabel sighed as her heart echoed `how changed!' Howard's words also startled her. `Howard!' she said, with embarrassment; and stood still by an oak, beneath which was a rustic arm-chair. `Dearest Isabel!' he answered, looking at her face, and impassionedly seeking her glance which wasdown-cast: `I would rather you would not speak of me in terms of admiration, to your brother Duncan! `Why, Duncan I know would be delighted to hear you spoken of! He thinks, or used to think a great deal of you! I know he will like you very much, and feel that you will become greater friends than you were when he was here before!' `I fear not, Howard! But you must beware,' she added with attempt at playfulness, `that you do not praise me too high! Duncan is very susceptible!' Howard blushed and then said, smiling, `I should be very sorry if Duncan should get to love you just as I do, sweet Isabel!' `Then don't be instrumental in producing such a catastrophe. Speak of me only as a friend.' `Yet I love my dear brother so fondly,' continued Howard, pursuing the train of thoughts Isabel had interrupted, `But I could almost have wished he had loved you first!' Here both seated themselves on the rustic seat, beneath the dark shadows of the grove, through an opening in which the sea was visible. `Can you be so indifferent to me, then, as to utter a wish like this, Howard!' she asked in a tone of disappointment. `No, Isabel, dear! It is not that I do not love you with all my heart, for I do; but that I love Duncan so well that I could have been willing, ere I had known the bliss of loving you, he should first have known it!' `And if Duncan should love me now?' asked Isabel timidly, trembling for Howard's constancy. `Duncan is too good to try to steal your heart from me, my Bel!' he answered smiling, and pressing her gentle form to his heart. `But he might not know you loved me, Howard,' she said, her heart deeply and painfully interested in his conversation. `I shall tell him of it, for I know my happiness will increase his own!' `Oh, never, never!' she cried with such energy and distress that Howard started from the seat, and gazed upon her face by the dim twilight with surprise and astonishment. `Pardon me, dear Howard. I knew not what I said,' she added re-seating herself, and for a moment burying her face in her hands. `You are strangely agitated,' he said affectionately, as he marked the strong heaving of her bosom. `No, I am better. Howard!' `What, my Isabel!' `If you love me, name not to Duncan our—our intimacy!' `Nay—call it truly what it is, my sweet Bel! Call it by its right name, `love.' `Tell him not you love me! Dear as the knowledge of this fact is to my poor heart, I would not it should be known to others—at least at present. There was a secret hope in her heart that time and absence would cure Duncan's passion, and that all might yet be well. `If you wish it, I will not,' he said warmly. `Thank you, Howard. You are ever kind and good.' `What could I refuse you, Isabel.' `Here is a step coming along the path!' `It is Duncan!' cried Howard, as he saw his brother's form in the walk, relieved against the light of the sky and sea. `My brother, my dear brother! You are indeed welcome home!' he said, as he clasped him in his fraternal embrace and kissed his cheeks. `Can it be possible that this tall young man is the stripling I left,' thought Duncan, as he received and returned his embrace, kissing him in return. `How you have altered and grown! I should hardly have known you, brother!' he said to him in the full, glad tones of re-union. `There is one, also, you will be scarcely less welcome to, dear brother,' he said, leading him to the rustic bench where Isabel sat, unable to think or move. She would have met Duncan any where than there at that hour with Howard. Duncan approached her, and in the few steps he made towards the seat where she sat, his mind was distracted by a hundred thoughts! At one instant he felt like bowing coldly at a distance, and then conversing with Howard on indifferent subjects. At another he felt like rushing forward and folding her to his heart, with all the warmth of his heart's unchanging love. He had arrived half an hour before his sudden appearance, having been detained by an accident to the stage. On learning that Howard was at Judge Sumpter's he departed to see him, and also meet Isabel at the same time. He still had doubts of her constancy, and believed that his brother was his rival in her affections. This was however, only a suspicion. It had, nevertheless, made him very uneasy and unhappy, and as we have seen, had drawn from him cold letters to her. He had now come home to know the truth of his suspicions; to confirm or destroy them. His love for Isabel had met with no abatement. He was trembling with joy to clasp her to his bosom, and find his doubts were without foundation. It this state of mixed feeling between hope and fear, he was traversing the walk to the mansion of Judge Sumpter where Howard discovered his approach. The words of Howard, which informed him of the presence of Isabel, strengthened his hopes of her truth; notwithstanding, he felt a jealous pang shoot through his bosom, at meeting her at such an hour in his brother's company. It was too much like intruding upon two lovers! Isabel put an end to his indecision, by rising and meeting him ere he reached her. `Duncan, dear Duncan, I also welcome you back again,' she warmly said, extending her hand to him. The words, and the act, were alike impulsive and unstudied. She felt as she spoke. Her grasp of his hand was frank and kindly. The sight of him awakened, in a degree, her former feelings. His doubts were dispelled like mist before the sun. A beaming smile from a glad and grateful heart, illuminated his face; and he returned her greeting with tenderness and warmth, that showed her how that he, at least, remained unchanged. He felt that he had wronged her, and tried to laugh at himself for his jealousy of his brother; and seriously condemned himself for his suspicions of her truth. Isabel was greatly relieved, to find the dreaded meeting had come off so happily; and felt a lightness in her heart that made her very cheerful, as giving each brother an arm, she walked homeward. There was no need of explanation now, she felt. She had met Duncan as she ought to have done, and he was happy! Days passed on which, in their progress, gradually unfolded to Duncan what a first nor a second meeting with the parties could fully develope; that Isabel, though she might love him, also loved Howard! and that Howard betrayed his own reciprocating passion, in every word and look. The old suspicion slowly revived and was reluctantly received into his mind. It was made stronger by the communications of a dissipated young man of the neighbourhood, who had spent a fortune at races, and at the gaining table. His name was Hamilton Woodhall. He had made up his mind to try and repair his fortune by a union with the wealthy Miss Sumpter. He therefore called upon her, and made her acquaintance. He was already known to the brothers, whom he now daily visited. Through him Duncan learned the close intimacy between Howard and Isabel; for the spendthrift Woodhall, detected the passion of Duncan for her; and hoped by creating a rivalry between the brothers to profit by it. Duncan had not been ten days at home, before he was satisfied that he shared a divided heart; and also that his brother was ignorantly his rival in Isabel's affections. This discovery was made by accidentally overhearing a conversation between them, which proved to him that they were lovers. On making this discovery, Duncan's first emotions were those of resentment against both; but a little reflection, with the remembrance of some words of Howard's he had overheard, convinced him his brother knew not of his own attachment. But towards her, his bosom burned with anger! He felt that she had deceived him; and he resolved to accuse her of duplicity, and leave her never more to see her. But his pride came to his aid, and he resolved to leave home without any interview. But this determination was given up at the suggestions of his love for her, which would not suffer him to leave her, without an effort to restore his place in her heart. `And,' said he, at home in his own chamber, in which he had shut himself, to reflect upon the subject; `shall I make this attempt, and, if I succeed, wreck my brother's hopes, who, I have discovered is not less attached to her than I! But yet he cannot love as I have loved! She cannot love him as I have believed she has loved me! He is young and gay hearted, and this love is perhaps merely a romantic attachment. If my brother knew the truth he could forget her in a few days, and I feel that he would! He is capable of making any sacrifice for me, or any one that he loves! But if, to save me from unhappines, he would willingly resign his love, would it not make her unhappy, if her heart is set upon him! I feel my own peace is dependant upon recovering her affections! She is kind; she is gentle; she is friendly; nay, she is even affectionate to me. Yet what is all this, when I know her heart is not wholly mine. I am torn with conflicting feelings, and know not how to act!' Such was the trial in Duncan's generous and true nature. He loved his brother—he loved Isabel too well, to desire even his own peace and happiness at the expense of their own. He loved her even in her inconstancy, too much to purchase her constancy at the risk of Howard's unhappiness. Before he acted he resolved to study them both, unobserved; and then, if he found them deeply attached to each other, so that disseverance would produce pain, he nobly resolved to leave them his blessing, and fly his home, though he carried a crushed heart with him. It was the evening of the day on which he made this noble, self-sacrificing resolution, that we have introduced him to the reader, in the third Chapter, as witnessing a tender interview between Howard and Isabel. This scene between the lovers, he felt sealed his own destiny. Howard, and not himself had her heart. Painful as this conviction was, he resolved to resign her, if she confessed the preference. It was, proper, before he did so, that he should formally restore her pledged troth! He lingered in the walk, until Howard departed; and as he witnessed the tender looks with which they parted, he felt feelings of jealousy rise in his heart against his brother, which he could not resist. He also felt against her, deep displeasure. He had said he would not entertain such feeling's, but bless them in their loves. But he forgot that he was human; and that the heart of man in love, is not always under his own government. When Duncan entered the drawing-room, Isabel was seated thoughtfully were Howard had parted from her, her hand listlessly laid upon her harp. She was thinking pleasantly and tenderly of him. Duncan was not in all her thoughts. Since his return, her manner towards him had been unusually kind and cordial. She strove to please him, and to atone by attentions, for the involuntary treachery of her heart. Her voice when she spoke to him, wae characterised by a tone of sympathy, as if she grieved in her heart for the heavy disappointment which she knew he must sooner or later suffer. She pitied him; and this feeling cast a gentle shadow over all her manner. It touched him, and he thought and hoped, it was the gentleness of love. But when he observed her manner, the tone of her voice and the glance of her eye when she spoke with Howard, he felt, with bitterness at his heart, that that was love and not the other! She looked up, and seeing him when he entered, appeared very much confused. `Do not rise, Isabel,' he said, taking her hand and reseating her, and occupying the place by her side which his brother had recently vacated. `I will not detain you long. I have come to say that this hand, which I feel I am unworthy of, but which you once did me the honor to pledge to me, with, as I then believed, your heart in it, I now surrender to you.' And he laid her hand down. `From this hour I will try to forget you. To-morrow or next day I take my departure for Europe. May you be happy with Howard, should you ever become his wife. He is every way worthy of you. As for me, I shall not expect any more happiness in this world. I have no more fountains of affection in my heart to unseal, to let their waters run to waste. Pardon me, if I seem severe! I do not feel so. Now receive my last advice, Isabel!' he said, rising, and taking up her passive hand. `But before I say the last word farewell, I would have you answer me one question?' He looked at her steadily and calmly as he spoke. It cost him a great effort to seem so. During his address she sat silent and immoveable as a statue. Her face was pale as marble, and the tears trickled from her eyes like rain. He silently observed her a moment, and his heart yearned towards her. But he restrained his feelings. He felt that she was no longer his own! `The question I would put you is this?' he said, in an even tone. `Does my brother know of our plighted troth?' `No—oh no!' she cried, covering her face, while the tears forced their way through her fingers. `I am relieved by this answer, greatly relieved,' he said, with emotion. `Howard is still my dear brother! Now, farewell, dear Isabel! That you may be happy shall be my daily prayer!' He turned and was leaving the apartment, when she arose and, flying towards him, caught his hand and sunk at his feet. `Forgive me! forgive me! Say that you forgive me, Duncan!' `I do, Isabel! But,' he added, in a tone that chilled her, `only for my brother Howard's sake!' `Duncan, oh, if you knew my poor heart! But its struggles you can never know. You are dear, very dear, to me! I love you, I have not ceased to love you! But I had not known Howard, or I should have known my heart better, when I fondly believed it was all yours! I love not you less, but Howard more! Hate me not for what I cannot help! Be still my friend—oh, if not for my sake, for Howard's!' `Isabel, I am your friend,' he said, lifting her to her feet. `You are dear to me! I think I can understand your conflict, and believe I know all you would tell me! My loss is Howard's gain! But one more question rises to my lips.' `Speak, Duncan,' she said, standing passively, looking the personification of sorrow, by his side. `I would ask if you had never known Howard, if I still should have retained the first place in your affections? Does not the cause lie in me?' `No. You are noble and good! I, alone, am the unworthy! Yes, Duncan! You would have still held the throne of my heart but for him who has taught me that I had a heart within that I offered you.' The brow of Duncan grew dark, and he looked displeased at her words. He walked across the room, and then returned to her, where she stood trembling like a statue. Both were so taken up with the subject in which they were so deeply interested, that they did not discover the presence of a third person. This was Hamilton Woodhall, who had entered by the hall door unannounced; not that his intimacy at the house had by any means warranted this familiarity; but, knowing himself not to be a favorite of Miss Sumpter's, and being naturally of a reckless, head-strong character, he resolved to forestall a denial to see him. He came in very softly—a mode of entrance peculiar to the stealthy and suspicious. The conversation interested him, and it was like him to remain unobserved and listen to it; and to do him justice, he was a very attentive listener. There was still another person who appeared, a moment after Woodhall's entrance by the hall door, at the lawn window. He was a very different character from this young man, however. It was Howard, who had returned, after leaving, to restore to her a pet rabbit he had given her, which he had found wandering far from the house on the skirts of the forest; and perhaps to say and receive another tender `good night.' He also was an involuntary auditor of their conversation. Again Duncan advanced towards her and said, in a tone of deep feeling: `One more question, dear Isabel!' She trembled, but said with a painful exertion of the voice for utterance, `name it, Duncan!' `If Howard were not living, (which heaven forfend!) would your love be mine!' `All the love I ever knew for you would then be yours, Duncan,' she said, feeling a strange fear paralyze her heart at his singular words. `Enough! I ask not for more than that! If a deeper love lay in the grave with Howard, then let it lay, so thou wouldst be mine on earth, and surrender to me all thy earthly affections. If Howard were dead, and thou wert my wife, I would still let thee love him with thy more spiritual love, so I had thy true affections. This reply has strengthened me. I know by it that I am still dear to thee, and that thou lovest me, but lovest my brother better! May you be happy together, and may he long live to enjoy that better love which the depths of my own true love, alas, could never move in thy soul! Now fare thee well, Isabel, and God bless thee and my brother!' With these words Duncan pressed his lips to her hand and sprang from the window upon the lawn. His eyes were blinded by tears, and he did not see his brother, whom he almost touched as he brushed past him. Isabel stood a moment as if stupified with surprise and grief, and then uttering a sad, wild cry, she fell senseless her length upon the floor. Howard, however, saw it not. He had hastened after his brother, who had gone at great speed towards the cliff along the path homeward. The fall and the shriek brought Judge Sumpter from his library on the opposite side of the hall, and the house-keeper and servants. But Hamilton Woodhall had her already in his arms, conveying her to a sofa, when they entered. `It was some difficulty or quarrel, Judge, with that haughty fellow, Duncan Dudley! They were at high words as I came in, when I saw him abruptly quit her, and she fainted and fell,' was the artful reply of Woodhall to the hurried inquiries of Judge Sumpter. The Judge, without replying, relieved him of his charge, and taking his daughter in his arms, bore her to her chamber, where she in a short time revived. Hamilton Woodhall, after lingering a while, and finding himself unthought of, left the house, muttering his displeasure at the Judge's want of hospitality. When she revived, to her father's questions she said earnestly: `Ask me not to explain, dear father. I cannot.' `Has Duncan Dudley insulted you?' `No; oh no!' `Young Woodhall says you were quarrelling, and he left you in anger.' `I cannot explain now, sir! some other time, perhaps, dear father, I may confide all to you. Let me exculpate Duncan. He has done nothing. Oh, no! he is good and noble. I have been the erring one.' The Judge was too sensible a man to urge her further; and referring the cause of her shriek and fainting to some love misunderstanding between her and young Dudley, (for he suspected their attachment,) which her affections led her to conceal even though Duncan were to blame, he left her to the quiet and repose she so much needed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. Howard discovers his brother on the cliff—Duncan's struggle with himself—Their interview—They return home together and part for the night—Howard's subsequent proceedings—The lock of hair and leave-taking—His parting with Isabel—The water side—He swims toward the fleet—The adverse current —His landing and fatigue—His final success—The brig —Arrival in the Mediterranean—The pursuit—Taken prisoner. As soon as Howard recovered from his surprise at what he had heard and seen, he started in pursuit of his brother, who he believed contemplated some act of self-destruction. Duncan was already out of sight, but he could hear his swift, strong tread falling among the broken twigs and autumn leaves of the forest. He had no time to ask himself what he was to say to him, or to reflect properly on the astounding discovery he had made of his brother's love for Isabel! The feelings that agitated his bosom were painful in the extreme. He condemned himself, censured Isabel, and pitied his brother. The next moment he reversed these sentiments. His mind was a chaos of the wildest thoughts. He knew not what to think or how to act. But his generous nature was uppermost, and he internally resolved that he would sacrifice himself, if need were, to his brother's happiness. But surprise at his discovery more than all else, filled his mind as he hurried on in the pursuit. To what end the pursuit? He knew not himself, save that Duncan was unhappy, and he wished to comfort him. The unhappy lover, in the meanwhile, flew along the forest glades, amid which he had, in happier hours, walked with her from whom he now fled. He paused not to reflect until he reached that portion of the path which traversed the brow of the cliff and gave an open view of the bay. Here he paused and bared his head and threw back the hair from his feverish temples, and seemed to gasp for the free cool air from the sea. It was star-light, save in the west where the roseate hues of the sun-set still lingered. A gentle breeze came landward and cooled his brow. The waves broke musicallly and with a soothing sound at his feet. Half a league distant were faintly visible the dark outlines of the three frigates and brig of war, comprising the Tripolitan squadron, anchored and ready for sea. The lights from each and from the numerous merchantmen anchored farther below, danced fitfully and brightly across the mottled water, and gave brilliancy and novelty to the scene. He stood a few moments and the influence of the quiet scene had its effect upon his mind. He thought calmly and reflected with reason. `Yes, I see how it is. Isabel loves him. She misunderstood the character of her feelings when she thought her sentiments towards me were love. My brother Howard has been the happy one to teach her what the true love of the heart is! Yet, nevertheless, I loved her, and love her still, for all that she loved me not with all her being. Did she love me as she loves Howard, I could love her no more than now. Oh, luckless hour that my brother came in the way of my happiness, and unwittingly dashed the cup of my bliss to the earth. He knows not what mischief he has done. Had he not loved her she would still love me as much as I would ask her to love me. He cannot love her, he cannot adore her as I have done. Nay—and why should he not? His nature is full of kindly feelings, and his heart is charged full with the best affections. It only remains for me to let them both be happy. I will in a day or two leave for Europe. I will not see her again. I will try and forget her in my absence, and try and pray for the happiness of both. She has made me happy—she has atoned to my pride by confessing that but for Howard she would still have been, and believed herself to be wholly mine. Nay—she even said if my brother were not living (Heaven preserve him in a long and happy life!) she could be mine. Oh, blest thought! sweet solace to my wounded love!— This is as if she were mine in heart, for my brother can never hold in my idea the place of a rival! Let him take her, so she loves me also He is the brother of my soul, and I can make even this sacrifice for him. To-morrow I leave for Europe.' `Nay, brother, my noble injured brother,' cried Howard, whose approach he had not regarded; `nay, this must not be so. Forgive me what I have done. I knew not the truth, or I would have drowned myself in the sea ere I would have been the guilty wretch I must seem to you. Forgive me, brother.' And Howard caught his brother's hand and threw himself at his feet in tears. `Generous and noble ever, my beloved brother!' cried Duncan, raising him from the ground and folding him to his heart. `Thou hast no need to ask forgiveness at my hands. But what dost thou know?' `Say thou wilt pardon me, Duncan. I have by accident overheard thy parting conversation with Miss Sumpter. I know all! She was thine—betrothed to thee ere I ever thought of love.' `And yet thou lovest her with all thy being, brother! I have seen this. I know it! She cannot love me now. She never loved me, but deceived by her heart, believed she did. She knew not love save by name till she saw you!' said Duncan bitterly. `Brother, hear me! I pray you listen kindly;' said Howard with fervor and much feeling. `Nay, thou lovest her, and she loves thee. I have made up my resolution to go to Europe to-morrow. She is worthy of thee, and thou art her peer in all things. God bless you both!' With these words, spoken with deep emotion, and interrupted by strong efforts to suppress the heaving of his laboring heart, Duncan turned and walked away, with his face buried in his hands. `Duncan, brother!' said Howard, laying his hand affectionately upon his arm, and speaking in a tone of great firmness and earnestness; `if you love me, stop and listen to what I have to say. You love Isabel Sumpter, still, with all your soul. She loves thee still. Nay—I know it! Her words—her manner—her very looks betrayed it to-night. Do not speak yet. I only stand between her and her former love for you. She confessed to you if I were not living her heart would fly back to you! You are satisfied with her love as it once was, though it may not be of the romantic character she entertains towards me. Indeed, I question, if she hath loved me, save idly, till you returned!' `Herein you do yourself injustice, brother, to make me think your sacrifice less,' answered Duncan. `I am satisfied of her love for you.' `But I do not love her—at least,' he said quickly, `so fondly that I cannot give her up to my brother. I love my brother most!' `Howard! I will confess that my life's happiness is wrapped up in Miss Sumpter. But she loves me not. You are her heart's chosen one! To you I surrender her! I love you, not more than her! but more than myself, and can make this sacrifice to you. Take her and be happy, both of you. Now let us speak no more of it!' he added, evidently with a painful effort to speak with cheerfulness. They walked along the cliff together for some moments arm in arm, Howard's face silently turned in the direction of the lights of the squadron sparkling over the waves, and Duncan with his eyes musingly fixed upon the ground At length Howard stopped full, and spoke with extraordinary energy. `Brother!' `Howard!' `If by any chance I no longer stood between you and Isa— Miss Sumpter, would you take back her heart, with only its old love for you, letting her keep the residue buried in her heart's depths for my memory's sake. In plain words should I die to night, would you still be happy in her love, if she would in time return to you?' `Heaven in mercy prevent the contingency, and long preserve your life, my dear brother! But, I frankly answer, for frankly you have put the question, I would!' `And do you think her love would flow back into its former channels in your bosom?' `I do. But why these questions?' Howard made no reply for a moment, and thus said, in a low half tone, as if uttering aloud his thoughts, `And that it would flow back, I know from her own confession this evening to him. It would not flow with all its deep waters of love,' he added tenderly; `for there would still remain at the bottom of her soul the fathomless still fountain, in the calm eternal depths of which I know my own image to be reflected!' Duncan was lost in his own thoughts, and did not hear or heed his words. At length Howard spoke out: `Brother!' `Howard!' answered Duncan, starting at the abruptness of the address. `Be happy! I have resolved to give up my love for Isabel, for I confess I love her as deeply as I am capable of loving, to my love for thee! I will not be made happy at your expense. I am younger and more buoyant of spirit, and can forget easier than you can. At least to resign her will not sink so deep into my soul as into thine. If I am out of the way she will love thee in my stead, and you will be happy with her. You will cause her to forget me. I have therefore decided to leave home at once, and not return till you are husband and wife. Absence will work its own cure in her affections, and you will be happy!' `Never, brother, shall you make this sacrifice,' cried Duncan, in a spirit of generous enthusiasm. `She loves you most, and your own happiness is as much enlisted in her as my own. Shall I be so selfish then, as to secure my own happiness at the expense of yours! No, my noble Howard! The sacrifice shall be mine! She will regard my absence less than thine—nay she would forget me in the light of thy love! Thee she would never forget while thou wert living, nor cease to hope for thy return! No, Howard! The die is cast! I go away and leave thee to the love and happiness which fate has denied to me!' `Brother!' `Do not urge me, Howard! My mind is made up! The decision is a painful one, but it may not be revoked. The day after to-morrow I leave for Europe!' The brothers stood together a moment in silenc, both gazing seaward, but with absent looks, when Howard suddenly said, `Promise me, Duncan, that you will wait one week before you proceed to fulfill your intentions!' `The sooner I leave the scenes that continually remind me of Isabel, the better it will be for me,' he answered with melancholy. `Yet promise me what I wish, brother! I have a reason deeply involving your happiness, in asking it. `I promise then to delay my departure a week, but on the condition you pledge me your honor, Howard, that in the interval, you will not make any effort to influence the mind or feelings of Miss Sumpter in my behalf!' `I cheerfully give you the pledge you wish, Duncan,' answered Howard. `Now let us change the subject. How beautiful the effect of the numerous changing lights from the vessels in the Roads, as they flash out or glimmer along the water! I wish, instead of idling at home here, I had been attached to our infant navy. I burn with ambition to distinguish myself in the war with Tropoli; and wish I was now on board yonder fleet. I love the sea; and the bay has been as much my home as the forests here!' `And I have always thought I should like the sea,' answered Duncan. `You know before I went to college, application was made by father for a midshipman's warrant for me, which was denied by the party in power, because he had taken no part in the Revolution, and was suspected of Toryism. If I could now get it, under this administration, I would accept it to-morrow and sail in this fleet! I will have my father write to Washington city to-morrow!' he concluded with animation. `I want action!' The young men walked together homeward, conversing on various subjects, and affectionately parted for the night. Howard went to his chamber and taking from a drawer a lock of hair, and one or two trinkets (gifts of love) from Isabel, and pressing them to his lips with affectionate tenderness, he placed them in a locket which he bound close to his heart. He then waited until the house was still, and then stole softly to the apartment of his parents, both of whom he kissed tenderly while they slept and bade them farewell! He then sought his brother's chamber, whom he found in fitful sleep, often murmuring the name of Isabel He stood and gazed on his fevered brow a moment, and then leaving a fraternal kiss there, softly left the room. He then took his way silently from the house and walked rapidly in the direction of the cliff. Here he lingered a moment and fixed his eye on the indistinctly seen squadron in the Roads. `Yonder lies my way!' he said in a decided tone. `The fleet sails not without me! Now, Isabel, one farewell to thee!' `He took his way to the mansion by the path through the woodlands. All was repose around. He well knew the casement of her room and he stole beneath it! It was closed and a faint light shone through the blinds. He listened all was still. At this moment the wind gently swung back the blind. She was asleep but pale! He saw her lips move and knew his name was murmured. A negro woman was seated by her bedside sleepily, or quite asleep, waving to and fro above her young mistress's head a plume of peacock feathers. He obeyed the impulse of his nature and entered. He stood a moment bending over her as she slept. It was like the calm repose of an infant. He knelt by her side and kissed her brow and lips. He then rose and said `farewell, Isabel! I leave thee, but I can never forget thee! Be happy thee and Duncan! for great is the sacrifice I make!' He again kissed her and was turning away when he heard her articulate his name. He looked back; but she still slept, and he knew that she dreamt of him, and his soul was both happy and sad! From the house he took his way to the beach and soon arrived at a fisherman's cabin, which stood in a secluded spot under the brow of the precipice and near the gorge from which the stag had emerged when pursued by Isabel and her father. The cabin was silent, and after he had knocked several times he was satisfied it was untenanted. “Paul has gone out to fish! But why do I wish to see him! What I do must be done with secrecy and without a confidant! I will find a skiff somewhere on the beach and go out myself! But the absence of the skiff will betray my destination. She must believe me dead! I will take no boat, but swim out to the nighest vessel, which is not more than a mile and a quarter!' He had no sooner come to this determination, than with the impulsive decision of his character, he hastened to a rocky ledge, which extended a little way into the sea, from whence, after divesting himself of his outer clothing, he fearlessly cast himself into the waves. With a strong arm and a determined spirit he struck out towards the anchored fleet, and for sometime made rapid headway. But he soon fell into a current setting strongly out from the river which carried him far to leeward of the fleet, which he soon found, with his most streneous efforts, he should be unable to reach. He therefore, being greatly fatigued by his exertions, suffered himself to float, borne by the current in the direction of a promontary a league eastward of the point from whence he had started. Here he landed just at day break, having been five hours in the water, so overcome with fatigue, weariness and disappointment, that he threw himself down in a nook in the rocky shore and fell asleep. When he awoke it was with a sensation of freshness and vigor, that showed him he must have slept a long time; and on rising and looking round, he saw that it was near the afternoon. With a sinking of the heart, he glanced in the direction of the Road, and to his confusion and surprise, not a vessel remained at the anchorage. He hastened to the summit of the headland, and turned his eyes seaward, in which direction he beheld just on the verge of the horizon, two or three of the slowest sailers of the fleet! He uttered an exclamation of the keenest disappointment, and was inflicting upon himself the severest censure, when his eyes fell on a vessel northward, slowly standing down towards the coast. He watched this sail with intense interest for more than an hour, and was satisfied that it was the brig of war which had been attached to the Tripolitan Squadron. This discovery gave him new hope; and as the brig seemed to be standing off and on, as if waiting for communication with some part of the shore to the west of him, he resolved to make an attempt to get on board of her. About five o'clock he saw her come to a league above him, and he determined to reach her before night, if it was in the power of man to do it. There was no boat any where within sight, and he traversed the beach a mile eastward, without discovering one. He retraced his steps, and proceeded along the coast towards his own house, until fearful of being discovered, he hid himself and resolved to wait till dark, and then calculating for the current, go above her and swim off, and reach her, or perish in the attempt. While he was watching her from his covert, he saw her fire a gun, and soon afterwards the boat put off and return with the Consul. He then saw her square away, and stand down along the shore. `Now I can reach her, if I make my calculations correctly for the drift of the current,' he said with animation. As he flew towards the water, he picked up a paddle, which he retained to help him in swimming. On the beach he found a heavy plank, which had drifted there. `This with the paddle will be all I shall want,' he said with delight. `It will give me height out of the water at least, and I shall be seen by them if I can get nearer!' He then launched the plank which just supported his weight, and paddled himself on this frail vessel boldly out into the bay, so as to intersect the course of the brig, which was slowly drifting, their being not wind enough to fill her royals. Before he reached her, however, the wind rose, as we have seen, and the vessel began rapidly to glide away from his grasp. But his final success in getting on board, has been witnessed by us all. The sacrifices thus generously made and persevered in by this noble hearted young man, cannot be too highly regarded! It was perfect in its plan, and complete in its results. No obstacle defeated it! no delay or disappointment or danger, prevented him from carrying it into effect. Yet he loved her he thus fled from, no less than Duncan loved her. But his love for his brother, his desire for his happiness, united with a feeling of injustice towards him in unintentionally stealing from him Miss Sumpter's heart, inspired him to this step, and gave him resolution to go through with. All he now wished was, that he might be supposed to be drowned. He felt pain at the idea of the grief with which such an idea must overwhelm Isabel, and in imagination, saw her weep inconsolably for his loss. But he cheered himself with the reflection that time would soon heal her sorrow, and that her recusant heart would return to its first attachment, and that she would be happy, and restore happiness to the bosom of his brother. And with a manly resolve, to try and think of her henceforth only as his brother's wife, he set himself to his duty on board. The course before him, he cared not what it might be, so that it were adventures and full of action. He was not reckless, and did not feal so; for the act which had then cast him upon the world, was his own, and performed for the noblest end, and with the noblest purpose! He did not wish his name or family known, and therefore gave the name of Howard only to the Captain of the Brig. His whole aim was to be so lost to all his friends search, that he should be believed to be dead—so that the only obstacle to his brother's happiness might be removed. He did not intend, however, to remain a common seaman, longer than the fleet should get into active service, when he felt he could come his own way to distinction. The brig, the third day out overhauled the fleet, and the Consul was placed on board the flag-ship. On the first of July the squadron reached Gibraltar, and in a few days afterwards dispersed on different cruising grounds; while the President frigate and the brig of war, sailed for Tripoli, off which port the former made her appearance towards the last of August. In the meanwhile the brig had fallen in with a Tropolitan cruiser of fourteen guns, and after a close action, within pistol shot, compelled her to strike. During this engagement, Howard's bravery and gallant conduct, were so conspicuous as to draw from the Captain, a public expression of praise. The armament of the prize was thrown overboard, and the vessel given up to the Tripolitans, as the instructions of the commander of the brig would not permit him to send her into port. The brig then kept on her way towards Malta. The following evening just at sun-down, as she was running down within two leagues of the coast, under a light wind from the South West, a polacca schooner was discovered creeping along close under the land, in the direction of Tripoli. Captain Sterret immediately made sail in chase, and as night set in, had drawn so near as to be able to discover her to be a Tripolitan. As the wind was light and a strong current was setting off the land, he found he should have to give up the chase, as the polacca was propelled along by sweeps, or else attack her in his boats. This he finally resolved to do. The first and second cutters, and the launch were immediately manned and despatched in shore in pursuit. A low neck of land with here and there a group of date-trees, upon it stretched along for several miles, with a rocky beach. Towards this and into a sort of inlet making up the land, the polacca was rapidly pulling. The first cutter took the lead and pulled steadily in, until the increase of darkness rendered the polacca no longer visible. But by listening, the heavy dash of her banks of oars could be heard about a mile distant. This encouraged the pursuing party, and with renewed vigor they pressed on in the chase. At length the moon rose like a large shield of bronze from the sea, and flung her golden light over land and water. By her light, they discovered the polacca making her way up an inlet which was separated from them by a ledge of black rocks. The entrance was, after some difficulty discovered, and the boats dashed boldly through. The inlet was small and on the side to the sea, defended by a cliff of great height, which flung a dark shadow half over its surface. The commander of the boats detained them in the entrance of this deep, dark gorge, till he could survey its character and the position of the polacca, which seemed to be anchored not five hundred yards distant close in with the shore. With his glass he discovered that she was moored close to the rocks, and that her decks were crowded with men. On the heights back he discovered what seemed to be lines of walls, and the barricaded outlines of old Moorish houses, with two or three tall palms towering above. After having made his observations, he gave the order to advance and board! Simultaneously, with one movement, the armed boats shot forward, and were soon within pistol shot of the polacre, when those on board, after hurriedly and without effect discharging their firearms took to the water and swam to the land, while those on board the launch and first cutter poured in and took possession. The second cutter, in which Howard pulled an oar, and which was commanded by a midshipman, seeing the polacca captured, pulled across her stern directly for the land. `Way enough,' he cried, and the bows struck the beach. He sprung out, followed by his crew, armed with pistols and sabres, and followed up the hill in chase of the flying enemy. Howard was foremost in the pursuit, and his eagerness carried him far beyond the rest, who had been commanded to return to their boats by an order from the captain. But he had got sight of a gorgeously dressed Tripolitan, who had been watching from behind a rock the fate of his vessel, and whom his approach had started to flight. Supposing him to be the captain, Howard was anxious to pursue and capture him. He therefore was heedless of the recall, and dashed up the hill after him at full speed, with his drawn cutlass in his hand. He saw him disappear on the summit in a sort of walled enclosure, into which he fearlessly followed him. It was a ruin. There were no gates to the entrance, and the moonlight streamed in through numerous windows upon the brick pavement. In the midst was a ruined fountain, and around were galleries fallen into decay. It was evidently a deserted Tripolitan castle, the sea villa of some powerful Dey. He lost sight of the fugitive in the deep shadows of the ruins, and was standing deliberating which way to advance, when the man he was seeking, seeing he was alone, suddenly reappeared from a recess, and attacked him with a scymeter. Howard, though taken by surprise, defended himself with great bravery, and more than once forced his antagonist, who was a splendid swordsman, to retreat to the wall of the ruin. But the clash of swords drew another man to the spot, when Howard, severely wounded and overpowered by numbers, was compelled to yield. He would have been slain upon the spot by the new comer, but for the interposition of his antagonist, who, impressed by his youth and gallantry, commanded him to save his life. `You are brave, and you shall live,' he said to him in French, with which Howard had been familiar from his nursery. `Ha! they have fired your polacca, Rais,' he said to the man, a short, fierce looking Moor. Your sea-cruisers are never safe. I will ne'er trust another, while I can stride a horse. A good steed is your only safety! Come, let us to the top of the ruin and see her burn! The sight will perhaps help your philosophy.' The Rais, or captain of the polacca, frowned, and fiercely curling his mustache, turned on his heel and left the ruin; while the other, bidding Howard follow him, walked to a spot whence a view of the scene could be obtained. The atmosphere around grew more lurid each moment, and at length they saw the cruiser beneath them enveloped in flames, which shot up her masts and wreathed themselves about the spars like serpents. The light shone far and wide, and the brig was plainly seen lying to outside. The boats of the brig were all visible to Howard, drawn at a little distance off from her, but half a mile from him, the men lying on their oars, watching the spectacle. In a few moments she exploded, and filled the air with blazing fragments. The concussion was felt at the ruin. The water around her was for an instant or two dotted with blazing wood or cordage, and then all disappeared in darkness, leaving the moon once more her empire of the night. Suddenly the silence was broken by a loud shout from the Americans! Having given nine cheers, they once more bent to their oars and the three boats pulled out of the inlet to regain the brig.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. The breakfast—Howard's disappearance—The conjectures— Duncan's suspicions—He proceeds towards the cliff—He meets with Hamilton Woodhall—Their quarrel—The fruitlessness of the search—The general alarm—The effect upon Isabel— The discovery made by Woodhall—The gull, and Woodhall's fiendish scheme to ruin Dancan—His return, and the effect upon those present. We shall now return to Duncan, and to the events which followed the sudden disappearance of Howard. On rising the morning after his parting with him to return to his chamber, Duncan went to his room for the purpose of saying to his brother that he had resolved to pass the week which he had promised him to remain, at Norfolk, where he should escape the unpleasant necessity of meeting with Isabel, whom he felt no wish to see again, now that he had made up his mind to resign her to his brother. He knocked twice at the door, and receiving no reply, he opened it and entered. To his surprise the bed had not been slept in; the pillow was unpressed! Wondering what could have kept his brother up, he hurried down to the drawing-room, expecting to find him sleeping upon a sofa. But in this expectation he was deceived. Breakfast was, at this moment, announced to him by a servant. `John, is my brother in the breakfast room?' `No, massa Duncan,' answered the African. `Have you seen him this morning?' `I hab'nt seen mass' Howard since I saw him come 'ome wid you, mass' Duncan, lass night.' `It is very strange,' said Duncan in an under tone, as he followed the slave to the breakfast room. Here were seated his father and mother. Colonel Dudley was a fine looking military man, with his hair powdered, his bosom ruffled, and wearing buff breeches with silver buckles in his shoes. He was about sixty-five years of age, but being well preserved, looked not more than fifty. His air was dignified and somewhat austere, but his manners were those of a finished gentleman of the `old school.' His lady was tall and graceful, and at the age of fifty-five retained the graces of more youthful charms. Her smile was remarkably sweet, and her manner affable, gentle, and full of dignity. She smiled on her son as he entered. He respectfully kissed her cheek, and then bade his father good morning, which the Colonel acknowledged by a gracious paternal nod. `Where is Howard?' asked his mother, seeing him come in alone, for generally both brothers rose about the same time and walked together before breakfast. `I have not seen him, dear mother. He has evidently not slept in his bed.' `He probably remained at Judge Sumpter's,' she said, as if not surprised. `No. He came home with me, and we bade each other good night at the hall stairs.' `Had he any business that could have called him to town so late that he should have gone out again?' asked the Colonel, interested in the inquiry. `Not that I know of, sir.' `Has he had any quarrel with any one of late?' `No, sir, not to my knowledge,' answered Duncan with a sudden suspicion. `Yet he may have had. But then he would have made me his confidant.' `God in mercy forbid he should have gone abroad to fight a duel,' cried his mother with intense solicitude. `I can ascertain, sir, at once,' said Duncan, hastily quitting the room. In a moment afterwards he returned and said: `He has not taken his pistols nor his sword with him.' `Then he has rode to town,' answered the Colonel. `John,' said Duncan to the slave, `go and see if master Howard's horse is in the stable.' In a few minutes the negro returned with the information that he was, and that no horse had been taken from the stalls. Duncan and his parents looked at each other a moment and then sat down to breakfast. `He will turn up by and by,' said the Colonel. `It was not right for him to go off for a night without giving us notice. After breakfast, you had best ride over to Judge Sumpter's, Duncan, and see if he is not there. Perhaps he went back,' added the Colonel, smiling archly as he broke an egg into his glass, `after he had left you at home, to take a moonlight walk with Miss Isabel! You know there is a tender attachment in that quarter.' Duncan felt his temples burn, and was conscious that his mother's eye detected his confusion. He made no reply, for he was too well convinced of the truth of his father's words. Mrs. Dudley, after letting her gaze rest for full a moment on her son's countenance, which told her of a fact she had not before suspected, let drop her eyes and said: `Perhaps Howard has had a restless night, from some cause, and not being able to sleep, went abroad very early.' `I think this is the most probable construction we can put upon his absence,' said the Colonel. `So we will not let it trouble us any longer.' Duncan also thought so, and he well knew what was the cause which had driven sleep from his brother's eyes, were his mother's suggestion true. He felt that Howard had indeed a deeper feeling in the matter they had been the night before conversing upon, than he chose to betray before him. `Yes, he said to himself, `my generous brother is struggling between love and fraternal affection. His love for me will conquer too, to his own and her misery, unless I myself fly. I will see Howard, and depart, and remain at Norfolk the week I have promised to delay. But where shall I discover him?' He thought, in his heart, that he had only to ride over to Judge Sumpter's to solve this query. But there he had not the courage to go. He had solemnly renounced Isabel to his brother, and he wished to see no more the treasure that was no longer to be his. `Duncan, I feel anxious about Howard,' said his mother, coming to him as he paced the hall an hour after breakfast, waiting his brother's return. `I fear some accident may have happened to him. He may have fallen from the cliff, or been gored by a stag, or shot himself accidentally with his gun. I wish you would go forth and seek him; and perhaps you will find him with Isabel Sumpter.' The blood flew like lightning to his temples at the mention of this name, and again the observing mother had her growing suspicions confirmed. `He did not take any of his guns. They are all here. He may have gone to Judge Sumpter's. I will walk in that direction. I will take Scot with me,' he said, glancing towards one of the servants, who, while he was at home, acted as his body servant. `Follow me, Scott.' `Yes, massa.' `Don't drive Belt back; let her come also,' he said, as the slave would have prevented Howard's greyhound from following. `It is so strange, too,' said Mrs. Dudley, `for Howard to be out without Belt. Well, I hope we shall soon hear from him. It is now nearly eleven o'clock. Hasten, Duacan, for I am full of fears!' `If he is not at Judge Sumpter's, let me at once know, Duncan, said Col. Dudley, with animation, `and I will have a general search for him. Ascertain if he has been seen on either of the high roads.' `I will, sir,' answered Duncan, who had now began to feel equally anxious at the absence of Howard. It was very plain to all that he had not gone away to remain, for he had taken nothing, not an article of clothing with him; not even his watch, which was lying on his table, run down. Duncan, followed by Belt and the negro, walked rapidly along the winding gravelled walk that bordered the lawn and hedge, until it entered the belt of woodland which extended along the ridge back of the cliff. The forest opened a hundred yards before the path reached the cliff, leaving a clear space in front, along which the way led, with a broad view of the Bay. On reaching this open elevated space, Duncan was surprised to see the fleet, which had lain at anchor in the Roads the day before, all under weigh and stretching sea-ward in a long line, the frigate leading. They were already far to leeward of him, and the leading frigate was nearly hull down on the horizon. It was an imposing and beautiful spectacle, and with an exclamation of surprise and delight he stopped to gaze upon it. This was the first intimation he had had of the sailing of the fleet; as he was not up when the signal gun was fired; and the woodlands covering the ridge had prevented a view of the Roadstead from the house. While he was looking at the sight, and letting a suspicion slowly steal into his mind that Howard's disappearance had something to do with the sailing of the fleet, he was made conscious that he was not alone, by a voice addressed to him. `A fine show, Dudley! You should have been here to have seen them get under weigh! They've got a fair wind, and by sundown will be ten leagues out to sea!' Duncan had already recoguized the voice to be that of Hamilton Woodhall; a young man for whom he had no very great liking; knowing him to be a person of dissolute morals, and altogether destitute of character, though belonging to a highly aristocratic family. He therefore dryly replied, without turning his head, `Yes, sir.' Woodhall bit his lip and muttered, `haughty!' But he was not one readily abashed or put down. He thought, in the vanity of his heart, that Duncan's dislike to him originated in a feeling of rivalry, of which Miss Sumpter was the object He again spoke. `Miss Sumpter should be here to see this magnificent spectacle! She has a fine taste, and is a devilish fine girl!' Duncan turned round and fixed upon the speaker his full dark eye, and for quite a minute removed not his stern, withering glance from his face. His lips parted to say something, but he was silent, and contented himself with turning away with a contemptuous curl of his lip. It seemed desecration to him for such a man to utter Miss Sumpter's name, and in such a flippant, impertinent way. `Humph! You don't seem to be in the best of humors this morning, my lord Dudley,' said Woodhall, in ironical allusion to Duncan's known relation to a noble English family. `You are impertinent, sir,' said Duncan, with a flashing eye. `I was merely jesting,' said the young man, stepping back a pace for better security; for he felt he could not safely discharge the little spite of his heart upon him. `Then jest with thy fellows,' answered Duncan. `Where is Howard? I can get along with him! We are friends!' `My brother Howard hath both chavity and patience, and may endure thee. Hast thou seen him this morning?' asked Duncan, eagerly. `No. But I was going to tell him I had a pair of pup stag-hounde to sell, and that he shall have them at a fair price.' `My brother is not at home,' answered Duncan, `nor has he been this morning. I am now seeking him. He is probably at Judge Sumpter's.' `No. I came past there! I asked the servants if he was there, and they said no; for I thought he might be there, and save me a walk. You know he is in love with Miss Isabel, and she with him,' he added in a significant tone, and watching with secret delight the effect of his words. `This is nothing to thee, sir; and the less Miss Sumpter is alluded to, the better and safer it will be for thee,' said Duncan, menaceingly. `I take no threats from any man,' responded Woodhall, doggedly. `If you like blows better they shall be at your service on your next offence,' answered Duncan, fixing upon him his eyes so sternly that those of the young man fell; and walking slowly away he muttered, `You shall one day repent this insult! I will move all hell, Duncan Dudley, but I will bring down your proud neck!' Duncan smiled scornfully, and continued on his way along the cliff, insensibly taking the path leading to Judge Sumpter's. The sight of the house before him only brought him to a consciousness of the direction he was taking. `Why should I go thither?' he said, `Hamilton Woodhull says he has not been there. Scott!' `Massa,' answered the negro coming up from behind, and taking off his hat. `Go forward and see if Master Howard has been to the Judge's this morning. Be sure that you ascertain certainly. `Yes, Massa,' answered the negro putting on his hat and starting forward. `Scott.' `Massa.' answered the black, taking off his hat again and making a bob bow. `You need not say I am here. Go and return to me directly.' During his absence Duncan, with Belt lying on the grass watching him, paced to and fro in the path near the seat where he had met Howard and Isabel on his return home. He recalled this scene with pleasure and pain. The return of his servant interrupted his reveries. `Well, Scott!' `De Judge say how he hab seen notin' ob Mass Howard dis day.' `And'—Duncan hesitated a moment and then continued, `Miss Isabel, Did you sce her?' `Yes, I did, Massa Duncan.' `Well what did she say?' asked Duncan impatiently. `She was little sick, lying on um sofy in de parlor. And when I axes for Mass Howard and tells the Judge as how he was loss since last night, she scream and run to me and axes me twelve an' a hundred question `bout him? But Mass Judge quiet her, and tell me to go back, and when I find Mass Howard to let him know. Dem's what Miss Isabel say, Mass' Duncan.' `It is plain her life is wrapped up in his; and that she can never be mine,' he said bitterly. `But what can have become of my brother? I begin to fear the worst. Strange suspicions agitate my mind, which will not be driven out! If he comes not and we hear not from him to-day I shall be confirmed in them! But I cannot harbor them now. I will hasten home and learn if intelligence has not, by this time, been received from him! If not, then shall I fear, what I begin to suspect, that my brother has sacrificed himself by sudden flight or—no—he cannot have taken his life! I will think no more of it!' On reaching home, he found that Howard had not arrived and that nothing had been heard from him to account for his absence. His information that he had not been to Judge Sumpter's increased the solicitude of his parents; and after advising a few moments with Duncan, Colonel Dudley ordered the alarm bell of the estate to be rung. When all the negroes were assembled to the number of three hundred he selected fifty of the most intelligent and despatched them in every direction through the forest and along the sea-shore in search of him, with instructions to leave no crevice or nook unsearched. But night approached and no discovery had yet been made of anything which could afford a clue to his disappearance. The alarm of Colonel Dudley and his lady had extended itself to Judge Sumpter and other neighbors, who were assisting in the endeavor to ascertain the fate of Howard; the generally prevailing suspicion now being that he had been murdered or fallen into the sea. Isabel was only prevented by coercion from going forth to prosecute the search; and she remamed at home, walking the hall, in a state bordering upon frenzy; questioning every returning servant with an energy as if her life hung on his reply. Duncan was scarcely less calm; for he dearly loved Howard, and he believed that for his sake he had thus disappeared. The woodlands, the more distant forests of the domain, the bay shore for a league, had been traversed without any vestiges of him The sun was just setting when the several parties accidentally met at Judge Sumpter's, and reported to Colonel Dudley who, with Duncan was there, their total want of success. It was about a quarter of an hour before this time that a young man, rather shabbily dressed in faded fashionable attire, and with a face bloated by dissipation, who had been engaged very officiously in the search for Howard, only for the gratification, it would seem, of returning every half hour to Judge Sumpter's to tell Isabel he was not yet found; and to have her thank him warmly, and bid him again go upon the search with the others. This was Hamilton Woodhall. He was now traversing the beach on his way to make his usual report for the sake of speaking to Isabel, when a while object at a distance on a rocky ledge attracted his eyes. He hastened towards the spot, and as he approached he discovered it was a gull, which some one had shot, and which had fallen there. He was about to return when his eye fell on another object beyond the gull, which caused him to go on and examine it. As he approached he saw that it was a pile of garments and a hat. He flew forward and reached the spot where they were, hid by the spur of the ledge from view of any one on the beach. To his surprise he saw that they were the coat, vest, hat and boots of Howard Dudley. He stood for a moment gazing at them with astonishment. `Here is a mystery!' said he. `Here are his clothes, where can he be? But I will examine in the pockets.' In the vest he found a folded note. On it was some writing with a pencil. They were addressed to Duncan Woodhall was not scrupulous and read as follows: `Dear Brother: I have seen enough of your feelings and deep emotion at the discovery of Isabel's passion for me, to know how much your happiness depends on regaining her entire affection. It is true I love her. But what is my love compared with yours for her. She was first yours and she shall still be yours.— I have, therefore, determined to remove what I sincerely believe to be the only obstacle to the re-union of your hearts—myself! To night I go without leave-taking. Her I could not bear to part from; you would not let me go! I did intend at first to depart unknown to all and let it be supposed I was dead—had accidentally fallen from the cliff and drowned. But I could not bear to grieve you with this idea. I therefore leave this note, which I have written rudely to-night on the rocks here, to tell you that I intend to swim to the fleet, and commit my destiny for the future to it in its active service in foreign war. Make no efforts to regain me, if the fleet should not sail before you get this. But I wish that Isabel should believe me dead! It is only with this belief that her heart will return to you. Therefore let her know nothing of my fate. Let it remain in mystery. She may grieve, but time will heal her sorrow. I shall bury mine in action. This secresy on your part, dear Duncan, will only render the sacrifice I am making of any avail. Believing I live, she will still, I fear, withhold her heart; and I wish her to give it to you freely and entirely. Do you not owe to me, the sacred compliance with this, my last request? Now God bless you both, and make you both happy, is the prayer of your affectionate brother, Howard. P. S. After I hear of your marriage, I may return! Till then you will not hear from me. Hamilton Woodhall read this note to its close, and then stood thoughtfully gazing upon it for some minutes immoveable. At length the thoughts it gave birth to in his depraved mind, found utterance. `This little paper now unravels the whole of the mystery,' he said in a tone of intense satisfaction. Howard has got aboard the squadron, and is now ten leagues a-sea!' (But at the moment he was speaking, Howard was within half a mile of him, just prepairing to launch his plank for the brig, which Woodhall plainly saw not two miles from him, but which did not attract his attention, so wholly absorbed was he with his discovery.) `Well, he is a fool and that is my opinion! Here he has given up Miss Sumpter whom he loved, and who loved him in return, to that haughty brother of his, Duncan, because he happens to be also in love with her. And that Miss Isabel may have nothing to tempt her, he swims a mile or two to get on board of a ship and get out of her way, leaving Duncan a clear coast. This is d—n handsome to say the best of it, but it is what I call being a confounded fool. But that's his look out. He's gone, and his absence is all in my favor as well as Duncan's, who shall not have the whole field to himself, if I can help it!' Here he stopped and seemed to be impressed with some sudden idea, which from his manner, must have promised to himself the most important results. All at once his gray eyes flushed, while his eyebrows lowered darkly over them like an assassin's. He compressed his thin lips with vindictive resolution, while his hands were nervously clutched together. `I have it! I have it!' he muttered through his shut teeth, looking stealthily around him, as if he feared the winds and the waves should catch his words, and bear them to human ears. It shall be done! Then without a rival, Isabel Sumpter is mine! Ha, ha! Proud Duncan Dudley! I have you in my power!' And he laughed inwardly with malicious joy. `Now for the first step!' In furtherance of his dark purpose, whatever it was, which he had resolved to achieve for the ruin of his enemy and rival, he took up Howard's coal, and after rending the sleeve and collar, he rubbed it forcible along the rocks. He tore the rest in a similar manner and bruised and battered the hat. He then put stones in the boots and dropped them in the water saying: `These I will sink! They might weaken the evidence instead of increasing it! Now for the gull which Providence seems to have sent here expressly in my behalf.' He then went for the gull, and opening its breast with a knife, sprinkled the blood over the vest and coat and hat, the latter saturating so that the lining on the inside was crimson. Having done this he buried the bird in a crevice of the ledge, and covered it from sight by throwing stones upon it. `Now,' he said with fiendish exultation, after carefully washing the blood from his fingers, `now have I done it in so effectual a manner, that I feel as if I had really murdered Howard myself! If he gets through this clear, then it will be because he gets the devil to help him!' With these words Hamilton Woodhall gathered up with a stick the hat coat and vest, and took his way along the rocks to the beach, and thence up the pathway along the cliff leading to the mansion of Judge Sumpter. It was just sun down when he arrived at the house, in front of which was Colonel Dudley and lady, surrounded by their-friends, just getting into their carriage to return with heavy hearts to their home. `Dere come Mass' Woodhall, Massa Colonel,' said the coachman. `He runnin' and hab someting!' Colonel Dudley drew back the foot which he had placed on the step of the carriage, and looked in the direction his servant pointed, towards which all eyes were now turned Woodhall was not a little gratified to find himself the object of general attention, and full of the importance of his discovery he advanced towards them, endeavoring to conceal his malicious pleasure at the effect he was about to produce under a look of deep sorrow and sympathy. `What have you found?' asked Duncan with quickness, making a step towards him!' `What you same folks would like should have remained unfound,' rejoined Woodhall, with a significant glance, which Duncan did not understand, but which, nevertheless, made him feel unpleasantly. `And what is it?' questioned Judge Sumpter, impatiently. `Do you know whether that is Howard's cast or not?' asked Woodhall, holding up the bloody and torn garment before Colonel Dudley. `I should not know my own in such a condition,' he answered with a pale countenance, and catching at the carriage door for support. `Is that his vest?' asked Woodhall coolly, displaying the vest stained with blood. `It is, it is!' shrieked Mrs. Dudley, and Isabel at the same moment! `My son is dead! Howard is murdered!' `Here is his hat which I also found!' he said. Duncan snatched the ensanguined hat from him, and glancing inside, dropped it from his hands, and pressing his forehead groaned, fell his whole length upon the ground, insensible to the shrick of Isabel and of his mother which pierced the air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. The investigation—Hamilton Woodhall's narrative—The astonishment of Duncan—His resentment—The examination by Judge Sumpter—Woodhall relates his visit to Judge Sumpter's —His entrance—He overhears Duncan and Isabel—The effect of his statement—Duncan is suspected—His arrest— Isabel believes him guilty The manner and situation in which Hamilton Woodhall had found the bloody hat and vestments, were briefly detailed by him to Colonel Dudley, Judge Sumpter, and other gentlemen who were present; and the conviction was, that he had been murdered. `There can be no doubt of it, gentlemen,' said Woodhall, in wardly rejoiced at the success of his fiendish deception; `see the back of this coat! It has plainly been dragged over the ground, and when Howard was in it! The buttons are scratched as if with gravel! And the hat has mud upon it!' `It is very clear,' said Judge Sumpter, with deep commisseration in his tones and looks, as he glanced at Colonel Dudley, who stood gazing upon the vestiges of his son with stupefied amazement. `It is very clear that my young friend Howard, has been vilely murdered. `Murdered! my brother murdered!' murmured Duncan, who had been partially restored, and now started from the arms of his-friends who were supporting him. `There can be no doubt of it, my son,' said his father! `he has been decoyed from the house, and brutally murdered upon the beach! These bloody clothes bear stronger testimony to the deed than human language!' And the old gentleman brushed the tears from his eyes, and tried to address a word of consolation to Mrs. Dudley, who sat in the carriage overcome with the most violent grief. Duncan glanced at the garment of his brother as they lay upon the ground, and with a groan of horror turned away and wept like a child. `Have you any suspicion, sir, who could have been the perpetrator of the deed?' inquired Judge Sumpter of Hamilton Woodhall. `Do you know if he has recently had a quarrel with any person?' `No, Judge, I do not,' answered the young man hesitating, and then glancing at Duncan slightly but significantly. `Did you search for the body?' `No, sir! As soon as I found these, I hastened to let you know!' `Search must be at once made for the body. Besides we would like to see the spot where the clothes were found! Would you not Colonel?' A general assent being given, the whole party proceeded to the beach, and were guided to the spot on the ledge by Woodhall, who explained to them the situation of things as he pretended to have found them, as clearly to establish their convictions that he had first been murdered and then dragged violently over the rocks. Search was made for the body until too dark to discover any object, and they prepared to return and defer further search until morning. `His body was probably thrown into the sea at ebb tide, in which case it would have been carried down the bay, said Woodhall; and I don't think any body 'll be likely to see it again. Or perhaps they carried it out in a boat and sunk it with rocks.' This opinion was plausible and was received by them all. And they returned slowly to the house of Judge Sumpter, under the melancholy conviction that by foul hands, the noble and generous Howard hed been made way with. `Now to discover the murderer,' said Judge Sumpter, after they had entered his drawing-room. `This I fear will be difficult,' said Colonel Dudley, pacing the floor between indignation and grief, while Duncan stood by a window, his fraternal bosom torn with a thousand conflicting emotions at the extraordinary event. The idea that Howard might have made way with himself once entered his mind, but was rejected with horror, while a moment's reflection showed him that it must have been by violence at other men's hands. He was bewildered with doubt and grief; while his heart bled for Isa bel, whose sobs he could hear from her apartment, mingled with the weeping of his mother. He was startled by Hamilton Woodhall's reply to the remarks of Judge Sumpter: `Not so difficult neither, Judge, as people would imagine,' was his reply in a tone and look of mystery. `Why have you suspicions of any one, sir?' quickly demanded the Judge, while the eyes of Duncan, and of all others in the apartment were turned upon him. `Why not exantly, Judge. But —' `Well, sir; for God's sake speak out!' cried Colone! Dudley, stopping in his walk across the apartment, and fixing his eyes earnestly upon his face. `If you know any one likely to have committed this murder, for murder it plainly is—poor Howard! It is your duty to name him,' said the Judge with impressive authority. `You said that it would not be difficult to find out the perpetrator!' `And I repeat my words,' answered the young man doggedly, not pleased with the manner in which he was addressed. Proud and sentitive, and knowing he was not entitled to respect, he was ever irritated when he thought it was wanting towards him. `It is my opinion you will not have to go very far to find the murderer!' and his eyes again glanced towards Duncan with that covert, significant expression which he had before noticed so unplesantly. `Then you know the man?' said the judge with surprise. `I only have my suspicions,' answered Woodhall, cautiously. `It is your duty then, to make them known,' was the answer of Judge Sumpter and other gentlemen present. `I only suspect from what I have overheard between him and another person!' `Between who and another person? You are very mysterious in your language.' `Unless I can receive the courtesy due to a gentleman, Judge Sumpter, I shall decline any further conversation on the subject,' he answered moodily. The Judge was about to reply warmly by reminding him that it was in his power to arrest him and detain him to answer; but having some knowledge of the disposition of Woodhall he merely remarked mildly, `It is is not my intention to treat you with any disrespect, Mr. Woodhall. You know we are all deeply interested in this painful affair.' `It makes my heart bleed to think of it,' answered Woodhall, willing to be conciliated. `Poor Howard! I knew him well!— We were great friends. It was a vile murder!' `On whom do your suspicions rest?' `Perhaps it might not be exactly safe to mention names,' he answered, again fixing his eyes with more marked significance upon the face of Duncan, who was standing near, waiting the issue with impatient anxiety. The direction of his eye was noticed by all, but gave rise to no suspicion. Duncan felt the glance, and was trying to understand its meaning, when Judge Sumpter continued, `We are all friends here, Mr. Woodhall. You can speak with perfect security. While you are delaying here the assassin may effect his escape.' `He has'nt escaped yet, nor will he, I think. He believes no one can suspect him, and feels secure as you or I. But there's more known than he thinks for,' and again Hamilton Woodhall's glance rested full upon the face of Duncan, and he smiled significantly. `What do you mean, sirrah,' demanded Duncan angrily, `thus glancing repeatedly at me with eyes full of secret malice?' `I did not look at you! It must have been your own conscience,' he answered with provoking coolness. Duncan was about to strike him in his impatience, when Judge Sampter restrained him. `Be temperate, my friend. He tries us all! If he answer not soon. I will have him arrested, and put him under oath.' `If you arrest any body, Judge, it will not be me. The man who murdered Howard Dudley stands there!' He pointed with an emphatic gesture, as he spoke, full at Duncan! There was a general exclamation of indignant surprise at this bold charge, and for a moment all were thunder-struck at its audacity. Duncan started, as well he might, and after surveying his accuser a moment with indignant contempt, he relaxed the hand which he had clenched to fell him to the earth, and smiling scornfully, he turned away. After a few moments silence, during which the eyes of all had been moving alternately from one to the other, Judge Sumpter, in a voice of stern displeasure addressed Woodhall, who stood calm and unmoved, and in a confident attitude, as if he was ready to maintain his words. `Young man, this is trifling! Some private malice hath led thee to this! We are not to be deceived by such groundless accusations!' `I am ready to re-assert and maintain it,' answered Woodhall firmly. `Duncan Dudley, who stands there, is the murderer of Howard Dudley!' His tone and manner seemed to carry conviction with them.— Every one fixed his eyes upon Duncan, who, after recovering from his susprise at this repetition of the charge, stood silently and proudly looking with wonder and astonishment at his accuser. `This is becoming serious,' said Judge Sumpter in a low voice to a gentleman near him. `It is indeed a grave charge, but it is groundless, I am convinced,' was the answer in the same tone. `So am I, answered the Judge. `Young man, you have made a weighty accusation against Mr. Dudley. You are aware of the difficulty in which you have involved yourself unless you are prepared to substantiate your charge. Something more than mere suspicion must be advanced to shield yourself from the consequences of criminal proceedings against you?' `I have not made my accusation idly, nor from any private pique,' answered Woodhall quietly. `What I have asserted I believe to be true, and when I have stated my reasons, I feel I shall be acquitted of any intention of wronging Mr. Dudley without cause, and prove to all present that in making the accusation I have, I have been influenced only by the motives which should govern the conduct of every good citizen. At this speech Duncan was filled with indignant astonishment, mingled, nevertheless, with not a little curiosity to know what he would bring against him to give the least color to such an extraordinary accusation. `It is false! He shall not speak! Duncan is innocent! The rascal should be driven hence by the dogs!' cried old Colonel Dudley with uncontrollable resentment. `It is necessary, Colonel,' said Judge Sumpter, `in justice to Duncan, that we should hear what he has to say, that suspicion may be wholly removed from your son's character.' `Well, well! Let him speak! And when he has done I will force the dog's words back again down his throat!' Woodhall smiled inwardly at the consciousness that he had the power of humbling the father and son, and said, in a calm voice: `I have publicly charged Duncan Dudley, who stands there, with being the murderer of his brother, Howard Dudley. I will now give my reasons for making this accusation. While Duncan Dudley was at home, during the college vacation, a year ago, he became deeply attached to Miss Sumpter, and betrothed himself to her. During his absence they corresponded as lovers do!—' `Impertinent slave!' cried Duncan, advancing towards him, as if he would have torn him in pieces. `Patience, Mr. Dudley! Let him go on!' said the Judge.— There is nothing told I know not already.' Duncan with difficulty suppressed his wrath, and Woodhall with a vindictive smile, went on. `A change at length came over the affections of Miss Sumpter. Howard had become her companion instead of Duncan, and insensibly he stole her affections from his brother. He did it ignorantly, not aware of his brother's regard for her, for I know, from my knowledge of his character, and of his love for his brother, he would never have been more than a brother to her. At length Duncan returned and discovered the true state of affairs. At first he was not angry with Howard or with her; but waited to assure himself of their sincere attachment. He was at length satisfied that their happiness was bound up in each other, and that to interrupt it would make them miserable!' `How knew you these were my thoughts sir?' demanded Duncan with a surprise that for the moment overcame his disgust for Woodhall. `By accidentally overhearing you talking aloud to yourself, as lover's sometimes do, in the forest path, one evening, as I was passing.' `Rather hideing to listen,' answered Duncan contemptuously. `But proceed with thy pleasant tale!' `You will find it less agreeable as I proceed,' answered Woodhall casting upon him a look of fiendish triumph. `This seemed to be his first feeling and it was honorable to him. I give him credit for it, as every gentleman would! But as day after day he saw Howard and Isabel—' `When you speak of that lady, you will call her Miss Sumpter,' said the irritated Duncan. `Your interruptions will not prevent me from telling all, Mr. Dudley,' answered Woodhall. `He became dissatisfied with his brother and envious of him; and having an interview with Miss Isabel (if that name will suit Mr. Dudley) he was convinced that if his brother was out of the way, he could win back her affections, without which it was very plain he could never be happy!' `You will keep your reflections to yourself!' cried Duncan chafing, and with difficulty restrained by his friends. `I cannot, gentleman, suffer this vile wretch to desecrate thus the most sacred feelings of my nature! Are you willing this should go on? Judge Sumpter can you suffer this fellow, to speak thus freely of your daughter?' `It is painful my young friend; but the charge against you is very serious, and it is proper that you and your friends should know all the grounds upon which it stands. You will oblige us by being brief, Mr. Woodhall! Come to the point!' `I will, sir! Last evening about this time, perhaps a little earlier, I called here to see Judge Sumpter about a pair of hound-pups I have. The hall door was open and I knocked but brought no one. I heard persons talking in the room, and supposed it was you sir,' he said looking at the Judge, and your daughter, `I walked into the hall and laid down my hat. I was then stepping towards the door which was open, when I heard Mr. Duncan Dudley's voice! There was no light in the room, nor in the hall. It was twilight. I had got to the door when I heard Mr. Dudley's voice, and not wishing to interrupt a tete-a-tete, I hesitated and was about to return, when I heard him say in a very impassioned tone: `You love me then, Isabel!' `Yes, Duncan, I love you as I ever did, and with the same degree of affection. I only love Howard more! I knew not all my heart's depths when I first gave it to you. What I gave you, you still have. What I have given to Howard you knew not of!' `What you gave me then,' he said to her, `was enough to make me happy then, it is enough to make me blessed now! I envy not Howard the deeper place he hath discovered in thy heart, so thou givest me the place that was mine.' `It is thine, as ever it has been, Duncan,' she said in a voice of deep emotion. `Then but for Howard,' he said with earnestness, may I hope you would still have been mine?' `Yes,' she answered faintly but firmly. There was a pause during which I was about to retire, for I had been an involuntary listener, when I heard him say, `I have one question to put to you, Isabel; answer it truly.' `I will,' she replied but her voice trembled. `Would you have been true to me if Howard had not sought her heart?' `Yes; next to him you are most dear to me!' she answered him. `Thanks, thanks!' he said warmly. `One more questions!' Here his voice fell but I distinctly heard him say: `If Howard were away—if he were dead, would you still love me and be mine?' Here there was a perceptable emotion and movement among all present; and all eyes were fixed earnestly on Duncan, who stood petrified with amazement. The interest was now painfully intense. Woodhall saw the full extent of the impression he had made and triumphed in his dark spirit. She replied with a perceptible shudder at the idea, in the affirmative. `Then Howard alone stands between me and your true and whole affection?' he said. `Yes, Duncan,' she answered him,' but why such dreadful questions;' `Only to relieve my self-love and pride; for I had suspected the cause might lay in some dislike to me!' `No, oh no!' was her earnest reply. `I trust then that circumstances will yet restore you to me,' he said to her in an impressive manner. Up to this sentence it will have been seen that the accuser kept tolerably well within the bounds of the truth; though leaving out much that would have redounded to the credit of Duncan's heart, and twisting other parts to suit his evil purpose. He said nothing of Duncan's intended departure, but as will be seen, gave an entirely different character to his closing interview with Isabel. He thus continued: `What do you mean?' she cried as if astonished at his words as I was myself. `Nothing,' he answered carelessly; `but Howard you know is adventurous, and some accident might bafall him, such as falling from a cliff or —' `Foul-mouthed fiend! I will pluck thy lying tongue from thy throat!' cried Duncan springing upon him. Two or three gentlemen drew him back, while he received so severe a reproof from Judge Sumpter that he felt the tide of prejudice was flowing strong against him. He folded his arms, and sternly and silently awaited the issue. `What strange words are these? exclaimed Miss Sumpter. `They have no meaning! he said with a laugh. `Say you will be mine Isabel—mine but for Howard!' `I have said it, Duncan, but—' `I could not hear the rest he said; but he made some inaudible reply which seemed to throw her into the greatest agitation. Suddenly he broke from her and rushed from the apartment through that window, when Miss Sumpter uttering a loud shriek fell lifeless upon the floor! I flew to her assistance, and had just raised her upon a sofa when you, sir,' looking impressively at Judge Sumpter, came in alarmed by your daughter's shriek!' `Is this last fact true, Judge Sumpter? asked Colonel Dudley, in a hoarse voice. `It is, sir! I was in my study and heard the shriek, and when I came in, I saw Mr. Woodhall bending over my daughter. `And you asked me the cause of it?' said Woodhall eagerly. `I did.' `And I said briefly that there had been some misunderstanding between her and Duncan Dudley.' `That was your answer,' said Judge Sumpter. There reigned for a few moments a dead silence throughout the large apartment. Eye met eye unconsciously, and all looked grave-Duncan Dudley stood like one entranced. He had been utterly confounded with surprise and astonishment, as Woodhall's testimony gradually unfolded itself! He saw at once his unpleasant position. He remembered his words to Isabel; but how had villany and conspiracy turned them against his own life! He felt that he could not deny having said them, and that the circumstances were strong against him. Yet his emotions were not those of fear and alarm! In the consciousness of his innocence, he believed that all others would regard Woodhall's words with the same sentiments of contempt he did himself. But when he looked round and met the various looks of surprise, suspicion, horror and grief fixed upon him, he was roused. `Can it be possible,' he said, looking round upon the ten or twelve gentlemen present, his eyes flashing, `that there is one individual here present, that can for a moment give harbour to the suspicion this vile fellow's words would seek to establish! He is only worthy of the contempt of every honorable mind. Yet I meet glances whose expression tells me I am really suspected of my brother's murder! Is it not quiet enough for me to know that he had been basely slain, that I must have my sorrow invaded by the suspicions of my friends?' `But, Mr. Dudley, the evidence is very strong,' said Judge Sumpter, mildly. `You doubtless are innocent of this crime! I believe you to be! We all believe you to be. But you must confess that circumstances are strong against you!' `I do,' answered Duncan more calmly. `It therefore is necessary, your own honor demands it, that this matter should be fully understood. Did you have a conversation with my child last evening, as has been stated? This is no tribunal! we are friends only solicitous for your honor!' `Did you make use of the words, that he has reported.' `Part of the conversation this honorable eaves-dropper has correctly stated. More he has garbled; more maliciously mis-stated, and much he has invented with no other motive, I now plainly discern than to injure me!' `One part of the conversation is only of importance. Did you say to my daughter `if Howard were dead would you still love me and be mine?' `I did,' answered Duncan calmly. Every person in the room gave a start, and his father groaned deeply. Hamilton Woodhall looked round with a triumph he could ill conceal. `This is unfortunate,' said Judge Sumpter, shaking his head and giving Duncan a commisserating look. `The question was asked in a morbid state of feeling, only to secure additional support to my pride and self-love, as he has had the grace to mention,' answered Duncan. `It is well known to all how fondly attached I was to my brother, and that my life at any time would have been sacrificed to save his.' `But love and rivalry make a great change in such feelings, even between brothers,' said Woodhall. `But I have not done, gentlemen! As soon as I could I followed him, thinking over what I had heard, and resolved to give Howard, for we were great friends, warning! So you see, gentlemen, I had even then my suspicions; but I must confess I was not prepared for quite so sudden a catastrophe as has taken place! Poor, Howard! Well, I followed him; but it was sometime before I found him, when I saw him and Howard standing together in the path on the cliff, talking. It might have been then about nine o'clock. I watched them, for I had my doubts and expected some mischief. At length they had high words.' `'Tis false!' cried Duncan, in a tone of thunder. `Our interview was full of kindness and brotherly love!' `Then you confess having been with your brother on the cliff after nine o'clock last night?' said Judge Sumpter, very gravely. `I do. After I left Miss Sumpter, having taken leave of her, with the intention of departing the country the next day, my brother overtook me, and generously offered to resign her. This I would not consent to; and told him of my intention. This was the subject of our conversation. We returned home together, and parted in the hall for the night, since then I have not seen my unfortunate brother.' `Now what further have you to say, Mr. Woodhall,' said the Judge, who by general consent had been suffered to pursue the inquiries. `They had high words, though I could not distinctly understand what was said, and then walked homeward together. I saw them till they entered the forest path by the cliff-head, and seeing they were quiet, walking along without speaking, I said to myself, `He will not do it to night, and to-morrow I will caution Howard! As it was late I then went to the Stag Inn, and lodged, instead of going home. Whether they went strait home or not is best known to Mr. Dudley.' Here the wily villain cast a significant look upon Duncan, and every eye followed the direction of his own. `This is an unpleasant business, Mr. Dudley,' said Judge Sumpter. `Gentleman, I am innocent! This is a conspiracy of fiendish malice and vindictive revenge against me, by this miscreant. I repeat to you, with a blush of shame, that your unworthy suspicions, should compel such an avowal from me, that I am innocent of this crime; if my brother be murdered!' `No man, Mr. Dudley, is above suspicion. The circumstances are very clear, and strengthened by your own confession of having proposed a benefit to yourself on the supposed condition of your brother's death. It is unfortunate, very. But I fear it will be my duty, holding as I do the commission of the Peace, to detain you on this charge. `Impossible,' exclaimed Duncan, with undisguised amazement, while grief and anger struggled in his expressive face. `It nevertheless is my duty.' `My father! do you regard me as guilty? Say you believe me innocent!' he cried, clasping his hands. `I do, my son! But suspicions are strong, and it is your duty to submit to arrest that you may be acquitted by the law of the land.' `I submit, sir,' answered Duncan, firmly; and folding his hands upon his heart, he quietly yielded himself a prisoner. `You must be detained as a witness, Mr. Woodhall,' said the Judge; `or give bonds for your appearance. The intelligence of his arrest was soon conveyed to his mother and Isabel by Judge Sumpter. His mother believed him innocent; but when he was told that Isabel uttered curses upon his head as Howard's murderer, his heart sunk within him, and with a desponding spirit he suffered himself in silence to be led away to a felon's cell.</field>

The trial of Duncan—The evidence of Woodhall—Isabel's condemning testimony—The defence of Duncan—He is found guilty—The effect upon Isabel—The sentence—Duncan in prison—Change in public opinion—Petition for his pardon —The pardon—The tragic fate of Woodhall—The departure of Duncan in search of Howard—The Tripolitan cavalry chief—The conclusion. There are some men who rise by the fall of others. Such a person was Hamilton Woodhall. The prominent position he had taken in the late events, made him for the time a conspicuous individual in the neighborhood. He was resolved, too, that it should not be his own fault if he sank again into his former insignificance. After the arrest of Duncan he made himself very busy deepening the prejudice against him. There was not an inn within ten miles where he had not held forth to gaping listeners, repeating with fresh embellishments, each time, the story of his discovery of the clothes; nor was there a private family in the county which he could have the least claim or color to call upon, into which he did not intrude himself to strengthen the impression against Duncan. His visits to Judge Sumpter's were frequent, but he had not yet had an opportunity of seeing Isabel, who had been confined to her chamber, extremely ill, after the excitement she had gone through. She passed her days in mourning the fate of Howard, whom in a sort of delirium she addressed as if present, in the most touching manner; and then suddenly changing her manner, she would break forth into the wildest invectives against Duncan as his murderer. `Yes, yes,' she would shriek at such times, `you did say those words, and you meditated his murder! But know, that you have my curse instead of my love!' Three months elapsed, during which period it was the firm conviction of all men that Duncan Dudley was the murderer of his brother. At length the day of his trial drew nigh. Isabel had been summoned as a witness. She had now so far recovered as to ride and walk out, leaning upon her father's arm. It was her firm conviction that Duncan was guilty. But her anger and horror had gradually softened down to pity and tender interest as she reflected that it was for her love he had imbrued his hands in blood. But she felt she could never forgive him; and when once he sent to her to request her to visit him in his cell, she firmly refused.— `Let him restore me Howard,' she said with tears. At length the morning of the trial came. The popular excitement was intense, and long before the hour of opening the court, thousands were gathered about the doors. They were at length thrown open and the multitude filled the house. The Judge took his seat upon the bench, and the prisoner was brought into court. His demeanor was calm and dignified. He had resigned himself to his fate. But conscious of innocence he was upborne by a strength from within that the guilty never know. His appearance prepossessed all in his favor. The case was now called, and the first witness was placed upon the stand. It was Hamilton Woodhall. His manner was jaunty and defying; and a sinister smile was visible on his lip. He looked round and assumed a bullying air to conceal his want of manly confidence. He looked the most like a criminal. He turned pale when the oath was administered, and meeting Duncan's clear eye fixed upon him, he looked down. His testimony varied considerably from what he had formerly given, for he now omitted his exaggerations and malicious inventions. He, however, struck to that part in relation to Duncan's words on the supposition of Howard's death. But on the whole, his testimony made under oath was so different from what it had been voluntarily at other times, that the circumstances in every candid mind were much weakened against Duncan's guilt. Isabel was then placed upon the witness stand, supported by her father, who was not the presiding Judge at the trial. She was calm and collected; but her extreme paleness showed that it was with the greatest effort she could command herself. Her testimony put the affair in its true light, and gave a true account of what transpired between her and Duncan, at their last interview. But it confirmed the testimony of Woodhall, in the question put to her by Duncan, involving a supposition of Howard's death. Once, during the delivery of her testimony her eyes met the tender, reproachful gaze of Duncan's, and such was the effect upon her that she would have fallen but for the support afforded her by her father's arm. The testimony for the prosecution having been gone through, Duncan rose to speak in his own defence. His address was manly, eloquent, and carried conviction of his innocence to every unprejudiced mind. He spoke affectingly of his love for his brother; and how for that brother's happiness, when he discovered his attachment for Miss Sumpter, he had so far from wishing his death, resolved the next day to take his departure from the country, that he might be no obstacle in the way of the youthful lovers. `I made this intention known to my brother, that night when we were conversing upon the cliff, and it was his warm and positive remonstrances against it, which the witness chose to represent as high words of quarrel between us. The absence of my brother is as great a mystery to me, gentlemen of the Jury, as it is to all of you. I do not believe that he has been murdered! I believe that he lives at this moment, though perhaps in a distant land. I know my brother's generous nature so well, that it is my firm conviction, that when he discovered my deep and prior attachment to Miss Sumpter, and my resolve to leave her that I might not interfere with his, that he anticipated my intention and secretly departed himself. It will be remembered that there was a fleet in the Roads which sailed the day he was missing, and he could easily have got on board of it undiscovered. It is my firm conviction that he did so. You would ask me to explain then the fact of his clothes having been found, torn and bloody upon the rocks. This may have been a ruse of my brother's to put an end to all hope in the mind of Miss Sumpter. If, as I believe, he swum out to some vessel, his hat, coat, vest and boots, would have been the garments he would necessarily leave behind him. You have here at the bar for inspection, only the three first named articles. But I have testimony to prove that his boots were found near the same spot; and the witness is now in court to produce them!' Here Duncan looked at Judge Sumpter, who on being sworn testified that he had found the boots with a rock in each at low tide, within a yard of the spot where the clothes were discovered. He then produced them to the inspection of the jury. `Now, gentlemen of the jury, if I had murdered my brother, I should have had no motive in pulling off his boots afterwards; neither his coat nor vest. If I had sunk the boots, why did I leave the clothes in open view upon a rock. It is plain that my brother disrobed himself and swam to some one of the fleet. I believe the boots were with the clothes and were sunk by the finder, because they would not assist his story. I repeat gentlemen, my firm conviction that my brother is not murdered. It is your duty to prove the fact of murder, before you can convict me of crime!' The address of Duncan had an extraordinary effect. The idea that he might not have been murdered, had not once entered the head of any man. Now that it had been suggested, it seemed plausible. No one could help contrasting Duncan's manly and open language, with the shuffling, shifting testimony of Woodhall; and popular feelings began to waver. The Judge now delivered his charge to the jury. It was doubtless meant to be impartial, but its bearing was rather against the probability of the prisoner's innocence. His honor had seen in the course of his judicial experience, too many bad cases seem good ones, by smooth and ingenious defences; and he was suspicious even where truth lay at the bottom. The more ingenious and plausible the defence, the more positive he was of the prisoner's guilt. `You must not give undue weight,' he said in conclusion, `to the fraternal attachment previously existing between them. Circumstances of a trivial nature, as all of you must have experienced, often interrupt this. And what cause so potent as that where the heart is interested and brother becomes a brother's rival! You have seen that the testimony of the first witness, in that most important part of it which relates to the language of the prisoner to Miss Sumpter, when he asked her `if she would be his in case his brother were dead,' is corroborated by the second witness in almost the precise words. This testimony is all important. You will not forget to connect with these words of the prisoner, his interview with his brother immediately afterwards, during which high word's were interchanged; and that this conversation is testified as having taken place near the spot where the bloody garments of the deceased were found by witness. And the fact that the prisoner was also the last person seen in the company of the deceased, is also strong circumstantial evidence in corroboration of his guilt.' The jury retired and after half an hour's absence, returned into court, and after resuming their seats in the midst of a profound silence, Duncan was commanded to rise and hear his sentence. `Gentlemen of the jury,' said the Judge in a tone of solemn emphasis; `do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?' Duncan looked the foreman full in the face as he answered, in a firm, unhesitating voice, `Guilty!' Duncan did not move his eyes from the face of the foreman for the space of full a minute, during which he regarded him with an expression of undisguised surprise. He had evidently not anticipated this. His emotion could not have been ascertained from his countenance, for it was as pale and moveless as marble. But the agitated heaving of his chest showed that he was moved greatly within, from the very foundations of his being. The full extent of her testimony had not forced itself upon Isabel's mind, until this terrible announcement fell upon her ear. She had only thought of Howard, of his dreadful end and her loss! She had not given a thought of the consequences that were suspended on the assumption that Duncan was the murderer. The gallows and a public execution had not entered her mind! Now all rushed upon her! And the impression, too, filled her mind, since Duncan's defence that Howard lived! She was overcome by the agony of the conflicting feelings that flowed in upon her, and shrieking aloud, `I too am become a murderer!' she fell senseless upon the floor. She was borne from the court nearly lifeless, followed by the pitying and loving eyes of Duncan, who but that he was a prisoner, would have obeyed the impulse of his soul, and flown to her. He did not know that she had expressed a wish before she was summoned, to bear testimony against him. But this knowledge could not have changed his affection; He knew that she believed him guilty; and sorrow, not anger, filled his bosom. `Prisoner, stand and receive your sentence,' said the Judge. Duncan rose and looked upon the Judge with a firm countenance, and with an air of impressive dignity. But it was plain that it cost him a strong struggle to seem thus calm. After briefly touching upon the chief points of the convicting testimony, and showing in strong colors the heinous character of the crime of which he had been convicted, the Judge thus concluded: `Therefore, in atonement to the laws of the land which you have openly violated by the commission of a great crime, and of which you have been this day convicted by a jury of your peers, you are condemned to incur its penalty; which is death! You will now be taken in custody of the sheriff to the prison whence you were brought, there to remain until Friday the seventh day of March ensuing, when you will be led forth to execution between the hours of ten and twelve in the morning, to be hung by the neck till you are dead, dead, dead! And may God have mercy on your soul!' This sentence was pronounced amid a most profound silence throughout the court, and was listened to by Duncan with calmness. The court then adjourned, and the prisoner was reconducted to his cell. Left alone, Duncan for a few moments remained wholly over come by his feelings. But strong in the power of his innocence, he shock off this weakness, and, walking to and fro in his cell, began calmly to survey the whole ground of past events, and the result was his firm conviction that Howard had voluntarily fled, and was then alive! This conviction strengthened itself in his mind the more he thought of it, and the reflection, notwithstanding the dark cloud that hung over his own head, was a source of joy to him. `If I die, Howard will hear of my sad fate, and his presence here will prove to the world my innocence and its own injustice. I shall not die leaving a felon's memory behind me! My innocence will be proclaimed as wide as my crime hath flown! If Howard return, and with Isabel be happy in their mutual love, then shall my death be welcome. She, at least, will weep over my grave, and my memory will be blessed.' It was night, three days after his trial. A carriage suddenly stopped in front of the prison. In a few minutes after the jailor ushered into the cell a veiled female. It was Miss Sumpter. `Duncan,' she said, as the door closed on them, `Duncan,' and she fell on her knees at his feet. Her sobs prevented her from articulating more. `Isabel, this is kind to visit me,' he said, tenderly! `Calm yourself!' And he raised her from the stone floor. `I will. I have come to ask you to forgive me!' `I have nothing to forgive, Isabel!' he replied, in a kind tone. `I am your murderer! I believed you guilty; and in a feeling of strange, wild vindictiveness, I cursed you, and desired to bear evidence against you! But I was mad! I had lost Howard, and I forgot all else in him! I knew not the consequence! I have suffered, oh, I have greatly suffered for it. Duncan, I cannot live unless you say you forgive me!' `You are not an offender, dear Isabel! I can easily understand your feelings. Circumstances, too, have been strong against me, in proof of which I am now under sentence of death. Do you believe me guilty?' `No—oh, no!' she said, carnestly. `Forgive me that I have done so! Oh, say I have your forgiveness!' `You have, dear Isabel!' `I am happy then! I know you do not despise me! I have wronged you from the first, noble Duncan! I ought to have been true to you in my affection! I ought to have crushed in the outset all wandering of the heart towards Howard! I was fascinated! I was weak! I was guilty! But I have your forgiveness!' she said, with such intense emotion that he trembled for her reason. `Yes, all and freely. Be calm, I entreat you, Isabel!' `Duncan,' she said, with startling energy, `I not only do not believe you guilty (God forgive me that I ever should have cherished the thought!) but I do not believe, oh joy! I do not believe that Howard is dead! I believe he lives, and that we shall yet see him again!' `This is my own firm conviction,' he said, with solemn earnestness. `I think he escaped to the fleet!' `And so do I and also my father, since your defence. He has already written to the Mediterranean, to the commander of the squadron, to ascertain if any intelligence of him can be elicited before the day of—' Here Miss Sumpter stopped, trembled, hid her face in her hands and groaned with anguish. `Let not this distress you! I fear not to die! But I trust my innocence may be established before it is quite too late!' `You shall not die! I will throw myself at the feet of the President! I will implore, I will entreat, I will obtain your pardon! You must not die!' `But death were preferable to life, with the stigma of crime upon my name! No, Isabel! Do nothing further than your father has done, and thank him from me for his kindness. My father and mother also believe me innocent, and are persuaded that Howard lives! This assurance, with the consciousness of my innocence, supports me in this hour of trial!' `Oh, that I should have increased the load of your sorrow!' `Think no more of it! The assurance of your sympathy—' `Call it not coldly thus, Duncan!' she said, reproachfully. `It is love! Your danger has told me how truly I love you! I now see that I have erred in turning from your noble affection to Howard's bewildering passion! Through all my delight in the idea of being loved by him, I know my heart was thine still! It is thine now! It shall be thine forever!' `But I am a felon condemned to die!' said Duncan, scarcely able to restrain his heart's deep joy at the return of his wanderer! `I care not for this,' so I can hear thee say that your heart will once more be opened to receive me!' `It will, it will, dear Isabel!' he said clasping her to his breast. `It has ever been open to thee, ever been true to thee! But, alas! if Howard lives and comes back, am I not robbing him in taking thee to my bosom!' `No, Duncan. If Howard lives, it is that he has voluntarily departed that he might return me to you! It will make his generous spirit happier to see me thus lying on your true and manly breast than to fold me his bride to his own heart! Henceforth if he be dead, his memory shall be to me as that of a brother; if he is living he should be to me as a brother dearly loved for his sake and thy own. Am I forgiven and accepted, dear Duncan? Is the heart that first throbbed for me beating as in former days, true and strong with love to me? for mine hath found its resting place.' Duncan replied only by folding her more closely to his doting heart. The day of execution approached, and as the time drew night, the opinion that Howard Dudley might still be alive, gained ground. It prevailed among all his friends and even the press advocated it. The result was that a petition was drawn up and signed by a large proportion of the citizens of the county praying for his pardon. It was successful, and the pardon arrived on the very morning of the execution, while his parents, Judge Sumpter, Isabel and other friends were present, either to take their last leave of him or conduct him away in triumph. On its being read, Isabel shrieked with joy and threw herself into his arms. Duncan received the announcement with that dignity and self-possession which had characterised his conduct throughout. He was at once escorted to the carriage of Judge Sumpter amid the cheers of a numerous multitude, who had not only imbibed a strong impression of his innocence, but had assumed at once with the fickleness of popular prejudices as the alternative the guilt of Hamilton Woodhall! This impression spread rapidly among the crowd assembled to the execution, and soon became general. This individual in achieving the condemnation of Duncan had effected a purpose that gave him no little satisfaction. He had avenged himself for the contempt with which Duncan had treated him, and he triumphed over his fall. But the conviction of Duncan was but a secondary object to one of primary importance. He had got him out of the way that he might safely address Miss Sumpter, whose fortune made her hand a desirable acquisition to a young man of his broken fortunes. He, therefore, waited only a day after Duncan's conviction, before he presented himself at the residence of Judge Sumpter. He was well received, for his conspicuous part in the late events had thrown him more familiarly into his society and that of other gentlemen. His efforts and artifices to obtain an interview with Isabel, safe in her father's presence, were all in vain. At length his visits became so frequent and his manner so pointed, that Miss Sumpter could not be blind to his object. She, therefore, studiously shunned him; for she never endured him, and the part he had taken in the condemnation of Duncan, so far from commending him as he hoped, to her good graces, only roused in her bosom emotions of disgust. The day before that set for the execution of his victim he called, and entered the drawing-room unannounced. He surprised her in tears! She would have fled but he detained her by calling her by name. `Sir!' answered Isabel proudly. `May I ask why you avoided me! I had hoped that I stood better in your opinion.' `Sir, I look upon you as little better than Mr. Dudley's murderer, if he dies,' she said almost fiercely. `Your testimony was a false representation of facts, and through all I have discovered a fiendish disposition on your part to destroy him.' `But I firmly believed that he murdered Howard!' `It is false! It is my belief, sir, that you stained with blood and bruised the clothes you found, to effect the end you have plainly sought to achieve—Mr. Dudley's ruin! It is like your nature, sir, to do it and I believe it! Else—' here she fixed upon him a look beneath which his own hardened glance fell, `you yourself are the murderer!' With these words Miss Sumpter left him standing alone and overpowered with surprise and conscious guilt. He remained a moment in the attitude in which she had left him, and terrible fears took possession of his bosom. `Can she have seen his note?' he muttered to himself. `It can't be, for I destroyed it soon afterwards! Yet how should the woman have guessed so near the truth! I see I have no chance here after all! She is proud as Lucifer! If this idea should get abroad I had best take myself off. The country will be too hot to hold me! Especially if they should get this pardon. I must be cautious, I see!' With these reflections he left the house and proceeded homeward, or rather towards the Stagg Inn, where he lodged. It was towards this Inn, on the night of the day the pardon was sent to Duncan, and while he was surrounded in his father's house by numerous congratulating friends, that a band of gentle looking young men might have been seen cautiously approaching. They surrounded the house, and three or four of them entering, they drew Hamilton Woodhall from a crevice in the garret whether he had flown for concealment, and dragged him forth into the road. It was in vain that he plead for mercy. They mounted him upon a horse and escorted him to the village, where a attribunal was erected beneath the very gallows on which Duncan was to have paid the forfeit of his life, for a crime of which he was innocent. Here before a judge chosen by the young men, and the populace, Hamilton Woodhall was arraigned to answer, as he was told, for the murder of Howard Dudley. In a trembling was he protested his innocence. The opinion had gone abroad that he had stained the clothes with blood; and he was now called upon to tell the truth. Here a rope was put about his neck, and he was adjured to make a clean breast, or suffer death upon the spot. The result was a full, but trembling confession of the whole truth, with the use made of the blood of the gull, and the motives which led him to seek the ruin of Duncan. Every word of the confession was extorted from him by piece-meal, with the rope straitened to his neck. `Now, gentleman, said a young man, who had been a chief examiner in this well-conducted court of justice, for justice was at least found here, `what should be the punishment for such flagitious villany? I had a knowledge of the true facts of the case, from an account given me from an old deaf negro-slave, who only yesterday heard of the conviction of Mr. Dudley, and learned the facts. He then came to my uncle and told me he had shot a gull, as it proved on the very day of Howard Dudley's disappearance, when he was out in his fishing boat, and saw its fall upon the ledge. That he continued fishing awhile and then paddled in shore to get it, his course leading him under the rocks, a part of the time out of sight of the spot where the bird lay. He had emerged near it when he saw a man whom he knew to be Hamilton Woodhall, with the gull in his hand. He stopped his boat and watched him from behind the rocks, when he saw him cut open the bird and sprinkle the blood on some clothes and a hat he had in his hand. He then saw him throw the bird into a crevice and hide it with stones. On hearing this, I went with the old man and found the bird where he said it had been hid. It was not decayed, and its breast had plainly been out open: Old Paul's testimony would not be received in a court of law, we all know; but we reçeive it here in our court of Justice. Acting on his testimony I suggested this arrest and examination. You perceive, gentleman, that it is corroberated by the confession of the culprit himself. Now, what sentence is commensurate with his crime? He has not murdered Howard Dudley, I am satisfied; for that gentleman has in all probability absented himself from the generous self-sacrificing motive, stated in his brother a defence. Now what is your decision, gentlemen of the jury, for I address the whole multitude. Is the prisoner guilty or not guilty?' `Guilty!' was the simultaneously reply from a thousand voices. `Mercy! mercy!' cried Woodhall in imploring accents of agony. `You showed no mercy! But for the Governor's clemency your victim would have been dead this day beneath this gallows. Ask no mercy here, catiff! What shall be his sentence?' demanded the young man again of the multitude. `Death! The Gallows!' swolled upon the air in one deep voice from the stern throng of men. `Mercy! mercy!' shricked Woodhall, endeavoring to loosen the noose that was drawn tightly around his neck by the hands of three men on the other side of the beam. `Say your prayers, you have but a minute longer to live,' said the young man determinedly. When the shadow of the moon touches that nail you swing!' The wretch glanced a moment at the moon in the skies, shrieked, clasped his hands, and began to supplicate for mercy of those around him in the most heart-rending accents of terror. `The minute 's out! Up with him!' cried the young man in a strong clear tone. `Hold!' cried a voice, clearer than his own, in the throng.— `Will you do murder, my friends! Make me a passage through!' The rumor of what was going on in the village had reached Col onel Dudley's and instantly Judge Sumpter ordered his carriage, saying it must be stopped. The other gentlemen mounted their horses, and Duncan with them; but his anxiety to prevent the fearful tragedy gave impetus to his course and he first reached the ground. The shricks of Woodhall pierced his ears before he came in sight of the gallows, where a glance showed him the crisis of things. At the sound of his voice, the men who were drawing upon the rope involuntarily suspended operations to learn what it meant. In the interval of delay he gained the foot of the gallows; and without more ado, throwing himself from his horse, he with a knife severed, the fatal rope. `What madness is this, my friends!' he said, looking around. `We were but administering justice to this scape-gallows, Duncan,' said the leader. `We have proved him a conspirator against your life.' `It would have grieved me much, if this thing had been done. I know he is a wretch and has been set on against my life by malice! But I for give him freely, and think you will all do so, for my sake! What he has suffered to-night will be a healthy lesson to him. Nothing more could have been gained by his death. Let him live; for life; with the scorn that will follow him, will be to him worse than death, So, my friends, if you wish to punish him, herein your end will be answered!' There was at first some murmuring and loud objections, but these subsided, and soon after he had ceased speaking, the air was rent with loud acclamutions, in which Duncan's name was repeated with every note of pupular applause. Three cheers were then given to him, and after thanking them in a neat speech he turned to Hamilton Woodhall who had stood, trembling but silent and self-condemned near, him. `Now, sir, mount my horse and ride for your life! Take this! and he forced a purse into his hand. The terrified man did not wait to be twice bidden, for notwithstanding the diversion Duncan had worked in his favor, the demonstrations of hostility among the surrounding crowd were too palpable and too alarming to be disregarded. `Mr. Dudlev, I owe you my life!' said Woodhall, as he was about to leap into the saddle, `It is my belief your brother lives! In his pocket I found a note which I afterwards destroyed. It was addressed to you, and stated that it was his intention to swim off to one of the vessels of war, and leave the country. I believe that he did so. I have confessed already to these demons here that I sprinkled the blood —' Here he could say no more! The groans and cries of the throng alarmed him for his safety, and leaping into the saddle he galloped away through the space Duncan had opened amid the crowd. There was seen the bright flash of one and then another pistol from the midst of the crowd, none knew whence. The horse suddenly reared into the air, a wild cry like a yell rung upon every ear, and Hamilton Woodhall was seen to reel and tumble dead from his horse! `He has it now,' said the young man, who had been so conspicuous as the leader of the lynching party. `It's a pity; but he has revealed to me an act of villany I did not suspect! He has his deserts. I knew not how dark a villain he was! But he had done me a service for which I can forgive him all the past. My brother lives! He told me Howard left a note in his vest for me, stating that he was about to swim to a vessel of war and leave the country. This note he said he destroyed. Oh, the artful fiend of private malice! But 'tis past. My brother lives!' `Here is your horse, Mr. Dudley, said a man leading his startled horse towards the spot where he stood. `And Woodhall!' `He was a dead man before he left the saddle, sir.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CONCLUSION. The intelligence that Duncan conveyed to his parents and Isabel that his brother lived filled them with deep joy. He now resolved to take measures at once to discover him. This his fraternal love would have led him to do; but it was necessary for his own honor. It is true he had been pardoned by the Executive; but pardon necessarily implies guilt; and in this respect his position was only on a level with any pardoned criminal who had been really guilty of a murder. It was true that his friends believed him innocent but there were many who also believed him to be guilty. It was therefore necessary, aside from all the inducements of affection, for him to produce his brother. For this purpose he proceeded to New York and took passage for the Mediteranean, with letters from the Secretary of the navy to Commodore Barron, of the squadron in those seas, recommending him to him, and desiring him to afford him every facility in the prosecution of his search. On reaching the Mediterranean, Duncan found the President's frigate was at Syracuse, where he joined her. Six months had now elapsed since the fleet had sailed from the Roads. Commodore Barron made every inquiry in his power; but it was some weeks before Duncan could gain intelligence from all the vessels of war, ss they were dispersed on different stations. From neither of the frigates could he hear of any one coming on board in the Roads. At length Commodore Barron received a letter from Lieutenant Sterret of the Enterprise, in reply to one he had written, in which he stated that such a person had come off to the brig in the Roads, and that he was four months ago taken prisoner in a brush on shore, with the crew of a Tripolitan polacca. It would take another volume to recount the various adventures through which Duncan passed in search of Howard, and the scenes through which the latter passed during his captivity. After four years' search Duncan discovered him the leader of party of Moorish cavalry, who came as an ally of General Eaton in his romantic attack upon Derne, which expedition Duncan had joined with the hope of entering Tripoli with it. The brothers met side by side in scaling the fortress of the town. Howard in his mustache and Moorish costume, was unrecognised by Duncan, whom he instantly recognised, and called him by name. Duncan suspended a blow in the air, he was about to deal upon the turban of a Tripolitan, gazed an instant into his brother's eyes, caught his smile, and with a glad cry cast himself into his arms. The two brothers returned to the United States together, but Howard was accompanied by his bride, a beautiful Greek girl, whom he had recaptured from a slave caravan, and whose bright eyes and thousand charms made him forget Isabel. The innocence of Duncan was now like the sunlight, and all men sought to atone for their suspicions by paying him marked public honors. His marriage with Isabel was celebrated with great magnificence, and during the evening Howard and his dark-eyed bride performed a graceful Greek dance. Thus happiness, peace and honor were once more restored to bosoms so lately darkened by grief and suspicions of guilt; and Duncan, from having known misfortune, had learned how to receive and enjoy the calm delights of prosperity. Let the reader, from the facts here recorded, long pause before he condemns another from the evidence of circumstances, however strong and convincing they may appear in his own eyes and those of the world.</field>
