      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. By the side of one of those romantic trout-streams that are embosomed in the glens of New-England, was to be seen, just before sunset of an afternoon in September, 1841, a group composed of three figures. The place in which they were was deeply secluded. Around them rose the huge columnar trunks of a forest which had been ancient when the first Pilgrim Father set his foot upon the western shores. Through the forest, which covered upland and intervale, flowed the dark wild waters of the brook, upon the banks of which they were assembled. The forest was solemn and grand, and its long vistas seemed like the huge gothic aisles of an old-world cathedral. The brook gambolled through this fine old wood in many a wanton circle, now sweeping swiftly around a smooth-faced rock, and now dividing to embrace huge oaks, whose heavy wide-spread branches dipped into the flood. In the darkest part of the wood it fell tumbling over ragged rocks in snow-white cataracts that glittered and flashed like silver contrasting the deep green and blackness of the shadows around. At the spot where the group was seen, it flowed still and deep, its waters being black and motionless as a pool, and reflecting in their mirror-like bosom every mammoth branch, limb, tendril and leaf that grew above it; also, a small strip of the pure bright blue sky that opened between the trees was seen far, far down in its depths. As the stream passed away on its course it went gurgling over a shallow bed and struggled amid a wilderness of confusedly heaped rocks, moss-grown and half clad in foliage, before it emptied into a broader and more quiet stream. At its junction the trees opened and permitted a sunny view of a distant meadow, with the spire of a village church beyond it, and upon the side of a hill were visible amid the grove in which it stood the chimnies and portico and imposing out-buildings of a gentleman's country-residence. Nearer the water, shaded by a noble elm of great antiquity, stood a very humble farm-house, over-run with wood-bine, and forming a picturesque object in the pleasant scene which the opening in the forest rendered visible. The group consisted, we have said, of three figures, not of three persons, for the third member of the group was a fine large brown dog, half Newfoundland, half mastiff. The two persons were young men, nearly about the same age, neither of them being above three and twenty; but here all resemblance terminated. One of them was a remarkably good-looking and well-dressed young gentleman, with that air and appearance, which at a glance showed that he belonged to what is termed `good society.' Though his attire was fashionable it was far from being buckish; but on the contrary in good taste, and worn with that easy, graceful negligence which distinguishes the truly bred young man from his imitators. In a word, Edward Austin would never have been mistaken for a journeyman tailor on a holiday. He was engaged in angling; and the better to enjoy his ease he was reclined at his length upon the thick, soft grass with his hand pillowed upon the moss-covered root of the vast oak which grew above him and cast its shade far over the water. His vest was open, his cravat loosely knotted in front, and instead of a broad-cloth dress-coat he was habited in a very becoming and well-cut blowse. By his side on the ground lay a huge brimmed straw hat, that looked as if it had seen service, and by it stood an ivory box with several compartments containing flies, hooks, sennet, cork, hair-line, and the other appurtenances of a practised amateur angler. On the other side stood a basket, from which, from time to time, a speckled trout would fling himself a foot or two into the air, revolve in a circling and graceful summerset, and then fall to lay quiet among his fellows. This basket was guarded by the two fore-paws of Bruce, the fine animal having placed them on each side of it as if to see that none of its restless tenants escaped. It was plain that he did not much like the frequent demonstrations towards freedom made by the trout in their saltations in the air, and his large hazel eye would expand and dilate as he gazed after some one of them ready to spring upon it if should not happen to descend to its place in the basket. His assiduous anxiety touching their security was betrayed in every lineament of his intelligent and dignified visage, and was the source of not a little amusement to the third figure of our group. This was a young man whose chief physical characteristic was fat. He was a juvenile Falstaff in shape and feature.— Though at least twenty three years of age, he had cheeks like a well-fed infant, fair and rosy. His face was the very picture of mirth and content.— His mouth wore a pleasant smile and his blue eyes sparkled with two merry stars in their centres that a tear never had dimmed. He had short curly hair, that made even his forehead look smiling and bright. He had a double chin and very fat hands, and his arms fitted his jacket sleeves, and his legs and trowsers like a tight glove well drawn on. He was not so tall as his companion by a head, for Edward Austin was nearly six feet in beight and finely proportioned. But Roundy Beebe made up in weight what he came short of in height, and compounded in flesh for want of length in bone. He was not lying on his back like Austin, but in a posture that suited his lazy habits better and at the same time insured his getting upon his feet again without assistance, viz: upon his belly. His face protruded over the water a little, and in his fat hand he held a fishing rod with a grass-hopper at the other end. He amused himself attentively in watching Bruce's anxiety whenever a trout would leap out of the basket, and in suspending the grass-hopper, which was alive, just so far above the water as to make it hop upon the surface. Edward Austin had, at the extremity of his delicate line a blue and scarlet fly, which he was skilfully playing in a black nook beneath a gnarled root, near that upon which he was reclining, and as he lay with his face a little turned to one side to overlook the spot, he was thus enabled to repose his person and pursue his pastime at the same time. Roundy's free and easy position was in humble imitation of his young master's more luxurious attitude. Thus they were grouped there, with the evening shadows darkening the old wood, the setting sun sending level arrows of golden light through the crevices in the glades on the western side, the dark water flowing by, the distant white cataract tumbling over and over itself in foam, and looking, through the dim trees and indistinct light like a huge white monster playing and curvetting, and madly roaring as if to break from some invisible bonds and dash through the echoing forest. `Well, Master Nedward!' ejaculated Roundy, after having succeeded in drowning his grass-hopper in vainly trying to make him skip over the surface. `Well, Roundy,' responded the young man in a familiar tone and with a pleasant half-smile; at the same time he threw his fly with a negligent air farther into the little pool in which he knew there was a fine trout lying covert. `I'se made up my mind!' `Well, let us hear what you've made of it!' `It's my pinion,, 'tant no use tryin to make hoppergrasses dance on the water if they an't got got no partners. They'll die dead and drown jist coss they feels so lonesome. You see how this one did I'm takin off my hook. Look at him! His legs is all skewered up under him, and his whiskers hangs down as meek and flimsy-flamsy as ever was!' `I didn't know before, Roundy, that grass-hoppers had whiskers!' observed Austin with a smile; he raised himself a little on his elbow as he spoke, and fixed his gaze with sudden earnestness upon his fly. As he did so a large trout whose shining sides and speckled back could be distinctly seen beneath the surface, darted for the bait, and in his eagerness sprung with it twice his length out of the water. `You're fixed now, Beersheba,' said Roundy, in a quiet tone of exultation as he eyed the captive in his struggles to escape. `If I had you there you might have some chance o' seeing your parents again, but when Master Nedward is t'other end o' the line then you may jest as well make your will and take it coolly!' The young gentleman `played' his fiery and rapidly darting prisoner with consummate skill and in a few moments drew him to the bank exhausted. `I told you so, my child,' said Roundy, as he raised himself from his belly to his knees, and began to disengage the trout from the hook; `I know'd you'd have to guv in and say die! Get out, Bruce! Your eyes sparkled as if you enjoyed the sport too! I wonder if Bruce couldn't angre, Master Ned, if so be as I could larn him to hold a rod slantendiklar. He's been a troutin' with us so much I'll bet a sojer agen an Injun chief he'd fish like a gentleman!' `You have my consent to teach him,' said Edward as he began to fold up and arrange his tackle; `but not to-night.' `He's knowing, brother Bruce is! but then I think sometimes he han't got common sense.' `Indeed?' `Darn me if I think there an't some humbug about him arter all, 'telligent as he'd make me b'lieve he was. Now did you see him watching them trout? Why he looked as tarnal skeered whenever one on 'em would jump as if 'twas a nest o' live hawks he was a guardin' and he expected they was a goin' to fly away. He'd watch 'em out o' his eyes when they'd hop a foot high jist as if he expected they was goin' right up through the trees into the sky and say `I'm off!' Now if he's a dog so sensible as he pretends he is, he'd know a fish couldn't fly, and that his watchin' that are basket was all glum jist like—jist like varnishin' sassengers. Now I dare say he thinks them fish has wings or legs, and if they git on the ground they'll streak it like a rabbit. Now for a dog what's reasonable and common-sense like on other things to be such a idiot about trout when he's been a fishin' as much as he has and knows their natur, dumsquizzles me.' `Dum what?' `Dumsquizzles me!' repeated Roundy with greater emphasis. `Yes I understand.' `To be sure you do. Dumsquizzles me it does, Master Ned?' `Don't believe thus of old Bruce, Roundy. He only amuses himself with a gambols of the fish. You mistook the expression of his eye.' `No I didn't. I can tell his feelins jist as well as I can yours, Master Nedward. His face is all over talk and readin' jist like a book. Why, I've laid on my belly on the grass, and Bruce layin' opposite me with his nose on his paws, and I've talked and gossipped with him by the hour, and I could understand him jist as if he had a spoke human words. There, he's listenin' and understands every thing I say jist as well as you do. Now that's what spifflicates me.' `Does what?' asked Austin, with a sly, mischievous smile; for he delighted to banter Roundy upon his peculiar and favorite modes of expression. `Spifflicate is a dictionary word, Master Ned,' answered the fat young man a little touched. `Is it? Oh, aye! `To be sure it is. I never uses a word I doesn't know what it means, Master Ned!' At this moment as Austin was about getting upon his feet to return homeward, they heard a rustling in the path behind them, and looking up beheld a young man approaching with a fowling piece in his hand, and a game bag and pouch slung beneath his arm. He had a handsome and prepossessing countenanee, but it bore the marks, not to be mistaken, of incipient dissipation. `Ah, Ned, my fine fellow, so you are just pulling up your traps and starting home!' he exclaimed in a lively tone. `What luck? Ah, I needn't ask. A basket full of fine fish! I think I shall have to turn trout-killer, for I can't find game. I have shot only two birds, one a plover and the other a meadow-lark. I saw a rabbit and two grey-squirrels, but I couldn't get a shot at them. I should like trouting but for the water. It don't agree with me standing over the water. It always gives me the ague.' `Perhaps, Master Ralph,' said Roundy with a sly twinkle in his blue eyes,' perhaps you'd like fishing in the Brandywine creek.' `Oh, you are there are you, you fat rogue!' exclaimed Ralph Waldron, lifting his gun in a playful manner, yet slightly coloring. `But that reminds me,' he said, taking a flask from his pocket. `I'm tired and knocked up browsing about all the afternoon, and now I've met you I mean to take a pull at my flask here, Austin. Come join me, and you, Roundy, shall have a mouthful though you don't deserve it, you are such a fat reprobate. Here Austin, here's a little silver cup I had made expressly to drink out of it. It holds just a wine-glass full. Come, `he added, filling the cup from his flask with pure brandy, `try a little. You have been fishing here I dare say this three hours, and it's dry work as gunning, if it is in the water.' And he presented the sparkling silver goblet to his friend. `Thank you, no!' quietly answered Austin, `I never drink.' `No, I know you don't, Ned,' replied Waldron with a smile of ready acknowledgment; `but then a little won't hurt you. I always take a thimblefull when I've been out exerting myself and I never feel fatigue. There is a sort of supernatural strength in a little brandy. Let me be ever so fagged out, two swallows makes me a man again! Come, Ned,' and the young man, whose strength lay in brandy, placed the cup upon the thumb and finger of his friend, as if he would press it insinuatingly within his grasp. `Excuse me, Ralph,' answered Austin firmly and looking a little annoyed, while a slight expression of mingled pity and contempt passed over his fine features, as he looked in the face of his friend and saw there the lines of intemperance faint, indeed, yet as decided and endurable as if cut in marble. The young gunner looked hurt, and slowly withdrawing his hand he fixed his eyes on Roundy, who was very busily occupied in winding up the last line. `Well, I won't force you, Austin. If you choose to refuse a friend you are at liberty to do so. But it's dull work drinking alone. A fellow looks foolish pouring a glass down his own throat, while others stand around lookin' on. Come, Roundy, you must drink with me. I dare say you never refused a good offer. I'll empty the cup and fill for you!' Thus speaking he placed the brilliantly colored `fire-blood' to his lips and was about to empty the cup when Roundy answered with a very serious air, copying in his reply the precise words of his master, `excuse me, Mister Ralph, I never drink!' `Why man your cheeks are as rosy as two goblets of port. You mean you never drink water!' And Waldron laughed, but in a way that showed he did not believe what he said. `No, Mister Ralph. I never drinked a bit o' liquor in my life, I nor Master Ned never did. When he takes to drinkin' then I will, not afore.— Drunk or sober I'm Master Nedward's shadow, and hope I al'ays shall be. But its drunk you never'll see this here shadow, I know that, Mister Ralph. So I'm werry especially 'bliged to you, and thanks you jist as much as tho' I was layin' down there in that bog puddle tipsy as a toper. When Master Ned crooks his elbow then I'll begin to shoot the stars with a tumbler turned bottom-up! Like master, like man!' `You talk, Roundy, as if there was great harm in taking a drop now and then. Now it does one good. It makes a tired man feel like a new man. Well, if I must drink alone I must. I'm not ashamed of it for I don't think there is the least harm in it! So Austin here's your health, and Roundy, my fatty, may your shadow never be less! `I don't mean it shall,' answered the young farmer very drily; for the position his master had taken he resolved to imitate to the utmost; he being in all things, as he truly termed himself, his master's shadow and admiring imitator. `If I looked at the stars often in the day time, Mister Ralph, I should no longer rejoice in fat and folly!' `Well, I will drink your healths and mine too, for I'm fairly used up. I've walked full three miles. In five minutes I shall feel as if I never knew fatigue. You don't know what you lose!' `Stay, Ralph,' said Austin, placing his hand upon his wrist as he was about to drink. `You say it gives you strength. Let us see if this is true. A year ago, before you had ever touched spirit, you and I leaped the stream just above there from rock to rock. We were both equal in strength and vigor and activity. `Come now,' added Edward, with a frank, kindly smile, taking his arm,' come, and before you drink that let us try and see if we can both leap it now. If drinking brandy has strengthened you, as you say, you ought to be able to out-do me now.' Waldron colored with sudden embarrassment, and then said in a hesitating manner, and with looks that were somewhat abashed, `I, I meant after I had taken a little! I will drink this, and in five minutes I will make the trial with you,' he answered confidently. `No. Try it now. If brandy has done you good you can now prove its benefits. By all odds, as I have drank none you ought to be my superior. Come Ralph, let us try!' `But I have walked so far.' `Three miles. I have walked no less than seven since dinner. I have been to the head of the stream and back.' `Yes, as I can bear witness to; for I sweat away at least five pounds of good meat on the way,' answered Roundy. `Now if you had taken a flask with you, Roundy, you would not have sweat so. But I must drink before I try.' `Then you acknowledge that you cannot leap so well now as a year ago. Your brandy has done you an injury, Ralph, by your own admission.' `Not a bit! I will try; but on condition that if I fail you will give me another trial after I nave taken a pull.' `Agreed!' cheerfully answered his friend. They approached the spot.— The space was fifteen feet wide. Austin took the leap boldly and cleared the stream with full two feet to spare beyond the verge. Ralph eyed the chasm and the swift water with a timid, doubtful aspect. He made three several demonstrations, and then turned away, saying with a look of mortification, `I don't feel quite well—head-ache. My sight swims a little. I give it up on this score, Austin. But let me try my brandy now, and I will prove to you the difference. I will show you that drinking does no harm, especially what little I take; for I never drink except I'm gunning.' `Which is every blessed day,' said Roundy in an under tone. He took off the brandy, and immediately half-filling the cup again with a quick furtive action, with his back half turned towards them, he drank this off also, looking like a man who had no confidence in his natural powers. `Now I am ready,' he said in a loud confident tone. `Come, my boy, let me have that little matter tried over again. I feel well. My head-ache has gone to the winds. Come, I'll show you, that though I felt a little bad just now, I am as good as I ever was.' This was spoken with that feeling of bravado which tries to outbrave shame. He stepped back, started, and run the three yards which was allowed to both, and then stopped short on the brink. `I don't feel the brandy working yet. I'll wait a minute or so, Ned!' he said with a laugh by which he would conceal his consciousness of physical inferiority; for he felt in his heart that brandy had been the foe to his strength and manhood. He paced the green a few times, and more than once involuntarily placed his eye upon the flask which lay with his gun and game bag upon the ground, with a longing desire to deepen his draughts; but a sense of shame or pride, whatever be the name of the sentiment, deterred him. After a few moments he again took his post, and with that bold and confident air which wine gives, he started for the leap. He threw all his strength and skill into the act, and his feet left the bank with a free spring. But the impetus was insufficient to carry him across, and coming short of the opposite bank he plunged into the deep and rapid flood. He would have been carried down but for the arm of Austin, who reaching out from the shore seized him and brought him to land. `Now, my friend,' said Edward kindly, `I trust you will confess the impotency of brandy to give a man strength. Believe me, it is his weakness! This I trust you are now convinced of, and will, like a man, dash the treacherous thing forever from your lips!' `It is because I was such a fool as to take too little,' answered Waldron doggedly. `If I had not cared for you and taken what I wanted too, I would have beaten you in the leap, instead of jumping into the stream as I have done. I owe it all to you.' `Why to me?' asked Austin with surprise. `Because you—you—that is, I hate to drink even as much as would fill a percussion-cap before such fellows as you, who look on as if it was damnation I was drinking. I don't like to drink before folks with such confounded ideas! There's no harm in it in the world. I never was drunk in my life, and never intend to be! No man despises a sot more heartily than I do. Never fear me, Austin. I shall drink a glass of wine or brandy when I want it, and I shall be never the worse for it! I must take something now or I shall catch my death of cold” Thus speaking he crossed the stream by a fallen tree a few yards above and hurrying, he applied his flask to his mouth with a gusto that caused his temperate friend to sigh heavily, and in imitation of which a grotesque groan came audibly from the chest of Roundy Beebe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. The two young men taking up their fishing and hunting instruments, and followed by Roundy Beebe, who in walking rolled like a man-o'war's-man from very obesity, walked on a little while in silence. The path led along the brook, and then leaving it crossed the larger stream beyond by a rustic bridge. At the other side of the bridge were two paths, one leading by the edge of the meadow round to the villages, the other crossing the intervale in the direction of the villa visible above the woodlands. `Here we separate, Ralph,' said Edward, `unless you will come home and take tea with me.' `Thank you, Austin. But I believe I'll go home. I leave for New York to-morrow afternoon you know, and I have got things to attend to. `Do you go so soon?' `Yes. I received a letter yesterday from my uncle, in which he said he would like to have me come to the city as soon as convenient, as he wished to leave as soon after I came as possible.' `You are going into partnership with him, Waldron?' `Yes. I was his clerk you know until I was twenty-one, when I came home to study law, for which I always had a fancy. But two years study has shown me that it is not so desirable a profession after all. So as my Uncle Ward wanted a partner, I wrote to him telling him I intended to relinquish the law and return to business, and proposed to go in with him.— The reply was he would like nobody better.' `This was certainly very creditable to you,' answered Austin. `Yes. Mr. Ward is a thorough merchant and a man of business. He was satisfied with me when I was with him. He could not help being so, for I devoted every hour and all my energies to his interests.' Austin was silent and thoughtful. At length he said sadly, `Your uncle, Mr. Ward has not seen you within a year or two has he?' Waldron glanced at his face with a quick eye of suspicion; for his conscience could not fail to help him in understanding the motive which led his friend to ask this question, and in a tone so sorrowful. He would have replied to him in a quick and angry manner; but he thought it best not to seem to have understood. `No. It is two years since I saw him,' he answered with an embarrassed air in spite of his forced indifference. `I trust you will find it pleasant in New York, and that your business connection with Mr. Ward will prove as agreeable as formerly.' `I have no fears. I understand you, Ned,' he said with a laugh. `You think I shall take a little something now and then. You see I comprehend your thoughts. But never fear for me. I only take a little when I am hunting, or such like. As soon as I get to the city, I shall stop with it. Yes, I intend to put my foot down and say done! I can leave it off when I choose. I shall be as steady as a judge in the city. Business men can't drink and be good for anything. I pride myself on my business habits. Never fear me Ned. A drop out of a flask when one is out a gunning isn't drinking at bars. That I never did. I never drank at a bar in my life.' `I am glad to hear it. It is bad enough to drink, Ralph; but when a young man drinks openly at bars he shews by the act that he is so far gone in intemperance as to be lost to all sense of shame; that his mind is stolid to the lynx-eyed penetration and unerring judgment of public opinion. As a friend let me urge you to abandon this practice at once. It will insensibly fasten upon you. You cannot throw it off at will. If you could have done so, why not have done so but now? I fear me, Ralph, your are farther committed to intemperance than you will admit, or than you suspect. The man who drinks alone and in private as you say you do, is the last to discover his own infamy. He walks in a mist, and thinks himself and his acts invisible. He believes not, suspects not, that men regard him as an intemperate man. He truly believes that his breath is not noticed by those he talks with. He deludes himself with the idea that his thick tongue, his unsteady gait, his garrulity and false hilarity are unnoticed. Because he tries to blind himself to what he feels is becoming a habit, and succeeds in doing so, he thinks that he has been as successful in blinding others. Now, my dear Ralph, take the advice of a friend from boyhood, and resolve not to become a slave to an appetite that is sure to bring infamy upon you. Now my dear Ralph, take the advice of a friend from boyhood, and resolve not to become a slave to an appetite that is sure to bring infamy upon you. Now few, very few know that you drink. You have followed it but a year. It is growing upon you. Three months ago you would not have drank before me as you have done to day. This insensibility to my opinion alarms me for you! You are going into the way of greater temptation. I beg you strengthen yourself at once against it, for each hour will weaken your power to do so. Before you all is bright and promising. Do be entreated, my dear friend, to give it up at once and forever!' Austin spoke with the warmth of a sincere friend, and with touching eloquence. Waldron's countenance had undergone various changes during his appeal to him; but he now replied with a light laugh— `You are too serious altogether, Ned! I know the evils of intemperance as well as you do. I should despise myself if I was an habitually intemperate man. What little I drink never effects me in the least.' `You said that it makes you strong.' `So it does!' `This is an effect. It will lead to more evil ones. This artificial strength as weakness under a mask. This continual tension of the cord destroys at last its elasticity.' `Well, well, my dear Ned, you are no doubt thinking you are speaking for my good. I ought to be angry with you; for you talk to me as if I was a regular toper. You had best take orders, for you seem well fitted to preach. Did you never drink in your life? `No.' `Not a glass of wine?' `Not one.' `Don't you know the taste of brandy or any spirit?' `I do not.' `It seems incredible.' `Why should it? Did you drink until the last year?' `No, not spirits, that is true. But then my father you know always had wine at table, and I always was accustomed to it from a boy with dinner.— Father you know is a gentleman of the old school; takes his glass of wine when he sees fit and loves a bowl of punch on Christmas eve.' `My father never had wine on the table while he lived; and my mother has educated me in the habits of the strictest temperance. A glass of cold spring water, Ralph, is more refreshing to my palate than could be the richest wines of Spain. It strengthens me too. It gives me a clear head and cool blood. I should fear to touch wine lest it should vitiate that exquisite taste given me by nature, by which a draught of pure water is rendered so delicious.' `Yes, mister Ralph, said Roundy with zeal; `I'd rayther have a pull at a gallon bucket o' molasses and water in a summer's day when I'm sweaty than at all the Champaigny and Derrymysherry as was ever uncorked.' Both of the young men laughed at the sally of Roundy, and shaking hands in a friendly manner they parted, Edward saying that he should probably go to New York also in two or three weeks to go into business. `That ar' young gen'leman, Master Nedward,' said Roundy, after they had walked on a little ways together,' seems to me to be fairly on the broad road to ruination. I'm beflambygusted, if I didn't see a young pimple seed a takin' root on the eend o' his nose. Then the little fine red veins like scarlet thread as looks as if thar was brandy in 'em, is beginning to sprangle on his cheeks. If he han't been takin' to liquor ony a year he's got ahead pretty fast.' `It's a pity, Roundy, a great pity. I've seen it growing upon him for some time. It is only lately he has openly carried a flask with him. It is a great pity and I fear the worst after he arrives in New York where he will be daily tempted. He has six thousand dollars to put in with his uncle, and it he was steady he might become a rich and useful man.' `It's nat'ral he should like it, master. He learned to taste the critter out o' cut glass bottles at his father's table. It he becomes a drunkard his father may thank himself.' `Mr. Waldron is a gentleman who has been a high liver, though never an intemperate man. In giving Ralph wine he never supposed he was creating a taste which in manhood would crave stronger stimulant. Children may love wine only, but when they become men and women they will have alcohol.' `Thank my father and mother!' ejaculated Roundy with a congratulatory sigh; `thank 'em for not bringing me up to love champaigne at dinner. If I'm a temperate man, Master Ned, I owe it to my broughten up and your good example!' `Yon had, it is true, little temptation to rich wines at your father's humble table, Roundy,' said Edward, smiling. `I can join with you in saying that I owe much to my parents also for my love of temperance. I can remember how my father, heaven bless his memory! inculcated upon my mind a disgust for drunkenness. He came into the house one day when we lived in the city and taking me by the hand said, `Edward come with me a moment.' He led me out the back-way into a lane in which was a tippling shop. He conducted me to a spot where lay a' man on his back half in the gutter half on the side walk. His clothes were in rags and covered with filth. His face was a scarlet black hue bloated hideously and turned upward towards the hot sun. His mouth hung half open and the saliva dribbled and puled down his cheeks upon his collar in a manner disgusting to behold. He was wholly incapable of helping himself and lay there with a dull idiotic laugh upon his marred visage, trying to sing snatches of vile songs with drawling, broken words, intermingled with drunken oaths so thickly articulated that I could hardly understand them. While I was looking at him with horror and disgust, a monstrous hog came rooting along and seeing him obstructing his way began to smell over him with his snout. When the drunkard saw him he stared at the brute with a half-conscious look and began to talk or rather to try to talk to it and expostulate with it for disturbing him. The hog, however, kept on smelling round him and then began to thrust his snout beneath him, under his back, as if to move him out of the way. But a fearful shriek from the drunkard showed that it was with other intention. The wretches hand, the fingers of which he had cut by falling on broken glass as he was kicked out of the shop where he had been made drunk, lay under him, and the brute smelling the blood had rooted under his back and seized it with his jaws. My father with difficulty caused the fierce and blood-tasting brute to release his hold, which he did taking off with his savage teeth half of the drunken man's hand. I never saw such a fearful sight—so fearful yet so horribly revolting. The man was taken to the hospital, but died from madness induced by the bite. Since then I have had a horror of every thing like drinking. Besides, Roundy, such terrible effects as these, it is sinful in the sight of God to brutalize ourselves and cloud our intellects. “No drunkard,” says the word of Truth, “no drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of God.” It not only degrades us here, but destroys us body and soul forever. Poor Ralph!' He placed his hand upon his heart and sighed deeply. `Poor, poor Ralph!' groaned Roundy, laying his hand solemnly upon his stomach. They now came near the house. It was an imposing mansion situated upon a sloping lawn and half hid in a grove of noble oaks, elins and chestnuts. Upon the portico stood a middle-aged lady with traces of great beauty in her countenance and the still elegant tournure of her figure. She was the mother of Edward Austin, a widow left with a good estate and this only son to inherit it. By her side stood a young lady of nineteen summers, for from her sunny looks all her years seemed to have been summers. She was rather small in figure yet exquisitely graceful, with a fair and brilliant complexion, in which were blent the most delicate tints of rosy health. Her profile was faultless; no Grecian chisel ever fashioned one so purely classical. Her motions were like those of a happy bird and each movement was an artless display of natural grace that enchanted, bewildered, and took captive first the eye and then the heart. When in repose her countenance had a pensive cast, and her deep blue eyes were sad and drooping as if tears hung upon the lids invisibly. At such moments, perhaps, she was most lovely. But when she was animated her eyes were full of dancing smiles, and a chorus of wild Cupids were heard in the tones of her joyous laughter.— Add to this a sweet voice full of all the tones of music, a gentle and loving heart, a cultivated mind balanced by good sense, and a small white hand of which she was very proud and ought to have been so, for it was a charming toy for a lover to play with, (and she had a lover!) and a bewitching little foot that seemed made expressly for waltzing and not for walking, and the portrait of Anne Laurens is complete. `You are a loiterer to night, Sir Angler,' said this maiden as Edward approached the steps; for she remained upon them to receive him demurely by the side of his mother, although if she had obeyed her heart, she would have flown to meet him when he first came in sight. As she spoke, a soft rich color deepened the pure tone of her complexion, and the lids of her conscious eyes fell, half concealing their expression, as if she feared she should betray too much of her heart in them. `Yes, Anne,' answered the young man modulating his voice into a cadence of singular delicacy and tenderness, that spoke to the bystander a volume of love between them; for need we say that Edward was her lover to whom we have alluded? The week before they had plighted troth. Anne was a sort of cousin to Edward—that, is, she was the daughter of a second cousin of his mother! a remote relationship, but one which the young man resolved, when he first saw her, he would spare no pains to make amends for by making her his wife it he could teach her to love him! Teach her?— Anne needed no tutor other than young master Cupid; for she fell irrevocably in love with her handsome fourth cousin, while he was so busily letting himself fall in love with her. Anne's father was a merchant in Pearl street, in New York, and a man of wealth; and as he was the executor of the estate of which Edward was the heir, he was under the necessity from time to time of visiting Mrs. Austin. The last time he came, which was about four weeks before our story commences he brought Anne with him; and at Mrs. Austin's earnest solicitation left her to make a visit of a month. This month the cousins had made the most of in bringing their little affair to a crisis, and before it was three quarters out they had come to a very satisfactory understanding with each other. At first they resolved to keep it a secret from every body till Edward, who was about to establish himself in business in the city, should be settled; but eyes, lovers' eyes in particular, are arrant tell-tales. They could not look at each other without letting every body see that they loved one another. So Mrs. Austin was not long mystified, and when Roundy roundly accused `Master Nedward' of being `dead smit' with Miss Anny, Master Edward saw it was useless any longer to keep a bird concealed in a glass cage, and he made a frank confession to his mother of the true state of affairs, and was made happy by receiving her sanction. `Yes, Anne,' said Edward, `I have not had much success to day. It is because you were not with me to select and fix my flies.' `That's it, Master Nedward,' exclaimed Roundy, `Didn't I see how fast you cotch'd the trout when Miss Anny baited the hooks. Lor! the fishes seemed to fight for the pleasure o' being caught with the flies what she put on. It shows their taste!' `Roundy, how can I ever repay you?' cried Miss Laurens, laughing.— `What shall I ever say to such a perfect compliment?' `Say to Master Nedward, (coz he'll do anything you say! (say he must take me to York with him when he goes.' At this request all laughed very heartily except Roundy, who looked perfectly grave aed serious. `Why, Roundy, they'd put you in the Museum and advertise you as `the fat gentleman,' said Anne. `And I should have to keep an omnibus for you to move about in, Roundy,' said Edward. `I could be of service to you though, Master Nedward. I've stuck to you through life since you dived into the trout pool and saved me from drownin', and as you saved me you've got to keep me with you. You know I axes no wages, ony the love of waitin' on you. Who'd brush your coat I warn't to know? or your shoes? or go your arrands? or call you in the mornin'? or keep you company when you fished? or—' Here Roundy burst out a crying and couldn't proceed for his sobs.' `Well, Roundy, as you are anxious to go with me, I will take you,' answered Edward. `I have been thinking of it before this; for I knew you would hardly consent to part with me.' `I may go with you?' eagerly demanded Roundy, brightening up and smiling through his tears. `Yes.' `Oh be joyful, Nicodemus!' he cried, leaping up and dancing round after the fashion of a waltzing elephant. `I'm goin' to York with Master Nedward! “Get out de way Ole Dan Tucker, You're too late to come to supper!”' `Why, Roundy, you're beside yourself.' `No, Master Nedward, I'm beside you, and mean to be beside you as long as I live. You've made me happy. Hurray! hurray! out o' the way old Bruce, and don't look so as if you thought I was makin' a fool o' myself. I don't watch trout in a basket as if they had wings and would fly off through the woods! I'm going to York and you are goin' to stay at home—that's the news and put it in your eye and cry.' `Edward, Roundy must have been drinking,' said Mrs. Austin, as he went skipping off towards the kitchen, followed by Bruce, to make known his good fortune to the servants. `No, The poor honest fellow is only intoxicated with joy. I am glad he is so easily pleased. I shall find him serviceable in the city, I dare say!' `I can't bear to her you speak of leaving, my son,' said Mrs. Austin. `It is quite time I should be in active business. I have been a year and a half from college doing nothing. `Nothing? You have given me your society and in a thousand ways contributed to my happiness. Is this nothing. You have been pursuing a thorough and useful course of reading. You have acquired the German and Italian, and elegantly ornamented the rooms with handsome oil and water color paintings from your own pencil? Is this nothing, my son?' `I feel that I ought to have done more. But I am content, dear mother, if you are! I am reconciled to it in the feeling that if I had perchance not have been an idler at home, I should not have been the proud and happy possessor of this sweet hand!' As he spoke he took the hand of Miss Laurens and pressed it to his lips with passionate devotion. They then entered the dwelling and after passing the evening in social conversation, varied by the music of the piano and guitar, Edward playing the first while Anne sang with the latter. Mrs. Austin assembled the household, opened the family Bible and read a chapter, a sentiment or two in which, after it was ended, led to a grave and pleasing discussion between Edward and his mother. A beautiful hymn was then sung, in which all joined, including Roundy, who was no mean vocalist. The clear manly voice of Edward, mingling with the rich tones of the maiden, rising above yet blending with the mellow notes of the mother, created a flow of divine harmony singularly appropriate to the hour and the occasion. The hymn being concluded all humbly knelt down, and Edward, with his prayer-book before him, offered up devoutly that excellent and comprehensive prayer composed for evening worship in families; a prayer that embraces all we need ask, whose petitions cover all our wants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. We have, in the preceding chapter shown our hero surrounded with the happiness of `home.' We have witnessed the manly integrity and virtuous firmness of his moral character, in his interview with Ralph Waldron; the kindness and affability of his nature in his unreserved intercourse with Roundy; the excellency of his character as a son; the purity of his devotion as a lover. We have seen him honored and loved, and the centre of the hopes of two beings, the dearest to him upon earth. We have borne testimony to his high principles as a man; and the temperance, truth and sound judgement he has manifested, have irresistably commanded our respect, and created in our breasts a strong and sincere interest in his future career.— Towards Waldron, his companion from boyhood to manhood, a young man of equal social rank, of equal education, wealth and advantages, our sentiments have instinctively been of an opposite description. Instead of commanding our esteem, he has inspired in us emotions of dislike. Yet two years, nay a much shorter period, before he would equally have challenged our regard and enlisted our interest. He had been, from his eighteenth up to his twenty-first year, the confidential clerk of his relative, Mr. Ward, a distinguished merchant in New York. He had gone with him, after he had graduated at that early age, at the request of his father, who desired him to become a merchant. As he had stated to Edward, he had assiduously devoted himself to his business, and won the confidence of his uncle. But being ambitious of political distinction, to which he saw that the bar was the chief avenue, on arriving at maturity he left his uncle, returned to his native place, a beautiful seat situated half a mile below that of Mrs. Austin, and entered upon the study of the law with that assiduity which had characterised him in his mercantile pursuit. Edward being at this time at home with his mother, their youthful intimacy was renewed, and Waldron was then worthy of the friendship of his noble friend. But this intimacy was destined soon to be impaired, and finally to terminate. Ralph had hitherto never freely indulged in the rich wines which it was his father's habit to have daily upon his table. He was temperate in the midst of temtation. But one day a fashionable young gentlemen from New York, a cousin, came to pay him a visit of two or three days. This person's name was Witt de Wittelsey, and he prided himself much upon his aristocratic connections. He was exceedingly dissipated, and had nearly expended a few thousands which had been left to him. Ralph, though he had seldom associated with him in New York, was gratified to see him, and they went hunting together, De Witt having brought a very fine blooded setter with him. It chanced, that being fatigued with rambling the woods, they came to a spring, at which Ralph proposed they should drink and refresh themselves. `Water? Pah!' ejaculated the young roue. `I have something here, Ralph, better than that,' and taking from his pocket the very flask Ralph had afterwards shown to Edward, he shook it with a gratified air. `This is my pocket pistol; I never go without it. One gets such detestable liquor in the country, a fellow can't trust himself ten miles out of town without preparing himself; come, Ralph, here is a bumper!' `Is it wine?' `No, pure Cogniac!' and he offered the brimming gobblet to the lips of his friend. `Thank you, De Witt; but I have never drunk any thing stronger than wine.' `Then you are a rare bird. Wine! pah! That will do for the women. Men drink something stronger! come, try it. It won't hurt you. It is of the color of ruby, and as smooth as olive oil. It was imported expressly for a clique, and is confoundedly expensive; but then it is nectar! Come, I'll set you the example; your health, Ralph!' And the young man emptied the silver cup which formed a cap to the flask, at a draught. `Now try one; it puts life into a fellow! come!' `I had rather not. If it was wine I should not object, though I drink wine only at dinner.' `If you are accustomed to drink wine, Waldron,' said Wittelsey, determined, now that he saw his friend was a temperate man, to commit him to intemperance, (for the drinker would have all drinkers,) `it won't harm you. One glass of brandy is not worse than two of wine! It will do you more good. Take it, or, by Jupiter, I shall feel hurt, and take it as a slight. It looks as if you was condemning me for what I conceive there can be no harm in!' `Well, I will to oblige you, De Witt,' answered Ralph with hesitation; and receiving the silver cup, he placed the draught to his lips; but finding it too strong he would have declined it, but his friend carefully pouring a part back into the flask filled it up with water from the cool spring, degrading God's free gift to the basest uses, and then the victim received it and drank it off. De Witt eagerly watched his countenance. `Is'nt it very fine? I am sure you will never drink flat wine after having tasted this?' `It is certainly very pleasant.' `I am surprised you never have drank brandy! I am proud in having the honor, my dear boy, of initiating you. You see I would'nt have urged you; but I knew how you would like it.' It is too strong to be agreeable; I prefer wine.' `You will soon get used to it; a mere tickle of the palate. To enjoy it, you should take it pure. Water spoils it.' The two young men proceeded homeward. Before they reached the house a shower came suddenly up and wet them thoroughly. Water does temperate folks no harm, but it is doubtless, dangerous to drunkards; for Wittelsey gave the shower as an excuse for taking something inside.— Ralph having once drank was the more easily persuaded to repeat the draught, especially as his friend assurred him, upon his honor, that unless he did so he would catch cold. But Ralph had had many a severer ducking than that without any injurious effects, and yet he had taking nothing to prevent them. De Witt's arguments were, however, irresistable. They were, virtually, `we must either take a cold or take a drink. A drink is far pleasanter, so let us take a drink. We can't take two things at once! Waldron drank with him, and without water, his cousin contending that they had quite enough of that fluid without, to put any in. So he drank with him, that he might not take cold; for there is a wonderful plausibility in the argument of a man who would tempt a temperate friend to drink; and he who listens is too apt to see their plausibility, and finally to sacrifice his own judgment and experience to the sophistry which seeks his downfall. So Ralph listened, drank, `and became as one of them.' Would he have yielded so easily if his father's wine cup had not gone before his cousin's goblet? From that day, during Wittelsey's visits, he constantly drank with him; for he loved the taste, and the after effects of the brandy upon 2 his blood and brain. It inspired him with an exhilaration of spirits and feeling, that was novel and delightful. It had upon him the effect, in some sort, of opium, and he enjoyed the state of high excitement and animation, which it induced. As this condition, however, passed away, with the exhaustion of the alcoholic virus, and left a corresponding flatulency of feeling, and dullness of mind, attended with a strange, indescribable weight upon the thoughts, he sought to restore the pleasing state, and revise his agreeable emotions by new draughts. Wittelsey had made him a present of the flask, and had promised to send him a demijohn of the brandy; a small one filled with his `nector,' being always carried by him in his trunk! After he left, Waldron took his gun to go to the woods, his flask in his pocket. He did not go so much to hunt, as to heat himself by exercise, and induce that fatigue, which would render, as he knew by experience, a pull at his brandy-flask, so refreshing and agreeable. After half an hour's walk, he sat down, fatigued, beneath a tree, and filling his cup drank it full, and with a sensible emotion of pleasure, that would have rejoiced the heart of Wittelsey, and made heavy the soul of the philanthropist. For a young man, first deliberately to fatigue himself to enhance the enjoyment of a draught of strong waters, and then retire to a secluded spot in the forest to drink alone, merely for the false animation and fatal exhiliration he knew it would produce, was a strong proof that the habit of intemperance had fastened upon his life with the fangs of an adder. It had truly became a habit, short as the time was in which he had formed it; for in four days any habit may be formed and interwoven into the character of the man, be the habit good or bad. Every person's experience will bear testimony to the truth of this assertion. The habit which Ralph had formed while Wittelsey was with him, was irresistably confirmed upon him in his absence; for he had said within himself, when he discovered he was liking brandy, `I will drink it only while he is here, and with him; when he is gone I shall abandon it!' But resolutions that are not strong in the temperate hour, are not likely to be after brandy has passed the lips; it takes a place within the man, and pleads for itself. Out of the mouth the monster has no power; within it, he is a subtle arguer on his own behalf; and strong in virtue and moral power, must he be who can resist him, and stand in his integrity as he stood before. A second time Ralph emptied his silver cup, and then proceeded homeward. As he was coming out of the wood, he beheld coming along the path, with his rods and wires, Edward Austin. Suddenly he coloured, stopped and looked around, as if he would have avoided the meeting. His looks were confused and guilty. Already he began to be sensible of his degradation. He was sensible he was considerably under the influence of what he had taken. He stopped and asked himself if he were not steady enough in step, and sober enough in countenance to meet his friend, without his suspecting any thing. He summoned all his self possession, and being conscious that his step was a little rambling, he affected a lameness to conceal any disposition to stagger, for the path had been for some minutes a little tremulous to his eyes, as he looked before him. Assuming then a bold, confident air, and thrusting a peppermint under his tongue, (a secret taught him by Wellesley to conceal the smell of spirits on his breath,) and limping a little, supported by his gun, he encountered his friend, whom, before this, he had never feared to meet eye to eye. `Ah, Ralph, have you hurt yourself?' asked Edward kindly. `Yes—a little; it is a mere trifle. Going a fishing, my boy?' he continued in a higher tone than was needful. `Yes. But why have I not seen you of late?' `Why, De Witt, you know, has been with me, and—' `But he has been gone a week!' `Yes; fine fellow he is, Ned you should have cultivated his acquaintance. You'd liked him!' `I did not like him. He seemed a very dissipated and unprincipled young man. His countenance showed intemperance in strong lines.' `De Witt takes a little—a little, but he don't make a practice of it; oh no! He's a d, d,—I mean a confounded cle—clever fellow! I did'nt mean, to swear, oh no!' Edward, by this time had discovered that his friend was under the influence of liquor, though trying to disguise it. His heavy, and yet restless eye, his flushed cheeks, and slightly thick articulation, confirmed this condition. He also inhaled the brandy-tainted air which he breathed. He was transfixed with surprise, and regarded him in silence, with mingled pity and amazement. Waldron saw, and rightly interpreted his looks. He would have said something to defend himself, but fearing he should betray his condition farther if he spoke, for he was a ware he had not the full control of his words, he pretended to feel pain in his foot, and screwing up his features, he said he must hurry home! From that time he avoided Edward's company, from a dread of exposing his habit to him, and from an instinctive feeling that he was not fit to associate with him. Drinkers like the society only of their kind; for they reproach not one another for alcoholic breaths, and have charity if a brother staggers, or utters his words thick. Edward, after meeting him two or three times more, and each time detecting the signs of indulgence, gradually withdrew from his society; and latterly when they met it was usually with a cold bow, or a few indifferent words. In the meanwhile the habit grew upon him. He neglected his studies, for drinking kept him constantly in a restless condition of the mind, and application became impossible to him. He took to reading books that would entertain and divert him from himself, and when these failed he would drink a glass of brandy and water. His habit he kept as secret as he could. He never let any one see him drink; and being always careful to disguise his breath, and to avoid society when at all overcome, he passed unsuspected, except by those who, like Austin, were not deceived in the appearances with which the wretched man, who finds his habit growing upon him, vainly and ingeniously strives to hide it from the world. Finding that he could not apply himself to study, he determined to return to business; and, conscious that his habit was becoming fixed, he hoped, (all hope so at first!) that he would be able to break it off by change of place and associations. He, therefore, opened a correspondence with his uncle, and Mr. Ward being wholly ignorant of the alteration in his habits, gladly embraced the opportunity of taking him in as a partner. Ralph had a thousand dollars, a legacy from an aunt, and five thousand given him by his father. This sum he intended to add to the capital. The day following the interview with Edward by the trout stream, he accordingly departed by stage for the metropolis. Edward had also determined to embark his fortunes in the city. He had at interest five thousand dollars, which with some other sums, amounted to about six thousand dollars. The villa with the land which he would inherit on his mother's decease was worth about fifteen thousand dollars, though it was still lying under a heavy mortgage, which had been existing since his father's death. To lift this weight from his inheritance, and increase his patrimony, he resolved to become a merchant. He had written Mr. Laurens to this effect, and received in reply such encouragement as determined him to proceed to the city with as little delay as possible. Anne Laurens left with her father a day or two after his return from his angling with Roundy, while Edward promised to follow in a few days. Mr. Laurens had no suspicions that his daughter had lost her heart during the four weeks he had left her with Mrs. Austin; although the knowledge of the facts would have gratified him a little; for he was well acquainted with the correct character and integrity of principle of Edward, and had more than once thought over the prospect of a match between him and his daughter. Perhaps, it was partly to favor this wish that he planned this visit to the residence of Mrs. Austin. They had driven but a little while along the road, after leaving the grounds of Hart-Hall, when Mr. Laurens assuming a dry manner, but with a slight twinkle in his eye, said `Well, Anne, you have had a pleasant visit.' `Yes, father.' `Mrs. Austin is a fine woman.' `Yes; I like her very much.' Having thus answered, Annette trembled, turned pale, and then blushed very deeply; for, thought she the next question will be about Edward.— And the next question was about Edward. `You saw something of her son? A fine young man. How do you like him?' `Pretty well, sir!' `Eh? only pretty well. Methinks he is a young gentlemen that might make an impression upon young ladies' hearts. Only pretty well?' `I think he is pleasant, sir!' `That is better!' `He is very agreeable at times.' `Is he?' `Quite so. He converses well.' `Does!' `I have hardly known a person who can render himself so agreeable.' `No!' `He is very handsome too!' `Ah, ah!' `And intelligent.' `And any thing more?' inquired her father with a quizzical glance out of the corner of his eye. `He told me he loved me,' she replied, blushing yet laughing and effecting a bewitching simplicity. `He did, ah?' `Yes sir,' she answered demurely. `And what did you reply, hey?' `That I also loved him very much.' `The devil you did!' `Yes sir!' `So you like him pretty well?' `Pretty well, sir!' `Ah, you minx, you have been making hay, I see! Well, you have behaved like a good girl. So he told you he loved you, and you told him so! What more happened?' `We promised to love each other till death, and be married as soon as my dear papa would give his consent.' `Very well put in. So you and Edward are engaged, Anne?' said he seriously. `Yes father,' she answered in a faltering voice, her eyes drooping, and sweet blushes mantling her cheeks. `Then I am happy. I wished this very thing. Edward is a noble young man, and will make you a good husband.' Anne embraced her father with grateful affection, and her eye brightened with pride and happiness. `But you will have to be content with being lovers a while,' he said gravely. `Edward has to get into business, and establish himself before he thinks of marrying.' `How long before it will be, do you think, dear father?' she asked demurely. `A year!' `A year? that is an age!' she said, clasping her hands together with surprise. `Well, be a good girl and perhaps we may say six months,' he said smiling. He received a kiss upon his cheek for this; and when he said it might be no more than three months, he was nearly smothered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. In one of those handsome streets that diverge from Broadway, in the vicinity of the Park, stands an edifice of an exterior somewhat imposing. It was the aristocratic mansion of an old family now represented only by a single person—a young gentleman with whom the reader will become acquainted. The house once stood alone in dignified exclusiveness, but blocks of dwelling-houses were now closely joined to it on either side, amid which it stood a grand old representative of the architectural luxury and elaborate taste of the days anterior to the revolution when the wealthy colonists aped royalty. It was three stories in height with a deep front, ornamented by a row of pilasters, with ionic capitals and crowned by an architrave loaded with ornamental carving. There was a row of lion's heads along the entablature, and above each window upon an arch was a grotesque human face. Over the massive and imposing door way was a coat of arms supported by griffin's claws and surmounted by a baronial coronet. The whole facade of the house was of a dark brown colour to which in many places time had added stains of inky black. Altogether this edifice was noble and striking to the eye and spoke eloquently of the days of by-gone colonial grandeur. The full moon, an hour high, was shining in broad, clear radiance upon its front, lighting up each detail of the architecture with the distinctness of noonday, when two young men, who had been walking leisurely down the side of the street which lay black in shadow, (half the street being buried in the dark shadows of the opposite blocks of houses) stopped over against it and looked carefully around them. `There is no one coming down now! Let us cross over,' said De Witt Wittelsey. `I had rather wait till those people pass who are coming up!' replied Ralph Waldron. `They are only labourers or persons you need'nt care for!' `It may be, possibly, men I employ in the store. I can't be too careful. I would rather wait, Wittlesey and go in some other night when the streets are darker!' `It is confoundedly light to-night that is a fact!' `A person entering any house, the opposite side of the way, could be recognized from people who might be at their drawing-room windows on this, as plain as in sun-light. As I go with you merely from curiosity, another night will do as well. I would'nt commit myself by being seen; for you know I am a business man now!' `True. But there is no danger! There, those men have got up by. Let us dart quickly across the way and we shall be in before any one can observe us!' Waldron glanced anxiously round at the curtained windows of the houses near him to see if any one was looking forth, and then taking his friend's arm hurried across the street with him. They hastened their steps as they emerged from the shadow that lay upon the half of the street into the moonlight, on coming into which Ralph felt as if a cloak hitherto concealing him, had fallen from his person, exposing him to the observation of every eye; for he was conscious that he was about to enter the door of the most fashionable and dangerous gambling house in the city; though its true character was only suspected by the world. They reached the door when De Witt grasping the massive knocker pulled at it as if at a bell handle when the door as if by invisible means was thrown open and as suddenly closed upon them. Waldron found himself in a neat vestibule, a small porter's room between the door and the hall beyond. The only occupant was a young man with very long light hair sweeping upon his shoulders in a rich profusion of curls,a light coloured mustache and imperial, effeminate blue eyes, a fair white complexion and a look of the most decided profligacy. His hand which was fair and delicate was loaded with massive rings, and a ponderous cameo set in massive gold adorned the fine linen folds of his shirt bosom. He was dressed in the height of fashion with an eye-glass attached to a fine-linked gold chain, a costly watch secured by a second chain of gold being thrown round his neck and crossing his vest, which was of blue silk spangled with stars in silver thread. He wore a gorgeous Chinese dressing robe instead of a coat, and was seated at his ease upon an arm chair with one foot elegantly booted stretched upon a little marble table that stood before him. He was, altogether, externally, the personification of effeminate foppery. His air and attitude were in perfect keeping with his appearance. But the expression of his countenance was in remarkable contrast with the gaiety of his attire. It was youthful and fair, but upon every lineament was impressed the stamp of finished vice. There was no crime that that young man would not seem to be ready to commit. His was a countenance neither to be loved nor trusted. `Ah, De Witt,' he said in a thin, violin-like voice, `You are here late!' `It is but nine o'clock, Virril!' answered Whittelsey in an indifferent tone, and with the air of a superior holding the person he answered in supreme contempt. The young man accustomed to such treatment from the rich and fashionable young gentlemen who resorted there, betrayed no other feeling at his manner than by slightly compressing his sharp lips and moving the corners of his mouth with a scarcely perceptible sneer of hatred. `Who have you with you? Does he wish to enter his name?' `No. Merely a friend?' `He will be trusted?' `I should not have brought him unless I knew so,' replied Wittelsey haughtily. `Open the door and let us into the hall!' `You have not given the recognition! It is required of all who enter whether known to me or not!' `True!' and De Wttt drawing off his glove placed the fore finger of the left hand upon a gold eagle that was fastened upon the centre of the little marble table. Letting it rest there a moment he carried the finger to his lips and then resumed his glove. Waldron saw all this with surprise. `This is the sign of the initiated' answered Wittlesey laughing. `None pass beyond that door who cannot give it, unless they enter with some one of the club!' The door-keeper then threw open the inner door and they entered a spacious central hall panelled and ornamented with very elaborate architecture. It was brilliantly lighted by a solar lamp placed upon a pedestal at the foot of a broad flight of stairs with a massive balustrade. The doors on each side of the hall were open and Waldron saw that the apartments were elegantly furnished. Young men were assembled in one playing at cards on polished tables lighted from above by suspended solar lamps, and in the other, on the left hand was a large table covered with crimson velvet and surrounded by a polished brass edge, around which several persons were gathered playing at some game the name of which he was ignorant. In the hall two or three young men were walking up and down and smoking. All were fashionable in their dress, dissipated in their air; and among them Waldron recognized many of the `young bloods' of the town. Ralph accompanied his guide through both of these rooms, lingering around the tables to observe the players and watch their varied success. `We will now go into the upper apartments,' said De Witt after they had made the tour of these rooms, the luxury and magnificence of which surpried Ralph; while he was astonished to find such a concourse of young men of the first families assembled here to play. Ascending the broad stair-case which was brilliantly lighted, they came to a second hall with doors leading into four apartments. There was but one of the doors open through which they passed into an elegant billard room where some half dozen young men were engaged at play, wearing gay Turkish smoking caps, and white linen jackets. Every thing aroung was luxurious and in perfect taste. There was neither disorder nor rudeness. Ottomans about the room invited to voluptuous indulgence. The floor was covered with a thick carpet that gave back no sound to the tread, and the windows were richly curtained. Upon a marble stone at one end of the room stood a silver salver with cigars upon it, for the use of the players. There was no appearance of wines in the room, nor had Ralph seen any below. `There are three more doors leading from the hall; are these gaming rooms also?' he enquired. `Not all of them. One is a private chamber belonging to the young gentleman, Frank Frankton, who keeps the establishment. You know that he inherited this house with a handsome fortune which he soon ran through with, and then mortgaging his house, he ran through with that. It all went in play, of which he was passionately fond!' `And how is it then that he dwells here and is proprietor of this splendid establishment?' asked Ralph with surprise. `I will tell you. He used to assemble his friends to play in his prosperity, having two rooms fitted up for this purpose; the apartment below stairs on the right where you saw them playing at brag, and this we are now in. Here he lived as a bachelor in great luxury and expenditure; and here his friends, and well-dressed black-legs whom he at times associated with on account of their deep playing, won his money from him and ruined him.— Finding his situation desperate he resolved on converting his house into a suit of magnificent club gaming saloons. You see what is! It has made his fortune! Every player pays him a certain sum for the privilege of playing, while each frequenter here subscribes yearly one hundred dollars.— His subscriptions amount to ten thousand dollars a year. He reserves to himself also a certain per centage on all winning over a hundred dollars.— He does not play himself much, as his passion seems to find food in the management of such an establishment!' `Does he pay no tax to the city?' `Not beyond the value of his property. The city are ignorant of its character. It is supposed still to be a private house where Frankton as formerly receives a good many friends to play and make merry. In fact it is known a club meets here occasionally! Its true character is suspected but by few!' `Yet I have heard of its existence as a fashionable gambling house.' `Yes, I know some people pretend more is carried on here than appears; but the public have never had their attention drawn to it. Every thing, you see is managed by a thorough system. Frankton is a perfect prince in his way. You saw the caution with which we were admitted. No man can enter here who is not a friend of some one of the club!' `Your account surprises me! It is a magnificent affair, and I can well conceive must attract all the rich young men in town!' `You see here the very elite!' answered Wittlesey with a patronizing look of ostentation. `Was that the proprietor below?' `Who?' `The pale young man with the gold chains and rings who let us in?' `He!' exclaimed De Witt with a tone of contempt, `Frank would little thank you for that compliment. The fellow you saw there has been a black-leg of the first water. He is Frankton's door-keeper and his tool to do whatever he chooses to command. I don't know why he employs such a wretch. But there is some mystery in it which leads Frankton to retain him about his person. He is vulgar and malicious. Why, the fellow can't even read or write his own name. The only literature he knows any thing about is contained within a pack of Crehore's cards. I said he could not read. Yes, he can read private marks in cards, and so skilfully, that no man will set down to a table with him, not even his own friends. So as nobody would play with him, perhaps out of pity to keep the devil from starving Frankton has taken him into his employ. He makes a good door keeper, and so does a dog!' Waldron smiled at this conclusion of De Witt's description of Virril.— They then together crossed the hall to a door which was closed. Waldron thought he heard the clashing of steel within; and the door being thrown open at a knock given by his companion, he found himself in an apartment in which two young men, striped to their waists, were boxing with gloves, and two others engaged in a spirited fencing bout, with foils. The room was hung with boxing-gloves, caps, foils,small swords; and even spears and sabres, formed a part of its garniture. `This is the fencing chamber!' said Wittlesey. `You see Frankton has every thing to please all tastes!' `It surprises me that I find no drinking here. I have seen nothing like wine in any of the rooms! Is it possible so gay a resort as this can be governed by temperance? Yet I am pretty confident some of the young bloods I have seen here are a little elated!' `Temperance does not exactly govern here, but it is regarded very strictly by Frankton, who will not allow any one to remain here after he becomes at all excited or noisy with wine. This is a rule of the place and is never set aside for any one. Tipsy people are noisy and cease to be respectable; and Frankton will have every thing respectable and quiet as you see. Come with me. There is one other room to enter!' The young merchant yielded himself to his guidance and they stopped before a door, which was partly open, and from which came sounds of music. De Witt threw it wide and Waldron stood still transfixed with astonishment. The room was large and grand in its height and breadth, and seemed to be panelled with mirrors multiplying themselves a thousand times to an infinite series of distances on all sides of the beholder. Between the mirrors were slender silver-gilt columns wreathed with vines and flowers exquisitely wrought, and colored to the life. The ceiling was exquisitely painted with classic groups of figures, and from it was suspended a gorgeous pyramid of crystal, blazing like the sun with a hundred lights. The floor was polished and ornamented with stars and borders in mosaic, the pieces being of colored wood. At one end of the magnificent room was a raised plat-form laid with rich carpets and surrounded by seats covered with crimson piled velvet and presenting somewhat the appearance of a private box at the theatre. In it were two beautiful girls not more than eighteen stationed before a white marble slab which run across the da's like a counter, upon which was displayed numerous decanters of sparkling wines, and silver and cut-glass goblets in dazzling array. There were beautiful little chased vases containing some cigars, others gilded paper-lighters for the smokers, and upon small silver plates were strewn the minute pellets of cachou aromatise for diffusing an aromatic flavor in the mouth and removing the taste and smell caused by smoking and drinking. These young girls were dressed in the most attractive manner, and used their smiles and glances as lavishly as Don Cupid shoots arrows. They were engaged in waiting upon several young men, handing them the fragrant cigars on the vase, or gilded paper-lighters, or the little silver plates of aromatic pellets with a grace, and air and wreathed smiles and bewildering glances that were in themselves dangerous enough, without the drinking and gaming, to ruin half the young men. Yet Waldron could see that they were but automatons, beautiful animated automatons, giving to all and each who approached their tempting mart, the same charming smiles, the same fiery glances! There were at least a dozen young men gathered around this shrine of Bacchus, where Venus presided with such dangerous fascination, the most of them with ruby goblets in their hands! `I had no need' thought Ralph, `to ask if wine were kept here! There is the crystal throne itself, of the sparkling god!' Music filled the air around him, and he looked to discern whence it came, but the source was invisible. It came in rich swells, a burst of instrumental sounds like the rising wind, and then lulling, was succeeded, in the calm that followed, by the richest female voice Waldron had over listened to!— Even the groups about the marble counter of wines ceased their talk with each other and suspended their gay speeches to the fair attendants, to listen. `This is a wonderful place, Wittlesey,' said Ralph after the voice and the instruments, mingling and commingling, had died away as if receding in the infinite distance which the eye seemed to behold in the perspective of the mirrors. `I knew you would be gratified to visit it, or I should not have urged you,' answered Wittlesey blandly. “Come, my dear fellow what will you take?' Wittelsey to do him justice blushed as he asked the question; for he knew that Ralph had before refused him saying that now he was in business with his uncle he was going to give up all spirits. This was true. Waldron had been in the city now one month and during that time, although with great difficulty, and hourly longing for his habitual draught, he had succeeded in keeping temperate. But the struggle had been a painful, a severe one, and for the first two weeks he thought he should have to yield to his habit.— Several times De Witt had sought his company, and in vain tempted him, laughing at his temperance! Waldron, however, was naturally resolute and strong-minded and remained firm with the strongest inclination to comply. His resolution was a reproach and reproof upon the habits of De Witt, and he felt it to be so. Therefore he secretly determined he would make him break it. There was a deeper motive. Wittelsey was greatly embarrassed for want of money, and he knew his cousin had six thousand dollars! `If I can make him drunk I can make him play!' he said to himself, and a truer saying was never uttered. He who drinks will play—will—nay there is nothing he may not be capable of doing; for reason is no longer at the helm and the man is driven by every wind of temptation whither his tempter leads, or his inflamed passions urge him onward. Wtttelsey reasoned well, and from deep knowledge of human character. `If I can make him drink I can make him play. If he plays I win his money!' From that moment he ceased not to press his attentions upon Waldron He began by taking him to the different libraries, the Historical rooms, and other like places to lull suspicion and with the pretence of introducing him to what was worth seeing and visiting, now that he intended to reside in town. He then, gradually approaching the point, suggested a visit to the B*** Club. `Merely a visit! just to drop in and see the place. It is truly a curiosity! You ought not to miss the opportunity of seeing it. Go with me to-night!' were the words of his tempter. So Waldron consented and went with him as he desired. But he was not a man of that pure and high order of morals which characterized Edward Austin. Ralph was in some sense a man of the world, and saw no great harm in fashionable amusements. He always liked the theatre, and had played billards. He felt no compunction in visiting a gaming house out of curiosity, provided he was not seen entering it. His only fault of character, he believed, had been his drinking, and in conquering and subduing this he feared no danger from any other source. He, therefore, did not feel shocked at the scenes he beheld here. They rather surprised but interested him.— Edward Austin, on the contrary, in the purity of his heart, and in the uprightness of his moral feelings would have shrunk from mingling in a scene where the laws of manly virtue and moral excellence, which alone make a man dignified and honorable, were suspended.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. Wittelsey repeated his invitation to Waldron, to join with him in a glass of the sparkling brandy that stood before them upon the marble table. `I have positively resolved never to drink any more spirits while I am in business.' `You won't refuse wine! That I know you are accustomed to. Vestris!' he cried, addressing one of the young girls, each of whom had a soubriquet, borrowed from some popular danseuse, `the decanters and goblets! The silver ones,' he said in a low tone. `We can drink more in them, as they don't tell us how deep we go, like the glass. You will take wine with me, Ralph?' `I have no objections to wine, though I drink wine only at dinner.' Wittelsey's eye sparkled as he filled his friend's glass, for he well knew that he who will take one glass will take two,and he who will take two has. by so much, weakened his resolution, and will be easily induced to take another; and he who will drink three glasses of wine, will not be found difficult to tempt to brandy, especially if he has had once a love for it. Wittelsey reasoned well, as the bad always do when they would tempt the upright to fall. Ralph being accustomed to wine at his father's board, thought no evil of it. He did not hesitate to indulge in it moderately.— Brandy was all he feared. He was ignorantly making a distinction without a difference. For he who loves wine will come to love that which is stronger than wine. The habit of drinking wine insensibly deadens the sensibility of the taste and palate, and to excite them, three glasses become necessary, where one will not produce the requisite sensation. But three or four glasses, the wine-drinker finds will give head-aches and dullness, and by and by, fail to produce the pleasant results they once did. To deepen his draughts drowns his senses and besots him! His only alternative is to substitute brandy for wines! This is a necessary and irresistable change. He finds one glass of brandy produce the effects that formerly was caused by a single glass of wine, and which now half a dozen glasses fail to bring about. He therefore drinks brandy, moderately at first, and oddly enough begins to think that, by the change, he has taken a great step towards temperance and moderation. But the one glass of brandy must of necessity, by and by, become two, and two, three, till the senses become paralysed, the eyes inflamed, the nerves unstrung, the hand trembling, and the whole man lives by an artificial stimulant irregularly and wildly coursing through the veins, arteries and nerves, in place of the pure fluids! feeding upon his very life, while it communicates life, in it are the seeds of death! If Ralph had never known wine, he would have been less easily tempted. It was because he drank wine he was prevailed upon by De Witt in their hunting excursion to try brandy. It was because he drank wine he now consented to partake with him! He drank and then the two young men turned away to walk up and down the room. At the farther extremity, seated in a luxurious arm chair, of purple velvet, borded with gold lace, and surrounded by three or four young men who were lounging upon ottomous and smoking, sat a person whose appearance at once struck Waldron. He was a man about seven and twenty, of great height, and symmetry of person, and an exterior of the most polished refinement. He had a noble head, covered with dark locks, and a profile whose outline was the perfection of manly beauty. His complexion was olive, and relieved by black arched eye-brows, and large whiskers, coal black and glossy as a raven's wing. His eyes were large, bold and penetrating, and his lips expressed decision and strength of character. But the expression of his face was repulsive. It was cold, heartless, artificial. He looked like a man relentless in hatred, and one who would arrive at whatever he aimed by any means whatsoever. This, however, was the deeper expression of his countenance and which he did not care should be read; and his habit was to conceal the true malignity of his character beneath smiles, and gentle-toned words, and an address of the most finished courtesy. Altogether he was a splendid looking man of the world, whose appearance in any Court ni Europe would be distinguished. He was in a sort of undress, being attired in a green silk robe, and wearing a green velvet cap with a gold braid and tassel. He was smoking a Turkish pipe, ornamented with chains of gold, and the fragrant perfume of the scented scarfalatti tobacco which he gracefully expelled from his lips, as he reclined in his luxurious chair with a lordly dignity, filled the room. He was talking familiarly with the young gentlemen around him, who were among `the first blood' of the city; men who would have disdained to acknowledge him in society, or recognize him in the street. `Who is that person, Wittelsey?' asked Waldron, as they arm and arm slowly approached him. `Not to know him is to be yourself unknown! why, my dear fellow, that is the immortal Frankton!' `The proprietor of the establishment!' `The same!' `I have seen this man in the street, and I thought he was some foreign Count.' `You could'nt compliment him more efficiently than by telling him so. He is as vain as— but I will introduce you. That's what I came this way for.' `Thank you, no!' answered Waldron, `I had rather not make his acquaintance.' `You must. Every stranger who enters here has to be presented to Lord Frankton. You need not fear his recognising you in the street. He knows well you would out him, and has too much pride to expose himself to insult. So you are safe.' `Ah, Mr. Wittelsey, you are welcome to-night,' said Frankton, without moving from his attitude of negligent ease, and fixing as he spoke, his gaze from under his dark brow closely upon the face of Waldron; that is, addressing the one, and bending his eyes upon the other! `Allow me, Frankton, to introduce to you my particular friend and relation, of whom you have heard me speak, (in uttering these last words he looked significantly at the proprietor,' who caught and returned his glance with a look of secret intelligence.) it is Mr Ralph Waldron. Ralph, this is Mr. Frankfort, the proprietor of B— Halls!' Ralph bowed, and so did Mr. Frankton, with a polished movement of his body, and a gracious smile. He then half rose and said, `Mr. Waldron I am happy to have the honor of seeing you. Allow me to introduce you to my friends here.' Frankton then presented him to each, and gave him a seat by his side. `Wine!' cried the proprietor to a black servant in livery, who stood behind his chair. It was brought upon a silver waiter, and placed upon a bronzed pedestal before him in the midst of the party. `Music!' he commanded in an imperious tone. All at once came swelling from some invisible source, the sweet instrumental music that had before enchanted Waldron. The same rich female voice rose and mingled with the instruments. He listened with delight, his senses bewildered and entranced. In the meanwhile, Frankton had filled the half dozen glittering goblets before him. `Mr. Waldron, we drink your health!' said he, as he raised a goblet, motioning to the others to do the same. Ralph drank with them, and then was engaged in conversation by Frankton, who had a wonderful talent to please when he chose to do so. He knew well whom he had before him. From De Witt he had had all his history previously; and the latter had bargained to give him one thousand dollars of the six thousand he hoped to strip him of, to have the use of his rooms to play in. Waldron was therefore in a net, against the toils of which temperance alone could give him power. But alas! temperance, that temperance which is temperate in all things he had not known! Wine to him was destined to become his ruin, as completely and as surely as brandy could have done. Frankton knew his man! Not an incident of his life or character that would aid his cause had Wittelsey omitted in his prior interview with the proprietor. `If he drinks wine he is ours!' was the positive reply, at the time, of the experienced Frankton. The wine was freely passed by the subtle and dangerous accomplice of Wittelsey, who remaining apparently indifferent, and having left the game in Frankton's hands, did not, for fear of exciting suspicion, or afterwards incurring any reproaches from his victim, once urge him to drink. But with the pressing politeness of the fascinating Frankton, the free companionship of the young gentlemen around, the swell of ravishing music, the voluptuous excitement of the novel place in which he found himself, with the magiclike and enchanting splendor of the surrounding scenes, all conspired to cause him to yield up his senses to the delusive joys of the hour. As a skillful physician watches the pulse of his patient to know the moment when to check the flow of blood from his opened veins, so the experienced proprietor of B— Halls, watched the countenance of his victim, to know precisely the moment to withdraw the bottle! As accurately as the physician knows the powers and uses of his medicines, so he knew what wines produces certain effects. Frankfort knew that a glass or two of sherry, followed by champagne and brandy, by making him dull and sullen, would produce a condition that would soon unfit his patient for play. He knew that a sparkling tumbler of champagne first administered, then madeira in one or two draughts, followed again by champagne, would produce precisely that condition most favorable to his object; a high degree of elevation of the spirits, extravagantly generous feelings, social amenity, and an open, acquiescing and reckless spirit, that yields itself with mad gaiety to any temptation that may be presented. Such was the condition of Waldron, when Frankton catching the eye of Wittelsey with a peculiar look of satisfaction, gave a sign for the glasses to be removed. `Come, Ralph, let us go in and see the players in the next room,' said Wittelsey, taking his arm. `Players! I have seen players and plays too, my boy!' answered Waldron, with his face full of smiles, and looking altogether perfectly happy, and being what Frankton termed very `prettily tipsy!' `Mr. Frankton, you —you are a gentlemen! You kee—keep good wine, and d— me if you an't a gentleman! if any man says to-to the con-con-con-con-con—never mind the rest o' the word—you know what I mean, my boy—I'll knock him down!' The proprietor looked savagely under his thick black brows, as if annoyed by this equivocal compliment, and Wittelsey hurrying him away, they entered a room where some young men were betting at roulette. Ralph as he walked, reeled `quite genteely,' swaying a little, but not absolutely staggering. He was precisely in a fit state to do any thing that was hinted to him; whether to kick up a row with watchman; tear off door-knockers; change opposite store-signs, or play! Wittelsey lead him before the costly silvermounted roulette table, with its green cloth, particolored spots, burnished and rapidly flying wheel. `Double O O, red!' drawled, as they came up, a young man with the thorough gambler's physiognomy, coarse and vicious; and at the same time with a slender rod, tipped with a silver hook, he swept towards a pile a stake which had been placed on single O red, by a young man who was the only one playing. `What game is this, De Witt?' demanded Ralph tipsily, and waving like a poplar swayed by a gentle wind. `Roulette! it is a fascinating game!' `How is it played?' “E-lev-en black!' drawled out, syllable by syllable, the gambler, and casting the while a quick furtive glance at Waldron, and estimating him, to use an expressive phrase of the `fraternity.' Of Wittelsey he only took notice by a slight half-nod; for this gentleman was well known there. The gambler, or `banker,' having pronounced the number, shoved from a pile of gold by his side, ten eagles, the player having staked upon the `eleven black,' fifty dollars and won. `You see how it is played,' answered De Witt. `These upon the cloth in the black and red coloured checks are certain numbers, duplicates of which you see are marked within the horizontal wheel in the centre of the board. An ivory ball is spun from the fingers of the banker as you beheld, and the wheel being set revolving simultaneously, the ball flies round and finally rests, when the wheel is stopped, upon one of the numbers in the wheel.— Now if you place a dollar down upon one of the red squares, say number 7 red, drawn on the green cloth, and the ball on being spun rests on number 7 red in the wheel you are the winner. Otherwise you lose. If you place your money on O O black or red, it is a law of the game that you win or lose thirty-six times (I believe it is,) the amount of your stake. I once saw a hundred dollars win thirty six hundred at this very table on those figures! Now watch the ball!' `Ten black!' monotonously sang the banker. `The money is on 9 black. He loses. If it had been on ten he would have won,' said Wittelsey. The banker extending his silver crook drew five of the eagles back to his pile of gold from which he had just before paid them out; but always, whether wining or losing with the same cold and indifferent look, and repeating the numbers in the same drawling, disagreeable, sing-song tone.— Wittelsey was closely and anxiously watching the countenance of Waldron. He had too much policy to ask to play the friend he intended to ruin. He was willing that wine should be his ally; and a true and faithful ally it ever is to the wicked and designing, as they well know. Waldron was just in that state which requires activity. The artificial fire and hilarity within him struggled for external action. He wanted to exhaust the feeling in outward excitement. This was the natural effect of undue inward excitement. Whatever, therefore, that offered him this activity, that promised vent to his exhiliarating impetus in his blood, he would instinctively and gladly embrace. There was no resistance, but rather a craving for free exercise and developement. The drinker at this stage cannot be passive. He must be doing. He must use his fierce powers. He must give full rein to his extravagant animation. Hence the midnight bouts with Charlies; the uproarious songs and mad frolies of homeward going bacchanals; hence the recklessness with which men rush to the gaming table! Such was the feeling that possessed Waldron. Wittelsey saw it working and struggling for action. If he had proposed boxing or fencing, Waldron would have here found an avenue for his surplus flow of spirits. But this was no part of his scheme. Without speaking his intention, Waldron in a very dignified manner, all at once drew from his purse a dollar and placed it after a second tipsy effort with a slapping emphasis down upon the O O red! Wittelsey saw this act with a joy he could ill conceal, and the banker observing his looks caught his eye and slightly vibrated his left eye-lid; for he instantly comprehended the whole matter. He cast the ball into the wheel and set it whirling.— Waldron watched the galloping motion of the little ivory coursed around his revolving circus with an earnest interest. It stopped. `Double O O Red!' called the man with some surprise. `By Heaven, Ralph, you have won!' cried Wittelsey. `If it had been a cool hundred now you would have got $3600 for your stake! You were born under a lucky star, Waldron.' `The star spangled banner and I are first cousins, my boy,' answered the young merchant, gazing upon his friend's countenance with a beaming smile of ludicrous tenderness. He then began to sing in a mellow voice `The star of love is beaming,—' `The wheel waits, Ralph,' said Wittelsey. `Waits, eh? go it little ivory!' he cried, winking funnily at the banker, and throwing his arm affectionately about Wittelsey's neck to support himself, for he swung backward and then forward like a pendulum wrong end up. `There it is again, double O O black!' said he placing the thirty-two dollars upon these figures in the black square. The ball went rattling and clattering around the flying circle and rested upon the answering number in the wheel. `Double O O black!' drawled the banker; and rapidly counting out thirty-two times the amount of his stake pushed it towards him. We will not follow out in detail this painful scene. Inspired by his two first brilliant successes, Ralph entered with all his spirit into the play, and at midnight, after two hours and a half play he was a loser of nine hundred dollars, for which he, with a heavy heart, for he was now perfectly sober, gave a check to Frankton; this person always keeping such blank conveniences in a room at the foot of the stairs, which he used as an office. The money won from him by the banker was to go to Wittelsey, according to the contract, the proprietor taking his proportion as bargained for, as well as the usual percentage. The next morning Ralph felt more miserable than he had ever felt in his life. He recalled as well as he could all that had passed, and groaned in spirit. At the moment of his deepest shame and regret, Wittelsey entered. Ralph wanted society and hailed his appearance with pleasure. De Witt seeing how he was, prescribed brandy and water, and sending to the bar, Waldron being at a hotel, he persuaded him to drink it. He soon felt better, and the blues of remorse vanished. From that day Waldron began to descend. He was prevailed by De Witt to try to recover what he had lost by betting at other games. He alternately lost and won, but still inspired by the hopes of winning all back he nightly resorted to Frankton's; nightly drank deeply, and played heavily, and each night involved himself deeper and deeper. At length he drew the last dollar from the bank which he had placed there but two months before, (for only that length of time had he been in the city,) to be used by the House whenever the sum should be required for certain contemplated transactions. At the same time he addressed Mr. Ward the following brief note. Howard Hotel, Nov. 5, 1842. `Sir,—Having withdrawn my money from bank, I withdraw myself from the firm. Ask me for no explanations; for I have none to give. I have chosen my own course and must abide by it. Ralph Waldron. Poor Waldron had indeed chosen his own course, and sadly did he abide by it, as will be shown hereafter.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">3 CHAPTER VI. We now return to pursue the career of our chief hero, Edward Austin. He had arrived in New York about three weeks after Ralph; and as he had come for the purpose of looking round for the most advantageous mode of investing the few thousand dollars he brought with him, he put up at the Howard House as being more likely there to fall in with men of business, and so become acquainted with the best avenues for commercial adventure. Anne Laurens was in town at her father's when he arrived, and his first visit after taking possession of his room and carefully making his toilet was directed, of course, to the residence of Mr. Laurens in Carrol Place, Bleecker Street. It is unnecessary to give the particulars of the kind and flattering reception extended to him by Anne and her father. The latter, who now began to feel an interest in him that was paternal, soon after proceeded to enter upon a conversation with him touching his prospects; to which Miss Laurens was by no means an uninterested listener, her eyes all the while being scarcely removed from the face of him she loved. Edward, happy in her reciprocal affection and in the approbation of her father, conscious too of his moral worth and integrity of character, felt her bosom glow with grateful joy and calm peace as he sat together with them, the father on his right the daughter on his left; for Anne, laughing, had said she would take the place nighest his heart! `You have six thousand and eight hundred dollars, Edward!' said Mr. Laurens. `Well that is a fair beginning for a young man in a city like New York. In two years you ought to double it. What kind of business are you inclined to?' `I have no particular penchant that I am aware of! I will let Anne choose,' he answered laughing and glancing at the blooming girl by his side. `I should choose some business that would'nt keep you much away from me,' she said blushing at her own frankness in thus anticipating when she should become his wife, and as such covet his society. `I don't know of any, girl,' answered her father with a smile in the corner of his eye,' unless he opens a man millinery in Broadway, you keep in the back shop and Edward in the front!' `Father, how can you?' cried the maiden rapping his cheek lightly with her fan. `I shan't say any thing more, but let you and Edward settle it together!' `We will allow you a casting vote, Anne,' said Edward with a playful look. `The truth is, Mr. Laurens, I have a notion I should like the business of a French importing house! But I fear my little capital would not go far in such a business!' `It is a good business, my boy; a good business; though, as you say, it requires a large capital. You speak French. This will be of great advantage, as you can then visit France and select your own goods. I have no doubt that you could find a good Importing House that would take you as a junior partner with what money you have, and give you that part of the business which lies in Paris!' `I should like this but for one reason,' he said hesitatating and looking at Miss Laurens. `What is this?' demanded the old gentleman half guessing what it was from his looks. `The deprivation of the society in which I now find myself so happy!' `Oh, I see! You don't want to be separated from Anne! Well, perhaps, we could fix that! The girl might like to see Paris, too! Hey, Anne, you rogue!' `It is just as you say, dear father,' she answered demurely, her depressed eyes tracing out the figures upon the carpet.' `Just as I please. It would'nt have been just as I pleased, if I did'nt want you to marry Edward! It would then have been just as you pleased! well, I am glad it is just as we all please, Anne, my dear! You shall go to Paris if Ned goes! Come, now don't look so like a full blown peony. Kiss me and tell me you have got the most indulgent and loving father in the world!— Don't make a mistake before you get past Edward and kiss him instead!' `Father! father!' she cried pressing her small hand over his lips and silencing him; `you must think—' `What do I think. I think you are the handsomest girl in the Empire state and Edward, the young dog, ought to be as proud of you as, as— don't smother me with kisses! there, that will do, I won't plague you, child.' `I am proud of her, my dear sir,' answered Edward with an enthusiasm that filled her young bosom with pride and joy; `I know not how to be properly grateful to you, sir, for your indulgence and favor. It shall be my endeavor to make myself worthy of your confidence and to render her life happy.' `A very pretty speech, my boy. I know you will make her happy. Plato!' he called to a servant with a jet black skin and a grey head, who was passing out of the room which he had entered to replace some articles in the side-board. `Sir!' `Put out that decanter of Paulding's Pale I opened for judge Williston when he dined with me yesterday.' `Yes sir,' answered the African with a polite bow. I will see two or three friends I have in the line of French Importations to-morrow, my boy, and I think in a few days I shall find you a House that will please you. In the meanwhile you can look round for yourself, and you can refer to me if you choose!' `Sir, you are very kind,' answered Edward. `Poh, poh! don't thank me for what any body would willingly do for you. You are a young man of pure character, upright morals, sterling integrity. I know it to be true, so don't blush as Anne here does sometimes. Ah, girl, your eyes dance like diamonds! so you like to hear him praised!' `The wine ready, sir,' answered the negro, placing upon a small Chinese tripod, a chased silver salver containing a glittering decanter filled with the most delicate amber-colored Sherry, and three wine-glasses of the most delicate form. `Come, Edward, said the retired merchant, taking up the crystal decanter and laying the massive stopper upon the salver,' let us take a glass of wine to Anne's visit to Paris as your wife; and to your success as a Merchant! Ah, this is a delicate flavor,' he added, pausing to inhale it with that exquisite sense of enjoyment which characterizes the connoisseur; `this importation of Paulding's is superior to any wine that has crossed the seas for many a year; not since that of the great earthquake vintage!' `I have heard of such a vintage, also of Comet wines, sir!' said Edward, `is it true that such circumstances really effect the grape from which the wines are made?' `Yes; at least such is the impression; but to be frank, I have little faith in the influence of comets and earthquakes upon wines! It has chanced that in such years, the wines have proved unusually good; and that is as likely to be owing to accident as to physical phenomena. Come, Edward take your wine!' added Mr. Laurens, who while he was talking had been filling the three glasses before him. Anne, my dear, here is yours!' `I will take but a sip, father,' she answered, receiving it in her hand. `You dont take yours, Edward! We are waiting for you!' said Mr. Laurens raising the sparkling wine-glass, and reaching it towards him. `Thank you, sir, but really I have never drank wine in my life,' answered Edward blushing and stammering. `I know your mother has brought you up with very temperate habits.— But a glass of this pure wine will do you no harm! I wish you to taste it, for if you have never drank any wine, I desire that the first you taste should be pure and delicately flavored. Try this, and as you are so temperate, I will not tempt you again! You see Anne is not afraid to drink it!' `I should rather be excused, sir;' hesitatingly answered Edward who, to keep Mr. Laurens from holding out his hand, had taken the wine-glass from him, and now held it with an uncertain grasp between his fore finger and thumb, while the image of Ralph Waldron rising painfully to his mind nerved him to a firm refusal. `Anne will have to challenge you, I see, said Mr. Laurens laughing.— `Come, girl, pledge him to his success as a merchant! I will pledge him to drink to you as his bride!' `Edward will you accept my challenge?' asked Miss Laurens with a smile. `What I could refuse to your father I have not the firmness to refuse to you,' he said reflecting her smile in his eyes as he gazed upon her with mingled love and tenderness. `I will drink to you Anne with pleasure, but to tell the truth my mother has instilled into my mind from earliest youth such a horror of intemperance, that I have hitherto looked upon a wine-glass, as if I saw labelled upon it, `Poison' like vials in an apothecaries shop. But I will this once accept your pledge. It is my first and my last glass of wine.' `That is a good resolution, Edward,' said Mr. Laurens. `If you have such feelings, I am the last person that should encourage you to depart from them. But I do not fear you. You are too well grounded with your principles to be in any danger from the wine cup. Here, my boy is to your success as a merchant, and to your happiness, my dear Anne, as his bride!' Mr. Laurens emptied his glass slowly and with that lingering relish of the wine which is the peculiar habit of amateurs. Anne slightly tasted her glass and replaced it upon the salver. Edward also lifted his to his lips, but to taste; but had no sooner let the rich, insinuating flavor of this exquisitely soft beverage of the grape come in contact with his palate than, taken by surprise at the unexpected delicacy of its taste he suffered it to flow and dissolve over his palate, indulging, with irresistible delight the new sensation. Startled suddenly at the consciousness of yielding to the dangerous gratification of the sense of taste, and alarmed at the thought how easily he might come to love wine, he abruptly put down his glass and with such vehemence that the slender stem snapped off, and the wine, for he had but half emptied the glass, and the fragments of shivered crystal were mingled upon the shining salver. `I am exceedingly awkward,' he said confused, yet feeling a great relief, as if from a temptation, on seeing the glass fall. `Oh, it is of no consequence,' said Mr. Laurens. `What a charming odor this wine throws out as it evaporates! I will fill for you again! You hardly have had taste of its flavor!' Plato on seeing the glass break, flew to the side board and immediately replaced it with another, which Mr. Laurens now filled. `The wine seems to me very good,' answered Edward `but I will take no more! I am of course no judge of wines!' `If it pleases your palate, you are as good a judge as any body! It is not so difficult to say whether good wine is good, but to decide upon wines, the credit of which is not yet established!' `You are very fond of wines, sir! `Yes; though I do not drink much. I am only a table-drinker! do not recollect that I ever drank a glass of wine, and certainly I have drank nothing besides wine, except at dinner, or in the evening socially as we are taking it now, in my life. I have been in the custom of taking a glass or two of sherry after dinner ever since I kept house. If by any chance I do not have it, I suffer with indigestion. But, my boy, though I do not think there is any harm in a glass of wine at table, I would not recommend you to follow the custom; for it is a habit and all habits sooner or later, get to be so a part of ourselves, that they become quite vexatious to one. Now, in travelling, when by any chance I dined without being able to have a glass of wine after, I have been out of sorts all the rest of the day, and to tell you the truth, in down-right ill humor! If I was not an old man I would try and break it off; but I can recommend you not to let any thing become a habit with you except prayer, going to church and reading your bible! Good habits will become a part of your character and in a young man of right principles just as easy as bad ones. So, my dear boy, you have my opinion, and now take your glass and drink to your good habits!' If Edward smiled at the abrupt transition of Mr. Laurens in his address, in recommending to him the habit of prayer and church going, he felt quite as much surprized and amazed at the conclusion of his discourse. Anne saw at once the impression upon his mind and catching his eye smiled and said: `I see, Edward, that you think father has a very odd way, after giving his advice, of enforcing it! Father does not consider there is the least harm in a glass of wine, he has so long been accustomed to it; and he regards it as an old fashioned custom that ought to be held in esteem. I hope you will not think he holds lightly your strict temperance. I assure you, that although I have never held a glass of wine taken with my father, at all wrong, I should be the last person to wish you to break a resolution!' `I have never made a resolution not to drink! I have never made a resolution not to lie nor have I that I will not swear nor steal! I have been educated and grown up with precisely the same moral feeling with reference to intemperance that I have in regard to these vices. Against neither the one nor the other have I formed resolutions; for there is a higher sentiment within which I feel will protect me from ever indulging them! In tasting this wine, Anne, I have broken no resolution; otherwise I should not have lifted the glass to my lips. In tasting it with you, I have not felt, nor do I feel guilty of intemperance. I cannot by any means, associate that vice with this social scene.' `You have said well, my boy! I admire your sentiments. You are in no danger of ever being a wine drinker, I see plainly. I am glad of it. There are great temptations in this city to young men, and especially to young merchants who must often dine and wine their heavy customers. Empty your glass. You quite lost the other. I want the opinion of a fresh palate upon this wine!' Edward smiled, and partly because he would again enjoy the novel and exquisite flavor which still lingered upon his taste, partly to gratify Mr. Laurens, and partly to show him that he was not afraid of becoming a winedrinker he raised the sparkling glass, and brought it gently to his lips. `It is indeed a most winning beverage, sir. Is all wine so palatable?' `No, by no means! This is a rare `seal.' I am glad you are pleased with it. I have but a few bottles of it. This one I opened and decanted yesterday for Judge Williston! The Judge is a great connoiseur! well, touching your business affair! I will not fail to have it all arranged for you. There are my friends, Mordent, Godine &amp; Co. in Pearl St. I think they are the very House! Drop in and dine with me to-morrow and I will tell you what I have done for you!' The conversation now passed from subject to subject, and as Mr. Laurens, at pauses in it would raise his wine-glass to his lips and sip, so Edward, who held his, dallying with it in his fingers, from time to time insensibly found himself imitating him; till, at length, after the lapse of a quarter of an hour, Mr. Laurens seeing it nearly empty, pushed the decanter towards him, saying, laughing, `I see you like my wine in spite of yourself, my dear boy! Try another glass. It will not hurt you!' `I was unconscious that I had emptied my glass,” said Edward colouring, and looking at Anne, he added, `I tear, Miss Laurens, you will not give me credit for consistency; but really, in the excitement of conversation, I was not aware that I was stealing the wine so insinuatingly from my glass!' Edward had well said `the excitement' of conversation; for he had talked with unusual enthusiasm for him. The deceitful influence of the hightoned wine had insensibly quickened his blood and elevated his spirits, and lessened the rigid and habitual guard which he kept over himself. He did not utter one word out of the way, or betray any undue levity; the effect of the glass and half he had drank was only visible in a certain energy in his expressions and a sparkling gaiety in his eyes. Mr. Laurens only thought him clever and more entertaining than he had supposed him to be and Anne, without once suspecting the true cause, thought he looked and conversed much more interestingly than usual. The evening passed away, and Edward, fairly refusing to replenish his glass, took his leave and returned to the Hotel. He did not return to bed without an unpleasant sensation of regret that he should for the first time in his life, yield, though moderately, and in the presence of his betrothed bride and her father, to an indulgence, for which he had reproved and despised Ralph Waldron. `But then,' he said in self acquital as he laid his head upon the pillow; `it was brandy that Ralph drank from his hunting flask!' The ensuing day Edward went early to his appointment with Mr. Laurens that he might have an hour with Anne in the drawing-room before dinner. It was an hour of pure and unmixed happiness. There was no allusion made to the events of the previous evening; for to Anne's mind they had not again recurred, she not not having regarded his light indulgence as worth a moment's after thought. Edward also had ceased to let it trouble him. They talked of his future prospects—of the probability of a voyage to Europe, of the fascinations and pleasures of the gay metropolis of France; and above all and with all of their marriage, which both hoped would be soon. Both were perfectly happy; both virtuous, honorable and good; and there seemed to the eye of hope nothing visible in the bright vista of the future to cast a cloud over the silvery horizon of their loves! At dinner Mr. Laurens informed Edward that he had seen and spoken with the French Importers, Mordent, Godine &amp; Co. `I represented your wishes and views to them; and they expressed themselves gratified at the opportunity of availing themselves of your proposition to join them in business. They said that their present junior partner, who had been in Paris some years was about returning to America for his health; when he would withdraw from the firm, and that as he was looked for in four or five weeks, if you would wait until then, they would be happy to have you supply his place both in the firm and at Paris. In the meanwhile, they added, that you had best call and see them, and remain as much time in their store each day as you saw fit, to become acquainted with the style of goods imported, and the other duties which would be required of you! so, my dear boy, you are fixed without any trouble. This is one of the heaviest houses in the city, and the Firm is composed of two of the best men I know of. Let me congratulate you on your good luck.' Edward expressed, in very warm terms his grateful sense of what Mr. Laurens had achieved in his behalf; and Anne was not backward in thanking her father and in manifesting her happiness; for this favorable turn of affairs would sooner bring about their union, as it was a settled matter that if Edward went to France he should be married and take Anne with him. Mr. Laurens could not let this happy adjustment of so important an affair pass by without celebrating it by a bumper and so filled their wine-glasses: `But half a drop, my dear father!' said Anne with eyes sparkling with joy. `And less than that for me, sir!' said Edward; but ere he checked the decanter, his glass was already running over. `Nay, you must not be too rigid, my boy on such an occasion! Here is health and happiness to you both my children! God bless you, and never let the sunny morning of your lives be clouded by a single sorrow!' As he spoke thus feelingly, he reverently, while a tear glistened in his eye, placed the wine-glass to his lips. Anne and Edward instinctively followed his example, and in silence they drank to this touching parental benison! Not to have done so, Edward felt would have been like refusing his assent to the blessing invoked upon him and Anne; and thus the act became, as it were, invested with a sacred sentiment in his eyes! Daily for some weeks, Edward was a visiter at the mansion of Mr. Laurens; and often he found himself a guest at the dinner-table, sometimes alone, but oftener with company—two or three friends of the merchant. The few glasses of rich wine he had imbibed had given him a relish for its peculiar flavor; in a word, he had not dined a third time with Mr. Laurens before he found himself filling his own glass from the decanter and pledging Anne to drink with him. Less than three weeks it certainly was not, before Mr. Laurens had only to push the decanter across the polished board to him with a nod to refill! and ere a month elapsed, Anne, as one day she left the table, had to give him a gentle warning look of caution in indulging, to which he returned a gay laugh, and replied, while he blushed, `Never fear, dear Anne, it is only your father's wine I love!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. At the end of several weeks, a letter was received from the junior partner of the French House, for whom Edward was waiting, saying that he should not leave for New York under ten days, when, on his arrival he should close up his affairs with the firm and withdraw from it. During the interval of delay, Edward continued diligently to pass four or five hours, in fact, every forenoon in the counting-house in Pearl street, devoting himself to the details of the business upon which he contemplated entering. But during this period he also frequently visited at Mr. Laurens' mansion, and there formed the dangerous habit of taking wine at dinner. Nor was he blind to this fact of a growing habit. `I will leave it off altogether,' said he to his conscience, `as soon as I form the connection with this firm!' He had been, when he said this, for some weeks under this influence of social table-drinking, and it wanted three weeks to the time of the arrival of the gentleman whose position he was to take. It was on the evening of the very day on which he had made this resolution that he left the table of Mr. Laurens a little flushed with the generous wines of his cruelly hospitable and thoughtless host, and sought his rooms at his hotel at an hour earlier than was his habit, from a painful sense that his step was unsteady and might betray him; and at the same time with a feeling of shame so deep that he inwardly resolved that he would never take another glass of wine! But resolutions made in a state of partial inebriation are no oftener regarded in sobriety, than those made in sobriety are heeded `when the wine is in.' On his way to his room he passed a half open door at the head of the hall which he knew to be the servant's waiting room. Hearing his own name spoken as he passed he checked his steps and listened, supposing he was called. `I can't do it now, and so don't try and tempt me with the tarnel kritter,' said the well known voice of his `valet' Roundy Beebe. `I never drink'd nothin' stronger nor water, 'cept it mout be milk, and I don't mean to nuther, till I has more orakkler evidence as my master Edward drinks than your word! Ven he tipples, I Roundy, tipples; so long as he's sober, I keeps sober. He's my model pattern for time and tarnity!' `You need'nt be afther makin' sich a pother, spalpeen,' answered a rich Irish brogue, which Edward recognised as belonging to the second porter; `I did but in kindness offer ye a bit o' the whiskey, as kapes the life in me shoul and body. But if ye only wait till Misther Edward dhrinks, its meeself as can pruv it to ye, Roondy. Not that I'd guv a stiver to tempt the likes o' ye to be afther dhrinking; ony whiles we are kapin ach odther company here till yer masther comes home, or I have a call, I'd like to make it plisint and sociable to both of us.' `If you don't prove my master Edward drinks, I'll knock you down, that's what I will!' answered Roundy very positively. `Its niver yer two fists I'd be afther mindin' at all, honney; but misther Edward ordhered a day-kanther o' wine yisterday for his dinner, for I stood behind his chair, and was the viry lad as he bade go fetch it til him!' `Is it true, Jemmy?' `De'il a bit lie in it from top to toe. I'll tak mee sackrament oath on it!' `And did master Edward drink it?' `To the full o' four glasses!' `That's what I never'd believe! I'll not believe it neither, till I see him. Now if he'd only let me wait on him at his dinner, he'd never sent for it, and I'd never got it for him. I'd said to him, master Edward remember your mother, and don't forget that flask tippler Ralph Waldron, you used to talk to. Don't, dear master, get to taking to the ways of this wicked city,— which I wish I was well out of, Jemmy; for if the horrid satan don't reign here he beant no wheres on airth; oh, dear me, Jemmy, if master Edward has got to takin' wine, I fear its all up with us.' Edward did not feel in the mood of hearing more, and passed on to his room, with feelings of the deepest chagrin, and a sense of humiliation, that for the moment made him feel inferior to his own servant. He shut his door and paced thoughtfully up and down his chamber. He had received from Roundy's words a cutting reproof. It led him to view his true position, and to confirm and strengthen his resolution not to drink again. Roundy in a little while came to his room. `Ah, so you are comed home, Master Edward,' said Roundy, looking at him very hard; for Edward's face was flushed, and the lids of his eyes heavy while the pupil was unusually bright. Roundy also very plainly scented the fragrance of wine, and his suspicions already aroused by Jemmy, he resolved to ascertain if his master had been really drinking; for he thought he looked very like it, `Roundy you may go, I don't want any thing to-night,' said Edward quickly, fearing he might discover what he wished to conceal from him. `Yes, master Edward, but the window is up. I will shut it.' `I just threw it up myself. Go!' Roundy stood a moment with his hand upon the door, as if he wished to ask something. Edward fearing that he would question him about taking wine at the table, and being in no mood to be interrogated, even by this simple-minded young man, he repeated peremptorily his orders for him to leave the room. Roundy obeyed; but as he closed the door he sighed heavily, and said to himself, `I see how it is. He never was so before; his eyes are red and he speaks sharp. I see how it is! I smelt the wine as plain as if a demijohn was in the room. I fear Master Edward is got into temptation in this Babylonist city of distinction and ungodly doin's. But I won't guv up. I'll see if he don't get over it; and if as how as he does't why I'll drink too; coz if master Nedward goes to the devil, I'll go with him. So there'll be two of us!' The next morning Edward awoke with a sense of shame and self-reproach. The resolutions he had made the night before he now solemnly repeated, and kneeling by his bedside fervently implored the divine guidance. Roundy as he came in to wait upon him appeared sad, and silently performed his duties about his person. `Roundy,' said Edward as he was tying his scarf, and speaking in a pleasant tone. `Master Nedward!' responded Roundy with a profound sigh. `What makes you so silent this morning?' `I was thinkin', master Nedward.' `Thinking?' `Yes, master Nedward,' and Roundy sighed again, more heavily than before; indeed, his sigh partook of the character of a groan. `And what was you thinking about?' `Whether I should get drunk on whiskey or heavy wet,' replied Roundy In a very triste and sorrowful tone. Edward understood at once the drift of his meaning, and could not help laughing very heartily. `Ah, I see how it is, Roundy. You think I have been setting you a bad example. The truth is, I have taken a little wine at dinner lately with a few friends, and only to oblige them.' `But, master Nedward, Jemmy says you called for a decanter when you was dining alone. If it was only with friends and stopped then, there might be hopes of you; but when you likes it so well as to drink by yourself,—' `That will do, Roundy,' interrupted Edward quickly in a displeased tone. `I did not bring you to the city with me to be my mentor and to watch and rebuke my conduct. For the future hold your tongue. I shall drink no more wine, so do not trouble yourself and take on as if I was already a drunkard.' He finished his toilet in silence, and Roundy did not again open his mouth, though at intervals he would sigh very heavily, and from time to time slowly shake his head in a manner ludicrously desponding. The habit of taking a glass of wine at dinner was only confined to the table. Edward never thought about it except at the board, and, therefore, he had full confidence that he should never be tempted to indulge in it to excess. `Nevertheless,' he said, as he left his hotel to go to his counting-room; `nevertheless, as it is becoming a habit, and the love of it may fasten upon me, I will give it up hence forever; though I have no apprehensions, that by continuing to take a glass or two with my dinner, I should do myself any injury. I do not think even Anne would tempt me to drink wine again.— But there is no danger from this source; I see already that she trembles to leave me at table with her father, though she has not spoken to me save by eloquent looks that she thinks I may indulge too freely. Yesterday afternoon I did take more than I ought to have done; but as Mr. Laurens' friends were politicians and drank political toasts, I could not refuse but with ill grace. I would no longer say what I could have said a month ago, `I never drink any wine!' I wish from my soul I could say so now. But 'tis past, and I must now substitute resolution for a principle! This is a sad falling away!' His features expressed regret and mortification, and with a troubled mind he sought his place of business. On his return to his hotel he was surprised and gratified to find Mr. Lanrens waiting to see him. `Ah, my dear Edward, I have called to invite you to accompany us to see Macready in Hamlet to-night. I have been to secure seats for three. You will be up and take your tea with us, and let us start early for the house will be crammed.' `I assure you I consent with great pleasure. But you will not go home now. We dine now and I must have the honor of your company. In catching you here I hold you as a rare prize.' `Well, to tell the truth I half made up my mind before I came in to dine with you; so you have me without much pressing.' `You are very kind. After dinner I will ride up with you.' `That is my plan, also. There is—' What further Mr. Laurens was about to say was lost in the loud roar of the gong which resounding throughout the vast hotel seemed to shake the massive structure to its very foundation. `What a confounded noise!' cried Mr. Laurens, taking his fingers out of his ears when it had ceased. `This uproar three times a day would be enough to keep me from living at a hotel. It is deafening. If a gong is to be sounded why don't they have mercy on people's nerves and ears, and sound from some distant quarter, and not directly among christian people! It is a barbarous invention!' While Mr. Laurens was giving out this philippic against gongs, Edward was conducting him in to the dining room. `Every thing is very fine here and in good taste. Table very handsomely arrayed!' said Mr. Laurens as he received his soup from the hands of Roundy, who had stationed himself behind his master's chair. As the soups were being removed Edward saw a decanter placed by a servant before the gentleman opposite to him; and instantly the thought flashed upon his mind that he must order wine for Mr. Laurens. He felt his face glow at the thought and at the recollection of his own resolution. `I must get wine for Mr. Laurens, but I need not drink any myself,' he said in his mind. Taking out his pencil he wrote on a card. `Roundy?' `Master Nedward!' `Take this card to Mr.—, at the office!' `What is it for?' stoutly asked the suspicious young countryman. `It is of no consequence to you. Take it and bring to me what he gives you.' Roundy departed and leaving the hall gave the card to Mr.—, saying, `My master wants me to hand you this. It reads. `1 Dec. Paul—pale. No, 4—I can't make out no meanin' to it, can yew?' `There is what it means,' said the gentleman smiling and handing him a decanter of Paulding's Pale Sherry. `What's that are?—wine?' `Yes, take it to Mr. Austin.' `I'm darn'd if I touch it,' answered Roundy roundly. `Then what are you doing in the dining room? Take it at once!' `Wall, I'll take it to him. Pr'aps he ony wants it for the old gentlemen, as I knows loves wine like a robin loves cherries. I take it, tho' agen my conscience an' contrary to what I knows is rite; but if enny thing happens, them as guvs it to me must take the konsekenses.' `You have been a long while gone,' said Edward angrily. `There it is, master Nedward, and I warns you!' said Roundy solemnly, as he placed the decanter emphatically upon the table. `Ah, that wine has fine colour and transparency, Edward,' said Mr. Laurens, eyeing the decanter. `It is your favorite wine, sir; allow me to fill your glass.' `You were very kind to think of me, my boy. But your own glass?' `I—that is—excuse me—I am not—' `Poh—if your head aches it will do you good. Come, come! you will not let me dine with you and drink alone.' If Mr. Laurens had formed a plan for tempting his intended son-in-law to intemperance, he could not have pursued it more directly or earnestly than he now acted. But himself, for years a moderate `table-drinker,' in safety, he did not once suspect the consequences that might follow to another. Even Edward's gradual but growing partiality for wine did not open his eyes. `I will then drink a glass with you, sir, though I made a resolution to-day I would not drink again.' `If I thought you had not sense and firmness enough to govern your appetite, I should be the last to ask you to take wine. But I have no more fear of you than I have of myself.' Edward quietly filled his own wine-glass, but while he was doing it he seemed to feel the touch of an icy finger upon his heart. He felt that he was doing a moral wrong to his conscience and degrading himself in his own eyes; for men when they deliberately break a resolution feel, in spite of themselves, humbled and experience an indescribable sensation of self-contempt. They then become judges of themselves and pass the sentence of condemnation as severely, if not far more so, upon their own act of weakness as if they had sat in judgment upon the conduct of another. The dinner progressed and Edward having once broken his resolution had no further sense of restraint beyond mere inclination and propriety.— `In for a penny, in for a pound,' is a very homely and old fashioned proverb; but it is full of meaning. The feeling it quaintly expresses Edward realised, and as he had taken one glass of wine he suffered himself, soon after to take a second, yet inwardly resolving that this days dinner should witness his last wine-drinking. Men contending with dangerous temptations to which they see they are inclined are always resolving and re-resolving, till seeing their own weakness they finally cease to resolve, and in a sort of despair, yield to the current against which they have been so impotently struggling. Towards the close of the dinner Edward recognised and bowed to an old college acquaintance he had not seen for some years. A desire to confirm the mutual recognition by sending his wine to him was irresistible, he being too far off up the table to interchange words. So he wrote on a card, `Edward Austin's compliments to his old friend, Henry Collins.' `Take my wine and this card to the gentleman in the buff vest,' said Edward to Roundy. Roundy took the decanter with a very serious countenance on which was for him a look of singular and peculiar determination, and performed the commission without making any mistake. Edward saw his friend hesitate, turn pale, then blush and fill his wine-glass. The two friends then nodded, smiled and drank of their sparkling bumpers. As the guests rose and withdrew, a place by Edward's side was left vacant, and Henry Collins seeing it left his chair and came and occupied it. He was warmly welcomed by Edward, and presented to Mr. Laurens. This gentleman at once recognised in him the son of an old friend, and after many inquiries after his father, Mr. Laurens invited him to take wine with him. `I rarely indulge, sir,' answered Henry; `but on this occasion with you and Edward, I don't know how to refuse.' Harry Collins had once been very intemperate, and at one period was nearly wrecked, soul and body, by habitual intoxication. But he had some months ago reformed. He had recovered himself and his self-respect, and was once more respected in the society in which he lived, which was in a neighboring state. He had only come to the city three days before. He had not for months touched wine or any thing the drunkard loves. He felt himself a man! He was invited to drink by his old friend and class-mate; the sight of his friend, the recognising smile, the unexpected pleasure of the recontre at table, the offer of the pleasant looking wine, the reluctance to refuse at such a moment, the inward resolution that it was only for then—conquered. But he had not yielded without a severe struggle, which as we have seen, manifested its intensity in his changing colour. He could not now refuse so respectable a looking person as Mr. Laurens. Neither could Edward decline joining in the round. They drank. Collins drank his off with a sort of wild delight. He gazed on the decanter after he had emptied his wine-glass and looked wistfully. The conversation proceeded. He did not give it his mind. He was absent and often answered at random. Scarcely could he keep his eyes off the glowing wine before him. Suddenly he grasped the decanter: `Excuse me, Austin, but you must drink with me. I have heard you are to be married. I drink to your happiness.' `He filled Edward's glass, that of Mr. Laurens and his own. But why need we proceed in detailing the steps of this painful scene. When at length Edward called for Champagne, Mr. Laurens rose to go, saying, with a smile, `Come, come, young gentlemen. You must not sit here any longer. I find you outdo an old winer like me. You have had quite enough!' `That's my 'pinion too,' echoed Roundy in a very positive tone. Edward rose and his friend also; and as the former was quite unpleasantly conscious that he had taken too many glasses of wine to present himself at once before Anne, he excused himself to Mr. Laurens on the plea of a desire to talk over `old times,' with his friend Harry. `Well, then, my dear boy, I will ride up, and we will expect you at six.' Edward saw Mr. Laurens into an omnibus, and then invited Harry to his room. Here they began a conversation touching each other's career, and both talked with great animation, for their tongues and memories were excited by wine. `Come, Ned,' at length said Harry, `this is dry work; let me as an old friend take the liberty of ordering that Champagne Mr. Laurens vetoed to to be sent up here,' as he spoke he pulled the bell which was within his reach. `A bottle of Champagne and two glasses,' said Edward to the servant.— `Stay, where is Roundy?' `I hav'nt seen him, sir.' `If you see him send him to me.' We can tell where Roundy was. After Edward and his friends had left the table, he carefully poured the little wine left in their glasses back into the decanter, and taking it underneath his arm, while he slighly pocketed a wine-glass, he took his way up stairs to the waiting-room, or servant's lodge. Here he seated himself upon a trunk, and setting down the decanter and glass upon a chair before him, thus solioquised. `It's a go with us now, no mistake. Master Nedward is in for it, and I mus'nt be left behind. I seed him drink four glasses and a half o' clear wine, and I could'nt ha' believed it if I had'nt seen it with my own two eyes. Well, who'd ha' thought this o' master Nedward, as preached so to young Mr. Waldron there in the woods coz he drinked out of a flask. I don't know which is worstest, a flask or a dekanter. Master Nedward's decanter is twice as big as Ralph's hunting flask. Oh dear me! Well, I must come to it. Here goes! It's enough to make me cry like a baby.' As he spoke, Roundy filled the wine-glass, and while big tears chased each other down his fat cheeks he drank off the wine. The taste was new to him, and the strength being something for his unaccustomed palate, he nearly strangled. `Never mind if it kills me dead I'll drink it. I must keep up with master Nedward. If he gets drunk, I gets drunk. We be as inseperable as the Siamese Twins.' There were about two glasses and a half in the decanter, and Roundy drank the last remaining drop. The wine soon began to exhibit its effects. He rose up, kicked over the chair, and began to dance, singing at the top of his voice, `Jerry Go—Nimble was lame of a leg,' when Jemmy came in. He stopped, petrified at the sight. `Och! is it you, you slapey elefant as is afther cuttin' thase didoes, and shakin' the hotil as if a cotton bale was a dancin' a jig on the ruff. What is in ye now? I niver seen the likes afore from ye!' `I'm drunk, Jemmy. I've had a jolly tipple all by myself, Hey derry, ho derry, dee!' `Drunk?' `Yes; master Nedward drinks, and so must Roundy. We are both goin' to the devil together.' `It's goin' down through the floor ye'll be, if ye kape dancin' and bouncin' about that a-way. Kape aisy a bit, and till us what's got ye.' In the meanwhile the Champagne was brought to Edward, and the two friends drank long and deep. Just as they had finished the bottle, and Edward was tipsily concluding within himself that he had drank enough if he expected to accompany Miss Laurens to the theatre that night, the door burst open and in come Roundy. Edward saw at a glance that he had been drinking. `Give us your fist, master Nedward. I'll be true—true—true to you till death. Catch me deserting you! Not as long as my name is Roundy Bee— B—Bee—Beebe!' `You have been drinking, you rascal!' `To be—to be sure I have!' `I shall send you back to the country tomorrow.' `I wish I had sent you back three weeks ago. We are gone cases now, master Nedward.' `You are too tipsy to stand; go to bed!' `I am tipsy, thou art tipsy, he is tipsy, we are tipsy, you are tipsy, they are tipsy, 'deliberately stuttered Roundy in a very tipsy tone, supporting himself by the edge of the door, and looking round as he spoke at the chairs, bed and tables, all which no doubt seemed, to his swiming head, quite as tipsy as he was himself. Edward and Harry laughed at his reply, the truth of which, ludicrous as it was, both keenly felt; and Roundy having at length reeled out, the two friends soon afterwards parted, Harry promising to see him again at the theatre.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. The moment Edward entered the drawing-room at Mr. Lauren's mansion, Miss Laurens discovered, with that quickness of perception which love gives to her sex, that he was under the influence of wine. His step was gay, his manner bold, his color heightened. She had for some days discovered with deep pain that the love of wine had taken a hold upon his heart. She had only dared a look of reproof or caution, for she felt that she had contributed her part to this dangerous temptation; nay, that but for her invitation and encouragement he might not have taken the first glass of wine! This self-condemnation was very bitter, and had caused her many unhappy hours; and she at length resolved that, if she was guilty in leading him to taste wine, she ought to use all her influence to prevail upon him to stop ere it became a confirmed habit, when she knew that all her happiness would be gone forever! But how to speak to him without offending him! She knew he was very sensitive, and the impression that she thought him so far gone in intemperance as to feel it necessary to talk with him, might perhaps, render the danger still greater. `Ah, Anne, my love!' he said approaching her with an air of gallantry, `you look divinely! charmingly! Really you will captivate my heart a second time! If Harry sees you to-night he will be sure to fall in love with you!' `Who do you mean by Harry?' `Harry? why he is my chum! Harry Collins! first rate fellow, only a little high spirited! He is—no he was—no he is in the army! He was in it and was broken for—for—for—drinking they say. But he reformed, and was restored again! Fine fellow! I must present him! Upon my soul, Anne, you do look really irresistible! Ask me a favor—any thing! that I may have the happiness of doing something to show how much I regard you! Were I Emperor of the land I would lay my empire at your feet!' As Edward thus spoke in a lively, tipsy sort of way, with a very voluble utterance, he knelt on one knee before her and laid his hand impressively upon his heart! Miss Laurens felt as if she should sink through the floor. She had never beheld him before so decidedly inebriated. Her heart was full and the whispers of self-accusation made her tremble. `Edward! rise up and do not make me wretched!' she said in a tremulons voice. `Wretched!' he repeated springing to his feet, his countenance radiant with smiles, and catching her hand and pressing it with extravagant warmth and ardor, `I make you wretched! I that would die to—' `Cease, Edward! You just now asserted that you would do any thing I asked of you!' she said in a serious voice. `Were it the half of my kingdom!' `Put an end to that light tone!' `Can I be otherwise than light in the presence of the sun of all feminine beauty?' Miss Laurens sighed, withdrew her hand from his and silently seated herself upon an ottoman nigh her, almost overcome with emotion. She saw that, although he did not stagger, although he was neatly and richly attired, that he was so much inebriated as not to be himself. His brain, not his body was intoxicated. Tears came into her eyes, and she could have shed them freely and bitterly. He stood a moment gazing upon her as if struck with surprise. He then approached her with a look as if he comprehended his own situation, and the cause of her grief. `Anne, I am very foolish. I have betrayed myself to you! I ask your forgiveness. I met Harry and we indulged a little. Pardon me, I will not offend again!' `Edward, you wished me to name the favor I would ask. It is, that you will never again drink wine! I condemn myself for asking you the first evening you were here. I have since suffered greatly for my imprudence.— Promise me, if you love me, that you will comply with my request!' He remained standing before her thoughtful, His countenance became very grave and a cloud passed across his brow. `Anne, do you really think I am in danger of becoming intemperate?' `I fear the worst, Edward!' she said earnestly. `If I thought so I should cease to respect myself. I do not think so.— I know that I have too much character and self-esteem ever to give way to intemperance. Do not fear, Anne! Your apprehensions are goundless. I don't know but that I ought to be angry with you for even suspecting such a thing of me! A gentleman may take a glass or two of wine at dinner and not be called a drunkard. Surely you do not condemn your father!' `You should have had too much delicacy to speak of him,' said Miss Laurens. `But my father is a gentleman of the old school. He has always had his wine, and never drinks except at table, and moderately. I would that he did not touch it at all. It is, however, his infirmity and I must bear with it! But as for you—' `As for me, Miss Laurens,' said Edward quickly and with a flush of displeasure, for his pride was touched at being thus arranged by her for a folly he had already condemned himself for; `I do not conceive that I am worse than Mr. Laurens. I do not see what reason you have to be so severe upon me and at the same time defend another, but for whom, I frankly confess to you, I should never have tasted wine. Your father placed the first glass in my hand, and you pledged me to drink it, when I had already refused to do it. If I am in danger of becoming an intemperate man, (which I do not think is very likely,' he added haughtily) `I have more reason to condemn than you have!' He ceased, and walked across the room with an angry tread. Miss Laurens covered her face with her hands and her bosom heaved with deep emotion. `Edward, Edward!' she cried with anguish and bitterness in her accents and flying towards him, cast herself upon her knees before him, `oh, Edward, if I have done this evil to you, I did it thoughtlessly! Forgive me, and do not overwhelm me with such reproaches. I confess my error! I implore your forgiveness!' `Anne,' he said raising her and pressing her to his bosom, `I am alone to blame. I must ask forgiveness of you. I should not have said what I just did if I had full control of myself. I solemnly swear to you that I am now cured! I will drink no more wine!' She looked up into his face with a smile of hope and encouragement chasing away the tears and clouds, when Mr. Laurens entered. `What so! Have I broken in upon a tender scene! Been quarrelling, hey! I dare say it from your looks. Well, I am glad its made up. Lovers have as many quarrels as married folks, only they are sooner over and they love one another better for it afterwards; but the married folks dont! That's the difference. Come, Anne, the carriage is at the door! We must be there in time; so let us go into the other room and take a cup of tea and toast and be off!' By the time the carriage reached the theatre, Edward was perfectly sober; though a sense of shame and a feeling of gloomy depression which he could not throw off remained; being the natural reaction of the nervous system after high artificial excitement, and which the wine drinker must endure or remove by renewed stimulants. The representation of Hamlet by the distinguished British tragedian must have fulfilled the expectations of the large and fashionable audience assembled to witness it; if a judgment can be formed from the plaudits which from time to time shook the house. Miss Laurens appreciated and enjoyed the piece with that pure pleasure which only can proceed from a well cultivated mind and refined taste. Edward, for the time overcame his gloom, and suffered the Magician of tragedy to carry him along with him where he would. In the interval between the fourth and fifth act as Edward bent down to some remark made by Anne in reference to the last scene, there was heard a sudden uproar in the lobby just outside of the box door, which was open, and his ears were assailed by voices, crying, `Turn him out!' `You are a scoundrel!' `You are a villain, sir!' With these high words were heard sounds of a struggle with blows mingled, as if one person was wrapping another over the shoulders with a cane. The gentlemen in the box rushed out and so also did Edward, who thought he recognized the tones of Harry Collins' voice in one of those that was lifted up so loud. On going into the passage he saw Harry and a gentleman grappling each other, while the latter was endeavoring, as well as he could to use his cane on the person of the former. A number of persons were trying to separate them. `You scoundrel, to insult a lady under my protection!' and up and down again went the cane: but this time it was caught by Edward. `Sir, this gentleman is my friend, what has he done?' `Done! The drunken dog! I was coming out of my box with a lady, when telling me that she had forgotten her fan, I imprudently quit her, leaving her standing in the lobby when this fellow, with the outside of a gentleman and wearing the button of a profession that should every where stamp its wearer as a gentleman and man of honor, has the audacity to throw his arm around her waist and ask her to take wine with him in the saloon! The infernal—' `He is intoxicated, sir,' said Edward again arresting a blow. `You would not beat a man who cannot defend himself!' `He deserves to be kicked into the street, and you too, sir, if you take his part!' `I do sir?' demanded Edward in a determined tone. `Yes, you do, sir, if you defend a blackguard!' `The gentleman is no doubt to blame, but was probably under the influence of wine when he insulted the lady,' answered Edward with forced calmness. Commit him to me, and I will answer for it, that to-morrow he will make every apology that is required! As for you, sir,' he said in a low, deep voice, `I shall expect you to apologize to me!' D—me if I dont, Ned,' hiccupped Harry as the enraged gentleman released his collar. `I say, Ned, you are a goo—good—good fellow, you are! a t-t-tr-true friend!' `You may thank me, I do not give you up to the police!' said the gentleman very pale. 4 `I do thank you upon my s-s-sou-soul. I do p-p-p-'pon honor!' answered Collins tipsily for himself. `The fact is you are a coward to strike— (hiccup) a man with (hiccup) a cane! I'll have the satisfaction of a gentleman, (hiccup)!' `Come, Harry, let us go,' said Edward again sternly meeting the eye of the man who had insulted him; and taking Collins by the arm he led him into the vestibule and thence out towards the street. He now found his friend was quite too much inebriated to walk steady. `Where have you been to get so drunk?' he asked angrily. `Drunk! Why I have been drinking, don't you know! I drank with you, you know my boy! and then it was all down-hill after the first glass. I got tipsy jist as easy! I have'nt tasted wine for ten months before to day!' Edward felt as if he had received a heavy blow upon the breast. He now saw the evil effects of his own indulgence in his friend. The consciousness that he had been instrumental in placing him in this condition in which he saw him, cut him to the heart. He resolved that he would not leave him to do any more mischief, but accompany him home in a carriage and then return to the play. `Remain here one moment, Harry, while I excuse my absence to Miss Laurens. Don't stir from the spot till I return to you!' Harry would have found it difficult to have done so, as he had drank a great deal in the theatre and was now thoroughly drunk. He had drank after he had parted from Edward at his rooms, partly from despair and madness at having been betrayed into drinking again, and partly to gratify the resistless desire to drink deeper and deeper of the maddening cup which he had so long kept from his lips, and which once more tasted made him totally reckless of consequences. While he stood there holding himself up by the door near the outer entrance of the theatre three or four young men came forth, and as they passed him one of them exclaimed, `That is the fellow, now, Graham!' `The young man turned round with a fiery air and fixing his flashing eyes upon him advanced and said, `So you are the villain that insulted my sister! Take that and that! I have been looking for you! Take that!' And while speaking he pulled him by the nose and kicked him and hurled him out of the door to the sidewalk with a force that cast him upon his back on which he fell with violence. `You have hurt him!' cried the friends of the incensed brother. `I care not if I have killed him!' The fall and shock instead of stunning Harry sobered him so far as to cause him to rise to his feet and attack his antagonist with drunken fury. The conflict gathered a crowd, and the police officer appearing took Collins into custody and two of them led him off between them notwithstanding his desperate struggles to free himself. When Edward a moment after reappeared and not finding his friend, learned from the bystanders the circumstances, his first impulse was to follow and attempt to get him released; for he keenly felt how much he had been to blame in the affair. While he was hesitating, a heavy hand slapped him familiarly upon the shoulder and a voice he well knew, and started to hear addressed him: `Ah, Austin, how are you? You dont know me, hey?' said a young man who looked very dissipated: His dress was ill put on; his neck-cloth awry, and his eyes inflamed by drink. `Is it you, Waldron?' `You are as cold as salad! It is me. Come, Ned, let us have a glass of wine together for old times!' `You are intoxicated now! I dont wish any thing to say to you! Excuse me, I have engaged with a party in the theatre!' answered Edward distantly. `Oh, very well. You can keep sober and I cant,' said Ralph in a tone of self-reproach and conscious degradation! `The truth is, Ned, that Hunting Flask has been the ruin of me, and drink will be the death of me yet! I wish I had taken your advice! Yes, I am tipsy, but I know what I am saying! I wish I had taken your advice. I have got into a bad way; for, getting into the habit of drinking, I am now drunk all the time!' `If you are conscious of this failing why don't you stop?' said Edward surprised to hear him say so. `I must drink! I dare not not be sober a minute! Do you know I have lost every dollar of my money gambling! This it is makes me drink. I keep the Hunting Flask full of brandy in my room and if I wake up at night and find from my thoughts troubling me, I am getting sobered, then I drink till I drown 'em! It is a horrid life, Ned! I wish I had followed your advice. I have now only a four shillings left. I am going to-night to venture that, in a rum-hole, and if I lose it, as I dare say I shall, I shall then become a gutter drunkard! I gamble in two-cent-a-glass cellars now! I used to be good enough for Frankton's when I had my dollars! I have got down to the two cent cut now! I am a poor devil, Ned!' `You amaze me. I pity you, Ralph!' `I don't want pity! You are a temperate man! keep so! never drink any thing! The first glass may lead to hundreds! You are a respectable man! I am a poor devil! Good night. Our careers lie different ways! When you hear that I am dead, let me have one tear, Ned!' `It is not too late to save yourself! You have such full consciousness of your situation you can easily recover yourself!' `No, Ned! I know I am going to hell. But I can't stop myself! There is a fatality I must yield to! I have no control over my own will. I see the right and do the wrong. A man who drinks gives the reins up to his passion for drink, and the whip to the devil, and then his story is told! Good night, Ned!' Thus speaking Ralph Waldron disappeared among the crowd, leaving Edward overcome with pity for him, and overwhelmed with alarm for himself! Ralph was now just at the close of that career through which we have already followed him in chapter Fifth, when he left Frankton's gambling halls penniless, and self-castaway. Edward returned to the box where he left Anne, but the remainder of the play he was silent; for his conscience and heart were both heavy. His gloom was observed by Miss Laurens, and she resorted to every alluring grace of conversation to draw him out of this mood, without success. He scarcely listened to her—seemed hardly conscious that he was in her presence. At length the piece ended, and they left the theatre, Anne leaning on Edward's arm. As they were about to enter the carriage Edward saw coming out of the theatre the gentleman whom Harry had had the contest with, and who had so grossly insulted himself. Instantly he was recalled to what he conceived a duty due to his own honor, and which he had forgotten, in reflecting upon poor Harry's fate. Not far from this person he also saw a gentleman whom he had met several times at the hotel and whom he knew to belong to one of the first families in town, though with rather a flawry reputation. Still he was a `gentleman' and as such Edward had met him in society. `The very man I want;' he said half aloud. `Excuse me an instant Miss Anne,' he added as he handed her into the carriage and saw her followed by her father. He then crossed the walk to this person who was leaning familiarly on the arm of De Witt Wittlesey, whom, however, Edward did not at first recognize. `Mr. Levis, I wish to see you on some private business. Will you be so kind as to call in at the Astor and await my return from Bleeker street. I have to see a lady home, and will return at once!' `Bay all means, moy daar fallow,' answered Fred Levis; `but oi was just walking over to P—'s with Witt here, as ye spoke! youa know Witt!' Wittlesey extended his hand eagerly to shake that of Edward with great warmth; for they had already before met and been introduced to each other. Edward did not like him, for he knew his character, and that he was a friend of Waldron's. Therefore he said to Levis in a peculiar tone; `you will be quite alone and disengaged, Mr. Levis, if not I will find some other friend! `Oh, quite alone! another friend, eh? what is it an affair? I did hear of a row and some high words in the lobby, I wonder if—' Edward placed his finger upon his lip and Levis stopped. `You will be there!' `Say P—'s, as we were going there! I will await ye there!' `Well, at P—'s in half an hour, answered Edward. The next moment he was seated by the side of Miss Laurens in the carriage, and entertained her in the liveliest manner as they rode; so that from his excess of spirits, which he assumed to disguise his gloom of soul, she began to fear he had taken wine. But Edward had not taken any wine since he had left his hotel. The intoxicating influence of that had passed off before he reached the theatre, but not so the effect. It left his mind as we have seen in a dull, heavy humor, depressed and sullen. Cheerfulness was banished, and dark feelings reigned in his thoughts. He was irritable and sad at heart, and precisely in that crisis of temper which is most dangerous to its possessor. The least spark would kindle in the smouldering furnace of his moody feelings, quicker than when his brain had been more directly excited by the intoxicating ether of the wine he had drunk. It was, therefore, that he took offence so quickly and resented so determinedly the angry words of an incensed man; which, at any other time he would, with the forbearance and dignified moderation characteristic of his noble nature, have passed by forgiven and forgotten. The inebriate is ever the most quarrelsome in the hours of depression and gloom that follow the false spirits, which he has borrowed from the wine-cup. Edward, therefore, though not under the immediate intoxicating influence of wine when he so rashly and unadvisedly committed himself to the gentleman who had such good cause to be enraged with Collins, and any who called themselves his friends, was yet governed by its effects and in bondage to its power! These reflections passed through his own mind as he rode back alone, with leisure to think; and the evil-doer always thinks rightly and judges correctly upon his own acts and the causes which led to them. `This all comes of that hateful wine-drinking,' he exclaimed bitterly as the coach drew up before P—'s brilliantly lighted saloon. `Oh Anne, Anne if you knew into what peril and guilt I have been driven, you would weep, weep, that you ever encouraged me to take that first glass of wine! Step by step, with gradual but fearfully rapid progression, I have become a confirmed wine drinker! and my, God! what has not my example done to others! I have ruined poor Harry! I have been his tempter, well knowing his failure and that—Oh, God! I cannot dwell upon this! and if I think about myself I shall go mad!' He alighted from the coach and crossing the walk hurriedly entered the dazzling hall, fearing to attract the notice of any grave citizen. He had never before entered this luxurious scene of fashionable dissipation. He stood an instant after entering, to survey the scene of Magnificence. It was a vast apartment, panelled with mirrors, the walls adorned with rich and voluptuous paintings, the ceiling exquisitely painted in fresco and colors, and wherever his eye fell, it was agreeably surprised with the most tasteful creatures of art, or dazzled with scenes of inconceivable splendor. From a distant orchestra swelled the ravishing voices of beautiful singing girls, mingled with the sounds of the harp and viol. The floor of the saloon was thronged with guests, some walking up and down smoking cigars, others standing in groups conversing with animation, others listening to the singing, and commenting upon the richness of their voices, and the beauty of their persons. Along the wall of glittering mirrors were ranged lines of white marble tables, at which others were seated partaking of refreshments, reading the news, or idly smoking and listening to the fair choristers. At the extremity were seen open distant doors leading into apartments exhibiting scarcely less luxury. One of them Edward saw was a billard room! While he was making these observations, Levis, who had seen him, came forward and took his hand. `Ah, moy dare faller! Ye are as punctual as Time! Now Oi am at yer serviss moi dare faller!' and as the fashionable young man spoke he twirled his gold eye-glass, levelled it from his eye at the singers and added, `foin gearls. Austin! Foin voices, charmant! Ever been in here before?' `Never.' `Thought so, by your staring round! Shall be happy to show yer 'bout.!' `I have first a favor to ask of you,' said Edward, who did not feel altogether at home in such a crowd. `Command me, Austin! I am at yer serviss!' `Can we be retired here a few moments?' `Oh yes, come with me,' answered Levis placing his arm in his, and walking up the thronged hall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. Edward suffered himself to be conducted the whole length of the gorgeous saloon, and passed with him into the billiard-room. This was an elegant hall, and the tables and furniture were of the richest description.— Several young gentlemen in blue or scarlet smoking caps, and round linen jackets were at play, while at each table was stationed a beautiful young girl as marker. Like the outer saloon there was an eye in the whole arrangement to the allurement of the young and gay: and youths innumerable here first caught the mortal infection of vice, concealed under a gilded surface. There was many a fair youth but a few weeks from a hallowed home, and for whom, perhaps, at the very moment that Edward was gazing round upon them with surprise at their number and youthfulness, the prayer of a mother or sister were then ascending, that God would protect them from the snares of the metropolis, and guard their hearts pure from the vices that would tempt them from integrity and virtue. `This is a sad scene,' thought Edward, as he crossed this apartment and entered a small and elegant withdrawing room, richly carpeted and curtained, and lined with velvet ottomans. It was softly lighted by solar lamps. `Here we are alone,' said Levis, glancing round the room. `We are fortunate in finding it empty. This is on purpose for private conversations.— Now we are seated by this marble table, I am ready to hear you and to serve you,' said Levis in a tone less affected than he had hitherto used. `What I desire of you is this, my dear sir,' said Edward, and he then proceeded to inform him of the scenes that had taken place in the lobby. When he had ended Levis was thoughtful a moment. `You say this person's name is Frazier?' `So I was told by a by-stander of whom I enquired.' `You did not give him your card, nor take his?' `No; I merely said I should demand an apology for his language.' `Certainly, my dear Austin. You could not let such a thing pass. You did right. Frazier? had he gray eyes, and an imperial, with a fair complexion, and tall, with great breadth across the shoulders?' `Yes!' `It is Douglas Frazier! He is addressing a Miss —, whom I saw enter the theatre with him, and it was she, doubtless, whom your friend Harry Collins was so unfortunate as to insult so grossly. Douglas Frazier—for I see you are about to ask me who he is—is a man of good property, left him by his mother. He has been abroad, returned with a mustache and European (that is a medley of French, English, German and Italian, with a touch of the Russian manners and habits,) and now sets up for a fine man about town. He has the reputation of having fought a duel in Austria with an Englishman, but this is questionable. But he presumes much upon it, and mainly depends upon this capital for his reputation.' `You must take a note from me in the morning, Levis,' said Edward very positively. I am willing now to overlook what he said to me, and if I thought he would not expect to hear from me, I would let it drop, for I was quicker than was advisable.' `He will of course expect to hear from you. If you let it pass without doing any thing after having so positively committed yourself, he would proclaim every where that you were a coward. `It is too late, I see, to withdraw. I will write a note which you shall deliver to him. It is, mark you, Levis, by no means my purpose to call him out. A duel is farthest from my thoughts There is no doubt, when he reads my note, that he will render me a full apology.' `Perhaps,' answered Levis dryly and doubtfully; and by no means desirous that he should apologise; for like all idle men of his class he was in his element with an affair of this kind, in fact, for the employment of his passions and time; besides there is a sort of eclat attached to such matters, greatly coveted by such persons. There was on a side-table the most elegant arrangements made for writing. Letter paper, gilded note paper, ivory handled pens, silver ink-stands, particolored and fancy wafers, tasteful seals, were all at hand. While Edward was writing, Levis deliberately pulled the bell. It was answered by a young girl. `Champagne, my dear,' he said in a tone so as not to disturb his friend. When Edward completed his note, he looked up to read it, and seeing with surprise a bottle of Champagne and glasses standing on a silver waiter before Levis, he turned pale and trembled; for he had, while in the carriage alone, on his way there, been thinking of wine to drive away his gloom, but without the resolution either to banish the idea, or to indulge the temptation. He now felt such a strong desire for it, on seeing it, (for he knew it would deaden his sensibilities, which were to acute for his peace of mind,) that he knew he should drink with Levis if invited; and therefore he had shuddered: for `to will was present with him; but how to perform that which is good he found not. The good that he would, he did not; but the evil which he would not, that he did.' There was `a law in his members warring against the law of his mind and bringing him into captivity' to the law of death, and making him a bond servant to intemperance. He felt this most bitterly, and felt like crying out with the Apostle though from a different cause, `O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?' `Here is my note,' he said in a husky tone. `See if it will do.' And he thus read: `Sir,—Last night you made use of language to me, which, as a gentleman I cannot pass by. An apology is due to me; and I trust that you will not hesitate to render one in the most unqualified manner to my friend Mr. Frederick Levis, who will be the bearer of this note to you. I have the honor to be, Sir. Your Obedient Servant. Edward Austin. P—'s, 11 1-2 P. M. `It is the very thing, Austin,' answered Levis with delight. `You understand the phraseology duello, I see in superb style! I will take it to him in the morning, while he is at breakfast. He boards at the Carlton. Now my boy, let us take a glass of Champaigne—Napoleon brand. You look fagged, and this will put life into you.' `As he spoke, he cut the wire, the cork flew with a report, and the foaming wine sparkled in both of the tall glasses. `Here's to your success with Frazier.' Edward took up the glass and drank it off in and with a sort of desperate air. He had hardly set the glass down empty, when the door opened gently and De Witt Wittlesey came half in, half retreated, and still held the door without departing, but lingering as if expecting to be invited to come in. `Ah, De Witt, come in! we are through our little matters, said Levis. `Perhaps I intrude' he said entering and shutting the door with great confidence. `No, come in and take a glass of wine.' Before midnight, the three had drank six bottles of wine, and Edward had to be escorted home between the two, who were only steadier than himself because they had more seasoned heads. When they reached the hotel they found themselves, however, too drunk to get to their own lodging and each of them having to be assisted up stairs by a pair of servants. When Edward awoke the next morning, he found himself lying upon his bed fully dressed with his boots, and even his hat on, which was jammed tightly over his eyes. It took him some minutes to recollect himself, and throw off a crowd of dreadful ideas that filled his mind. At length he sat up in bed, and began to think. The event of the night rushed vividly upon after another upon his consciousness. till unable to endure the horrors of his feelings, he leaped from the bed and violently rung the bell. `Bring me some brandy!' he demanded in a stern and sullen tone as the servant entered. It was brought to him on a waiter with water, sugar and lemon. He had never drank brandy. But he had an instinctive feeling that it would quicker hush his conscience than wine, for which he suddenly felt a loathing. He prepared his draught and drank it off without suffering himself to think upon what he was doing. `Where is Roundy?' he fiercely interrogated the servant. `He is in his room, sir.' `What does he do there, the lazy fellow. Send him to me.' `His leg, sir.' His leg! What do you stand the gaping for? What do you mean by his leg?' `We told you when you came home last night, sir.' `Told me? I—I—recollect being told nothing.' `You know, sir, he broke his leg.' `Broke his leg? Roundy?' asked Edward in amazement. `Yes, Sir. You see he got somehow to drinking after dinner, and got tipsy, sir; and as he war'nt used to it, it turned his brain, and so he went to dancing on the sky light, sir, and fell thro', as of course he would, to the next floor, and broke his leg!' `And you say he is in bed? Has a surgeon been with him?' `Oh, yes, Sir. Every thing was done for him, and I heerd one o' the women say as how he was easier this mornin' sir.' Edward buried his face in his hands, groaned heavily with anguish of soul, and sunk down by his bedside with his face in his pillow. `Poor Roundy! Poor, poor Roundy! This is my act! I have done this! I! Oh, God where will the consequences of my folly end!' He lay sometime giving himself up to despair and self-accusation; at length he rose up and went to see the simple victim of his example.— When the poor youth saw him enter, his eyes brightened, and he suppressed a groan of suffering. `I am glad to see you, Master Nedward,' he said affectionately. `Poor Roundy! This is a sad accident!' `If I live 'twill cure me, Master Nedward!' `Cure you?' `Yes, Master Nedward! I was takin' to drinkin' and I dont know what would ha' been the end and upshot if I had'nt broke my leg. But its a lesson. I'd rather broked my leg than been a drunken dog! Its cured me Master Nedward. I only tried it once, and here I am for it!' here Roundy groaned with pain. `You suffer a great deal! `Not so much as I did, Master Nedward, when the doctor and four men sot my leg. But I dont suffer on my own account. It is'nt my bones as I suffers most in; its thinkin.' `Thinking?' `Yes. I thinks about you, Master Nedward, and this troubles me. I see you are getting to love wine, Master Nedward, and it makes me so sorry that I don't think any thing o' my pains a thinking on it! Do, Master Nedward, stop right off short, and never take another glass o' wine so long as you live, and your mother lives! Think of her and how wretched she'd be if she knew—' `There, there, good Roundy, that will do,' interrupted Edward, who could not recal the idea of his mother, without anguish, and who felt every word of the poor serving-man sink into and pierce his heart. `I will do as you say, Roundy.' `Wont you drink no more, Master Nedward? `No, Roundy, I will not.' `Good, kind master! Oh, I am so happy!' cried the grateful Roundy; and catching Edward's hand to his lips he covered it with kisses and bathed it with tears of joy. Edward was deeply moved. He remained an hour with his servant, till the surgeon came, of whom he anxiously inquired about his situation. He was told that it was a compound fracture, and that it would be many weeks before he would be able to go out; the surgeon also told him that his exceeding fleshy condition would render a fever fatal, and that he must be kept perfectly quiet, as he was threatened with one, from the heated state of his blood, caused by the wine, porter and even rum, he was informed he had been drinking, just before the accident. It can be easily imagined with what emotions Edward heard this last statement made. After the surgeon left, and while he was making and strengthening new resolutions in his mind, a servant came in for him. On going to his room he found Mr. Levis awaiting him. `Well, my dear fellow! But—how haggard you look! You don't stand late hours and champaigne like me! I was up with the lark—drank a bottle of pure soda-water, poured another over my head and chest, sent to the bar for a bittered brandy sling strong, and in half an hour I was as good as new! Hearing you were in bed, I thought I would'nt disturb you, so breakfasted with De Witt, who is almost as heavy as you are, and started off to find my man!' `And found him?' Yes, in a dressing room, taking his coffee. I was shown into his room having first sent up my card with `on particular and pressing business,' written on it in pencil. I entered and as we had already met several times we shook hands; but formally declining the chair he desired me to occupy, I handed him your note. He read it, and bless me if he moved a muscle of his face. When he had done, he folded it up, and in the most quiet way imaginable, and smiling gently as he regarded me, said, confoundedly polite. `Be so civil, Mr. Levis, as to return to Mr. Edward Austin, as I believe he signs himself, (and here he put up his eye-glass to take a cool second look at your signature) and say to that personage that I have no apology to make to him, and that I think, really, that he is inconceivably impertinent in presuming to ask me for one!' Edward's brow looked as dark as the storm-cloud when charged with the thunder bolt. He sprang to his feet and stood like a statue of fierce and fiery anger. He had hoped secretly that the apology would be tendered.— He believed that it would be; and he had not let the result give him the least uneasiness or concern. Surprise and disappointment now sharpened and gave sting to his quick resentment at this insulting reply. `Mr. Levis, that man I must meet.' `I see no alternative, sir,' answered Levis, his eyes sparkling with secret satisfaction. I will write! will you bear my note?' `With pleasure.' `In a few moments Edward read what he had written. `Sir: My friend, Mr. Levis, is authorized to arrange on my behalf, with any friend you may name, the preliminaries usual in settling affairs between gentlemen holding, in relation to each other, the position we now do. Very Respectfully, Edward Austin. After Mr. Levis had departed on his hostile mission, Edward paced the floor with feelings of the most painful nature. He had created for himself a world of misery and despair that seemed to close around him darker and narrower, and from which there seemed no way of escape. `So I am involved in a duel,' he said savagely, yet with poignant grief pressing the hot tears from his eyes. `Well, I must abide it; Oh, Thought and Conscience! Ye are fiery foes to the evil doer! I would I could annihilate both! I can render them insensible; Brandy will do it; no, no! NO!! I will not fly to that! I have promised Roundy; Poor Roundy! How he kissed my hand, when I richly merited his curses! But I cant endure these reflections; I cant think of him—no—nor of myself.' `Did you ring, sir?' `Ring? no;' yet he had rung the bell, and violently, in his walk up and down his chamber; but he did it unconscious of the act, and without intent. `But stay; what is that you have in your hand?' `The Morning Paper.' `Leave it with me, and bring me a glass of water. And then I want you to go to the counting room of Mordent, Godine &amp; Co. and tell them I am indisposed, and shall not be there to-day.—Now let me divert my mind from itself,' he said throwing himself into a chair. `Politics'—pah! `Dreadful Accident!' `Conflagration!' Police Reports! Hah, what is this? Lieut. Henry Collins! His name here! what can this mean!' He read with horror, as follows: `Painful Event.—We regret to record the death by suicide of Lieut. Henry Collins in the Police lock-up, where he was found dead this morning hanging by the neck to one of the bars of the inside lattice door, having hung himself with one of his suspenders. He was, we learn, taken there for having, in a state of intoxication, insulted a lady at the theatre. Being a young gentleman of a high sense of honor, though in this unfortunate condition for the time, it is supposed that on realizing his degrading situation this morning, he yielded to his morbid sensitiveness, and fearing again to meet the eyes of the world whose courtesies he had outraged, he fled to suicide! `What renders this event peculiarly painful, is the fact, whtch we have just now learned, that this young gentleman was at one time addicted to such intemperate habits, as to render it expedient that he should leave the army; but that he afterwards became so thoroughly reformed that for some months he has been in the service again; and up to yesterday he has not been known to indulge even in a glass of wine. What unhappy and sudden temptation has been instrumental in leading him to the sad fall, and melancholy end, it is not in our power to explain. The Coroner gave in his verdict in accordance with the above facts.' Edward sat several minutes with the open newspaper before him, and with his gaze fixed on the paragraph, transfixed and motionless as a statue; Gradually an expression of horror grew upon his features; his complexion, flushed while he read, became the hue of ashes, his eyes glared wildly; suddenly a sharp, wild cry like the rending of a human soul, escaped his lips, and he sprang to his feet with an air of desperate frenzy. He tottered, recovered himself, pressed his hands to his temples and stood for at least ten minutes in that attitude without motion. Who can tell what thoughts, what torture of thought occupied his mind in this interval? At length he dropped his hands and clasping his fingers with nervous horror, he exclaimed, bitterly, bitterly, most bitterly. `My cup is full! It is poured in to the brim! I am not only a drunkard, but a murderer! I have murdered my friend! Despair! Madness! I am your victim!' He rushed across the chamber with outstretched arms and glaring eye-balls, as if he would have embraced the dreadful images he invoked, when a knock was given upon the door. With an effort that seemed almost superhuman, he all at once controlled his feelings, and he said with a forced, but extraordinary calmness, `Come in!' Levis entered. Edward smiled thourgh the ghastliness of his visage and said, in the same forced tone of composure, but with a depth that made his friend start! `Well?' `You look ill!' `It is nothing! What said the gentleman?' he demanded so sternly that Levis stepped back a pace and gazed on him with surprise. He read your missive with the most consummate coolness, and then referred me to a friend! It was, who do you think, but Wittlesey! I saw him and we have arranged every thing for our respective principals. You are to meet at sunset this evening at Hoboken. Weapons pistols, and if these fail, small swords. This is Frazier's choice, and he seems confoundedly savage. `I am satisfied,' responded Edward in a perfectly unmoved voice. `Then there is nothing to do but get ready. Have you weapons?' `I don't own neither pistol or sword.' `That is nothing. You can purchase them at —'s in Broadway.— Suppose we walk that way.' `No, I shall not go out. I leave it to you. Purchase for me the weapons required. There is a hundred dollar note! If they come to more, I will pay it. Arrange every thing yourself. I wish to have no trouble.' `Bein, my dear fellow! You shall not complain; I will have you ready by noon. You will want to cross over a couple of hours before sunset to practice a bit; or suppose you go and pass the afternoon in the pistol gallery!' `No. I shall not practice; I shall not practice!' answered Edward in a tone of gloomy determination. `Are you so good a shot then? a swordsman too?' that is capital! I should be glad to see you put a point or a bullet, under that confoundedly cool fellow's doublet. By the by, what surgeon will you have?' Edward, at first, made no reply. He seemed, all the while, to be wishing his second would terminate his visit. Levis had to repeat the question. `It is of no consequence. I will have none!' `Very well; That shows a confidence in yourself—I like. But it would be safer.' `Safer!' repeated Edward in a tone of contempt; `safer! who seeks safety.—Not I.' `I did not mean you were a coward, my boy.' `Coward! Oh, no! I am no coward; Oh no, I have no fears, sir;' and looking his friend in the face he laughed so strangely that Levis turned pale. `You are devilishly odd, Austin; One don't know what to make of you.' `No, I dare say; call here at 5 o'clock and I will be at your service,' he said in a commanding tone.' `Wont you dine with me?' `No!' Levis started, looked as if he would like to take offence at the quick, stern negative given him, and then bidding him good morning, he slowly left the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">`Sir,—Last night you made use of language to me, which, as a gentleman I cannot pass by. An apology is due to me; and I trust that you will not hesitate to render one in the most unqualified manner to my friend Mr. Frederick Levis, who will be the bearer of this note to you. I have the honor to be, Sir. Your Obedient Servant. Edward Austin. P—'s, 11 1-2 P. M.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">`Sir: My friend, Mr. Levis, is authorized to arrange on my behalf, with any friend you may name, the preliminaries usual in settling affairs between gentlemen holding, in relation to each other, the position we now do. Very Respectfully, Edward Austin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. The golden sun of an autumn evening was just withdrawing his level beams of light from amid the woodlands of Hoboken, leaving behind, the softly gathering shadows of twilight, when a boat, rowed by a single oarsman, and containing two gentleman, landed at the base of a rock, under the covert of a vast oak. They were Edward Austin and Frederick Levis.— The former, wrapped in a cloak, walked silently along the shore towards a level area by the water-side, in which stood a monument erected to one who had fallen on the spot where it stood, a victim to the laws of honor, falsely so called. A lingering sun-beam still lighted up the summit, but disappeared a moment after Edward's eye had rested upon it. He sighed, for he believed and hoped that it was the last sunlight he should ever behold. Levis followed him with a case beneath his arm, and a small sword carefully wrapped up and disguised in paper. `It was a curious whim of Frazier to choose sunset!' he said, `But I suppose it is that escape may be more easily effected, with a night before one, in case the affair should draw blood. Ah! they are there! I thought the four oared boat that landed a quarter of a mile above us, must have been their party. There is with Frazier, Wittlesey and Dr McDonald!' As he spoke, the three persons named appeared in a path leading from a group of trees, and took up a position a few paces from the monument. Levis, placing his case of pistols on the ground, opened it, and laid them out; he also unrapped the shining sword and tried its elastic temper by a few thrusts in the air. De Wittlesey then came forward, and Levis met him, they bowed formally and proceeded to preliminaries. Wittlesey tossed a dollar into the air, and to Levis fell the choice of positions. He looked around and resolved to place his principal with the rocks and trees for a back ground, so that Frazier would have to stand with the bright river which reflected the glowing sky behind him, bringing his person into full relief. Ten paces were then paced off by Levis, and the places where each was to stand indicated by a little stick stuck in the green sward. These matters being arranged, which Edward stood alone observing, with folded arms and an air of gloomy abstraction, the two seconds proceeded to load the pistols under each others supervision. This done they measured the swords against each other by laying them side by side, and having ascertained that they were of equal length they declared that they were ready for their principals to take their places. Levis placed a pistol in Edward's hand. He took it mechanically. `Throw off your cloak, my dear Austin! You seem to forget!' `Oh, ah! true!' he said with a smile of derision, and a look of ghastly despair. `Pray be cool and calm,' said Levis who began to think Austin might be a coward. `Cool? Look at me in the eyes! are they shrinking think you! Behold my hand as I thus level my arm, does it shake? Does my voice tremble? Oh, no!' he laughed hollowly; I wish it did! Frazier shook hands gaily with his surgeon, took his position, received his cocked weapon from his second's hand, and examined the lock with the most perfect coolness. The surgeon retired a little from the line of fire, and De Wittlesey stood near by him. Levis shook hands with Edward, but shrunk from the look of anguish and woe he fixed upon him as he said in a deep, but tremulous voice, `Farewell! good night! Forever good night! night, night, NIGHT, forever night!' `Are you ready?' cried Wittlesey, to whom it had fallen to give the word. `Ready,' responded Frazier firmly. `Ready,' echoed Edward mechanically. `Fire! one, two, three!' Frazier raised his pistol at the word `fire,' levelled it, and lingered till the word `three' (between which words they must fire, or not at all,) hoping to draw his antagonists fire first; but seeing Edward did not raise his weapon, and supposing him waiting for the same, he fired at the word `three.' At the instant, he drew the trigger, Edward raised his weapon and discharged it towards the river, when the ball from Frazier's pistol striking the upraised weapon in his hands shattered the stock, and hurled it from his grasp. `Folly, Austin,' cried Levis with surprise and indignation. `Why were you so insane as to throw away your shot?' `I do not wish to do murder in cold blood! Oh, no! I have done murder enough!' he answered hoarsely. `If I should kill him, even brandy would not make me forget! It will not make me forget, Harry, poor Harry! I can't live and think! And Roundy too!' `For Heaven's sake, Austin, what is the matter!' `Nothing, nothing! where are the swords? Be ready with them. Do you not see 'tis growing night! Darkness comes to witness our doings! The swords, I say!' Levis handed him his sword with a look of surprise. He could not account for conduct, the secret of which was hid from his knowledge in the depths of the broken and wrecked bosom before him. He knew that it was not cowardice, for from first to last, Edward had not shown fear. `He is a strange fellow! One would think he came here to be shot! He seems a misanthrope who is weary of life, and would make Frazier his executioner! Gentlemen are you ready?' The two combatants advanced and crossed blades with a clash. Edward was a good small-swordsman, having had a great deal of practice with foils in college. Frazier in his attitude and parries showed himself a master of the weapon. He was remarkably cool. Edward was no less composed, but it was a stern and terrible composure. They exchanged a few passes, and then each retreated a pace. As they did so, Edward beckoned to Levis. `Sir, if I fall, you will find a package of letters in my desk, at my room. Deliver them as addressed.' He again assumed his position, and their swords rung and struck fire. `I must needs make seeming effort, or he will not press me, and give me the death I covet,' he said within himself; and then so closely did he engage and urge his antagonist that for a few moments Levis was sure that Frazier would fall. All at once a quick, loud cry of exultation escaped from Frazier; Edward's sword flew from his hand and he reeled and fell his whole length upon the sward. Levis was at his side in an instant, and supporting his head upon his knee. The surgeon also hastened to his succor. Frazier stood by, with a flushed cheek, sparkling eyes, and compressed lips, very deliberately wiping the ensanguined point of his sword, by thrusting it into the earth. `The steel has penetrated his heart! He is dead already,' said the surgeon in tones of surprise and pity. Dead, say you!' demanded the murderer, changing color. `Dead Sir.' `Fly, Frazier!' exclaimed Wittlesey. `This is no place for us.' Levis seeing that his principal was dead, let his head lay upon the ground, and rose to his feet. `He is gone, Doctor!' he said, shaking his head. `Gone!' answered the surgeon, in a tone of compassion. A noble young man. I knew him slightly. Not a more promising person in town! 'Tis a pity!' `He was engaged and soon to be married too, to the rich Miss Laurens,' said Levis. `It is a confounded unfortunate affair. But he had something on his mind, that led me to believe he wished to fall! And, poor fellow, there he lies! `Doctor,' said De Wittlesey, we are going to cross the river. Will you accompany us? We have no time. We intend to take the early five o'clock boat for Boston, till the affair is blown over.' `Yes. I can do nothing here! I will go.' `For God's sake gentleman, don't leave me here with the corpse,' cried Levis. `There is no alternative! You have a boat and oarsmen. They must do for you. We can't wait,' answered Wittlesey whose voice, looks and manner betrayed alarm and a selfish desire of personal security. The three hastened to the boat and soon put off and were lost in the darkness that was rapidly falling over land and wate. Levis hurried away from the fatal spot, leaving the body of the unfortunate Edward stretched out along and cold upon the ground. In a few moments Levis returned with the two men and they bore the body to the boat and put off from the shore, leaving the scene of such deeds of violence as had just been enacted there, reposing quiet and still beneath the stars and deep blue sky. The darkness covered the blood upon the green sward, and hid the passiontrampled ground. But the cry of blood went up from the steeped earth to the ear of the Invisible, and the recording angel wrote down another murder upon the page of the record of human crimes! It was a melancholy half hour for Levis while the boat was reaching the city from the duelling ground; for with all that levity and selfishness of character which belongs to men of his class, he could not but deeply lament the untimely end of his friend; and especially as he believed he had thrown his own life away, rather than fallen in a fairly contested and equal field. Landing at the foot of Hammersley street, he despatched one of the men for a coach, and placed the body in it. He resolved to drive directly to the house of Mr. Laurens, instead of to the hotel, which would be too public for himself; as it was necessary for his own safety that he should not be known to have been concerned in this fatal affair. He had secured the services of the boatmen by large bribes, and the coachman's secrecy and services had also to be secured by the same means. Having placed the body in the coach, he paid them and gave them orders to drive with it to No — Carrol Place. `When you get there, one of you go and ring the bell, ask for Mr. Laurens, and give him this card. He will take care of the body!' Levis had written upon a card with pencil, as well as he could, under a lamp-post that stood not far from the lauding as follows: `Sir,—These men bring you the body of Mr. Edward Austin who fell this evening, just after sunset, in a duel with small swords at Hoboken. (Signed) His Second. `P. S. The delicacy of my position in reference to this important occurrence, must excuse me both from appearing before you and giving my name. A package which Mr. Austin left directed to you, will be sent to your house in the morning.' Anne Laurens was in the drawing-room reading aloud from the evening paper to her father. She was nervous and anxious; for she had not seen Edward that day, when it was his duty, even if he had not been in the habit of calling daily, to wait upon her to inquire about her health, after having been with her the previous night at the play. But she had neither seen him, nor had a line from him. Mr. Laurens had taken a cold by the previous night's exposure, and could not go out, or she would have urged him to call and see if Edward was ill. She feared indeed that this was the reason she did not see him, as he had appeared to her far from well when he left her after seeing her home. Evening had come, and now she thought that he would certainly come if he were not really ill. Her father, seeing her anxiety, got her to read the newspaper to him; but she read without her thoughts, until she lighted upon a very touching account of the suicide of Harry Collins, which she read with emotion. `Collins! The same young gentleman that dined and took wine with us yesterday! Is it possible?' exclaimed Mr. Laurens, and he caught the paper from her. The paragraph was in substance like that Edward had read, and which had driven him to the anguish and remorse which led him, along with a stinging sense of lost self-esteem, to throw away his life! It however contained in addition this to sentence. `We learn that the unfortunate young officer was seen taking wine at table with two gentlemen, one of whom, by his age and standing in society should have known better than to place the tempting wine-cup in the hands of young men. If old respectable men must drink wine, let them drink it alone, not where their example will lead young men astray. It has been asserted by a friend of the deceased Mr. Collins, who sat near him, that he had not touched wine when he left the table, but that he afterwards was seen seated half an hour taking wine with these persons!' `My God! That alludes to me! I am the man! cried Mr. Laurens with a groan of anguish. `Anne I have done my part to kill that young man! This is horrible! I never before conceived that I have been doing wrong in taking wine! But see what it has brought this poor young man to! But then. I did not take the first glass of wine with him!' `Who did?' asked Anne pale and trembling at this self-condemnation of her parent. Mr. Laurens would have recalled his last words, but it was too late. He had to reply, but saw at once in what position it would place one so dear to her. `It was Edward! He asked him to take a glass of wine with us! But— he nor I did'nt know— `Oh, my father, my father! Do not speak one word more! I cannot bear this! who first taught Edward? You—I alone are guilty! He, he is innocent! We are— The street bell sharply rung. `It is he! Oh, I trust he has not heard of this poor young man's fate! It would drive him to despair!' `Mr. Laurens, here is a card for you!' said Plato, pale and trembling. `From him!' she cried with a glow of pleasure, and extending her hand. Mr. Laurens read the first line and suddenly covered his face. `Father! what is it?' she cried, `Is he ill?' He recovered himself, and read again. His face was like marble. She stood with folded hands and eager looks, and scarcely less pale than he, from anticipation of some evil. `Anne!' he said extending his hands; `Anne, my child, God has judged me! Read, read, for I—I cannot tell it you!' We forbear pursuing the painful scene that followed! The pen fails us in the attempt to describe the horror and anguish, the remorse and despair— the utter woe of that hour! The body of the murdered young man was laid out and coffined; and the next day but one, it was born to the tomb, followed by a broken-hearted mother, by a maiden with a wild brain, and reason wandering, and by an old gentleman who seemed the very picture of despair and remorse, and who ceased not to weep like a child, and at intervals call down upon himself the curses of divine vengeance. `As the hearse returned from the place of sepulture, it was detained a moment by a crowd gathered around something on the ground. It was the body of a dead man. He had been ejected, a few moments before, from a miserable rum hole on the corner of the next alley, and being too much intoxicated to take care of himself, he had fallen down and lay in the sewer with his head against a lamp post, when a cart, driven by a drunken carman in turning the corner had struck him with the wheel in the brenst, thrown him down and passed over his head mangling it in the most shocking manner. The body was taken to the dead house in the Park, and in his pocket was found the stopper of a Hunting Flask (that having been long since sold for rum,) on which was engraven the name of `Ralph Waldron, from his friend W. De Wittlesey.' The same afternoon a pine coffin received the remains of the young huntsman who had thus fallen a victim to intemperance, and his body was taken to the Potter's field and thrown into a grave promiscuously with the miserable dead of that week; for there were none to care for him in the tomb of his family, which remained yet ignorant of his miserable end. Roundy, the faithful and simple Roundy, recovered after a long time, only with life, and the loss of his leg which it was found necessary to amputate. He never ceases to mourn his young master's death. Those who feel an interest in him, are informed that he is now returned to his native town, and that the thin, slender, skeleton-looking man with a wooden leg, and a melancholy aspect, who keeps a little cake shop near the village Inn, is the individual in question. Mr. Laurens began rapidly to fail. Wine was recommended and prescribed by his physicians, to revive his strength; bul he firmly refused to touch it, saying that death was preferable to existence, prolonged by that which had been the death of Edward; for he had learned by the letters left by Edward, the whole history of his temptations, just as the reader has learned them, and knew that he had placed in his hand the cup which had been drugged with his death. In two months, he followed to the tomb his victim! Poor Anne never recovered her reason. She remained a few months an inmate of the asylum at Bloomingdale, and, at length died, in her last words denouncing herself as the murderer of Edward. THE END.</field>
