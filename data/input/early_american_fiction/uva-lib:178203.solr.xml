      <field name="fulltext">NEW WORKS PUBLISHED BY CAREY, LEA &amp; BLANCHARD. In 2 vols. 12mo., THE POETRY OF LIFE, by Sarah Stickney. “Poetry has been to me its own `exceeding great reward.' It has soothed my afflictions, it has multiplied and refined my enjoyments; it has endeared solitude, and it has given me the habit of wishing to discover the good and the beautiful in all that meets and surrounds me.” —Coleridge. With Coloured Plates, the Second Edition of THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS, elegantly bound in Morocco, with gilt edges. With a Coloured Plate, THE CHRISTIAN FLORIST; containing the English and botanical names of different plants, with their properties briefly delineated and explained; illustrated by texts of Scripture, and accompanied with poetical extracts from various authors. Elegantly bound with gilt edges. With numerous Wood Cuts, THE YOUTH'S BOOK OF THE SEASONS; or, Nature familiarly developed. “We propose to converse with our young readers in a familiar and confidential style; to take our way with them through many pleasant paths and shady nooks by the still waters of the valley, and over the steep mountain top, to point out the fair works of the Creator to their grateful admiration, and to draw many delightful and useful lessons from his wonderful and beneficent arrangement of the varying seasons.” —Extract from Preface. In 2 vols. 12mo., PENCIL SKETCHES; or, Outlines of Character and Manners. By Miss Leslie. In 2 vols. 12mo., CLINTON BRADSHAW; or, The Adventures of a Lawyer. The New York American thus closes a notice of Clinton Bradshaw:—“The author of Clinton Bradshaw has, we think, avoided, if we may so speak, this literary error of the day; he has had the boldness not only to describe society as it may fall within the observation of the majority of his readers, but to be natural in the description; and herein lies the peculiar charm of the work—it is so natural we think it must be true; neither is it wanting in pathos or power.” Dr. Bird. THE HAWKS OF HAWK HOLLOW. A Tradition of Pennsylvania. By the author of “Calavar” and “The Infidel.” In 2 vols. 12 mo. “We have heretofore seen the genius of Dr. Bird pourtraying the adventures of the Spanish conquerors, and delineating the haughty heroes of old romance; but in the Hawks of Hawk Hollow, we have men and women of every day life, in whose adventures we can lose ourselves. The mingled yarn, too, is well made up; romantic incident, sentiment, pathos, humour, and the terrific, combine in the incidents, as we feel they must combine in similar circumstances.” —Traveller.

      <field name="fulltext">B A REMINISCENCE OF FEDERALISM. “Oh shame on men! devil with devil damn'd, Firm concord holds: men only disagree Of creatures rational, though under hope Of heavenly grace: and God proclaiming peace, Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife.” Milton. A calm observer who has scarcely lived half the age of man, must look back with a smile at human frailty, rather than with a harsher feeling upon the subjects that have broken the world in which he has lived, (be it a little or a great one,) into opposed and contending parties. The stream for a while glides on with an unbroken surface, a snag interposes, and the waters divide, and fret, and foam around it till chance or time sweep it away, when they again commingle, and flow on in their natural unruffled union. This is the common course of human passions. The subject in dispute may be more or less dignified; the succession to an empire, or to a few acres of sterile land; the rival claims of candidates to the Presidency, or competitors for a village clerkship; the choice of a minister to England, or the minister of our parish; the position of a capital city, or of an obscure meeting house;[1] [1] This fruitful subject of dispute has rent asunder many a village society in New England. the excellence of a Catalini, or of a rustic master of psalmody; a dogma in religion or politics; in short anything, to which, as with the shield in the fable, there are two sides. Some who have lived to swell the choral song to Adams and Jefferson, and blend their names in one harmonious peal, will remember when the one, in his honest estimation, was a patriot hero, and the other the arch enemy of his country. For myself, having been bred, according to the strictest sect of my political religion, a federalist, I regarded Mr. Jefferson, (whom all but his severest enemies do not now deny, to have been a calm, and at least well-intentioned philosopher,) as embodying in his own person whatever was impracticable, heretical and corrupt in politics, religion and morals. Some impressions of my early childhood which were connected with the subsequent fate of obscure but interesting individuals, have preserved a vivid recollection of those party strifes that should now only be remembered to assuage the heat of present controversies. I was sent when a very young child, (I am not the hero of my own story, my readers must therefore bear with a little prefatory egotism,) to pass the summer in a clergyman's family in Vermont, in a village which I shall take the liberty to call Carrington. Whether I was sent there for the advantage of a better school than my own village afforded, or for the flattering reason that governs the disposition of most younger children in a large family, to be got out of the way, the domestic archives do not reveal. Whatever was the motive, I am indebted to the fact for some of the most interesting recollections of my life. The first absence from home is a period never forgotten, and always vivid. How well do I remember the aspect of that long, broad, and straight street that traversed the village of Carrington, as it appeared to me when I first entered it. The meeting house, with its tall, grenadier looking steeple; the freshly painted school house, the troop of shouting boys springing from its portal; the neat white houses with Venetian blinds, and pretty court-yards and gardens, the dwellings of the physician, the lawyer, and the merchant, the modest gentry of the place; and that, to my youthful vision, colossal piece of architecture, a staring flaming mansion, (I afterwards learned that Squire Hayford was its master,) with pilasters, pillars and piazzas, a balustrade, cupola, and four chimneys! Even then I turned my eyes from this chef-d'œuvre of rustic art to the trees by the way side, whose topmost boughs in their freshest green, (for summer was still in its youth,) were flushed with the beams of the setting sun. And I eagerly gazed at the parsonage which stood at the extremity of the plain, flanked by an orchard of scrawny neglected apple trees, its ill-proportioned form, and obtrusive angles sheltered by the most ample elm that ever unfolded its rich volume of boughs. A willow there was too, I remember, that hung its tresses over the old well-curb, for there Fanny Atwood and I have cracked many a “last year's butternut,” sweeter to us far than the freshest, most flavorous nuts of the south, or any thing else would now be. It is difficult, in our levelling and disenchanted days, to recall the awe that thirty years ago the puritan clergy of New England inspired in the minds of children. Who is there bred in the land of the pilgrims, that has not in his memory an immaculate personage, tall or short but always erect, with a three-cornered cocked hat, long blue yarn stockings drawn over the knee, silver shoe buckles and a silver headed cane, looking stern and unrelenting, as if he embodied the terrors of the law? Who does not remember depressing his voice and checking the “little footsteps that lightly pressed the ground,” as he passed the minister's house, the domain that seemed to him to shut out all human sympathies, to stand between heaven and earth, a certain purgatory, at least to all youthful sinners? With such prepossessions I entered Dr. Atwood's family. The Doctor himself was absent on some pastoral duty when I arrived. I was soon put at my ease by the hospitalities of his social family. How the prejudices of childhood melt away and disappear in the first beam of kindness! A most kind and simple hearted race were the Atwoods. Miss Sally, the oldest, was housekeeper; a bountiful provider of “spring beer,” cherry pies and gingerbread. Man and woman too, and above all a child, is an eating animal. The record of her culinary virtues remains long after every other trace of good Miss Sally has faded from my mind. The second sister was Miss Nancy, a “weakly person” she was called, and truly was. I can see her pale serious face now, in which sensibility to her own ailments, and solicitude for those of her fellow mortals, were singularly blended; her slender tall figure, as she stood shaking that vial with contents so mysterious to me, which she called her “mixture;” her hands all veins and chords that seemed to have been made to spread plasters. Miss Nancy, in poetic phrase, was a “culler of simples.” She gathered herbs, (my friend Fanny called them sickness,) for all the village, and administered them too. She could tell with unerring certainty when motherwort would kill, and boneset would cure. Forgive me, gentle reader, (for Miss Nancy could not,) if I have mistaken an alias for a species. In brief, Miss Nancy was one of those prudent apprehensive people peculiarly annoying to children. Her memory was a treasure house of hair breadth escapes and fatal accidents; and her eye, like that of a speculator devouring the prices of stocks, would fix upon that imaginative column in the newspapers devoted to the enumeration of such fancy articles as “caution to youths;” “fatal sport;” “hydrophobia!” &amp;c., &amp;c. Malvina was the third daughter; I knew little of her, for she was a lady of the shears, and pursued her calling by keeping the even tenor of her way through the neighbourhood, making “auld claiths look amaist as weel's the new.” I should have said that Malvina was among the few who would go through life content with the sphere Providence had assigned B 2 her, without one craving from that “divinity that stirs within;” limiting her ambition to pleasing the little boys, and satisfying their mammas, and her desires to her well-earned twenty-five cents per day. But Malvina married and emigrated. Her husband was, as I have heard, a disciple of Tom Paine, and poor Melvina, who was only adequate to shape a sleeve or collar, began to reason of “fate and free will,” foreknowledge absolute; and afterwards, when she visited her friends, she bewailed their irrational views, wondered they could believe the Bible! and would have enlightened them with that precious text-book, the Age of Reason, had not Dr. Atwood consigned it forthwith to an auto-de-fé. The doctor, according to the common custom of New England clergymen, who have an income of four or five hundred dollars a year, had educated several sons at college. One was a thriving attorney and counsellor at law, in New York, and two others, (who closed the account of the doctor's first marriage,) were keeping school, and qualifying themselves for the learned professions. The doctor in middle life, as it is by courtesy called, but long after his sun had declined from its meridian, had married a young and very pretty girl, who, by all accounts, looked much beside her autumnal consort, like a fresh blown rose attached to a stalk of sere and yellow leaves. The human frailty the doctor betrayed in his preference of this lamb of his flock over certain quite mature candidates for his conjugal favour, gave such scandal to his parish that the good man was fain to leave Connecticut, the land of his forefathers, and remove to Vermont, then called the new state, where his domestic arrangements were viewed with more indulgence. His wife, who seems to have had no fault but that one which was mending every day, died in the course of a few years, after having augmented the doctor's wealth by the addition of one child. This child was the gem of the family, and a gem of “purest ray serene,” was my little friend Fanny. Fanny Atwood! Writing her name, even at this distance of time, makes my heart beat quicker. Affection has its bright, its immortal names, that will live after the trump of fame is a broken instrument, and the names it has pealed over the world are with all forgotten things. Perhaps I commit a mistake in making Fanny Atwood the heroine of a story. It may be that like those wild flowers she so much resembled, that are so delicate and sweet in their native green wood, but so fragile that they fade and droop as soon as they are exposed to the eye of the sun, and appear spiritless and insignificant when compared with the splendid belles of the green-house, on which the art of the horticulturist has been exhausted, so my little rustic favourite may seem tame, and she and her fortunes be derided by the fine ladies, if any such grace my humble tale with a listening ear. I have known those who have drank of the tainted waters of a city till they confessed that the pure element as it welled up from the green turf, or sparkled in the crystal fountain of a mountain rock, was tasteless and disagreeable! But I know those too, who, though they have mastered the music of Rossini, have yet ears and hearts for wood notes wild. Nature is too strong for art, and those who are accustomed to the refinements of artificial life, may look without a “disdainful smile” on Fanny Atwood as she was when I first saw her; as she continued, the picture of simplicity and all loveable qualities. She had a little round Hebe form. Her neck, chest, shoulders and arms were the very beau ideal of a French dress maker, so fair and fat; her hands were formed in the most delicate mould, and dimpled as an infant's; her hair was of the tinge between flaxen and brown; glossy and wavy. Her mouth bore the signet of the sweet and playful temper that bade defiance to all the curdling tendencies of life, it was certainly the fittest organ for “words o' kindness” that could be formed. She had a slight lisp; graceful enough in childhood, but happily, as she grew up, it wore off. The line of her nose was sufficiently Grecian to be called so by her admirers, but her eyes, I am compelled to confess, even while I yet feel their warm and gentle beam upon me, were not according to the rule of beauty; they were clear and bright as health and cheerfulness could make them, but they lacked many shades of the violet, and were smaller than the orthodox heroine dimensions. If my bill of particulars fail to present the image of my friend, let my readers embody health, good humour, order, a disinterestedness, considerateness or mindfulness, a quick sympathy with joy and sorrow, in the image of a girl of nine years, and it cannot fail to resemble Fanny Atwood. She would have been a spoiled child, if unbounded love and indulgence could have spoiled her; but she was like those fruits and flowers which are only made more beautiful or flavorous by the fervid rays of the sun. She sometimes tried Miss Sally's patience by a too free dispensation of the luxuries of her frugal pantry, and Miss Nancy's by deriding her herb teas, even “that sovereignest thing on earth,” her motherwort; and once, when in the act of raising a dose of the panacea, the mixture, to her lips, she let fall dose, vial and all; accidentally, no doubt; but poor Miss Nancy! I think her nerves never quite recovered the shock. However, these offences were soon forgiven, and would have been, if magnified a hundred fold, for in the touching language of old Israel, Fanny “was the only child of her mother, and her mother was dead.” I was within a few months of Fanny's age when we first met, and with the facility of childhood we became friends in half an hour. She had presented me to her two favourites, a terrier puppy and a black cat, between whom she had so assiduously cultivated a friendship that she had converted their natural gall into honey, and they coursed up and down the house together to the infinite amusement of my friend, and the perpetual annoyance of the elderly members of the family. Nothing could better illustrate Fanny's power, than the indulgence she obtained for these little pests. Miss Sally prided herself on her discipline of animals, but she was brought to wink at Fido's misdeeds, suffered him to sleep all day by the winter's fire, and when she once or twice resolutely ordered him out for the night, she was persuaded by Fanny to get up out of her warm bed and let him in. And the cat, though Miss Nancy's aversion, fairly installed herself on a corner of Fanny's chair, and was thrice a day fed from her plate. As I have said, Fanny and I made rapid progress in our friendship. She had introduced me to her little family of dolls, which were all patriotic, all of home manufacture, and I had offered to her delighted vision my compagnon de voyage a London doll; in our eyes, the master piece of the arts. We were consulting confidently on some matters touching our respective families, when I heard the lumbering sound of the doctor's chaise, and I felt a chill come over me like that of poor Jack, the bean-climer of aspiring memory, when seated at the giant's hearth, and chattering with his lady, he first heard the homeward step of her redoubtable lord and master. My prejudiees against the clerical order were certainly not dispelled by my first impressions of Doctor Atwood. He wore a thick set foxy wig, cut by a semi-circular around the forehead. His chin was not a freshly mown stubble field, for it was Saturday, and the doctor shaved but once a week. His figure was tall and corpulent, and altogether he presented a lowering and most forbidding aspect to one who had been accustomed to a more advanced state of civilization than his person indicated. I had retreated to the furthest corner of the room, dropped my head and hidden my doll in my handkerchief, when Fanny, to my astonishment, dragging me into notice, exclaimed in the most affectionate tone, “Oh, father, how glad I am you have come! I wanted you to see C—'s doll; she is the most perfect beauty! are you not glad she's come?” Now meaning me, not the doll. The doctor made no reply for a moment, and when he did, he merely said, without a sign of courtesy or even humanity, “How d'ye do, child, pretty well?” “Father!” exclaimed Fanny in a tone which betrayed her mortification and disappointment. I shrank away to my seat, but Fanny remained hovering about the place where her father stood, lost apparently in sullen abstraction. The doctor sat down. Fanny seated herself on his knee; I wondered she could. “How funny your wig looks! father,” she said, “it's all awry.” Then laughing, and giving it a fearless twirl, she took a comb from the doctor's waistcoat pocket, smoothed it down, threw her fat arms round his neck and kissed him first on one cheek, then on the other, saying, “you look quite handsome, now, father!” Scanty as my literature was, a classical allusion occurred to me; “Beauty and the Beast!” thought I, but far would it have been from the nature of that Beast to have been as dull to the caresses of Beauty as the doctor seemed to Fanny's. She was evidently perplexed by his apparent apathy; for a moment she laid her cheek to his, then sprang from his knee and went to a cupboard about ten inches square, made in the chimney beside the fireplace, (an anomaly in architecture, these puritan cupboards were,) and drew from it a long pipe, filled, lighted, and put it in her father's lips. He received it passively, smoked it with continued unconsciousness, and when the tobacco was exhausted, threw pipe and all out of the window. Fanny looked at me and laughed, then suddenly changing to an expression of solicitude, she leaned her elbow on the doctor's knee, looked up in his face, and said in a voice that must penetrate to the heart, “what is the matter, father?” The doctor seemed suddenly to recover his faculties; to come to himself, in common phrase, and with tears gushing from his eyes, he said, “Fanny, my child, poor Randolph's mother is dead.” “Dead, father! What will Randolph do?” “Do, Fanny?” replied the doctor, brushing off his tears, “why he will do his duty; no easy matter in the poor boy's case.” The doctor then proceeded to relate the scene he had just come from witnessing, and which had melted one of the tenderest hearts that ever was in a human frame, uncouth and repelling as that frame was. The facts which will explain the doctor's emotions are briefly these. There was a certain Squire Hayford residing in Carrington, the proprietor of the stately mansion we have noticed. He was a democrat, according to the classification of that day, and one of the most impassioned order. A democrat in theory, but in his own little sphere as absolute a despot as ever sat on a throne. He was the wealthiest man in Carrington, owned most land, and had most ready money; in short, he was the great man of the place, and, as was happily said on another occasion, “the smallest of his species.” Of all the men I ever met with he had the most unfounded and absurd vanity. His opinions were all prejudices, and in each and all of them he held himself infallible. He was the centre of his world, the sun of his system, which he divided into concentric circles. Himself first, then his household, his town, his county, his state, &amp;c. Fortunately for himself, he had adopted the popular side in politics, and with a character that would have been particularly odious to the sovereign people, he made himself an oracle among them. This man had one child, a daughter, a gentle and lovely woman as she was described to me, who some fourteen years before my story begins, had married a Mr. Gordon, from one of the Southern States. It was a clandestine marriage. Squire Hayford having refused his consent, because Gordon was a “southerner,” and he held all “southerners” in utter contempt and aversion, and never graced them with any other name than slave-drivers, with the addition of such expletives as might give force to the reproach. Gordon was a high spirited man and an ardent lover, and he easily persuaded Miss Hayford to escape from the unreasonable opposition of her father, and transfer her allegiance to him. This was her first disobedience, but disobedience to him was an unpardonable sin in the squire's estimation, and he permitted his only child to encounter the severest evils, and languish through protracted sufferings, before he manifested the slightest relenting. She lost several children; she became a widow, was reduced to penury, and sacrificed her health in one of our southern cities, in an attempt to gain a livelihood as governess. Her father then sent her a pitiful sum of money, and information that a small house in Carrington, belonging to him was vacant, and she might come and occupy it if she would. The kindness was scanty, and the manner of it churlish enough; but disease and penury cut off all fastidiousness, and Mrs. Gordon returned to Carrington with her only son Randolph. Here she languished month after month. The bare necessities of existence were indirectly supplied by her father, but he never visited her, never spoke to her, and, what affected her more deeply, he never noticed her son, never betrayed a consciousness of his existence. Adversity, if it does not sever the ties of nature, multiplies and strengthens them. Never was there a tenderer union than that which subsisted between Randolph and his mother, and nothing could have been more natural than Fanny's exclamation when told of Mrs. Gordon's death, for it seemed as if the life of parent and child were fed from the same fountain. As my readers are now acquainted with the relative position of the parties, I shall give the doctor's account to Fanny in his own words. “I left the chaise at Mrs. Gordon's door, my child,” said he, “that Randolph might take her to ride. They had ridden but a short distance when she complained of faintness, and Randolph turned back. She had fainted quite away just as they stopped at their own door. There was a man riding past; Randolph called to him for help. He came and assisted in carrying the poor lady to her bed. When she recovered her senses, she looked up and saw the man; it was her father, Fanny!” “Her father! what, that hateful old Squire Hayford?” “Yes, my child. Providence brought him to her threshold at the critical moment. When I called for the chaise, I went in. I saw she was dying. Randolph was bathing her head with camphor, and his tears dropped on the pillow like rain. Her father stood a little way from the bed. He looked pale and his lip quivered. Ah, Fanny, my child, death takes hold of the heart that nothing else will reach. When Mrs. Gordon heard my step she looked up at me and said, `I believe I am dying; pray with me once more Dr. Atwood; pray that my father may forgive—that —he—may—' and here her voice faltered, but she looked at Randolph, and I understood her, and went to prayer.” “But, father, what did Squire Hayford do? you know he swore a horrid oath last Independence that he would never hear `Parson Fed[2] [2] Federalist. pray again.”' “Yes, yes, Fanny, I remember, and he remembered too, for he walked out of the door and stood in the porch, but I took care to raise my voice so loud that he could not help hearing me. The Lord assisted me, my child; words came to me faster than I could utter them; thoughts, but not my thoughts; words, C but not of my choosing, for they pierced even my own heart. When I had done, Squire Hayford came in, walked straight to the bed, and said, `Mary, I forgive you; I wish your troubles may be all at an end, but I am not answerable for your past sufferings; I told you what you must expect when you married that southern beggar.”' “Father,” exclaimed Fanny, “why did you not stop him?” “I did long to knock him down, Fanny, and I thought Randolph would, for his black eyes flashed fire; but oh, how quick they fell again when his mother looked up like a dying saint as she was, and said, `Father, let the past be past.”' “`Well,' said he, `so I will; and as I am a man of deeds and not of words, I promise you I will do well by your boy; I will take him home, and he shall be the same as a son to me, provided—”' “Here he paused. I think she did not hear his last word, for her face lighted up, she clasped her hands and thanked God for crowning with such mercy her dying hour; then she drew Randolph down to her, kissed him, and said, `now, my son, I can die in peace.' `But,' said her father, `you have not heard me out, Mary. Randolph must give up the name of Gordon for that of Hayford—”' “Oh, father,” interrupted Fanny, “he did not, did he?” “Let me finish, child. The poor lady at the thought of her son giving up his dead father's name, heaved a sigh so deep and heavy, that I feared her breath would have gone with it. She looked at Randolph, but he turned away his eye. `My dear child,' she said, `it must be; it is hard for me to ask and you to do, but it must be; speak Randolph, say you accept the terms.” “Thus pressed, the poor boy spoke, and spoke out his heart, `Do not ask me that, mother,' he said; `give up my dear father's name! No, never, never!”' “`My child, you must, you will be destitute; without a home, a friend, a morsel of bread.”' “`I shall not be destitute, mother, I can work, and is not Doctor Atwood my friend! and besides, mother, I care not what becomes of me when you are gone.”' “`But I do, my son; I cannot leave you so. Oh, promise me, Randolph.”' “`Do not ask me, mother; I cannot give up the name I love and honour above all others, for that—' I know not what the poor boy might have said, for his mother stopped him. `Listen to me, my son,' she said, `my breath is almost spent; you know how I have been punished for one act of disobedience; how much misery I brought on your dear father, on all of us; you may repair my fault. Oh, give me peace, promise to be faithful in your mother's place to her father.”' “`I will promise any thing, dear mother; I will do any thing but take his name.”' “`All is useless without that;' her voice sunk to a whisper,—`dear, dear child,' she added, `it is my last wish.' I saw her countenance was changing, and I believe I said, `she is going,' and poor Randolph cried out, `Mother, mother, I will do every thing you ask—I promise—' a sweet smile spread over her face. He laid his cheek to her's, she tried to kiss him, but her lips never moved again, and in a few moments, my dear Fanny, she was with the saints in heaven.” Fanny's tears had coursed down her cheeks as her father had proceeded in his narration. Soon after I heard her repeating to herself, “Randolph Hayford, Randolph Hayford; I will never call him anything but Randolph; but I suppose I shall not often have a chance to call him anything. That cross old Squire Hayford hates you so, father, he'll never let Randolph come and see us; he'll never let him go anywhere but to some dirty democrat's.” I now look back, almost unbelieving of my own recollections, at the general diffusion of the political prejudices of those times. No age nor sex was exempt from them. They adhered to an old man to the very threshold of another world, and they sometimes clouded the serene heaven of such a mind as my friend Fanny Atwood's. The rival parties in Carrington were so nearly balanced, that each individual's weight was felt in the scale. All qualities and relations were merged in the political attribute. I have often heard, when the bell tolled the knell of a departed neighbour, the most kind hearted person say, “we” or “they have lost a vote!” Good Doctor Atwood was as sturdy in his political as in his religious faith. He had a vein of humanity like my Uncle Toby's, that tempered his judgment in individual cases, but in the abstract, I rather think he believed that none but federalists and the orthodox, according to the sound school of the Mathers and Cottons, could enter the kingdom of heaven. With this creed, with an ardent temperament that glowed to the last hour of his life, and with the faculty of expressing pithily what he felt strongly, and without fear or awe of mortal man, he was, of course, loved almost to idolatry by his own party, and hated in equal measure by the rival faction. I have said that the village street of Carrington traversed a hill and plain. The democrats for the most part occupied the hill. What an infected district it then seemed to me! The federalists (alas! was it an augury of their descending fortunes?) lived in the vale. The most picturesque object in the village, and one as touching to the sentimental observer as Sterne's dead ass, was a superannuated horse; a poor commoner, who picked up an honest living by the way side. His walk was as regular as Edie Ochiltree's, or any other licensed gaberlunzie's. He began in the morning, and grazing along, he arrived about midday at the end of his tour, he then crossed the street and returned, now and then resting his weary limbs in the shadow of a tree planted by the way side. Thus sped his innocent life. It was an edifying sight to see the patience and satisfaction with which he gleaned his scanty portion of the bounties of nature. Jacques would have moralized on the spectacle. The children called him Clover, why, I know not, unless it were an allusion to his green old age. He was a great favourite with the little urchins; the youngest among them were wont to make their first equestrian essays on Clover's bare back. My friend Fanny's gentle heart went out towards him in the respect that waits on age. Many a time have I known her to abstract a measure of oats from the parson's frugal store, and set it under the elm tree for Clover, and as she stood by him while he was eating, patting and stroking him, he would look round at her with an expression of mute gratitude and fondness, that words could not have rendered more intelligible. Strange as it may seem, even poor Clover was converted into a political instrument. This “innocent beast and of a good conscience,” was made to supply continual fuel to the inflammable passions of the fiery politicians of Carrington. His sides were pasted over with lampoons in which the rival factions vented their wit or their malignity safe from personal responsibility, for Clover could tell no tales. Thus he trudged from the hill, a walking gazette, his ragged and grizzled sides covered with these militant missives, and returned bearing the responses of the valley, as unconscious of his hostile burden, as the mail is of its portentous contents. Sometimes, indeed, Clover carried that which was more accordant with his kind and loving nature. As Fanny had predicted, after Randolph's removal to the great house, his grandfather prohibited his visits at Doctor Atwood's, but Fanny often met him in the C 2 lagging walk to school, berrying, nutting, and on all neutral ground, and when they did not meet, they maintained a continual correspondence by Clover. The art was simple by which they secured their billetdoux from the public eye, but it sufficed. The inside contained the effusion of their hearts. The outside was scribbled with some current political sarcasm or joke. The initial letter of Randolph's superscription was always F., Fanny's G., for she tenaciously adhered to the name of Gordon. The communications were attached by the corners to Clover. I found recently among some forgotten papers one of Fanny's notes, and childish as it is, I shall make no apology for inserting it verbatim. “Dear Randolph—I thank you a thousand times and so does C—, for the gold eagles. There never was anything in the world so beautiful, I do'nt believe. They are far before the grown up ladies. We shall certainly wear them to meeting next Sabbath, and fix them so every body in the world can see them, and not let the bow of ribbon fall down over them, as Miss Clarke did last Sabbath, cause she has got that old democrat, Doctor Star, for a sweetheart; but I managed her nicely, Randolph. In prayer time when she did not dare move, I whirled round the bow so the eagle stood up bravely, and flashed right in Doctor Star's eyes. I did not care so very much about having an eagle for myself, (though I do now since you have given it to me,) but I thought it very important for C— to wear the federal badge, because her father is a senator in Congress. Father is almost as pleased as we are. I see Clover coming and I must make haste; poor old fellow! I heard his tread when it stormed so awfully last night, and I got father to put him up in our stable. Was not he proper good? It was after prayers, too, and his wig was off and his knee buckles out. There, they all go out of Deacon Garfield's to read Clover's papers. Good by, dear, dear Randolph. F. A.” If my readers are inclined to smile at the defects of my heroine's epistle, they must remember those were not the days when girls studied Algebra, and read Virgil in the original before they were ten years old. Besides, I have not claimed for Fanny intellectual brilliancy. The manifestations of her mind were (where some bel esprits last look for it,) in the conduct of her daily life. But I am fondly lingering on the childhood of my friend. I must resolutely pass over the multitude of anecdotes that occur to me, to those incidents that are sufficiently dignified for publication. Eight years flowed on without working any other change in the condition of my friends in Carrington than is commonly effected by the passage of time. Doctor Atwood continued his weekly ministrations, varied only by a slight verbal alteration in his prayer. During Mr. Adams's presidency, he implored the Lord to continue to us rulers endued with the spirit of their station. When Mr. Jefferson became chief magistrate, he substituted “give” for continue. Miss Sally still brewed and backed with her accustomed energy. Miss Nancy by the too lavish consumption of her own nostrums, had lost everything but her shadow. Squire Hayford was more opinionated and insufferable than ever. Poor old Clover was dead, and at Fanny's request, had been honourably interred beneath the elm tree, his favourite poste restante. Fanny had preserved the distinctive traits of her childhood, and at seventeen, was as good humoured, as simple, as lovely and, (as more than one thought,) far more loveable than when I first knew her. The sad trials of Randolph's youth had early ripened his character, and had given to it an energy and self-government that he could have derived alone from the discipline of such circumstances. The lofty spirit of his father had fallen on him like the mantle of an ascending prophet. His mother's concentrated tenderness had fostered his sensibility, and the influence of her dying hour passed not away with the days of mourning, but stamped his whole after life. Who has ever lost a friend, without that feeling so natural, that a painter of nature has put it into the mouth of a man lamenting over a dead beast? “I am sure thou hast been a merciful master to him,” said I. “Alas!” said the mourner, “I thought so when he was alive, but now that he is dead I think otherwise.” The solution of this universal lamentation and just suffering, must be found in the fact that the very best fall far short of the goodness of which their Creator has made them capable. It is in the spirit of expiation that far more deference is paid to the wishes of the dead than the living; and affectionate and devoted as Randolph was to his mother, I doubt if she had lived, that she ever could have persuaded him to the sacrifices and efforts he made for her sake when she was dead. He immediately assumed the name of Hayford, without expressing a regret, even to Fanny; and accustomed as he had been to the control alone of his gentle mother, he submitted without a murmur to the petty and irritating tyrannies of his grandfather. He suppressed the expression of his opinions and surrendered his strongest inclinations at the squire's command. Never was there a case in which the sanctifying influence of a pure motive was more apparent. The same deference which Randolph paid to his relative, might have been rendered by a sordid dependant, but then where would have been that moral power which gave Randolph an ascendancy even over the narrow and unperceiving mind of his grandfather, and which achieved another and a more honourable triumph. A Mrs. Hunt, a widowed sister of the squire, presided over the female department of his family. She was a well intentioned woman, a meek and patient drudge, who had been content to toil in his house year after year, for the poorest of all compensations, presents; the common and wretched requital for the services of relations. Mrs. Hunt had been sustained in her endurance by a largess that now and then fell upon her eldest son, and by the hope that ultimately her brother's fortune would descend to her unportioned children. This hope was suddenly blighted by his adoption of Randolph; and Randolph, of course, became the object of her dislike, and he daily suffered those annoyances and discomforts which a woman always has in her power to inflict. To these he opposed a respectful deportment; a mindfulness of her convenience and comfort, and a generous attention to her children, which smoothed her rugged path, and all unused as she was to such humanities, won her heart. It was not long before the good woman found herself going to him, whom she had regarded as her natural enemy, for aid and sympathy in all her troubles. If I am prosing, my readers must forgive me. It has always seemed to me that we may get the most useful lessons from those who are placed in circumstances not uncommon, nor striking, but to which a parallel may be found in every day's experience. It is a common doctrine, but one not favourable to virtue, that characters are formed by circumstances. If it be true, my friend Randolph was a noble exception; his character controlled circumstances; and, by the best of all alchymy, he extracted wholesome food out of the materials that might have been poison to another. His boyish affection for Fanny Atwood had ripened into the tenderest love, and was fully returned, without my friend ever having endured the reserve and distrust that are supposed to be necessary to the progress of the passion. Trials their love had, but they came from without. Dr. Atwood had heard the squire had said, “the parson might try his best to get his heir for his daughter Fanny; he'd never catch his heir, though he caught Randolph!” The good doctor was a proud father, and a poor man, and, though it cost him many a heartache, he shut his doors against Randolph. Meanwhile, the squire's self complacency in Randolph increased. The squire had the art of making everybody's merit or demerit minister to this great end of his being. He was proud of his talents, his scholarship and his personal elegance, though his facsimile resemblance to his father was so striking, that the squire was never heard to speak of his appearance, except to say, “what a crop of hair he has—just like all the Hayfords!” There was one peculiarity about Randolph, that puzzled his grandfather. “The fellow is so inconsistent,” said he to himself one day, after he had been reviewing his account books; “when he has money of his own earning, he pours it out like water; gave the widow fifty dollars last week, but he seems as afraid of spending my cash as if I exacted Jews' usury; quite contrary to the old rule, `light come, light go.' I have footed it right; eight years since Mary died—day after we lost Martin's election by the parson's vote; can't be mistaken; he's got through college, fitted for the law, and I have paid out cash for him but ninety-nine pounds, five shillings, and three pence, lawful! By George! the widow's brood has cost me more in that time. Ah! it's number one after all; is sure of it at last, and that southern blood can't bear an obligation. Trust me for seeing into a millstone. I can tell him he'll have to wait; I feel as young as I did thirty years ago; sound grinders—good pulse—steady gait. Ten years to run up to three score, and ten may last to eighty. Grandmother Brown lived to ninety and upwards; why should not I? when I quit, am willing Randolph, (wish his name was Silas,) should have it. If it was not for that southern blood he'd be about the likeliest of the Hayfords. All his obstinacy comes from that `I'll not disobey you, sir, and even if I would, Miss Atwood would not marry me without your consent; but be assured, sir, I shall never marry any other!' `We'll see, my lord; while I can say nay, you shall never marry that old aristocrat's daughter. Just one-and-twenty now; guess you'll sing another tune before you are twenty-five. Time to go up to the printing office; wonder if we shall have another Hampden this week—confounded smart fellow that.” Then looking at his watch and finding the happy hour for country ennuyes, the hour for the mail and daily lounge, had arrived, the squire sallied forth to take his morning walk to the printing office, the village reading room. There was a weekly journal published in Carrington, the “Star,” or “Sun,” I forget which, but certainly the ascendant luminary of the democrat party. There had appeared, recently, in this journal, a series of articles written temperately, and with vigour and elegance, on the safety of a popular government. The writer advocated an unlimited trust in the sanitive virtue of the people; he appeared familiar with the history of the republics that had preceded ours, and contended that there was no reason to infer our danger from their brief existence. He maintained, (and it will now perhaps be admitted with truth,) that distrust of the people was the great error of the federalists; that the prestiges of the old government still hung about them, and that they were committing a fatal mistake in applying old principles to a new condition of things. These articles were read, lauded and republished. The name of the author was sought, but in vain. Even the printer and editor, (I believe one individual personated both these august characters,) were ignorant, and could only guess that it was judge —, or lawyer —, the lights of the state. But conjecture is not certainty, and the author still remained the “great unknown,” not only of Carrington, but of the county and state. The squire returned from his morning lounge with a fresh journal, containing a new article from Hampden, the signature of the unknown author. A fresh newspaper! Its vapour was as sweet a regale to the little vulgar pug-nose of our village politician as the dews of Helicon to the votaries of the muses. It so happened that Randolph was sitting in the parlour, reading, when the squire came in. “Have you seen the paper, this morning, Randolph?” he asked. “No; I have not.” “I guess not, I have got the first that was struck off. Another article from Hampden, I understand. He is answered in the Boston Sentinel. They own he writes `plausibly, ably and eloquently;' the d— speaks truth for once. I guess the Boston chaps find their match at last.” The squire had a habit not peculiar to him, but rather annoying, of reading aloud a passage that either pleased or displeased him, without any regard to the occupations of those around him. His comments, too, were always expressed aloud. He drew out his spectacles and sat down to the paper. His sister, Mrs. Hunt, was sewing in one corner of the room, and Randolph sitting opposite to him, but apparently absorbed in his book. “Too deuced cool,” grumbled the squire, after reading the first passage. “Ah, he warms in the harness; not up to the mark, though; I wish he'd give 'em one of my pealers.” “Good, good; wonder what the Centinel will say to that. By George, capital! I could not have writ it better. I would have put in more spice, though.” “Ha! true as a prophet. Listen, Randolph.” The squire then read aloud. “We are aware that prediction is not argument, but we venture to prophesy that in twenty years from this time the federal party will have disappeared. The grandsire will have to explain the turn—” “Term, sir,” interposed Randolph. “Yes, yes, term. The grandsire will have to explain the term to the child at his knee. We shall be a nation of republicans, and whenever—” “Wherever, sir.” “So it is; wherever an American is found, at home or aboard—” “Abroad, sir.” This time there was a slight infusion of petulance in Randolph's tone, and still more in the squire's at the repeated interruptions as he proceeded. “At home or abroad, in office or out of it, in high station or low, he will claim to be a Republican, and cherish the title as the noblest and happiest a civilian—” “Citizen, sir—noblest and happiest a citizen can claim.” “Confound you, Randolph!” exclaimed the squire, dropping the paper and fixing his eyes on his grandson; “how do you know the words before I speak them?” This was rather an exclamation of vexation than suspicion. Randolph was conscious that in involuntarily interposing to save his offspring from murder he had risked a secret, and he answered the squire's exclamation with a look of confusion that at once flashed the truth upon his obtuse comprehension. He jumped up, clapped Randolph on the shoulder, exclaiming, “you wrote it yourself, you dog, you can't deny it. It's a credit to you, a credit to the name. But you might have known I should have found you out. Just like all the Hayfords, keep every thing snug till out it comes with a crack.” “I thought all along,” meekly, said Mrs. Hunt, who had been plying her needle unobserved and unobserving, “I thought all along cousin Randolph wrote them pieces.” “Now shut up, widow,” retorted the squire, “you did not think no such thing; just like all fore-thoughts, come afterwards. Now, ma'am please to step out; D I must have a little private conversation with Mr. Hampden.” “Be kind enough before you go, aunt,” said Randolph, “to promise me that you will say nothing of what has just passed. I have made no admissions, and I do not wish to be thought the writer of the Hampden articles.” Mrs. Hunt, of course, promised fidelity. As soon as she was out of hearing, “What does that mean?” asked the squire. “It is all stuff to make a secret of it any longer.' “I think not, sir. The articles have far more reputation and influence, (if I may believe they have influence,) than if they were known to proceed from a young man whose name has no authority.” “Hoity-toity! who's got a better name than yours? a'nt willing the Hayfords should have the credit, hey?” Randolph did not vouchsafe any reply to the squire's absurd mistake, and after a few moments his gratified vanity regained its ascendancy. “The pieces please me,” said he, “though if you had told me you were writing them I could have given you some hints that would have improved them. They want a little more said about men, less of principles. They want fire, too; egad, I'd send 'em red hot bullets; but they'll do; you've come out like a man, on the right side, and now I believe what I felt scary about before.” Here the squire paused, and fixed one of his most penetrating glances upon Randolph. “I believe you will vote to-morrow, and vote right.” Randolph made no reply. A few words will here be necessary to explain the dilemma in which Randolph was about to be placed. The annual election of a representative to the state legislature was to occur the next day. The rival parties in Carrington were known to their champions to be exactly balanced. There was not a doubtful vote except Randolph Hayford's. He had never yet voted, not having till now arrived at the requisite age. He had not thrown himself into the scale of either party. His opinions were independent, and independently expressed. The squire's hopes of his vote were very much encouraged by the Hampden articles, but still there were circumstances in this case that made him somewhat apprehensive. “Your vote,” resumed the squire, “will decide the election to-morrow.” Again he paused, but without receiving a reply. “I can't have much doubt which way Hampden will vote, but I like to make all sure and fast. Randolph, I know what scion you want to see engrafted on that tree.” The squire pointed to the only picture in his house, a family tree, that in a huge black frame stretched its frightful branches over the parlour fireplace. On these branches hung a regiment of militia captains, majors, colonels, sundry justices of the peace; precious fruit all, supported by an illustrious trunk, a certain Sir Silas Hayford, who flourished in the reign of Charles the First. Strange and inconsistent as it may appear with his ultra democracy, never was there a man prouder of his ancestral dignities, or more anxious to have them transmitted, than our village squire. “Randolph,” he continued, assured of success by the falling of Randolph's eye, and a certain half pleased, half anxious expression that overspread his face. “Randolph, I have always said that I never would give my consent to your marriage with that old aristocratic parson's daughter. But circumstances alter cases. I am a man that hears to reason when I approve of it. I have no fault to find with the girl; never heard her speak; believe she's well enough.” Randolph bit his lips. How hard it is to hear an idolized object spoken of as if she were of the mass of humankind. “To come to the point, Randolph,—if you'll go forward to-morrow like a man, and give in your vote for Martin and make Ross's scale kick the beam, I'll withdraw my opposition to this match. Hear me out. I'll do more for you. I'm pleased with you, Randolph. I've just received the money for my Genesee lands. I'll give you two hundred pounds to buy your law library, and you may go next week to any town in the state you like, and open your office, and be your own man, and take your girl there as soon as you like.” “Good Heaven!” exclaimed Randolph, “you can offer nothing more; the world has nothing more to tempt me.” And he left the room in a state of agitation in which the squire had never before seen him. The squire called after him,—“Take time to consider, Randolph. To-morrow morning is time enough for your answer.” In the course of the evening, Randolph met Fanny Atwood. Whether the meeting was accidental, I cannot pretend to say. It would seem to have been disobedience in my friend to have kept up her intercourse with Randolph after the doctor had shut his doors upon him. But Fanny well knew there was nothing beside herself, the doctor loved so well as Randolph; nothing that in his secret heart he so much desired as to see them united, and that his resolute and rather harsh procedure in excluding Randolph from his house had been a sacrifice of his own inclinations to his honest pride. This being the state of the matter, it cannot appear strange that Fanny should be willing to meet him when “with rosy blush, Summer eve is sinking; When on rills that softly gush, Stars are softly winking; When through boughs that knit the bower, Moonlight gleams are stealing.” Or at any of those times and places which nature's and our poet have appointed to tell “Love's delightful story.” The lovers took a sequestered and favourite walk to a little waterfall at some distance from the village. Here, surrounded by moonlight, the evening fragrance and soft varying and playful shadows, they seated themselves on the fallen trunk of a tree, one of their accustomed haunts. When they first met, Fanny had said, “So, Randolph, your secret is out at last!” “Out! is it?” “Pshaw, you know it is. Your grandfather hinted it at the post office, and the town is ringing with it.” “I am sorry for it. I was aware that my grandfather knew it, but I have seen nobody else to-day. Has your father heard it, Fanny?” “Yes; finding it was out, I told him myself. Dear father! he both laughed and cried.” “Cried!” “Yes; you know that is no uncommon thing for him to do. He was grieved that you had come out on the democratic side, for you know he thinks a democrat next to an infidel; but then he was pleased to find you could write such celebrated articles. He has said all along that they had more sense and reason in them than could be distilled from everything else written by the democrats. Now he is amazed, he says, that a boy, (you know he calls every one a boy that is not forty,) should write so wisely, and above all, so temperately.” “Ah, my dear Fanny, adversity, though a `stern and rugged nurse' she be, enforces a discipline that makes us early wise. Heaven grant that her furnace may not be heated so hot as to consume instead of purifying.” “What do you mean, Randolph? you are very sad this evening. Are you not well? you are not troubled about this secret. I thought you looked very pale; what has happened to you?” Randolph kissed the hand that Fanny in her earnestness had lain on his. “My dearest Fanny,” he replied, D 2 “since you have exchanged those vows with me that pledge us to `halve our sorrows as well as double our joys,' you have condemned yourself to trials too severe for your sweet and gentle spirit.” “Randolph, if my spirit is sweet and gentle, it can the better bear them; and besides, nothing can be a very, very heavy trial that I share with you. But tell me quick what it is? I am sure I shall think of some way of getting rid of it.” Randolph shook his head, and then related his morning's conversation withhis grand father. “Now,” he said, “you see the cruel predicament in which I am placed. You, my beloved Fanny, the object of my fondest hopes, all that makes life attractive and dear to me, are placed within my grasp; an honourable career is opened to me, escape from the galling thraldom of my grandfather's house, from the perpetual annoyance of his vulgarity, his garrulity, jealousy, and petty tyrannies; and this, without the slightest deviation in the spirit or even the letter from my promise to my dying mother.” Randolph paused. Fanny watched every motion of his countenance with breathless expectation; she could not speak; she did not know what remained to be said, but she “guessed and feared.” He proceeded. “But the price, Fanny, the price I am to pay for these ineffable blessings! I must give my vote to an unprincipled demagogue, and withhold it from an honest man. I must sacrifice the principles that I have laid down to govern my conduct. They may be stigmatized as juvenile, romantic, and fantastical; as long as I believe them essential to integrity, I cannot depart from them without a consciousness of degradation. My moral sense is not yet dimmed by the fumes of party, and it seems to me as plain a proposition as any other, that we ought only to support such men and such measures as are for the good of the country, and the whole country. It seems to me, that no man enlists under the banner of a party without some sacrifice of integrity. My grandfather says to me, in his vulgar slang, `between two stools you will fall to the ground.' Be it so. It will be ground on which I can firmly plant my foot, and look up to heaven with a consciousness that I have not offended against that goodness that made me a citizen of a country destined to be the greatest and happiest the world ever saw, provided we are true to our political duties. Dearest Fanny, do not think I am haranguing and not feeling. God knows I have had a sore conflict; my heart has been wrung. You cover your face. Have I decided wrong?” “Oh, no, no;” she replied in a voice broken by her emotion. “For all the world, I would not that you should have decided otherwise. And yet, is it not very, very hard? I mean for you, Randolph. For myself, I have a pleasant home, and I am happy enough while I can see you every day, and be sure each day that we love one another better than we did the last. Besides;” she added, looking up with her sunny smile, “on some accounts, it is best as it is; it would almost break father's heart to part from me; and, as he says, dear Randolph, when the right time comes, `Providence will open a way for us.”' “Then, Fanny, you approve my decision?” “Approve it, Randolph! I do not seem proud, perhaps; but it would humble me to the very dust to have you think even of acting contrary to what you believe to be right. Oh, if we could only live in a world where it was all love and friendship and no politics!” Randolph smiled at the simplicity of Fanny's wish, and expressed, with all a lover's fervour, his admiration of the instinctive rectitude of her mind. He confessed that he had resolved and re-resolved his grandfather's proposition, in the hope that he might hit upon some mode of preserving his integrity and securing the bright reward offered him, but in vain. Our lovers must be forgiven if they protracted their walk long after the orthodox hour for barring a minister's doors. My friend, still the “spoiled child,” found her old sister Sally sitting up for her; and as they crept up to their rooms, “They say old maids are cross,” said Fanny, “but they don't know you who say so. You remember, sister, when you used to love to walk by moonlight, with a certain Mr. —?” “Whish, nonsense, Fanny,” said our “nun demure,” but she finished the ascent of the stairs with a lighter step, and as Fanny kissed her for good night, she saw that a slight blush had overspread her wan cheek at the pleasurable recollections called up. So true is woman to the instincts of her nature. On the next morning, Randolph was absent, and Mrs. Hunt said, in answer to his grandfather's inquiries, that he had ridden to the next village on business, and had left word that he should return in time for the election. The squire was excessively elated. He was on the point of obtaining a party triumph by the casting vote of his grandson; he should exhibit him for the first time in the democratic ranks, “enlisted for the war,” with the new blown honours of Hampden thick upon him. There are elevated points in every man's life, and this morning was the Chimborazo of the squire's. At the appointed hour the rival parties assembled at the meeting house; that being in most of our villages the only building large enough to contain the voters of the town, is, notwithstanding the temporary desecration, used as a political arena. There the rival parties met, as (with sorrow we confess it,) rival parties often meet in our republic, like the hostile forces of belligerent nations, as if they had no interest nor sentiment in common. The balloting began. Randolph had not arrived. The squire, though not yet distrustful, began to fidget. He had taken his station beside the ballot box; a station which, in spite of its violation of the courtesies if not the principle of voting by ballot, is often occupied by eager village politicians, for the purpose of peering into the box, and detecting any little artifice by which an individual may have endeavoured to conceal his vote. Here stood the squire, turning his eyes from the door where they eagerly glanced in quest of Randolph, to the box, and giving a smile or scowl to every vote that was dropped in. “What keeps the parson back?” thought he, knitting his grisled brows, as he looked at Doctor Atwood, “he is always the first to push forward.” This was true. The doctor's principles kindly coincided with his inclination in bringing him to the poll, but once having “put in his mite,” as he said, “into the good treasury,” he paid so much deference to his office, as immediately to withdraw from the battle-field. The doctor had controlling reasons for lingering on this occasion. Fanny had acquainted him with Randolph's determination. The old man was touched with his young favourite's virtue, and the more (we must forgive something to human infirmity,) that Randolph's casting vote would decide the election in favour of the federal party. The balloting was drawing to a close, and still Randolph did not appear. The doctor now fully participated the squire's uneasiness. He took off his spectacles, wiped them over and over again, and strained his eyes up the road by which Randolph was to return. “It is not like him to flinch,” thought the sturdy old man, “he is always up to the mark.” Still, as the delay was prolonged his anxiety increased. “Better have come boldly out on their side than sneak off in this fashion. I might have known that no one tainted with jacobinism could act an upright manly part. He writes well, to be sure; fine sentiments, but nothing so namby pamby as sentiment that is not backed up by conduct. Well, well; we are all in the hands of the Lord, and he may see fit yet to turn his heart; poor little Fanny; I'll throw in my vote and go home to her.” The doctor gave one last look through the window, and now, to his infinite joy, he descried Randolph approaching. In a few moments more he entered the church. His vote had been a matter much debated and of vital interest to both parties. As he entered, every eye turned towards him, and a general murmur ran round the church. “He'll vote for us!” and “he'll vote for us!” passed from mouth to mouth, and as usual the confident assertions were vouched by wagers. Whatever wrestlings with himself Randolph might have had in secret he was too manly to manifest his feelings to the public eye, and he walked up the aisle with his customary manner, revealing nothing by look or motion to the eager eyes of his observers; though there was enough to daunt or at least to fluster a man of common mettle, in the well known sound of the doctor's footsteps, shuffling after him, and in the aspect of the squire standing bolt upright before him; confidence and exultation seeming to elevate him a foot-above his ordinary stature. “Ha,” thought he, “every man has his price; bait your hook with a pretty girl, and you'll be sure to catch these boys.” At this critical moment, Randolph dropped in his vote. It was open, fairly exposed to the squire's eye, and it bore in legible, indubitable characters, the name of the Federal candidate. The doctor involuntarily grasped his hand, and whispered, “You have done your duty, my son, God bless you!” Words cannot describe either the squire's amazement or his wrath. Randolph had presumed too far when he hoped that the decency due to a public meeting would compel his relative to curb his passion, till reflection should abate it. It burst forth in incoherent imprecations, reproaches, and denunciations; and Randolph, finding that his presence only served to swell the storm, retreated. The votes were now counted, and notwithstanding Randolph's vote, and, contrary to all expectation, there proved to be a tie. Some federalist had been recreant. The balloting was repeated. Doctor Atwood had gone, and the democratic candidate was elected by a majority of one. This unexpected good fortune turned the tide of the squire's feelings. His individual chagrin was merged in the triumph of his party. They adjourned to the tavern to celebrate their victory in the usual mode of celebrating events, by eating and drinking. Excitement had its usual effects on our unethereal squire, and he indulged his stimulated appetite somewhat beyond the bounds of prudence. Even the tiger is said to be comparatively good natured on a full stomach. The squire's wrath was appeased by the same natural means; and when Hampden was toasted, he poured down a bumper, saying to his next neighbour as he did so, “I might have known that fellow with his nonsensical notions would have voted for the man he thought best of.” The conviviality of our politicians continued to a late hour. Libations were poured out to all the bright champions of their party. The moderns unfortunately swallow their libations. Finally, the squire proposed a parting glass to “the confusion and overthrow of all monarchists, aristocrats, federalists, or despots, by whatever name called,” and in the very act of raising it to his lips, he was seized with an apoplexy, which, in spite of his “sound grinders, full pulse, steady gait, and grandmother Brown having lived to ninety,” carried him off in the space of a few hours, leaving his whole estate, real and personal, to his legal and sole heir, Randolph Hayford. And how did Randolph bear this sudden reverse of fortune in his favour? This verification, as it truly seemed, of the doctor's prophecy, that “Providence would open up a way for them.” In the first place, he laid the axe to the root of the Hayford tree, renouncing at once and for ever the name, (of which he had so religiously performed the duties,) and resuming with pride and joy his honoured patronymic. He then, by a formal deed of quit calm, relinquished all right and title to the estate, real and personal, and goods and chattels of Silas Hayford, Esquire, in favour of Martha Hunt, said Silas's sister. Thus emancipated, and absolved from all further duties and obligations to the name of Hayford, with a character improved and almost perfected by the exact performance of self-denying and painful duties, he began his professional career, depending solely on his own talents and efforts; thank heaven, a sure dependence in our favoured country. My sweet friend, Fanny, who seemed to be the pet of destiny, as well as of father, sisters, and friends, was thus indulged in bearing the name of Gordon, to which she so fondly adhered. She was soon transferred to Randolph's new place of residence, and without breaking her old father's heart by a separation. He having rashly preached an ultra federal sermon on a fast day, that widened the breach between himself and the majority of his parish, so far, that it was impossible to close it without emulating the deed of Curtius. To this the good doctor had no mind, and just then most fortunately, (we beg his pardon, his own word is best,) “providentially” receiving a call to a vacant pulpit in the place of Randolph's residence, he once more transferred his home; spent his last days near his favourite child, and at last, in the language of scripture, “fell asleep” on her bosom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dear Randolph—I thank you a thousand times and so does C—, for the gold eagles. There never was anything in the world so beautiful, I do'nt believe. They are far before the grown up ladies. We shall certainly wear them to meeting next Sabbath, and fix them so every body in the world can see them, and not let the bow of ribbon fall down over them, as Miss Clarke did last Sabbath, cause she has got that old democrat, Doctor Star, for a sweetheart; but I managed her nicely, Randolph. In prayer time when she did not dare move, I whirled round the bow so the eagle stood up bravely, and flashed right in Doctor Star's eyes. I did not care so very much about having an eagle for myself, (though I do now since you have given it to me,) but I thought it very important for C— to wear the federal badge, because her father is a senator in Congress. Father is almost as pleased as we are. I see Clover coming and I must make haste; poor old fellow! I heard his tread when it stormed so awfully last night, and I got father to put him up in our stable. Was not he proper good? It was after prayers, too, and his wig was off and his knee buckles out. There, they all go out of Deacon Garfield's to read Clover's papers. Good by, dear, dear Randolph. F. A.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">E THE CATHOLIC IROQUOIS. A few years since a gentleman, on his way from Niagara to Montreal, arrived at Coteau du Lac. While the pilot, in conformity to the law, was obtaining a clearance for the lower province, the clouds, which had been all day threatening a storm, poured out their stores of thunder, lightning, and rain with such violence, that it was deemed most prudent to defer the conclusion of the voyage till the following day. The Boatmen's Inn was the only place of refuge, and the stranger was at first glad of a shelter within it. But he was an amateur traveller, and gentlemen of that fastidious class do not patiently submit to inconveniences. The inn was thronged with a motley crew of Scotch and Irish emigrants—Canadians—and boatmen, besides loiterers from the vicinity, who were just reviving from the revels of the preceding night. The windows were obscured with smoke, and the walls tapestered with cobwebs. The millenium of spiders and flies seemed to have arrived, for myriads of this defenceless tribe buzzed fearlessly around the banners of their natural enemy, as if, inspired by the kindliness of my uncle Toby, he had said, “poor fly this world is wide enough for thee and me.” The old garments and hats that had been substituted for broken panes of glass, were blown in, and the rain pattered on the floor. Some of the doors hung by one hinge—others had no latches; some of the chairs were without bottoms; and some without legs; —the bed-rooms were unswept; the beds unmade; and in short the whole establishment, as a celebrated field-preacher said of a very incommodious part of the other world, was “altogether inconvenient.” The traveller, in hopes of winning the hostess' good will, and thereby securing a clean pair of sheets, inquired his way to the kitchen, where he found her surrounded by some half dozen juvenile warriors in a state of open hostility, far more terrible than the war of the elements. Having succeeded by means of a liberal distribution of sugar-plumbs, in procuring a temporary suspension of arms, he introduced himself to his hostess by some civil inquiries, in answer to which he ascertained that she was a New England woman, though unfortunately she possessed none of those faculties for getting along, which are supposed to be the birthright of every Yankee. She did express a regret that her children were deprived of “school and meeting privileges,” and entertained something of a puritanical aversion to her Catholic neighbours; but save these relics of local taste or prejudice, she retained none of the peculiarities of her native land. The gentleman was not long in discovering that the unusual ingress of travellers reduced them all to the level of primitive equality, and that so far from the luxury of clean sheets, he must not hope for the exclusive possession of any. On further inquiry he learnt, that there was a French village at a short distance from the inn, and after waiting till the fury of the storm had abated, he sallied forth in quest of accommodation and adventure. He had not walked far, when his exploring eye fell on a creaking sign-board, on which was inscribed “Auberge et laugement.” But lodgment it would not afford to our unfortunate traveller. Every apartment—every nook and corner was occupied by an English party, on their way to the Falls. Politeness is an instinct in French nature, or if not an instinct, it is so interwoven in the texture of their character, that it remains, a fast colour, when all other original distinctions have faded. The Canadian peasant, though he retains nothing of the activity and ingenuity of his forefathers, salutes the stranger with an air of courtesy rarely seen in any other uneducated American. The landlord of the Auberge was an honourable exemplification of this remark. He politely told the stranger that he would conduct him to a farm house, where he might obtain a clean room and a nice bed. The offer was gratefully accepted, and our traveller soon found himself comfortably established in a neat white-washed cottage, in the midst of a peasant's family, who were engaged in common rural occupations. The wants of his body being thus provided for, he resorted to the usual expedients to enliven the hours that must intervene before bed-time. He inquired of the master of the house how he provided for his family, and after learning that he lived, as his father and grandfather had before him, by carrying the few products of his farm to Montreal, he turned to the matron, and asked her why her children were not taught English. “Ah!” she replied, “the English have done us too much wrong.” She then launched into a relation of her sufferings during the last war. She had, like honest Dogberry, “had her losses,” and found the usual consolation in recounting them. The militia officers had spoiled her of her flocks and herds, and des veaux—des moutons—des dindons—et des poulets, bled afresh in her sad tale. If her children were not taught English, one of them, the mother said, had been sent to a boarding-school at the distance of twenty miles, and she could now read like any priest. Little Marie was summoned, and she read with tolerable fluency from her school-book a collection of extracts from the fathers, while her simple parents sat bending over her with their mouths wide open, and their eyes sparkling and occasionally turning on the stranger with an expression of wonder and delight, as if they would have said, “did you ever see any thing equal to that?” The good-natured stranger listened and lavished his praises, and then, in the hope of escaping from any further display of the child's erudition, he offered to assist her elder sister, who was winding a skein of yarn—this proved a more amusing resource. The girl was pretty, and lively, and showed by the upward inclination of the corners of her arch mouth, and the flashes of her laughing eye, that she could understand the compliments, and return the raillery of her assistant. The pretty Louise had been living at the Seigniorie with madame, a rich widow—“si riche—si bonne,” she said, but “trop agee pour Monsieur, parce qu'elle a peut être trente ans; et d'ailleurs, elle n'est pas assez belle pour Monsieur.” Monsieur was a bachelor of forty years' standing, and his vanity was touched by Louise's adroit compliment. The skein slipped off his hands, Louise bent her head to arrange it, her fair round cheek was very near Monsieur's lips, perhaps her mother thought too near, for she called to Louise to lay aside her yarn and prepare the tea, and after tea the pretty girl disappeared. Our traveller yawned for an hour or two over the only book the house afforded, Marie's readings from St. Augustine and St. Chrysostom, and then begged to be shown to his bed. On entering his room, his attention was attracted to an antique, worm-eaten, travelling port-folio. It was made of morocco, and bound and clasped with silver, and, compared with the rude furniture of the humble apartment, it had quite an exotic air. He took it up, and looked at the initials on the clasp. “That is a curious affair,” said his landlord, “and older than either you or I.” “Some relic, I suppose,” said the stranger, “which you have inherited.” “Something in that way,” replied the landlord— E 2 “there is a big letter in it which has been like so much blank paper to us, for we have never had a scholar in the family that could read it. I have thought to take it some day to Pere Martigne at the Cedars, but I shall let it rest till next year when Marie—bless her! will be able to read writing.” The stranger said that if his landlord had no objection, he would try to read it. The old man's eyes glistened—he unclasped the port-folio, took out the manuscript, and put it into the stranger's hands. “You are heartily welcome,” he said, “it would at best be an uncouth task for Marie, for, as you see, the leaves are mouldy, and the ink has faded.” The stranger's zeal abated when he perceived the difficulty of the enterprise. “It is some old family record, I imagine,” he said, unfolding it with an air of indifference. “Heaven knows,” replied the landlord, “I only know that it is no record of my family. We have been but simple peasants from the beginning, and not a single line has been written about us, except what is on my grandfather's grave-stone at the Cedars—God bless him! I remember as well as if it were yesterday, his sitting in that old oaken chair by the casement, and telling us all about his travels to the great western lakes, with one Bouchard, a young Frenchman, who was sent out to our trading establishments —people did not go about the world then, as they do now-a-days, just to look at rapids and waterfalls.” “Then this,” said the stranger, in the hope of at last obtaining a clew to the manuscript, “this I presume is some account of the journey?” “Oh no,” replied the old man. “Bouchard found this on the shore of Lake Huron, in a strange wild place—sit down, and I will tell you all I have heard my grandfather say about it; bless the good old man, he loved to talk of his journey.” And so did his grandson, and the stranger listened patiently to the following particulars, which are only varied in language from the landlord's narration. It appeared that about the year 1700, young Bouchard and his attendants, on their return from Lake Superior, arrived on the shore of Lake Huron, near Saganaw Bay. From an eminence, they descried an Indian village, or to use their descriptive designation, a “smoke.” Bouchard despatched his attendants with Seguin, his Indian guide, to the village, to obtain canoes to transport them over the lake, and in the mean time he sought for some place that might afford him shelter and repose. The shore was rocky and precipitous. Practice and experience had rendered Bouchard as agile and courageous as a Swiss mountaineer, and he descended the precipice leaping from crag to crag as unconscious of an emotion of fear, as the wild bird that flapped her wings over him, and whose screeches alone broke the stillness of the solitude. Having attained the margin of the lake, he loitered along the water's edge, till turning an angle of a rock, he came to a spot which seemed to have been contrived by nature for a place of refuge. It was a little interval of ground in the form of an amphitheatre, nearly infolded by the rocks, which as they projected boldly into the lake at the extremities of the semicircle, looked as if their giant forms had been set there to defend this temple of nature. The ground was probably inundated after easterly winds, for it was soft and marshy, and among the rank weeds that covered it there were some aquatic flowers. The lake had once washed the base of the rocks here as elsewhere; they were worn perfectly smooth in some places, and in others broken and shelving. Bouchard was attracted by some gooseberries that had forced themselves through crevices in the rocks, and which seemed to form, with their purple berries and bright green leaves, a garland around the bald brow of the precipice. They are among the few indigenous fruits of the wilderness, and doubtless looked as tempting to Bouchard, as the most delicious fruits of the Hesperides would, in his own sunny valleys of France. In reconnoitring for the best mode of access to the fruit, he discovered a small cavity in the rock, that so much resembled a birth in a ship, as to appear to have been the joint work of nature and art. It had probably supplied the savage hunter or fisherman with a place of repose, for it was strewn with decayed leaves, so matted together as to form a luxurious couch for one accustomed for many months to sleeping on a blanket, spread on the bare ground. After possessing himself of the berries, Bouchard crept into the recess, and, (for there is companionship in water,) he forgot, for a while, the tangled forests, and the wide unbroken wilderness that interposed between him and his country. He listened to the soft musical sounds of the light waves, as they broke on the shelving rock and reedy bank; and he gazed on the bright element which reflected the blue vault of Heaven, and the fleecy summer cloud, till his senses became oblivious of this, their innocent and pure indulgence, and he sunk into a deep sleep, from which he was awakened by the dashing of oars. Bouchard looked out upon the lake, and saw, approaching the shore, a canoe in which were three Indians—a young man who rowed the canoe, an old man, and a maiden. They landed not far from him, and without observing him, turned towards the opposite extremity of the semicircle—the old man proceeded with a slow measured step, and removing a sort of door, formed of flexible brush-wood and matting, (which Bouchard had not before noticed,) they entered an excavation in the rocks—deposited something which they had brought in their hands—prostrated themselves for a few moments, and then slowly returned to the canoe; and as long as Bouchard could discern the bark, glancing like a water-fowl over the deep blue waters, he heard the sweet voice of the girl, accompanied at regular intervals by her companions hymning, as he fancied, some explanation of their mute worship, for their expressive gestures pointed first to the shore, and then to the skies. As soon as the canoe disappeared, Bouchard crept out of his birth and hastened to the cell. It proved to be a natural excavation, was high enough to admit a man of ordinary stature, and extended for several feet, when it contracted to a mere channel in the rocks. On one side, a little rivulet penetrated the arched roof, and fell in large crystal drops into a natural basin which it had worn in the rock. In the centre of the cell there was a pyramidal heap of stones—on the top of the pile lay a breviary and santanne; and on the sides of it were arranged the votive offerings Bouchard had seen deposited there. He was proceeding to examine them, when he heard the shrill signal whistle of his guide—he sounded his horn in reply, and in a few moments Sequin descended the precipice and was at his side. Bouchard told him what he had seen, and Sequin after a moment's reflection, said, “this must be the place of which I have so often heard our ancients speak—a good man died here. He was sent by the Great Spirit to teach our nation good things, and the Hurons yet keep many of his sayings in their hearts. They say he fasted all his life time, and he should feast now, so they bring him provisions from their festivals. Let us see—what offerings are these?” Sequin first took up a wreath of wild flowers, and evergreens interwoven—“this,” he said, “was a nuptial offering,” and he inferred that the young people were newly married. Next was a calumet—“this,” said Sequin, “is an emblem of peace—an old man's gift—and these,” he added, unrolling a skin that enveloped some ripe ears of Indian corn, “are the emblems of abundance, and the different occupations of the man and woman. The husband hunts the deer —the wife cultivates the maize, and those,” he concluded, pointing to some fresh scalps, and smiling at Bouchard's shuddering, “those are the emblems of victory.” Bouchard took up the breviary, and as he opened it, a manuscript dropped from between its leaves—he eagerly seized, and was proceeding to examine it, when his guide pointed to the lengthening shadows on the lake, and informed him that the canoes were to be ready at the rising of the full moon. Bouchard was a good Catholic, and like all good Catholics, a good Christian. He reverenced all the saints in the calendar, and he loved the memory of a good man, albeit never canonized. He crossed himself and repeated a paternoster, and then followed his guide to the place of rendezvous. The manuscript he kept as a holy relic, and that which fell into the hands of our traveller, at the cottage of the Canadian peasant, was a copy he had made to transmit to France. The original was written by Pere Mesnard, (whose blessed memory had consecrated the cell on Lake Huron,) and contained the following particulars. This holy man was educated at the seminary of St. Sulpice. The difficult and dangerous enterprise of propagating his religion among the savages of the western world appears early to have taken possession of his imagination, and to have inspired him with the ardour of an apostle, and the resolution of a martyr. He came to America under the auspices of Madame de Bouillon, who had, a few years before, founded the Hotel Dieu at Montreal. With her sanction and aid he established himself at a little village of the Utawas, on the borders of lake St. Louis, at the junction of the Utawa river and the St. Lawrence. His pious efforts won some of the savages to his religion, and to the habits of civilized life, and others he persuaded to bring their children to be trained in a yoke which they could not themselves bear. On one oceasion an Utawa chief appeared before Pere Mesnard with two girls whom he had captured from the Iroquois—a fierce and powerful nation, most jealous of the encroachment of the French, and resolute to exclude from their territory the emissaries of the Catholic religion. The Utawa chief presented the children to the father, saying “they are the daughters of my enemy—of Talasco, the mightiest chief of the Iroquois—the eagle of his tribe—he hates Christians —he calls them dogs—make his children Christians, and I shall be revenged.” This was the only revenge to which the good father would have been accessory. He adopted the girls in the name of the church and St. Joseph, to whom he dedicated them, intending that when they arrived at a suitable age to make voluntary vows they should enroll themselves with the religieuses of the Hotel Dieu. They were baptized by the Christian names of Rosalie and Françoise. They lived in Pere Mesnard's cabin, and were strictly trained to the prayers and penances of the church; Rosalie was a natural devotee—the father has recorded surprising instances of her voluntary mortifications. When only twelve years old, she walked on the ice around an island, three miles in circumference, on her bare feet—she strewed her bed with thorns, and seared her forehead with a red hot iron, that she might, as she said, bear the mark of the “slave of Jesus.” The father magnifies the piety of Rosalie with the exultation of a true son of the church, yet, as a man, he appears to have felt far more tenderness for Françoise, whom he never names without some epithet, expressive of affection or pity. If Rosalie was like the sunflower, that lives but to pay homage to a single object, Françoise resembled a luxuriant plant, that shoots out its flowers on every side, and imparts the sweetness of its perfume to every passer-by. Pere Mesnard says she could not pray all the time—she loved to rove in the woods—to sit gazing on the rapids, singing the wild native songs for which the Iroquois are so much celebrated—she shunned all intercourse with the Utawas, because they were the enemies of her people. Pere Mesnard complains that she often evaded her penances, but, he adds, she never failed in offices of kindness. On one occasion, when the father had gone to the Cedars on a religious errand, Françoise entered the cabin hastily—Rosalie was kneeling before a crucifix. She rose at her sister's entrance, and asked her with an air of rebuke, where she had been sauntering? Françoise said she had been to the Sycamores, to get some plants to dye the quills for Julie's wedding moccasins. “You think quite too much of weddings,” replied Rosalie, “for one whose thoughts should all be upon a heavenly marriage.” “I am not a nun yet,” said Françoise, “but oh! Rosalie, Rosalie, it was not of weddings I was thinking—as I came through the wood I heard voices whispering—our names were pronounced—not our Christian names, but those they called us by at Onnontague.” “You surely dared not stop to listen,” exclaimed her sister. “I could not help it, Rosalie—it was our mother's voice”—An approaching footstep at this moment startled both the girls. They looked out, and beheld their mother, Genanhatenna, close to them. Rosalie sunk down before the crucifix, Françoise sprang towards her mother in the ecstacy of youthful and natural joy. Genanhatenna, after looking silently at her children for a few moments, spoke to them with all the energy of strong and irrepressible feeling. She entreated, she commanded them to return with her to their own people. Rosalie was cold and silent, but Françoise laid her head on her mother's lap, and wept bitterly. Her resolution was shaken, till Genanhatenna arose to depart, and the moment of decision could not be deferred, she then pressed the cross that hung at her neck to her lips and said, “mother, I have made a Christian vow, and must not break it.” “Come with me then to the wood,” replied her mother, “if we must part, let it be there—come quickly—the young chief Allewemi awaits me—he has ventured his life to attend me here. If the Utawas see him their cowardly spirits will exult in a victory over a single man.” “Do not go,” whispered Rosalie, “you are not safe beyond the call of our cabins.” Françoise's feelings were in too excited a state to regard the caution, and she followed her mother. When they reached the wood Genanhatenna renewed her passionate entreaties. “Ah! Françoise,” she said, “they will shut you within stone walls, where you will never again breathe the fresh air—never hear the songs of birds, nor the dashing of waters. These Christian Utawas have slain your brothers—your father was the stateliest tree in in our forests, but his branches are all lopped, or withered, and if you return not, he perishes without a single scion from his stock. Alas! alas! I have borne sons and daughters, and I must die a childless mother.” Françoise's heart was touched—“I will—I will return with you, mother,” she said, “only promise me that my father will suffer me to be a Christian.” “That I cannot, Françoise,” replied Genanhatenna, “your father has sworn by the God Areouski,[3] [3] The God of War that no Christian shall live among the Iroquois.” “Then, mother,” said Françoise, summoning all her resolution, “we must part—I am signed with this holy sign,” she crossed herself, “and the daughter of Talasco should no longer waver.” “Is it so?” cried the mother, and starting back from Françoise's offered embrace, she clapped her hands and shrieked in a voice that rung through the wood, F the shriek was answered by a wild shout, and in a moment after Talasco and the young Allewemi rushed on them. “You are mine,” said Talasco, “in life and in death you are mine.” Resistance would have been vain. Françoise was placed between the two Indians, and hurried forward. As the party issued from the wood, they were met by a company of Frenchmen, armed, and commanded by a young officer eager for adventure. He perceived at a glance Françoise's European dress—knew she must be a captive, and determined to rescue her. He levelled his musket at Talasco, Françoise sprang before her father, and shielded him with her own person, while she explained in French that he was her father. “Rescue me,” she said, “but spare him—do not detain him—the Utawas are his deadly foes—they will torture him to death, and I, his unhappy child, shall be the cause of all his misery.” Talasco said nothing. He had braced himself to the issue, whatever it might be, with savage fortitude. He disdained to sue for a life which it would have been his pride to resign without shuddering, and when the Frenchmen filed off to the right and left, and permitted him to pass, he moved forward without one look or word that indicated he was receiving a favour at their hands. His wife followed him. “Mother— one parting word,” said Françoise, in a voice of tender appeal. “One word,” echoed Genanhatenna, pausing for an instant, “Yes, one word—Vengeance. The day of your father's vengeance will come—I have heard the promise in the murmuring stream and in the rushing wind—it will come.” Françoise bowed her head as if she had been smitten, grasped her rosary, and invoked her patron saint. The young officer, after a moment's respectful silence, asked whither he should conduct her? “To Pere Mesnard's”—she said. “Pere Mesnard's,” reiterated the officer. “Pere Mesnard is my mother's brother, and I was on my way to him when I was so fortunate as to meet you.” The officer's name was Eugene Brunon. He remained for some days at St. Louis. Rosalie was engrossed in severe religious duties, preparatory to her removal to the convent. She did not see the strangers, and she complained that Françoise no longer participated her devotions. Françoise pleaded that her time was occupied with arranging the hospitalities of their scanty household; but when she was released from this duty by the departure of Eugene, her spiritual taste did not revive. Eugene returned successful from the expedition, on which he had been sent by the government; then, for the first time, did Pere Mesnard perceive some token of danger, that St. Joseph would lose his votary; and when he reminded Fran çoise that he had dedicated her to a religious life, she frankly confessed that she and Eugene had reciprocally plighted their faith. The good Father reproved and remonstrated—and represented in the strongest colours, “the sin of taking the heart from the altar, and devoting it to an earthly love,”—but Françoise answered that she could not be bound by vows she had not herself made. “Oh! Father,” she said, “let Rosalie be a nun and a saint—I can serve God in some other way.” “And you may be called to do so in a way, my child,” replied the Father with solemnity, “that you think not of.” “And if I am,” said Françoise smiling, “I doubt not, good Father, that I shall feel the virtue of all your prayers and labours in my behalf.” This was the sportive reply of a light, unapprehensive heart, but it sunk deeply into the Father's mind, and was indelibly fixed there by subsequent circumstances. A year passed on—Rosalie was numbered with the black nuns of the Hotel Dieu. Eugene paid frequent visits to St. Louis, and Pere Mesnard finding further opposition useless, himself administered the holy sacrament of marriage. Here the Father pauses in his narrative, to eulogize the union of pure and loving hearts, and pronounces that, next to a religious consecration, this is most acceptable to God. The wearisome winter of Canada was past—summer had come forth in her vigour, and clothed with her fresh green the woods and valleys of St. Louis; the full Utawa had had thrown off its icy mantle, and proclaimed its freedom in a voice of gladness. Pere Mesnard had been, according to his daily custom, to visit the huts of his little flock. He stopped before the crucifix which he had caused to be erected in the centre of the village—he looked about upon the fields prepared for summer crops—upon the fruit trees gay with “herald blossoms,” he saw the women and children busily at work in their little garden patches, and he raised his heart in devout thankfulness to God, who had permitted him to be the instrument of redeeming these poor savages from a suffering life. He cast his eye on the holy symbol before which he knelt, and saw, or fancied he saw, a shadow flit over it. He thought it was a passing cloud, but when he looked upward, he perceived the sky was cloudless, and then he knew full well it was a presage of coming evil. But when he entered his own cabin, the sight of Françoise dispelled his gloomy presentiments. “Her face,” he says, “was as bright and clear as the lake, when not a breath of wind was sweeping across it, and the clear sun shone upon it.” She had, with her simple skill, been ornamenting a scarf for Eugene. She held it up to Pere Mesnard as he entered. “See, Father,” she said, “I have finished it, and I trust Eugene will never have a wound to soil it. Hark!” she added, “he will be here presently, I hear the chorus of his French boatmen swelling on the air.” The good Father would have said, “you think too much of Eugene, my child,” but he could not bear to check the full tide of her youthful happiness, and he only said with a smile, “when your bridal moon is in the wane, Françoise, I shall expect you to return to penances and prayers.” She did not heed him, for at that instant she caught a glimpse of her husband, and bounded away, fleet as a startled deer, to meet him. Pere Mesnard observed them as they drew near the cabin. Eugene's brow was contracted, and though it relaxed for a moment at the fond caresses of Françoise, it was evident from his hurried step and disturbed mien, that he feared some misfortune. He suffered Françoise to pass in before him, and unobserved by her, beckoned to Pere Mesnard. “Father,” he said, “there is danger near. An Iroquois captive was brought into Montreal yesterday, who confessed that some of his tribe were out on a secret expedition; I saw strange canoes moored in the cove at Cedar Island—you must instantly return with Françoise in my boat to Montreal.” “What!” exclaimed the Father, “think you that I will desert my poor lambs at the moment the wolves are upon them!” “You cannot protect them, Father,” replied Eugene. “Then I will die with them.” “Nay, Father,” urged Eugene, “be not so rash. Go—if not for your own sake, for my poor Françoise —what will become of her if we are slain?—The Iroquois have sworn vengeance on her, and they are fierce and relentless as tigers. Go, I beseech you— every moment is winged with death. The boatmen are ordered to await you at Grassy Point. Take your way through the maple wood—I will tell Françoise that Rosalie has sent for her—that I will join her to-morrow—any thing to hasten your departure.” “Oh, my son—I cannot go—the true Shepherd will not leave his sheep.” F 2 The good Father continued inexorable, and the only alternative was to acquaint Françoise, and persuade her to depart alone. She positively refused to go without her husband. Eugene represented to her that he should be for ever disgraced if he deserted a settlement under the protection of his government, at the moment of peril.—“My life, Françoise,” he said, “I would lay down for you—but my honour is a trust for you—for my country—I must not part with it.” He changed his intreaties into commands. “Oh, do not be angry with me,” said Françoise; “I will go, but I do not fear to die here with you,” She had scarcely uttered these words when loud yells were heard—“It is my father's war-whoop,” she cried —“St. Joseph aid us!—we are lost.” “Fly—fly, Françoise,” exclaimed Eugene—“To the maple wood, before you are seen.” Poor Françoise, threw her arms around her husband —clung to him in one long, heart-breaking embrace, and then ran towards the wood. The terrible war-cry followed, and there mingled with it, as if shrilly whispered in her ear, “Vengeance—the day of your father's vengeance will come.” She attained the wood, and mounted a sheltered eminence, from which she could look back upon the green valley. She stopped for an instant. The Iroquois canoes had shot out of the island cove, and were darting towards St. Louis, like vultures eager for their prey. The Utawas rushed from their huts, some armed with muskets, others simply with bows and arrows. Pere Mesnard walked with a slow but assured step towards the crucifix, and having reached it, he knelt, seemingly insensible to the gathering storm, and as calm as at his usual vesper prayer. “Ah,” thought Françoise, “the first arrow will drink his lifeblood.”—Eugene was every where at the same instant —urging some forward, and repressing others; and in a few moments all were marshalled in battle array around the crucifix. The Iroquois had landed. Françoise forgot now her promise to her husband, forgot every thing in her intense interest in the issue of the contest. She saw Pere Mesnard advance in front of his little host, and make a signal to Talasco. “Ah, holy Father,” she exclaimed, “thou knowest not the eagle of his tribe— thou speakest words of peace to the whirlwind.” Talasco drew his bow—Françoise sunk on her knees, “God of mercy shield him,” she cried. Pere Mesnard fell pierced by the arrow—the Utawas were panic struck. In vain Eugene urged them forward— in vain he commanded them to discharge their muskets. All with the exception of five men turned and fled. Eugene seemed determined to sell his life as dearly as possible. The savages rushed on him and his brave companions with their knives and tomahawks. “He must die!” exclaimed Françoise; and instinctively she rushed from her concealment. A yell of triumph apprized her that her father's band descried her—she faltered not—she saw her husband pressed on every side. “Oh, spare him—spare him!” she screamed—“he is not your enemy.” Her father darted a look at her—“A Frenchman!—a Christian!” he exclaimed, “and not my enemy,” and turned again to his work of death. Françoise rushed into the thickest of the fray—Eugene uttered a faint scream at the sight of her. He had fought like a blood hound while he believed he was redeeming moments for her flight; but when the hope of saving her forsook him, his arms dropped nerveless, and he fell to the ground. Françoise sunk down beside him—she locked her arms around him, and laid her cheek to his. For one moment her savage foes fell back, and gazed on her in silence—there was a chord in their natures that vibrated to a devotedness which triumphed over the fear of death; but their fierce passions were suspended only for a moment. Talasco raised his tomahawk— “Do not strike, father,” said Françoise, in a faint calm voice, “he is dead.” “Then let him bear the death-scar,” replied the unrelenting savage, and with one stroke he clove her husband's head asunder. One long loud shriek pealed on the air, and Françoise sunk into as utter unconsciousness as the mangled form she clasped. The work of destruction went on—the huts of the Utawas were burned, and women and children perished in one indiscriminate slaughter. The Father relates that he was passed, wounded, and disregarded, in the fury of the assault—that he remained in a state of insensibility till midnight, when he found himself lying by the crucifix with a cup of water, and an Indian cake beside him. He seems at a loss whether to impute this succour to his saint, or to some compassionate Iroquois. He languished for a long time in a state of extreme debility, and when he recovered, finding every trace of cultivation obliterated from St. Louis, and the Utawas disposed to impute their defeat to the enervating effect of his peaceful doctrines—he determined to penetrate further into the wilderness; faithfully to sow the good seed, and to leave the harvest to the Lord of the field. In his pilgrimage he met with a Utawas girl who had been taken from St. Louis with Françoise, and who related to him all that happened to his beloved disciple after her departure, till she arrived at Onnontagué, the chief village of the Iroquois. For some days she remained in a state of torpor, and was borne on the shoulders of the Indians. Her father never spoke to her—never approached her, but he permitted Allewemi to render her every kindness. It was manifest that he intended to give his daughter to this young chieftain. When they arrived at Onnontagué, the tribe came out to meet them, apparelled in their garments of victory, consisting of beautiful skins and mantles of feathers, of the most brilliant colours. They all saluted Françoise, but she was as one deaf, and dumb, and blind. They sung their songs of greeting and of triumph, and the deep voice of the old chief Talasco swelled the chorus. Françoise's step did not falter nor her cheek blench; her eyes were cast down, and her features had the fixedness of death. Once, indeed, when she passed her mother's hut, some tender recollection of her childhood seemed to move her spirit, for tears were seen to steal from beneath her eye-lids. The wild procession moved on to the green, a place appropriated in every Indian village to councils and sports. The Indians formed a circle around an oak tree—the ancients were seated—the young men stood respectfully without the circle. Talasco arose, and drawing from his bosom a roll, he cut a cord that bound it, and threw it on the ground—“Brothers and sons,” he said, “behold the scalps of the Christian Utawas!—their bodies are mouldering on the sands of St. Louis—thus perish all the enemies of the Iroquois. Brothers, behold my child—the last of the house of Talasco. I have uprooted her from the strange soil where our enemies had planted her; she shall be reset in the warmest valley of the Iroquois, if she marries the young chief Allewemi and abjures that sign,” and he touched with the point of his knife the crucifix that hung at Françoise's neck. He paused for a moment, Françoise did not raise her eyes, and he added, in a voice of thunder, “Hear me, child, if thou dost not again link thyself in the chain of thy people—if thou dost not abjure that badge of thy slavery to the Christian dogs, I will sacrifice thee—as I swore before I went forth to battle, I will sacrifice thee to the God Areouski—life and death are before thee—speak.” Françoise calmly arose, and sinking on her knees, she raised her eyes to Heaven, pressed the crucifix to her lips, and made the sign of the cross on her forehead. Talasco's giant frame shook while he looked at her—for one brief moment the flood of natural affection rolled over his fierce passions, and he uttered a piercing cry as if a life-cord were severed, but after one moment of agony, the sight of which made the old men's heads to shake, and young eyes to overflow with tears, he brandished his knife, and commanded the youths to prepare the funeral pile. A murmur arose among the old men. “Nay, Talasco,” said one of them, “the tender sapling should not be so hastily condemned to the fire. Wait till the morning's sun—suffer thy child to be conducted to Genanhatenna's hut—the call of the mother bird may bring the wanderer back to the nest.” Françoise turned impetuously towards her father, and clasping her hands, she exclaimed, “Oh do not—do not send me to my mother—this only mercy I ask of you—I can bear any other torture—pierce me with those knives on which the blood of my husband is scarcely dry—consume me with your fires—I will not shrink from any torment—a Christian martyr can endure as firmly as the proudest captive of your tribe.” “Ha!” exclaimed the old man, exultingly, “the pure blood of the Iroquois runs in her veins—prepare the pile—the shadows of this night shall cover her ashes.” While the young men were obeying the command, Françoise beckoned to Allewemi. “You are a chieftain,” she said, “and have power—release that poor Utawas child from her captivity—send her to my sister Rosalie, and let her say to her, that if an earthly love once came between me and Heaven, the sin is expiated—I have suffered more in a few hours—in a few moments, than all her sisterhood can suffer by long lives of penance. Let her say that in my extremity I denied not the cross, but died courageously.” Allewemi promised all she asked, and faithfully performed his promise. A child of faith—a martyr does not perish without the ministry of celestial spirits. The expression of despair vanished from Françoise's face. A supernatu ral joy beamed from her eyes, which were cast upward—her spirit seemed eager to spring from its prison-house—she mounted the pile most cheerfully, and standing erect and undaunted, “Happy am I,” she exclaimed, “thus permitted to die in my own country, and by the hand of my kindred, after the example of my Saviour, who was nailed to the cross by his own people.” She then pressed the crucifix to her lips, and signed to her executioners to put fire to the pile. They stood motionless with the fire-brands in their hands—Françoise appeared to be a voluntary sacrifice, not a victim. Her father was maddened by her victorious constancy. He leaped upon the pile, and tearing the crucifix from her hands, he drew his knife from his girdle, and made an incision on her breast in the form of a cross—“Behold!” he said, “the sign, thou lovest—the sign of thy league with thy father's enemies—the sign that made thee deaf to the voice of thy kindred.” “Thank thee, my father!” replied Françoise, with a triumphant smile; “I might have lost the cross thou hast taken from me, but this which thou hast given me, I shall bear even after death.”[4] [4] This circumstance in the martyrdom of an Indian girl, is related by Charlevoix. The pile was fired—the flames curled upwards; and the Iroquois Martyr perished.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE COUNTRY COUSIN. He is a man, and men Have imperfections; it behooves Me pardon nature then. The Patient Countess. L'homme honore la vertu, Dieu la recompense. The dark empire of superstition has passed away. This is the age of facts and evidence, experience and demonstration, the enlightened age, par excellence. Ghosts, apparitions, banshees, phocas, cluricaunes, fairies, “good people all,” are now departed spirits. The fairies, the friends of poets and story-tellers, the patrons, champions, and good geniuses of children, no longer keep their merry revels on the green sward by the glow-worm's lamp; they are gone, exhaled like the dews that glittered on last summer's leaves. The “dainty spirits” that knew “to swim, to dive into the fire, to ride on the curled clouds, to put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes,” have no longer a being save in poetry. Like the Peri of the Persian mythology, they forfeit their immortality when they pass the bounds of their paradise—that paradise the poet's imagination. Though in the full meridian of our “enlightened day,” we look back with something like regret to the imaginative era of darkness, when spirits, embodied in every form that fear or fancy could invent, thronged the paths of human life, broke its monotony, and coloured its dull surface with the bright hues and deep shadows of magic light. We almost envy the twilight of our Indian predecessors, whose quickening faith, like the ancient philosophy, infused vitality into external nature, imparting a portion of the Infinite Spirit to mountain, valley, stream, and flower, that faith that gave discourse and reason to trees, and stones, and running brooks. Strange that in the progress of light, mind should surrender its dominion to matter! that the metaphysics of nature should yield to the physical sciences! that the materialism of the mineralogist, the botanist, the geologist, should prevail over the spirituality of the savage! But so it is. The suggestions of superstition so universal in man's natural state of ignorance, are silenced by the clear, cold demonstrations of knowledge. Who now ventures to tell a fairy tale beyond the purlieus of the nursery? Who would hope to raise a ghost above the subterranean region of the kitchen? The murdered lie as quietly in their graves as if they had been dismissed to their rest anointed and annealed; and even Love's martyrs, the most persevering of all night-walkers, no more revisit the glimpses of the moon. And yet there seems to be a deep foundation in nature for a belief in mysterious visitations, in our unknown and incomprehensible connexion with spiritual beings. The mighty mind of Johnson was duped by the ghost of Cocklane, and seized, as he himself confesses, on every tale of the reappearance of the dead to support his religious faith! What are we to infer from the horoscope of the hero of “Guy Mannering,” what from the “Lady of Avenel,” and all the strange prophecies fulfilled of Sir Walter Scott, but that the wild and fantastic superstitions of his native land, that “meet nurse of a poetic child,” still control his imagination. Even Napoleon, who feared no power embodied in flesh and blood, bowed like an Oriental slave before the dark, mysterious despot Destiny. We have made this long introduction to a ghost story it was once our good fortune to hear well told, to G persuade our readers that we have drunk deep enough of the spirit of the age to laugh, when we are in the presence of the honoured public, at the superstition and credulity of others, though we may still cherish some relic of it in our secret soul. Somewhere between twenty and thirty years ago— there is, alas! a period when accurate dates become a sort of memento mori—we, or rather I—for, like a late popular writer, we detest that reviewer in the abstract, the “cold, and critical,” and pompous we— I was on a visit to a friend of my parents who resided in New York, Mrs. Reginald Tudor. She was an Englishwoman by birth, but had long been a resident in this country, and, though of a noble family, and educated with aristocratic prejudices, she was, in all acts of kindness, condescension, and humanity, a Christian; and is not Christianity the foundation, the essence of republicanism? Her instincts were aristocratic, or those principles of conduct that are so early inculcated and acted on that they become as impulsive and powerful as instincts; but when a deed of kindness was to be done, she obeyed the levelling law of the religion of universal equality. As Mrs. Reginald Tudor, the lady of polite society, she was versed and strict in all artificial distinctions and nice observances; but as a Christian, friend, and benefactress, no fiery revolutionist ever so well illustrated the generous doctrine of equality; for hers was the perfect standard of rectitude, and every one who needed the tender charities of life from her, was her “brother and her sister.” Forgive her then, gentle reader, a slight contempt of republican manners, and a little pride in her titled ancestry and noble English relatives. Like most old people, Mrs. Tudor talked always of the past, and the friends of her youth. Her grandfather, whose pet she had been sixty years since, was her favourite topic. Her stories began with “My dear grandfather, Lord Moreland”—“Lord Moreland” was the invariable sequence. But this was an innocent vanity, and should not cast a shade over my honoured friend's memory. The only evil attending this foible, so ill adapted to our country, was that it had infected her grandaughter, my friend Isabel Williamson. Isabel, at the period of which I write, was, a beautiful girl of eighteen, an only child, and as such cherished and caressed, but not spoiled by her parents and grandmother. Nothing could spoil so frank and generous a disposition, so noble-minded a creature. But Isabel was touched with the family taint of pride. She had a feeling very closely bordering on contempt for every thing American, and, though born in the city of New York, though her mother and her maternal ancestors were American, she always called herself English, preferred all English usages, however ill suited to our state of society, had some pretty affectations of Anglican phraseology, imported her dresses, hats, shoes, from England, employed English teachers, and preferred English men and admirers. At the time I was with her, her parents were away from home on a long absence, and during my visit her cousin Lucy Atwell arrived in town from “the West.” “The West,” a designation that has removed with our emigrants to Missouri, then meant one of the middle district counties of the state of New York. Lucy came, consigned for life, to Isabel's parents. She was a meek, timid, country girl, of about seventeen, made an orphan by sudden bereavement, and by an accumulation of misfortunes left pennyless. This was an irresistible appeal to Isabel's heart. “Grandmamma,” she said to Mrs. Tudor, “we must provide for poor Lucy.” “Certainly, Isabel, I was sure you would say so.” “I have been thinking,” resumed Isabel, “that Mrs. Arnott's would be such a good place for Lucy to board.” “My dear Isabel, we must keep her with us.” “Grandmamma!” “Why not, my child?” Isabel well knew the “why not,” operative on her mind, but she did not care to tell it, and she offered the most plausible reason that occurred to her. “You know, Ma'am, it must be so unpleasant for a person to live as a dependent in the family of relatives.” “That depends, Isabel, on the tempers of the parties. If you are not wanting in kindness and consideration, I am sure, from little Lucy's sweet face, she will not fail in gratitude and contentment; at any rate she must stay with us.” “Do you not think,” said Isabel to me when we were alone together, “that grandmamma is getting childish? She was so decided, so obstinate to-day, about Lucy.” The following day I perceived that Isabel suffered a series of mortifications on her cousin's account. In the first place nothing could be more decidedly countryfied, not to say vulgar, for I cannot bear to apply that word even for once to one so pretty, gentle, and essentially refined as Lucy—nothing could be more countryfied, more ill made, and unbecoming than our little rustic's dress. The date of our story was long before the artful looms of Europe had prepared every variety of texture, and brought the light silk and delicate barege level to the means of the most humble purchaser. It was the age of cotton cambrics, and bombazettes, and our country cousin was dressed in a stiff, glazed, black cotton cambric, with a vandyke of the same, a crimped leno frill, and white knit yarn stockings. It was then the fashion to dress the hair low, with braids and bands after the classic models; Lucy's was drawn up like a tower on the top of her head, and walled in by a horn comb. Isabel spent too much money, time, and thought on her dress not to pride herself on its style, and never was there a more striking contrast than the two cousins presented, when they were both seated together in the parlour. Isabel, arrayed in high fashion and taste, with her toy work-basket filled with the elegant implements of “idlesse” work, and Lucy, in the costume we have described, diligently knitting a full sized, substantial cotton stocking. But in spite of this homely vulgarity, there was something of nature's aristocracy in her graceful and delicate outline, in her “serious eye,” and thoughtful, fair young brow, and I felt hurt and mortified for my dear friend Isabel, when I perceived a little flutter and fidgetiness about her at every rap at the street door, indicating too plainly her dread of having her cousin seen by her fashionable acquaintance. Isabel was not sufficiently a woman of the world, and she had too much good feeling to desembarrass herself of this concern, as a true woman of ton does, by the current jokes on country cousins. It was a day of trial to Isabel. The heavens were serene, the air balmy, and the walking fine; and it seemed as if all our acquaintances, and especially those who for very delicateness were afraid of the rough visitation of the winds, had selected this day to pour in upon us. Mrs. Tudor was at her usual station on a corner of the sofa, and, punctilious in the formal politeness of the day, she most precisely introduced every visiter to “Miss Lucy Atwell—Miss Williamson's niece; and each time, Lucy, according to her notion of good manners, laid aside her knitting-work, rose and dropped her little dot of a courtesy; and, though Isabel affected to laugh and talk in her usual careless style, I could perceive in her face, as in a mirror, her consciousness of poor Lucy's every word and motion. Isabel's Anglo-mania had led her to avoid every Americanism, word or phrase; and the “concludes,” “calculates,” and “guesses,” which were in all poor Lucy's replies to the few questions addressed to her, grated on her cousin's ear. It is difficult to recall, after time and matured sense has released us from the galling fetters that are imposed by the false notions and G 2 artificial distinctions of fashionable society, it is difficult to recall the feelings that, like the emotions of a troubled dream, were then as real to us, as they now are illusory and ridiculous. It now seems to me incredible that my friend Isabel, the noble woman whom I have since seen wrestling with fearful calamities, and enduring calmly and sweetly the darkest night of adversity, should at eighteen have wasted tears, and a flood of them, on the mortifications I have recorded. But so it was. They were, however, shed in private, and known only to myself and to her grandmother, with whom she again expostulated on the subject of Lucy's removal to some other home. Mrs. Tudor was mild, but firm in her first decision. In the evening, at the usual hour for retiring, the good old lady invited us to her apartment. This was her frequent custom, and a great pleasure to us, for there is always somethink in the sociality of one's own room, far more unbending, intimate, and endearing, than in the parlour intercourse. Mrs. Tudor left her stateliness, her only infirmity, below stairs, and in her own apartment was the true grandmother, easy, communicative, and loving. It was late, I believe near the witching time of night, when we, Isabel, Lucy, and myself, drew our low chairs around Mrs. Tudor's matronly rocking-chair. The oil in the lamp was expended, a stick of wood was burning, as all wood burns after twelve o'clock, fitfully, and the bright, changeful flame threw such strange distorted figures on the wall, that braver spirits than ours might have been frightened at a shadow. Our conversation turned, I don't know how, but it then seemed naturally enough, on ghost stories. Mrs. Tudor was the benefactress of the rising generation; her mind was stored with strange and forgotten events; she had treasures of marvellous appearances, which had no record but in her memory. After relating various anecdotes till we were all in a state of considerable excitement, till Isabel had forgotten her coldness, and Lucy her timidity, Mrs. Tudor said; “There is one ghost story that I have never told, not even to you, Isabel, for whose insatiable curiosity I have produced every other treasure from my storehouse. This is connected with many sacred recollections, it deeply affected my imagination at the time, and related to persons in whom I had some interest. There are many preliminary circumstances before I can come at the supernatural incident—it is late—shall I tell it to-night?” “Oh yes!” was the unanimous voice, and Mrs. Tudor proceeded. “When I lived in London, I had an intimate friend who was, like myself, a widow, with an only son. Mrs. M`Arthur—that was her name—had set her heart on having her son fix himself in the calm quiet of home and domestic life, such as suited her matured and feminine tastes, but was not at all adapted to a young man of unchecked ambition and ardent passions. M`Arthur's mind was early steeped in the military spirit of tales and songs of chivalry, and as soon as he was old enough to think of a profession, he avowed his will—the will, and the wish of a widow's only son is fate—to be a soldier. My friend opposed him at first, but he who was never denied anything, was not long opposed in his most impetuous passion, and his poor mother, fearing all things and hoping nothing, procured a captaincy for him, and soon after had her heart almost broken by his being ordered on the American service. Your father, Isabel, came to this country at the same time, and was ever after intimately associated with M`Arthur, and from him I have received the particulars that I shall relate to you. “Captain M`Arthur was appointed to command a detachment that was sent to wrest the possession of a small town from the Americans. The male inhabitants, notwithstanding the confusion of a surprise, made a valorous resistance, but, overcome by numbers and discipline, all who could fly, fled to support the banner of their country in a more fortunate field, and defend her where defence would be available.” “Ah!” said Isabel, whose partialities were always in the English ranks, “the Yankees often practised that better part of valour—discretion.” “Not till its bolder part was useless,” retorted the gentle Lucy. “The fray is past, fair champions,” said I, “do not interrupt the story.” “No, girls,” continued Mrs. Tudor, “my story has little to do with the war, though a good deal with the passions it engendered. Captain M`Arthur had gallantly achieved his object. He obtained undisputed possession of the town, but in effecting this, he received a dangerous wound, and was carried bleeding and insensible to the best house the place afforded, situate at the entrance of the town, and belonging to one Amos Blunt, a bold yeoman, who had been first and last to fight in defence of his home, and who, as he caught from a distant hill a last look of the roof that sheltered his two lovely and now defenceless daughters, swore eternal hatred to the English. Fatally and cruelly did he keep his vow. “To return to M`Arthur. The sad chances of the battle had made his life to depend on those very daughters of the yeoman, Emma and Anna Blunt. Unskilful surgical treatment aggravated his wound; a violent fever ensued, and for many weeks the gay and gallant young officer was as dependent as an infant on the tender vigilance of his pretty nurses. “The two sisters, as I have heard, were alike in nothing but their devoted affection to each other; even their looks were as dissimilar as distinct races, as unlike, Isabel, as you and your cousin Lucy. You might, indeed, if I remember their pictures accurately, stand for their living portraits, so fair, so like a snow-drop, or rather so like that meek representative of all spiritual purity and womanly tenderness, the Madonna, so like my sweet Lucy was Emma—yes, just so sensitive and blushing at her own praises, even from the lips of an old woman; and my dear Isabel—but you cannot so well bear flattery. It is enough to say that Anna had a brow of lofty daring, a quick, glancing, laughter-loving eye, a rich damask on her cheek that expressed the kindling and burning of her feelings; lips that a Grecian artist would have chiselled to utter the laws of love, rather than its prayers; in short, a face and shape that a painter would have chosen for a Semiramis, or Zenobia, or Clotilda.” “Grandmamma!” exclaimed Isabel, “are you describing two daughters of a farmer?” “Even so, Isabel; and truly you must remember, my dear,” what Isabel was prone to forget, “nature has no aristocratic moulds; the peasant is born with as fine limbs and beautiful features as his lord. Besides, you must know, these girls had not impaired their natural beauty by household drudgery. Their father was wealthy; they were his only children, and motherless from extreme childhood, their stern father, stern to everything but them, had lavished his wealth to procure for them whatever advantages of education the country then afforded. “You must allow, that when the romantic M`Arthur awoke from his long delirium, and beheld these beautiful forms flitting around his pillow, he was in more danger than he had been from their father's sword. In the flush of health and unbroken spirits, Anna would have been most attractive to him; but in the gentleness, the patient watchings, the soft, low toned voice, the uniform tranquillity of Emma, there was something so suited to the nurse and leech, so adapted to the abated spirit of the invalid, that his susceptible heart was touched, and, in the progress of a slow convalescence, entirely captivated, and honestly surrendered. “It was not in human nature, certainly not in Emma's tender nature, to resist the fondness of the most interesting man she had ever seen. She requited it, with a strength and depth of devotion, that, I believe, my dear girls, men seldom, if ever, feel. “The rash, impetuous lover proposed an immediate marriage. His intentions were strictly honourable; for Emma's sake he was willing to forget his noble birth, the wishes of his far-off, widowed, but, alas! proud mother, the duties of his official station, propriety, expediency, the world, for love. But Emma was of another temper. She could have surrendered every other happiness in life to be M`Arthur's wife, she could have died for him, but she would not deviate one point from the straight line of filial duty. She would not hear M`Arthur's vows, acknowledge him as a lover, nor think of him as a husband, till she had her father's sanction. This was strange to the indulged youth, who had never regarded any sanction but that of his own inclinations; he felt himself thwarted by her determination, and half offended by the absolute necessity of waiting till the consent of her father could be obtained. However, there was no alternative. He addressd an earnest letter to Amos Blunt; Emma added a modest, but decided, postscript; and a trusty American boy was hired to convey it a distance of little less than a hundred miles, where Blunt was stationed. In the then condition of the country, this was a long and uncertain journey, and during the weary weeks of waiting, M`Arthur lost all patience. In this tedious interim the fearful Emma truly anticipated the result of their appeal to her father, and, with maidenly modesty withdrew herself from every demonstration of her lover's tenderness. He called this preciseness and coldness, and his pride, even more than his love, was offended. “While Emma with the resolution of a martyr, secluded herself in her own apartment, M`Arthur, still confined to the house, was limited to the society of Anna. The vigour of his spirit returned with his improving health, and then he found that her gay and reckless spirit harmonized far better with his natural temper, than the timid disposition of her sister. “Anna's beauty was more brilliant, her conversation more lively and taking, and—have I prepared you for it, my dear girls?—when the parental fiat arrived, the peremptory, unchangeable, no, it was received by him with indifference, I am afraid with a secret satisfaction. Poor Emma! the cold, precise Emma, fainted in her sister's arms; and for many successive days she seemed hovering between life and death. To disobey, or evade, or attempt to soften her father's will, was to her impossible; but to endure it, appeared equally impossible. She must suffer, might die, but would submit. “At first she dreaded the remonstrances of her lover, then she expected them, and expressed this expectation to Anna, first in broken sentences and then in more significant looks; but Anna made no reply to her words or questioning glances. She loved Emma better than anything but—M`Arthur. She hung over her with devoted tenderness, and, I doubt not, with a self-reproach she could not stifle. “By slow degrees Emma recovered her self-control, and, armed with all the fortitude she could gather or assume, she prepared to meet her lover's gaze—that gaze was altered, the lover her lover no longer. How sure and rapid is the intelligence of true affection! A short, slight observation proved to her that M`Arthur's love was transferred—transferred to her sister. The infidelity of the two beings she most loved on earth, almost broke her heart; but, as the most touching of writers has said of the sweetest manifestation of character, the “temper of Emma was like an æolian harp whose sounds die away in the tempest, and are heard again in every gentle breeze.” She said nothing, she looked nothing; she was much alone, and found her troubled spirit found rest where it is only to be in every modification of human misery, in those high communings that are on the spiritual mount, far above the atmosphere of mortal passions. Anna felt the rebuke of Emma's silence and downcast eye far more than she would the gentlest even of reproaches—an involuntary look. She accused herself, she wept, she fell at her sister's feet, she offered to abjure her lover for ever. Emma folded her in her arms, and it was long before either could speak or listen; but when Emma could utter her resolves gently, softly, tenderly, as they were spoken, it was evident they were unalterable. “That bond, Anna, is severed for ever; we are sisters, our God has united us by this tie, our sin alone can destroy or weaken it; it has been rudely jarred, but it is not harmed—is it Anna?” Anna only replied by a more fervent embrace, a freer burst of tears. Emma was long silent, but when she at last spoke, no one would have detected in the tones of her voice a feeling stronger than sisterly tenderness. “During their interview, Anna confessed that the inconstant, but really ardent, and I must say really honourable lover— “Oh! say nothing in his favour! say nothing in his favour! interrupted, in one voice, the indignant young auditors. “Ah! my dear girls,” replied Mrs. Tudor, “we learn, as we go on in life, to look far more in sorrow than in anger, on the transgressions of our fellow beings; we know better how to estimate human infirmity and the power of temptation; but I have no time to moralize. I will only beg you to remember, when you have still more cause for indignation against poor M`Arthur, that he was then scarce twenty-two, that he was spoiled by fortune, by admiring friends, and by that chief spoiler, a doting, widowed mother; and, lest you should be too harsh, let me tell you, that he has since redeemed, by a virtuous life, the follies, aye, the sins of his youth. “Where was I? Oh! on the point of telling you that Anna confessed M`Arthur had urged an immediate marriage, without a reference to her father, which, he maintained, experience had taught them would be useless. “The military events of the day,” he said, “indicated that the British forces would soon be withdrawn from —town, and his last letters from his commanding officer, intimated that he would then probably be transferred to the southern army.” “He intreated, with all the vehemence of love, that Anna would give him a right to claim her, as his wife, when the disastrous war should be over. Anna had half consented to sacrifice her filial duty. Against this Emma remonstrated most earnestly. She adjured her sister not to provoke the wrath of Heaven, so sure speedily to overtake filial disobedience. She saw M`Arthur; and, with the unfaltering, and almost irresistible voice of determined virtue, intreated him not to tempt her sister to this departure from filial duty. “ `But of what use,' asked M`Arthur, `will be an appeal to your father, when his old prejudices will be all justified by,' his voice sunk to an almost inaudible tone, `by the demerit that none but an angel would forgive?' “ `Emma hesitated for a few moments, and then said, with decision, `I will go to him myself.' “ `You, Emma! You cannot, you shall not; there are a thousand dangers!' “ `There are none that need to deter me. I will go. My father, though terrible to his enemies and stern to the world, never denied me anything that I asked myself from him. I am sure I can make such representations that he will give me his consent. I will hear nothing more from you,—no, I will not hear your thanks till I return; provide a proper guard to attend me as far as your lines extend, I shall have nothing to fear after I get among our own people.” “M`Arthur would have poured out his admiration and gratitude, but Emma fled from it all, and hastily H prepared herself for her romantic expedition. A small detachment of the regular army, and a large body of militia, to which her father was attached, had approached within fifty miles of —town; but for a young girl to traverse this distance in the unsettled state of the country, required all the spirit that a noble purpose inspires, and all the courage of heaven-born innocence. Poor Emma endured manifold fears, and encountered some dangers; but this detail I reserve for some other time. At the expiration of the third day she arrived safely at the American quarters. “When her father's first surprise and joy at seeing her was over, she communicated, with her own sweet grace and earnestness, the purpose of her journey. No words can ever describe her father's rage. I would not repeat to you, if I could, his horrible language. He commanded her, on pain of his everlasting displeasure, never again to mention the name of M`Arthur. He looked upon his daughters as bewitched by a spell of the arch enemy. He said M`Arthur's conduct was just what he should have expected from an English scoundrel, from any, or all of the miscreants. Every breath that Emma dared to utter, swelled the torrent of his rage. He swore to revenge her wrongs, to avenge his polluted home; and, finally, he concluded by pronouncing curses, loud and deep, and as poor Emma thought, interminable on Anna, if she did not immediately break off all connexion with M`Arthur, and abjure him forever. “Emma trembled and wept. She knew how unrelenting was her father's determination, and her whole anxiety now was to save her sister from these terrible curses, as fearful to the duteous Emma as the wrath of Heaven. She set out on her return without any delay. A variety of circumstances protracted her journey. When she arrived at the point where M`Arthur's guard was to meet her, no guard was there, and her progress was arrested by an American officer, a friend of her father's, who absolutely forbade her proceeding. The British, he said, were daily contracting their lines. There were almost hourly skirmishes between small detachments of soldiers, and nothing could be more perilous than for a young woman to traverse even the short distance that remained to her home. She was conducted to a comfortable lodging in a kind family, but no kindness or security could tranquilize her troubled and anxious mind. She knew too well the impetuous temper of M`Arthur to hope he would have patience to await her return, and she feared that her light-hearted, reckless, sanguine sister, would, trusting implicitly to her success, yield to the importunities of her lover. For three weeks she was compelled to endure these apprehensions; to endure the thought that she was freighted with those curses that were to fall on her sister's head like the withering vengeance of Heaven. “At last she was permitted to proceed, and she arrived at —town without the slightest molestation or accident. As soon as she entered it, she saw that the aspect of things was entirely changed. The military array that had given to the quiet scene a temporary life and bustle, had vanished. The street was as quiet as a sabbath morning. A few well known faces appeared peeping from the doors and windows. Emma did not stop to ask any explanation, she did not even see their welcoming nods and smiles; and though an old man, the walking chronicle of the town, quickened his pace towards her, as if he would be the first to communicate what tidings there were, she hurried her horse onward. Her home was on the outskirts of the town. When she reached it, her servant girl met her at the gate, and broke forth in exclamation of—Emma knew not what. She cast one wild glance around the parlour, screamed Anna's name, and flew to her apartment. The one fear that she had gone with M`Arthur prevailed over every other. She opened her chamber door, she was there, buried in her shawl, and weeping aloud. At the sight of Emma she uttered an exclamation of surprise and joy, and her voice dying away in bitter grief, `Oh! Emma, my sister,' she murmured, `he is gone, my husband is gone!' `Your husband!' cried Emma, and it was long, long, my dear girls, before she uttered another word. It was as she had apprehended. M`Arthur had been impatient of her delay, and had persuaded Anna to a private marriage, only one week after Emma had left them. Emma did not reproach her sister, she would not have added a feather's weight to the inevitable consequences of her rashness. Those consequences it was now her anxious care to avert. She only communicated to Anna so much of her father's reply as expressed his firm negative. This was fearful enough to Anna; but as her marriage had been strictly private, she hoped to keep it from his knowledge, and Emma, to shield her sister, prepared herself, for the first time in her life, for evasion and concealment. “There was now no obstacle to her father's return. He came home the next day, and his wrath against the enemy grew at every trace of their footsteps. He suspected nothing, but he was for some time less kind and frank to his daughters than formerly. He never alluded to their guest by words, but, when anything having the most distant relation to his residence with them occurred, he would contract his brow, become suddenly pale, bite his lips, and indicate, in ways too obvious to his gentle daughters, that his hatred burnt as fiercely as ever. “Sally, the servant, made her appearance before him one day in a holiday suit, with a gay locket dangling from her neck. `Ah! Sally,' said Blunt, `where did you get that pretty finery in these hard times?' “The girl knew her master's infirmity, she saw the colour mount to her young ladies' cheeks, and she stammered out, as if she had stolen it, `Captain M`Arthur gave it to me, Sir.' Blunt tore it from her neck, and crushed it under his foot. “Some weeks after this startling demonstration of his unabated hatred, and several months after M`Arthur's departure, a little crippled boy, who lived on an adjoining farm, came into Blunt's parlour with a pretty flute sticking in his hat-band. `Ah! Jerry, my boy,' said the old man kindly, for, like the lion, he was tender to all small and defenceless creatures. `Ah! Jerry, that is the little flute that makes such pleasant music for us of these moonlight evenings, and that piped such a merry welcome to us the day we came home, is it? let's see it, Jerry.' Jerry gave it to him. Emma and Anna trembled. `Oh!' said Jerry, `if you could only have heard the captain play it, Sir; he gave it to me for finding Miss Anna's ring.' “The poor boy's flute was instantly crackling in the flames, and a fiery, suspicious, questioning glance darted at Anna. It fell on the ring—the fatal wedding ring. Oh! my dear girls, I cannot describe the scene that followed. All Blunt's honest feelings were wounded, all his fierce passions excited. Emma, fearless for herself, wept and interceded for her sister; but her voice could no more be heard than the wail of an infant amidst the raging of the ocean. Anna was cast out from his door, commanded never again to enter his presence, every name of dishonour was heaped upon her, and, while she lay on his door step, fainting in her sister's arms—for Emma, in spite of his commands, supported her—the last sounds she heard were her father's curses. “Emma watched over Anna's fate with more than a sister's love. She procured a humble, but decent lodging for her, and expended her youth and strength in secretly working to obtain a pittance for her support. Blunt had peremptorily forbidden her ever to impart one shilling of his substance to his discarded child. Obedience to this command was the hardest of all H 2 Emma's trials; but she held fast her integrity, and was compelled to see daily delicacies that she loathed, to live in overflowing plenty, without daring to give a crumb that fell from her father's table to her poor sister. “Three months after Anna was driven from her father's house, she gave birth to a child, a boy, and, as if to fill up the measure of her sorrows, he was born blind. The poor, suffering, crushed mother; wore away her life in watching over her stricken boy, in sorrow for the past, and despair for the future. Five weary years were passed without one word of intelligence from her husband. Newspapers were then rare, and few found their way to —town, and in those few Emma, who diligently inquired, could never ascertain that any mention was made of M`Arthur. He might have perished in battle, might have returned to England, or, worse than all, might have forgotten his wife. Time had no tendency to soften the heart of Amos Blunt, time only cut in deeper the first decisions of his iron will. His property, though necessarily impaired by the war, was still far superior to his neighbours'; Emma was to inherit it all, and Emma, the dutiful and still lovely Emma was sought by many an earnest suitor. But she was alike deaf to all. She had no heart for anything but duty to her father and love to her sister, and the tenderest love to the little blind boy. For them she toiled, and with the inexhaustible ingenuity of affection, she devised for him every pleasure of which his darkened childhood was susceptible. She contrived toys to delight his ear. She sung for him for hours together. Every body in the country round loved Miss Emma, and the little rangers of flood and field brought her wild fruit and sweet flowers for her favourite. “The child seemed to be infected with his mother's melancholy. He would lie on the floor for hours in most unnatural inactivity; but when he heard Emma's step, his feet danced, his hands were outstretched, his lips were raised, every limb, every feature welcomed her, all but that sparkling gem that most brightly and piercingly speaks the feelings of the soul. Emma would take him from his drooping mother's side, and try by exercise, and the free enjoyment of the genial air, to win the colour to his cheek, but alas! in vain. “Finally, my dear girls, that power, at whose touch the sternest bend, laid his crushing hand on Blunt. A slow, but mortal disease seized him; he knew he must die. He had long before made his will, and given everything to Emma, but on condition that she never should transfer one penny of his property in any form to her sister. If she violated this condition, his estate was to be divided into one hundred dollar annuities, to be given to such survivors of the war as had served in the revolutionary army from the beginning of the contest, and could give sufficient testimony of their having killed each ten Englishmen. “Among Emma's most constant and heartily devoted lovers was one Harry Lee. He was the favourite of her father. He had fought, and had triumphed beside him; and to give Emma to Harry before he died, was the father's most earnest wish. On this subject he became every day more and more importunate. At first, Emma, who really felt a strong friendship for Lee, only said, `Father, Harry knows I cannot love him.' “ `What does that signify?' the old man would reply; `Harry knows you say that, to be sure; but he is willing to take you without it; a dutiful child will make a dutiful wife; and I tell Harry love is nothing but a jack-o'-lantern business.' “When this conversation was renewed in every form that could express that this was Blunt's strongest and almost only earthly wish, it occurred to Emma it was possible that, by a sacrifice of her feelings in this affair, she might induce her father to relent towards Anna. This was the hardest sacrifice a woman could make—but she was a noble creature.” “Oh! grandmamma,” exclaimed Isabel, “too, too noble—I cannot believe you are telling us a true story —I cannot believe that any woman so wronged as Emma, would have made such exertions, such sacrifices.” “I believe it,” said Lucy Atwell, her face kindling with an expression of fervent feeling, “I know there has been one woman capable of any virtue—my mother,” she added, dropping her face on Mrs. Tudor's lap. We were all affected at this involuntary tribute to her mother, for whom she was still in deep mourning, and it was some moments before Mrs. Tudor proceeded, and then in a faltering voice; “It is, in spite of your unbelief, Isable, `an o'er true tale.' Emma prepared herself for a scene, and then, her face beaming with her celestial spirit, and her voice sustained by firm resolve, she told her father that she would comply with his wishes—that she would marry Harry Lee, if he would provide by will for her sister, and revoke those terrible curses that had already blasted her innocent offspring with blindness, and were consuming her life. The old man heard her without interruption, and without reply; a deadly paleness overspread his countenance, large drops of sweat rolled from his face, his breathing was difficult, and it seemed that the terrible conflict of unexpressed feeling must snap the worn thread of life. Emma was dreadfully alarmed; she dared not then urge him further but used every means to tranquilize and revive him. “For two days these convulsive agitations continued, more or less violent. He spoke not one word to Emma, he did not even look at her; but still there was something in the gentle touch of his hand as he received the cordials she gave, that kept her hope alive —but just alive, for the physician had pronounced him dying. He revived, as is usual before the last struggle, and, looking Emma, for the first time since she had spoken on the forbidden topic, full in the face, he bade her bring him a certain sealed packet from his desk. She obeyed. It was his will. With his trembling hands he tore it to fragments, and said, as he did so, `The law will do right to you—both.' Emma fell on her knees; `Oh, dear father!' she cried, `say you forgive her.' “ `I can't, Emma; but I have—I have prayed God to forgive her; now, my good child, pray for your father.' Emma began that sacred petition, that blessed essence of all prayer, `Our Father,' and her parent, in a low dying whisper, repeated the words after her. When she came to the clause, `forgive us our trespasses as we'—`Stop,' he cried, in his own energetic voice, for then he, for the first time, understood the full import of those words, `stop! that I may not say.' At this moment Anna, the poor, disobedient, discarded, suffering child, rushed with her boy in her arms to the bedside. She knelt by Emma, she stretched out her hands, and her lips trembled with the prayer she could not utter. Pale, emaciated, her form attenuated, her eye sunken—was this the bright, blooming, gay Anna? To her father's eye she looked heaven-stricken, and indeed accursed. He groaned from his inmost soul. `Oh! I do forgive, but,' as he closed his eyes, `I never will forget;' and thus divided between the obdurate passions of earth, and the victorious spirit of Heaven, he heaved his last breath.” Mrs. Tudor paused, her auditors were silent, appalled by the history of passions too stern to have come within the scope of their young experience, or even their imaginations. Isabel was the first to resume her interest in the progress of the story, and to revert to M`Arthur, who, in his character of an English officer, had peculiar claims in her eyes. “Grandmamma,” she said, “I hope we have got over the dreadful part of the story, through the thick of it; Anna must die, that I see—poor, poor girl! I am sure she suffered more than she sinned—and I foresee how it will end, M`Arthur will return, find his wife dead, and marry Emma.” “But,” said Lucy, “that was impossible, you know, after her promise to marry Harry Lee.” “Oh! he was a generous fellow; I dare say he gave that up, and it would be a different case, you know, after poor Anna died. Ah! I know now how it will all be. Grandmamma began by saying it was a ghost story, and the only one she ever heard she fully believed. `Alas! poor ghost!' we did all forget thee. Anna's ghost appeared to Emma, and bade her marry M`Arthur, or perhaps the old man's—oh! I should hate to see him come back.” “Well, my dear Isabel, if you are not more interested in your own speculations than in my story, I will proceed; and, in the first place, I assure you the old man's spirit never revisited the earth. I am a little astonished that you should, for a moment, think M`Arthur worthy of the saintly Emma; but, since you have such a predilection for him, I will let you know your instincts do not entirely err. He did afterwards become all that I—that—that his mother ever hoped of him. “He was, as he had expected to be, transferred to the army of the south. The ardour of his attachment to his wife was unabated for a long time; but he received no communications from her, and his own letters and remittances never reached her. After the lapse of two years the impression made by his short intercourse with Anna, in some measure faded. He distinguished himself in his military career, was loaded with favours by his commanding officer, he associated exclusively with the high-born, gay, and, I fear, in too many cases, unprincipled young men of the army, and his own natural pride and self-indulgence were fostered; and—it must be told—he looked back on his humble alliance with mortification and deep regret. He never communicated it to a human being. At last came that monitor, so friendly, so necessary to human virtue, that messenger of Heaven—sickness. For months he was confined and wasting away under the effects of the fever of the southern climate, and it was not till about the period of the peace that he had health and strength to execute a resolution he had formed and cherished in the salutary solitude of his sick-room. “A few weeks after Amos Blunt's death, M`Arthur, mounted on a fine, but way-worn steed, reined him up, at an inn, a few miles distant from —town. It was late, on a mild star-lit evening. Two or three men were sitting in the porch of the inn. His intention was to make some inquiries in relation to his wife's family, but he could not utter them. He merely asked, `How far is it to —town?' `Five miles and better.' He did summon courage to add, `How far to Amos Blunt's? he lives, I think a little on this side of the town?' `Yes; it is four miles to Amos Blunt's, to where he did live; the old man is dead, but you'll find some of the family there.' “M`Arthur turned his horse's head abruptly, and spurred him on, afraid to hear another word; and he hurried him forward, or slackened his pace, as his hopes or fears prevailed. His mind was overshadowed with dark apprehensions; the lapse of years had given a new colouring to life, the pangs of awakened conscience a new aspect to his past career. He now looked, with something bordering on contempt, on his boyish, impetuous, and inconstant passion, and with deep anguish on his rash marriage and criminal neglect. He felt that he deserved the judgments of Heaven; he believed he was going to receive them. “His road gradually wound up a mountain. The feeble star-light was shut out by the towering pines, the lighter beeches, and the straggling dwarf oaks, that, with all their summer's growth of foliage, overhung the path. The woods were alive with the autumn insects, whose monotonous notes, associated as they are with the first fading and decay of nature, are always sad. To M`Arthur they seemed creatures of evil omen, and a whip-poor-will, who had lingered behind his tribe, for it was now September, and was perched on a blasted and riven oak, repeating his piercing plaint, was a bird of evil augury to his disturbed imagination. What sweet intimations these `wood notes wild' would have conveyed to the sense of a returning happy and hopeful lover! and how true it is that the mind does not receive, but gives its impressions to the outward world! When M`Arthur attained the summit of the mountain, the wide amphitheatre in in which —town lay, was outspread before him. The waning moon had just risen above the horizon, but was veiled by a mass of dense clouds, their silvered edges just giving the intimation of her sweet presence. Above the moon there was a singular illumination of the atmosphere, resembling a column of golden mist, now streaming up like the most brilliant northern lights, and then fading and melting away in the clear depths of ether. The phenomenon was beautiful, but it was singular, and, to M`Arthur it appeared unnatural and portentous; so apt is man, even in his misery, to magnify himself, and so quick is his conscience to interpret and apply the manifestations of nature in the glorious heavens, as if they were a `hand-writing on the wall.' “Every variety of evil that could have happened to his wife, by turns offered itself to M`Arthur's imagination; but the fear that she might be dead, that she had passed the barrier whence the voice of forgiveness and love never comes, was stronger than any other. As he proceeded, the moon rose triumphantly above the clouds, and lent him her clear and steady light. He passed a rustic bridge, a sudden turn in the road, and mounted a little knoll that brought him in full view of Blunt's house. There it stood, just as he had left it, an irregular and spacious building, with its wealth of outhouses and its court yard, sparingly dotted with a few lilacs. Not a single `little beam' of cheering, hope-inspiring light streamed from any of its windows; all was dark and sullen. “Before M`Arthur reached the house, he had to pass a spot associated with his tenderest recollections, and now with his saddest fears. It was a smooth green area of about forty yards in breadth, level to the road-side, but elsewhere enclosed by a steep rocky bank, thickly set with maples, beech, and lime trees. Two old and magnificent elms sheltered this little sanctuary from the road. Amos Blunt, rough as he was, blind and deaf to all the beauties and appeals of nature, at some soft moment, had his heart touched by the genius of this sacred spot, and there he had said he would bury his dead. There M`Arthur had often been with the two sisters to visit their mother's grave; the sight of her grave inspired them with tenderness unmingled with gloom, and there they had often talked with him of death, as young persons, my dear girls, talk of it, to whom it is a matter of sentiment, not of experience. “M`Arthur felt a coldness and shivering come over him, as he approached the little wicket gate, where he knew he could see distinctly every mound of earth. `I will not look that way,' he said to himself, `I cannot bear to learn my fate here.' But he could not command his eye. It turned by irresistible instinct, and was fixed. He saw a figure approaching a grave, that, dim as the light was, appeared newly made. The figure had the height and movement of his wife. It was enveloped in a winding-sheet and, having reached the grave, laid down beside it, and rested its head on it. M`Arthur's fears now all I vanished, for they had sprung, not from cowardice, but affection. He was not superstitious, all the habits of his mind and his life were opposed to superstition; and his first impression was that he was tricked by his sickly fancy, that his gloomy portents, the lateness of the hour, the associations of the place, and his coward conscience had conjured up the apparition before him. He dismounted from his horse, turned his eyes from the figure to assure himself, by each familiar and sensible appearance, of the reality of the scene, and then, resolved not to be the sport of idle fancies, again turned towards the grave. “The figure was still extended there. He approached so near as to discern the features. It was no illusion of his disordered imagination—the death-stricken cheek laid on the glittering and broken sods. It was the form of his wife, such as she was at parting, save the mortal paleness, and the signet sage that sad thought had stamped on her brow. Her face wore the peace and serenity of death, without its sternness; her eyelashes rested on her cheek as if the lids had fallen naturally in sleep. There was nothing of the rigidity of death about the figure; even the winding-sheet in which it was enfolded, had nothing of the precision of the drapery of death, but was wrapped about the form with a careless grace. One arm was thrown over the grave, as if encircling some loved object, with a consciousness of possession and security, and on the finger gleamed the wedding ring! M`Arthur at first gazed at the apparition with a critical eye. Incredulity was roused, and reason questioned, revolted from being duped by a mere phantasm of the brain; but as he gazed, as he marked each well remembered feature, his incredulity was overcome, his reason assented to the convictions of his senses, and yielding himself to the power of this awful visitation from the dead, he prostrated himself on the earth, and breathed a prayer he could not utter, that Heaven would vouchsafe to interpret the purpose of this spectral apparition to his senses. Again he lifted his head and looked at that silent, immoveable figure. In the eagerness of excited feelings, he drew nearer to it, he knelt beside it, he bent over it, and gazed till the awe and shrinking from a preternatural appearance gave place to a gush of tenderness and bitter grief and broken ejaculation to the spirit of his wife. “At the sound of his impassioned voice, the figure became instinct with life, the blood mounted to her lips and cheeks, and Anna, his living Anna, stood before him. Her eye glanced wildly around, then fell on the new made grave, then fixed on her husband, and, uttering a shriek, expressive of her alarmed and uncertain feelings, she sunk senseless in his arms. She was living—he might hear the accents of forgiveness and love from her lips, and, nerved by this blessed assurance, he bore her in his arms to her father's house. Emma, first awakened by his footsteps, was at the door. “I need not, my dear girls, detain you with any unnecessary particulars. The grave, as you have no doubt conjectured, was the little blind boy's. He had been interred there the preceding day; and his poor mother, exhausted by many nights' watchings, had in a deep sleep, risen, wrapped the sheet over her night dress, and, led by her feverish dreams, had gone to the grave over which her imagination and affections hovered.” We were all silent for a few moments, partly absorbed in the pleasure of finding the story turn out better for the happiness of all concerned than we had expected, and partly—I must confess it—disappointed that it was, after all, no ghost story. Isabel, as usual, was the first to speak. “And M`Arthur, grandmamma,” said she, “was M`Arthur always afterwards faithful and kind?” “Always, my dear Isabel. He took his wife to England, where she was honourably received by his mother, and she has since been ever tenderly cherished.” “And Emma,” asked Lucy, “the sweet, excelling, sacrificing Emma, of course she married as she promised?” “Yes, my dear girl, she did so; and in her growing affection for her excellent husband, she found what is not always the consequence of a first and romantic passion, a stable and tranquil happiness.” “But,” asked Isabel, “what did Anna — what could she do, to testify her gratitude to that angelic sister?” “There are feelings, Isabel, for which there is no adequate expression, but Anna manifested in every mode their relative condition permitted her, love and gratitude; and Emma was satisfied, for when a sudden reverse of fortune befell her, and was followed by a mortal sickness, she bequeathed her only daughter to her sister, in the reposing confidence that she would share an equal care, an almost equal love with her own child.” Isabel looked eagerly in Mrs. Tudor's face—she started up, “Grandmamma!” she exclaimed, “it is so —I know it is. You have been telling us of our mothers!” It was plain enough that she had guessed rightly. She turned to Lucy and folded her in her arms. I saw in Isabel's glowing face, and fine up-raised eye, the quick succeeding thoughts that were afterwards embodied in sisterly affection and kindness to Lucy; and Lucy's saintly face shone with a holy triumph such as the virtue of a parent may inspire. The reason why these circumstances had never before been related to the daughters was obvious; the reason why Mrs. Tudor had now disclosed them, and deferred the expose, by using assumed names, was as apparent, and fully approved by its permanent happy influence. Isabel, with the generosity of a noble nature, assumed her mother's debt; and the only vestige I perceived of the worldliness that tinged her first intercourse with Lucy, was in the elaborate care with which she lavished all the elegant refinements of fashion on the native graces of the Country Cousin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I 2 OLD MAIDS. “To be the mistress of some honest man's house, and the means of making neighbours happy, the poor easy, and relieving strangers, is the most creditable lot a young woman can look to, and I heartily wish it to all here.” —Pirate. “Mrs. Seton, Emily Dayton is engaged to William Moreland!” “To William Moreland. Well, why should she not be engaged to William Moreland?” “Why should she, rather?” “I know not Emily Dayton's `why,' but ladies' reasons for marrying are as `thick as blackberries.' A common motive with girls under twenty is the éclat of an engagement—the pleasure of being the heroine of bridal festivities—of receiving presents—of being called by that name so enchanting to the imagination of a miss in her teens—`the bride.”' “But Emily Dayton, you know, is past twenty.” “There is one circumstance that takes place of all reason—perhaps she is in love.” “In love with William Moreland! No, no, Mrs. Seton—there are no `merry wanderers of the night' in these times to do Cupid's errands, and make us dote on that which we should hate.” “Perhaps then, as she is at a rational age, three or four and twenty, she may be satisfied to get a kind sensible protector.” “Kind and sensible, truly! He is the most testy, frumpish, stupid man you can imagine.” “Does she not marry for an establishment?” “Oh no! She is perfectly independent, mistress of every thing at her father's. No, I believe her only motive is that which actuates half the girls—the fear of being an old maid. This may be her last chance. Despair, they say, makes men mad—and I believe it does women too. “It is a fearful fate.” “An old maid's? Yes, most horrible.” “Pardon me, Anne, I did not mean that; but such a fate as you anticipate for Emily Moreland—to be yoked in the most intimate relation of life, and for life, to a person to whom you have clung to save you from shipwreck, but whom you would not select to pass an evening with. To such a misery there can be no `end, measure, limit, bound.”' “But, my dear Mrs. Seton, what are we to do?— all women cannot be so fortunate as you are.” “Perhaps not. But so kind is the system of compensation in this life—such the thirst for happiness, and so great the power of adaptation in the human mind, that the conjugal state is far more tolerable than we should expect when we see the mismated parties cross its threshold. Still there can be no doubt that its possible happiness is often missed, and such is my respect for my sex, and so high my estimate of the capabilities of married life, that I cannot endure to see a woman, from the fear of being an old maid, driven into it, thereby forfeiting its highest blessings.” “You must nevertheless confess, Mrs. Seton, that there are terrors in the name.” “Yes, I know there are; and women are daily scared by them into unequal and wretched connexions. They have believed they could not retain their identity after five and twenty. That unless their individual existence was merged in that of the superior animal, every gift and grace with which God has endowed them would exhale and leave a `spectral appearance'—a sort of slough of woman—an Aunt Grizzel, or Miss Lucretia McTab. I have lived, my dear Anne, to see many of the mists of old superstitions melting away in the light of a better day. Ghost is no longer a word to conjure with— witches have settled down into harmless and unharmed old women; and I do not despair of living to see the time when it shall be said of no woman breathing, as I have heard it said of such and such a lady, who escaped from the wreck at the eleventh hour, that she `married to die a Mrs.”' “I hate, too, to hear such things said, but tell me honestly, Mrs. Seton, now when no male ears are within hearing, whether you do not, in your secret soul, think there is something particularly unlovely, repelling, and frightful, in the name of an old maid.” “In the name, certainly; but it is because it does not designate a condition but a species. It calls up the idea of a faded, bony, wrinkled, skinny, jaundiced personage, whose mind has dwindled to a point —who has outlived her natural affections—survived every love but love of self, and self-guarded by that Cerberus suspicion—in whom the follies of youth are fresh when all its charms are gone—who has retained, in all their force, the silliest passions of the silliest women—love of dress, of pleasure, of admiration; who, in short, is in the condition of the spirits in the ancients' Tartarus, an impalpable essence tormented with the desires of humanity. Now turn, my dear Anne, from this hideous picture to some of our acquaintance who certainly have missed the happiest destiny of woman, but who dwell in light, the emanation of their own goodness. I shall refer you to actual living examples—no fictions.” “No fictions, indeed, for then you must return to the McTabs and Grizzles. Whatever your philanthropy may hope for that most neglected portion of our sex, no author has ventured so far from nature as to portray an attractive old maid. Even Mackenzie, with a spirit as gentle as my Uncle Toby's, and as tender as that of his own `Man of Feeling,' has written an essay in ridicule of `old maids.”' “And you are not perhaps aware, Anne, that he has written a poem called the `Recantation,' and dedicated it to his single daughter, a most lovely woman, who was the staff and blessing of his old age. In your wide range of reading cannot you think of a single exception to the McTabs and Grizzles?” “Miss Farrer's `Becca Duguid,' but she is scarcely above contempt, trampled on by the children, and the tool of their selfish and lazy mammas.” “There is one author, Anne, the most beloved, and the most lamented of all authors, who has not ventured to depart from nature, but has escaped prejudice, and prejudice in some of its most prevailing forms. He has dared to exhibit the Paynim Saladin as superior to the Christian crusader. He has dispelled the thick clouds that enveloped the `poor Israelite,' the most inveterate of all prejudices, transmitted from age to age, and authorised by the fancied sanctions of religion. I said the clouds were dispelled, but do they not rather hang around the glorious Rebecca, the unsullied image of her Maker, as the clouds that have broken away from the full moon encircled her, and are converted by her radiance to a bright halo?” “Mrs. Seton! Mrs. Seton! you are, or I am getting lost in all this mist and fog. What have Paynims and Jews to do with old maids? I do not remember an old maid in all Sir Walter's novels, excepting, indeed, Alison—Martha Trapbois—Meg Dods—one of Monkbarns' womankind, and Miss Yellowley, a true all-saving, fidgetting, pestering old maid, and the rest of them are entertaining but certainly not very exalting members of any sisterhood.” “But these are not my examples, Anne. I confess that they are fair examples of follies and virtues that, if not originated, are exaggerated and made conspicuous by single life. I confess too that for such foibles matrimony is often a kind and safe shelter. But to my examples. Sir Walter—and who is more poetically just than Sir Walter?—has abandoned to the desolate, tragic, and most adhorred fate of old maids, his three first female characters—first in all respects, in beauty, in mind, in goodness, first in our hearts. The accomplished Flora M`Ivor—the peerless Rebecca, and the tender, beautiful Minna.” “Bless me! I never thought of this.” “No, nor has one in a thousand of the young ladies who have admired these heroines laid the moral of their story to heart. Perhaps not one of the fair young creatures who has dropped a tear over the beautiful sentence that closes the history of Minna,[5] [5] “Thus passed her life, enjoying, from all who approached her, an affection enhanced by reverence, insomuch that when her friends sorrowed for her death, which arrived at a late period of her existence, they were comforted by the fond reflection, that the humanity which she then laid down, was the only circumstance which had placed her, in the words of scripture, `A little lower than the angels.”' has been conscious that she was offering involuntary homage to the angelic virtues of an old maid. The very term would have wrought a disenchanting spell.” “I confess, Mrs. Seton, I am in what is vulgarly called a `blue maze.' My perceptions are as imperfect as the man's in scripture who was suddenly cured of blindness. Besides I was never particularly skilful at puzzling out a moral; will you have the goodness to extract it for me?” “Certainly, Anne, as I am the lecturer, this is my duty. First, I would have young ladies believe that all beautiful and loveable young women do not of course get married—that charms and virtues may exist, and find employment in single life—that a single woman, an old maid, (I will not eschew the name,) may love and be loved if she has not a husband, and children of her own. I would have her learn that if, like Flora M`Ivor, she has been surrounded by circumstances that have caused her thoughts and affections to flow in some other channel that love, she need not wed a chance Waverly to escape single life; that if, like Rebecca, she is separated by an impassable gulf from him she loves, she need not wed one whom she does not love, but like the high souled Jewess she may transmute `young Cupid's fiery shafts,' to chains that shall link her to all her species; and if like poor Minna she has thrown away her affections on a worthless object, she may live on singly, and so well that she will be deemed but `little lower than the angels.' “After all it is not such high natures as these that need to be fortified by argument, or example. They are born equal to either fortune. But I would entreat all my sex—those even who have the fewest and smallest gifts—to reverence themselves, to remember that it is not so much the mode of their brief and precarious existence that is important, as the careful use of those faculties that make existence a blessing here, and above all hereafter, where there is certainly `no marrying, nor giving in marriage;' but I am growing serious, and of course, I fear, tiresome to young ears.” “Oh, no, no, Mrs. Seton. These are subjects on which girls are never tired of talking nor listening; besides, you know you promised me some examples —such as Miss Hamilton and Miss Edgeworth, I suppose.” “No, Anne, these belong to the great exceptions I have mentioned, `equal to either fortune,' who, in any condition, would have made their `owne renowne, and happie days.' “I could adduce a few in our own country, known to both of us, who are the ornament of the high circles in which they move, but for obvious reasons I select humble persons—those who, like some little rivulet unknown to fame, bless obscure and sequestered places. There is Violet Flint—I always wondered how she came by so appropriate a name. That little flower is a fit emblem for her—smiling in earliest spring, and in latest fall—requiring no culture, and yet rewarding it—neglected and forgotten when the gay tribes of summer are caressed, and yet always looking from its humble station with the same cheerful face—bright and constant through the sudden reverses of autumn, and the adversity of the roughest winter. Such is the flower, and such is Violet Flint. But as I am now in realities, I must call her by the old maidenish appellation that, spoiling her pretty name, they have given to her, `Miss Vily.' She lives, and has for the last twenty years lived, with her brother Sam. He married young, a poor invalid, who, according to Napoleon's scale of merit, is a great woman, having given to the commonwealth nine or ten—more or less—goodly sons and daughters. After the children were born, all care of them, and of their suffering mother, devolved on Violet. Without the instincts, the claims, the rights, or the honours of a mother, she has not only done all the duties of a mother, but done them on the sure and broad basis of love. She has toiled and saved, and made others comfortable and enjoying, while she performed the usually thankless task of ordering the economy of a very frugal household. She has made the happy happier, tended the sick, and solaced the miserable. She sheltered the weak, and if one of the children strayed she was the apologist and intercessor. With all this energy of goodness the cause is lost in the blessed effects—she never appears to claim applause or notice. She is not only second best; but when indulgence or pleasure is to be distributed, her share is last and least—that is, according to the usual selfish reckoning. But according to a truer and nobler scale, her amount is greatest, for she has her share in whatever happiness she sees in any living thing. “How many married dames are there who repeat every fifteen minutes, my husband, my children, my house, and glorify themselves in all these little personalities, who might lay down their crowns at the feet of Violet Flint!—Miss Vily, the old maid. “The second example that occurs to me, is Sarah Lee. Sarah has not, like Violet, escaped all the peculiarities that are supposed to characterise the `Single-sides.' With the chartered rights of a married lady to fret, to be particular, and to have a way of her own, her temper would pass without observation; but being an old maid, she is called, and I must confess is, rather touchy. But what are these sparks, when the same fire that throws them off keeps warm an overflowing stream of benevolence?—look into her room.” “Oh, Mrs. Seton! I have seen it, and you must confess it is a true `Singleside' repository.” “Yes, I do confess it—nor will I shrink from the confession, for I wish to select for my examples, not any bright particular star, but persons of ordinary gifts, in the common walks of life. Had Sarah been married she would have been a thrifty wife, and painstaking mother, but she wore away her youth in devotion to the sick and old—and now her kindness, like the miraculous cruise, always imparting and never diminishing, is enjoyed by all within her little sphere. Experience has made her one of the best physicians I know. She keeps a variety of labelled medicines for the sick, plasters and salves of her own compounding, and materials with which she concocts food and beverages of every description, nutritious and diluent; in short, she has some remedy or solace for every ill that flesh is heir to. She has a marvellous knack of gathering up fragments, of most ingeniously turning to account what would be wasted in another's hands. She K not only has comfortables for shivering old women, and well patched clothes for neglected children, but she has always some pretty favour for a bride—some kind token for a new-born baby. And then what a refuge is her apartment for the slip-shod members of the family who are in distress for scissors, penknife, thimble, needle, hook and eye, buttons, a needle-full of silk or worsted of any particular colour. How many broken hearts she has restored with her inexhaustible glue-pot—mending tops, doll's broken legs, and all the luckless furniture of the baby-house—to say nothing of a similar ministry to the `minds diseased' of the mammas. Sarah Lee's labours are not always in so humble a sphere—`He who makes two blades of grass grow where one grew before,' says a political economist, `is a benefactor to his race.' If so, Sarah Lee takes high rank. “Two blades of grass! Her strawberry beds produce treble the quantity of any other in the village. Her potatoes are the `greatest yield'—her corn the earliest—her peas the richest—her squashes the sweetest—her celery the tenderest—her raspberries and currants the greatest bearers in the country. There is not a thimble-full of unoccupied earth in her garden. There are flowers of all hues, seasons, and climes. None die—none languish in her hands. “My dear Anne, I will not ask you if an existence so happy to herself, so profitable to others, should be dreaded by herself, neglected or derided by others. Yet Sarah Lee is an old maid.” “You are, I confess, very happy in your instances, Mrs. Seton, but remember the old proverb, `one swallow does not make a summer.”' “I have not done yet—and you must remember that in our country, where the means of supporting a family are so easily attained, and when there are no entails to be kept up at the expense of half a dozen single sisters, the class of old maids is a very small one. Many enter the ranks, but they drop off in the natural way of matrimony. Few maintain the `perseverance of saints.' Among those few is one, who, when she resigns the slight covering that invests her spirit, will lay down `all she has of humanity'—our excellent friend, Lucy Ray. “She is now gently drawing to the close of a long life, which I believe she will offer up without spot or blemish. She began life with the most fragile constitution. She has had to contend with that nervous susceptibility of temperament that so naturally engenders selfishness and irascibility, and all the miseries and weaknesses of invalidism. Not gifted with any personal beauty, or grace, she was liable to envy her more fortunate cotemporaries. Without genius, talents, or accomplishments to attract or delight, she has often been slighted—and what is far worse, must have been always liable to the suspicion of slights. But suspicion, that creator and purvey or of misery, never darkened her serene mind. She has lived in others and for others, with such an entire forgetfulness of self, that even the wants and weakness of her mortal part seem scarcely to have intruded on her thoughts. She has resided about in the families of her friends—a mode of life which certainly has a tendency to nourish jealousy, servility, and gossipping. But for what could Lucy Ray be jealous or servile? She craved nothing— she asked nothing, but, like an unseen, unmarked Providence, to do good; and as to gossipping, she had no turn for the ridiculous, no belief of evil against any human being—and as to speaking evil, `on her lips was the law of kindness.' You would hardly think, Anne, that a feeble, shrinking creature, such as I have described, and truly, Lucy Ray, could have been desired, as an inmate with gay young people, and noisy, turbulent children. She was always welcome, for, like her Divine Master, she came to minister— not to be ministered unto. “Lucy, like the Man of Ross, is deemed passing rich by the children, and an unfailing resource to the poor in their exigencies, though her income amounts to rather less than one hundred dollars!! “We sometimes admire the art of the Creator more in the exquisite mechanism of an insect than in the formation of a planet, and I have been more struck with the power of religion in the effect and exaltation it gave to the humble endowments of this meek woman, than by its splendid results in such a life as Howard's. Lucy Ray, by a faithful imitation of her master, by always aiding and never obstructing the principle of growth in her soul, has, through every discouragement and disability, reached a height but `little lower than the angels;' and when her now flickering light disappears, she will be lamented almost as tenderly (alas! for that almost) as if she were a mother; and yet, Anne, Lucy Ray is an old maid.” “You half persuade me to be one too, Mrs. Seton.” “No, Anne, I would by no means persuade you or any woman to prefer single life. It is not the `primrose path.' Nothing less than a spirit of meekness, of self renunciation, and of benevolence, can make a woman, who has once been first, happy in a subordinate and second best position. And this under ordinary circumstances is the highest place of a single woman. Depend upon it, my dear young friend, it is safer for most of us to secure all the helps to our virtues that attend a favourable position; besides, married life is the destiny Heaven has allotted to us, and therefore best fitted to awaken all our powers, to exercise all our virtues, and call forth all our sympathies. I would persuade you that you may give dignity and interest to single life, that you may be the cause of happiness to others, and of course happy yourself—for when was the fountain dry while the stream continued to flow? If single life, according to the worst view of it, is a moral desert, the faithful, in their passage through it, are refreshed with bread from Heaven and water from the rock. “I shall conclude with a true story. The parties are not known to you. The incidents occurred long ago, and I shall take the liberty to assume names; for I would not, even at this late day, betray a secret once confided to me, though time may long since have outlawed it. My mother had a school-mate and friend whom I shall call Agnes Gray. Her father was a country clergyman with a small salary, and the blessing that usually attends it—a large family of children. Agnes was the eldest, and after her following a line of boys, as long as Banquo's. At least, some ten years after Agnes, long waited and prayed for, appeared a girl, who cost her mother her life. “The entire care of the helpless little creature devolved on Agnes. She had craved the happiness of possessing a sister, and now, to a sister's love, she added the tenderness of a mother. Agnes' character was formed by the discipline of eircumstances—the surest of all discipline. A host of turbulent boys, thoughtless and impetuous, but kind-hearted, bright, and loving, had called forth her exertions and affections, and no one can doubt, either as lures or goads, had helped her on the road to heaven. Nature had, happily, endowed her with a robust constitution, and its usual accompaniment, a sweet temper; so that what were mountains to others, were mole hills to Agnes. `The baby,' of course, was the pet lamb of the fold. She was named, for her mother, Elizabeth; but, instead of that queenly appellation, she was always addressed by the endearing diminutive of Lizzy. Lizzy Gray was not only the pet of father, brothers, and sister at home—but the plaything of the village. “The old women knit their brightest yarn into tippets and stockings for the `minister's motherless little one' (oh, what an eloquent appeal was in those words!) K 2 the old men saved the `red cheeked' apples for her —the boys drew her, hour after hour, in her little wagon, and the girls made her rag babies. Still she was not in any disagreeable sense an enfant gatee. She was like those flowers that thrive best in warm and continued sunshine. Her soft hazle eye, with its dark sentimental lashes, the clear brunette tint of her complexion, and her graceful flexible lips, truly expressed her tender, loving, and gentle spirit. She seemed formed to be sheltered and cherished—to love and be loved; and this destiny appeared to be secured to her by her devoted sister, who never counted any exertion or sacrifice that procured an advantage or pleasure for Lizzy. When Lizzy was about fourteen, a relative of the family, who kept a first rate boarding school in the city, offered to take her for two years, and give her all the advantages of her school, for the small consideration of fifty dollars per annum. Small as it was, it amounted to a tithe of the parson's income. It is well known, that, in certain parts of our country, every thing (not always discreetly) is sacrificed to the hobby—education. Still the prudent father, who had already two sons at college, hesitated—did not consent till Agnes ascertained that by keeping a little school in the village she might obtain half the required sum. Her father, brothers, and friends all remonstrated. The toils of a school, in addition to the care and labour of her father's family, was, they urged, too much for her—but she laughed at them. `What was labour to her if she could benefit Lizzy—dear Lizzy!' All ended, as might be expected, in Lizzy going to the grand boarding school. The parting was a great and trying event in the family. It was soon followed by a sadder. The father suddenly sickened and died —and nothing was left for his family hut his house and well kept little garden. What now was to be done?— College and schools to be given up?—No such thing. In our country, if a youth is rich he ought to be educated; if he is poor he must be. The education is the capital whereby they are to live hereafter. It is obtained in that mysterious but unfailing way—`by hook and by crook.' “The elder Grays remained in college—Agnes enlarged her school—learned lessons in mathematics and Latin one day, and taught them the next; took a poor, accomplished young lady from some broken down family in town into partnership, and received a few young misses as boarders into her family. Thus, she not only was able to pay `dear Lizzy's' bills regularly, but to aid her younger brothers. Her energy and success set all her other attractions in a strong light, and she was admired and talked about, and became quite the queen of the village. “I think it was about a year after her father's death, that a Mr. Henry Orne, a native of the village, who was engaged in a profitable business at the south, returned to pass some months at his early home. His frequent visits to the parsonage, and his attentions, on all occasions, to Agnes, soon became matter of very agreeable speculation to the gossips of the village. `What a fine match he would be for Agnes!—such an engaging, well-informed young man, and so well off!' Agnes' heart was not steel; but though it had been exposed to many a flame she had kindled, in had never yet melted.” “Pardon me, Mrs. Seton, for interrupting you— was Agnes pretty?” “Pretty? The word did not exactly suit her. At the time of which I am now speaking, she was at the mature age of five and twenty; which is called the perfection of womanhood. Prettiness is rather appropriate to the bud than the ripened fruit. Agnes, I have been told, had a fine person—symmetrical features, and so charming an expression that she was not far from beautiful, in the eyes of strangers, and quite a beauty to her friends and lovers. Whether it were beauty, manners, mind, or heart, I know not—one and all probably—but Henry Orne soon became her assiduous and professed admirer. Till now Agnes had lived satisfied and happy with subordinate affections. She had never seen any one that she thought it possible she could love as well as she loved those to whom nature had allied her. But now the sun arose, and other lights became dim—not `that she loved Cæsar less, but she loved Rome more.' Their mutual faith was plighted, and both believed, as all real lovers do, that the world never contained so happy, so blessed a pair, as they were. “Lizzy's second year at school was nearly ended, and one month after her return the marriage was to be solemnised. In the mean time Agnes was full of the cares of this world. The usual preparations for the greatest occasion in a woman's life are quite enough for any single pair of hands, but Agnes had to complete her school term, and the possibility of swerving from an engagement never occurred to her. “Lizzy arrived, as lovely a creature as she had appeared in the dreams of her fond sister. In the freshness and untouched beauty of her young existence, just freed from the trammels of school, her round cheek glowing with health, and her heart overflowing with happiness. `Here is my own dear Lizzy,' said Agnes, as she presented her to Henry Orne, `and if you do not love me for any thing else, you must for giving you such a sister.' “Henry Orne looked at Lizzy and thought, and said, `the duty would be a very easy one.' `For the next month,' continued Agnes, `I shall be incessantly occupied, and you must entertain one another. Henry has bought a nice little pony for me, Lizzy, and he shall teach you to ride, and you shall go over all his scrambling walks with him—to Sky-cliff, Roseglen, and Beech-cove—the place he says nature made for lovers; but my poor lover has had to accommodate himself to my working day life and woo me in beaten paths.' “The next month was the most joyous of Lizzy's life; every day was a festival. To the perfection of animal existence in the country, in the month of June, was added the keen sense of all that physical nature conveys to the susceptible mind. “Wherever she was, her sweet voice was heard ringing in laughter, or swelling in music that seemed the voice of irrepressible joy—the spontaneous breathing of her soul. To the lover approaching his marriage day Time is apt to drag along with leaden foot, but to Henry Orne he seemed rather to fly with Mercury's wings at his heels; and when Agnes found herself compelled by the accumulation of her affairs, to defer her wedding for another month, he submitted with a better grace than could have been expected. Not many days of this second term had elapsed, when Agnes, amidst all her cares, as watchful of Lizzy as a mother of an only child, observed a change stealing over her. Her stock of spirits seemed suddenly expended, her colour faded—her motions were languid, and each successive day she became more and more dejected. `She wants rest,' said Agnes to Henry Orne; `she has been unnaturally excited, and there is now a reaction. She must remain quietly at home for a time, on the sofa, in a darkened room, and you, Henry, I am sure, will, for my sake, give up your riding and walking for a few days, and stay within doors, and play on your flute, and read to her.' Agnes' suggestions were promptly obeyed, but without the happy effect she anticipated. Lizzy, who had never before had a cloud on her brow, seemed to have passed under a total eclipse. She became each day more sad and nervous. A tender word from Agnes—a look, even, would make her burst into tears. “`I am miserable, Henry,' said Agnes, `at this unaccountable change in Lizzy—the doctor says she is perfectly free from disease—perhaps we have made too sudden a transition from excessive exercise to none at all. The evening is dry and fine, I wish you would induce her to take a walk with you. She is distressed at my anxiety, and I cannot propose any thing that does not move her to tears.' “`It is very much the same with me,' replied Henry, sighing deeply, but if you wish it I will ask her.' He accordingly did so—she consented, and they went out together. “Agnes retired to her own apartment, and there, throwing herself upon her knees, she entreated her Heavenly Father to withdraw this sudden infusion of bitterness from her brimming cup of happiness. `Try me in any other way,' she cried, in the intensity of her feeling, and, for the first time in her life, forgetting that every petition should be in the spirit of `Thy will be done,' `try me in any other way, but show me the means of restoring my sister—my child to health and happiness!' “She returned again to her little parlour. Lizzy had not come in, and she sat down on the sofa near an open window, and resigned herself to musings, the occupation, if occupation it may be called, of the idle, but rarely, and never of late, of Agnes! “In a few moments Lizzy and Henry returned, and came into the porch, adjoining the parlour. They perceived the candles were not lighted, and concluding Agnes was not there, they sat down in the porch.' “`Oh, I am too wretched!' said Lizzy. Her voice was low and broken, and she was evidently weeping. `Is it possible,' thought Agnes, `that she will express her feelings more freely to Henry than to me? I will listen. If she knows any cause for her dejection, I am sure I can remove it.' “`Why, my beloved Lizzy,' replied Orne, in a scarcely audible voice, `will you be so wretched— why will you make me so, and for ever, when there is a remedy?' “`Henry Orne!' she exclaimed, and there was resolution and indignation in her voice. `If you name that to me again, I will never, so help me God, permit you to come into my presence without witnesses. No, there is no remedy, but in death. Would that it had come before you told me you loved me—before my lips confessed my sinful love for you—no, no—the secret shall be buried in my grave.' “`Oh, Lizzy, you are mad—Agnes does not, cannot love as we do. Why sacrifice two to one? Let me, before it is too late, tell her the whole, and cast myself on her generosity.' “`Never, never—I now wish, when I am in her presence, that the earth at her feet would swallow me up; and how can you, for a moment, think I will ask to be made happy—that I could be made happy, at her expense? No, I am willing to expiate with my life, my baseness to her—that I shall soon do so is my only comfort—and you will soon forget me—men can forget, they say—' “`Never—on my knees, I swear never!'— “`Stop, for mercy's sake, stop. You must not speak another such word to me—I will not hear it.' She rose to enter the house. Agnes slipped through a private passage to her own apartment. “She heard Lizzy ascending the stairs. She heard Henry call after her, `One word, Lizzy—for mercy's sake, one last word.' But Lizzy did not turn. Agnes heard her feebly drag herself into the little dressing-room adjoining their apartment, and after, there was no sound but the poor girl's suppressed, but still audible sobs. “None but He who created the elements that compose the human heart, and who can penetrate its mysterious depths, can know which of the sisters was most wretched at that moment. To Agnes who had loved deeply, confidingly without a shadow of fear or distrust, the reverse was total. To Lizzy who had enjoyed for a moment the bewildering fervours of a young love, only to feel its misery, that misery was embittered by a sense of wrong done to her sister. And yet it had not been a willing, but an involuntary and resisted, and most heartily repented wrong. She had recklessly rushed down a steep to a fearful precipice, and now felt that all access and passage to return was shut against her. Agnes without having had one dim fear—without any preparation, saw an abyss yawning at their feet—an abyss only to be closed by her self-immolation. “She remained alone for many hours—she resolved—her spirit faltered—she re-resolved. She thought of all Lizzy had been to her, and of all she had been to Lizzy, and she wept as if her heart would break. She remembered the prayer that her impatient spirit had sent forth that evening. She prayed again, and a holy calm, never again to be disturbed, took possession of her soul. “There is a power in goodness, pure self-renouncing goodness, that cannot be `overcome, but overcometh all things.' “Lizzy waited till all was quiet in her sister's room. She heard her get into bed, and then stole softly to her. Agnes, as she had done from Lizzy's infancy, opened her arms to receive her, and Lizzy pillowed her aching head on Agnes' bosom, softly breathing,—`My sister—mother!' “`My own Lizzy—my child,' answered Agnes. There was no tell-tale faltering of the voice. She felt a tear trickle from Lizzy's cold cheek on to her bosom, and not very long after both sisters were in a sleep that mortals might envy, and angels smile on. “The rest you will anticipate, my dear Anne. The disclosure to the lovers of her discovery, was made by Agnes in the right way, and at the right time. Every thing was done as it should be by this most admirable woman. She seemed, indeed, to feel as a guardian angel might, who, by some remission of his vigilance, had suffered the frail mortal in his care to be beguiled into evil. She never, by word, or even look, reproached Lizzy. She shielded her, as far as possible, from self-reproach, nor do I believe she ever felt more unmixed tenderness and love for her, than when, at the end of a few months, she saw her married to Henry Orne. “My story has yet a sad supplement. Madame Cotin, I believe it is, advises a story teller to close the tale when he comes to a happy day; for, she says, it is not probable another will succeed it. Poor Lizzy had experience of this sad mutability of human life. Hers was checquered with many sorrows. “Lapses from virtue at eight and twenty, and at sixteen, afford very different indications of the character; you cannot expect much from a man, who, at eight and twenty, acted the part of Henry Orne. He was unfaithful in engagements with persons less merciful than Agnes Gray. He became inconstant in his pursuits—self-indulgent, and idle, and finally intemperate, in his habits. His wife—as wives will—loved him to the end. “Agnes retained her school, which had become in her hands a profitable establishment. There she laboured, year after year, with a courageous heart, and serene countenance, and devoted the fruit of all her toils to Lizzy, and to the education of her children. “I am telling no fiction, and I see you believe me, for the tears are trembling in your eyes—do not repress them, but permit them to embalm the memory of an old maid.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">L THE CHIVALRIC SAILOR.[6] [6] The original title of this story was “Modern Chivalry.” After its publication, the author discovered she had unwarily adopted a title already appropriated. “But when the hour of trouble comes to the mind or the body— and when the hour of death comes, that comes to high and low—Oh, my leddy, then it is'na what we hae dune for oursells, but what we hae dune for others, that we think on maist pleasantly.” Heart of Midlothian. The assertion that a tale is founded on fact, is a pious fraud of story tellers, too stale to impose on any but the very young, or very credulous. We hope, therefore, not to be suspected of resorting to an expedient that would expose our poverty without relieving it, when we declare that the leading incidents of the following tale are true—that they form, in that district of country where some of the circumstances transpired, a favourite and well authenticated tradition—and that our hero boasts with well-earned self-complacency, that there is no name better known than his from “Cape May to the Head of Elk.” That name, however honourable as it is, must be suppressed, and we here honestly beg the possessor's pardon for compelling him for the first time in his life, to figure under false colours. In the year 1768, an American vessel lying in the Thames and bound to Oxford, a small sea-port on the eastern shore of Maryland, was hailed by a boat containing a youth, who, on presenting himself to the captain, stated that he had a fancy for a sailor's life, and offered his services for two years, on the simple condition of kind treatment. The captain, though himself a coarse illiterate man, perceived in the air and language of the lad indications of good breeding, and deeming him some disobedient child, or possibly a runaway apprentice, declined receiving him. But William Herrion, as he called himself, was so earnest in his solicitations, and engaging in his manners, and the captain, withal, in such pressing need of a cabin-boy, that he waved his scruples, quieted his conscience with the old opiate that it was best not to be more nice than wise, and without inquiring too curiously into the boy's right of self-disposal, drew up some indentures, by which he entitled himself to two years' service. The boy was observed for the first day to wear a troubled countenance. His eye glanced around with incessant restlessness, as if in eager search of some expected object. While the ship glided down the Thames, he gazed on the shore as if he looked for some signal on which his life depended, and when she passed Gravesend, the last point of embarcation, he wept convulsively. The captain believed him to be disturbed with remorse of conscience; the sailors, that these heart-breakings were lingerings for his native land, and all hinted their rude consolations. Soothed by their friendly efforts, or by his own reflections, or perhaps following the current of youth that naturally flows to happiness, William soon became tranquil, and sometimes even gay. He kept, as the sailors said, on the fair weather side of the captain, a testy, self-willed old man, who loved but three things in the world— his song, his glass, and his own way. All that has been fabled of the power of music over stones and brutes, was surpassed by the effect of the lad's melting voice on the icy heart of the captain, whom forty years of absolute power had rendered as despotic as a Turkish Pacha. When their old commander blew his stiffest gale, as the sailors were wont to term his blustering passions. Will could, they said, sing him into a calm. Will of course became a doting piece to the whole ship's company. They said he was a trim built lad, too neat and delicate a piece of workmanship for the stormy sea. They laughed at his slender fingers, fitter to manage threads than ropes, passed many jokes upon his soft blue eyes and fair round cheeks, and in their rough language expressed Sir Toby's prayer, that “Jupiter in his next commodity of hair, would send the boy a beard.” In the main Will bore their jokes without flinching, and returned them with even measure, but sometimes when they verged to rudeness, his rising blush or a tear stealing from his downcast eye, expressed an instinctive and unsullied modesty, whose appeal touched the best feelings of these coarse men. The ship made a prosperous voyage, and in due time arrived off the American coast. It is a common custom with sailors to greet the first sight of land with a sacrifice to Bacchus. The natural and legalized revel was as extravagant on this, as it usually is on similar occasions. The captain with unwonted good humour, dealt out the liquor most liberally to the crew, and bade William sing them his best songs. Will obeyed, and song after song, and glass after glass carried them, as they said, far above high water mark. Their language and manners became intolerable to William, and he endeavoured to steal away with the intention of hiding himself in the cabin, till the revel was over. One of the sailors suspecting his design, caught him rudely and swore he would detain him in his arms. William struggled, freed himself, and darted down the companion way, the men following and shouting. The captain stood at the entrance of the cabin door. William sunk down at his feet terrified and exhausted, and screaming “protect me—oh! for the love of heaven, protect me.” The captain demanded the occasion of the uproar, and ordered the men to stand back. They, however, stimulated to reckless courage, and in sight of land and independence, no longer fearing his authority, swore that they would not be balked of their frolic. Poor Will, already feeling their hands upon him, clung in terror to the captain, and one fear overcoming another, confessed that his masculine dress was a disguise, and wringing his hands with shame and anguish, supplicated protection as a helpless girl. The sailors touched with remorse and pity, retreated; but the brutal captain spurned the trembling supplicant with his foot, swearing a round oath that it was the first time he had been imposed on, and it should be the last. Unfortunately the old man, priding himself on his sagacity, was as confident of his own infallibility as the most devoted Catholic is of the Pope's. This was his last voyage, and after playing Sir Oracle, for forty years—to have been palpably deceived—incontrovertibly outwitted by a girl of fifteen, was a mortification that his vanity could not brook. He swore he would have his revenge, and most strictly did he perform his vow. He possessed a plantation in the vicinity of Oxford; thither he conveyed the unhappy girl, and degraded her to the rank of a common servant, among the negro slaves in his kitchen. The captain's wrath was magnified, by the stranger's persisting in refusing to disclose the motive of her deception, to reveal her family, or even to tell her name. Her new acquaintance were at a loss what to call her, till the captain's daughter, who had been on a visit to Philadelphia, and seen the Winter's Tale performed there, bestowed on her the pretty appellative of Hermione's lost child, Perdita. The captain, a common case, was the severest sufferer by his own passions. His wife complained that his “venture,” as she provokingly styled poor Perdita, L 2 was a useless burden on her household—“a fine lady born and bred, and like feathers, and flowers, and all French goods, pretty to look at, but fit for no use in the world.” The captain's daughters, partly instigated by compassion, and partly by the striking contrast between the delicate graces of the stranger and their own buxom beauty, incessantly teased their father to send her back to her own country; and neighbours and acquaintances were forever letting fall some observation on the beauty of the girl, or some allusion to her story, that was as a spark of fire to the captain's gunpowder temper. Weeks and months rolled heavily on without a dawn of hope to poor Perdita. She was too young and inexperienced herself, to contrive any mode of relief, and no one was likely to undertake voluntarily the difficult enterprise of rescuing her from her thraldom. Her condition was thus forlorn, when her story came to the ears of Frank Stuart, a gallant young sailor on board the Hazard, a vessel lying in the stream off Oxford, and on the eve of sailing for Cowes in the Isle of Wight. Frank stood deservedly high in the confidence of his commander, and on Sunday, the day preceding that appointed for the departure of the ship, he obtained leave to go on shore. His youthful imagination was excited by the story of the oppressed stranger, and he strolled along the beach in the direction of her master's plantation, in the hope of gratifying his curiosity by a glimpse of her. As he approached the house, he perceived that the front blinds were closed, and inferring thence that the family were absent, he ventured within the bounds of the plantation, and saw at no great distance from him a young female sitting on a bench beneath a tree. She leaned her head against its trunk, with an air of dejectedness and abstraction, that encouraged the young man to hope he had already attained his object. As he approached nearer, the girl started from her musings, and would have retreated to the house, but suddenly inspired by her beauty and youth with a resolution to devote himself to her service, he besought her to stop for one instant and listen to him. She turned and gazed at him as if she would have perused his heart. Frankness and truth were written on his face by the finger of heaven. She could not fear any impertinence from him, and farther assured by his respectful manner, when he added, “I have something particular to say to you —but we must luff and bear away, for we are in too plain sight of the look out there,” and he pointed to the house—she smiled and followed him to a more secluded part of the grounds. As soon as he was sure of being beyond observation, “Do you wish,” he asked with professional directness, “to return to old England?” She could not speak, but she clasped her hands, and the tears gushed like an open fountain from her eyes—“you need not say any more—you need not say any more,” he exclaimed, for he felt every tear to be a word spoken to his heart—“If you will trust me,” he continued, “I swear, and so God help me as I speak the truth, I will treat you as if you were my sister. Our ship sails to-morrow morning at day light, make a tight bundle of your rigging, and meet me at twelve o'clock to-night at the gate of the plantation. Will you trust me?” “Heaven has sent you to me,” replied the poor girl, her face brightening with hope, “and I will trust you.” They then separated—Perdita to make her few preparations, and Frank to contrive the means of executing his romantic enterprize. Precisely at the appointed hour the parties met at the place of rendezvous. Perdita was better furnished for her voyage than could have been anticipated, from the durance she had suffered. A short notice and a scant wardrobe, were never known to oppose an obstacle to a heroine's compassing sea and land; but as we have dispensed with the facilities of fiction, we are bound to account for Perdita's being in possession of the necessaries of life, and it is due to the captain's daughter to state, that her feminine sympa thy had moved her from time to time to grant generous supplies to Perdita, which our heroine acknowledged on going away, by a letter enclosing a valuable ring. A few whispered sentences of caution, assurance, and gratitude, were reciprocated by Frank and Perdita, as they bent their hasty steps to the landing-place where he had left his boat; and when he had handed her into it, and pushed from the shore on to his own element, he felt the value of the trust which this beautiful young creature had reposed in him. Never in the days of knightly deeds was there a sentiment of purer chivalry, than that which inspired the determined resolution and romantic devotion of the young sailor. He was scarcely twenty, the age of fearless project, and self-confidence. How soon is the one checked by disappointments—the other humbled by experience of the infirmity of human virtue! Stuart had not confided his designs to any of his shipmates. He was therefore obliged warily to approach the ship, and to get on board with the least possible noise. He had just time to secrete Perdita amidst bales of tobacco, in the darkest place in the hold of the vessel, when a call of “all hands on deck,” summoned him to duty. He was foremost at his post, and all was stir and bustle to get the vessel under way. The sails were hoisted—the anchor weighed, and all in readiness, when a signal was heard from the shore, and presently a boat filled with men was seen approaching. The men proved to be Perdita's master, with a sheriff, and his attendants. They produced a warrant empowering them to search the vessel. The old captain affirmed that the girl had been seen on the preceding day, talking with a young spark, who was known to have come on shore from the Hazard. In his fury he foamed at the mouth, swore he would have the runaway dead or alive, and that her aider and abettor should be given over to condign punishment. The master of the Hazard declared, that if any of his men were found guilty, he would resign them to the dealings of land law, and to prove that if there were a plot, he was quite innocent, he not only freely abandoned his vessel to the search, but himself was most diligent in the inquest. The men were called up, confronted and examined; not one appeared more cool and unconcerned than Frank Stuart, and after every inquiry, after ransacking, as they believed, every possible place of concealment, the pursuers were compelled to withdraw, baffled and disappointed. The vessel proceeded on her voyage.—Frank requested the captain's permission to swing a hammock alongside his birth, on the pretence that the birth was rendered damp and unwholesome by a leak in the deck above it. This reasonable petition was of course granted, and when night had closed watchful eyes, and dropped her friendly veil, so essential to the clandestine enterprises of the most ingenious, Frank rescued Perdita from a position, in which she had suffered not only the inconveniences, but the terrors of an African slave; and wrapping her in his own dreadnought, and drawing his watchcap over her bright luxuriant hair, he conducted her past the open door of the captain's state-room, and past his sleeping companions, to his own birth; then whispering to her, “that she was as safe as a ship in harbour,” he gave her some bread and a glass of wine, for which he had bartered his allowance of spirits, and laid himself down in his own hammock, to the companionship of such thoughts as are ministering angels about the pillow of the virtuous. The following day a storm arose—a storm still remembered, as the most terrible and disastrous that ever occurred in Chesapeake Bay. There were several passengers of consequence on board the Hazard, among others two deacons who were going to the mother country to receive orders—for then, we of the colonies, who have since taken all rights into our own hands, dared not exercise the rights God had given us, without the assent of the Lords Bishops. Night came on, the storm increased, and then, when the ship was in extremity, when death howled in every blast, when “the timid shrieked and the brave stood still”—then was the unwearied activity, the exhaustless invention, and the unconquerable resolution of Frank Stuart, the last human support and help of the unhappy crew. The master of the Hazard was advanced in life, and unnerved by the usual feebleness and timidity of age. He had but just enough presence of mind left, to estimate the masterly conduct of young Stuart, and he abandoned the command of the vessel to him, and retired to what is too often only a last resource—to prayers with the churchmen. Once or twice Stuart disappeared from the deck, ran to whisper a word of encouragement to his trembling charge, and then returned with renewed vigour to his duty. Owing, under Providence, to his exertions, the Hazard rode out a storm which filled the seaman's annals with many a tale of terror. Gratitude is too apt to rest in second causes, in the visible means of deliverance, and perhaps an undue portion was now felt towards the intrepid youth. The passengers lavished their favours on him—they supplied his meals with the most delicate wines and fruits, and the choicest viands from their own stores; he, with the superstition characteristic of his profession, firmly believed that heaven had sent the storm to unlock their hearts to him, and thus afford him the means of furnishing Perdita with dainties suited to her delicate appetite so that she fared, as he afterwards boasted, like the daughter of a king in her father's palace. Stuart was kept in a state of perpetual alarm by the mate of the vessel. He knew that this fellow, one of those imbeciles that bend like a reed before a strong blast, had been hostile to him ever since the storm, when the accidental superiority of his station had been compelled to bow to Frank's superior genius. He was aware that the mate had, by malicious insinuations, estranged the captain from him, and he was but too certain that he should have nothing to hope, if his secret were discovered by this base man. Perhaps this apprehension gave him an air of unwonted constraint in the presence of his enemy; certain it is, the mate's eye often rested on him with an expression of eager watchfulness and suspicion, and Stuart, perceiving it, would contract his brow and compress his lips, in a way that betrayed how hard he strove with his rising passion. The difficulty of concealment was daily increasing, as one after another of his messmates, either from some inevitable accident, or from a communication becoming necessary on his part, obtained possession of his secret. But his ascendency over them was complete, and by threats or persuasions, he induced them all to promise inviolable secresy, There is an authority in a determined spirit, to which men naturally do homage. It is heaven's own charter of a power, to which none can refuse submission. Frank never permitted his comrades to approach Perdita, or to speak a word to her; but in the depths of the night, when the mate's and the old captain's senses were locked in sleep, he would bring her forth to breathe the fresh air. Seated on the gunwale, she would bestow on him the only reward in her gift— the treasures of her sweet voice; and Frank said the winds sat still in the sails to listen. There were times when not a human sound was heard in the ship, when these two beings, borne gently on by the tides in mid ocean, felt as if they were alone in the universe. It was at such times that Frank felt an irrepressible curiosity to know something more of the mysterious history of Perdita, whose destiny heaven, he believed, had committed to his honour; and once he ventured to introduce the topic nearest his heart, by saying, “you bade me call you Perdita, but I do not like the name; it puts me too much in mind of those rodomontade novels that turn the girls' heads and set them a sailing, as it were, without chart or compass, in quest of unknown worlds”—He hesitated; it was evident he had betaken himself to a figure, to avoid an explicit declaration of his wishes—after a moment's pause he added—“it suits me best to be plain-spoken—it is not the name that I object to so much, but—but hang it—I think you know Frank Stuart now, well enough to trust him with your real name.” The unhappy girl cast down her eyes, and said “that Perdita suited her better than any other name.” “Then you will not trust me?” “Say not so, my noble, generous friend,” she exclaimed—“trust you!—have I not trusted you!—you know that I would trust you with any thing that was my own—but my name—my father's name, I have forfeited by my folly.” “Oh no—that you shall not say—a brave ship is not run down with a light breeze, and a single folly of a young girl cannot sink a good name—a folly!” he continued, thus indirectly pushing his inquiries, “if it is a folly, it's a common one—there's many a stouter heart than your's, that's tried to face a gale of love, and been obliged to bear about and scud before the wind.” “Who told you?—how did you discover?” demanded Perdita, in a hurried, alarmed manner. Frank's generous temper disdained to surprise the unwary girl into confidence, and he immediately surrendered the advantage he had gained. “Nobody has told me,” he said, “I have discovered nothing—I only guessed, as the yankees say; now wipe away your tears—the sea wants no more salt water, and believe me, Frank Stuart has not such a woman's spirit in him, that he cannot rest content without knowing a secret.” In spite of Frank's manly resolution, he did afterwards repeatedly intimate the longings of his curiosity, but they were always met with such unaffected distress on the part of Perdita, that he said he had not the heart to press them. As the termination of the voyage approached, Stuart became more intensely anxious lest his secret should be discovered. The mildest consequence would be, that he should forfeit his wages. That he cared not for— like Goldsmith's poor soldier, he could lie on a bare board, and thank God he was so well off. “While he had youth and health,” he said, “and there was a ship afloat on the wide sea, he was provided for.” But his companions who had been true to him might forfeit their pay; for, by their fidelity to him, they had in some measure become his accessories. But he found consolation even under this apprehension; “the honest lads,” he said, “would soon make a full purse empty, but the memory of a good action was a treasure gold could not buy—a treasure that would stick by them forever—a treasure for the port of heaven.” There was, however, one apprehended evil, for which his philosophy offered no antidote. He was sure the captain would deem it his duty or M make it his will, (even Frank's slight knowledge of human nature told him that will and duty were too often convertible terms,) to return the fugitive to her self-styled master in Maryland. Nothing could exceed the vigilance with which he watched every movement and turn that threatened a detection, or the ingenuity with which he evaded every circumstance that tended to it—but alas! the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. One night when it was blowing a gale, a particular rope was wanted, which the mate remembered to have stowed away in the steerage. Frank eagerly offered to search for it, but the mate was certain that no one but himself could find it, and taking a lantern he went in quest of it. Frank followed him with fear and trembling. He has since been in many a desperate sea-fight, but he declares he never felt so much like a coward as at that moment. The mate's irritable humour had been somewhat stirred by Frank's persisting in his offer to go for the rope, and when he turned and saw him at his heels, he asked him angrily, “what he was dogging him for?” “The ship rolls so heavily,” replied Frank, in a subdued tone, “that I thought you might want me to hold the lantern for you.” Frank's unwonted meekness conciliated the mate, and though he rejoined, “I think I have been used to the rolling of a ship a little longer than you, young man,” he spoke good-naturedly, and Frank ventured to proceed. Most fortunately, as Frank thought, the mate directed his steps to the side of the ship opposite Perdita, but making a little circuit in his return, he passed between Frank's hammock and Perdita's birth. At this moment the poor lad's heart, as he afterwards averred, stopped beating. The ship rolled on that side, and the mate catching hold of the birth to save himself from falling, exclaimed, “What lazy devil is here, when every hand is wanted on deck;” and raising his lantern to identify the supposed delinquent sailor, he discovered the beautiful girl. For a moment he was dumb with amazement, but soon recalling the search at Oxford, the whole truth flashed upon him: he turned to Frank, and shaking his fist in his face, “Ah, this is you, Stuart!” he said, and enforced his gesture with a horrible oath. “Yes,” retorted Frank, now standing boldly forth, “it is me, thank God”—and then drawing a curtain that he had arranged before Perdita's birth, he bade her fear nothing. “Oh, Frank,” she exclaimed, “I cannot fear where you are.” This involuntary expression of confidence went to her protector's heart. There is no man so dead to sentiment, as not to be touched by the trust of woman, especially if she be young and beautiful. Frank was at the age when sentiment is absolute, and he was resolved to secure his treasure at every hazard. Perdita's declaration, while it stimulated his zeal, awakened the mean jealousies of the mate. “And so, my pretty miss,” he said, “you fear nothing where this fellow is—I can tell you, for all that he may boast, and you may believe, he is neither master nor mate yet, and please the Lord I'll prove as much to him this very night.” “And how will you prove it?” asked Stuart, in a voice which, though as calm as he could make it, resembled the low growl of a bull dog before he springs on his victim. “I'll prove it, my lad, by telling the whole story of your smuggled goods to the captain. A pretty piece of work this, to be carried on under the nose of your officers. It's no better than a mutiny, for I'll warrant it the whole ship's crew are leagued with you.” Stuart reined in his passions, and condescended to expostulate. He represented to the mate that he could gain nothing by giving information to the captain. He described, with his simple eloquence, the oppression the poor girl had already suffered; the cruelty of disappointing her present hopes, just as they were on the point of being realized, for the ship was not more than twenty-four hours' sail from Cowes; he appealed to his compassion, his generosity, his manliness, but in vain, he found no accessible point. The mean pride of having discovered the secret, and the pleasure of humbling Stuart, mastered every good feeling of the mate, if indeed he possessed any, and he turned away, saying, with a sort of chuckling exultation, “that he should go and do his duty.” “Stop,” cried Frank, grasping his arm with a gripe that threatened to crush it. “Stop, and hear me; I swear by Him that made me, if you dare so much as to hint by word, look or movement, the secret you have discovered here, you shall not cumber the earth another day—day—said I—no not an hour—I'll send you to the devil as swift as a canon ball ever went to the mark—Look,” he continued, tearing away the curtain he had just drawn before Perdita—“could any thing short of the malice of Satan himself contrive to harm such helpless innocence as that—do you hear me”—he added, in a voice that outroared the storm —“in God's name look at me, and see I am in earnest.” The mate had no doubt to satisfy, he trembled like an aspen leaf—in vain he essayed to raise his eyes; the passion that glared in Frank's face, and dilated his whole figure, affected the trembling wretch like a stroke of the sun. He reeled like a drunken man. His abject fear changed Stuart's wrath to contempt, and giving him an impulse that sent him quite out of the door, he returned to soothe Perdita with the assurance that they had nothing to fear from the “cowardly dog.” She was confounded with terror, but much more frightened by the vehemence of Stuart's passion than by the threats of the mate. She had always seen her protector move like an unobstructed stream along its course, in calm and silent power. Now he was the torrent, that no human force could oppose or direct. She saw before her calamities far worse than any she had endured. She believed that the mate, as soon as he was recovered from his paroxysm of terror, would communicate his discovery. She apprehended the most fatal issue from Frank's threats and determined resolution, and the possibility that his generous zeal for her might involve him in crime, was intolerable to her. Such thoughts do not become less terrible by solitary meditation—in the solemnity of night and amidst the howlings of a storm. Every blast spoke reproach and warning to Perdita, and tortured by those harpies remorse and fear, she took a sudden resolution to reveal herself to the captain, feeling at the moment that if she warded off evil from her protector, she could patiently abide the worst consequences to herself. She sprang from her birth as if afraid of being checked by a second thought, and rushed from the steerage to the cabin. All was perfect stillness there—the passengers had retired to their beds. The captain was sitting by the table, he had been reading, but his book had fallen to the floor, his head had sunk on his breast, and he was in a profound sleep. The light shone full on his weather-beaten face—on large uncouth features—on lines deepened to furrows—and muscles stiffened by time. Never was there an aspect more discouraging to one who needed mercy, and poor Perdita stood trembling before him and close to him, and dared not, could not speak. She heard a footstep-approaching, still her tongue was glued to the roof of her mouth. Then she heard her name pronounced in a low whisper at the cabin door, and turning, she saw Stuart there beckoning most earnestly to her. She shook her head, signed to him to withdraw, and laid her hand on the captain's shoulder. There M 2 was but one way to thwart her intentions, and Frank's was not a hesitating spirit, he sprang forward, caught her in his arms, and before the old man had rubbed his eyes fairly open, Perdita was again safe in the steerage. Stuart's threats produced the intended effect on the mate; he was completely intimidated. He scarcely ventured out of Frank's sight lest he should incur his dangerous suspicions, and the next day the vessel, accelerated by the gale of the preceding evening, arrived at Cowes. The captain and mate immediately landed, and Stuart, no longer embarrassed by their presence, was able to take the necessary measures for Perdita. She assured him that if once conveyed to the main land, to Portsmonth or Southampton, she could herself take the coach for London, and there, she said happiness or misery awaited her which her noble protector could neither promote or avert. A wherry was procured. Before Perdita was transferred to it, she took leave of all the sailors, shook hands with each of them, and expressed to them, individually, her gratitude and good wishes. Her words conveyed nothing but a sense of obligation, but there was something of condescension in her manner, and much of the grace of high station that contrasted strikingly with the abased, fearful, and shrinking air of the girl who had, till then, only been seen gliding like a spectre along the deck, attended by Stuart, and veiled by the shadows of night. As the wherry parted from the ship, she bowed her head and waved her handkerchief to Frank's shipmates, and they returned her salutation with three loud cheers. Stuart attended her to an inn at Portsmouth, engaged for her a seat in the London coach, and then followed her to a private apartment which he had secured, to bid her farewell. Perdita, from the moment she had felt her emancipation from a degrading condition, and the joy of setting her foot again on her native land, had manifested, perhaps, an undue elation of spirits, an elation so opposite to Frank's feelings, that to him it was a grating discord; but when she saw him for the last time, every other emotion gave place to unfeigned sorrow and inexpressible gratitude. Stuart laid a purse on the table beside her. “My shipmates,” he said, “receive their wages to-morrow, so they have been right glad to make their pockets clear of the little trash that was in them, which may be of service to you, though it is of no use to them.” “Oh Frank!” she exclaimed, “if I should ever have any thing in my gift—if I could but reward you for all you have done for me!” All the blood in Frank's heart rushed to his face, and he said in a voice almost inarticulate with offended pride, “there are services that money cannot buy, and thank God, there are feelings in a poor man's breast worth more than all the gold in the king's coffers.” “What have I said,” exclaimed Perdita, “I would rather die—rather return to the depth of misery from which you rescued me—yes, ten times told, than to speak one word that should offend you—you to whom I owe every thing—my life—and more than life. I did not say—I did not think, that money could reward you.” “Do not speak that word again,” said Frank, half ashamed of his pride, and half glorifying in it. “Reward! I want none but your safety and the blessed memory of having done my duty. Money—ho! I care no more for it, than for the dust I tread upon.” I know it—I am sure of it,” cried Perdita, humbled for the moment by a sense of an elevation of soul in Frank, that exalted him far above any accidents of birth or education. “Frank, you are rich in every thing that is good and noble—and what am I, to talk of reward—poor—poor in every thing but gratitude to you, Frank—I am not poor in that—you must not then despise me, and you will not forget me—and you will keep this ring for my sake.” Frank took the ring, and the lily hand she extended to him—his tears fell fast upon it—he struggled for a moment with his feelings, then dashed away his tears, and half-articulating “God bless you!” he hurried out of the apartment. Thus separating himself from the beautiful young creature, for whom he had performed a most difficult service with religious fidelity; and of whose name even, he was forever to remain in ignorance. The enterprising talent of Stuart ensured its appropriate reward. In one year from the memorable voyage above related, he commanded a vessel; and on the breaking out of the revolutionary war, he devoted himself to his country's cause, with the fervent zeal which characterised and consecrated that cause—which made the common interest a matter of feeling—a family affair to each individual. Stuart commanded an armed merchantman, and disputes with the noted Paul Jones the honour of having first struck down the British flag. However this may be, he was distinguished for his skill and intrepidity —and above all, (and this distinction endures when the most brilliant achievements have become insignificant,) for his humanity to those whom the fortune of war cast in his power. While on a cruise off the West Indies, Stuart intercepted an enemy's ship bound to Antigua. His adversary was far superior to him in men and guns, but as it did not comport with Stuart's bold spirit to make any very nice calculations of an enemy's superiority, he prepared without hesitation for action. The contest was a very severe one, and the victory long doubtful; but at last the British captain struck his colours. Though we certainly are disposed to render all honour to the skill of our hero, yet we dare not claim for him the whole merit of his success, but rather solve the mystery of victory at such odds, by quoting the expression of a patriotic English boy, who said on a similar occasion—“Ah, but the Americans would not have beaten, if the Lord had not been on their side.” After the fight the English commander requested an interview with captain Stuart; he informed him that the wife and mother of the governor of Antigua were on board his vessel, and that they were almost distracted with terror; he entreated therefore that they might be received with the humanity which their sex demanded, and the deference always due to high station. Stuart replied, “that as to high station, he held that all God's creatures, who feared their Creator and did their duty, were on a dead level—and as to the duties of humanity, he trusted no American captain need go further than his own heart for instructions how to perform them.” The British captain, ignorant of the spirit of the times, and arguing nothing favourable from Stuart's republican reply, returned with a heavy heart to the ladies to conduct them on board the captor's ship. The elder lady, the mother, was a woman of rank, with all the pride and prejudice of high birth. The Americans she deemed all of that then much despised order—the common people; rebels and robbers were the best names she bestowed on them, and in the honesty of her ignorance she sincerely believed that she had fallen into the hands of pirates. The younger lady, though deeply affected by their disastrous situation, endeavoured to calm her mother's apprehensions, and assured her that she had heard there were men of distinguished humanity among the American sailors. The old lady shook her head incredulously. “Oh heaven help us,” she groaned, “what can we expect from such horrid fellows, when they know they have lady Strangford and the right honourable Mrs. Liston in their power—and your beauty, Selina! your beauty, child! it is a fatal treasure to fall among thieves with—depend on't—arrange your veil so that it will hang in thick folds over your face—I will draw my hood close.” The precauton on her part seemed quite superfluous, but the young lady's impervious veil concealed a treasure of beauty which time had perfected but not impaired. The servants were ordered to deliver the ladies' baggage to the American captain, with a request that some necessaries might be reserved. Stuart answered that he interfered with no private property, and that all the baggage of the ladies remained at their disposal. Lady Strangford was somewhat reassured by this generosity, and attended by her captain and followed by her daughter and servants, she proceeded to Stuart's ship. Stuart advanced to meet them and offered her his hand—she proudly declined it and passed silently on. A gust of wind blew back her hood— “Faith!” exclaimed one of the sailors who observed the scrupulosity with which she replaced it, “the old lady had best show her face, for I'm sure we'll all give a good berth to such an iron-bound coast as that.” But as the same breeze blew aside the young lady's veil, there was a general murmur of admiration. She had at the moment graciously accepted the tender of Stuart's hand, in the hope of counteracting the impression of her mother's rudeness, and when her veil was removed he had a full view of her face; conscious that many were gazing on her, she blushed deeply, and hastily readjusted it without raising her eyes. Stuart dropped her hand—smothered an exclamation, and retreated a few paces, leaving her to follow her mother alone. One of his officers observing his emotion, said, “How is this, captain? yot don't wink at a broadside, and yet you start at one flash from a lady's bright face.” “I got a scratch on my right arm in the engagement,” returned Stuart, evading the raillery, “and I felt a devil of a twinge just then.” It was not a trifle that made honest Stuart thus “falter in a double sense.” He then retired to his state-room, and wrote the following note, which he directed to be delivered to the young lady. “Captain Stuart's compliments to the ladies under his protection—he incloses a ring, once bestowed on him in acknowledgment of honourable conduct, as a pledge to them that the hand that has worn such a badge shall never be sullied by a bad deed. Captain Stuart will proceed immediately to Antigua, conveying the ladies with the least possible delay to their destined port.” Such a communication to prisoners of war, might naturally excite emotion in a generous bosom, but it did not account for the excess of it manifested by the young lady. She became pale and faint, and when her mother, alarmed at such a demonstration of feeling, took up the note, she caught it from her, and then, after a second thought, relinquished it. “I see nothing in this, Selina,” said the old lady, after perusing and reperusing it, “to throw you into such a flurry, but you are young, and are thinking no doubt of getting home to your husband and children; young people's feelings, are, like soft wax, easily melted.” “There is a warmth in some kindness,” rejoined the daughter earnestly, “that ought to melt the hardest substance.” “Really, I do not see any thing so very striking in this man's civility. It would be, of course, you know in the British navy; politeness, and all that sort of thing being inborn in an Englishman, but it may be, indeed I fancy it is, quite unheard of in an American.” “Shall I write our acknowledgments, madam, to captain Stuart?” asked the young lady, with evident solicitude to drop the conversation. “Certainly—certainly, my dear Selina, always be ceremoniously polite with your inferiors.” “Madam, I think this noble captain,” she would have added, “has no superiors,” but afraid of further discussion, she concluded her sentence with the tame addition, “richly deserves our thanks.” She then wrote the following note. “Mrs. Liston, in behalf of her mother in law, lady Strangford, and on her own part, offers her warmest thanks to captain Stuart—the ladies esteem it heaven's peculiar mercy that captain Stuart is their captor. They have already had such experience of his magnanimity, as to render them perfectly tranquil in reposing their safety and happiness on his honour.” The ring, without any allusion to it, was reinclosed. When captain Stuart had perused the note, he inquired if the lady had not requested to speak with him. He was answered that so far from intimating such a wish, she had said to her mother that she would remain in her state-room, till she was summoned to leave captain Stuart's vessel. The captain looked extremely chagrined, he knit his brows, and bit his lips, and gave his orders hastily, with the usual sea expletives appended to them—“a sure sign,” his men said, “that something went wrong with their captain,” but these signs of repressed emotion were all the expression he allowed to his offended pride, or perhaps his better feelings. The ladies were scrupulously served, and every deferential attention paid to them that lady Strangford would have anticipated in the best disciplined ship in his majesty's service. A few day's sail brought the schooner to the port of Antigua. She entered the harbour under a flag of truce, and remained there just time enough for the disembarcation of the ladies and their suite. During this ceremony the captain remained in his berth, under pretext of a violent head-ache; but it was obseved that they were no sooner fairly off than he was on deck again, moving about with an activity and even impetuosity that seemed quite incompatible with a debilitating malady. Captain Stuart continued for some months a fortunate cruise about the West India islands. His was not the prudent maxim that “discretion is the better part of valour,” but when valour would have been bootless he knew how to employ the alternative, and his little schooner was celebrated as the most desperate fighter and the swiftest sailor in those seas, and her captain became so formidable, that the English admiral off that station gave orders that the schooner should be followed and destroyed at all hazards. Soon after this he was pursued by a ship of the line, and compelled to take refuge in the harbour of St. Kitts, a French, and of course a friendly port to the American flag. Here he anchored his vessel, and deeming himself perfectly secure, and wearied with hard duty, he retired to his berth after setting a watch, and dismissing his crew to repose. In the middle of the night he was alarmed by an attack from the pursuing frigate, which had contrived to elude the vigilance of the fort that guarded the entrance of the harbour, and was already in such a position in relation to him as to cut off every possibility of escape. His spirit, far from quailing, was exasperated by the surprise. He fought as the most courageous animals fight at bay. To increase the horror of his situation, the commander of the fort, from some fatal mistake, opened a fire upon him. He was boarded on all sides by boats manned with eighty-four men. We are too ignorant of such matters, to give any interest to the particulars of a sea-fight. Suffice it to say, that our N hero did not surrender till he was himself disabled by wounds, his little band cut down, and his schooner a wreck. When the British commander ascertained the actual force with which he had contended, his pride was stung with the consciousness that a victory so dearly bought, had all of defeat but the disgraceful name; and, incapable of that sympathy which a magnanimous spirit always feels with a noble captive, he arraigned captain Stuart before him as a criminal, and demanded of him how he dared against the law of nations, to defend an indefensible vessel. “Did you think,” retorted Stuart with cold contempt, “that I had gunpowder and would not burn it? do you talk to me of the law of nations! I fight after the law of nature, that teaches me to spend the last kernel of powder and the last drop of blood, in my country's service.” His conqueror's temper, heated before, was inflamed by Stuart's reply. He ordered him to be manacled and put into close confinement. This conduct may appear extraordinary in the commander of a British frigate, but the English, in their contest with the colonies were not always governed by those generous principles, by which they have themselves so much alleviated the miseries of war. A defeated American was treated as a lawful enemy, or a rebel, as suited the temper of the individual who vanquished him. The frigate was so much injured in the fight as to render a refit necessary, and her commander sailed with his prize for Antigua. Stuart well knew that his fidelity to his country rendered him obnoxious to the severest judgment from the admiralty court, and though he might plead the services he had rendered the ladies of the governor's family in mitigation of his sentence, he proudly resolved never to advert to favours, which he had reason to believe had been lightly estimated. Spirits most magnanimous in prosperity are often most lofty in adversity. Frank Stuart, mutilated by wounds, dejected by the fatal calamities of his faithful crew, irritated by the indignities heaped on him by his unworthy captor, and stung by secret thoughts of some real or fancied injury—chafed and overburthened with many griefs, received, and sullenly obeyed a summons to the presence of the governor. It cannot be denied, that reluctantly as he appeared before the governor, he surveyed him at his introduction with a look of keen curiosity. He was surprised to see a man rather past his prime, though not yet declined into the vale of years. With generous allowance for the effect of a tropical climate, he might not have been more than forty-five. His physiognomy was agreeable, and his deportment gentlemanly. He received captain Stuart with far more courtesy than was often vouchsafed from an officer of the crown, to one who fought under the rebel banner, and remarking that he looked pale and sick, he begged him to be seated. Stuart declined the civility, and continued resting on a crutch, which a severe wound in his leg rendered necessary. “You are the commander of the schooner Betsy?” said the governor. “What's left of her,” returned Stuart. “You appear to be severely wounded,” continued the governor. “Hacked to pieces,” rejoined Stuart, in a manner suited to the brevity of his reply. “Your name, I believe, is Frank Stuart?” “I have no reason to deny the name, thank God.” “And, thank God, I have reason to bless and honour it,” exclaimed the governor, advancing and grasping Frank's hand heartily. “What metal did you deem me of, my noble friend, that I should forget such favours as you conferred on me, in the persons of my wife and mother.” “I have known greater favours than those forgotten,” said Frank, and the sudden illumination of his pale face showed how deeply he felt what he uttered. “Say you so?” exclaimed the governor with good humoured warmth; “well, but that I am too poor to pay my own debts to you, I should count it a pleasure to assume those of all my species—but heaven grant, my friend, that you do not allude to my wife and mother. I blamed them much for not bringing you on shore with them—but my mother is somewhat over punctilious, and my wife, poor soul! her nerves were so shattered by that sea-fight, that she is but now herself again. On my word, so far from wanting gratitude to you, she never hears an allusion to you without tears, the language women deal in when words are too cold for them. But come,” concluded the governor, for he found that all his efforts did but add to Stuart's evident distress, “come, follow me to the drawing-room, the ladies will themselves convince you how impatient they have been to welcome you?” “Are they apprised,” asked Stuart, still hesitating and holding back, “whom they are to see?” “That are they—my mother is as much delighted as if his majesty were in waiting, and my wife is weeping with joy.” “Perhaps,” said Stuart, still hesitating, “she would rather not see me now.” “Nonsense, my good friend, come along. It is not for a brave fellow like you to shrink from a few friendly tears from a woman's eye.” Nothing more could be urged, and Stuart followed governor Liston to the presence of the ladies. Lady Strangford rose and offered him her hand with the most condescending kindness. Mrs. Liston rose too, but did not advance till her husband said, “Come, Selina, speak your welcome to our benefactor—he may misinterpret this expression of your feelings.” “Oh no,” she said, now advancing eagerly, and fixing her eye on Stuart, while her cheeks, neck, and brow were suffused with crimson, “Oh no, captain Stuart knows how deeply I must feel benefits, which none but he that bestowed them could forget or undervalue.” “It was a rule my mother taught me,” replied Frank with bluntness, softened however by a sudden gleam of pleasure, “that givers should not have better memories than receivers.” There was a meaning in his honest phrase hidden from two of his auditors, but quite intelligible to her for whom it was designed, and to our readers, who have doubtless already anticipated that the honourable Mrs. Liston was none other than the fugitive Perdita. A sudden change of colour showed that she felt acutely Stuart's keen though veiled reproach. “A benefit,” she replied, still speaking in a double sense, “such as I have received from you, captain Stuart, may be too deeply felt to be acknowledged by words—now heaven has given us the opportunity of deeds, and you shall find that my gratitude is only inferior to your merit.” Stuart was more accustomed to embody his feelings in action than speech, and he remained silent. He felt as if he were the sport of a dream, when he looked on the transformed Perdita. He knew not why, but invested as she now was, with all the power of wealth and the elegance of fashion, he felt not half the awe of her, as when in her helplessness and dependence, “he had fenced her rounde with many a spelle,” wrought by youthful and chivalric feeling. He perceived, in spite of Mrs. Liston's efforts, that his presence was embarrassing to her, and he would have taken leave, but the governor insisted peremptorily on his remaining to dine with him. Then saying that he had indispensable business to transact, and must be absent for a half hour, he would, he said, N 2 “leave the ladies to the free expression of their feelings.” When he was gone, Mrs. Liston said to her mother, “I do not think your little favourite, Francis, is quite well to-day—will you have the goodness to look in upon him and give nurse some advice.” The old lady went without reluctance, as most people do to give advice, and Mrs. Liston turned to Stuart, and said, “I gave my boy your name, with a prayer that God would give him your spirit. Do not, oh do not think me,” she continued, her lip quivering with emotion, “the ungrateful wretch I have appeared. I am condemned to silence by the pride of another. My heart rebels, but I am bound to keep that a secret, which my feelings prompt me to publish to the world.” Stuart would have spoken, but she anticipated him: “Listen to me without interruption,” she said, “my story is my only apology, and I have but brief space to tell it in. It was love, as you once guessed, that led me to that mad voyage to America. I had a silly passion for a young Virginian, who had been sent to England for his education—he was nineteen, I fifteen, when we promised to meet on board the ship which conveyed me to America. His purpose, but not his concert with me was discovered, and he was detained in England. You know all the events of my enterprise. I left a letter for my father, informing him that I had determined to abandon England, but I gave him not the slightest clue to my real designs. I was an only, and as you will readily believe, a spoiled child. My mother was not living, and my father hoping that I should soon return, and wishing to veil my folly, gave out that he had sent me to a boarding-school on the continent, and himself retired to Switzerland. When I arrived in London, I obtained his address and followed him. He immediately received me to apparent favour, but never restored me to his confidence. His heart was hardened by my childish folly, and though I recounted to him all my sufferings, I never drew a tear from him; but when I spoke of you, and dwelt on the particulars of your goodness to me, his eye would moisten, and he would exclaim, `God bless the lad.' I must be brief,” she continued, casting her eye apprehensively at the door; “Mr. Liston came with his mother to Geneva, where we resided; he addressed me—my father favoured his suit, and though he is, as you perceive, much older than myself, I consented to marry him, but not, as I told my father, till I had unfolded my history to him. My father was incensed at what he called my folly—he treated me harshly—I was subdued, and our contest ended in my solemnly swearing never to divulge the secret, on the preservation of which he fancied the honour of his proud name to depend.” “Thank God,” then exclaimed Frank, with a burst of honest feeling, “it was not your pride, cursed pride; and I may still think on Perdita as a true, tender-hearted girl. It was a pleasant spot in my memory,” he continued, dashing away a tear, “and I hated to have it crossed with a black line.” Mrs. Liston improved all that remained of her mother's absence in detailing some particulars, not necessary to relate, by which it appeared that notwithstanding she had dispensed with the article of love in her marriage, (we crave mercy of our fair young readers,) her husband's virtue and indulgence had matured a sentiment of affection, if not as romantic, yet quite as safe and enduring as youthful passion. She assured Stuart that she regarded him as the means of all her happiness. “Not a day passes,” she said, raising her beautiful eyes to heaven, “that I do not remember my generous deliverer, where alone I am permitted to speak of him.” The old lady now rejoined them, bringing her grandchild in her arms. Frank threw down his crutch, forgot his wounds, and permitted his full heart to flow out, in the caresses he lavished on his little namesake. The governor redeemed Stuart's schooner, and made such representations before the admiralty court of Stuart's merits, and of the ill treatment he had received from the commander of the frigate, that the court ordered the schooner to be refitted and equipped, and permitted to proceed to sea at the pleasure of captain Stuart. He remained for several days domesticated in the governor's family, and treated by every member of it with a frank cordiality suited to his temper and merits. Every look, word, and action of Mrs. Liston expressed to him, that his singular service was engraven on her heart. He forebore even to allude to it, and with his characteristic magnanimity never inquired, directly or indirectly, her family name. He observed a timidity and apprehensiveness in her manner that resulted from a consciousness that she had, however reluctantly, practised a fraud on her husband, and he said “that having felt how burdensome it was to keep a secret from his commander for a short voyage, he thought it was quite too heavy a lading for the voyage of life.” The demonstrations of gratitude which Stuart received from governor Liston and his family, he deemed out of all proportion to his services, and being more accustomed to bestow than to receive, he became restless, and as soon as his schooner was ready for sea, he announced his departure, and bade his friends farewell. He said the tears that Perdita, (he always called her Perdita,) shed at parting, were far more precious to him than all the rich gifts she had bestowed on him. At the moment Stuart set his foot on the deck of his vessel, the American colours, at the governor's command, were hoisted. The generous sympathies of the multitude were moved, and huzzas from a thousand voices rent the air. Governor Liston and his suite and most of the merchant vessels, then in port, escorted the schooner out of the harbour. Even the stern usages of war cannot extinguish that sentiment in the bosom of man, implanted by God, which leads him to do homage to a brave and generous foe. Captain Stuart continued to the end of the war, to serve his country with unabated zeal, and, when peace was restored, the same hardy spirit that had distinguished him in perilous times, made him foremost in bold adventure. He commanded the second American trading vessel that arrived at Canton after the peace; and this vessel with which he sailed over half the globe, was a sloop of eighty tons, little more than half the size of the largest now used for the trade of Hudson river. This adventure will be highly estimated by those who have been so fortunate as to read the merry tale of Dolph Heilegher, and who remember the prudence manifested, at that period, by the wary Dutchmen in navigating these small vessels: how they were fain to shelter themselves at night in the friendly harbours with which the river abounds, and, we believe, to avoid adventuring through Haverstraw bay or the Tappan sea, in a high wind. When Stuart's little sloop rode into the port of Canton, it was mistaken for a tender from a large ship, and the bold mariner was afterwards familiarly called by the great Hong merchants, “the one-mast captain.” Fifty-seven years have gone by since the Hazard sailed from Oxford, and our hero is now enjoying in the winter of his life, the fruits of a summer of activity and integrity. Time, which he has well used, has used him gently—his hair is a little thinned and mottled, but is still a sufficient shelter to his honoured head. His eye when he talks of the past, (all good old men love to talk of the past,) rekindles with the fire of youth, his healthful complexion speaks his temperance, and a double row of unimpared ivory, justifies the pleasant vanity of his boast, that he can still show his teeth to an enemy. Professional carelessness or generosity has left him little of the world's “gear,” but he is rich—for he is independent of riches. He says he would recommend honest dealings and an open hand, to all who would lay up stores of pleasant thoughts for their old age; and he avers—and who will gainsay him? that in the silent watches of the night, the memory of money well bestowed is better than a pocket full of guineas. He loves to recount his boyish pranks, and recal his childish feelings—how he rattled down the chincapins on the devoted heads of a troop of little girls; and how he was whipped for crying to go with Braddock and be a soldier! but above all, he loves to dwell on some of the particulars we have related, and in the sincerity of religious feeling to ascribe praise to that Being, who kept his youth within the narrow bound of strict virtue. I saw him last week surrounded by his grandchildren, recounting his imminent dangers and hair breadth 'scapes to a favourite boy, while the nimble fingers of rosy-cheeked, bright-eyed little girls were employed in making sails for a miniature ship, which the old man has just completed. Long may he enjoy the talisman that recalls to his imagination, labour without its hardship, and enterprise without its failure—and God grant gentle breezes and a clear sky to the close of his voyage of life!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MARY DYRE. The subject of the following sketch, a Quaker Martyr, may appear to the fair holiday readers of souvenirs, a very unfit personage to be introduced into the romantic and glorious company of lords and ladye loves; of doomed brides; and all-achieving heroines; chivalric soldiers; suffering outlaws; and Ossianic sons of the forest. But of such, it is not now “our hint to speak.” Neither have we selected the most romantic heroine that might have been found in the annals of the sober-suited sect. A startling tale might be wrought from the perilous adventures of Mary Fisher, the maiden missionary, who, after being cast into prison, for saying “thee” instead of “you,” was examined before a judicial tribunal, and “nothing found but innocence;” who, released from durance, travelled over the continent of Europe, to communicate her faith; visited the court of Mahomet the Fourth, then held at Adrianople; was presented by the Grand Vizier to the Sultan, who listened to her with deference, and was, or affected to be, persuaded of her truth. A guard to Constantinople was gallantly offered her by Mahomet, which she refused; and safe and unmolested, in her armous of innocence, she proceeded to that city, receiving everywhere from the Turks the gentle usage that was denied her by those professing a more generous faith. A tale of horrors, of cowled monks, and instruments of torture, might be framed from the “hair breadth scapes” of Catharine Evans and Sarah Chevers, the Quaker heroines who suffered with constancy, in the Inquisition at Malta. We have passed by these tempting themes, to tell a briefer story, and present a character in its true and natural light, as it stands on the historic page, without the graces of fiction, or any of those aids, by which the romance writer composes his picture—exaggerating beauties, placing them in bright lights, and omitting or gracefully shading defects. There are manifestations of moral beauty so perfect that they do not require the aids of fiction, as there are scenes in the material world, that no illusion of the imagination can improve. Mary Dyre belonged to the religious society of “Friends;” a society, that, after having long resisted the tempest of intolerance and persecution, is melting away under the genial sun of universal toleration, and the ignoble, but no less resistless influence, of the tailor's shears, and the milliner's craft. As Voltaire predicted, some sixty years since, “Les enfans enrichis par l'industrie de leurs peres veulent jouir avoir des honneurs, des boutons, et des manchettes.” Mary Dyre was among those, who, in 1657, sought in New England an asylum from the oppression of the mother country. But the persecuted had become persecutors; and, instead of an asylum, these harmless people found a prison, and were destined, for their glory and our shame, to suffer as martyrs in the cause of liberty of conscience. Sewal, the historian “of the people called Quakers,” to whom we are indebted for most of the following particulars, has given very slight notice of Mary Dyre's private history. “She was,” he says, “of a comely and grave countenance, of a good family and estate, and the mother of several children; but her husband, it seems, was of another persuasion.” From another document, which we have been so fortunate as to obtain, it appears that this defect of religious sympathy, O had, in no degree, abated the affection and confidence of her husband. Thus she possessed whatever comes within the aspiration of a woman's ambition or affections;—beauty, for this is no violent paraphrase of the Quaker historian's stinted courtesy, rank, fortune, conjugal and maternal happiness; yet she counted all these but loss, believing that her obedience to the inspirations of God required their sacrifice. The Pilgrims, finding the penalties of fine, imprisonment, scourging with the “three-corded whip,” cutting off the ears, and boring the tongue with a red-hot iron, ineffectual in extirpating the “cursed heresy of the Quakers,” or “preventing their pestilent errors and practices,” proceeded to banish them from their jurisdiction, on pain of death. This violence was done under a statute enacted in 1658. Mary Dyre, with many others, sought a refuge from the storm in Rhode-Island. Christian liberty, in its most generous sense, was the noble distinction of that Province; and there Mary might have enjoyed her inoffensive faith, and all the temporal distinctions it permitted, for her husband filled one of the highest offices in the Province. But she could not forget her suffering brethren in the Massachusetts Colony. She meditated on their wrongs till she “felt a call” to return to Boston. Two persons, distinguished for zeal and integrity, accompanied her; William Robinson, and Marmaduke Stevenson. Their intention and hope was, to obtain a repeal or mitigation of the laws against their sect. Their return was in the autumn of 1659. On their appearance in Boston, they were immediately seized, and committed to prison, and a few days subsequent, after a summary and informal examination before Governor Endicot, and the associate Magistrates, they were sentenced to suffer the penalty of death, which had been already decreed to such as, after being banished, should return. Mary's companions replied to the annunciation of their sentence, in terms that savoured strongly of human resentment, which, alas for human weakness! is often betrayed in the anticipation of the judgments of Heaven. “Give ear, ye magistrates,” said Stevenson, “and all ye who are guilty, for this the Lord hath said concerning you, and will perform his word upon you, that the same day ye put his servants to death, shall the day of your visitation pass over you, and ye shall be cursed forevermore.” The passions of our infirm nature are sometimes confounded with the religion that accompanies them, as the cloud is, to an ignorant eye, identified with the prismatic rays it reflects. Mary's pure and gentle spirit dwelt in eternal sunshine; its elements were at peace. When the fearful words were pronounced, “Mary Dyre, you shall go to the prison whence you came, thence to the place of execution, and be hanged there till you are dead,” she folded her hands, and replied, with a serene aspect, “The will of the Lord be done.” Her friends have described her demeanour at this moment, as almost supernatural, as if the outward temple were brightened by the communications of the Spirit within. They say, the world seemed to have vanished from her sight; her eyes were raised, and fixed in the rapture of devotion; her lips were moved by the ecstasy of her soul, though they uttered no articulate sound. Governor Endicot seems to have felt an irritation at her tranquillity, not more dignified than a child's when he vents his wrath in blows on an insensible substance. “Take her away, Marshal,” he said harshly. “I return joyfully to my prison,” she replied; and then turning to the Marshal, she added, “You may leave me, Marshal, I will return alone.” “I believe you, Mrs. Dyre,” replied the Marshal; “but I must do as I am commanded.” The prisoners were condemned on the twentieth of October. The twenty-seventh was the day appointed for the execution of the sentence. With a self-command and equinimity of mind rare in such circumstances, Mary employed the interval in writing an “Appeal to the Rulers of Boston;” an appeal, not in her own behalf, not for pardon, nor life, but for a redress of the wrongs of her persecuted brethren. “I have no self-ends, the Lord knoweth,” she says, “for if life were freely granted by you, it would not avail me, so long as I should daily see or hear of the sufferings of my people, my dear brethren, and the seed with whom my life is bound up. Let my counsel and request be accepted with you to repeal all such laws, that the truth and servants of the Lord may have free passage among you, and you kept from shedding innocent blood, which I know there be many among you would not do, if they knew it so to be.”—“In love and in the spirit of meekness, for I have no enmity to the persons of any, I again beseech you.” There is not, throughout this magnanimous appeal the slightest intimation of a wish that her sentence should be remitted, no craven nor natural shrinking from death, no apologies for past offences, but the courage of an apostle contending for the truth, and the tenderness of a woman feeling for the sufferings of her people. Could it matter to so noble a creature, where, according to the quaint phrase of her sect, her “outward being dwelt,” or how soon it should be dissolved? On the evening of the twenty-sixth, William Dyre, Mary's eldest son, arrived in Boston, and was admitted to her prison. He came in the hope of persuading his mother to make such concessions in regard to her faith, as to conciliate her judges, and procure a reprieve. All night he remained with her. The particulars of this interview have not been preserved. Mary's enemies have not been scrupulous in the record of her virtues, and her friends appear to have considered the affections of her nature scarcely worth a memorial, amidst the triumphs of her faith. We know the temper of woman, the tenderness and depth of a mother's love. We may imagine the intense feelings of the son, on the eve of his mother's threatened execution, pleading for the boon of her life; we may imagine the conflict between the yearnings of the mother, and the resistance of the saint; and we may be sure that we cannot exaggerate its violence, nor its suffering. The saint was triumphant, and on the following morning, Mary was led forth, between her two friends to the place of execution. A strong guard escorted the prisoners, and, as if to infuse the last drop of bitterness in their cup, Mr. Wilson, “the minister of Boston,” attended them. There were coarse and malignant spirits among the spectators. “Are you not ashamed,” said one of them tauntingly to Mary, “are you not ashamed to walk thus hand in hand between two young men?” “No,” she replied, “this is to me an hour of the greatest joy I could have in the world. No eye can see, nor ear hear, nor tongue utter, nor heart understand the sweet incomes and refreshings of the spirit of the Lord, which I now feel.” Death could not appal a mind so lofty and serene. Man could not disturb a peace so profound. Her companions evinced a like composure. They all tenderly embraced at the foot of the scaffold. Robinson first mounted it, and called on the spectators to witness for him that he died, not as a malefactor, but for testifying to the light of Christ. Stevenson, the moment before the hangman performed the last act, said, “This day we shall be at rest with the Lord.” Mary was of a temper, like the intrepid Madame Roland, to have inspired a faltering spirit by her example; O 2 far more difficult she must have found it, to behold the last quiverings and strugglings of mortality, in the persons of her friends. But even after this, she was steadfast, and ascended the scaffold with an unblenching step. Her dress was scrupulously adjusted about her feet, her face covered with a handkerchief, and the halter put around her neck. The deep silence of this awful moment was broken by a piercing cry. “Stop! she is reprieved!” was sent from mouth to mouth, till one glad shout announced the feeling of the gazing multitude. Was there one of all those gathered to this fearful spectacle, whose heart did not leap with joy?—Yes—the sufferer and victim, she, to whom the gates of death had been opened. “Her mind,” says her historian, “was already in heaven, and when they loosed her feet and bade her come down, she stood still, and said she was willing to suffer as her brethren had, unless the magistrates would annul their cruel law.” Her declaration was disregarded, she was forced from the scaffold, and reconducted to prison. There she was received in the arms of her son, and she learnt from him that she owed her life to his prolonged intercession. Fortitude, the merit of superior endurance, has often been conceded to woman. One of our most celebrated surgeons had the magnanimity to say to a patient on whom he had just performed an excruciating operation, “Sir you have borne it like a man, you have done better than that, you have borne it like a woman.” But the most devoted champions of the weaker and timid sex, must concede, that they are inferior to man in courage to brave circumstances, and encounter danger; yet among all the valiant hearts in manly frames, that have illustrated our race, we know not where we shall find a more indomitable spirit, than Mary Dyre's. The tribunal of her determined enemies; the prison; the scaffold; the actual presence of death; the joy of recovered life; and, more potent than all, the meltings of maternal love, did not abate one jot of her purpose. On the morning after her reprieve, she dispatched from her prison a letter to her judges, beginning in the following bold, and, if the circumstances are considered, sublime strain;— “Once more to the General Court assembled in Boston, speaks Mary Dyre, even as before. My life is not accepted, neither availeth me, in comparison of the lives and liberty of the truth, and servants of the living God, for which, in the bowels of meekness and love I sought you.” She proceeds to charge them, most justly, with having neglected the measure of light that was in them, and thus concludes; “When I heard your last order read, it was a disturbance unto me, that was freely offering up my life to Him that gave it me, and sent me hither so to do; which obedience being his own work, he gloriously accompanied with his presence, and peace, and love in me, in which I rested from my labour.” The minds of the magistrates must have been wonderfully puffed up, and clouded with an imagined infallibility, and their hearts indurated by dogmatical controversy, or they would at once have perceived, that Mary Dyre was maintaining a righteous claim to the same privilege for which they had made their boasted efforts and sacrifices;—the privilege of private judgment. Whatever intimations they may have received from their conscience, they were not made public; no answer was returned to Mary's letters, and no concessions made to her sect; but it was thought prudent to commute Mary's sentence into banishment, with penalty of death in case of her return, and she was accordingly sent, with a guard, to Rhode Island. The sympathies of the good people of Boston had been awakened by the firmness of the prisoners in their extremity. The tide of feeling was setting in favour of their cause, murmurs of dissatisfaction with the proceedings of the magistrates were running through the little community, and it was thought best to allay the ferment, by a manifesto, which is throughout a lame defence, and which concludes in a manner worthy of the style of Cromwell and the school of the Jesuits. “The consideration of our gradual proceedings,” say they, “will vindicate us from the clamorous accusations of severity; our own just and necessary defence calling upon us, other means failing, to offer the point which these persons have violently and wilfully rushed upon, and thereby become felones de se, which, might it have been prevented, and the sovereign law, salus populi, been preserved, our former proceedings, as well as the sparing Mary Dyre upon an inconsiderable intercession, will evidently evince we desire their lives absent, rather than their deaths present.” Would the tragedy had ended here! But the last and saddest scene was yet to be enacted. We who believe that woman's duty as well as happiness lies in the obscure, safe, and not very limited sphere of domestic life, may regret that Mary did not forego the glory of the champion, and the martyr, for the meek honours of the wife and mother. Still we must venerate the courage and energy of her soul, when, as she said, “moved by the spirit of God so to do,” she again returned to finish, in her own words, “her sad and heavy experience, in the bloody town of Boston.” She arrived there on the twenty-first of May, 1660, and appears to have remained unmolested, till the thirty-first, when she was summoned before the General Court, which had cognizance of all civil and criminal offences. In this court, Governor Endicot was the presiding officer. He began her examination by asking her, if she were the same Mary Dyre that was there before. It appears that another Mary Dyre had made some disturbance in the Colony, and the Governor, probably pitying the rashness of our heroine, was willing to allow her an opportunity of evasion, but she replied unhesitatingly, “I am the same Mary Dyre that was here at the last General Court.” “Then you own yourself a Quaker, do you not?” “I own myself to be reproachfully called so.” “I must then repeat the sentence once before pronounced upon you.” After he had spoken the words of doom, “This is no more,” replied Mary calmly, “than thou saidst before.” “But now it is to be executed; therefore prepare yourself for nine o'clock to-morrow.” Still steadfast in what she believed her divinely authorised mission, she replied, “I came in obedience to the will of God, to the last General Court, praying you to repeal your unrighteous sentence of banishment, on pain of death, and that same is my work now, and earnest request, although I told you, that if you refused to repeal them, the Lord would send others of his servants to witness against them.” “Are you a prophetess?” asked Endicot. “I spoke the words which the Lord spoke to me; and now the thing is come to pass.” “Away with her!” cried the Governor; and Mary was reconducted to prison. We lament the imperfection of human intelligence, and the infirmity of human virtue, for “perfection easily bears with the imperfections of others;” but we rejoice, that, in the providence of God, the vice of one party elicits the virtue of another; that bigotry and persecution bring forth the faith and heroic self-sacrifice of the martyr. The fire is kindled and burns fiercely, but the Phœenix rises; the furnace, heated with seven-fold heat, does not consume, but purifies. Mary Dyre's family was plunged into deep distress, by her again putting her life in jeopardy. As her husband's religious faith did not accord with her own, he could not of course perfectly sympathize with her zeal in behalf of her persecuted sect, but the following letter, addressed to the Governor, which has not, we believe, before been published, bears ample testimony, that his conjugal affection had borne the hard test of religious disagreement. “Honoured Sir—It is with no little grief of mind and sadness of heart, that I am necessitated to be so bould as to supplicate your honoured self, with the honourable assembly of your General Court, to extend your mercy and favour once again, to me, and my children. Little did I dream, that I should have occasion to petition in a matter of this nature; but so it is, that through the divine providence and your benignity, my sonn obtayned so much pity and mercy at your hands, to enjoy the life of his mother. Now my supplication to your honours is, to begg affectionately the life of my dear wife. 'Tis true, I have not seen her above this half yeare, and cannot tell how, in the frame of her spirit, she was moved thus againe to run so great a hazard to herself, and perplexity to me and mine, and all her friends and wellwishers. “So it is, from Shelter Island, about by Peynod, Narragansett, &amp;c., to the town of Providence, she secretly and speedily journeyed, and as secretly from thence came to your jurisdiction. Unhappy journey, may I say, and woe to that generation, say I, that gives occasion thus of grief (to those that desire to be quiett), by helping one another to hazard their lives to, I know not what end, nor for what purpose. “If her zeal be so great, as thus to adventure, oh! let your pitty and favour surmount it, and save her life. Let not your love and wonted compassion be conquered by her inconsiderate maddness, and how greatly will your renoune be spread, if by so conquering, you become victorious. What shall I say more! I know you are all sensible of my condition—you see what my petition is, and what will give me and mine peace. “Oh! let Mercy's wings soar over Justice's ballance, and then whilst I live, I shall exalt your goodness; but otherways't will be a languishing sorrow — yea, so great, that I should gladly suffer the blow at once, much rather. I shall forbear to trouble you with words, neither am I in a capacity to expatiate myself at present. I only say this, yourselves have been, and are, or may be husbands to wives; so am I, yea to one most dearly beloved. Oh! do not deprive me of her, but I pray give her me once again. I shall be so much obliged forever that I shall endeavour continually to utter my thanks and render you love and honour most renouned. Pitty me! I beg it with tears, and rest your humble suppliant, W. Dyre.” It does not appear what answer, or that any answer was vouchsafed to this touching appeal. It is enough to know that it was unavailing, and that on the very next day after her condemnation, the first of June, Mary Dyre was led forth to execution. Some apprehensions seem to have been entertained that the mob might give inconvenient demonstrations of their pity for the prisoner, for she was strongly guarded, and during her whole progress from her prison to the place of execution, a mile's distance, drums were beaten before and behind her. The seaffold was erected on Boston Common. When she had mounted it, she was asked if she would have the Elders to pray for her? “I know never an Elder here,” she replied. “Will you have none of the people to pray for you?” persisted her attendant. “I would have all the people of God to pray for me,” she replied. “Mary Dyre! O repent! O repent!” cried out Mr. Wilson the minister; “be not so deluded and carried away by the deceits of the devil.” “Nay, man,” she answered, “I am not now to repent.” She was reproached with having said she had already been in paradise. To this she replied, “I have been in paradise many days.” She spoke truly. Her mind was the paradise of God. The executioner did his office. He could kill the body, demolish the temple, but the pure and glorious spirit of the martyr passed unharmed, untouched, into the visible presence of its Creator. The scene of this tragedy was the Boston Common; that spot, so affluent in beauty, so graced by the peace, and teeming with the loveliness of nature, was desecrated by a scaffold! stained with innocent blood! We would not dishonour this magnificent scene by connecting with it, in a single mind, one painful association. But let those send back one thought to the Quaker Martyr, who delight to watch the morning light and the evening shadows stealing over it; to walk under the bountiful shadow of its elms; to see the herds of cattle banqueting there; the birds daintily gleaning their food; the boys driving their hoops, flying their kites, and launching their mimic vessels on the mimic lake; whilst the little faineants, perhaps the busiest in thought among them, are idly stretched on the grass, seemingly satisfied with the bare consciousness of existence. The Boston Common, as it is, preserved and embellished, but not spoiled by art, still retaining its natural and graceful undulations, shaded by trees of a century's growth, with its ample extent of uncovered surface, affording in the heart of a populous city, that first of luxuries, space; trodden by herds of its natural and chartered proprietors; encompassed by magnificent edifices, the homes of the gifted, cultivated, and liberal; with its beautiful view of water (Heaven forgive those who abated it!) and of the surrounding, cultured, and enjoyed country; crowned by Dorchester Heights, and the Blue Hills;—Boston Common, has always appeared to us one of the choicest of nature's temples. The memory of the good is worthy such a temple; and we trust we shall be forgiven, for having attempted to fix there this slight monument to a noble sufferer in that great cause, that has stimulated the highest minds to the sublimest actions; that calls its devotees from the gifted, its martyrs from the moral heroes of mankind; the best cause, the fountain of all liberty — liberty of conscience!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">P CACOETHES SCRIBENDI. Glory and gain the industrious tribe provoke. —Pope. The little secluded and quiet village of H. lies at no great distance from our “literary emporium.” It was never remarked or remarkable for any thing, save one mournful pre-eminence, to those who sojourned within its borders—it was duller even than common villages. The young men of the better class all emigrated. The most daring spirits adventured on the sea. Some went to Boston; some to the south; and some to the west; and left a community of women who lived like nuns, with the advantage of more liberty and fresh air, but without the consolation and excitement of a religious vow. Literally, there was not a single young gentleman in the village—nothing in manly shape to which these desperate circumstances could give the form and quality and uses of a beau. Some dashing city blades, who once strayed from the turnpike to this sequestered spot, averred that the girls stared at them as if, like Miranda, they would have exclaimed— “What is't? a spirit? Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir, It carries a brave form:—But 'tis a spirit.” A peculiar fatality hung over this devoted place. If death seized on either head of a family, he was sure to take the husband; every woman in H. was a widow or maiden; and it is a sad fact, that when the holiest office of the church was celebrated, they were compelled to borrow deacons from an adjacent village. But, incredible as it may be, there was no great diminution of happiness in consequence of the absence of the nobler sex. Mothers were occupied with their children and housewifery, and the young ladies read their books with as much interest as if they had lovers to discuss them with, and worked their frills and capes as diligently, and wore them as complacently, as if they were to be seen by manly eyes. Never was there pleasanter gatherings or parties (for that was the word even in their nomenclature) than those of the young girls of H. There was no mincing—no affectation— no hope of passing for what they were not—no envy of the pretty and fortunate—no insolent triumph over the plain and demure and neglected,—but all was good will and good humour. They were a pretty circle of girls—a garland of bright fresh flowers. Never were there more sparkling glances,—never sweeter smiles—nor more of them. Their present was all health and cheerfulness; and their future, not the gloomy perspective of dreary singleness, for somewhere in the passage of life they were sure to be mated. Most of the young men who had abandoned their native soil, as soon as they found themselves getting along, loyally returned to lay their fortunes at the feet of the companions of their childhood. The girls made occasional visits to Boston, and occasional journeys to various parts of the country, for they were all enterprising and independent, and had the characteristic New England avidity for seizing a “privilege;” and in these various ways, to borrow a phrase of their good grandames, “a door was opened for them,” and in due time they fulfilled the destiny of women. We spoke strictly, and literally, when we said that in the village of H. there was not a single beau. But on the outskirts of the town, at a pleasant farm, embracing hill and valley, upland and meadow land; in a neat house, looking to the south, with true economy of sunshine and comfort, and overlooking the prettiest winding stream that ever sent up its sparkling beauty to the eye, and flanked on the north by a rich maple grove, beautiful in spring and summer, and glorious in autumn, and the kindest defence in winter;—on this farm and in this house dwelt a youth, to fame unknown, but known and loved by every inhabitant of H., old and young, grave and gay, lively and severe. Ralph Hepburn was one of nature's favourites. He had a figure that would have adorned courts and cities; and a face that adorned human nature, for it was full of good humour, kindheartedness, spirit, and intelligence; and driving the plough or wielding the scythe, his cheek flushed with manly and profitable exercise, he looked as if he had been moulded in a poet's fancy —as farmers look in Georgies and Pastorals. His gifts were by no means all external. He wrote verses in every album in the village, and very pretty album verses they were, and numerous too—for the number of albums was equivalent to the whole female population. he was admirable at pencil sketches; and once with a little paint, the refuse of a house painting, he achieved an admirable portrait of his grandmother and her cat. There was, to be sure, a striking likeness between the two figures, but he was limited to the same colours for both; and besides, it was not out of nature, for the old lady and her cat had purred together in the chimney corner, till their physiognomies bore an obvious resemblance to each other. Ralph had a talent for music too. His voice was the sweetest of all the Sunday choir, and one would have fancied, from the bright eyes that were turned on him from the long line and double lines of treble and counter singers, that Ralph Hepburn was a note book, or that the girls listened with their eyes as well as their ears. Ralph did not restrict himself to psalmody. He had an ear so exquisitely susceptible to the “touches of sweet harmony,” that he discovered, by the stroke of his axe, the musical capacities of certain species of wood, and he made himself a violin of chesnut, and drew strains from it, that if they could not create a soul under the ribs of death, could make the prettiest feet and the lightest hearts dance, an achievement far more to Ralph's taste than the aforesaid miracle. In short, it seemed as if nature, in her love of compensation, had showered on Ralph all the gifts that are usually diffused through a community of beaux. Yet Ralph was no prodigy; none of his talents were in excess, but all in moderate degree. No genius was ever so good humoured, so useful, so practical; and though, in his small and modest way, a Crichton, he was not, like most universal geniuses, good for nothing for any particular office in life. His farm was not a pattern farm—a prize farm for an agricultural society, but in wonderful order considering—his miscellaneous pursuits. He was the delight of his grandfather for his sagacity in hunting bees—the old man's favourite, in truth his only pursuit. He was so skilled in woodcraft that the report of his gun was as certain a signal of death as the tolling of a church bell. The fish always caught at his bait. He manufactured half his farming utensils, improved upon old inventions, and struck out some new ones; tamed partridges—the most untameable of all the feathered tribe; domesticated squirrels; rivalled Scheherazade herself in telling stories, strange and long—the latter quality being essential at a country fireside; and, in short, Ralph made a perpetual holiday of a life of labour. Every girl in the village street knew when Ralph's wagon or sleigh traversed it; indeed, there was scarcely a house to which the horses did not, as if by instinct, turn up while their master greeted its fair tenants. This state of affairs had continued for two winters and two summers since Ralph came to his majority and, by the death of his father, to the sole proprietorship of the “Hepburn farm,”—the name his patrimonial acres P 2 had obtained from the singular circumstance (in our moving country) of their having remained in the same family for four generations. Never was the matrimonial destiny of a young lord, or heir just come to his estate, more thoroughly canvassed than young Hepburn's by mothers, aunts, daughters, and nieces. But Ralph, perhaps from sheer good heartedness, seemed reluctant to give to “a party what was meant for mankind,” to give one the heart that diffused rays of sunshine through the whole village. With all decent people he eschewed the doctrines of a certain erratic female lecturer on the odious monopoly of marriage, yet Ralph, like a tender hearted judge, hesitated to place on a single brow the crown matrimonial which so many deserved, and which, though Ralph was far enough from a coxcomb, he could not but see so many coveted. Whether our hero perceived that his mind was becoming elated or distracted with this general favour, or that he observed a dawning of rivalry among the fair competitors, or whatever was the cause, the fact was, that he by degrees circumscribed his visits, and finally concentrated them in the family of his aunt Courland. Mrs. Courland was a widow, and Ralph was the kindest of nephews to her, and the kindest of cousins to her children. To their mother he seemed their guardian angel. That the five lawless, daring litle urchins did not drown themselves when they were swimming, nor shoot themselves when they were shooting, was, in her eyes, Ralph's merit; and then “he was so attentive to Alice, her only daughter—a brother could not be kinder.” But who would not be kind to Alice? she was a sweet girl of seventeen, not beautiful, not handsome perhaps,—but pretty enough—with soft hazel eyes, a profusion of light brown hair, always in the neatest trim, and a mouth that could not but be lovely and loveable, for all kind and tender affections were playing about it. Though Alice was the only daughter of a doting mother, the only sister of five loving boys, the only niece of three single, fond aunts, and, last and greatest, the only cousin of our only beau, Ralph Hepburn, no girl of seventeen was ever more disinterested, unassuming, unostentatious, and unspoiled. Ralph and Alice had always lived on terms of cousinly affection—an affection of a neutral tint that they never thought of being shaded into the deep dye of a more tender passion. Ralph rendered her all cousinly offices. If he had twenty damsels to escort, not an uncommon case, he never forgot Alice. When he returned from any little excursion, he always brought some graceful offering to Alice. He had lately paid a visit to Boston. It was at the season of the periodical inundation of annuals. He brought two of the prettiest to Alice, Ah! little did she think they were to prove Pandora's box to her, Poor simple girl! she sat down to read them, as if an annual were meant to be read, and she was honestly interested and charmed. Her mother observed her delight. “What have you there, Alice?” she asked. “Oh the prettiest story, mamma!—two such tried faithful lovers, and married at last! It ends beautifully: I hate love stories that don't end in marriage. “And so do I, Alice,” exclaimed Ralph, who entered at the moment, and for the first time Alice felt her cheeks tingle at his approach. He had brought a basket, containing a choice plant he had obtained for her, and she laid down the annual and went with him to the garden to see it set by his own hand. Mrs. Courland seized upon the annual with avidity. She had imbihed a literary taste in Boston, where the best and happiest years of her life were passed. She had some literary ambition too. She read the North American Review from beginning to end, and she fancied no conversation could be sensible or improving that was not about books. But she had been effectually prevented, by the necessities of a narrow income, and by the unceasing wants of five teasing boys, from indulging her literary inclinations; for Mrs. Courland, like all New England women, had been taught to consider domestic duties as the first temporal duties of her sex. She had recently seen some of the native productions with which the press is daily teeming, and which certainly have a tendency to dispel our early illusions about the craft of authorship. She had even felt some obscure intimations, within her secret soul, that she might herself become an author. The annual was destined to fix her fate. She opened it—the publisher had written the names of the authors of the anonymous pieces against their productions. Among them she found some of the familiar friends of her childhood and youth. If, by a sudden gift of second sight, she had seen them enthroned as kings and queens, she would not have been more astonished. She turned to their pieces, and read them, as perchance no one else ever did, from beginning to end—faithfully. Not a sentence—a sentence! not a word was skipped. She paused to consider commas, colons, and dashes. All the art and magic of authorship were made level to her comprehension, and when she closed the book, she felt a call to become an author, and before she-retired to bed she obeyed the call, as if it had been in truth, a divinity stirring within her. In the morning she presented an article to her public, consisting of her own family and a few select friends. All applauded, and every voice, save one, was unanimous for publication —that one was Alice. She was a modest, prudent girl; she feared failure, and feared notoriety still more. Her mother laughed at her childish scruples. The piece was sent off, and in due time graced the pages of an annual. Mrs. Courland's fate was now decided. She had, to use her own phrase, started in the career of letters, and she was no Atalanta to be seduced from her straight onward way. She was a social, sympathetic, good hearted creature too, and she could not bear to go forth in the golden field to reap alone. She was, besides, a prudent woman, as most of her countrywoman are, and the little pecuniary equivalent for this delightful exercise of talents was not overlooked. Mrs. Courland, as we have somewhere said, had three single sisters—worthy woman they were— but nobody ever dreamed of their taking to authorship. She, however, held them all in sisterly estimation. Their talents were magnified as the talents of persons who live in a circumscribed sphere are apt to be, particularly if seen through the dilating medium of affection. Miss Anne, the oldest, was fond of flowers, a successful cultivator, and a diligent student of the science of botany. All this taste and knowledge, Mrs. Courland thought, might be turned to excellent account; and she persuaded Miss Anne to write a little book entitled “Familiar Dialogues on Botany.” The second sister, Miss Ruth, had a turn for education (“bachelor's wives and maid's children are always well taught,”) and Miss Ruth undertook a popular treatise on that subject. Miss Sally, the youngest, was the saint of the family, and she doubted about the propriety of a literary occupation, till her scruples were overcome by the fortunate suggestion that her coup d'essai should be a Saturday night book entitled “Solemn Hours,”—and solemn hours they were to their unhappy readers. Mrs. Courland next beseiged her old mother. “You know, mamma,” she said, “you have such a precious fund of anecdotes of the revolution and the French war, and you talk just like the `Annals of the Parish,' and I am certain you can write a book fully as good.” “My child, you are distracted! I write a dreadful poor hand, and I never learned to spell—no girls did in my time.” “Spell! that is not of the least consequence—the printers correct the spelling.” But the honest old lady would not be tempted on the crusade, and her daughter consoled herself with the reflection that if she would not write, she was an admirable subject to be written about, and her diligent fingers worked off three distinct stories in which the old lady figured. Mrs. Courland's ambition, of course, embraced within its widening circle her favourite nephew Ralph. She had always thought him a genius, and genius in her estimation was the philosopher's stone. In his youth she had laboured to persuade his father to send him to Cambridge, but the old man uniformly replied that Ralph “was a smart lad on the farm, and steady, and by that he knew he was no genius.” As Ralph's character was developed, and talent after talent broke forth, his aunt renewed her lamentations over his ignoble destiny. That Ralph was useful, good, and happy— the most difficult and rare results achieved in life— was nothing, so long as he was but a farmer in H. Once she did half presuade him to turn painter, but his good sense and filial duty triumphed over her eloquence, and suppressed the hankerings after distinction that are innate in every human breast from the little ragged chimneysweep that hopes to be a boss, to the political aspirant whose bright goal is the presidential chair. Now Mrs. Courland fancied Ralph might climb the steep of fame without quitting his farm; occasional authorship was compatible with his vocation. But alas! she could not persuade Ralph to pluck the laurels that she saw ready grown to his hand. She was not offended, for she was the best natured woman in the world, but she heartily pitied him, and seldom mentioned his name without repeating that stanza of Gray's, inspired for the consolation of hopeless obscurity: “Full many a gem of purest ray serene,” &amp;c. Poor Alice's sorrows we have reserved to the last, for they were heaviest. “Alice,” her mother said, “was gifted; she was well educated, well informed; she was every thing necessary to be an author.” But Alice resisted; and, though the gentlest, most complying of all good daughters, she would have resisted to the death—she would as soon have stood in a pillory as appeared in print. Her mother, Mrs. Courland, was not an obstinate woman, and gave up in despair. But still our poor heroine was destined to be the victim of this cacoethes scribendi; for Mrs. Courland divided the world into two classes, or rather parts—authors and subjects for authors; the one active, the other passive. At first blush one would have thought the village of H. rather a barren field for such a reaper as Mrs. Courland, but her zeal and indefatigableness worked wonders. She converted the stern scholastic divine of H. into as much of a La Roche as she could describe; a tall wrinkled bony old woman, who reminded her of Meg Merrilies, sat for a witch; the school master for an Ichabod Crane; a poor half witted boy was made to utter as much pathos and sentiment and wit as she could put into his lips; and a crazy vagrant was a God-send to her. Then every “wide spreading elm,” “blasted pine,” or “gnarled oak,” flourished on her pages. The village church and school house stood there according to their actual dimensions. One old pilgrim house was as prolific as haunted tower or ruined abbey. It was surveyed outside, ransacked inside, and again made habitable for the reimbodied spirits of its founders. The most kind hearted of woman, Mrs. Courland's interests came to be so at varience with the prosperity of the little community of H. that a sudden calamity, a death, a funeral, were fortunate events to her. To do her justice she felt them in a two-fold capacity. She wept as a woman, and exulted as an author. The days of the calamities of authors have passed by. We have all wept over Otway and shivered at the thought of Tasso. But times are changed. The lean sheaf is devouring the full one. A new class of sufferers has arisen, and there is nothing more touching in all the memoirs Mr. D`Israeli has collected, than the trials of poor Alice, tragi-comic though they were. Mrs. Courland's new passion ran most naturally in the worn channel of maternal affection. Her boys were too purely boys for her art—but Alice, her sweet Alice, was pre-eminently lovely in the new light in which she now placed every object. Not an incident of her life but was inscribed on her mother's memory, and thence transferred to her pages, by way of precept, or example, or pathetic or ludicrous circumstance. She regretted now, for the first time, that Alice had no lover whom she might introduce among her dramatis personæ. Once her thoughts did glance on Ralph, but she had not quite merged the woman in the author; she knew instinctively that Alice would be particularly offended at being thus paired with Ralph. But Alice's public life was not limited to her mother's productions. She was the darling niece of her three aunts. She had studied botany with the eldest, and Miss Anne had recorded in her private diary all her favourite's clever remarks during their progress in the science. This diary was now a mine of gold to her, and faithfully worked up for a circulating medium. But, most trying of all to poor Alice, was the attitude in which she appeared in her aunt Sally's “solemn hours.” Every aspiration of piety to which her young lips had given utterance was there printed. She felt as if she were condemned to say her prayers in the market place. Every act of kindness, every deed of charity, she had ever performed, were produced to the public. Alice would have been consoled if she had known how small that public was; but, as it was, she felt like a modest country girl when she first enters an apartment hung on every side with mirrors, when, shrinking from observation, she sees in every direction her image multiplied and often distorted; for, notwithstanding Alice's dutiful respect for her good aunts, and her consciousness of their affectionate intentions, she could not but perceive that they were unskilled painters. She grew afraid to speak or to act, and from being the most artless, frank, and, at home, social little creature in the world, she became as silent and as stiff as a statue. And, in the circle of her young associates, her natural gaiety was constantly checked by their winks and smiles, and broader allusions to her multiplied portraits; for they had instantly recognized them through the thin veil of feigned names of persons and places. They called her a blue stocking too; for they had the vulgar notion that every body must be tinged that lived under the same roof with an author. Our poor victim was afraid to speak of a book —worse than that, she was afraid to touch one, and the last Waverley novel actually lay in the house a month before she opened it. She avoided wearing even a blue ribbon, as fearfully as a forsaken damsel shuns the colour of green. It was during the height of this literary fever in the Courland family, that Ralph Hepburn, as has been mentioned, concentrated all his visiting there. He was of a compassionate disposition, and he knew Alice was, unless relieved by him, in solitary possession of their once social parlour, while her mother and aunts were driving their quills in their several apartments. Oh! what a changed place was that parlour! Not the tower of Babel, after the builders had forsaken it, exhibited a sadder reverse; not a Lancaster school, when the boys have left it, a more striking contrast. Q Mrs. Courland and her sisters were all “talking women,” and too generous to encroach on one another's rights and happiness. They had acquired the power to hear and speak simultaneously. Their parlour was the general gathering place, a sort of village exchange, where all the innocent gossips, old and young, met together. “There are tongues in trees,” and surely there seemed to be tongues in the very walls of that vocal parlour. Every thing there had a social aspect. There was something agreeable and conversable in the litter of netting and knitting work, of sewing implements, and all the signs and shows of happy female occupation. Now, all was as orderly as a town drawing room in company hours. Not a sound was heard there save Ralph's and Alice's voices, mingling in soft and suppressed murmurs, as if afraid of breaking the chain of their aunt's ideas, or, perchance, of too rudely jarring a tenderer chain. One evening, after tea, Mrs. Courland remained with her daughter, instead of retiring, as usual, to her writing desk.—“Alice, my dear,” said the good mother, “I have noticed for a few days past that you look out of spirits. You will listen to nothing I say on that subject; but if you would try it, my dear, if you would only try it, you would find there is nothing so tranquillizing as the occupation of writing.” “I shall never try it, mamma.” “You are afraid of being called a blue stocking. Ah! Ralph, how are you?”—Ralph entered at this moment.—“Ralph, tell me honestly, do you not think it a weakness in Alice to be so afraid of blue stockings?” “It would be a pity, aunt, to put blue stockings on such pretty feet as Alice's.” Alice blushed and smiled, and her mother said— “Nonsense, Ralph; you should bear in mind the celebrated saying of the Edinburgh wit—`no matter how blue the stockings are, if the petticoats are long enough to hide them.' ” “Hide Alice's feet! Oh aunt, worse and worse!” “Better hide her feet, Ralph, than her talents—that is a sin for which both she and you will have to answer. Oh! you and Alice need not exchange such significant glances! You are doing yourselves and the public injustice, and you have no idea how easy writing is.” “Easy writing, but hard reading, aunt.” “That's false modesty, Ralph. If I had but your opportunities to collect materials”—Mrs. Courland did not know that in literature, as in some species of manufacture, the most exquisite productions are wrought from the smallest quantity of raw material—“There's your journey to New York, Ralph,” she continued, “you might have made three capital articles out of that. The revolutionary officer would have worked up for the `Legendary;' the mysterious lady for the `Token;' and the man in black for the `Remember Me;'—all founded on fact, all romantic and pathetic.” “But mamma,” said Alice, expressing in words what Ralph's arch smile expressed almost as plainly, “you know the officer drank too much; and the mysterious lady turned out to be a runaway milliner; and the man in black—oh! what a theme for a pathetic story!—the man in black was a widower, on his way to Newhaven, where he was to select his third wife from three recommended candidates.” “Pshaw! Alice: do you suppose it is necessary to tell things precisely as they are?” “Alice is wrong, aunt, and you are right; and if she will open her writing desk for me, I will sit down this moment, and write a story—a true story—true from beginning to end; and if it moves you, my dear aunt, if it meets your approbation, my destiny is decided.” Mrs. Courland was delighted; she had slain the giant, and she saw fame and fortune smiling on her favourite. She arranged the desk for him herself; she prepared a folio sheet of paper, folded the ominous margins; and was so absorbed in her bright visions, that she did not hear a little by-talk between Ralph and Alice, nor see the tell-tale flush on their cheeks, nor notice the perturbation with which Alice walked first to one window and then to another, and finally settled herself to that best of all sedatives—hemming a ruffle. Ralph chewed off the end of his quill, mended his pen twice, though his aunt assured him “printers did not mind the penmanship,” and had achieved a single line when Mrs. Courland's vigilant eye was averted by the entrance of her servant girl, who put a packet into her hands. She looked at the direction, cut the string, broke the seals, and took out a periodical fresh from the publisher. She opened at the first article—a strangely mingled current of maternal pride and literary triumph rushed through her heart and brightened her face. She whispered to the servant a summons to all her sisters to the parlour, and an intimation, sufficiently intelligible to them, of her joyful reason for interrupting them. Our readers will sympathize with her, and with Alice too, when we disclose to them the secret of her joy. The article in question was a clever composition written by our devoted Alice when she was at school. One of her fond aunts had preserved it, and aunts and mother had combined in the pious fraud of giving it to the public, unknown to Alice. They were perfectly aware of her determination never to be an author. But they fancied it was the mere timidity of an unfledged bird; and that when, by their innocent artifice, she found that her pinions could soar in a literary atmosphere, she would realize the sweet fluttering sensations they had experienced at their first flight. The good souls all hurried to the parlour, eager to witness the coup de theatre. Miss Sally's pen stood emblematically erect in her turban; Miss Ruth, in her haste, had overset her inkstand, and the drops were trickling down her white dressing, or, as she now called it, writing-gown; and Miss Anne had a wild flower in her hand, as she hoped, of an undescribed species, which, in her joyful agitation, she most unluckily picked to pieces. All bit their lips to retain their impatient congratulations. Ralph was so intent on his writing, and Alice on her hemming, that neither noticed the irruption; and Mrs. Courland was obliged twice to speak to her daughter before she could draw her attention. “Alice, look here—Alice, my dear.” “What is it, mamma? something new of yours?” “No; guess again, Alice.” “Of one of my aunts, of course?” “Neither, dear, neither. Come and look for yourself, and see if you can then tell whose it is.” Alice dutifully laid aside her work, approached and took the book. The moment her eye glanced on the fatal page, all her apathy vanished—deep crimson overspread her cheeks, brow, and neck. She burst into tears of irrepressible vexation, and threw the book into the blazing fire. The gentle Alice! Never had she been guilty of such an ebullition of temper. Her poor dismayed aunts retreated; her mother looked at her in mute astonishment; and Ralph, struck with her emotion, started from the desk, and would have asked an explanation, but Alice exclaimed—“Don't say any thing about it, mamma—I cannot bear it now.” Mrs. Courland knew instinctively that Ralph would sympathize entirely with Alice, and quite willing to avoid an explanation, she said—“Some other time, Ralph, I'll tell you the whole. Show me now what you have written. How have you begun?” Ralph handed her the paper with a novice's trembling hand. “Oh! how very little! and so scratched and interlined! but never mind—`c'est le premier pas qui coute.' ” While making these general observations, the good Q 2 mother was getting out and opening her spectacles, and Alice and Ralph had retreated behind her. Alice rested her head on his shoulder, and Ralph's lips were not far from her ear. Whether he was soothing her ruffled spirit, or what he was doing, is not recorded. Mrs. Courland read and re-read the sentence. She dropped a tear on it. She forgot her literary aspirations for Ralph and Alice—forgot she was herself an author—forgot every thing but the mother; and rising, embraced them both as her dear children, and expressed, in her raised and moistened eye, consent to their union, which Ralph had dutifully and prettily asked in that short and true story of his love for his sweet cousin Alice. In due time the village of H. was animated with the celebration of Alice's nuptials: and when her mother and aunts saw her the happy mistress of the Hepburn farm, and the happiest of wives, they relinquished, without a sigh, the hope of ever seeing her an Author.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ELDEST SISTER. “Lucy loved all that grew upon the ground, And loveliness in all things living found; The gilded fly—the fern upon the wall Were nature's works, and admirable all.” “Yet not so easy was my conquest found, I met with trouble ere with triumph crown'd.” Crabbe. Mr. Walsingham was seated at his writing-desk, absorbed in a literary labour, when Theresa, his eldest daughter, opened his door, advanced eagerly, paused, for a moment, arrested by his deeply thoughtful aspect, and again advanced, as, without raising his eye from his paper, he stretched his hand towards her and smiled with that sweet parental smile that indicated the father was never quite merged in the student. “I would not have interrupted you, papa,” said Theresa, “but I have something so very important to say to you.” Mr. Walsingham, now the sole parent of a numerous family of children, was as much accustomed as a mother to the communication of the manifold wants, that to the magnifying vision of a child are very important, and affection, and necessity, unerring teachers, had taught him the mother's instinct, to enter completely into his children's feelings—to stoop to their point of sight. “Come in, Theresa,” he replied to his daughter's request, “you interrupt me no more than the passing stream is interrupted by the shadow of the pretty flower that waves on its brink. What have you so important to say?—a letter!—from whom?” “From dear Mrs. Clifford, papa, and such a pressing invitation for me to pass a few days at Bellevue.” Mr. Walsingham took the letter, but before he had half read it, or at all replied to the eager petition of Theresa's eyes, half a dozen of the younger children made a sortie from the nursery; as sturdy a little band of remonstrants as ever appeared before any tribunal. “Don't let Theresa go! papa,—you must not let her go!” they cried with a unanimous voice. “Softly, softly, my children—you shall all be heard in turn. Why not let her go, James?” “Because, papa, it is impossible for me to get my French lessons ready for Mr. Rabbineau if Theresa does not assist me.” “Why should not Theresa go, Julia?” “Because, papa, my music master is as cross as thunder, when Theresa does not help me with my practising.” “Why should not Theresa go, Ellen?” “Because, papa, she has not made but just one complete suit for my new doll.” “Why should not Theresa go, Ned?” “Because, papa, she has got to new cover my ball.” “And you, little Willie, have you any reason why you cannot let sister Theresa go away for a little while?” “Yes, indeed, papa,” replied a bright eyed little cherub, climbing into his sister's lap. “I can't let her go, because she does everything for me.” “They are unskilful petitioners, Theresa,” said the father, his delight at the tribute each had involuntarily paid the sweet elder sister gleaming in his moistened eye. “Theresa does so much for us all, my dear children,” he continued, “that I believe we must give her the pleasure of a visit to Bellevue.” Theresa thanked her father warmly, and soon reconciled the minds of the young tribe to her departure, by shifting disappointment with expectation—easy juggling with juvenile subjects. Theresa Walsingham is the eldest of eight children. At fourteen she lost her mother. Her father, consulting only her good, and generously sacrificing his own strongest inclinations, sent her away from him for two years, to an institution where her education was successfully conducted. At sixteen she returned home to take the head of his family, and the place of mother, and elder sister, to the infant band. Theresa had no imposing personal qualifications for her official station. We have seen overgrown girls of sixteen, with grave aspect, and magisterial air, and solemn voice, and dignified movement, that looked as if, like Eve, they had been born grown up—with nothing of the dew and freshness—and, it may be, imperfection of the morning of life about them. Not so with Theresa. She is not a hair's breadth above the medium of feminine height; she has a child-like air and movement; a tender, flexible voice; a simplicity, impulsiveness, and gaiety of manner, that betrays inexperience at every turn. There is nothing about her that demands respect, but every thing that inspires love. She is not a beauty, and yet who can look in that bright sweet face; at that clear laughing eye; that exquisitely compounded, ever varying red and white, that round dimpled cheek; that sweet tempered graceful mouth; that fair, waving, luxuriant hair— who can look at this combination, lighted up with intelligence, and tenderly shaded by feeling, without forgetting the rule and art of criticism, and feeling that she is beautiful. Theresa came home to the care of a large family, without any very definite notion of what awaited her. She loved her father devotedly. The memory of her mother was so reverential and vivid, that it operated like her continual presence. But next to the everliving fountain of love in her affectionate heart, Theresa's best qualification for her arduous duties was a most happily constituted temper, a perpetual sunshine that brightened every thing around her. This may not be merit, but it is a singular physical felicity to have the instrument so perfect that no jar, no shock, no unskilful touch can put it out of tune, or bring forth a discordant note. Theresa has ardent affections, and strong preferences in matters that all deem essential, but not a particle of sensibility to those trifles at which most persons are disquieted—and disquieted in vain. She cares not whether the day be cloudy or bright; she is unconscious even of the appalling difference between a southwest and northeast wind. Whether she rides or walks, within walking distance, is a matter of no moment to her. She can sit with the windows up or down, as suits the temperament of her companions. She can eat of any dish, cooked in any mode, with a keen relish. She is never discontented alone; never dissatisfied in company; never annoyed by a creaking hinge, or slamming door, or any other trial of delicate nerves. I have seen her sitting in the nursery, reading undisturbed, while her two little sisters, one on each side, were busy with her beautiful tresses, pulling and snarling them into masses which they called curls. The only notice she took of them was to imprint a half-conscious kiss on each warm ruddy cheek as it touched hers. It was a picture of childhood, love, grace, and beauty that a painter should have caught and preserved. No wonder that her father should have delighted to see her sparkling cup of happiness full to the brim; that he took as much pleasure in attending her to Bellevue as she did in going there; that the tear which stole down her cheek at parting, opened a gushing fountain in his heart—a fountain of remembrance and hope. Theresa was to pass the month of June with Mrs. Clifford—the jubilee month of the year. Showers and sunshine were bringing forth the prettiest and freshest decorations of the face of nature; the birds were in full choir; the physical and animal world all alive to activity and joy. Mrs. Clifford lives on a highly cultivated farm, amidst the loveliest inland scenes of our country, fertilised and embellished by a river, that seems set, like a convex mirror, to catch and reflect every visible object. The mistress of this fair domain is a widow, just past the meridian of life, with a large fortune, and an only son. Her affections and interests do not, as is common in similar cases, all flow in the maternal channel, but are diffused like the bounties of heaven. She is the sun of her little system, and her benevolence is sent forth, like rays of light, in every direction, and to every object within her sphere. She is as genuine an amateur of happy human faces as the good Vicar of blessed memory, and she contrives always either to find or make them. She has the rare felicity of delighting her friends, and surrounding herself with grateful and satisfied dependants. She devotes herself to the business of making other people happy, with as much ardor as a lawyer pursues his profession. She is no professed reformer, and yet every body becomes more reasonable and amiable in her atmosphere. She has no single form of virtue, no Procrustes standard; and yet, by a kind of softening and harmonising influence, she assimilates every thing and every body to herself. Mrs. Clifford is never offended, or in the least annoyed by the peculiarities of any individual; on the contrary, she likes to cherish peculiarities, and bring them out, only taking care to place them in a favourable light. In this benevolent art of showing her friends in becoming lights, she excels any person I have ever known. But philanthropic as her temper is, she has her favourites, and first and chiefest among these is Theresa Walsingham. She loves Theresa, she says, for her mother's sake, who was her friend; and for her father's, who is; and most of all, for her own sake. There was a natural resemblance and accord between Mrs. Clifford and her young friend. If Mrs. Clifford had been blessed with a daughter, one would have expected to find her just what Theresa is; and not having one, it was natural for her to think of the only mode of supplying the defects of nature's gifts. She had no definite plan, no formal design in inviting Theresa at this time to Bellevue; but as soon as she was quietly fixed there, she wrote to her son Newton, then an ostensible student at law in New York, to remind him that his absence had been already too long; that strawberries were ripe; that Bellevue had put on its holiday suit, its many coloured robe, and that he must come home. From this moment Theresa heard of nothing but Newton's expected arrival. If an excursion was planned, or an extraordinary pleasure designed, it was deferred 'till Mr. Clifford should come. Every thing was done, or left undone in reference to him. “It is dull enough at Bellevue just now, Theresa,” Mrs. Clifford said, and repeated, “but when Newton comes he will make it all up to us.” “Yes,” chimed in half a dozen cordial and sincere voices, “Newton is the soul of Bellevue, that he is.” Fortunate and gifted must be that person who can sustain the excitation of spirits occasioned by the anticipation of an important arrival in the country! Theresa was one morning rambling alone along the river's side. She pursued a shaded footpath, 'till she came out upon a fisherman's hut, on the very verge of the water. A rheumatic, sickly-looking girl was sitting at the door, making artificial flies for angling. They were executed with taste and sufficient skill, and Theresa, after a kind greeting, seated herself, and R watched the progress of the girl's work, and expressed her admiration of her success in no measured terms. Sympathy is the electric touch. Lilly, for that was the girl's name, Lilly was delighted; never had her fingers worked more dexterously, and never did tongue speak more promptly than her's replied to Theresa's questions of how she learned her art, where she procured her materials, &amp;c. Mr. Newton Clifford had been at all the trouble of getting an old German to come all the way from New York to teach her. Mr. Newton had sent her full twenty dollars worth of materials. Mr. Newton, God bless him—and the benediction was not uttered as a phrase of custom, but with an intonation of deep feeling—Mr. Newton had done every thing for her father, and herself, and little Ben. “Had not Miss ever heard about Mr. Newton Clifford and little Ben?” Theresa confessed she had not; and Lilly dropped her work, and told with such minuteness and emotion, as called forth exclamations and even tears from her pretty auditor—how little Ben, her only brother, a smart daring little fellow, had paddled his father's boat into the middle of the river; and how, in trying to regain the shore, he had fallen into the stream near the milldam; how Mr. Newton, in spite of every body begging him, and screaming to him not to venture in so near the mill-dam—every body but herself —and she looked on and could not speak a word; how he had plunged in and grasped little Ben, but so near the dam, that they both went over together, Mr. Newton's arm fast clasped round Ben; and how he brought him to the shore, though both were like the dead when they got there! Sensibility and gratitude are always eloquent, and what girl of seventeen would not be moved by a generous deed, achieved by a living hero of twenty? Day after day Theresa stole down to the fisherman's cottage. She assisted Lilly at her pretty work; she even improved on the poor girl's skill, and under reiterated promises of secrecy, helped her make a beautiful collection of flies, which were designed for a welcoming gift for Mr. Newton Clifford. Theresa's lively imagination seized all the traits that were presented of Clifford by his partial friends, and combined from them a beautiful portrait, coloured with the rich and delicate hues of her own genuine feeling, and pure and elevated taste. Was the portrait a likeness? Was this young dream to be verified by the reality? Was the spirit of her imagination, resembling nothing she had seen in life, to be embodied in the heroic person—Newton Clifford? Every successive day Clifford was expected, and each day's mail brought some trivial excuse for his delay. A fortnight of the time allotted for Theresa's visit had already expired. Mrs. Clifford's habitual serenity was slightly overclouded, and there were moments when Theresa, to a keen observer, would have betrayed the condition of one who waits, a most unenviable state. She took one day her customary stroll to the fisherman's hut. She had completely won Lilly's heart; indeed, Theresa played the game of life so well, that she won all hearts. Her humble friend testified her affection, as women of every age and condition are apt to do, by setting the crown matrimonial on the brow of her favourite— and in this case it was, in her estimation, the crown of glory. “If matches are made in heaven,” she said, as her busy fingers were plying at her work, “I know what is to happen.” “What do you mean, Lilly?” asked Theresa, blushing at the slight disingenuousness of asking what she well knew. “Oh, Miss, you and Mr. Newton are so much alike —you even look alike. To be sure, he is very tall, and you are short, but that difference there should be; and he is very dark, and you are pure red and white, and that difference there should be; and his hair is jet black, and yours a sunny brown; and his eyes are hazle, and yours are blue as the sky, and that difference is prettiest of all.” Theresa laughed heartily, and asked, “Pray, where is the resemblance, Lilly?” “Oh, Miss, it's that look.” Lilly was right and true to nature in her perception of harmony in discords. It was after this last walk and conversation that Theresa returned to Bellevue, and entered the house heated, flushed, and tired. She strolled into the parlour, and went up to the glass to adjust her hair, which had fallen in disorder over her neck and face, and reflected in the mirror she saw the figure of a young man stretched on the sofa, with a book in his hand, that had the aspect of a fresh novel. Theresa's colour, deep as it was, deepened to an impurpled crimson. She felt as if she were under a gorgon spell. She could not turn, and nothing, she felt, could be more awkward and silly than to remain as she was. She ventured a second glance at the image, and a third and scurutinising one, for she now perceived that the young gentleman was, or affected to be asleep. “This must be Newton Clifford,” thought Theresa, “the figure, hair, complexion, features, all correspond exactly with the description, but, oh how unlike what I expected!” and if she had been addicted to tears, she would have shed them at her disappointment; but Theresa's temper was entirely of the l'allegro cast, and she laughed, laughed aloud and heartily. Clifford, for it was he, Clifford awoke, and his mother entering at the moment, after casting a look of surprise at Miss Walsingham, and of reproof at the recumbent and nonchalant attitude of her son, formally introduced them to each other. Theresa whirled round on her toe, laughed again, and then flew away like a bird startled from its perch. “For heaven's sake! my dear mother,” asked Clifford, “who is this hoydenish Blowzabella?” “Who? have I not just introduced her to you, Newton? Theresa Walsingham.” “Heaven forefend! I thought you said so, but I could not credit my ears. I expected to see Miss Walsingham a fashionable, thorough-bred girl; this little rude concern looks as if she had just come in from a bout at haymaking—heighho! what time is it?” He looked at an exquisite little watch, that, suspended by a safety chain, was tucked into his waistcoat pocket; “Eleven o'clock; this country air is a delicious opiate, mother,” and then yawning and falling back from his half recumbent posture on the sofa cushions, he relapsed into his broken slumbers, leaving Mrs. Clifford looking and feeling much like a child, who has blown a soap bubble, seen it expand and brighten, and then suddenly vanish into thin air. Mrs. Clifford was not consoled by being able in part to guess the cause of Theresa's merriment, for, even to a mother's eye, there was an appalling disparity between the present appearance of her son and the beau-ideal that had been pourtrayed to Theresa. Eight months before, Newton Clifford had gone to New York, simple but not rustic in his taste, dress and manners. His fortune and connections in life had cast him into the most fashionable society, and accident rather than choice had involved him in an intimacy with an ultra-fashionable young man of his own age, and a married lady of haut-ton. Both these persons, unfortunately for Clifford, happened to be gifted by nature with uncommon talent, which was all employed in giving to the follies and insipidities of fashion a certain interest, grace and brilliancy. The great philosophical truth that knowledge is power, is never more strikingly illustrated than by the influence that a woman of a certain age (that per se most uninteresting R 2 period of life) exercises over a young man of ardent feeling and lively imagination. The narrow limits of our story will not permit us to enter into any of the details of Clifford's fashionable training. Suffice it that he returned to Bellevue an ultraist of the beau-monde, disdaining whatever was simple and natural as much as a thorough-bred amateur of the Italian opera disdains sweet “wood notes wild.” He was dressed in the extreme of the dominant fashion. We cannot describe the particulars, for we have no place in our memory for the coxcombries of five years since, but his whole array was equivalent to a Broadway exquisite of the present season. Oliver's curled and frizzed imitation of Hyperion's curls; the “boundless contiguity” of hairs, called whiskers; the checked dishabille linen; the “Jubilee stock;” the diamond studs; the webfooted (we presume to propose the descriptive epithet) the webfooted pantaloon; the person garnished with certain feminine favours, pretty trophies, such as fantastical emblematic finger rings, a porphyry smelling bottle, appended to the ribbon of a quizzing glass; and filled with mousseline ambre or some other exquisite perfume; an almost (would it were quite so!) an almost invisible snuff box, with Irish blackguard; and in short all other marks of the most refined dandyism, imperceptible to an unpractised eye, and indescribable by an untechnical pen. And this was the person that, brought into sudden contrast with the heroic image in Theresa's mind, placed her sweet fancies in so ludicrous a light, and put them to so disorderly a flight. Theresa had, in common with all rational beings, men and women, an instinctive aversion to the unmanly species called dandies—these poor and only worshippers of the image of humanity which they themselves have set up; a dull variety of the monkey race, bearing a resemblance to man, mortifying to the veritable lords of the creation, and no way honourable to themselves. Dandyism was a sympathetic, not a constitutional disease with Clifford; this Theresa did not know, for she had only seen him when “the fit was on him,” but his mother did. At another time she would have quietly waited for the paroxysm to pass off, but now she had wise and long cherished hopes at stake, and she felt too much either to be, or to appear philosophical. Clifford's sagacity had penetrated the secret of his mother's wishes, without her having expressly communicated them, and knowing that he was a favourite of fortune, and being conscious of qualities that were at present quite hidden under his masquerade dress, and obscured by his temporary indifference to the simple pleasures of home and life, it was not an evidence of very extravagant self love that he should suspect Theresa of partaking his mother's views, and should consequently be as shy of her as the bird is of the decoy he has discovered to be set for him. Fortunately there was no pondering of the matter in our happy heroine's gay and innocent heart; she was not disturbed by even a suspicion of Clifford's mental conclusions. Her elastic spirit soon rose from the first pressure of disappointment, and she returned with her usual animation to her accustomed pleasures. She thought Mr. Clifford a very conceited, disagreeable person; that Bellevue had been far pleasanter without him; that he was the last man in the world that if she ever did marry (a supposition a young lady is apt to make mentally,) the last man in the world she would marry! Theresa had yet to learn that there is nothing in this uncertain life more uncertain than the final resolution of a young lady of seventeen! Clifford soon perceived that there was nothing affected nor equivocal in her indifference to him, and he was piqued by it. His natural tastes revived in the salutary atmosphere of home. He observed Theresa more attentively, and to observe was to feel the attraction of her loveliness. He caught himself, when he heard her laugh breaking forth in a distant part of the house, (never was a laugh more heartfelt and musical,) starting forward to listen, and involuntarily responding a faint echo; and once, when she was patting the neck of a spirited little black pony, on which she had been taking a solitary morning ride, he was betrayed into kissing, with real emotion, the whitest, most deeply dimpled and prettiest hand in the world. These and some other trifling circumstances began to intimate that a change was coming “o'er the spirit of his dream;” still he was not so deeply interested as to demonstrate Rosalind's infallible signs; the “hose ungartered,” the “bonnet unbanded,” the “shoe untied,” the “careless desolation;” but he was still “point device in all his accoutrements.” A pastoral hero may love without hope; but not so a fashionable young man of twenty-one. Newton Clifford's love, for he did actually, and that in a few days, feel an irresistible attraction towards Theresa; his love was of the most confident nature. It was true that from day to day Theresa perceived more and more of his agreeable qualities coming out, and once or twice it crossed her mind that she should, if she had not expected so much—at times—she should think Newton Clifford quite interesting. In the meantime the period of her visit was drawing to a close. Mrs. Clifford, who was eagerly watching the signs of the times, wrote to Theresa's father to beg an extension of her visit; one week more was granted, but then the order of return was peremptory. On the day before her departure, Theresa went to take leave of her friend Lilly. She had been to the cottage but once before since Clifford's arrival. On that occasion she went to cull from the collection of flies designed for him, those she had made. The little fly manufacturer remonstrated, but in vain. Theresa possessed herself of them, and strewed them to the winds. As she now approached the hut, she heard voices. Clifford was speaking in a tone of animated kindness to his poor protegé. “This is just what I fancied Clifford was before I saw him,” thought Theresa, and that very thought made her pause at the threshold of the door, from an undefined feeling of awkwardness. While she stood there she heard Lilly say, “Here are some flies, Mr. Newton, which I made for a present for you, if any thing can be called a present that I give to you.” Clifford expressed his gratitude by admiring them extravagantly, and then selecting one, “This,” he exclaimed, “is the very prettiest I ever saw. I can almost believe, with the poor little fish, that it is a real fly. If you could make me a dozen such as this, Lilly, for a friend of mine?” Lilly stammered in her reply. “Oh!” thought Theresa, who rightly conjectured that it was one of her own manufacture accidentally left among Lilly's; “Oh, the silly girl will certainly betray me.” Poor Lilly was confounded between the obligation of her promise to Miss Walsingham, on no account to betray her agency in the manufacture, the feminine desire of permitting the secret to evolve, and the necessity of confessing that she could not make flies equal to the specimen in Mr. Clifford's hand. In this dilemma she did what any other simple girl would have done, smiled, blushed, and faltered, and said she would do her very best for Mr. Newton, but she could no way in the world make anything so pretty, her fingers were stiffened with the rheumatism, and besides, they were never handy enough for such a piece of work as that.” “Then you did not make this particular one, Lilly; who in the name of wonder did?” Before Lilly could reply, and with the intention of preventing her, Theresa entered, but poor Lilly, far as she was from all duplicity, was betrayed by her surprise and confusion, into keeping the promise to the ear, and breaking it to the sense. She cast a speaking glance at Theresa, hung down her head, laughed outright, and turned away. Theresa blushed too, and was quite too much embarrassed, and provoked that she was embarrassed, to make any explanation, while Clifford with the utmost complacency bowed in acknowledgement to her, and taking out a small tablet case, deliberately placed the fly between its leaves. “At any rate,” exclaimed Theresa, half amused and half vexed, and unintentionally verifying Newton's fortunate conjecture, “at any rate, Mr. Clifford, I did not mean that you should have it.” “Perhaps not. We anglers, Miss Theresa, can never foresee exactly which fish will bite when we bait our hook.” An older, a more scrupulous, or more fastidious lady than Theresa Walsingham, might have found something offensive in this “perhaps,” this allusion to “angling” and “baiting,” but it was not in character for her to weigh and sift words; she really did not perceive any particular meaning in Clifford's; the secret being out, she had no farther concern about the matter. She had never seen him so animated, natural, and pleasing, and after chiding Lilly for betraying her, and kindly slipping into her hand a farewell gift, she returned with Clifford to Bellevue, but not till Lilly had contrived to say aside to him—“Keep the fly for a luck-penny, as they call it, Mr. Newton.” Her eye followed them, till she lost sight of them under the shadows of the lindens that grew on the river's side, she weaving, the while, the web of destiny, as dexterously as a “weird sister.” It was not one of the fairest days of summer, but the spirits of seventeen and twenty-one are not tempered by the weathergage. A dyspeptic may look at the sky and the vane before he smiles, but our gay pair were in a humour to smile in spite of clouds or storms. Clifford was flattered and elated by the little incident of the morning. It had confirmed all his prepossessions. He had discovered that he was under the influence of Theresa's attractions. He had made up his mind, at the first propitious moment to tell his love; that moment had arrived, and with it came, not doubts of his success, but some natural shrinkings. He began by speaking of her return in a desperate tone of voice; she replied, but not in an according key. “Then you will have no regrets at leaving Bellevue?” he said half reproachfully. “Indeed I shall! There is no place in the world I love so well, but home; and there is nobody I love so well as Mrs. Clifford, but papa.” “Nobody!” echoed Clifford with a look and tone of voice that was meant to convey a word of meaning; “can no one rival them in your heart, Theresa?” “Oh the children! of course; I doat on the children; and Willie, my pet Willie, oh, I shall never love any thing half so much as I love Willie.” “Are you quite certain of that?” asked Clifford. “Yes, perfectly,” she replied in the same careless manner. “Is this coquetry, the first—last sin of a pretty woman, or is it truth and nature?” thought Clifford; but before he had solved the riddle, and as they emerged from the shaded walk into the open grounds, they were joined by his mother, who coming from a different direction, was, like them, bending her steps towards home. Her maternal eye read the deep interest that was legible on her son's countenance; and Theresa's cheek bright with exercise and spirits, spoke the confirmation of her hopes. “The dear child has reason to feel happy,” was the mother's thought, and vexed that she had interrupted a tête-à-tête that she believed could be verging but to one conclusion, she said something about “old people being in the way,” and was hurrying past them; but Theresa slipt her arm into Mrs. Clifford's and detained her; “I do not know how it may be with old people,” she said, “but I am sure any party is the pleasanter for having you in it.” Mrs. Clifford, half gratified at her favourite's affection, and half vexed at the inopportune moment she had taken to evince it, was obliged to yield to the gentle constraint of Theresa's arm, and walk beside her. But her mind, still on one thought intent, she gave Clifford a bunch of flowers she had been culling during her walk. “There,” said she, “Newton, when I was young, lovers of common ingenuity would have discoursed with those flowers for an hour, without articulating a word.” “I am ignorant of their language, mother, but if you will teach me, I will endeavour to profit by your instructions.” “Attend to me then, and do not be looking at Theresa; she knows nothing at all of the matter. There is a passion flower, the emblem of hope; there a little bachelor's button, `hope even in the depths of misery;' that hollow hearted fox glove is insincerity; that wild geranium, cruelty; the honeysuckle, fidelity; periwinkle, friendship, a poor article when you want love; the Lavender confession—`She, Lavender to him sent, owning her love,' Hope, cruelty, fidelity! &amp;c. It would be a poor brain that could not make a moving tale from these cabalistic words.” “But,” said Theresa in all simplicity, “there is no emblem for love, and that is the basis of all the rest.” “True, true, most true, my dear Theresa,” replied Mrs. Clifford, smiling, “but I passed over the rosebud, for I thought the simplest, most unlearned in the floral vocabulary, knew that meant a declaration of love; and so it should, for it unfolds into what is sweetest and most beautiful in nature.” “True love, ma'am, you mean?” asked Theresa; and it was a bona fide inquiry. Mrs. Clifford laughed, Newton thrust the rosebud, which he seemed for the last minute to have been most critically examining, into his bosom, and they all mounted the steps to the piazza, where half a dozen of the family were assembled awaiting them. The following morning was the morning of Theresa's departure. Mrs. Clifford, as she had before promised, and Mrs. Clifford's son, which had not before been indicated, were to attend her home. As they left the town of Bellevue, on their way to the pier, where they were to embark in the steamboat, Theresa turned to give one parting look to the beautiful flowers that in unlimited profusion embellished the place. “Oh!” she exclaimed, “I wish I had thought to gather a bouquet to take with me.” Clifford offered to repair her omission, and turned again up the avenue, and did not rejoin the ladies till they had nearly reached the shore. “Oh,” said Theresa, as she took the flowers from him, “have you been gone so long and got nothing but buds! What possessed him,” she continued, “to put in this little withered wild rosebud among these fresh ones?” and she threw it away, and cooly tucked the stems of the rest under her belt riband; the withered bud was that which Clifford had the day before put into his bosom, and he had now added it to the bouquet; to him it seemed instinct with the feelings of the heart which had been throbbing against it for the last twelve hours. Fortunately he had walked on, as if to look out for the boat, and did not hear her, but his mother did, and exclaimed in a tone of reproach “Theresa!” Theresa thought her displeasure related solely to the bouquet. “Dear Mrs. Clifford,” she said, kissing her in her own affectionate manner, “do not be angry with me; there is, I own it, there is nothing so precious as moss rosebuds.” Mrs. Clifford always obeyed the French rule,— S “Whenever there are two interpretations of a phrase, receive the most agreeable.” “My own dear, dear child!” she exclaimed, returning Theresa's embrace with a warmth and emotion she did not at all comprehend, and which was not rendered more intelligible by the delighted gaze, with which, as she turned, she perceived Clifford was surveying them. Some acquaintances appeared at this moment, and no farther explanation was then possible, as they were immediately transferred to the thronged deck of a steamboat. Theresa was in irrepressible spirits, and for this, Mrs. Clifford and her son had but one interpretation. The one had perhaps forgotten, and the other never yet learned, that all deep emotions are serious. The truth was, Theresa had forgotten the conventional language of the rosebuds; her mind was preoccupied with home images; no brain-woven romance, but with filial thoughts of her beloved father, and of the eager eyes and glad hearts of the little tribe awaiting her. Such a heart as Theresa's, so full of delicate, strong, and unchanging affections, was not to be lightly won, and this Clifford was yet to learn at the expense of well requited sacrifices. Secure for the present in the estimate of all he had to confer, and in the assurance of a self-complacency that no disappointment had ever yet disturbed, he retired to a solitary corner of the cabin to enjoy, in writing to her, a more exclusive and satisfactory communion with Theresa, than he could amid the throng that encompassed her on the deck. The letter was a joyous rhapsody; the interpreter of his soul, “and faithful to its fires;” full of blissful feelings and blissful hopes. He filled it, crossed it, enclosed, and sealed it with the well known device of a laurel leaf, and the motto, “Je ne change qu'en mourant;” a motto presumptuously applied to many a passion that has had even a briefer existence than a summer's leaf. Thus prepared, the letter awaited an auspicious moment for delivery. That moment arrived, when Clifford handed Theresa from the carriage that had conveyed her from the boat to her father's door. “This speaks for me,” he whispered, “I will be with you again in ten minutes.” But joyous shouts and bounding steps were already ringing in Theresa's ears, and she heard nothing else, and did not think again of Clifford, till in less than ten minutes he returned, expecting to find Theresa awaiting to reciprocate the expression of those sentiments of which he had just communicated the delightful certainty. She was there, seated on her father's knee, recounting the pleasures of her jaunt; her pet Willie stood beside her on the sofa, his curly head lying fondly on her shoulder, and one little mischievous hand picking unheeded, one by one, the rosebuds from her waist, and throwing them on the floor, where two or three of the little urchins were dividing the spoil. The letter—the letter on which was suspended the destiny of life, had been dropped and forgotten by Theresa, who had never given it one glance, and if one thought, had supposed it to be one of the numerous unimportant packages belonging to her. Her sister Ellen, a busy, prying little daughter of Eve, had picked it up, torn off the seal, and at the moment Clifford entered was uttering a sort of jargon which she called reading it. Never, at any moment of her life, had Theresa looked more lovely than now, when her sweet face was lighted with the glow of those innocent and tender affections that are kindled at Nature's altar, and inspired by the breath of the Almighty. But Clifford had looked for something far more precious in his eyes, and mortified and disappointed, he was scarcely conscious of Mr. Walsingham's polite reception; hardly comprehended his words as he said, “You are deafened by the noisy joy of my children; they are half wild at the return of their elder sister; and I,” he added, wiping his moistened eyes, “am hardly less a child than any one of them.” Clifford in vain struggled to reply and to recover his self-possession. Fortunately, all were too much occupied with their own sensations to observe his, and he seized his unread letter, thrust it into his pocket, and made his escape. I know not what, if any, explanation followed, but three years subsequent I met the same parties at Bellevue. Clifford then with a slight abatement for a very youthful imagination, might have realized the early visions of Theresa. The few dregs of folly in his composition, had in the first fermentation risen to the surface, and worked off. How much he might have been indebted to the purifying influence of “le grand sentiment,” (for who shall define or limit its power,) we know not, but with all our preference for our heroine, we must confess he was worthy of her true and tender heart. Of his dandyism there was no relic, save the identical safety chain he had formerly worn; but instead of the fantastic watch appended to it, I discovered, (though it was scrupulously worn beneath the vest,) the little fly so elaborately wrought by Theresa, and of which, no doubt, he was well informed of the consecrating history. As to Theresa, she was unchanged; the same spontaneous flow of rich feelings, the same beautiful simplicity of character and naturalness, made more graceful, but not in the least impaired or obscured by the polish of the world. One visible change indeed there was, and it was expressed in the quick mutations of Theresa's beautiful colour; in the tender drooping of her eye; in word and action. A stronger, deeper, more controlling sentiment had taken possession of her heart than filial love, or than the affectionate devotion of an Eldest Sister.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">S 2 ST. CATHARINE'S EVE. “All is best though oft we doubt, What th' unsearchable dispose Of highest wisdom brings about, And ever best found in the close.” Milton. “On trouve dans la chronique de Raoul, Abbé de Coggeshall, sous cette année (1201) une histoire touchante qui montre à quel point l'enseignement religieux pouvoit être perverti, et combien le Clergé étoit loin d'être le gardien des mœurs publiques.” Early in the 13th century Agnes de Meran, the mistress-wife of Philip Augustus, held her court at the Chateau des roses Sur-Seine, not many leagues from Paris. The arts and luxuries of the time were lavished on this residence of the favourite. On one side of the Chateau, and leading out of the garden attached to it, was a winding walk, embowered by grape vines which, not being native in the north of France, and the art by which the gardener now triumphs over soil and climate being then in its infancy, were cultivated with great pains and royal expense. The walk, after extending some hundred yards, opened on a sloping ground, bounded by the Seine, and tastefully planted with shrubs and vines formed into arbours and bowers of every imaginable shape. The whole plantation was called Larigne. Parallel to a part of it ran the highway, hidden by a wall, excepting where it traversed an arched stone bridge that spanned the Seine, and which was itself almost embowered by tall acacias, planted at either end of it. Late in the afternoon of a September day, when the warm air was perfumed with autumnal fruits, and the sun glancing athwart the teeming vines, shot its silver beams across the green sward, and seemed, by some alchemy of the flowers to become molten gold as it touched their leaves, tinted with deep autumnal dyes; two ladies, followed by a Moorish servant girl, issued from the walk. The eldest was tall and thin. The soft round lines of youth had given place to the angles of forty; but though she had lost the beauty, she had retained the grace (happily that charm is perennial) of youth, and added to it the fitting quality of matronly dignity. Born in Provence, she was an exception to the general hue of its natives, her complexion having an extreme fairness, and a texture as delicate as that of infancy. She had that organ, to which the Phrenologist is pleased to assign the religious sentiment, strikingly developed; but a surer indication of a tendency to spiritual abstraction, was expressed in her deep set, intellectual, and rather melancholy eye. Her mouth, when closed, expressed firmness and decision, but, when in play, the gentlest and tenderest of human affections; and the voice that proceeded from it was the organ of her soul, and expressed its divine essence —love. Such was the lady Clotilde — the martyr, who would have been the canonized saint, had she died in the bosom of the orthodox church. The other female was a girl of sixteen, Rosalie, the daughter of Clotilde, and resembling her in nothing but the purity and spirituality of her expression. Her complexion was of the tint which the vulgar call fair, and the learned Thebans in such matters, brunette; her eyes were the deepest blue, and her eye-lashes long and so black, that in particular lights they imparted their hue to her eyes. Her hair, we are told, was of the colour that harmonized with her skin — what that hue was we are left to imagine. Her features, neck, and whole person (the feet and hands are dilated on with a lover's prolixity) the chronicle describes as cast in beauty's mould, “so that he who once looked on this fair ladye Rosalie saw imperfection in all other creatures.” Rosalie led, by her hand, a little girl of four years, a cherub in beauty. “Why, dear mama,” said Rosalie, “are you so silent and thoughtful? — and tell me — pray — why were you so cold to our sweet lady queen to-day, when she bade us prepare the fete for the king? — I would not pry into secrets, but when she spake low to you, did she not say something of sad looks not suiting festive days?” “She did, Rosalie — and yet she well knows they are but too fitting. Let us seat ourselves here, my child, and while Zeba looks after Marie I will entrust you with what is better suited to your discretion than your years.” — She beckoned to Zeba to relieve them from the child, but little Marie, a petted favourite of Rosalie's sprang on the bench and clung around her neck, till she was won away by a promise of a game of “hide and go seek,” among the vines and shrubs. “Rosalie,” continued the mother, pointing to Marie, “that child is not the offspring of a union which man deems honourable, and calls marriage, and which it pleases heaven, my child, to authorize to humanity in some stages of its weakness and ignorance, but she is — I hesitate to speak it to your pure ears — the fruit of illicit love.” “Mother! what mean you? — She is surely the child of our good lord king and of his wife — our lady Agnes and our queen?” “Our lady Agnes de Meran, Rosalie, but not his wife — nor our rightful queen.” “You should not have told me this! — you should not have told me this!” reiterated Rosalie, covering her eyes from which the tears gushed, “I loved her so well! — and Marie! — oh you should not have told me!” “My dear Rosalie, I have withheld it as long as I dared. The world to you is as a paradise, and I shrunk from exposing to you the traces of sin and evil that are upon it. But evil—temptation must approach you, and how are you to resist it, if you know not its existence? Listen patiently, my dear child. There is much in the story of our lady to excuse her with those compromising consciences that weigh sin against temptation; and much to make her pitied by those who weigh the force of temptation against the weakness of humanity.” “I am sure I shall pity her,” interrupted Rosalie. “Beware, my child. Pity, the gentlest spirit of heaven, sometimes loses her balance in leaning too far on the side of humanity.” “But pity is heaven-born, dear mother.” Clotilde did not reply, for she had not the heart to repress the instincts of Rosalie's affections; and Rosalie added, “I am sure our lady Agnes has sinned unwittingly.” “Alas, my child! — But listen — I must make my tale a brief one. Our royal master, who in his festive hours appears to us so kind and gracious, is stained with crimes, miscalled virtues by his blind guides and false friends.” “Crimes, mother?” “Yes, Rosalie, crimes — persecution and murder misnamed, by his uncle of Rheims, zeal — cruelty, rapine, excess, and what I will not name to thy maiden ears. He was anointed king in the blood of his subjects — for les fetes de la Toussaint, when he was crowned, were scarcely past when, set on by the Archbishop, he commanded his soldiers to surround the synagogues of the Jews, on their Sabbath-day, to drag them to prison, and rob them of their gold and silver to replenish the coffers which his father Louis had emptied for offerings to the church. The Jews hoped it was a passing storm, but the king ordered them to sell all they possessed, and with their wives and little ones to leave his dominions. Their property was sacrificed, not sold, and our royal master received the benedictions of the priests! The next objects of his zeal were the violators of the third commandment — the poor were drowned — the rich paid a fine into the king's treasury, for as our chronicle of St. Denis hath it, the king holds `en horreur et abomination ces horribles sacremens que ces gloutons joueurs de des font souvent en ces cours, et ces tavernes.”' “But, dear mother, was he not right to punish such?” “To fine the rich, and drown the poor, Rosalie?” — Rosalie perceived that her shield was ineffectual, and her mother proceeded, but not till she had cautiously looked around her. “To fill up the measure of his obedience to sacerdotal pride and hatred, he published an edict renewing the persecution against the Paterins.” — “The Paterins, mother?” Clotilde smiled faintly at her daughter's interrogatory. “The name of these much abused people you have not yet heard, for it is a perilous one to speak in our court; but they are the followers of those pious men who, having obeyed the commands of their Lord, and searched the Scriptures, have changed their faith and reformed their morals. They differ somewhat among themselves, having entered into the glorious liberty of the gospel, and being no longer bound to uniformity by the bulls of the Pope or the word of the Priest. They have all been marked by the purity of their lives — a few by their austerity. Some among them eat no meat, and others deem even marriage criminal.” “Mother!” exclaimed Rosalie, in a tone that indicated a revelation had burst upon her. “I read your thoughts, Rosalie — yes — I am a Paterin. Here in the very bosom of the court I cherish the faith for which many that I loved were cast into prison, and afterwards `made (I still quote from our Court Chronicle) to pass through material flames to the eternal flames which awaited them!”' “And was it such as you, my mother,” asked Rosalie, pressing her cheek to Clotilde's, “that thus suffered?” “Such, and far better, Rosalie; and who,” she added, the ecstasy of faith irradiating her fine countenance, “who would shrink from the brief material fire through which there is a sure passage to immediate and eternal glory?” If there are moments of presentiment when the future dawns upon the mind with all the vividness of actual presence, this was one to Rosalie. She threw her arms around her mother's neck and said in a trembling voice, “God guard my mother!” “He has guarded me,” replied the lady Clotilde, gently unlocking Rosalie's arms, “and will while it is best that I continue like the prophet safe in a den of lions. `Take no thought for the morrow,' Rosalie. — But I have been led far away from my main purpose, which was to give you a brief history of the lady Agnes.” “Our lord the king had contracted a marriage with Isemburg of Denmark, daughter of Waldemar le Grand. On his progress to receive her, he visited the castle of one of the Duke of Meranie's adherents, where a tournament was holding. His rank was carefully concealed. He was announced in the lists as le Chevalier affiance, and his motto was la bonne `esperance.' — Our lady Agnes — then in her sixteenth year — just your present age — presided as queen of love and beauty. Philip was thrice victorious, and thrice crowned by the lady Agnes. At the third time there were vehement demands that his visor should be removed. He appealed to Berchtold, the father of our lady, and prayed permission to preserve his incognito to all but the lady Agnes, to whom, if she were attended by only one of her ladies, he would disclose his name and rank. Berchtold allowing that nought should be refused to the brave and all conquering knight, granted the private audience of his daughter, and she selected me from among her ladies to attend her. Philip, affianced to another, and confessing himself bound to keep the letter of his faith, violated its spirit. He declared himself passionately in love with our lady, and vowed eternal faith to her. — Our poor lady, smitten with love, received and returned his vows. The marriage with Isemburg was celebrated four days after.” “Was he married to Isemburg?” “Yes, if that may be called marriage, Rosalie, which is a mere external rite — where there is no union of heart — where vows are made to be broken.” “This surely is most sinful — but not so when hearts as well as hands are joined—think you, mother?” The lady Clotilde proceeded without a reply to her daughter's interrogatory. “It was told through Christendom that the king of France, on receiving the hand of the beautiful Isemburg, was seen to turn pale and tremble, and shrink from her; and when her rare beauty and her many graces were thought on, there was much marvelling, and many there were who attributed the strange demeanour of the king to sorcery! The lady Agnes and I alone knew the solution of the mystery. — Eighty days after the marriage he appealed for a divorce to bishops and archbishops assembled at at Compeigne—his own servile tools. The marriage was annulled on a mere pretext, and immediately followed by the outward forms of marriage with our fair lady.” “I comprehend not these matters; but, mother, were not the lawful forms observed?” “Rosalie! beware how in your tenderness for your mistress you confound right and wrong. Priests may not, at their pleasure, modify the law of God. The rules of holy writ are few and inflexible. — Isemburg denied the validity of the divorce, and retired to a convent. The Pope, from worldly policy, has maintained her part. An interdict was lain upon the kingdom. Marriages and interments in consecrated ground were forbidden. Weeping and mourning pervaded Philip's dominions—all for this guilty marriage. Then followed reconciliation with the Pope—then fresh animosities and perjuries—and through all Philip has adhered to our lady.” “Faithful in that, at least, mother.” “Yes, faithful where faith was not due. The lady Isemburg still lives and claims her rights—every true heart in Christendom is for her, and it is only here, in the court of our lady, that her wrongs are unknown, or never mentioned.” “And why, my dear mother,” asked Rosalie, recurring to her first feelings, “why, since you have so long kept this sad tale from me, why did you tell it now?” “I kept it because that, yet a child in years, it was not essential you should know it, and I could not bear to throw a shade over your innocent and all-trusting love for our lady. Now you are entering on the scene of action yourself. Temptation will assault you from which I cannot shield you. Even your mother, my child, cannot keep your account with your Judge.” “Alas, no.—But what temptations have I to fear, dear mother?” “You are endowed with rare beauty, Rosalie, and in this court there will be many smooth tongues to tell you this.” “They have already told me so,” said the ingenuous Rosalie, slightly blushing. T “Who?—who?” aked her mother. “The lord Thiebant, and the young knights Arnold and Beaumont, and the king himself; but indeed, mother, it moved me not half so much as when my lady Agnes commends the manner of my hair, or the fitting of my kerchief.” “Ah, Rosalie, these flattering words have been as yet lightly spoken—as it were to a child, but when they are uttered in words of fire, par amour!” “Oh, if you fear for me, mother,” said Rosalie, dropping on her knees, and crossing her arms in her mother's lap, “I will now vow myself to the Virgin.” “Will you, Rosalie?” “In sooth I will. Not to immure myself within the walls of a convent, shut out from that communion which the Creator holds with his creatures through his visible works; and that still better communion vouchsafed to us when we are fellow-workers with Him in missions of mercy and love to His creatures.” “You are somewhat of a Paterin too, my Rosalie,” said her mother, rejoicing that her indirect lessons were so definitely impressed on her daughter's mind. “But have you comprehended the perfect spirituality of the Christian's law? Do you know there is no virtue in external obedience, however self-denying and self-afflicting that obedience may be, if the affections, the desires, the purposes, are not in perfect subjection to the will of God? Do you know that if you now vow yourself to a vestal's life, it would be sin should you hereafter, even in thought, repent this vow and sorrow for it.” “But, dear mother, that cannot be. I can never love another so well as I love you, and our poor lady Agnes. Now, therefore, in this quiet Temple of God let me make the vow.” Clotilde's face was convulsed with thick coming conflicting thoughts and feelings. In common with many of her sect, she had retained that tenderest and most poetic feature of the Catholic religion, a tender homage for the Virgin. She believed the holy mother would vouchsafe supernatural aid to her vestal followers, and this aid she thought might be essential to one who, with unsuspecting youth, and surpassing beauty, was beset by the dangers of a court of which virtue was not the presiding genius. But on the other hand, she feared to take advantage of the inexperience of her child. Her very willingness to assume the shackles, made her mother shrink from their imposition. Rosalie clasped her hands and raised her eyes. “Stay, my sweet child—not now,” said her mother, “a vow like this demands previous meditation, and much communing with your own spirit. I trust you are moved by heavenly inspiration, and if so, the work now begun will be perfected. In eight days from this we celebrate the marriage of St. Catharine, that marriage which typifies the sacred spiritual union of the perfected saint with the author of her salvation. I have twice dreamed the day had arrived, and marvellous, and spirit-stirring fancies, if they be fancies, have mingled with my dreams. I witnessed the holy marriage. I gazed at the sacred pair, when suddenly, as St. Catharine was receiving the bridal ring, it was you, my Rosalie, and not the saint; your face was as vivid as it is now to my actual sense, and instead of the pale slender hand of the saint, was your's—dimpled and rose tinted as it now is; but alas! the ring would not go upon your finger. While I marvelled and sorrowed, flames crackled around me; you, the celestial bridegroom, all vanished from my eyes, clouds of smoke rose around me, as I looked up for help, their dense volume collected over my head parted and I beheld a crown as bright as if it were of woven sunbeams, a martyr's crown.” “Dear mother! I like not this dream.” “Be not disquieted, my child. Our dreams are sometimes heavenly inspirations, but oftener compounded of previous thoughts and impressions. Martyrdom has ere now been within the scope of my expectations, and that your marriage may be like that of the blessed St. Catharine, is my continual prayer. Look not back, but forward. If it please heaven to strengthen and confirm the good purpose now conceived, on St. Catharine's Eve you shall make your vow.” “So be it, mother, yet I would it were now.” The ladies were interrupted by a page from the queen who came to summon the lady Clotilde to his mistress' presence. Little Marie seeing her favourite at liberty left her attendant and insisted, with the vehemence of a petted princess as she was, that Rosalie should take a stroll with her along the bank of the river. Rosalie, scarcely past childhood herself, felt her spirits vibrate to the touch of her little friend, and they ran on sportively together, followed by the Moorish servant, till they came to the shore, where beneath a clump of trees, overgrown with flowering vines, a bench had been placed to afford a poste restante, which a painter might have selected, as affording, on one side a view of the turrets of the castle, towering above the paradise in which it was embosomed, and on the other, of the windings of the Seine and the picturesque bridge that crossed it. Just before Rosalie arrived at this point of sight, a cavalcade had passed the bridge on their way to the castle—the Archbishop of Rheims and his retinue. One of them had lagged behind the rest, and stopping on the bridge to survey the river, he had caught a glimpse of what seemed to him the most poetic personifications of youth and childhood that his eye had ever rested on. The spectator was mounted on a Spanish jennet, caparisoned with the rich decorations which the knights of the time, who regarded their steeds almost as brothers in arms, were wont to lavish on them. The bridle was garnished with silver bells, so musical that they seemed to keep time to the graceful motions of the animal. It might have puzzled an observer to decide to which of the two great faineant classes that then divided the Christian world, knights, or monks, to assign the rider. Beneath a long monastic mantlo, fastened by a jewelled clasp, a linked mailed shirt might be perceived. The face of the wearer had the open gay expression of a preux chevalier, with a certain softness and tenderness that indicated a disposition rather to a reflective, that an active life. He had become wearied of the solemn and silent pomp of the archbishop's retinue, and had resigned the distinction of riding beside his highness for a gayer companion and a freer position in the rear of the train. “By my faith, Arnaud,” said he, “I find these lords, bishops and archbishops very stupid, in propria persona.” “Ah, Gervais, had you heeded me! but as the proverb says `good counsel has no price.”' “But my good master priest, we have yet to see whether my hope will not give the lie to your experience.” “Bravo!” retorted Arnaud, laughing louder than one would have dared to laugh nearer the archbishop. “St. Catharine's is the day you doff that mailed shirt of yours, forever? When that day comes round again, we shall see whether dame Experience has forfeited a name for speaking truth, and lying Hope has gained one.” “Holy Mary!” exclaimed Gervais de Tilbery, checking his horse as he entered upon the stone bridge. “What houri is that!” “Softly, Sir Gervais,” replied his friend, “it is scarcely prudent to utter oaths, and gaze after houris within a bow-shot of my lord archbishop,—within seven days of St. Catharine's Eve! Are you spell-bound, Gervais?” Gervais heeded not the prudent caution of his friend, T 2 but asking him to bid Hubert (his attendant) come to him, he permitted Arnaud to proceed alone. Hubert came. Gervais gave him the horse to lead to the castle. Hubert disappeared, and Gervais succeeded in scaling the bridge and letting himself down within the paradise that enclosed the houri, whom he approached (unseen by her) through a walk enclosed by tall flowering shrubs. As he issued from it, he perceived his magnet still standing near where he had first seen her, but now in a state of great alarm. The bench, mentioned above, had been taken from its supporters, and one end of it was projecting over the precipitous bank. An eddy in the river had worn away the bank beneath, and the water there was deep and rapid. Little Marie with the instinct which children seem to possess to find, or make danger, had run on to the bench, and when Rosalie stepped on to draw her back she darted forward to its extremity, beyond Rosalie's reach; she perceiving that if she advanced one inch farther the bench would lose its balance and they must both be precipitated into the river. The child perfectly unconscious of danger was diverted at Rosalie's terror, and clapping her hands and jumping up and down was screaming “Why don't you catch me, Rosalie?” The Moorish girl threw herself on her knees and supplicated the child to come back, in vain. Rosalie was pale and trembling with terror, when she felt a firm tread on the bench, behind her, and turning, saw the stranger, who said to her “fear not, sweet lady, give me your hand—I am twice your weight—the board will not move—now advance a step and grasp the little girl.” This was done in an instant, and the mischievous little gypsey was dragged from her tormenting position. Rosalie after she had kissed and chidden her, bade her return with Zeba to the castle, saying she would instantly follow, and then turned to thank the stranger for his timely interposition. A bright flush succeeded her momentary paleness. It may be that the joy of transition from apprehension to security was enhanced by its being effected by a young and handsome stranger-knight, for the young ladies of the middle ages were as richly endowed with the elements of romance as the fair readers of our circulating libraries, who find in many a last new novel but little besides a new compound of the songs of troubadours, and tales of trouveurs. The thanks given, and most graciously received, Rosalie felt embarrassed by the stranger continuing to attend her. “Think me not discourteous, sir knight,” said she, “if I apprise you that you are within the private pleasure grounds of our lady queen—sacred to herself and the ladies of her court.” While Gervais paused for some pretext for lingering, Rosalie kindly added, “I know not how you came here, but I am sure you were heaven-directed.” “Surely then, fair lady, I should follow Heaven's guidance, and not leave the celestial companion vouchsafed me.” “But,” asked Rosalie, smiling, “is not thy mission accomplished?” “It would be profane in me to say so, while I am within superhuman influence.” “Well,” thought Rosalie, “since he persists, there is no harm in permitting him to go as far as the grapery—there we must separate.” Some conversation followed, by which it appeared that the stranger was of the Archbishop of Rheims' household, and Rosalie asked him “if he knew aught of Gervais de Tilbery?” “Aye, lady,” replied Gervais, “both good and evil.” “Evil? I have heard nought but good of him.” “What good can you have heard of one scarce worthy to be named before you?” “This must be sheer envy,” thought Rosalie, but the thought was checked when, glancing her eye at the stranger's face she saw a sweet pleasurable smile there. “Many,” she said, “have brought us report of his knightly feats, and some, who note such matters, of his deeds of mercy. Our ladies call him the handsome knight, and the brave knight, and the kninght of the spotless escutcheon.” “Oh, believe them not—believe them not!” said Gervais, laughing. “Seeing is believing, saith the musty adage,” replied Rosalie. “Gervais de Tilbery is coming to the Chateau des Roses with the Archbishop.” “And is here, most beautiful lady!” cried Gervais, dropping on one knee, “to bless heaven for having granted him this sweet vision—to ask thy name—and to vow eternal fealty.” “Oh, stop—rise, Sir,” said Rosalie, utterly disconcerted and retreating from Gervais, “I am a stranger to thee.” “Nay,” said he, rising, and following her, “I care not for thy name, nor lineage—no rank could grace thee—do not, I beseech you, thus hasten from me— hear my vows.” “You are hasty, Sir,” said Rosalie, drawing up her little person with a dignity that awed Gervais; “and now I think of it—have I not heard that it was your purpose to enter the church?” Gervais became suddenly as grave as Rosalie could have wished. “It was my purpose,” he replied, in a voice scarcely audible. “Then you are already bound by holy vows.” “Not yet—the ceremony of the tonsure is appointed for the festival of St. Catharine.” “St. Catharine!” Rosalie's exclamation was involuntary. Her own purposed vow recurred to her, and she may be pardoned if she (being sixteen) deemed the coincidence a startling one. They proceeded together: Gervais, in spite of her remonstrances, attending her through the grapery to the garden gate, where Marie stood awaiting her. “Come in, Rose—come in,” said the impatient child, “and you, sir stranger, go back—I hate you, and mama will hate you for stealing away my Rose.” So saying, she shut the gate in poor Gervais's face, before he had time to speak, or even look a farewell to Rosalie. He had leisure, during his long, circuitous walk to the castle, to meditate on his adventure, to see bright visions of the future, and to decide, if necessary to sacrifice the course of ambition opened by the Archbishop's patronage to the attainment of Rosalie. Gervais de Tilbery was of noble birth; a richly endowed, gay, light-hearted youth, who was guided by his impulses; but, fortunately, they were the impulses of a nature that seemed, like a fine instrument, to have been ordained and fitted to good uses by its author. A word in apology of his sudden passion, and its immediate declaration: In that dark æra when woman was sought (for the most part) only for her beauty, a single view was enough to decide the choice; the wife was elected as suddenly as one would now pronounce on the beauty of a fabric or a statue. Gervais de Tilbery, for the first time in his life, felt that woman was a compound being, and that within the exquisite material frame, there dwelt a spirit that consecrated the temple. It was on the evening of the day following Rosalie's meeting with the young knight, that Clotilde was officiating at her daughter's toilette. She was preparing for a masked ball, where she was to appear as a nymph of Diana. She was dressed in a light green china silk robe, fitted with exquisite skill to a form so vigorous, graceful and agile, that it seemed made for sylvan sports. Her luxuriant hair was drawn, à la Grecque, into a knot of curls behind, and fastened by a small silver arrow. A silver whistle, suspended by a chain of the same material, richly wrought, hung from her girdle. Her delicate feet were buskined, her arms bare. She had a silver bow in her hand, and to her shoulder was attached a small quiver of the finest silver net-work, filled with arrows. After her mother had finished her office of tire-woman, which she would permit none to share with her, and before tying on Rosalie's mask, she gazed at her with a feeling of pride and irrepressible triumph. A sigh followed this natural swelling of her heart. “Why that sigh, dear mother?” asked Rosalie. “I sighed, my child, to think how little you appear in this heathen decoration, like a promised votary of the blessed Virgin.” “Not promised,” replied Rosalie hastily, and blushing deeply. “Not quite promised, my child, but meditated.” “Mother,” said Rosalie and paused, for the first time in her life hesitating to open her heart to her parent; but the good impulse prevailed, and she proceeded. “Mother, in truth the more I meditate on that, the less am I inclined to it.” “Rosalie!” “So it is, dear mother; and is it not possible that you directed me to defer the vow in obedience to a heavenly intimation?—I have thought it might be so.” Clotilde fixed her penetrating eye on Rosalie's. “There is something new in your mind, Rosalie; keep it not back from me, my child; be it weakness or sin, I shall sorrow with, not blame you.” “It may be weakness, mother, but I am sure it is not sin. I told you of my meeting with Gervais de Tilbery, in la Vigne.” “Yes, and of his rescuing our little Marie, but nought else.” “There was not much else—and yet his words and looks, and not my vow to the Virgin, have been in my mind ever since.” Rosalie, after a little stammering and blushing, gave her mother a faithful relation of every particular of the meeting, and though she most dreaded her mother's comments on that part of her story, she did not disguise that Gervais was destined for holy orders. Her mother embraced her, and thanked her for her confidence. “Dear child,” she said, “forewarned, I trust you will be forearmed. This young Gervais will see no barrier to his pursuit of you in the holy vows he assumes. The indulgence and absolutions of our corrupted church license all sin; but we are not thus taught of the Scriptures, whose spiritual essence has entered into hearts that we believe marriage, even performed with all holy ceremony and legal rites, is not permitted to the saint, albeit allowed to human infirmity.” “I always believe what you say to me, mother; yet”— “Yet—speak freely, Rosalie.” “Yet it does seem to me incomprehensible, that the relation should be wrong, from which proceeds the tie that binds you to me and me to you; which opens a fountain of love that in its course is always becoming sweeter and deeper—hark! the bell is sounding—I must hasten to the queen's saloon—tie on my mask, and be assured no mask shall ever hide a thought or feeling from you, my mother.” “Go, my sweet child, remember pleasure enervates the soul, and be watchful—I remain to pray for you.” How did the aspect and the spirit of the scene change to Rosalie, from the quiet apartment of her saintly mother, to the queen's saloon brilliantly illuminated, filled with the flower of French chivalry and with the court beauties, whom the lady Agnes, either from a real passion for what was loveliest in nature, or to show how far her conjugal security was above all envy, delighted to assemble about her in great numbers. She was seated at the king's right hand, under a canopy of crimson and gold. The king was in his royal robes, and both he and the lady Agnes were without masks. She was dressed in the character of Ceres, and her rich and ripened beauty personified admirably the Queen of Summer. Her crown (an insignia which, probably from her contested right to it, she was careful never to omit,) was of diamonds and gold, formed into wheat-heads, the diamonds representing the berry, and the gold the stem and beard. Her robe was of the finest Flanders cloth, glittering with embroidery, depicting the most beautiful productions of the earth which, as her ample train followed her, seemed to spring up at her tread. The young Philip sat at his father's feet on an embroidered cushion, Marie at her mother's, both personifying Bacchantes. The ladies of the court, in the costume of nymphs, muses, and graces, were at the queen's right hand; the lords and knights, in various fantastical characters, at the king's left. It was suspected, from several persons wearing the symbols of a holy profession, that the Archbishop's party was present, but as he was precise in observances, and severe in discipline to cruelty, none ventured to assert it. Rosalie was met at the door by one of the appointed attendants, and led to the lady Agnes' side, a station always assigned her as the favourite of her mistress. “Ah, my little nymph of the chase,” said the queen, as Rosalie knelt at her feet and lay down her bow in token of homage, “you are a rebel to-night; what has Ceres to do with Diana's followers?” “True,” said a young knight who had a pilgrim's staff in his hand, “one is the bountiful mother, and the other the nun of mythology—more unkind than the nun, for she does not immure the charms which it is profanity to admire.” “Gervais de Tilbery,” thought Rosalie, instantly recognising his voice, “your words seem to me prophetic.” “There is no false assumption in this character of yours,” continued the pilgrim knight, “for the arrow loosed from thy bow is sure to pierce thy victim's heart.” “Hush all!” cried the queen. “Our minstrel begins, and our ears would drink his strain, for his is the theme welcomest and dearest.” Philip Augustus, as in some sort the founder of the feudal monarchy, has made an epoch in history. His reign seemed to his subjects to revive the glorious era of Charlemagne. It was the dawn of a brilliant day after a sleep of four centuries. He enlarged and consolidated his dominions. France, till his reign, had been divided into four kingdoms, of which that governed by the French king was the smallest. He made a new era in the arts and sciences. He founded colleges and erected edifices which are still the pride of France. Notre Dame was reconstructed and enlarged by him. He conveyed pure water by aqueducts to the city of Paris, and in his reign that city was first paved and redeemed from a pestilential condition. His cruelties, his intolerance, and his infidelities were the vices of his age. His beneficent acts were a just theme of praise, but that which made him an inspiring subject to his poet laureate minstrel was his passion for chivalric institutions, his love of the romances of chivalry, and the patronage with which he rewarded the inventive genius of the Trouveres. “In truth,” says his historian, “it was during his reign that this brilliant creation of the imagination, (chivalry,) was in some sort complete.”—The court minstrel, with such fertile themes, sung long, and concluded amidst a burst of applause. The dancing began, and again and again the pilgrim knight was seen dancing with Diana's nymph. “Ah, Gervais!” whispered a young man to him, “she of the silver-net quiver is I suspect your houri. A dangerous preparation this for your canonicals.” U “Why so, Arnaud? Do angels never minister to priests?” “Never, my friend, in such forms,” replied Arnaud, laughing. “Then heaven forfend that I should be a priest!” A Dominican friar, in mask, approached Gervais, and said in a startling voice, “Thou art rash, young man —thou hast lain aside thy badge of sanctity,” alluding to his pilgrim's staff. “What signifies it, good friar,” replied Gervais, “if I part with the sign, so long as I retain the thing signified? I am not yet a priesl.” “Have a care, sir,” replied the friar, in a tone that indicated he was deeply offended by Gervais's slur upon the priesthood, “speak not lightly of the office that hath a divine commission!” “And assumes divine power, good master friar!” The friar turned away, murmuring something of which Gervais heard only the words “edge tools.” His mind was full of other matters, and they would have made no impression, had not his friend Arnaud whispered to him, as soon as the friar was again lost in the crowd, “Are you mad, Gervais? Knew you not the Archbishop?” “The Archbishop!—in that humble suit, how should I?”—“N'importe,” added the gay youth, after a moment's panic, “the devil, as the proverb says, must hear truth if he listens.” “And the proverb tells us too, to `bow to the bush we get shelter from.”' “My thanks to you, Arnaud. I have changed my mind, and shall not seek the bush's shelter. “Then beware! for that which might have afforded shelter, may distil poison.” “Away with you and your croaking, Arnaud. This night is dedicated to perfect happiness, and you shall not mar it.” “Alas, my friend!—the brightest day is often followed by the darkest night.” But Gervais heard not this word of prophecy. The dance was finished, and he was leading off his beautiful partner. She permitted him to conduct her through the open suite of apartments, each one less brilliantly illuminated than the last, till they reached an apartment with a single lamp, and one casement window which opened upon a balcony that overlooked the garden. The transition was a delicious one from the heated and crowded apartments, to the stillness of nature, and the privity of moonlight—from the stifling atmosphere to the incense that rose from the unnumbered flowers of the garden beneath them. Rosalie involuntarily threw aside her mask, and disclosed a face, lit as it was by the sweet emotions and enthusiasm of the occasion, more beautiful than the memory and imagination of the enraptured lover had pictured it. It was a moment when love would brook no counsel from prudence; and Gervais, obeying his impulses, poured out his passion in a strain to which Rosalie, in a few, faintly spoken words, replied. The tone and the words sunk to the very depths of Gervais's heart, assuring him that he was beloved. An hour flew, while to the young lovers all the world but themselves seemed annihilated—then followed the recollection of certain relations and dependencies of this mortal life. “My first care shall be,” said Gervais, “to recede from this priesthood.” “Thank kind heaven for that,” replied Rosalie. “As they say in Provence, `any thing is better than a priest.”' The lovers both fancied they heard a rustling near them. They turned their heads, and Gervais stepped within the embrasure of the window. “It is nothing —we are unobserved,” he said, returning to Rosalie's side. “But tell me, my Rosalie, (my Rosalie!) where heard you this Provence scandal?” “From my dear mother, who spent her youth at the court of the good Raymond.” “St. Denis aid us! I believed Treres, Gui, and Regnier had plucked up heresy by the roots in Languedoc. Heaven forbid that she be infected with heresy!” “I know not what you call heresy, Sir Gervais de Tilbery, but my dear mother drinks at the fountain of truth, the Scriptures, and receives not her faith from man, be he called bishop, archbishop, or pope.” “By all the saints, I believe she has reason in that. But, dear Rosalie, we will eschew heresy—it is a thorny road to heaven, and we will keep the safe path our fathers have trodden before us, in which there are guides who relieve us of all the trouble of self-direction—will we not?” “My mother is my guide, Sir Gervais.” “So be it, my lovely Rosalie, till her guidance is transferred to me—and thereafter you will be faithful to God, St. Peter, and the Romish Church? And when shall your orthodoxy begin—on St. Catharine's Eve?” “I know not—I know not. All these matters must be referred to my dear mother and the queen. Rise, Sir Gervais, (her lover had knelt to urge his suit)— we linger too long here.” Again there was a sound near them, and Gervais sprang forward to ascertain whence it proceeded—Rosalie followed him, and they both perceived the figure of the friar crossing the threshhold of the next apartment. “Could he have been here?” exclaimed Gervais—“he might have been hidden behind the folds of this curtain—but would he?” Gervais paused,—“Whom do you mean?” “The friar,” answered Gervais, warily, for he feared to alarm Rosalie by the intimation of the possibility that the Archbishop of Rheims had overheard their conversation. Rosalie did not sleep that night till she had confided all, without the reservation of a single particular, to her mother. The lady Clotilde grieved that she must resign her cherished, dearest hope of seeing Rosalie self-devoted to a vestal's life, but true to her spiritual faith, that all virtue and all religion were in the mind, and of the mind, she would not persuade—she would not influence Rosalie to an external piety. She saw much advantage would result to Rosalie from an alliance with Gervais. It would remove her at once and forever from the contagion of the court atmosphere—from lady Agnes's influence, so intoxicating to a young and confiding nature. Gervais was of noble rank and fortune, and when that distinction was almost singular among the young nobles of France, he was distinguished for pure morals. “It is possible,” thought Clotilde, as she revolved in her mind all the good she had heard of him, “that the renovating Spirit of Truth has already entered his heart. It has not pleased heaven to grant my prayer, but next best to what I vainly asked, is this union of pure and loving hearts.” The ingenuous disclosure Rosalie had made, awakened in her mind a vivid recollection of a similar experience of her youth, and produced a sympathetic feeling that perhaps, more than her reason, governed her decision. Rosalie that night fell asleep on her mother's bosom with the sweet assurance that her love was authorized. The next was a busy, an important, and a happy day to the lovers. “Time trod on flowers.” Alas, the periods of perfect happiness are brief, and one might say with the fated Moor— “If it were now to die 'Twere now to be most happy; for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute, That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate.” Every thing seemed to go well and as it should. The Archbishop, with a gloomy brow, but without one U 2 comment or hesitating word, acquiesced in Gervais's relinquishing his purpose of entering the church. The lady Agnes, loath to part with her favourite, yet graciously gave her consent, and persuaded the king to endow the young bride richly, and even the little Marie, though she at first stoutly and with showers of tears, refused to give up her own Rose, yet was at last brought over to the party of the lovers, by the promise of officiating as bridesmaid on St. Catharine's Eve. Would that we could end our tale here; but the tragic truth which darkens the page of history must not be suppressed. The Archbishop of Rheims was devoted to the aggrandizement of his own order—to extending and securing the dominion of the priesthood. His faith might be called sincere, but we should hardly excuse that man who, having been born and educated in a dark room, should spend his whole life in counteracting the efforts of others to communicate the light of heaven to him, and in stopping the little crevices by which it might enter. He was ready to grant any indulgence to errors, or even vices, that did not interfere with the supremacy of the church. He was the uncle of Philip, and, contrary to his inclination, he had been induced by that powerful monarch to countenance him in his rejection of the queen Isemburg, and had thereby involved himself in an unwilling contest with Innocent III. This pontiff, whose genius, his historian says, “embraced and governed the world,” was equally incapable of compromise and pity. He had a few years antecedent to the events we have related, proclaimed the first crusade against the Albigeois, and had invested the dignitaries of the church throughout Christendom with the power “to burn the chiefs (of the new opinions) to disperse their followers, and to confiscate the property of all that did not think as he did. All exercise of the faculty of thinking in religious matters was forbidden.” The Archbishop of Rheims was eager to wipe out his offences against the head of the church by his zealous co-operation with him in this persecution. As has been seen, he was nettled by Gervais's contemptuous hit at the priesthood. It was an indication that the disease of heresy had touched even the healthiest members of the spiritual body, as the general prevalence of corresponding symptoms announced the approach of a wide wasting epidemic. He became restless and uneasy, and, in wandering alone through the apartments of the chateau, he had found his way to the window of the balcony occupied by our lovers, just in time to hear poor Rosalie's betrayal of her mother. He devoted the following day to a secret inquisition into the life and conversation of Clotilde. He found that she had long ceased to be a favourite of the lady Agnes, who tolerated her only on account of her daughter, and who felt somewhat the same aversion to her (and for analogous reasons) that Herodias cherished against John the Baptist. This feeling of the lady Agnes was rather discerned by the acute prelate than expressed by her, for there was not a fault of which she could accuse the pure and devout woman. Her offences were the rigid practice of every moral virtue. Her time and her fine faculties were all devoted to the benefit of her fellow-creatures, so that she fell under the common condemnation, as set forth by a contemporary writer. “L'esprit de mensonge, par la seule apparence d'une vie nette, et sans tache, soustrayoit ces inprudens à la verite. Besides this, she was found deficient in the observance of the Romish ritual, and she ate no meat. This last sin of omission, being in accordance with the practice of the strictest among those early reformers, was an almost infallible sign of heresy; and on the day following the arrangements for Rosalie's marriage, the lady Clotilde was summoned before the Archbishop and a council of priests. Her guilt was assumed, and she was questioned upon the several points of the prevailing heresy. We cannot go into details. Our story has already swelled beyond due bounds. The lady Clotilde, unsupported and alone, answered all the questions of her inquisitors, with a directness, simplicity, a comprehension of the subject, and a modesty, that, as a cotemporary chronicler confesses, astounded all who heard her. But it availed nought. She was convicted of denying the right of the Romish church to grant indulgences and absolution, and, in short, of wholly rejecting its authority. The Archbishop condemned her as deserving the penalty of death, and the pains of everlasting fire, but he offered her pardon upon a full recantation of her errors. “I fear not him who only can kill the body,” she replied, with blended firmness and gentleness, “but Him who can destroy both soul and body, and to Him,” she added, raising her eyes and folding her hands, “I commend that spirit to which it hath pleased Him to vouchsafe the glorious liberty of the gospel.” Her celestial calmness awed her judges—even the Archbishop hesitated for a moment to pronounce her doom, when a noise and altercation with the guard was heard at the door. It opened, and Rosalie rushed in, threw herself into her mother's arms, and all natural timidity, all fear of the tribunal before which she stood, merged in one overwhelming apprehension, she demanded, “what they were doing, and why her mother was there?” “Peace, rash child!” answered the Archbishop. “Shame on thy intrusion—know that thy mother is a convicted heretic.” “What wrong has she ever done? Who has dared to accuse my mother?” cried Rosalie, still clinging to Clotilde, who in vain tried to hush and calm her. “Who was her accuser?” retorted the Archbishop, with a cruel sneer—“dost thou remember, foolish girl, who revealed the source of the Provence scandal?” The recollection of the sound she had heard during her fatal conversation with Gervais in the balcony, at once flashed upon Rosalie. She elevated her person, and, stretching out her arm towards the Archbishop, exclaimed, with ineffable indignation, “Thou wert the listener?” For an instant his cheeks and lips were blanched with shame, and then stifling this honest rebuke of conscience, he quoted the famous axiom of Innocent III.—“Dost thou not know, girl, that `it is to be deficient in faith, to keep faith with those that have no faith?'—Stand back, and hear the doom of all those who renounce the Romish church.” “Pronounce the doom, then, on me too!” cried Rosalie, kneeling and clasping her hands. “I too renounce it—I hate it—I deny all my mother denies— I believe all she believes.” “Oh Rosalie!—my child!—my child!” exclaimed her mother. “My lord Archbishop, she is wild— she knows not what she says.” “Mother, I do!—have you not taught me?—have we not prayed and wept together over the holy gospels, so corrupted and perverted by the priesthood?” “Enough!” said the Archbishop—“be assured we will not cut down the dry tree, and leave the green one to flourish.” “Thanks!—then we shall die together,” said Rosalie, locking her arms around her mother's neck. The delirious excitement had exhausted her—her head fell on her mother's bosom, and she was an unconscious burden in her arms. Clotilde laid her on a cushion at her feet, and knelt by her while the Archbishop, after a few words of consultation, doomed the mother and daughter “to pass through material to immaterial flames,” on St. Catharine's day. They were together conveyed to a dungeon appertaining to the chateau. St. Catharine's Eve arrived. The hour that had been destined for Rosalie's bridals found her in a dungeon, seated at her mother's feet, her head resting on her mother's breast, and her eyes fixed on her face, while Clotilde read by the light of their lamp the fourteenth chapter of St. John. She closed the book. The calmness that she had maintained till then forsook her. She laid her face to Rosalie's, and the tears from her cheeks dropped on her child's. “Oh!” she exclaimed, nature subduing the firmness of the martyr, “it is in vain! I read, and pray, and meditate, but still my “heart is troubled”—the spirit is not willing.” “Dear mother!” cried Rosalie, feeling as if the columns against which she leaned were tottering. “My child, it is not for myself I fear or feel. My mission on earth is finished—and I have an humble, but assured hope, that my Saviour will accept that which I have done in his service. For me death has no terrors. I should rejoice in the flames that would consume this earthly tabernacle and set my spirit free; but oh, my child!” She closed her eyes as if she would exclude the dreadful vision, “when I think of thy sweet body devoured by elemental fire my heart fails. I am tempted, sorely tempted. I fear that in that hour I shall deny the faith, and give up heaven for your life.” “Mother, mother, do not say so. I hoped it was only I had sinful thoughts, and affections binding me to earth.” The weakness of nature for a moment triumphed over the sublime power of religion, and the mother and child wept, and sobbed violently. So absorbed were they in their emotions that they did not hear the turning of the bolts of their prison, nor were they conscious of any one's approach till Rosalie's name was pronounced in a low voice; when they both started and saw, standing before them, Gervais de Tilbery, the lady Agnes and her confessor. Gervais threw himself on his knees before Rosalie, took her hand and pressed it to his lips. She returned the pressure, but spoke not. “There is no time to be lost, my dear friends,” said the lady Agnes. “Clotilde,” she continued, “I have vainly begged the boon of your life—it is denied me —but your child's—yours—my own dear Rosalie, I can preserve. It boots not now to say by what means I shall effect it.” “Can she live,” cried Clotilde vehemently, “without renouncing her faith? without denying her Lord?” “Without any condition but that she now give her hand to Gervais de Tilbery—the priest is ready.” “Oh tempt me not! tempt me not,” exclaimed Rosalie, throwing herself on her mother's bosom. “I will not leave her. I will die with her.” “Hear me, my child,” said her mother in a voice so firm, sweet, and tranquillizing that it spoke peace to the storm in Rosalie's bosom. “Hear me. I have already told you that for myself this dispensation has no terror, but my spirit shrinks from your enduring it —spare me, my child. God has condescended to my weakness and opened for you a way of escape—do you still hesitate? On my knees, Rosalie, I beg you to live —not for Gervais—not for yourself—for me—for your mother—give me your hand.” Rosalie gave it. Now God bless thee my child—shield thee from temptation and deliver thee from evil! She put Rosalie's hand into Gervais's, and bidding the priest do his office, she supported her child on one side while Gervais sustained her on the other. Rosalie looked more like a bride for heaven than earth, her face as pale as the pure white she wore, and her lips faintly, and inaudibly, repeating the marriage vows. As the ceremony proceeded, her mother whispered again, and again, “courage my child! courage! It is for my sake, Rosalie.” The priest pronounced the benediction. Rosalie had lost all consciousness. Her mother folded her in one fond, long protracted embrace, and then, without one word, resigned her to Gervais. The lady Agnes signed to the priest. A female attendant appeared. Rosalie was enveloped in a travelling cloak and hood and conveyed out of the prison. Clotilde remained alone. We may say, without presumption, that angels came and ministered to her. We have only to add the conclusion of the cotemporary record. “One of the condemned escaped from punishment, and it is maintained that she was carried off by the devil; the other without shedding a tear or uttering a complaint submitted to death with a courage that equalled her modesty.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">X ROMANCE IN REAL LIFE. “La Nature fait le mérite, La Fortune le met in preuve.” Many fortunate travellers on the western border of Massachusetts, and not many miles from the Hudson, have been refreshed at the inn of Reliance Reynolds. Reliance, as his name indicates, was born in the good old times. We are aware that the enthusiasts about the “progress of the age,” deny this golden period any but a retrospective existence, and maintain that, retrace the steps of the human family far as you will, it is like the age of chivalry, always a little behind you. But we adhere to the popular phraseology, and call those “good old times,” when the Puritanical nomenclature prevailed; when such modest graces as faith and temperance had not been expelled from our taverns, kitchens, and workshops, by the heroes and heroines of romance—the Orlandos and Lorenzos, Rosamonds and Anna Matildas. Reliance belonged to the “good old times,” too, in the more essential matter of downright honesty, simplicity and respectful courtesy. His was a rare character in New England—a passive spirit, content to fill and fit the niche nature had prepared for him. It was not very high, but he never aspired above it; nor very low, but he never sank below it. He was the marvel of his neighbours, for he could never be persuaded into an enterprise or speculation. He never bought a water privilege, nor an oar bed; subscribed to a county bank, or “moved to the West;” or in any mode indicated that principle in man, which, in its humble operations, is restlessness,—in its lofty aspirations, a longing after immortality. Reliance's desires never passed the bounds of his premises, and were satisfied, even within them, with a very moderate share of power. He stood at his door, his hat in his hand, to receive his guests; he strictly performed the promise of his sign, and gave “good entertainment to man and horse;” he rendered a moderate bill and received his dues with a complacent smile, in which gratitude was properly tempered with a just sense of his own rights. In short, as must be already quite manifest, Reliance, though a pattern landlord, is a very poor subject for a storyteller; his qualities, like the colours in a ray of light, all blending and forming one hue, and his life, presenting the same monotonous harmony. We should not have forced him from his happy obscurity into the small degree of notoriety he may incur on our humble page, but for his being the adjunct of his wife, an important personage in our narrative. Mrs. Reynolds, too, like her husband, performed exactly the duties of her station. She never perhaps read a line of poetry, save such as might lurk in the “Poet's Corner” of a village paper, but her whole life was an illustration of the oldfashioned couplet— “Honour and shame from no condition rise, Act well your part, there all the honour lies.” She never was presidentess of a “society for ameliorating the condition of the Jews,” or secretary or treasurer of any of those beneficent associations that rescue the latent talents of women from obscurity and mettrent en scene gems and flowers that might otherwise shine and exhale unnoticed and unknown; but though humble was her name and destiny, her memory is dear to the wayfaring. Quiet, order, and neatness, reigned at her bed and board. No pirates harboured in her bedsteads, no bad luck, that evil genius of housewives, curdled her cream, spoiled her butter or her bread, but her table was spread with such simple, wholesome fare as might have lit a smile on the wan visage of an old dyspeptic; and this we take to be the greatest achievement of the gastronomic art. With the duties of life so peacefully and so well performed, our good hostess ought, according to all the rules of happiness, to have been happy; but it is our melancholy duty to confess she was not, and to explain the cause. She had been married many years without having any children; that blessed possession that, in transmitting the parent's existence, seems to extend its bounds, and to render even here, the mortal immortal. In addition to the feeling, common to all women, who naturally crave the sweetest objects for their tenderest and strongest affections, Mrs. Reynolds lamented her childless state with a bitterness of repining approaching to that of the Hebrew wives. With everything else in her possession that could inspire contentment, her mind was fixed on this one desired good, and, like Hannah of old, she was still a “woman of sorrowful spirit.” She had endeavoured to solace herself with the children of her kindred, and several, from time to time, had been adopted into her family; but some proved disagreeable, and others homesick, and there was always a paramount duty or affection that interfered with her's, till finally her almost extinguished hopes were gratified, and Providence gave her a child worthy all her care and love.[7] [7] We would gladly have had it in our power to be exact in dates, as our story in good faith is true in all, even the least important particulars. Some few circumstances, and the “spoken words,” had escaped tradition, and of course were necessarily supplied, as the proper statue receives a foot or finger from the ruder hand of modern art. The name of the heroine having been subsequently merged and forgotten in that of her husband, we have ventured to retain it. The rest we have respectfully veiled under assumed appellations. In the autumn of 1777, two travellers arrived just at nightfall at Reynolds's inn. Its aspect was inviting; situated in the heart of a fertile valley that had lately been refreshed by the early rains of autumn, and in its bright garb resembling a mature beauty that had happily harmonized some youthful tints with her soberer graces. A sprightly, winding stream gave life and music to the meadows. On every side the landscape was undulating and fertile, but not then as extensively cultivated as now, when, to the Tauconnuc on the south, and the lofty blue outline of the Catskills on the west, the eye ranges over a rich and enjoyed country. Beside the accidental charm of a pretty landscape, the inn had advantages peculiar to itself. Instead of being placed on the roadside, as most of our taverns are—for what reason we know not, unless a cloud of travellers' dust be typical of a shower of gold to the vision of mine host—Reynolds's inn was separated from the highway by a court yard, shaded by two wide spreading elms, and enlivened with a profusion of autumnal flowers, marigolds, cockscombs, and china asters. There was nothing that indicated any claims to particular civility in the appearance of our travellers. They were well looking and respectably apparelled; and, accordingly, having announced their determination to remain for the night, they were shown to an inner room, the parlour, par excellence, where Mrs. Reynolds appeared, and having opened a door which admitted the balmy air and a view of the western sky, just then brightened by the tints of the setting sun, she received their orders for their supper, and retired without one of those remarks or inquiries by which it is usual, on such occasions, to give vent to curiosity. Nothing passed between our travellers in the dull interval that elapsed before their meal was ready, to give to our readers the least clue to their origin or destiny. One of them lulled himself into a doze in the rocking chair, while the other, younger and more active and vivacious, amused himself out of doors, plucking flowers, X 2 enraging an old petulant cock turkey, and mocking the scolding of some Guinea hens, the Xantippes of the feathered race. The interval was not long. The door opened and the tea table was brought in, already spread (a mode we wish others would adopt from our pattern landlady), and spread in a manner to characterize our bountiful country. What a contrast does the evening meal of our humblest inn present to the leanness of an English tea table! A cornucopia would have been the appropriate symbol for Mrs. Reynolds's table. There were beef steaks, and ham and eggs; hot cakes and toast; bread and gingerbread; all the indigenous cakes, such as crullers and nuteakes, &amp;c.; honey, sweet-meats, apple sauce, cheese, pickles, and an afterpiece of pies. Kind reader, do not condemn our bill of fare as impertinent and vulgar. We put it down to show the scared political economists, that, with us, instead of the population pressing on the means of subsistence, the means of subsistence presses on the population. Our travellers fell to their repast with appetites whetted by a long fast and a day's ride. Not a word was spoken, till a little girl, who was sitting on the doorstep caressing a tame pigeon, perceiving that one of the guests had garnished his buttonhole with a bunch of marigolds, plucked a rose from a monthly rose bush, trained over a trellis at the door, and laid it beside his plate. He seemed struck with the modest offering, and, turning with a look of gratitude to the child, he patted her on her head, and exclaimed instinctively, “Merci, merci, ma petite!” and then correcting himself, he said, in very imperfect English, “I thank you, my little girl.” The child's attention was fixed by the first word he uttered, and as he addressed his companion in French, her countenance indicated more emotion than would naturally have been excited by the simple circumstance of hearing, for the first time, a foreign language. “Qu'elle est belle, cette petite,” he continued, turning to his companion; “c'est la beaute de mon pays —voila, brunette, et les yeux, si grands, si noirs, et la tournure aussi—quelle grâce, quelle vivacite! Ah! Monsieur, Monsieur, c'est tout-à-fait Fran çoise.” As he proceeded the child advanced nearer to him. She shook back the rich, dark curls that shaded her face, bent her head forward, half parted her bright lips, and listened with the uncertain and eager expression of one who is catching a half remembered tune, the key to a thousand awakening recollections. It was evident that she did not comprehend the purport of the words, and that it was the sound alone to which her delighted ear was stretched. A smile played about her lips, and tears gathered in her eyes, and there seemed to be a contrariety of emotions confounding even to herself; but that which finally prevailed was indicated by her throwing her apron over her head, and retreating to the doorstep, where she sat down, and for some moments, vainly attempted to stifle her sobs. She had just become tranquil, when Mrs. Reynolds entered. The elder traveller said, in an interrogating tone, “That is your child, ma'am?” “I call her mine,” was the brief and not very satisfactory reply. “She resembles neither you nor your husband,” resumed the traveller. “No; she does not favour us.” “I fancied she had a French look.” “I can't say as to that,” replied the landlady; “I never saw any French people.” “My friend here is a Frenchman,” pursued the traveller, “and the little girl listened to him so intently, that I thought it possible she might understand him.” “No, I guess she did not sense him,” replied Mrs. Reynolds, with an air of indifference; and then turning hastily to the child, “Mary,” she said, “there is more company; go and see if your father does not want you.” She went and did not return. Mrs. Reynolds herself removed the table. The elder gentleman sat down to write a letter; while the Frenchman walked to and fro, opened the doors, and peeped in every direction to get a glimpse of the little girl, who seemed to have taken complete possession of his imagination. Once, as she ran through the passage, he called to her “Doucement! doucement! mon petit ange”—she stopped as if she were glued to the floor. “How call you your name, my dear?” “Mary Reynolds, sir.” “Then Madame there, Mistress Reynolds is your maman?” “She is”— “Mary, what are you staying for? Here—this instant!” screamed Mrs. Reynolds from the kitchen door, in a tone that admitted no delay, and the child ran off without finishing her sentence. “C'est bien singulier!” muttered the Frenchman. “What do you find so singular, Jaubert!” asked his companion, who had just finished his letter, and thrown down his pen. “Oh! it is nothing—perhaps—but”— “`But,' what, my friend?” “Why, there seems to me some mystery about this child; something in her manner, I know not what, that stirs up strange thoughts and hopes in my mind. She is not one of the pale, blonde beauties of your climate.” “Ah! my good friend, we have all sorts of beauties in our clime. All nations, you know, have sent us their contributions. The blue eye and fair skin, the Saxon traits, certainly prevail in our Eastern States; but you know we border on New York, the asylum of the dark eyed Huguenots, and it is not impossible that to this child may have been transmitted the peculiarities of some French ancestor. Nothing is more common than a resemblance between a descendant and a far off progenitor.” “Ah! it is not only the French, the Norman aspect, the—do not ridicule me—the Angely traits that attract me; but you yourself noticed how she listened to my language, and then this Mistress Reynolds does not say she is her child, but only she calls her so.” “Pshaw! Is that all? It is the way of my country people, Jaubert; their indirectness is proverbial. If one of them were to say “yes” or “no,” you might suspect some deep mystery. I confess I was at first startled with the little girl's emotion, but I soon perceived it was nothing but shame and embarrassment at the curiosity she had betrayed. I see how it is, Jaubert; fruitless and hopeless as is our search, you cannot bear to relinquish it, and are looking for some coup de thèâtre—some sudden transition from disappointment to success.” We have put into plain English a conversation that was supported in French, and was now broken off by the approach of Mrs. Reynolds, who came to tell the travellers their bedrooms were ready. By the light of the candle she brought, she discovered Mary concealed in a corner of the passage close to the door, where, in breathless stillness, she had been listening. “You here, Mary!” exclaimed the good woman; “I thought you had been in bed this half hour. You will make me angry with you, Mary, if you do not mind me better than this,” she added in an under tone, and the child stole away, but without looking either very penitent or very fearful; and in truth she had cause for neither penitence nor fear, for she had only gratified an innocent and almost irrepressible inclination, and as to Dame Reynolds's anger, it was never formidable. The travellers retired to their respective apartments, and while the landlady lingered to adjust her parlour, the letter that had been left on the table caught her eye. Nothing could be more natural than for her to look at the superscription. Painfully she spelt out the first line. “A Monsieur, Monsieur”—but when she came to the next, her eye was rivetted, “St. Jean Angely de Crève-Cœur.” After gazing on it till she had made assurance doubly sure, she was hastening to her husband to participate the discovery with him, when, apparently changing her intentions, she retreated, bolted the door, and returned to the examination of the letter. It was unsealed. Reluctant to open it, she compromised with her conscience, and peeped in at both ends, but the writing was not perceptible, and her interest overcoming her scruples, she unfolded the letter. Alas! it was in French. In vain her eye ran over the manuscript to catch some words that might serve as clues to the rest. There was nothing in all the three pages she could comprehend, but “arrivé à New York”—“la rivière d'Hudson”—“le manoir de Livingston.” She was refolding the letter, when the following postscript, inadvertently written in English, caught her eye; “As we have no encouragement to proceed farther in our search, and Jean and Avenel are all impatience, Jaubert will embark in the Neptune, which is to sail on the first.” A gleam of pleasure shot across Mrs. Reynolds's face, but it soon darkened again with anxiety and perplexity. “Why did I open the letter?” she asked herself. “Why did I look at it at all? But nobody will ever know that I have seen it unless I tell it myself; and why should I tell?” A burst of tears concluded this mental interrogation, and proved that, however earnestly her heart might plead before the tribunal of conscience, yet the stern decision of that unerring judge was heard. Self-interest has a hard task when it would mystify the path of one who habitually walks by the clear light of truth straight onward in the path of duty. It may seem unnatural to the inexperienced, that Mrs. Reynolds did not communicate her embarrassment and irresolution, from whatever cause they proceeded, to her husband; but she well knew what would be the result of a consultation; for he, good man, never viewed a subject but from one position, and we are all slow to ask advice that we foresee will be counter to our wishes. Mrs. Reynolds, so far then from appealing to the constituted authority of her household, locked her discovery within her own bosom, and, to avoid all suspicion and inquiry, she composed herself as soon as possible, and retired to her bed, but not to sleep; and at peep of dawn, she was up and prepared to obtain all the satisfaction that indirect interrogation could procure from the travellers, and her mental resolution, invigorated by a night's solitary reflection, was “to act up to her light.” They had ordered breakfast at a very early hour, and she took care to be the only person in attendance on them. When they were seated at table, she placed herself in a rocking chair behind them, a position that happily reconciles the necessity of service with the dignity of independence, and began her meditated approaches, by saying to her own countryman, “I believe you left a letter here last night, sir; I laid it in the cupboard for fear of accidents.” “Thank you, ma'am; I ought to have been more careful. It was a letter of some consequence.” “Indeed! Well, I was thinking it might be.” “Ah! what made you think so?” Now we must premise, that neither of the parties speaking knew anything of that sensitiveness that starts from a question as if an attack were made on private property; but they possessed, in common, the good-natured communicativeness that is said to characterize the New England people, who, in their colloquial traffic, as in other barter, hold exchange to be no robbery. Most women are born diplomatists, and Mrs. Reynolds took care to reply to the last interrogatory so carefully as not to commit herself. “It stands to reason,” she said, “a letter that is to go all the way over the wide sea to the old countries, should be of consequence.” “Yes—it is a long voyage.” “You have taken it yourself, perhaps, sir? “I have. I went out an officer on board one of our cruisers, and was wrecked on the coast of France.” “Of France! Well, we are hand and glove with the French now; but I tell my husband it seems to me like joining with our enemies against those of our own household.” “Ah! Mrs. Reynolds, `friends are sometimes better than kindred.' I am sure my own father's son could not have been kinder to me than was Monsieur Angely de Creve-Cœur—hey, Jaubert?” “Ah! vraiment, Monsieur! c'est un bien brave homme, Monsieur St. Jean Angely.” “Angely!” said Mrs. Reynolds, as if recalling some faded recollection, “Angely—I think I have heard that name before.” “It may be. The gentleman I speak of resided some time in this country.” “But it can't be the same,” replied Mrs. Reynolds; “for the person I speak of lived over in Livingston's manner; and kind to strangers he could not be, for he deserted his own flesh and blood, and went off early in the war.” “It may be the same for all that, and must be. As to his deserting his children, `thereby hangs a tale;' but it is a long one.” “Well, sir, if you have anything to say in his favour, I am bold to say I think you ought to speak it; especially as the gentleman seems to have stood your friend in a cloudy day. The story certainly went sadly against him here.” “I have not the slightest objection, ma'am, to telling the story, if you have the patience to hear it; especially as I see I must wait till Jaubert has finished two more of your nice fresh eggs—`eggs of an hour,' Mrs. Reynolds.” “We always calculate to have fresh eggs, sir. But what was you going to say of Mr. Angely;” she added, betraying, in the tremulous tones of her voice, some emotion more heart stirring than curiosity. Jaubert turned a glance of inquiry on her that was answered by a sudden rush of blood to her cheeks; but the narrator proceeded without noticing anything extraordinary. “It was my good, or ill luck,” he said,— “and it is only in the long run we can tell whether luck be good or ill—but it was my luck to be ship-wrecked on the coast of Normandy, and good luck it certainly was, Jaubert, in my distress, to make such a port as the Chateau de Creve-Cœur—the castle, or, as we should call it here, Mrs. Reynolds, the estate of the Angely's. A fine family they are. You may think what a pleasure it was to me to find a gentleman acquainted with my country, and speaking my language as did Mr. St. Jean Angely. He was kind and affable to me, and always doing something for my pleasure, but I could see he had a heaviness at his heart—that he was often talking of one thing and thinking of another—nothing like so gay as the old gentleman, his father; who was like a fall flower—one of your marigolds, Mrs. Reynolds, spreading itself open to every ray of sunshine, as if there were no frosts and winter and death at hand. I felt a pity for the young man. With every thing that heart could desire, and without a heart to enjoy, he seemed to me like a sick man seated at a feast of which he could not Y taste. The day before I was to have come away, he took me aside, and, after saying that I had won his entire confidence, he disclosed to me the following particulars:— “He entered the French army early in life, and while yet a hotblooded, inconsiderate youth, he killed a brother officer in a duel, and was obliged to fly his country. He took refuge in Lisbon. Judgment, I may say mercy, too—in the dealings of Providence, Mrs. Reynolds, one is always close on the track of the other—followed him thither. Mr. Angely found employment in a mercantile house, and was standing writing at his desk at the moment of the terrible earthquake that laid Lisbon in ruins. The timbers of the house in which he was, were pitched in such a manner as to form a sort of arch over his head, on which the falling roof was sustained, and thus he was as it were, miraculously delivered from danger. From Lisbon he came to this country. `Mechanics,' says a Spanish proverb, `make the best pilgrims,' but, I am sure, not better than Frenchmen; for cast them where you will, they will get an honest living. Mr. Angely came up into Livingston's Manor, and there he took a fancy to a pretty Yankee girl, the only child of a widow, and married her. He earned a subsistence for his family by surveying. The country was new, and skilful surveyors scarce. After a few years his wife died and left him three children.” “Three!” repeated Mrs. Reynolds, involuntarily sighing. “Yes, poor things! there were three of them; too many to be left in these hard times, fatherless and motherless.” “Ah sir! and what must we think of the father that could forsake his little children at such a time?” “Think no evil, my friend; for Mr. Angely did not deserve it. He was employed by Mrs. Livingston, early in the war, to go down the river to survey some land near New York. There he was taken by the British as a spy, and, in spite of his remonstrances, sent to England. This was before the French had taken part with us, and he obtained leave to go to France, on giving his parole that he would not return to America. He received a parent's welcome, and the affair of the duel being nearly forgotten, a pardon was obtained for him without difficulty. If he could have forgotten his children, he would have been as happy as man could be; but his anxiety for them preyed on his health and spirits; and when I arrived at the chateau, his friends imagined he was sinking under some unknown disease. He had not communicated to his father the fact of his marriage and the existence of his children when I arrived there. The old gentleman, kind hearted and reasonable in the main, has all the prejudices of the nobility in the old countries about birth, and his son was afraid to confess that he had smuggled an ignoble little Yankee into the ancient family of the Greve-Cœurs. So good an opportunity as I afforded of communicating with his children, could not be passed by, and he at length summoned courage to tell the truth to his father. At first he was wroth enough, and stormed and vapoured; but after a little while his kind nature got the mastery of the blood of the Creve-Cœurs, and he consented to the children being sent for—the boys at least.” “Only the boys!” exclaimed Mrs. Reynolds, feeling relieved from an insupportable weight. “Only the boys. But the old gentleman might have as well saved all his credit and sent for the girl too; but that was not his pleasure. Well, Monsieur Jaubert here, a relative and particular friend of the family, came out with me to take charge of the children. We found the boys without much difficulty; two noble little fellows that a king might be proud of. After waiting for some time for Monsieur Angely's return, the overseers of the poor, believing he had abandoned his children bound them out. The little girl had been removed to some distance from her brothers. We found the place where she had been, but not the family. The husband and wife had quarrelled, and separated, and disappeared; and all the information we could obtain, was a vague story that such a child had lived there and had run away; and as nobody in these troublesome times can do more than look after their own children, this poor thing was left to her fate. Hopeless as it appears, Jaubert is not willing to give up our search. He fancies every brunette he sees is the lost Marie, and only last evening he would have persuaded me, that your black eyed little girl might be this stray scion of the Creve-Cœurs.” Mrs. Reynolds rose and left the room, and did not return till she was sufficiently composed to ask, in an assured voice, “What was their object in looking for the girl, if the father did not mean to reclaim her?” “He did mean to reclaim and provide for her,” replied the traveller, “and for that purpose I have ample funds in my hands. He only conceded to the old gentleman her remaining in the country for the present.” “Had you any direction as to how you were to dispose of her?” “Yes, positive orders to convey her to Boston, and place her under the guardianship of a French lady who resides there, a friend of Mr. Angely—one Madame Adelon.” “But could you find no trace of the child?” “Not the slightest.” “And you have determined to make no farther inquiry?” “Why should we? Inquiry is useless, and would but delay, to a tempestuous season, Jaubert's return with the boys.” Our readers are doubtless sufficiently aware, that the adopted child of our good landlady was the missing child of Monsieur Angely. A few words will be necessary to explain how she became possessed of her. Mrs. Reynolds and her husband were, two years prior to this period, approaching the close of a winter day's ride. Their sleigh was gliding noiselessly through a dry, new fallen snow, when their attention was arrested by the moanings of a child. To stop the horses and search for the sufferer from whom the sounds proceeded, was the instinctive impulse of benevolence. They had not gone many yards from the road, when, nestled close to a rock, and in some measure defended from the cold by a clump of laurels, they found a little girl, her hands and feet frozen, and nearly insensible. They immediately carried her to the sleigh, and put their horses to their utmost speed; but, as they were none of the fleetest, and the nearest habitation was at several miles distance, a considerable time elapsed before they could obtain the means of restoration, and in consequence of this delay, and of severe previous suffering, it was many weeks before the child recovered. In the mean time, though Mrs. Reynolds's residence was not more than thirty miles from the place where she had found the child, no inquiry was made for her. The account she gave of herself sufficiently explained this neglect. She said she had no mother; that her father had left home just after the snows melted and the birds came back; that he had left her and her two brothers, Jean and Avenel, with a woman to take care of them; that when this woman had waited a great while for their father, she grew tired and was cross to them, and then she too went away and left them quite alone. Then she said they had nothing to eat, and she supposed they were the poor, for the men they called the overseers of the poor took her and her brothers, and separated them, and she was carried a great way off to a woman who was very cross to her, and cross to her own children, and her Y 2 husband was cross too. One night he came home in a great passion, and he began to whip his wife with his big whip, and his wife beat him with the hot shovel, and she, the child, was scared, ran out of the house, and far up into a wood, to get beyond their cries; and when she would have returned, the snow was falling, and she could not find the path, and she had wandered about till she was so cold and tired she could go no further. Her name, she said, was Angely, and she believed her father was called a Frenchman. The only parental relic she possessed confirmed this statement. It was a locket she wore suspended at her neck. It contained a lock of hair; an armorial crest was engraven on the back, and under it was inscribed, “St. Jean Angely de Creve-Cœur.” This simple story established the conviction, that had been gaining strength in Mrs. Reynolds's mind, with every day's attendance on the interesting child, that they had been brought together by the special providence of God; and most faithfully did she discharge the maternal duties that she believed had been thus miraculously imposed on her. The little girl was on her part happy and delighted, and though she sometimes bitterly lamented her father and brothers, yet, as the impressions of childhood are slight, the recollection of them was almost effaced when the mysterious energies of memory were awakened by the sound of a language that seemed to have been utterly forgotten. These events occurred during the revolutionary war, a period of disaster and distress, when a very diligent search for a friendless child was not likely to be made, and as no inquiry ever reached Mrs. Reynolds's ear, and as she deemed the foundling an orphan, she had not hesitated to appropriate her. Her name was changed from Marie Angely to Mary Reynolds; and the good woman seemed as secure and happy as any mother, save when she was reminded of the imperfection of her title by the too curious inquiries of travellers. On these occasions, she was apt to betray a little irritability, and to veil the truth with a slight evasion, as in the instance which excited the suspicion of our sagacious Frenchman. Her condition was now a pitiable one. She had the tenderness, but not the rights of a parent. She was habitually pure and upright; but now she was strongly swayed by her affections. She would have persuaded herself, that the abandonment in which she first found the child, invested her with a paramount claim; but the stranger's story had proved that her father had not voluntarily abandoned her. Then she thought, “It cannot be for Mary's interest, that I should give her up;” and her mind took a rapid survey of the growing property of which the child was the heir apparent. But she would ask herself, “What do I know of the fortune of her father?” “But surely he cannot, he cannot love her as I do.” “Ah I do not know the feeling of a real parent;” and a burst of tears expressed the sadness of this conviction, and obliged her abruptly to withdraw from the presence of her guests, and leave them amazed at her sudden and violent emotion, while she retired to her own apartment, to implore guidance and support from Heaven. Those who honestly ask for light to point out a way which they would fain not see, and for power to endure a burden from which their nature shrinks, are often themselves astonished at the illumination vouchsafed, and the strength imparted. This was the experience of Mrs. Reynolds. She rose from her devotions with the conviction, that but one course remained to her, and with a degree of tranquillity hastened to Mary's bed-room. The child was just risen and dressed. Without any explanation to her—she was at the moment incapable of making any—she tied her locket, her sole credential, around her neck, led her down stairs, and placing her hand in Jaubert's, she said, “You have found the child!” and then retreated to hide the emotion she could not subdue. It was fortunate for her, that she was not compelled to witness the gay demonstrations of Jaubert's ecstasies, the graver, but not more equivocal manifestations of his companion's satisfaction, and the amazement and curiosity of the little girl, who was listening to the explanation of the strangers, with childlike animation, without adverting to her approaching separation from her who had given her the affection and cares of a parent. But when she came to be severed from this kind friend, she made amends for her thoughtlessness. She clung to her as if nature had knit the bonds that united them; and, amid her cries and sobs, she promised always to remember and love her as a mother. Many have made such promises. Marie Angely kept them. Ten years subsequent to the events above narrated, a letter, of which the following is a translation, was addressed by a foreigner in a high official station in this country, to his friend. “Dear Berville— “It is, I believe, or should be, a maxim of the true church, that confession of a sin is the first step towards its expiation. “Let me, then, invest you with a priest's cassock, and relieve my conscience by the relation of an odd episode in my history. When I parted from you, I was going with my friend, Robert Ellison, to visit his father, who has a beautiful place on the banks of the Hudson. Young Ellison, as you know, is a thorough republican, and does not conceal his contempt for those of his compatriots, who, professing the same principles, are really aristocrats in their prejudices and manners; who, having parted, and as they pretend voluntarily, with the substance, still grasp at the shadow. To test these false pretensions, and to mortify an absurd pride, he joyfully acquiesced in a proposition I made to him, to lay aside the pomp and circumstance of my official character, and to be presented to his friends without any of the accidental advantages with which fortune has invested me. You will inquire my motive, for you will not suspect me of the absurdity of crusading against the follies of society, the most hopeless of all crusades. No, as our own Moliere says, C'est une folie, à nulle autre seconde, De vouloir se méler de corriger le monde. My motives were then, in the first place, a love of ease, of dishabille; an impatience of the irksomeness of having the dignity of a nation to sustain; and, in the second place, I wished to ascertain how much of the favour lavished on me I should place to the account of the ambassador, and how much I might reserve to my own proper self. “You may call this latent vanity. I will not quarrel with you. I will not pretend that I was moved solely by a love of truth, by a pure desire to find out the realities of things; but alas! my dear Berville, if we were to abstract from the web of our motives, every thread tinged with self, would not warp and woof too disappear? Let, then, my motive be what it might, you will allow the experiment required courage. “We had some difficulty in settling the precise point at which to gage my pretensions. `Do not claim a drop of noble blood,' said my friend, `it would defeat your purpose.' There is something cabalistic in that word `noble.' The young ladjes at — would at once invest you with the attributes of romance; and the old dowagers would persecute you with histories of their titled ancestors, and anecdotes of lords and ladies that figured in the drawing-rooms of the colony. Neither must you be a plain gentleman of fortune, though that may seem to you a sufficient descent from your high station; but fortune has everywhere her shrines and her devotees. You must be the artificer of your own fortune, a talented young man who has no rank or fortune to be spoken of. What say you to the profession of a painter, a portrait painter, since that is the only branch of the art that gets a man bread in this country.' I acceded without shrinking, secretly flattering myself that my friend either underrated my intrinsic merit, or did the world rank injustice. “When we arrived we found a large party of the neighbouring gentry assembled to dine at —. I was received with great courtesy by the elder Ellison, and with kindness by Madame, on the ground, simply, of being an acquaintance of their son's. My friend took care to prevent any elation from my reception by saying to me in a low voice, `My father, God bless him, has good sense, good feeling, and experience, and he well knows that the value of gold does not depend on the circulation it has obtained;' and truly if he had known that I bore the impress of the king's countenance he could not have received me more graciously. There might have been more formality in his reception of the public functionary, but there could not have been more genuine hospitality. He presented me to his guests, and here I was first reminded of my disguise. Instead of the sensation I have been accustomed to see manifested in the lighting up of the face, in the deferential bow, or the blush of modesty, no emotion was visible. No eye rested on me, not a link of conversation was broken, and I was suffered, after rather an awkward passage through the ceremony, to retire to my seat, where I remained, observing, but not observed, till dinner was announced. From the habit of precedence, I was advancing to lead Madame to the dining-room, when I encountered my friend's glance, and shrunk back in time to avoid what must have appeared an unpardonable impertinence. I now fell into my modest station in the rear, and offered my arm to an awkward, bashful girl, who I am sure had two left hands by the manner in which she received my courtesy, and who did not honour me so far as to look up to see who it was that had saved her from the mortifying dilemma of leaving the drawingroom alone. I helped my companion from the dish nearest to me, and waited myself till Madame, reminded by her son of her oversight, sent me a plate of soup. I was swallowing this, unmolested by any conversation addressed to me, when my friend's father said to him, `When have you seen the French ambassador, Robert? I hoped you would have persuaded him to pay us a visit.' “`Perhaps he may,' replied my friend, `before the summer is over. He is at present out of the city on some excursion.' “`A prodigious favourite is your son with the French ambassador, as I hear from all quarters,' said a gentleman who sat next to Mr. Ellison. “`Ah! is that so, Robert? Are you intimate with Monsieur —?' “`He does me the honour to permit my society, sir.' Every mouth was now opened in praise of the ambassador. None of the company had seen him, but all had heard of his abilities, the charms of his conversation, his urbanity, his savoir plaire. `You must be proud of your countryman, M. Dufau?' (this was my assumed name) said my host, with that courtesy that finds a word for the humblest guest. “I said it was certainly gratifying to my national feeling to find him approved in America, but that, perhaps it was not his merit alone that obtained him such distinguished favour; that I had understood he was a great admirer of this country, and though I should do him injustice to say `he praised, only to be praised,' yet I believed there was always a pretty accurately measured exchange in this traffic. “`The gentleman is right,' said an old Englishman who sat opposite to me, and who had not before vouchsafed to manifest a consciousness of my existence; `this is all French palaver in Monsieur —. He cannot be such a warm admirer of this country. The man knows better; he has been in England.' “I was too well acquainted with English manners to be startled by any manifestation of that conviction which an Englishman demonstrates in every part of the world, that his nation has no equal; but I instinctively defended my countryman, and eager for an opportunity to test the colloquial powers so much admired in the ambassador, I entered the lists with my English opponent, and thus stimulated, I was certainly far more eloquent than I ever had been before, on the history, the present condition, and the prospects of this country. But alas for the vanity of M. Dufau! my host, it is true, gave me all the attention he could spare from the courtesies of the table, but save his ear, I gained none but that half-accorded by my contemptuous, testy, and impatient antagonist, who after barking out a few sentences at me, relapsed into a moody silence. “I next addressed some trifling gallantries to my bashful neighbour, fancying that she who was neglected by everybody else, would know how to appreciate my attentions; but her eyes were rivetted to a fashionable beauty at the upper extremity of the table, and a half a dozen `no sirs' and `yes sirs,' misplaced, were all the return I could obtain from her. To remain silent and passive, you know, to me, was impossible; so I next made an essay on a vinegar faced dame on my left, far in the wane of life. `If my civilities have been lead elsewhere, in this market,' thought I, `they will at least prove silver or gold.' But here I received my cruellest rebuff; for the lady, after apparently listening to me, said, `I do not understand you.' I raised my voice, but she, determining to shelter the infirmity of age at my expense, replied, `I am not so deaf, sir, but really you speak such broken English, that I cannot understand you.' This was too much, and I might have betrayed my vexation, if an intelligent and laughing glance from my friend had not restored my good humour, and a second reflection, suggesting that it was far more important to the old woman's happiness that her vanity should remain unimpaired, than it could be to me to have mine reduced, even to fragments, I humbly begged her pardon, and relapsed into a contented silence, solacing myself with the thought, that our encounter was but an illustration of that of the china and earthen jars. But I will not weary you with detailing all the trials of my philosophy, but only confess that the negligence of the servants was not the least of them—the grinning self-complacency with which these apes of their superiors signified to me that my wants might be deferred. “After all, my humble position would not have been so disagreeable, if I had been accustomed to it. The world's admiration, like all other luxuries, in the end becomes necessary, and then, too, like other luxuries, ceases to be enjoyed, or even felt, till it is withdrawn and leaves an aching void. If this is Irish, set it down to my broken English. After dinner, I followed the ladies to the drawing-room, and was presented by my friend to Miss —, a reigning beauty. She received me with one of those gracious smiles, that a hacknied belle always bestows on a new worshipper at her shrine. These popular favourites, be it clergyman, politician, or beauty, are as covetous of the flatteries they receive, as a miser is of gold. No matter how unclean the vessel from which the incense rises; no matter what Z base alloy, may mingle with the precious metal. Have you ever encountered one of these spoiled favourites in the thronged street, and tried to arrest the attention for a moment; to fix the eye that was roving for every tributary glance? If you have, you will understand without my describing it, the distrait manner with which the belle received my first compliments. Even this was not long accorded me, for a better accredited and more zealous admirer than myself appearing, she left me to my meditations, which were not rendered the more agreeable by my overhearing an old lady say, in a voice, which, though slightly depressed, she evidently made no effort to subdue to an inaudible key, `I wonder what possessed Robert Ellison to bring that French portrait painter here! How the world has changed since the Revolution! There is no longer any house where you don't meet mixed society.' My friend had approached in time to overhear her as well as myself. `The ignorant old fool!' he exclaimed, `shall I tell her that artists are the nobility of every country?' “`No,' said I, `do not waste your rhetoric; there is no enlightening the ignorance of stupidity; a black substance will not reflect even the sun's rays.' “Ellison then proposed that I should join a party at whist; but I complained of the heated air of the drawing-room, and, availing myself of my insignificance, I followed the bent of my inclinations, a privilege the humble should not undervalue, and sauntered abroad. The evening was beautiful enough to have soothed a misanthrope, or warmed the heart of a stoic. Its peace, its salutary, sacred voice restored me to myself, and I was ashamed that my tranquillity had been disturbed. I contemned the folly of the artificial distinctions of life, and felt quite indifferent to them—when alone. “The ground in front of my friend's house slopes to the Hudson, and is still embellished with trees of the majestic native growth. Where nature has left anything to be supplied by art, walks have been arranged and planted; but carefully, so as not to impede the view of the river, which was now in perfect repose. A sloop lay in the channel, its sails all furled, idly floating on the slumbering surface. While I was wishing my friend were with me, for I am too much of a Frenchman to relish fully even nature, the favourite companion of sentimentalists, in solitude, I saw a boat put off from the little vessel, and row slowly towards the shore. Presently a sweet female voice swelled on the stillness of the night, accompanied by the notes of a guitar, struck by a practised hand. Could any young man's mercury resist moonlight and such music? Mine could not, and I very soon left behind me all of terra firma that intervened between me and the siren, and ensconced myself in a deeply shaded nook at the very water's edge, where I could see and hear without being observed. The boat approached the spot where I stood, and was moored at half a dozen yards from my feet; but as my figure was in shadow, and sheltered by a thick copse of hazel bushes, I was perfectly concealed, while, by a flood of moonbeams, that poured on my unsuspicious neighbours, I saw them as plainly as if it were daylight. These were two men, whom I soon ascertained to be the captain of the sloop and an attendant, and that they were going to a farm house in the neighbourhood for eggs, milk, &amp;c. The two females were to remain in the boat till their return. The lady of the guitar was inclined to go with them as far as the oak wood on the brow of the hill; but the captain persuaded her to remain in the boat, by telling her there was a formidable dog on the place, which she might encounter. As soon as the captain was gone, her companion, an elderly, staid looking country woman, said to her, `Now, child, as I came here for your pleasure, you must sing for mine. None of your new-fangled fancies, but good Old Robin Grey.' “`Oh, Robin Grey is a doleful ditty; but anything to reward you for indulging me in coming on shore.' “She then sung that touching ballad. The English, certainly the Scotch, excel us as much in the pathos of unembellished nature and truth, as we do them in all literary refinement, ingenuity, and grace. I know not how much of the tribute that gushed from my heart was paid to the poetry and music, and how much to the beautiful organ by which they were expressed, for the fair musician looked herself like one of the bright creations of poetry. I would describe her, but description is cold and quite inadequate to convey an idea of her, and of the scene with which she harmonized. It was one of nature's sweetest accords; the balmy air, the cloudless sky, the river, reflecting like a spotless mirror the blue arch, the moon and her bright train; my enchantress, the embodied spirit of the evening, and her music the voice of nature. I might have forgotten that I was in human mould, but I had one effectual curb to my imagination; one mortal annoyance. Argus, confound him! had followed me from the house, and it was only by dint of continued coaxing and caressing that I could keep him quiet. Before the ballad was finished, however, he was soothed by its monotonous sadness, and crouching at my feet, he fell asleep, I believe. I forgot him. Suddenly `the dainty spirit' changed from the low breathings of melancholy to a gay French air—the very air, Berville, that Claudine, in her mirthful moments, used to sing to us. The transition was so abrupt that it seemed as if the wing of joy had swept over the strings of her instrument. I started forth from my concealment. That was not all. Argus sprang out, too, and barking furiously, bounded towards the boat. The old woman screamed, `There is the dog!' and the young lady, not less terrified, dropped her guitar, and unhooking the boat, she seized an oar and pushed it off without listening to my apologies and assurances. In her agitation she dropped the oar, and her companion, still more tremulous than herself, in her attempt to regain it, lost the other, which she had instinctively grasped. As soon as the first impulse imparted to the boat was expended, it scarcely moved at all, and I had leisure to explain my sudden appearance, and to say that my dog, far from being the formidable animal they imagined, was a harmless spaniel, who should immediately make all the amends in his power for the terror he had caused. I then directed him to the floating oars. He plunged into the water and brought them to me, but he either did not, or would not understand my wish that he should convey them to the boat, which, though very slowly, was evidently receding from the shore. I then without farther hesitation, threw off my coat, swam to the boat, and receiving there the oars from Argus's mouth, I soon reconducted the boat to its haven. There was something enchanting to me in the frankness with which my fair musician expressed her pleasure at the homage I had involuntarily paid to her art, and the grace with which she received the slight service I rendered her. Perhaps I felt it the more for the mortifying experience of the day. I do not care very nicely to analyze my feelings, nor to ascertain how much there was of restored self complacency in the delicious excitement of that hour.” “The elderly lady, for lady she must needs be since my fair incognita called her mother, expressed a matronly solicitude about the effect of my wet garments, but I assured her that I apprehended no inconvenience from them, and I begged to be allowed to remain at my station till the return of their attendants. The circumstances of our introduction had been such as to dissipate all ceremony. Indeed this characteristic of English manners would have as ill fitted the trustful, ingenuous, and gay disposition of my new acquaintance, as a coat of mail her light, graceful person. Z 2 She sung at my request, our popular opera airs, with more effect, because with far more feeling, than our best professed artists. She talked of music, and of the poetry of nature, with genius and taste; and she listened with that eager and pleased attention, which is the second best gift of conversation. I should have taken no note of the passage of time but for the fidgetting of the old lady, who often interrupted us with expressions of her concern at the captain's delay, for which he, quite too soon, appeared to render an account himself. As I was compelled to take my leave, I asked my fair unknown if I might not be allowed to think of her by some more accurate designation than the `Lady of the Guitar.' “`My name is'—she replied promptly, and then, after a moment's hesitation, added, `No—pardon me, your romantic designation better suits the adventure of the night.' I was vexed at my disappointment, but she chased away the shade of displeasure by the graceful playfulness with which she kissed her hand to me as the boat pushed off. I lingered on the shore till she had reached the vessel, and then slowly retraced my steps towards the house. I was startled by meeting my friend, for my mind was so absorbed that I had not heard his approaching footstep `Ah!' he exclaimed, `is this your philosophy? turned misanthrope at the first frown from the world.' “`My philosophy,' I replied, `has neither been vanquished, nor has it conquered, for I had forgotten all its trials.' “My friend evidently believed, notwithstanding my disclaimer, that my vanity required some indemnity for the humiliations it had sustained, and he repeated to me some assuaging compliments from his father. `But,' he concluded, `tell me, have you really turned sentimentalist, and been holding high converse with the stars?' “`With a most brilliant star,' I replied, and related my adventure. “Ellison's curiosity was excited, and he proposed we should take our flutes, go out in the barge, and serenade the `Lady of the Guitar.' I, of course, assented, and the next half hour found us floating around the little vessel like humble satellites. We played an accompaniment and sung alternately, he in English, and I in French; but there was no token given that the offered incense was accepted; no salutation, save a coarse one from the captain, who invited us to go `on board and take some grog.' We of course declined his professional courtesy. `Then, for the Lord's sake, lads,' he said, `stop your piping, and give us a good berth. Sleep, at this time o'night, is better music than the jolliest tune that ever was played.' “Thus dismissed, and discomfited by the lady's neglect, we resumed our oars and were preparing to return to the shore, when the cabin window was gently raised, and our fair incognita sung a sweet little French air, beginning `Adieu, adieu!' We remained, sound, motion, almost breath suspended till the song was finished.” “So sweetly she bids us adieu, I think that she bids us return,” said my friend, and we instantly rowed our boat towards the stern of the vessel. At this moment the sash was suddenly dropped, and taking this for a definitive `Good night,' we retired. “Now, dear Berville, I have faithfully related the adventures of my masquerade—my boyish pastime, you may call it. Be it so. This day has been worth a year of care and dignity. I shall return to New York in a few days. Till then farewell. Yours, Constant.” But though M. Constant professed himself satisfied with his day, there was a lurking disquietude at his heart. He had written to assure himself there was nothing there he dare not express, and yet he had concluded without once alluding to the cause of his self-reproach. He had folded the letter, but he opened it, and added;— “P. S. I did not describe to you my friend's vexation that the responded song was in French. `Ah!' said he, `I see there is no chance for such poor devils as I, so long as you are neither married nor betrothed.”' He again closed the letter, and was for a moment satisfied that there could be nothing in the nature of that which he had so frankly communicated that required concealment. He walked to the window and eyed the little vessel as a miser looks at the casket that contains his treasure; then starting from his reverie, he took from his bosom a miniature, and contemplated it steadfastly for a few moments; “It is my conscience that reproaches me,” he said, “and not this serene, benign countenance. O Emma! thou art equally incapable of inflicting and resenting wrong, and shall thy trust and gentleness be returned by even a transient treachery? Am I so sure of faithfully keeping the citadel that I may parley with an enemy?” The result of this self-examination was a determination to burn the letter, and to dismiss for ever from his mind the enchantress whose power had so swayed him from his loyalty. But though he turned from the window, resolutely closed the blind, and excluded the moonlight, which he fancied influenced his imagination as if he were a lunatic; though he went to bed and sunk into oblivious sleep, the spirit was not laid. Imagination revelled in its triumph over the will. He was in France, in beautiful France—more beautiful now than in the visions of memory and affection. He was at his remembered haunts in his father's grounds; the “Lady of the Guitar” was with him; she sang his favourite songs; he saw her sparkling glance, her glowing cheek, her rich, dark tints, “The embrowning of the fruit that tells How rich within, the soul of sweetness dwells;” he heard the innocent childlike laugh, that, — “without any control, Save the sweet one of gracefulness rung from her soul.” Then there was interposed between him and this embodied spirit of his joyous clime a slowly moving figure; a cold, fair, pensive countenance, that had more of sorrow than resentment, but, still, though its reproach was gentle, it was the reproach of the stern spectre of conscience. He cast down his eyes, and they fell on the word “BETROTHED,” traced in the sand at his feet. The “Lady of the Guitar” was gaily advancing towards him. Another step and her flowing mantle would have swept over the word, and effaced it forever. He raised his hand to deprecate her approach, and awoke; and while the visions of sleep still confusedly mingled with the recollections and resolutions of the preceding day, he was up and at the window; had thrown open the blind and ascertained that the vessel still lay becalmed in the stream. That virtue is certainly to be envied, that does not need to be shielded and fortified by opportunity and circumstance. If the vessel had disappeared, the recollections of the evening might have been as evanescent and ineffectual as the dreams of the night; but there it was, in fine relief, and as motionless as if it were encased in the blue waters. In spite of M. Constant's excellent resolutions, he lingered at the window, and returned there as if he were spellbound. Strange power that could rivet his eyes to an ill shapen little Dutch skipper! But that body did contain a spirit, and that spirit, seemingly as perturbed as his own, soon appeared, moving with a light step to and fro on the deck. The apartment M. Constant occupied, was furnished, among other luxuries, with a fine spyglass. To resist using this facility for closer communion was impossible; and by its aid he could perceive every motion of the “lady of his thoughts,” almost the changes of her countenance. He saw she was gazing on the shore, and that she turned eagerly to her companion to point her attention to some object that had caught her eye, and at the same moment he perceived it was his friend, who was strolling on the shore. Ellison saw him too, and waved his handkerchief in salutation. M. Constant returned the greeting, threw down the glass, and withdrew from the window with a feeling of compunction at his indulgence, as if he had again heard that word betrothed spoken. Why is it that external agents have so much influence over the mysterious operations of conscience? Why is it that its energy so often sleeps while there is no witness to the wrong we commit? “Keep thy heart, for out of it are the issues of life.” After breakfast, Ellison said to M. Constant, “I am afraid you find your masquerade dull. Let us beguile the morning by a visit to your `Lady of the Guitar.' There is nothing lends such wings to time as a pretty girl. Our guests are a dull concern.” “A dull concern, when there is a beauty and a fortune among them!” “Yes, a sated belle is to me as disagreeable as a pampered child; as my grandmother's little pet Rosy, whom I saw the other day, tossing away her sugar plums, and crying `'Tis not sweet enough;' and as to fortune, though I am neither a philosopher nor a sentimentalist, I shall never take the temple of Hymen in my way to wealth; for of all speculations, a matrimonial speculation seems to me the most hazardous, and the most disgraceful. But we loiter. Will you pay your devoirs to our unknown?” “I believe not; I have letters to write this morning.” “To Emma? Pardon me—I do not mean to pry into your cabinet, but if the letters are to her they may be deferred. She is a dear good soul, and will find twenty apologies for every fault you commit.” “If they are to her, such generosity should not be abused. No, I will not go. But on what pretext will you?” “Pretext indeed! does a pilgrim seek for a pretext to visit my Lady of Loretto, or the shrine of any other saint? Here comes the gardener with a basket of fine fruit which I have ordered to be prepared, and of which I shall be the bearer to the sufferers pent in that dirty sloop this breathless August morning—from mere philanthropy you know. Commend me to Emma,” he added gaily; “I will bear witness for you that your enthusiasm for this unknown was a mere coup de la lune, and that when daylight appeared you were as loyal, and—as dull as a married man.” Ellison's raillery did not render the bitter pill of self-denial more palatable to M. Constant. He turned away without reply, but instead of returning to his apartment he obtained a gun, and inquiring the best direction to pursue in quest of game, he sauntered into a wooded defile that wound among the hills, and was so enclosed by them as not to afford even a glimpse of the river. Here he threw himself on the grass, took a blank leaf from his pocket-book, and began a sonnet to Constancy, but broke off in the middle; scribbled half a dozen odd lines from the different songs that had entranced him on the preceding evening; sketched a guitar, then rose, and, still musing, pursued his way up the defile. The path he had taken led him around the base of an eminence to a rivulet that came frolieking down a hill, now leaping, and now loitering with the capricious humour of childhood. He traced it to its source, a clear fountain bubbling up from the earth at the foot of a high, precipitous rock. Clusters of purple and pink wild flowers hung from the clefts of the rock, wreathing its bare old front, and presenting a beautiful harmony in contrast, like infancy and old age. The rock and the sides of the fountain formed a little amphitheatre, enclosed and deeply shaded by the mountain ash, the aromatic hemlock and the lofty basswood. This sequestered retreat, with its fresh aspect and sweet exhalations, afforded a delicious refuge from the fierce heat and overpowering light of an August day. M. Constant was lingering to enjoy it when his ear caught the sound of distant and animated voices. He started, and for a moment thought himself cheated by the illusions of a distempered fancy; but, as the sounds approached nearer, he was assured of their reality, and they affected him like the most painful discord, though they were produced by the sweet, clear, penetrating voice of the unknown, and the hitherto welcome tones of his friend. The impropriety of a young girl straying off into such a solitude with an acquaintance of an hour was obvious, but was perhaps more shocking to M. Constant than it would have been to a perfectly disinterested observer. It gave a dreadful jar to his preconceived notions, and contrasted, rudely enough, with the conduct of the preceding night, when the lady had, with such scrupulous delicacy, forborne to show herself on the deck of the sloop. As they drew nearer he thought there was something in the gay fimiliar tones of Ellison, disgusting; and the laugh of the lady, which before had seemed the sweetest music of a youthful and innocent spirit, was now harsh and hoydenish. The strain of their conversation, too, for they were near enough to be heard distinctly, while the windings of the path prevented his being seen, though it was graceful chitchat enough, appeared to him trifling and flippant in the extreme. As they came still nearer he listened more intently, for he had a personal interest in the subject. “And so, my `Lady of the Guitar,”' said Ellison, “you persist in preserving that scrap of paper, merely, I presume, as a specimen of the sister arts of design and poetry. You are sure those scratches are meant for a guitar, and not a jewsharp, and that the fragment is a sonnet and not a monody?” “Certainly it is a sonnet; the poet says so himself. See here—`Sonnet a la Constance.”' “Well, it is certainly in the strain of a `lament.' My friend was in a strait; what he would do he could not. Constancy is a very pretty theme for a boarding-school letter, but I am afraid the poor fellow will not find his inspiration in this tame virtue?” “Ah! these tame virtues, as you call them,” replied the lady, “are the salutary food of life, while your themes of inspiration are intoxicating draughts, violent and transient in their effects.” “A very sage lesson, and very well conned. Did your grandmother teach it to you?” “No matter—I have got it by heart.” “O those moral New Englanders, they change all the poetry of life to wise saws. Thank heaven you have escaped from them in time to retain some portion of your original mercurial nature. But now let me tell you, my sage young friend, that same paper may prove as dangerous where you are going as a match to a magazine. So let me advise you, either keep it quite to yourself, or give it to the winds.” “You talk riddles, Mr. Ellison; but I will not be quizzed into believing this little castaway scrap of paper can be of any import.” “Let me lable it for you then, if, as I see, it is to be filled among the precious stores of your pocket-book.” There was a short pause when the lady, as M. Constant supposed, looking over Ellison's superscription, A A read aloud, “Love's Labour Lost,” and then exclaimed, “Pshaw, Robert, how absurd!” and tore off the offensive lable, while he laughed at her vexation. M. Constant felt that it would be very embarrassing for him to be discovered as a passive listener to this conversation. He had been chained to the spot by an interest that he would gladly not have felt, but which he could not suppress. Another turn would bring them directly before him. To delay longer without being seen was therefore impossible. As he put aside the rustling branches, he heard Ellison exclaim, “Ha! there are some startled quails;” but before his friend could take a more accurate observation, he had sprung around an angle of the rock, and was beyond sight and hearing. The gentlemen met before dinner. M. Constant was walking on the piazza, apparently moody and little disposed to sympathize with Ellison's extravagant expressions of admiration of the unknown, or of regret that the fresh breeze was now wafting the vessel and its precious cargo far away. “In the name of Heaven, Constant,” he said, “what has so suddenly turned you to ice? Last night you seemed to think it necessary to invent—pardon me— allege some apology for your prompt sensibility, and you said it was not the beauty, the voice, the grace, or any of the obvious and sufficient charms of this young enchantress—that was your word—that fascinated you, but it was a resemblance to the glowing beauties of your own clime; and now, if you had been born at the north pole and she at the equator, you could not manifest less affinity.” “There are certain principles,” replied M. Constant, coldly, “that overcome natural affinities. I hope you have passed your morning agreeably.” “Agreeably? Delightfully! Our incognita is more beautiful than you described her.” “Is she then still incognita to you?” asked M. Constant with a penetrating glance. “Not exactly; she favoured me with her name.” “Her name! what is it?” “Pardon me, I am under a prohibition not to tell.” “The lady certainly makes marked distinctions. She is as reserved towards others as frank to you.” “She had her reasons.” “Doubtless; but what were they?” “Why, one was that I refused to tell her your name.” “And why did you that?” “I had my reasons, too.” M. Constant was vexed at the mystery his friend affected. He was annoyed, too, at his perfect self complacency and imperturbable good nature, and, more than all, ashamed of his own irritability. He made an effort to overcome it, and to put himself on a level with Ellison. He succeeded so far in his efforts as to continue to talk of the lady with apparent nonchalance till he was summoned to dinner; but though he tried every mode his ingenuity could devise, he could not draw from his friend the slightest allusion to the lady's extraordinary visit to the shore, or any particular of their interview, which explained the perfect familiarity that seemed to exist between them; and what made this mystery more inscrutable, was the tone of enthusiasm which Ellison maintained in speaking of the lady, and which no young man sincerely feels without a sentiment of respect. In spite of M. Constant's virtuous resolutions and efforts, the “Lady of the Guitar” continued to occupy his imagination, and he determined to take the surest measures to dispel an influence which he had in vain resisted. As he parted from his friend at night, he announced his intention of taking his departure the following morning. After expressing his sincere regret, Ellison said, “You go immediately to town?” “No; I go to Mr. Liston's.” “Ah! is it so?” “Even so, Ellison; but no more till we meet again. I have supported my masquerade with little spirit; but do not betray me, and we, neither of us, shall lose reputation.” M. Constant had for a long time been on terms of intimacy and friendship with Miss Liston. This lady belonged to one of the most distinguished families in our country. She was agreeable in her person, had a fund of good sense, was well informed and perfectly amiable. Such characters are admirable in the conduct of life, if not exciting to the imagination; that precious faculty, which, like the element of fire, the most powerful and dangerous agent, may warm, or may consume us. Long and intimate friendship between unfettered persons of different sexes is very likely to terminate, as that of M. Constant and Miss Liston terminated, in an engagement. He had a sentiment of deep and fixed affection for her, which, probably, no influence could have materially affected; but when that being crossed his path who seemed to him to realize the brightest visions of his youth, he felt a secret consciousness that the fidelity of his affection was endangered. The little mystery in which the unknown was shrouded, the very circumstance of calling her the “unknown,” magnified the importance of the affair, as objects are enlarged, seen through a mist. He very wisely and prudently concluded that the surest way of dispelling all illusion, would be frankly to relate the particulars to Miss Liston, only reserving to himself certain feelings which would not be to her edification, and which he believed would be dispelled by participating their cause with her. Accordingly, at their first meeting he was meditating how he should get over the embarrassment of introducing the subject, when Miss Liston said, “I have a great pleasure in reserve for you,” and left him without any further explanation, and in a few moments returned, followed by a lady, and saying as she re-entered, “Marie Angely, you and Constant, my best friends, must not meet as strangers.” A half suppressed exclamation burst from the lips of both. All M. Constant's habitual grace forsook him. He overturned Miss Liston's workstand, workbox, and working paraphernalia, in advancing to make his bow. Miss Angely's naturally high colour was heightened to a painful excess; she made an effort to reciprocate the common courtesies of an introduction, but in vain; the words faltered on her lips, and after struggling a moment with opposing feelings, the truth and simplicity of her heart triumphed, and turning to Miss Liston, she said, “Your friend, Emma, is the gentleman I met on the river.” Miss Liston had been the confidant of all her romantic young friend's impressions from her moonlight interview with the stranger, and it was now her turn to suffer a full share of the embarrassment of the other parties. She looked to M. Constant for an explanation. Never had he, in the whole course of his diplomatic career, been more puzzled; but after a moment's hesitation he followed Miss Angely in the safe path of ingenuousness, and truly told all the particulars of his late adventures, concluding with a good humoured censure of his friend Ellison, who had long and intimately known Miss Angely, and who, to gratify his mischief-loving temper, had contrived the mystery which led to the rather awkward denouement. Thus these circumstances, which might have been woven into an intricate web of delicate embarrassment and romantic distress, that might have ended in the misery of one, perhaps of all parties, were diversted of their interest and their danger by being promptly and frankly disclosed. Miss Angely, whom our readers have already recognised as the little girl of the inn, had met with Miss A A 2 Liston at a boarding school in Boston, where, though Miss Liston was her elder by several years, they formed an enthusiastic, and, rare in the annals of boarding schools, an enduring friendship. Marie Angely had faithfully discharged the debt of gratitude to Mrs. Reynolds, and though acquiring, as may be supposed, somewhat of the fastidiousness that accompanies refined education and intercourse, no one could perceive any abatement of her respect or affection for her kind protectress, or the slightest diminution of her familiarity with her. She passed a part of every summer with her, always called her mother, and, by the fidelity of her kindness and the charm of her manner, she diffused light and warmth over the whole tract of Mrs. Reynolds's existence. She linked expectations, that might have been blasted, to a happy futurity, and cherished and elevated affections, which, but for her sunny influence, would have been left to wither and perish. Oh that the fortunate and happy could know how much they have in their gift! Miss Angely had been on one of her annual visits to her humble friend, and was on her way, accompanied by her, to New York, where she was to join Miss Liston, when the incidents occurred which we have related. There is nothing in the termination of our tale to indemnify the lover of romance for its previous dulness; but it is a true story, and its materials must be received from tradition, and not supplied by imagination. M. Constant was, in the course of a few weeks, united to Miss Liston. This lady had long cherished a hope that her friend would be a permanent member of her family, and she used every art of affection to persuade her to remain with her at least so long as she should decline the suits of all the lovers who were now thronging around her, attracted by her beauty, or loveliness, or the eclat she derived from her intimacy with the wife of the ambassador. M. Constant did not very warmly second his wife's entreaties. He perhaps had a poignant recollection of certan elective affinities, and his experience taught him the truth, if indeed he had not derived it from a higher source, that, in the present infirm condition of human virtue, it is always safest and best not voluntarily to “enter into temptation.” Miss Angely returned to Boston. M. Constant's union with Miss Liston was one of uninterrupted confidence and conjugal happiness; but it was not destined to be of long duration. His wife died in about a year after their marriage. Among her papers was found a letter addressed to her husband, written in expectation of the fatal issue of the event that had terminated her life, in which she earnestly recommended her friend as her successor. In due time her request was honoured. M. Constant married Miss Angely. After residing for some time in America, they went to France, where she was received as an ornament to her noble family, and acknowledged to be “the brightest jewel in its coronet.” Far from the mean pride of those who shrink from recurring to the humble stages in their progress to the heights of fortune, Madame Constant delighted in relating the vicissitudes of her life, and dwelt particularly on that period, when, as Mrs. Reynolds's handmaid, she considered herself honoured in standing behind the chair of the wife of the great General Knox. “The longest day comes to the vesper hour.” Madame Constant closed at Paris a life of virtue, prosperity, and happiness, in July 1827.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dear Berville— “It is, I believe, or should be, a maxim of the true church, that confession of a sin is the first step towards its expiation. “Let me, then, invest you with a priest's cassock, and relieve my conscience by the relation of an odd episode in my history. When I parted from you, I was going with my friend, Robert Ellison, to visit his father, who has a beautiful place on the banks of the Hudson. Young Ellison, as you know, is a thorough republican, and does not conceal his contempt for those of his compatriots, who, professing the same principles, are really aristocrats in their prejudices and manners; who, having parted, and as they pretend voluntarily, with the substance, still grasp at the shadow. To test these false pretensions, and to mortify an absurd pride, he joyfully acquiesced in a proposition I made to him, to lay aside the pomp and circumstance of my official character, and to be presented to his friends without any of the accidental advantages with which fortune has invested me. You will inquire my motive, for you will not suspect me of the absurdity of crusading against the follies of society, the most hopeless of all crusades. No, as our own Moliere says, C'est une folie, à nulle autre seconde, De vouloir se méler de corriger le monde. My motives were then, in the first place, a love of ease, of dishabille; an impatience of the irksomeness of having the dignity of a nation to sustain; and, in the second place, I wished to ascertain how much of the favour lavished on me I should place to the account of the ambassador, and how much I might reserve to my own proper self. “You may call this latent vanity. I will not quarrel with you. I will not pretend that I was moved solely by a love of truth, by a pure desire to find out the realities of things; but alas! my dear Berville, if we were to abstract from the web of our motives, every thread tinged with self, would not warp and woof too disappear? Let, then, my motive be what it might, you will allow the experiment required courage. “We had some difficulty in settling the precise point at which to gage my pretensions. `Do not claim a drop of noble blood,' said my friend, `it would defeat your purpose.' There is something cabalistic in that word `noble.' The young ladjes at — would at once invest you with the attributes of romance; and the old dowagers would persecute you with histories of their titled ancestors, and anecdotes of lords and ladies that figured in the drawing-rooms of the colony. Neither must you be a plain gentleman of fortune, though that may seem to you a sufficient descent from your high station; but fortune has everywhere her shrines and her devotees. You must be the artificer of your own fortune, a talented young man who has no rank or fortune to be spoken of. What say you to the profession of a painter, a portrait painter, since that is the only branch of the art that gets a man bread in this country.' I acceded without shrinking, secretly flattering myself that my friend either underrated my intrinsic merit, or did the world rank injustice. “When we arrived we found a large party of the neighbouring gentry assembled to dine at —. I was received with great courtesy by the elder Ellison, and with kindness by Madame, on the ground, simply, of being an acquaintance of their son's. My friend took care to prevent any elation from my reception by saying to me in a low voice, `My father, God bless him, has good sense, good feeling, and experience, and he well knows that the value of gold does not depend on the circulation it has obtained;' and truly if he had known that I bore the impress of the king's countenance he could not have received me more graciously. There might have been more formality in his reception of the public functionary, but there could not have been more genuine hospitality. He presented me to his guests, and here I was first reminded of my disguise. Instead of the sensation I have been accustomed to see manifested in the lighting up of the face, in the deferential bow, or the blush of modesty, no emotion was visible. No eye rested on me, not a link of conversation was broken, and I was suffered, after rather an awkward passage through the ceremony, to retire to my seat, where I remained, observing, but not observed, till dinner was announced. From the habit of precedence, I was advancing to lead Madame to the dining-room, when I encountered my friend's glance, and shrunk back in time to avoid what must have appeared an unpardonable impertinence. I now fell into my modest station in the rear, and offered my arm to an awkward, bashful girl, who I am sure had two left hands by the manner in which she received my courtesy, and who did not honour me so far as to look up to see who it was that had saved her from the mortifying dilemma of leaving the drawingroom alone. I helped my companion from the dish nearest to me, and waited myself till Madame, reminded by her son of her oversight, sent me a plate of soup. I was swallowing this, unmolested by any conversation addressed to me, when my friend's father said to him, `When have you seen the French ambassador, Robert? I hoped you would have persuaded him to pay us a visit.' “`Perhaps he may,' replied my friend, `before the summer is over. He is at present out of the city on some excursion.' “`A prodigious favourite is your son with the French ambassador, as I hear from all quarters,' said a gentleman who sat next to Mr. Ellison. “`Ah! is that so, Robert? Are you intimate with Monsieur —?' “`He does me the honour to permit my society, sir.' Every mouth was now opened in praise of the ambassador. None of the company had seen him, but all had heard of his abilities, the charms of his conversation, his urbanity, his savoir plaire. `You must be proud of your countryman, M. Dufau?' (this was my assumed name) said my host, with that courtesy that finds a word for the humblest guest. “I said it was certainly gratifying to my national feeling to find him approved in America, but that, perhaps it was not his merit alone that obtained him such distinguished favour; that I had understood he was a great admirer of this country, and though I should do him injustice to say `he praised, only to be praised,' yet I believed there was always a pretty accurately measured exchange in this traffic. “`The gentleman is right,' said an old Englishman who sat opposite to me, and who had not before vouchsafed to manifest a consciousness of my existence; `this is all French palaver in Monsieur —. He cannot be such a warm admirer of this country. The man knows better; he has been in England.' “I was too well acquainted with English manners to be startled by any manifestation of that conviction which an Englishman demonstrates in every part of the world, that his nation has no equal; but I instinctively defended my countryman, and eager for an opportunity to test the colloquial powers so much admired in the ambassador, I entered the lists with my English opponent, and thus stimulated, I was certainly far more eloquent than I ever had been before, on the history, the present condition, and the prospects of this country. But alas for the vanity of M. Dufau! my host, it is true, gave me all the attention he could spare from the courtesies of the table, but save his ear, I gained none but that half-accorded by my contemptuous, testy, and impatient antagonist, who after barking out a few sentences at me, relapsed into a moody silence. “I next addressed some trifling gallantries to my bashful neighbour, fancying that she who was neglected by everybody else, would know how to appreciate my attentions; but her eyes were rivetted to a fashionable beauty at the upper extremity of the table, and a half a dozen `no sirs' and `yes sirs,' misplaced, were all the return I could obtain from her. To remain silent and passive, you know, to me, was impossible; so I next made an essay on a vinegar faced dame on my left, far in the wane of life. `If my civilities have been lead elsewhere, in this market,' thought I, `they will at least prove silver or gold.' But here I received my cruellest rebuff; for the lady, after apparently listening to me, said, `I do not understand you.' I raised my voice, but she, determining to shelter the infirmity of age at my expense, replied, `I am not so deaf, sir, but really you speak such broken English, that I cannot understand you.' This was too much, and I might have betrayed my vexation, if an intelligent and laughing glance from my friend had not restored my good humour, and a second reflection, suggesting that it was far more important to the old woman's happiness that her vanity should remain unimpaired, than it could be to me to have mine reduced, even to fragments, I humbly begged her pardon, and relapsed into a contented silence, solacing myself with the thought, that our encounter was but an illustration of that of the china and earthen jars. But I will not weary you with detailing all the trials of my philosophy, but only confess that the negligence of the servants was not the least of them—the grinning self-complacency with which these apes of their superiors signified to me that my wants might be deferred. “After all, my humble position would not have been so disagreeable, if I had been accustomed to it. The world's admiration, like all other luxuries, in the end becomes necessary, and then, too, like other luxuries, ceases to be enjoyed, or even felt, till it is withdrawn and leaves an aching void. If this is Irish, set it down to my broken English. After dinner, I followed the ladies to the drawing-room, and was presented by my friend to Miss —, a reigning beauty. She received me with one of those gracious smiles, that a hacknied belle always bestows on a new worshipper at her shrine. These popular favourites, be it clergyman, politician, or beauty, are as covetous of the flatteries they receive, as a miser is of gold. No matter how unclean the vessel from which the incense rises; no matter what Z base alloy, may mingle with the precious metal. Have you ever encountered one of these spoiled favourites in the thronged street, and tried to arrest the attention for a moment; to fix the eye that was roving for every tributary glance? If you have, you will understand without my describing it, the distrait manner with which the belle received my first compliments. Even this was not long accorded me, for a better accredited and more zealous admirer than myself appearing, she left me to my meditations, which were not rendered the more agreeable by my overhearing an old lady say, in a voice, which, though slightly depressed, she evidently made no effort to subdue to an inaudible key, `I wonder what possessed Robert Ellison to bring that French portrait painter here! How the world has changed since the Revolution! There is no longer any house where you don't meet mixed society.' My friend had approached in time to overhear her as well as myself. `The ignorant old fool!' he exclaimed, `shall I tell her that artists are the nobility of every country?' “`No,' said I, `do not waste your rhetoric; there is no enlightening the ignorance of stupidity; a black substance will not reflect even the sun's rays.' “Ellison then proposed that I should join a party at whist; but I complained of the heated air of the drawing-room, and, availing myself of my insignificance, I followed the bent of my inclinations, a privilege the humble should not undervalue, and sauntered abroad. The evening was beautiful enough to have soothed a misanthrope, or warmed the heart of a stoic. Its peace, its salutary, sacred voice restored me to myself, and I was ashamed that my tranquillity had been disturbed. I contemned the folly of the artificial distinctions of life, and felt quite indifferent to them—when alone. “The ground in front of my friend's house slopes to the Hudson, and is still embellished with trees of the majestic native growth. Where nature has left anything to be supplied by art, walks have been arranged and planted; but carefully, so as not to impede the view of the river, which was now in perfect repose. A sloop lay in the channel, its sails all furled, idly floating on the slumbering surface. While I was wishing my friend were with me, for I am too much of a Frenchman to relish fully even nature, the favourite companion of sentimentalists, in solitude, I saw a boat put off from the little vessel, and row slowly towards the shore. Presently a sweet female voice swelled on the stillness of the night, accompanied by the notes of a guitar, struck by a practised hand. Could any young man's mercury resist moonlight and such music? Mine could not, and I very soon left behind me all of terra firma that intervened between me and the siren, and ensconced myself in a deeply shaded nook at the very water's edge, where I could see and hear without being observed. The boat approached the spot where I stood, and was moored at half a dozen yards from my feet; but as my figure was in shadow, and sheltered by a thick copse of hazel bushes, I was perfectly concealed, while, by a flood of moonbeams, that poured on my unsuspicious neighbours, I saw them as plainly as if it were daylight. These were two men, whom I soon ascertained to be the captain of the sloop and an attendant, and that they were going to a farm house in the neighbourhood for eggs, milk, &amp;c. The two females were to remain in the boat till their return. The lady of the guitar was inclined to go with them as far as the oak wood on the brow of the hill; but the captain persuaded her to remain in the boat, by telling her there was a formidable dog on the place, which she might encounter. As soon as the captain was gone, her companion, an elderly, staid looking country woman, said to her, `Now, child, as I came here for your pleasure, you must sing for mine. None of your new-fangled fancies, but good Old Robin Grey.' “`Oh, Robin Grey is a doleful ditty; but anything to reward you for indulging me in coming on shore.' “She then sung that touching ballad. The English, certainly the Scotch, excel us as much in the pathos of unembellished nature and truth, as we do them in all literary refinement, ingenuity, and grace. I know not how much of the tribute that gushed from my heart was paid to the poetry and music, and how much to the beautiful organ by which they were expressed, for the fair musician looked herself like one of the bright creations of poetry. I would describe her, but description is cold and quite inadequate to convey an idea of her, and of the scene with which she harmonized. It was one of nature's sweetest accords; the balmy air, the cloudless sky, the river, reflecting like a spotless mirror the blue arch, the moon and her bright train; my enchantress, the embodied spirit of the evening, and her music the voice of nature. I might have forgotten that I was in human mould, but I had one effectual curb to my imagination; one mortal annoyance. Argus, confound him! had followed me from the house, and it was only by dint of continued coaxing and caressing that I could keep him quiet. Before the ballad was finished, however, he was soothed by its monotonous sadness, and crouching at my feet, he fell asleep, I believe. I forgot him. Suddenly `the dainty spirit' changed from the low breathings of melancholy to a gay French air—the very air, Berville, that Claudine, in her mirthful moments, used to sing to us. The transition was so abrupt that it seemed as if the wing of joy had swept over the strings of her instrument. I started forth from my concealment. That was not all. Argus sprang out, too, and barking furiously, bounded towards the boat. The old woman screamed, `There is the dog!' and the young lady, not less terrified, dropped her guitar, and unhooking the boat, she seized an oar and pushed it off without listening to my apologies and assurances. In her agitation she dropped the oar, and her companion, still more tremulous than herself, in her attempt to regain it, lost the other, which she had instinctively grasped. As soon as the first impulse imparted to the boat was expended, it scarcely moved at all, and I had leisure to explain my sudden appearance, and to say that my dog, far from being the formidable animal they imagined, was a harmless spaniel, who should immediately make all the amends in his power for the terror he had caused. I then directed him to the floating oars. He plunged into the water and brought them to me, but he either did not, or would not understand my wish that he should convey them to the boat, which, though very slowly, was evidently receding from the shore. I then without farther hesitation, threw off my coat, swam to the boat, and receiving there the oars from Argus's mouth, I soon reconducted the boat to its haven. There was something enchanting to me in the frankness with which my fair musician expressed her pleasure at the homage I had involuntarily paid to her art, and the grace with which she received the slight service I rendered her. Perhaps I felt it the more for the mortifying experience of the day. I do not care very nicely to analyze my feelings, nor to ascertain how much there was of restored self complacency in the delicious excitement of that hour.” “The elderly lady, for lady she must needs be since my fair incognita called her mother, expressed a matronly solicitude about the effect of my wet garments, but I assured her that I apprehended no inconvenience from them, and I begged to be allowed to remain at my station till the return of their attendants. The circumstances of our introduction had been such as to dissipate all ceremony. Indeed this characteristic of English manners would have as ill fitted the trustful, ingenuous, and gay disposition of my new acquaintance, as a coat of mail her light, graceful person. Z 2 She sung at my request, our popular opera airs, with more effect, because with far more feeling, than our best professed artists. She talked of music, and of the poetry of nature, with genius and taste; and she listened with that eager and pleased attention, which is the second best gift of conversation. I should have taken no note of the passage of time but for the fidgetting of the old lady, who often interrupted us with expressions of her concern at the captain's delay, for which he, quite too soon, appeared to render an account himself. As I was compelled to take my leave, I asked my fair unknown if I might not be allowed to think of her by some more accurate designation than the `Lady of the Guitar.' “`My name is'—she replied promptly, and then, after a moment's hesitation, added, `No—pardon me, your romantic designation better suits the adventure of the night.' I was vexed at my disappointment, but she chased away the shade of displeasure by the graceful playfulness with which she kissed her hand to me as the boat pushed off. I lingered on the shore till she had reached the vessel, and then slowly retraced my steps towards the house. I was startled by meeting my friend, for my mind was so absorbed that I had not heard his approaching footstep `Ah!' he exclaimed, `is this your philosophy? turned misanthrope at the first frown from the world.' “`My philosophy,' I replied, `has neither been vanquished, nor has it conquered, for I had forgotten all its trials.' “My friend evidently believed, notwithstanding my disclaimer, that my vanity required some indemnity for the humiliations it had sustained, and he repeated to me some assuaging compliments from his father. `But,' he concluded, `tell me, have you really turned sentimentalist, and been holding high converse with the stars?' “`With a most brilliant star,' I replied, and related my adventure. “Ellison's curiosity was excited, and he proposed we should take our flutes, go out in the barge, and serenade the `Lady of the Guitar.' I, of course, assented, and the next half hour found us floating around the little vessel like humble satellites. We played an accompaniment and sung alternately, he in English, and I in French; but there was no token given that the offered incense was accepted; no salutation, save a coarse one from the captain, who invited us to go `on board and take some grog.' We of course declined his professional courtesy. `Then, for the Lord's sake, lads,' he said, `stop your piping, and give us a good berth. Sleep, at this time o'night, is better music than the jolliest tune that ever was played.' “Thus dismissed, and discomfited by the lady's neglect, we resumed our oars and were preparing to return to the shore, when the cabin window was gently raised, and our fair incognita sung a sweet little French air, beginning `Adieu, adieu!' We remained, sound, motion, almost breath suspended till the song was finished.” “So sweetly she bids us adieu, I think that she bids us return,” said my friend, and we instantly rowed our boat towards the stern of the vessel. At this moment the sash was suddenly dropped, and taking this for a definitive `Good night,' we retired. “Now, dear Berville, I have faithfully related the adventures of my masquerade—my boyish pastime, you may call it. Be it so. This day has been worth a year of care and dignity. I shall return to New York in a few days. Till then farewell. Yours, Constant.” But though M. Constant professed himself satisfied with his day, there was a lurking disquietude at his heart. He had written to assure himself there was nothing there he dare not express, and yet he had concluded without once alluding to the cause of his self-reproach. He had folded the letter, but he opened it, and added;— “P. S. I did not describe to you my friend's vexation that the responded song was in French. `Ah!' said he, `I see there is no chance for such poor devils as I, so long as you are neither married nor betrothed.”'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE CANARY FAMILY. I paid a visit to my friend Sophia, yesterday. I could describe her; but if the portrait did justice to her peculiar loveliness, every one who knows the original would know it, and that she would not like; for she is not a subject for an exhibition picture, but for an image to be worn next the heart. I may say of her, for in this feature of her character I trust that many of my young friends resemble her, that she has certain delicate chords in her composition that vibrate to whatever is beautiful and loveable. Her first glance and smile win a child's love; the most delicate flowers thrive under her culture as if they were in their native atmosphere, and the most timid birds are soon tamed by her gentle usage, and seem to make her their intimate and confidential friend. Her favourites, at present, are a little family of canaries. She gave me their history, and it is evident that she has observed their conduct, and studied their characters, with an interest similar to that which a tender mother feels in her offspring. She, who watches over her little dependents with such love, must be a more accurate observer than the bird-fancier, who rears the bird, as the slave merchant trains his captive, for the market. We, therefore, request our readers will believe our story, and we pledge them the word of a faithful biographer that we will not add a single fictitious circumstance to embellish it. Sophia being much alone, procured a canary, as an innocent and pleasant companion. She preferred a male, because the male birds are gifted with the sweetest song. The little creature soon seemed to feel quite at home in Sophia's boudoir, and attached to his gentle mistress. As far as he could, he made his society agreeable. He seemed never tired of singing to her; would flourish quite a pretty little accompaniment when she played on the piano; would perch on her shoulder, for she allowed him the liberty of the room; and sometimes daintily pick from her plate when she was eating. In short, he did his best to be happy in his solitude, but after a while he got the blues, became silent, and drooped, and Sophia said it was not good for birds any more than man to be alone, so she went to Lawrie Todd's, the immortalized florist and bird-fancier, and selected the prettiest little damsel in the aviary to be a companion for our sighing bachelor. Some persons have thought that if the President of the United States appointed all the matches in the country, they would prove full as happy as they now do. Certain it is, that if our little friend had had the pick of his own bright isles, he could not have been better satisfied, than he was with the selection his mistress had made for him. He and his helpmeet were a picture of conjugal harmony, and she, a thrifty little wife, soon began to build her nest, and thus prepare for the expected wants of a young family. Sophia took care that she should not lack materials. She hung within the cage a net-bag, containing hay and hair. The husband seemed anxious to aid her, and certainly did his best, but he was clumsy at house-work, and Sophia observing that the little lady hardly gave herself breathing time, and afraid that she would overwork herself, contrived, while Mrs. Canary was taking a hasty dinner, dexterously to intertwine some of the hairs in the nest. But even Sophia's delicate fingers were not equal to the art of the bird. At the first glance at her nest, she lost her sweet temper, flew into a violent passion, went to work like a little fury, and in half a minute she had extricated every one of the hairs inserted with such pains, and then arranging them with the nicest skill, she seemed to say, “Shall a mortal presume to mingle her coarse labour with that of a heaven-instructed bird?” Her mate stood by, the while, and it may be, laughed in his feathered sleeve, to find his little wife a lady of such spirit, and, like a prudent husband, resolved never to provoke it. Sophia placed feathers within reach, aware how very carefully the bird prepares the inside of the nest, the part that is to come in contact with the unprotected skin of the young bird. It was affecting to see with what pains the little creature cut off, with her bill, the quill of the feather, as we have often seen a careful mother remove every pin and needle that could by possibility scratch her child. Sophia once more interposed, and with better success. She scraped some very soft lint and put into the cage. This service, Mrs. Canary very thankfully accepted, for thanks are certainly best expressed by using well the gift. She instantly caught up the lint, and in a very short time completed the nest. Sophia says, and she has a right to know, that there is as much difference in individual character among birds as human beings; and that lady-birds sometimes, as well as ladies, make very indifferent house-wives. But our heroine was not one of these. She was a pattern. Her nest was as exactly formed as if it were done by a mathematical rule, and the entire labour of constructing this beautiful little edifice was performed in one day. In the course of a week four eggs were deposited in it; and in eleven days, or one fortnight after, I have forgotten which, four birds, three males and one female, made their appearance. And now the young husband, become a father, was more devoted than ever. He was an epicure for his wife; selected all the delicate morsels for her, and aided her in feeding the young ones. She, like all good wives, was a keeper at home. He was a pattern of conjugul kindness. Except when employed in procuring food, he laid his head beside his mate's, and if any stranger came into the apartment, he would start up, sit on the side of the nest, half extend his wings, and fix his eye on the intruder, as much as to say, “If any discourteous knight disturb my lady-love, I will do battle in her behalf.” But his chivalric spirit was not called into action. Sophia took care that no one should rudely approach the cage, and the happy little family was unmolested. It was a scene of perfect domestic happiness, which, a poet says, (I do not believe him,) is the “Only bliss that has survived the fall.” Who would have thought that at this moment a cloud was gathering over this harmonious contented family. Adjoining the house in which Sophia lives is a public garden, one of the favourite resorts and prettiest embellishments of our city. I wish I could transport all my young friends there, that they might realize some of the beautiful visions that have floated around their brains when they have been reading the Arabian Tales. The garden is laid out with taste, enriched with plants of every clime, and filled with the delicious odours of Cape jasmines and orange flowers. Every thing is managed with taste. Before a saloon in the centre of the garden is a pyramid of fragrant leaves and bright blossoms, formed by placing pots on circular benches around a pump, which but for this floral drapery would have been a deformity. Every evening the garden is lighted by coloured lamps hung in arches over the walks, illuminated columns, and fantastic transparencies. One broad avenue terminates at one extremity by noble mirrors, that multiply to apparent myriads the crowds that resort to this fairy land. At the other end of this avenue a painting is hung, in which the walk is so well represented by the art of perspective, that it seems to stretch as far as the eye can extend; a winding path leads to a grotto, embellished with shells and corals, and sparkling with crystals; a fit bower for the pretty naiads. In another secluded nook is a hermitage, which seems to be in a deep and rocky recess, where sits a hermit, “reverend and gay.” I would not advise my young friends to examine all these things by daylight, lest they should find they had been deceived by false appearances. There is no harm in an agreeable and innocent illusion. But to return to our canaries, whom we left at the moment of impending evil. Sophia, as we said, had always allowed her first canary the liberty of the room. The weather had now become so warm that she sat with her window raised, and the bird, either tempted by the sweet odours that rose from the garden, or the love of liberty, and probably not aware of the danger of separation from his family, flew out of the window. Sophia was alarmed and distressed, and she immediately hit on the most probable expedient for recovering the wanderer. She had her cage conveyed to the garden. The little rover was skimming the air and perching on the green branches, but the moment he espied his mate and her little ones, he flew to his house again, preferring captivity with them to freedom without them. The cage was again taken in hand to be reconveyed to the boudoir. Mrs. Canary seemed agitated and flurried with the sudden changes in her condition; her little head was turned with joy at the recovery of her mate. She flapped her wings against the wires of the cage, lighted on her perch, and on her nest, and finally, for the door of the cage had been carelessly left open, out she went. It was evident she was bewildered. The cage was set down in the hope that the instincts of the mother would bring her back, but I have no doubt the poor little creature was like a person suddenly deprived of reason. She flew round and round, as birds are said to do, when fascinated by a snake. There were some wild sparrows flying over the garden, they hovered around her. This seemed still farther to alarm and distract her; the little vagrants encompassed her; enclosed her within their circle, and drove her off, and she was forever lost to her bereaved family. I do not doubt her widowed mate felt all that bird could feel. He expressed his affection for his lost companion as good husbands should do, by the most devoted care of the little ones. Sophia was a foster mother to them, and he was father, mother, every thing. It was really affecting to see his care of them. It was as much as he could do, with all the aid Sophia gave him in cracking the seeds, to supply food to the hungry little fry; the poor fellow really became thin, while they grew apace. Perhaps some of our young readers may not know how the parent prepares the food for the young bird. An egg boiled hard, a lettuce leaf, seeds and water, were all placed by Sophia within the bird's reach. He would take a little of each, and appear to roll the whole in his mouth till it was formed into a paste. Then he seemed to swallow it; for when he was ready to distribute it to the birds, he made a motion with his throat, like that which is necessary to recover what is partly swallowed. While the birds were very young, one preparation would suffice for the whole; but in a few days, three of them would cat all their father could prepare at once. He was not discouraged at this, but went patiently to work again. Sophia was alarmed lest he should forget which was the unfed bird; he never mistook, but always, like a just and good parent, made an equal distribution to all his children. Never did a nursery, under the care of the most experienced nurse, thrive better. At the end of the week the female bird, the only female in the brood, was hopping off her nest. She was the most forward, knowing bird, of her age, ever seen. In a fortnight, B B she flew about the room, and lured her timid brothers to adventure forth. She continues to manifest the same bold, enterprising, independent character. A friend of Sophia's who had admired, from day to day, the devotion of the father to his young, very kindly sent him the best reward of his fidelity, another mate. When I saw the family last, his second wife had built her nest, though not half so well as her predecessor. She was sitting on her eggs, and was most affectionately tended by her husband. Sophia complains that he has become somewhat of a hen-hussy, and had rather be cowering over the nest than abroad on the wing, with his gay flock. They all live harmoniously with the step-mother, save the little vixen of a girl; and she pecks and scolds the lady-mama, who bears her pettishness with calmness and dignity, and will, I doubt not, in time, subdue the little shrew. THE END.</field>
