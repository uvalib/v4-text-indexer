      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. THE conspiracy and insurrection of the United Irishmen, were undeniably of the most interesting, and, perhaps, of the most important character of any that ever agitated a country. Its leaders exhibited a combination of talents, courage, and disinterested patriotism, which has but seldom been equalled, and which, in conjunction with the generous nature of the principles for which they contended, could not, and did not fail to attract towards them the admiration and sympathy of all classes of men in Christendom, without excepting even those against whose authority their arms were wielded. Their enterprise failed, whether fortunately or unfortunately for mankind, it is not the business of the novelist to inquire; but had it succeeded, and the designs they had formed for the advantage of their country been realized, what epithets of praise would have been considered too high for their deserts? Their cause would have been called holy, and their efforts glorious. Even as it is, all parties admit that they were zealous for their country's good. The purity of their motives is not denied; it is only the accuracy of their views, and the soundness of their principles that are called in question. Whatever our own judgment on this subject may be, we have refrained from expressing it; and in writing the following narrative, which, we seriously assert, contains numerous facts that have never yet appeared in print, the course we prescribed for ourselves was that of strict impartiality not only in relating the events, but in detailing the opinions, and delineating the characters of the different parties. The United Irishmen and the loyalists, are permitted to express their sentiments with equal force and freedom. The fanatical and the fierce on either side, are painted as such, while the moderate and lenient, we hope, have ample justice done to the rationality of their views. We have thought it necessary to say this much in behalf of the neutrality of our plan, because many of the actors in the scenes we have described, are yet living, whose prejudices either for, or against the principles which occasioned the contest, may induce them to expect either a defence or reprehension of their doctrines and conduct. These men, whether republicans or royalists, must expect no such thing, and we caution politicians of every creed, against identifying our private sentiments with those of any of the characters we have drawn. These characters are drawn nearly as we A 2 knew them in life; and with respect to the events, it was our lot, although then in our childhood, personally to witness many of them; of many others of the class, that assume to be historical, we have obtained our information from sources of unquestionable authenticity. As to these events, however, we will not deny that we have exercised the privilege of our calling, by giving to many of them the colouring of romance; but during the singular period that has supplied our subject, numberless exploits and transactions took place highly enough coloured of themselves, and requiring no embellishment from fancy to suit them to the appetite of the most choice admirer of extraordinary facts that ever derived gratification from novel-reading. These it was not thought necessary to array in any other garb than that of the simple truth. For any further information that may be wanted relative to the writing of these volumes, the reader is respectfully referred to the following INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS to himself, in which he will find that he is spoken to plainly and familiarly, as one friend should speak to another. Judicious Reader, Having the enjoyment of thy good opinion very much at heart, I cannot but feel extremely anxious respecting the impression which my hardihood in submitting the following history to thy perusal, will cause thee to imbibe concerning me. There may be innumerable errors in the work, which I cannot discover, but which may be very apparent to thy superior discernment. While therefore, the great object of my ambition is to appear in thy sight a very wise man, thou mayest be inclined to look upon me as a very great fool, for expecting to acquire thy esteem by such a trifling—or as thou mayest, peradventure, say, silly performance. It hath, in these latter times, been the custom with some authors, who, like me, have approached the awful tribunal of thy judgment with trembling steps and palpitating hearts, to attempt evading at least a portion of thy censure, by ascribing the authorship of their productions to persons altogether innocent thereof; and falsely assuring thee that the manuscripts fell accidentally into their hands, and that they are only the editors. By this means they expect to deceive thee into the belief that they have been guilty only of the fact of publishing, and consequently, are not answerable for any imperfections in either the design or execution of the performances. O! sons of disingenuity and fraud, how vain are your efforts to impose on the wise people of this sagacious age? Your shallow artifices are easily seen through, and not one novel-reader in ten thousand believeth your foolish statements on this subject. In vain doth the pathetic author of the “Man of Feeling” assure us that he rescued the manuscript of that affecting work, from the unfeeling fowling-piece of a fat, sporting curate; or that the amiable Mrs. Wistanly made him a present of the original of “Annesly's Sorrows.” It is equally vain for the authoress of “The Modern Philosophers,” to declare, that she found a chamber-maid's brush about to consign the papers containing that cleverly told tale, into a kennel, along with the dirt and rubbish swept from a lodging house. A respectable Dutchman of the name of Knickerbocker, hath also been accused, by Mr. Washington Irving, formerly of New York, of having written an amusing history of that ancient and venerable city: but nobody, now-a-days, believeth him. Fruitless also hath been the attempt of the most prolific of all novelmakers, to deceive the children of this generation, by fathering a number of his own multitudinous offspring, upon a schoolmaster's usher. But it would be tedious, benevolent reader, to go over the catalogue of these writers, who have had recourse to this method of screening themselves from thy condemnation. It will be sufficient to observe that not one of them hath succeeded; but that in consequence of thy great penetration, they have always been detected; and thou hast, as became thy great and inflexible justice, uniformly acquitted the accused, and condemned the accusers. With such warning before my eyes, I would be guilty of something far worse than folly if I should imitate these writers in their detected falsehoods. I shall, therefore, boldly and unreservedly avow myself to be the bona fide author of the following history, and must, consequently, submit to whatever doom thou shalt assign me; as such, humbly requesting, however, that in consideration of my candour in pleading guilty, thou wilt, in pronouncing my sentence, mingle mercy with justice. But, although, my dear reader, I cannot, with a safe conscience, deny being guilty of having both written and published this history, yet I will make a statement to thee, which, I trust, thou wilt consider as, in a great degree, apologizing for my fault. By this statement thou wilt perceive that I had either to commit that fault, or lose one hundred and fifty pounds a year, which, as I am like too many other authors, but a poor man, I hope thou wilt think that I acted wisely in securing. The facts are these: My aunt Nancy, who died about two years ago, bequeathed me her whole property, amounting to the before mentioned annual sum, well secured in real estate for ever, on condition that I should, within three years after her demise, write and publish such a narrative of the rise, progress, and termination of the conspiracy and insurrection of the United Irishmen, interweaving therewith such an account of the views and feelings, manners and customs of the people of Ulster, at the conclusion of the last century, as would meet with the approbation of her executors. In default of my performing this condition, she ordered her property to be distributed, in equal proportions, between nearly three-score and ten nephews and nieces; to prevent whom from enjoying their several pittances, I hope thou wilt, indulgent reader, think that I was in prudence bound to make an effort; especially, as I found that the greater number of them were not much inclined to thank their deceased relative for her bequest. Thou wilt, no doubt, wish to know what could induce my aunt Nancy to make such an odd disposal of her property; and, as I am desirous to gratify all thy reasonable wishes, I shall, with pleasure, inform thee. My aunt, as thou already perceivest, was a curious woman. She was sixty-one years in this world, and lived all that time in a state of single blessedness; and, what is as true as some may think it strange, she did so from an actual preference of that state to the more popular one of connubial felicity. When I first remember to have known her, she was on the upper side of forty; of a tall, slim figure, with small, keen, hazel eyes, a nose tolerably well sized, but somewhat sharp pointed, and a chin of more than ordinary longitude. In fact, the contour, (pardon a French word, dear reader, I shall not often offend in that way) of not only her countenance, but her whole person, was remarkable for the length, thinness and keenness of its aspect. The effect of this natural conformation upon the beholder, was very much increased by the fashion of her dress, which was that which prevailed during the earlier half of George III.'s reign. Its most prominent parts were a long-bodied gown, closely fitted to a pair of tightly-laced stays, which reached from the arm-pits to the haunches, and compressed the whole body into the smallest possible dimensions; a huge head-dress, called a “mob,” which towered half a foot higher than a grenadier's cap above the crown; and shoes, the tapering heels of which elevated their wearer several inches from the ground. When my aunt stood upright in this uniform, she was no bad representation of what may be seen in several of our large cities, a tall slender iron bar stuck into a thick stone pillar, and supporting a large globular lamp at its top. So much for my aunt's person. As to her manners, she was rather precise and serious in her deportment, and perhaps, possessed a little too much affected gentility, and was too solicitous about the minute forms of politeness, to be quite agreeable; besides, she had contracted a filthy habit of using snuff immoderately. But as she was, upon the whole, tolerably good natured for an old maid, and, as she always made an excellent cup of tea, and was somewhat of an epicure in good toast, those who were familiar with her could occasionally contrive to spend a comfortable evening at her table. With respect to her mind, she had, in her youth, improved it much, by reading a multitude of the most exquisite and wonderful plays, novels, and romances in the language. For the last ten years of her life, however, she had devoted her faculties to the graver studies of the history, antiquities, geography and statistics of her native island; and, as a natural consequence, she had latterly permitted politics also to engross a great share of her attention. Amidst the immense multitude of volumes which she had persued on these subjects, she was surprised to find none that gave any thing like an accurate account of the people among whom she had spent her whole existence; and whom her local partialities induced her to consider the most interesting, if not the most important people on the earth. She was much chagrined with the carelessness with which even professed travellers through Ireland have uniformly mentioned its northern province. Some, she would say, seem to treat the people of Ulster as altogether beneath their notice; others take delight in making them the objects of misrepresentation and slander, while none manifest for them that sympathy and respect, to which, from their spirit of enterprise and industry, they are assuredly entitled. The authoress of the “Wild Irish Girl” particularly provoked her indignation, by the invidious and unfair comparison she hath drawn, in that work, between the Southern and Northern inhabitants of the Island; for she thought that an Irishwoman at least, ought not to have been so wilfully and unjustly abusive of any portion of her countrymen, even if they did not happen to be descended from Milesian ancestors, and were unable to speak the original language of the country. She ought, especially, to have spared her attacks upon that portion, to whose activity and intelligence the nation is chiefly indebted for whatever it possesseth of either prosperity or importance. My aunt was also much displeased at the very partial and inaccurate accounts which have been given to the world of the motives, designs, and transactions of the Northern United Irishmen; and, as she conceived that her opportunities of knowing the facts entitled her to be a tolerably good judge of B these matters, she took the greater liberties in condemning the writers of such accounts. During the last two or three years of her life, she had, by constantly meditating, conversing, and writing on this subject, excited herself to such a pitch of enthusiasm concerning it, that she declared that she would not die contented unless she would meet with something approaching, at least, to a fair statement of the manners of the people of Ulster, and of the part they had taken in the late rebellion. But all her inquiries after such a work were in vain; and, it is said that the vexation, occasioned by this disappointment, greatly contributed to bring on her last illness. However that may be, the tenor of her will proves that she had laid the matter much to heart. I hope, therefore, that if, where she now is, she still feels the same interest concerning it, the work which I now submit to thee, dear reader, will yield her gratification, and remove her uneasiness. It has already been approved of by her executors, and has consequently procured me her property; and it now only wanteth thy approbation to procure me that reputation, which I would esteem a far more valuable reward for my humble efforts in its production. Having told thee what caused me to become an author, I may now mention how I became capable of being one. My father who was far from being abundantly supplied with any other possession except a numerous family of sons and daughters, could not afford to expend much worldly substance upon my education. But on account of the studious disposition which I had manifested from my infancy, I had early become a great favourite with my aunt. She, therefore, generously took the charge of this matter upon herself. It was the wish and intention, of both her and my father, to prepare me for the pulpit, and I have accordingly been, for many years, a probationer, belonging to that learned and reverend body, the Synod of Ulster. But not being gifted with sufficient efforntery to make a good preacher, I believe, now that I have come into the undisputed possession of my aunt's income, I shall give up the employment, for which I had never any great predilection, and shall follow a life of literature, if thou, kind reader, by thy patronage of my present work, wilt give me any encouragement thereto. If not, I must content myself with creeping indolently and uselessly through this weary world; and, if the withholding of thy patronage hath been owing to the evil counsel of any ill-minded critic, upon the head of such critic be all the blame of my indolence and uselessness, for my own conscience will acquit me thereof. Benevolent reader, thou wilt see, by the following pages, that I had, in writing them, another object in view besides gaining my aunt's money. I also wished to give all the great men of the earth, of whom peradventure thou art one, a good advice, not to be too rigid and harsh with those in subjection to them, but to treat them with kindness and good nature, and leniently overlook their faults, as, I hope, thou wilt overlook mine.

      <field name="fulltext">B 2 O'HALLORAN; OR, The Insurgent Chief. CHAP. I. A gallant youth, just fresh from college halls, With love of nature glowing in his breast, Roams venturously amidst her wildest scenes, With fervid and romantic admiration— Thaunus the Druid. Perhaps no where in the British Islands, will the admirer of the grand and sublime, in the works of nature, find more gratification than along the northern shores of the county of Antrim. From the Gabbon precipices, near the entrance of Larne Harbour, to Port Rush, near Colerain, a long range of rocky coast, extending upwards of fifty miles, exhibits, in some places, the boldest promontories jutting into the sea, and perforated with numerous caverns, into many of which the raging waters pour with reverberating noise. In other places, small bays, occasioned by the mouths of the rivers and rivulets that there seek a junction with the ocean, interrupt the continuity of the rocky chain, and by affording to the visiter the view of towns and villages, surrounded by the fertility of nature, and the conveniences of art, produce a striking and pleasing contrast to the prevailing wildness of the coast, and make its grandeur still more grand. The Giant's Causeway, which forms a part of this wonderful coast, has long been an object of astonishment, both to the philosopher and the peasant. It is annually visited by travellers from all countries, where science excites curiosity, and the wonders of nature inspire admiration. Edward Barrymore was in his twenty-second year, and had just finished his education at Trinity College, when he resolved to visit this interesting coast, and examine with his own eyes, those immense structures, of which he had heard so much, and which, both as a man of science and of taste, he was so well calculated to enjoy. It was in the afternoon of a very fine day, in the month of May 1797, when he arrived at the promontory of Ballygally. He alighted and sent forward his servant with the horses to the next town, which was about three miles distant, intending after he had explored the cliffs, to follow along the beach on foot. He descended the crags, and got to the beach, when turning round a huge rock, he perceived an elderly gentleman, with a young lady, advancing along a sandy portion of the shore towards him. Not wishing to be seen, and, at the same time, struck with the appearance of the lady, he concealed himself in such a manner, that he had a fair view of them, without being himself noticed. They advanced slowly until they came to the bottom of the rock where he was stationed, when all at once they disappeared; but not until they were so near, that he heard the lady utter the following exclamation: “Oh father, what miseries are in store for thousands!” and, immediately he was startled with a sound, as if part of the cliff on which he reclined had broken off. Full of astonishment, he got down to the bottom of the rock, but could perceive no traces of the persons, who had just the moment before excited so much of his attention. Their sudden disappearance was to him quite unaccountable, unless he should suppose, that they had found admission into some cavity within the rock. He viewed it at every accessible point, and minutely examined every fracture and crevice, in the hope of discovering some concealed entrance, but in vain. He imagined, however, that he heard, as from a distance, the sounds of footsteps and voices; but they soon died away, and left nothing audible, but the screaming of the sea-fowl, and the dashing of the waves upon the shore. Edward, however, determined to remain near the spot until night, in hopes that something might take place that would lead to an explanation of the mystery. For this purpose, he chose a recess on a level with the beach, under an over-arching ledge of the precipice, by which he conceived the fair vision, and her companion, if they were really mortal, must return, as he knew that there was no passing by the way he came, unless by clambering up the rocks, a task which would be almost impracticable for the lady. Having a small volume of Dryden's Virgil in his pocket, the loves of Æneas and Dido, soon engrossed his attention, and the time unheedingly stole away, until the shades of twilight aroused him from his situation. The tide, which had been advancing all the time, now rolled at his feet, and rendered it impossible for him to retreat from his recess without the greatest danger. He was a good swimmer, but the shore was unknown to him, so that he could not tell how far he might be from any spot, where it would be possible to land. To stay where he was, was evident destruction. The tide encroached rapidly upon him, and he had no alternative but to encounter the wave. He, accordingly, plunged in, and endeavoured to gain the mysterious rock, for the purpose of escaping by the way he came. A current of water, however, that issued, now that the tide was so far advanced, between that and another rock farther out in the sea, rendered his efforts unavailing, and becoming exhausted, he expected nothing but immediate dissolution. In this situation, he heard a scream, and immediately a loud voice calling, “Swim a little more to the right, and out to sea—I shall help you!” He obeyed, and got out of the influence of the current that had baffled him, but was on the point of sinking with fatigue, when a powerful arm seized him, and dragged him to the shore in a state of insensibility. When Edward recovered, he found himself in bed, in a small apartment belonging to a respectable farm house. The mysterious gentleman was employed rubbing his breast with warm spirits, while his fair companion sprinkled hartshorn drops over his brows and temples, and occasionally applied them to his nostrils. An elderly peasant woman was also busy rubbing his feet and legs with warm flannels. “Oh, father! thank heaven! he breathes,” were the first sounds heard by Edward, on his recovery. “God be praised! then all is well,” was the reply. He lifted his head to look at his preservers, and to thank them, but his voice faultered, and he could only press the hand of the young lady, in token of gratitude. A lovely blush suffused her countenance, but she spoke not; while her father exhorted Edward to remain silent, as perhaps exertion, in his present exhausted state, might be attended with bad consequences. Edward obeyed, for his mind was so distracted with the hurry and variety of his reflections, and the strangeness and intensity of his emotions, that he knew not what remarks to make, or if he knew them, he could not find suitable expressions to convey them. He was glad, therefore, to conceal his confusion in silence. He was not long in this confused state of agitation, approaching almost to delirium, until a doctor, for whom the old gentleman had sent immediately on getting him ashore, arrived from Larne, the adjoining town. After extracting some blood, and administering a composing draught, he ordered the room to be kept quiet, so that the patient might have an opportunity in silence and repose, to recover from his fatigue and agitation; then giving a few other necessary directions, and assuring the by-standers, that all danger was over, he took his leave, promising to return the next morning. The old gentleman and his daughter, then wished Edward a good night, and retired. Left to himself, he gave a range to his imagination, on the strange occurrences of the day. His fair attendant still seemed to bend over him, as she did when he first opened his eyes from his trance; and the fervour of her joyful exclamation, at his recovery, still seemed to reverberate in his ears. His exhaustion, however, and the influence of the medicine he had taken, soon interfered with these waking dreams, and he fell into a refreshing sleep, which continued till midnight. When he awoke he found that he had been attended by two decent-looking elderly people, a man and woman, who appeared to have been reading a newspaper. Not perceiving when he awoke, they continued the conversation which had been excited by the newspaper. “An' they are raising a subscription for the benefit of Orr's family, an' I this day put my name down for half a guinea, for you know, my dear, that what is gi'en to the persecuted, in a guid cause, is never lost; besides, I would not let it be said, that William Caldwell, refused to help a man who was suffering for his country.” “Ah, my dear, you did well to gie the money, but I wish these things may come to a good end. There's sea mony sodgers in the country, and sea mony informers, and sae mony kingsmen, that I'm feared the poor United Irishmen will never do ony guid. Not but I wish God may bless the cause, for if they get leave to gae on, they will persecute and kill a great mony more of us, for no crime at all, as they did poor Murphy, an' the four militia men at Blarismoor. But though I love Mr. O'Halloran, I wish he could not have persuaded you to join the United Irishmen, for I fear this work will bring trouble on us all.” “I could not help it. He argued that it was my duty; told me how poor Ireland was enslaved— an' when he mentioned the sufferings of Orr, an' the killing of Murphy and the militia men, I felt my blood get warm, and I tauld him, I would tak' the oath, let what like come o't!” Here Edward not wishing longer to act the mean character of a listener, especially to such discourse, made a noise, as if he had just awoke from sleep. He asked what hour of the night it was. The woman told him; when having enquired how he felt, she requested permission to bring him some wine and toast, which she said the doctor had allowed him to take, as soon as he wished for refreshment. “The wine,” she remarked, “must be very good, for it was sent from the castle by Mr. O'Halloran, God bless him, just of the kind he kept for his own use. Oh! Sir! how fortunate it was, that he and Miss Ellen were at the Point, when you were a drowning, otherwise you would hae been drowned altogether, for he jumped into the sea, and saved you, just when you were sinking the third and last time? And then, Miss Ellen, how she attended to you till you recovered! God bless her every day she rises, for she's as good as an angel, and as beautiful too.—But I was forbidden to speak owre muckle to you, for fear I should disturb you; but you look sae weel, that I'm thinking my talk doesn't hurt you.” Edward assured her that he was delighted with her communications, and begged to know whether Mr. O'Halloran lived far off, and whether he might not have an opportunity of thanking him the next day in person, for the important service he had rendered him? “Oh! that you will,” she replied, “for he lives only about a mile off, and I'm sure he will be here in the mornin', for he will not be easy till he sees himsel' that you are gaun to lieve an' be weel.” “And the young lady,” said Edward, “does she live with him? Is she his daughter?” “She is his grand-daughter; but he still calls her his own child, for since that jewel o' a woman, her mother, died she is now all that he has.” “Jenet!” cried the husband, “you disturb the gentleman owre much wi' your cracks. You had better let him sleep. The doctor said sleep would be good for him. Come awa', we'll send Peggy to tend him.” “Aye, aye,” said the wife, “Peggy is a tidy lass, an' winna mak' sitch a clatter as I hae done. Poor thing! she's amaist owre shy, to speak much. Guid night! or, rather guid mornin', sir; sleep sound, an' whatever you want just ask it frae Peggy, an' you'll get it at yince.” They both left the room, and Edward had just begun a train of reflections on the strange incidents of the preceding day, when the door gently opened, and a pretty modest-looking peasant girl, apparently about seventeen years of age, entered the apartment without noise. As Edward lay quiet, treading on tip-toe, she slowly approached the bed in order to ascertain if he were asleep. Presuming that he was, for he purposely feigned to be so, she was about retiring in the same slow and noiseless manner, when wishing to detain her, that he might get some more information concerning O'Halloran and his lovely grand-daughter, he asked, in a tone as if he had just awoke, if any one was there? “Yes, sir,” was the reply, “my mother sent me to see if you wanted ony thing.” “My pretty girl, I want nothing but to enquire in whose house I am, and by what strange accident I have been brought here?” “The house is my father's, William Caldwell's, and you were brought here carried by Mr. O'Halloran, our landlord at the castle, quite dead, for he found you drowning, in the sea, at the Point Rock.” “And are you acquainted, Miss Caldwell, with the young lady his grand-daughter?” “With Miss Ellen? yes, I am sir, right well, for she has no pride at all. She sends for me often to walk with her from one house to another, when she visits the poor sick people of the neighbourhood, and carries things for their use; and, we often go together to the top of the hill, when it is a clear day, where we can see Scotland and the ships passing back and forwards. For, she says, it is a beautiful sight, and takes great delight in looking at it.” “And, my dear girl, does she ever speak of her parents? Do you know any thing of them?” “I remember her mother. She died about seven or eight years ago, when I was a very little girl. Miss Ellen was then very little also; for she is not quite two years older than myself. She often talks about her parents, and laments their misfortunes so much, that it makes her rather pensive in her C disposition, though she is generally one of the merriest and liveliest young ladies you ever knew. Her father, it is said, fled the country for fear of being punished for killing some lieutenant in the army, in a duel, when she was but an infant.” “Have they never heard of him since?” “Not that we poor country folk know of.” “Did you ever hear his name?” “Yes; his name was Hamilton, and she should be called Miss Hamilton, but her grandfather will let her be called nothing but Miss O'Halloran.” “Has she any brothers or sisters?” “No; her father and mother did not live long together. They never had any children but herself.—But, sir, the doctor told us not to fatigue you by talking to you, too much. Would it not be better to leave you to your sleep? for you must be very weak and distressed after being drowned. If you want any thing, tell me, for I ought not to stay longer with you, unless to attend you.” This impatience in Peggy, arose from the manner in which Edward had almost unconsciously caught her hand, and pressed it rather warmly, as he listened to her account of Ellen's parentage. Peggy's cheeks displayed a blush, which plainly discovered that she felt the indelicacy of her situation with a young man, who in place of being as she expected, half dead with drowning, seemed quite alive to all the impulses of gallantry and feeling. He checked himself, however, and bade her good-bye, thanked her for the information she had given him, and the attention she had manifested to his comforts. The alarm that Peggy felt was quite natural, and, to handsome young women who have been in similar situations with handsome young men, any explanation of it would be unnecessary. Even Edward felt that her withdrawing had relieved him from an impending danger. For whether it was occasioned by the sweetness of her looks, or the interest he took in her communications, he felt, as he pressed her hand, a warmer tide of blood than usual, flowing from his heart, which was not cooled for some minutes after her leaving the room, when the idea of the fair Ellen, excited a flow of affections, more congenial to his principles, and more agreeable to his feelings, because more capable of being approved of by his reason. The various agitations of his mind, together with the still fatigued state of his body, however, soon again found relief in sleep, from which he did not awake until the arrival of the doctor, accompanied by O'Halloran and his granddaughter in the morning. The doctor found him rather exhausted, with a slight degree of fever, which, although chiefly caused by the state of his mind, was readily enough accounted for by the preceding day's accident. He was assured, however, that the only inconvenience that could result, would be a few days confinement. O'Halloran was desirous that he should be conveyed to the castle until his recovery; which, after the adjusting of some preliminaries, such as apologies and expressions of gratitude on the part of Edward, and assurances that he considered it nothing but his duty, on the part of his deliverer, was at last effected. The doctor then having given some directions for his management, took his leave, carrying a letter to Tom Mullins, Edward's servant, whom it was expected he should find at the Antrim Arms, in the town of Larne. In this letter he informed Tom of the accident he had met with, and instructed him to continue at the inn until further orders, without communicating to any one his master's real name or quality, as he had important reasons for wishing to remain unknown in this part of the country for some time. Edward Barrymore, was of a very conspicuous family, distinguished alike for its rank, wealth, and devoted attachment to those political principles, which had set the family of Brunswick upon the British throne. With respect to England, their politics were exactly those professed and acted upon by the whigs of the country. Hence they were in favour of extending every kind of indulgence to the dissenters, and had opposed the American war, and lord North's administration. In Ireland, however, where their principal property and influence lay, they supported every high-handed measure of the government, and were rigid sticklers for the protestant ascendancy. Whatever were their motives for such difference in their political conduct with respect to the two countries, it is certain that they acted only as many other great Irish families at that time did. Their avowed reasons were, that it would not be safe to allow the mass of the Irish community the same political privileges, that might with advantage be allowed the English, because the former were chiefly catholics, professors of a religion which, they insisted, inculcated direct hostility to the establishments of both church and state, in either country. Those sentiments, while they made the family of Barrymore high in favour with the ruling powers, caused them to be looked upon as no better than tories, by those protestants, whose views with respect to their catholic fellow-subjects were more liberal. By the catholics, they were held in utter detestation, as their natural enemies, and as the supporters of a tyrannic system of government, which had deprived their ancestors and themselves of some of the most valuable privileges of the constitution. At the period at which our history commences, Edward's paternal uncle, the earl of Barrymore, was a member of the Irish privy council; and, his father, who was a member of the house of commons, had distinguished himself by his strenuous opposition to some measures, which had recently been introduced into parliament for the relief of the catholics. In consequence of these circumstances, Edward supposed, that if he made himself known, he should be no welcome guest in the house of O'Halloran, whose political principles, he had reason to believe, were in direct opposition to those of his family; and, as he could not venture to incur the dislike of the lovely Ellen, or her venerable grandfather who had saved his life, he determined on concealment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">C 2 CHAP. II. One evening as I wandered forth, Along the banks of Ayr, I spied a man whose aged step Seemed weary worn with care; His face was furrowed o'er with years, And hoary was his hair. Burns. On the fourth evening after his arrival at O'Halloran Castle, our hero (for the reader will, by this time, have perceived that Edward Barrymore is that important personage) being considerably recovered, took a walk in company with his host and Ellen, along the beach, in order once more to view the spot that had likely to have been so fatal to him. Returning homewards, they took a path along the edge of a rivulet, that led to a small glen, not more than the fourth part of a mile from the Castle. The ground was overspread with primroses, violets and daisies; and the ash, elm, and beech trees that skirted the banks of the stream, were intermingled with abundance of willows, sweetbriars, and honeysuckles, which had opened their blossoms, and yielded a delightful fragrance; while a thousand warblers from amidst their branches, produced a melody, the sweetness of which can only be known by those who are acquainted with the music of the Irish groves, in the spring and summer seasons of the year. Struck with the beauty and romance of the scene, Edward paused. “This, indeed, Mr. O'Halloran,” exclaimed he, “is a delightful place.” “Yes, Mr. Middleton,” (which was the name Edward had assumed, being that of his maternal relations) “our country is, indeed, a pleasant one. Her soil is fertile, her sons are brave, her daughters fair; but she is an oppressed country—she is a betrayed country. Thousands of her sons have sold themselves to strangers, whose delight is to rule her, not with a sceptre of justice, but with a rod of cruelty; and a country that has been blessed by Heaven, is accursed by man.” “My friend,” replied Edward, “I will not, I cannot, altogether differ with you, in those sentiments; for, I believe that the authorities of the country, have not done as much as they could to promote its prosperity. They have not attended sufficiently to the encouragement of industry among the poor, by directing their attention to internal resources, and facilitating that spirit of enterprise among the wealthy, which would not only discover and establish sources of employment at home, but greatly contribute to extend our commerce abroad.” Edward had scarcely finished this remark, when the attention of the party was drawn to a man of peculiar appearance, who advanced slowly towards them. On coming forward, he took off a gray cap, made of rabbits' skins, which had covered a head the hair of which was as white as snow, and making a respectful bow, asked God to bless them, and was passing on, when Edward, who wished to avoid renewing the political conversation, and whose curiosity was really excited by the appearance of the stranger, thanked him for his civility, adding, “My good sir, perhaps you are like myself, a stranger in this part of the country, and not having the good fortune to meet such friends as I have met with, may require some assistance from those who may be willing to afford it.” So saying, he held out a handful of silver to the stranger, which, to his astonishment, he refused; but without any air of offended pride. “Although I am a forsaken old man,” said he, “I cannot take your money. In this glen it would do me no good. Mr. O'Halloran and my other neighbours supply me with food, I get water from that brook, and very little more clothing than I have on me, will be sufficient to cover my carcass, until the grave covers it.” Edward was in the act of putting up his money, when a coarse unhesitating voice called out briskly, “Giff auld Saunders dinna tak' yere money, my bonny young gentleman, ye need na' be at the pains to pit it up; Peg Dornan winna refuse it.” Edward turned round, and beheld a stout weather-beaten woman, in the habit of a beggar, apparently between forty and fifty years of age. She made a low, unceremonious courtesy, and held out her hand for the money. Edward hesitated; but in the most unabashed manner, she continued— “Giff ye dinna like to gie't, I'll no' be affronted; but his honour there can tell you I'll no' drink it.” “I cannot answer for that, Peg,” said O'Halloran, “and you should be ashamed to ask any gentleman's money in so rude a manner.” “It's likely you may be richt,” said Peg, “ye ken them things better than I do; but gin the gentleman likes, he may either keep it or gie't; I'll no' insist.” Edward now saw something so amusingly independent about Peg, that he immediately handed her the money, enjoining her not to make a bad use of it. She made another courtesy, and told him, she would buy herself a new bonnet, and wear it on Sundays, for his sake, though he might never see her again. “But gin ye should na,” she continued, “bonny Ellen will, an' surely that will gie you pleasure.” She then stalked away, with such a solidity of step, and length of stride, as gave Edward the idea of a female Hercules. “This Peg Dornan,” said O'Halloran, “is one of the most forward beggars in this part of the country, whereas our friend Saunders here, is one of the most modest pensioners that ever lived on the public bounty.” The old man's face seemed to redden a little at this remark; and again wishing God to bless them, he bade them good evening, and ascending the glen a little further, disappeared among the bushes. Old Saunders, as he was called in the neighbourhood of O'Halloran Castle, appeared to Edward to be about sixty years of age. His beard was of a flaxen white, and about an inch in length. His eyes were of a dark blue colour, possessing a greater degree of liveliness than might have been expected from his advanced age. His height in the prime of life, might have been nearly six feet, but as he now bent forward very much when he walked, it did not seem more than about five feet eight inches. His gait, bent as he was, was evidently firmer and indicated more strength than could have been expected from his age. He wore a dark brown great coat, which looked as if it had done the service of half a century. His cap of rabbit skins we have already noticed. His waistcoat had nothing peculiar, except its being made in the old fashion, with the pockets inserted into large lappets, that hung half way down his thighs. It was variegated in its appearance, owing to some heterogeneous patches with which it was here and there ornamented; but the ground work seemed to have been gray cloth, similar to that which formed the great coat. His breeches were of dark velvet, but were now pretty much party-coloured, in the same manner, and from the same cause, as the waistcoat. They were bound at the knees by a huge pair of buckles, that might have belonged to some cavalier in the days of Charles the Second. As to his boots, they exhibited nothing singular, except their uncommon strength and size, and the sameness of colour which existed between the tops and the legs. There only remains to be mentioned, a belt which he wore round his waist, and which, at a distance, resembled a military sash, with a sheath at each side for a dirk or a pistol; but which, on a nearer approach, discovered itself to be a more harmless appendage—it being nothing more than a common horse girth, with a buckle and a large loose-hanging strap at the one side, and containing at the other, a pouch for holding any little donation that the country people forced upon him. For it was remarkable of old Saunders, that he never carried a bag on his shoulder like another beggar. As he was a good scholar, he was fond of voluntarily teaching the children of those who were charitable to him; so that there was scarcely a family in the parish to which he did not, in this way, give value for what he received from it. When he left our party, as before stated, to an inquiry of Edward, O'Halloran replied, that the old man's habitation was in the side of a hill, at the upper extremity of the glen, and only a short distance off. “It is about five years,” he continued, “since he came to this part of the country. As I found him to be a sensible man, and even somewhat of a literary disposition, I, at one time, prevailed on him to open a regular school; but being rather of a melancholy temper, and fond of solitude, he in a few months, gave up that employment, and retired to this glen, where he now leads altogether the life of a hermit. He has become much esteemed in the neighbourhood, having rendered himself very useful to the people, by occasionally teaching their children, and advising them in their perplexities. So that a number of them are as punctual in sending to his habitation their weekly donations, as if he had a legal claim upon them. I have myself wished to enjoy more of his society than he appears inclined to permit; and when curiosity has at any time, prompted me to make any inquiries into the history of his life, I have been always checked by the reserve he has ever shown on that subject, although he is communicative enough on every other. After sunset he never admits any one into his dwelling, otherwise we might visit him, and you would be sure of a kindly reception.” “Mr. Middleton,” said Ellen, “must not think that it is from any surly humour, that our Recluse keeps his cell sacred from visiters after sunset. Although we have found him often pensive, I believe surliness forms no part of his character; much less can he be suspected of any superstitious whim in this part of his conduct, as I have found him more liberal than most men in such matters. I believe that it is from a mere wish to enjoy his own meditations uninterrupted, that he has adopted this rule; for without it, such an enjoyment would be impossible, on account of the social temper of his neighbours, and the esteem in which they hold him. Indeed, it is my opinion, that, if he would permit it, his cell would every night be made the scene of boisterous conviviality.” Conversing in this manner, they had nearly reached the outer gate of the castle, when a horseman overtook them at full speed, and delivering a packet to O'Halloran, rode off again without saying a word. As soon as they entered, O'Halloran hastily broke the seal, and evidently with some emotion, glanced over the contents. He then suddenly told Ellen that he must be absent for a few hours, and desiring that a light and some refreshments should be left in his library to await his return, he bade Edward good night, and hastily withdrew. On finding himself alone, with a lovely young woman, of whose influence over his heart, Edward was, by this time, fully aware, he felt embarrassed; and although he had abundance to say, he found himself utterly destitute of expression. Silence for a few moments ensued. At length he made an effort, and approaching Ellen, remarked— “It is a remarkable circumstance, Miss O'Halloran, that when the emotions of the heart are most acute, the capability of expressing them, is the most difficult.” “Sir,” said Ellen, hesitatingly, “your observation, I believe, is just. Moderate emotions may be expressed without effort, but strong and extraordinary feelings, require language correspondently strong to do them justice.” “And, therefore,” resumed Edward, “not at all times to be commanded. How well Miss O'Halloran, have you accounted for the difficulty of speech, under which I now labour? My sensations since I first saw you, have been of that extraordinary character, of which common language can convey but a feeble idea.” “Mr. Middleton,” she replied, “the extraordinary and almost fatal circumstances, under which your acquaintance with my grandfather commenced, being still recent, may very well account for the extraordinary feelings you mention. You are still feeble from your late accident. Neither your strength of body, nor tone of mind, is yet recovered; and, consequently, occurrences seem strange, and make an impression on you, that, in other circumstances, you would have scarcely noticed.” “I cannot, Miss O'Halloran, attribute my present agitation, in the slightest degree, to this cause. I scarcely feel the worse for the accident, and am persuaded that I should in a short time forget it altogether, were it not for the feelings of gratitude and admiration for your grandfather and yourself, that it has excited, and, which, believe me, it shall be the study of my life never to forget. Oh! how happy I should be, if I only enjoyed the confidence, the favourable opinion of persons, to whom I am so much indebted, and who shall be for ever so dear to me!” “That favourable opinion,” she observed, “we are never in the habit of withholding from those we think deserving of it. Hitherto our impressions concerning you, are, I believe, as much in your favour as you could wish, and until you do something to forfeit our esteem, of which I am not afraid, I can almost assure you, that you shall enjoy it.” Edward was about thanking her for her kind sentiments, and vowing never to forfeit them, by any voluntary thought, word, or action of his life, when he was prevented by a servant entering with the tea equipage. During the time they sat at table, although not an expression was uttered by either of them in the presence of the servant, that might not have been dictated by mere politeness, yet, if any disinterested person of discernment could have seen them, he would have been convinced that their thoughts ran more upon each other, than upon the whole world besides. Many a stolen glance they mutually detected, and many a tender thought was only half expressed, lest it should be expressed with all the tenderness with which it was conceived. On the part of Edward this embarrassment only occasioned a few blunders, which he got over pretty well, as there was no one present who laughed at them; but on the part of Ellen, the detected glances, and little slips of the tongue, occasioned blushes, which were only rendered more apparently lovely and interesting, by her attempts to conceal them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">D CHAP. III. In varying cadence, soft or strong, He swept the sounding chords along; The present scene, the future lot, His toils, his wants, were all forgot, Cold diffidence, and age's frost, In the full tide of song were lost; And, while his harp responsive rung, 'Twas thus the latest minstrel sung. —Scott. After tea, Ellen, afraid of a renewal of the love conversation, proposed to call up Mr. Arthur O'Neil, the harper, who had, for several months past, generally attended two evenings in the week, for the purpose of instructing her on that instrument. Although at that moment, perhaps, Edward would have preferred an arrangement which would have given him her company alone, he acceded to the proposal. He was rejoiced at the opportunity of seeing the only individual then living of that venerable race, whose profession had once been so respectable in Ireland; and he seized the occasion to enlarge on a subject dear to the heart of Ellen, and gratifying to his own, the praise of the bards of their native country. He was observing that no country had ever possessed a race of men who so much excelled in all the tenderness and pathos of music, or who had produced strains of sentiment so much calculated to affect the heart, when the old, blind musician appeared, led by a boy whom he kept to attend him. He was struck with his appearance. He looked upon him as a remnant of antiquity; and was ready not only to pay him respectful attention, but to yield him all that veneration and homage which was once yielded to the bards of Tara. Indeed, the appearance of Arthur O'Neil, detached from any consideration of his profession, was sufficient to command an uncommon degree of respect. He was nearly sixty years of age, and in height about five feet ten inches, robust, but not unwieldy in his person. His head was gray, and somewhat bald towards the front, displaying the wrinkles, but not the debility, of age, upon his high and arching forehead. His nose was of the most dignified Roman make; while his whole countenance, which was oval, although somewhat weather-beaten, exhibited a freshness, which indicated that the possessor had long enjoyed a healthy and active frame of body. His coat was of dark brown cloth, made in the old fashion, wide in the skirts, and without breasts. His waistcoat was a little longer than usual, but had no affectation of singularity in its construction. In short, the whole of his apparel was characterized, not by its peculiarity, but by its comfort, decency, and durability. After an introduction to Edward, in which the usual Irish salutation of “God bless you” was not forgotten by the venerable minstrel, he adjusted himself to his harp, and began the beautifully sweet air of the “Blackbird.” When he had done, he asked Ellen if she had committed to memory the verses to that air, which he left with her on his last visit. On her replying that she had fulfilled his desire in this instance, he expressed a wish that she should sing them, while he accompanied her voice on the harp. She, at first, hesitated, but on Edward joining in the request, she complied; and with a voice sweet as a seraph's, at least so it sounded in her lover's ears, she sung as follows: On Ballygally's summits wild, The slowly-setting sun delay'd, The dewy lips of evening smil'd, In nature's vernal charms array'd; Soft fragrance scented every shade, From every tree soft music fell, While zephyrs wanton'd o'er the mead, Fraught with the sweets of Tobergell. As musing here I chanc'd to stray, A lovely maiden caught my view, To whom creation seem'd to say, All these my beauties are for you! The fragrant gale, the pearly dew, The wild-bird notes with love that swell, Each night their off'rings here renew, To you, sweet maid of Tobergell! She slowly trod the flow'ry lea, Soft, modest beauty in her mien; Oh! who could stand unmov'd to see, So fair a nymph, and fair a scene! My quick'ning pulse, and rapture keen, Confess'd the charms that did impel My very soul to tread the green, With the sweet maid of Tobergell. Not in the palace of the great, The diamond blaze of lab'ring art, Must we expect the happy seat, Of scenes whose beauties reach the heart: But feelings pure, spontaneous start, That raise the soul with mystic spell, To taste what nature's sweets impart, In scenes like these at Tobergell. Give me a home midst bow'rs like these, With such a maid as this to gain, And health, and just enough of ease, Sometimes to weave the rural strain: Then bustling pomp, and grandeur vain, Away! with me, ye ne'er shall dwell, For happy here I'll still remain, With the sweet maid of Tobergell. “Ah! poor M`Nelwin,” exclaimed O'Neil when she had finished, “how gratified he would be to hear that sweet voice sing his verses! The poor lad was afraid you would be displeased at his presumption in sending them to you; but I knew you were too good for that. He said you might think that he wished to flatter you, but he declared every sentiment of the piece to be the genuine dictate of his heart, when he wrote it.” “Mr. O'Neil,” she replied, “you may return the young man my thanks for the compliment he has paid me. Tell him that I respect his poetical talents, and that I am proud of his favourable opinion; but that I hope he will, for the future, select a more worthy subject for his complimentary effusions, than he has done on this occasion.” “That, I believe, is impossible,” said O'Neil. “It is—it is absolutely impossible,” thought Edward. Then starting suddenly, as if he had just awoke from a trance, “Miss O'Halloran! Mr. O'Neil,” said he, scarcely knowing what he said, “I beg pardon for not expressing my admiration sooner of your performance. Either the musician, or the poet, or the singer, or perhaps the combination of the merits of the whole three, produced such an extatic impression on my feelings, that I found it impossible for some moments to collect my thoughts sufficiently to thank you in a rational manner; and, believe me, I can, with your poet, sincerely say, I do not flatter.” “Mr. Middleton,” said O'Neil, “your enthusiasm of compliment is highly gratifying; but I make no doubt that the sweet voice of the singer has had the greatest share in exciting it.” “You, too, can compliment as well as Mr. Middleton,” said Ellen, “but if I may give an opinion, I must ascribe a great deal of our friend's present enthusiasm, to his patriotic delight in listening to the strains of his country's favourite and venerated instrument.” “In our inquiry into the causes of our friend's D 2 delight, we must not forget the poet,” replied O'Neil in a lively manner. “If not the verses themselves, at least their subject must have been in unison with his feelings.” “I believe you will allow me the right to settle this controversy,” said Edward, willing to relieve Ellen from the embarrassment into which the harper's last observation had thrown her. “It would be ungallant, as well as untrue, to deny the share which the sweet songstress has had in administering to the pleasure afforded me this evening. You must, however, take to yourself, Mr. O`Neil, a due portion of the merit. What Irish heart that reveres the ancient music of his country, and is proud of her former excellence in this most delightful of all arts, but must feel an unusual glow of satisfaction, on seeing for the first time, the only remaining branch of that illustrious stock of bards to whom her musical eminence is to be ascribed; and on hearing for the first time, the inspiring tones of that instrument, on which they awoke those soul-moving numbers, that, at once, constituted the delight of our ancestors, and their own immortality. The recollections thus produced must, indeed, be thrilling!” Edward made a pause. O'Neil sighed, and appeared to be too much affected to reply. He, however, poured forth the fervour of his soul upon his harp; and pathetically swept the chords, accompanying their tones with the following words of a song written by his friend M`Nelvin. Oh! the days are long past since the music of Erin, Delighted her sons in the mansions of kings, Since her chiefs in the joys of the festive board sharing, Were rous'd by the magic that flow'd from the strings! O! 'tis long since the patriot heart was affected, By strains that the deeds of our forefathers told; And long since the bard and the harp were respected, By Irishmen free, independent and bold! Our island long flourish'd the pride of the ocean, As the olive of Europe, she bloom'd in the west, And learning when chas'd by war's barb'rous commotion, In her shamrock-clad vales found protection and rest. Our bards then with rapture oft sang of her glory, While the harp sweetly sounding accompanied the strain: Each patriot heart fill'd with antiquity's story, Felt the warm pulse of gratitude throb in each vein! But despis'd by the stranger, who felt not his numbers, The bard is now sunk in obscurity's vale; And the harp quite neglected, in deep silence slumbers, Except when awaken'd to sorrow's sad tale: But there is an ardour and strength in the spirit Of Irishmen yet, that shall bid them arise, And the day brightly dawns when the bard shall inherit, The praise of his country, his dearest of joys! When he had finished, he exclaimed with energy, “Do not fear—I shall no more be the last of Irish harpers, than M`Nelvin shall be the last of Irish poets. Yes; gloomy as our present prospects now are, a day shall yet dawn in which the bard and the harp shall flourish together, and be cherished in the hearts of Irishmen.” He then requested Ellen to come forward, and receive a lesson. She had scarcely seated herself to the harp, when a servant entered with the following note, which he delivered to Edward. “The old man whom Mr. Middleton met in the glen this evening, and to whom his benevolence prompted him to offer charity, solicits the favour of an interview. He shall wait for him at the place where the late rencontre happened until 10 o'clock.” Edward immediately obeyed the summons, telling Ellen that he had occasion to go but a short distance, and did not expect to be long absent. On arriving at the place mentioned he found the Recluse true to his appointment. “Follow me,” said he to Edward; and he led the way up the glen until they came to a place altogether overgrown with trees, shrubs, and brambles, and various other kinds of undergrowth. They then turned to the left, and keeping close along the margin of the stream, in a few minutes came to the bottom of a precipice between thirty and forty feet high, which formed one bank of the rivulet, a corresponding precipice banking it on the other side. These banks approached almost close to each other at the upper termination of the glen, which was formed by their gradually widening and diverging from each side of the brook until they were lost in gentle swellings on the sea shore. A small distance farther up the brook than where these banks began to leave it, a beautiful and romantic cascade was formed by the water rushing over a breast of rock nearly as high as the banks themselves, and which formed their junction. But before coming to this cascade, Edward and his conductor reached the mouth of a cavern which the latter said was the entrance of his abode. When they entered a few yards, they were stopped by what Edward supposed to be the solid rock at the farthest extent of the cavern; but the recluse taking a key from his pocket, soon opened a door which the darkness had prevented him from seeing. They now entered a large clean apartment with a well baked earthern floor, at one side of which blazed a large turf fire. It also contained several chairs, a table, a large lumber chest, a few working utensils, a large old fashioned bureau, and several mats of straw heaped on each other for a bed, and covered with bed clothes looking extremely clean and comfortable. “You are welcome to my habitation,” said the old man. “Why really” replied Edward, “you have a more comfortable dwelling beneath the surface of the earth than many I have seen above it.” “As to that, you have as yet only seen one portion of my abode. I shall now introduce you to another, and you will be aware of the progress you have already made in my estimation, and the confidence I repose in you, when I tell you that you are the second individual living to whom I have ever opened its door.” He then approached what Edward supposed to be the large bureau, and touching a concealed spring in one side of it, it flew open and displayed to view a handsome parlour, lighted with two wax candles, having a boarded floor, and plastered and ceiled in the neatest manner. Edward's astonishment was still more increased, when advancing, he perceived at the farther end a large and elegant assortment of books, arranged along shelves which seemed to have been erected in a temporary manner for the purpose of containing them. “The surprise I perceive in your countenance,” said the old man, “is natural. But sit down, and I shall, in part, account for what you see, by stating that I am not the person which to the world I appear to be. I have met with misfortunes, Mr. Barrymore! Do not startle. I know your name, and about five years ago received some civilities from you at Trinity College. You were then, to be sure, less firmly made than at present; but I think I cannot be mistaken as to your identity with the individual to whom I allude.” Edward acknowledged the identity, and confided to the old man his motives for concealing his real name from O'Halloran's family. The old man approved of them. “You have entrusted me with a secret which I shall keep,” said he. “I shall now entrust you with one of more importance. Indeed it was for this purpose I requested this interview. Your's is one only of a temporary nature, mine involves very serious interests. It is calculated to affect no less than the life of a man whom we both highly esteem. But it is from a regard to that life, that I entrust you with it. By enlisting your family influence in favour of this person, I foresee that it will be one day in your power to contribute to his safety. To him you owe the preservation of your life. To him you are therefore bound by gratitude. I shall commit the secret of his offences to your bosom, honour will, therefore, bind you not to betray him, and I know you possess honour. But there is, as I before suspected, and as you have just now confessed, another circumstance, a tie which binds you to his interests, if not of a stronger, at least of a more endearing nature than either gratitude or honour—I mean love; for the filial affection of his granddaughter, I am convinced, is so strong that she would never survive his public execution. Ah! sir, I tremble for that young lady, when I think of the danger into which the ardent but mistaken patriotism of O'Halloran is likely to involve him. I have endeavoured for several months past, to prepare her mind for whatever calamities may overtake her, by lessons of fortitude. But I still dread the consequences of her grandfather's imprudence. I wanted a coadjutor to assist in delivering him, if possible, when the day of calamity shall come. For I clearly perceive that such a day is fast approaching—how far it is distant I cannot tell—but come it will. On such a day I shall have a recourse to you. I know your power is great and your heart is willing. I thank that Providence which threw you in my way before the cloud had burst; and I look upon it as a favourable omen, which bids me hope that Ellen Hamilton and Henry O'Halloran, the two dearest objects I have on the earth, shall survive the fury of that storm under which thousands are doomed to fall.” Edward was affected with the Recluse's fervency. He assured him that he would, at any time, be ready to undertake any thing that should contribute to the safety of O'Halloran, and the happiness of Ellen. He hoped, however, that whatever were the circumstances which occasioned such an alarm in his mind, they would not entail the misfortunes he apprehended. That if he would inform him of the particulars he should be the better prepared to act on any emergency, and he might rely upon his honour, without taking into view the high interest he felt and ever must feel for the welfare of O'Halloran and his granddaughter, as a sufficient pledge of secrecy, so long as secrecy should be attended with any advantage to either of them.” “I am satisfied on that head,” said the Recluse, “your political principles, opposed, as I know them to be, to those of O'Halloran, will not, I am persuaded, prevail with you to break through the various ties of honour, gratitude, and love, which bind you to the interests of this worthy but mistaken old man. Yet I cannot but think that your conscience will scruple at enlisting your services in behalf of a man, whom, when you are informed of the whole of his conduct, (and of the whole of it you must be informed before you can be sensible of the extent of his danger,) you will be inclined to look upon as a traitor to his country, and to that constitution of government, which, from your youth, you have been taught to venerate and consider as the most excellent that ever was framed for the benefit of society.” “I indeed acknowledge my admiration of the excellencies of the British constitution,” replied Edward. “At the same time, I am sensible that it contains a great many imperfections; and, in various minor points, should be an advocate for its amendment. But, whatever may be my opinions on this subject, depend upon it they never can alter my affection for the interesting family to whom I owe so much. Still, I hope, that Mr. O'Halloran has not acted so as to deserve the severe epithet of traitor, which you have applied to him.” “Would to God!” said the Recluse, “that I were unjust in applying that epithet to him. But, I greatly fear, that when you hear the particulars, you will be but too much convinced that the laws of this country would make the same application. Against that statute which defines treason to be the abetting and encouraging the enemies of the country, it is but too true that with many others of the society with which he is connected, he has offended. That it does not amount to treason to be a United Irishman, I am aware; and if my friend were only such, I should neither feel the uneasiness, nor give you trouble concerning him, which I now do.” “I am ignorant,” said Edward, “of the designs of the United Irishmen. But I am aware that their association has occasioned a great deal of disturbance in the country; although I am also aware that the severe measures resorted to by the present administration to suppress this association, may have provoked many of the atrocities that have been committed. As, however, you are better acquainted with their proceedings and intentions, I shall be glad of your information; but of this you may be satisfied, that nothing you can tell me of a mere political nature, shall lessen my esteem for our friend, or alter my resolution to serve him, if ever Providence shall so order it that I may have the power.” “This,” said the Recluse, “is the point I wished to gain. I shall not, therefore, hesitate to communicate all I know concerning O'Halloran's connexion with this association. Among the United Irishmen there are numbers of virtuous characters, and, at the commencement of the society, it was joined by men of the purest patriotic and constitutional principles. The avowed object of its founders, was only to unite all classes of Irishmen, without regard to religious distinction, in exertions to obtain those rights, and the redress of those grievances which the volunteers had failed to obtain. The three leading objects with them, are the same for which many of our best and most enlightened statesmen, both in and out of parliament, have long contended; namely, a reform in the representation of the commons, emancipation of the catholics, and a melioration of the tythe system. These are just and constitutional demands for the people to make; and had the government granted them to the solicitations of the volunteers, we should never have heard of United Irishmen. But the administration became jealous of that gallant army of patriots; and as soon as they no longer needed their aid, not only stopped short in their reluctant concessions to their just demands, but in defiance of the wishes of the nation, occasioned their disorganization. “Some of the leaders of the volunteers, and other men of restless and active dispositions, and many, no doubt, from the purest motives, determined to persist in urging their claims; and, since they were forbidden to arm as a public body, they resolved to arm as a secret society. The plan they adopted was originally suggested by Theobald Wolfe Tone, whom I have frequently seen in this part of the country, on his visits to ascertain the progress of the association, and to give instructions respecting the management and regulation of its concerns. Mr. O'Halloran, who had been a leader among the volunteers, became active in recruiting for the new establishment, which, at its origin, was E hardly considered in any other light than as a substitute for that which had been so arbitrarily and unwisely suppressed. “Unfortunately the French revolutionists began at this time successfully to propagate their disorganizing doctrines throughout all Europe. Numbers of their emissaries were scattered over Ireland, and, in consequence of their exertions, a spirit of innovation upon every kind of ancient establishment spread itself rapidly among the people. This was, however, somewhat checked by the seeming spirit of conciliation which the ministry of Britain manifested in sending the earl Fitzwilliam, a man who was known to be friendly to the popular wishes, as viceroy to the country. Happy it would have been for the people, and happy also for the government, had he been permitted to remain at the head of our affairs. The United Irish Association would, of itself, have desolved by being gratified in the principal of its wishes. But, unfortunately, it was not the design of Mr. Pitt and his colleagues that the people should be gratified. Accordingly the popular viceroy was withdrawn. He left Ireland in tears, which I am afraid will never be dried until they be changed for blood. His successor, lord Camden, you are aware, has adopted a different system of government. Instead of a redress of grievances being granted, oppression is increased, under the plea of suppressing treason, until numbers have actually been irritated into treason, who would otherwise have remained peaceable and loyal; and the red arm of vengeance has been bared to inflict punishment for crimes that would never have been committed, had not the same arm been previously employed in oppression. To Camden's ill-fated and ill-managed administration, the whole of the evils that now overspread the land are to be attributed. By passing the impolitic law of the last session, called the Insurrection Act, which has for a season, surrendered the liberties of the people into the hands of an executive that has shown itself so ill disposed to make a proper use of such a trust, the parliament has sharpened the sword of oppression, and given a cruel sanction to the military outrages that are now committing throughout the country. That act has permitted the ordinary forms of judicature to be superseded by tribunals, unknown to the constitution, and military courts are now busied, in many places, in hurling the vengeance of power wherever disaffection is suspected, or even wherever it is convenient for interested malice that it should be suspected. “The captivity and sufferings of William Orr, a respectable man of this county, who, under the operation of that unfortunate act, has been, since September last, immured in prison, among many other instances of misgovernment, have contributed much to excite the present incalculable and fearful degree of irritation which has seized the minds of the people of this province. Immense numbers of every class view the present state of things with horror, and the legislature having legalized the oppression under their labour, they also view them without any hope of deliverance, except by an exertion of their own strength. Hence thousands who before the existence of the Insurrection act resisted every solicitation to join the united ranks, are now voluntarily coming forward to enrol themselves upon their lists, and to take the oaths of fidelity to their cause. Ambitious men, in the interests of France, have taken advantage of this enthusiasm among the people, and have, of late, been too successful in infusing principles absolutely treasonable into the minds of many. “Among the most zealous for revenge upon the oppressors of the country, we may consider our friend, Mr. O'Halloran. Excited by the integrity of his nature to a hatred of every species of injustice, and being fearless and persevering in whatever cause he embarks, he has taken a lead in the existing conspiracy, not, like many others, from selfish views, but from the purest motives—from his ideas of duty, and from his feelings of benevolence and patriotism. “Many, however, on the contrary, of the ablest men who were conspicuous at the commencement of the confederacy, have become dissatisfied at the lengths to which matters have latterly been driven, and are now either altogether inactive, or have thrown their weight into the scale of government. But encouraged by the great accession they have received in point of numbers from the lower orders, the more zealous leaders, instead of being discouraged by this defection of the more moderate from their cause, have become bolder in their measures, and have not stopped short of treason in their views. They avow, unreservedly, their intention, with the assistance of France, to establish a republican form of government in this country, altogether unconnected with Britain; and these imprudent men now regulate the whole concerns of the united confederacy. The lower orders look up to them as the only true patriots, and brand those who wish to restrain them in their mad career, with the name of apostates; and it has unfortunately happened in this, as in all other cases of national excitement, that the most violent have become the most popular.” “Is there any system of insurrection yet organized?” enquired Edward. “There is no time, I believe, yet fixed upon for taking the field; but they have given up all idea of again applying to government for a redress of grievances, and appear resolved to trust to arms alone for the success of their cause. Still I am of opinion that conciliatory measures on the part of the government, and granting them their just and constitutional demands, would so separate the members of the confederacy, as to check the progress of the threatened rebellion, and render the machinations of the more violent and fanatical abortive. But I have so little faith in the government adopting these healing measures, that I expect nothing else than a state of things to take place, more disasterous and unfortunate for the country, than any she has ever yet experienced. The government is obstinate, it is oppressive; the people are inflamed, and imprudent, and under the management of ambitious, rash, and desperate men. O! my friend, what misery awaits our unfortunate country?” Edward felt the full force of the old man's sorrow. His heart bled at the prospect thus opened before him of the calamities that were about to overspread the land of his nativity; the land of his affections; the abode of all that was dear to his feelings and pleasing to his hopes, and he heaved a sigh as he confessed that he could see no means by which the threatened misfortunes might be averted. The Recluse now gave him an account of numerous instances of misrule and oppression committed by the government, and of the violent measures frequently resorted to by the United Irishmen in retaliation throughout the northern parts of the country. At length Edward took leave of the old man, with a promise not to depart from the neighbourhood until he should have another interview with him on the subject. On his way to the castle, his heart, distracted with sorrow and with love, became overpowered E 2 with his emotions, and before he knocked for admittance at the gate, which, at that hour of the night, was always closed, he retired into a little arbour behind the porter's lodge, to give vent to his feelings. He had scarcely entered, when a coarse voice called out “Wha comes there?” which he immediately conjectured to be the voice of Peg Dornan. “Is this you, Peg?” was the reply. She started to her feet, muttering, “In the name o' Gude! what brings you here at this hoor of the nicht? Surely you ha' na been out exercising wi' the crappies. Poor lads! they maun aye tak' the dark covering o' the nicht to be drilled, for fear o' the blackguard informers, or the king's red-coats, that would shoot them or hang them without mercy. The deil tak' them!” “Is this where you make your bed at nights, Peg?” said Edward. “Sometimes, sir; ony place does Peg Dornan.” At this moment they heard the sound of voices approaching. “It's his honour,” said Peg, looking out at the entrance of the arbour, “an' anither I dinna ken, gaun to the castle. Na doubt they're talking politics. I ne'er fash my head wi' sic things, except to sing a crappy sang noo an' then, an' to wish Gude to bless the cause, be it richt or wrang.” The speakers were now so near that Edward could distinctly hear O'Halloran saying to his companion “We have now upwards of a hundred thousand men sworn to us in this province, and, I think, we might have things prepared for a general rising as soon as your government can effect the landing of ten thousand troops on any part of the coast. My last letters from the Dublin Directory inform me, that in the various part of the kingdom there are upwards of three hundred thousand United Irishmen and Defenders ready to take the field at the first signal!” To this the other answered—“Our government has the interests of your country much at heart, and if our transports can only escape the fleets of Britain, the number of troops promised you may rely on receiving at the stipulated time.” The sounds now died away, and the encreasing distance of the speakers prevented Edward from hearing more. The fact that French aid in order to assist in separating Ireland from England, was negociated for by the leaders of the United Association, was now to him no longer questionable; and that the only parent of his Ellen, the preserver of his life, was deeply implicated in this traitorous and dangerous measure, sunk heavily to his heart, and impressed him with such a degree of vexation and sorrow, as he had never before experienced. “I will not disturb you longer, Peg,” said he, “when I stumbled in here, I did not expect that the place was previously occupied.” “Guid nicht!” she cried, “and Gude be wi' you; an' thank ye for the money—I had na' sae muckle this twal month before.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. IV. Who has e'er had the luck to see Donnybrook fair, An Irishman all in his glory is there, With his sprig of shillelah and shamrock so green. His clothes spic and span new without e'er a speck, A new Barcelona tied round his neat neck; He comes into a tent and he spends half a crown, Comes out, meets his friend, and for love knocks him down, With his sprig of shillelah and shamrock so green. POPULAR SONG. When Edward had retired to bed and begun to ruminate on the distracted and dangerous state of the country, he found sleep to be utterly out of the question. So many images of the distress and misery about to take place, crowded on his imagination, that when he, at length, fell into a slumber, the state of his mind excited the most frightful dreams. At one time, he thought that his old friend was seized by a party of dragoons, and hanged at the gate of his own castle, which was fired by the military; and, before he could fly to prevent it, he thought he saw his beloved Ellen consumed in the flames. Here the horror of his feelings increased to such agony that he awoke. The day was dawning, and as it was in vain for him to seek again for repose, he wandered to the garden, which was situated at a small distance from the castle. It was a lovely May morning. A thousand warblers saluted the rising sun from the trees and hedges around him. “How happy are you!” thought he, “ye little songsters, when compared with man, that lord of the creation! No vicious, turbulent passions agitate your contented bosoms. You do not, like us, enter into combinations to bring upon each other misery and ruin. Ambition never swells your breasts, nor does revenge goad you on to mutual hatred and destruction. The sweeter and more amiable passions alone find admission into your bosoms, and the enjoyments of love, friendship and innocence seem to be the only occupation of your lives. Your lot is, indeed, that of innocence and joy.” Absorbed in these contemplations, he moved slowly along the garden walks, amidst a profusion of cowslips, daisies, hyacinths, tulips, and numerous other flowers that scented the air all around, and from the leaves and petals of which were suspended myriads of pearly globules, glittering in the early beams of the eastern sun. “But there is one of our race,” thought he, “as lovely as these, whose breast to me is fragrance, and whose voice is music. Oh! may heaven grant her protection amidst the dangers that surround her; for her bosom is the seat of innocence, and her soul too pure for the vengeful feelings of the times!” This soothing walk, and the contemplation of Ellen's charms, calmed the perturbation of his spirits, and he was enabled to meet O'Halloran in a more unembarrassed manner than he expected. After breakfast he signified his intention of going to town, in order to give some directions to his servant, observing at the same time, that, as he wished to remain a few weeks in the neighbourhood, he should take lodgings at the inn where his horses were kept. O'Halloran invited him to make the castle his home so long as he remained in that part of the country. He declined the invitation, but mentioned that he should frequently obtrude upon them as a visiter. O'Halloran then expressed his intention of going to town with him, on condition that he would accompany him back to the castle in the evening, a stipulation with which he complied. On the road, O'Halloran introduced the subject of politics. “You are a young man,” said he, “I believe, of generous sentiments and a liberal mind, and such I have ever found to be possessed of that first of virtues, patriotism. You cannot, therefore, but feel the injustice, cruelty, and despotism, with which the government of Britain has always treated this country. It has been the policy of our haughty, domineering neighbour, ever since we have been so unfortunate as to be connected with her, to treat us as a conquered people. She has taken advantage of our religious dissentions, and made them the means of fomenting divisions amongst us, that she might the more easily oppress us, and incur no danger from her tyranny. We are, however, Mr. Middleton, resolved no longer to be her dupes. The minds of all classes of our people are enlightened, and whether Protestants, Presbyterians, or Catholics, a cordial brotherhood has taken place. We feel oppression, and are resolved to endure it no longer. We know the natural rights of men, and shall assert them in the face of our enemies. They have made us slaves, but we are determined to be free. It is the duty of every true Irishman to assist in such a cause, a cause which cannot but obtain the approbation of heaven, and be successful.” “My friend,” replied Edward, “of all accusations, I should wish to avoid that of being indifferent to the welfare of my country. I feel that Ireland has not a son who more fervently desires her prosperity than I do. I have seen her distresses, and I have grieved for them. I have contemplated the calamities that seem hovering over her, and if a sacrifice of my life, or any other sacrifice in my power to make, could preserve her from them, it should be joyfully offered. Oh, sir! while we were a quiet people, living in obedience to the laws of the land, without embroiling ourselves in impracticable schemes for the attainment of merely abstract and controverted rights, were we not a happy people? were we not in possession of every practical good that could arise from the enjoyment of known laws, and a firm and well regulated government? Our lives and our properties were secure from violence; and no earthly power, except the power of offended laws, could injure us with impunity. I grant that our government has often been wrong. Every thing human is liable to error, and our government is human. We should have been content with applying, in a legal manner, for redress. Ah! my heart is sore to think of the state to which matters have been carried. The administration has been unwise, and the people imprudent. The one is obstinate, and the other rash; and, in all probability, it will require a deluge of blood to extinguish their mutual animosity.” They had now arrived at Larne. It happened to be the monthly yarn market-day, and the market for May in that town, is always the largest in the year. Edward was astonished at the multitude of people of all ages, sexes, and ranks that filled the streets; some for amusement, and some for business, making a confused mixture of sounds, loud and discordant indeed, but at the same time cheerful, lively and diverting. After making their way, with some difficulty through the crowd, they, at length, arrived at the inn where Edward's servant had stopped. They entered a small room where two decent looking countrymen were adjusting the payment of some linen cloth which the one had purchased from the other. After an interchange of civilities with Edward and O'Halloran, he that received the money, insisted on calling for something to treat his companion; and immediately rapping aloud on the table with a small wooden mallet called a bruiser, an instrument used in mixing punch throughout the North of Ireland, a young girl quickly appeared. “Were you calling gentlemen?” said she. “Bring us half a pint of Innishown, with some sugar and water,” was the reply of the linen-seller. Edward wondered at the quantity ordered at once for only two individuals. But as soon as the materials arrived, he found that although O'Halloran and he had not been formally asked to accept a share, they had been provided for in the countryman's calculation. The linen dealers immediately applied themselves to their glasses; and O'Halloran without hesitation followed their example. But Edward declined until he saw that it was necessary for the sake of civility to comply, which he did, however, sparingly. The conversation now turned upon politics; and Edward soon perceived that his two new companions were United Irishmen; for seeing him in the company of O'Halloran, they took no pains to conceal their sentiments in his presence. After commenting on the usual topics of the Insurrection law, and Orr's sufferings, they adverted to the punishment that had been recently inflicted upon one William Murphy, a soldier belonging to the king's artillery, who had become a United Irishman, and deserted. It appeared that he had been apprehended in the house of the man who had bought the linen, and who told them the whole story with as many exaggerations as he thought necessary to ornament the narrative, and blacken the conduct of the military. “Murphy's a damned clever fellow,” said he, “for when the soldiers threatened to burn the house over us if we did not give him up, he jumped out of his hiding place and went out to them, in spite of us all. You are a fool, said I, you might escape out of the back window, and up the loanin, and behind the stack-yard, an' it's ten to one if they would see you, until you would be so far off that they could neither catch you nor shoot you.” “And don't you know,” said he, “that they would punish you for letting me escape?” `Never fear that,' said I, `they have nothing against me.' “They would soon find something against you,” said he, `your letting me off would be enough. But I'll be damned if they shall injure you on my account.' He then called to the officer not to burn the house for he would surrender, and he resolutely walked out to them. `Damn you Murphy,' said the officer, `what a pretty scrape you have brought yourself into with these cursed croppies—you will get a sore back for it, I'll warrant you. But we must see whether the good codger within, has any hospitality for honest soldiers, as well as for deserters. Good morrow, Mr. Clements,' said he to me, coming into the house with a dozen of soldiers after him, `you have actly wisely. What a devil of a sin it would have been for you to have let the house be burned about these pretty chubby cheeked daughters of yours! What are you crying for,' said he to Nancy, “Ah sir!” said she, “I am afraid you will flog poor Murphy.” “He shall only be used as every cowardly deserter should be used, my pretty girl! But I am damned hungry. Come, Clements, let's have something to eat, for curse the morsel either I or my men have tasted since we left Carrickfergus. Come, my tender hearted little damsel! quit sobbing, and take pity on starving soldiers. Prepare us some of this bacon, with a few eggs and some bread and cheese, and a bottle or two of whiskey, to warm our stomachs, or, by G—d, we shall save you the trouble and do it ourselves.” F “Weel, Nancy, to gain their favour for poor Murphy, treated them as well as she could. At parting we all shook hands with him, but our hearts were heavy. He kissed Nancy, she wept like a child. “May God protect you,” said he, `it is likely we shall never meet again in this world!' And heaven knows they never did, nor never will. Even the officer himself was somewhat affected; and to do him justice, he treated us civilly enough, though he was a hard-hearted rascal in the main, for when they had left the house, as I followed them a little way, I heard him tell Murphy to prepare, for he had no mercy to expect!” “Perhaps,” said Edward, “the admonition might have been given to induce Murphy to a timely preparation for death. Under such circumstances, I think, I should wish at once to know my doom.” “By heaven! you are right,” cried the linen-seller, “I should like to know the worst that I might prepare for it. Death is bad enough; but it is soon over, but suspense is—is—confound me, if I know what to call it!—it is worse than death.” “It is lingering torment,” said Edward. “By George, you have it,” returned the linen-seller, “just what I wanted to call it. We must have another round for the gentleman's 'cuteness.” But before he could get once more applying the bruiser to the table, a woman entered the room with a face of inquiry. “Wull ony o' ye, gentlemen,” said she, “tell me how much six spinal and a half o' yarn comes to, at eleven pence ha'penny a hank?” “Wha gets your yarn? Nanny,” asked Clements. “Billy Boyd, sir.” “Has Billy ony wabs to sell the day, ken ye?” “I doubt na, sir, he has; though I canna tell for certain.” By this time the other linen dealer, who had suspended his attack upon the table, to calculate the amount of Nanny's yarn, told her that it came to one pound four shillings and eleven pence; and handed her the figures, marked with his pencil upon a piece of paper, with an air of conscious superiority in scholarship, that might have become any pedagogue philosopher in the country. He then invited her to take a dram; and asked her if she had any more yarn to sell. “No,” she replied, “but, I believe, my sin Jemmy's wife has twa or three spinal o' six hank yarn.” During this dialogue, Edward who wished to avoid the second bacchanalian attack which he saw contemplated, withdrew. He was soon followed by O'Halloran, who invited him to take a ramble through the streets in order to witness the humours of a Northern Irish yarn market. “The market,” said he, “in this town, is held once a month, and is generally attended by people from all parts of the country who wish to buy linen cloth or yarn, although, besides these articles, there are exposed for sale great numbers of cows and horses, and generally all kinds of merchandise, either the growth or manufacture of the country.” They had not gone far until Edward perceived the scene diversified by the tents of hawkers, erected on the sides of the streets, in which were vended a great variety of haberdashery, cutlery, &amp;c. Not far from these were stationed the humbler stalls of a species of travelling huxters called ginger-bread women, constructed either of old doors supported on the ends of barrels, or of two-wheeled cars leaning on supports of a similar description. Turning a corner near the market-house, he perceived to the left, a man elevated on a table selling waistcoat patterns and shawls by auction, and bawling lustily in order to attract customers. On the other side of the street, an old female ballad-singer exerted her lungs at a most powerful rate, in successful opposition to the auctioneer. The course jests of the one, and the ludicrous gestures of the other, were in complete rivalry. The ballad-singer, however, seemed to attract the greater attention, perhaps owing to her subject, which was of a political nature, giving an account of the trial, death, and heroism of the four militia men before noticed, who had been lately shot for treasonable practices, at Blarris-Moor, near Belfast. Of this elegiac composition of some of the rustic political bards, whose numerous effusions were then so prevalent and so eagerly sought after in the country, it may not be amiss to give the reader a few stanzas, as a specimen of those lyrical productions, which, although utterly destitute of the graces of fine writing, yet being adapted to popular airs, being in unison with the popular feelings, and containing sometimes a great deal of simplicity and nature, were altogether suited to the taste of the lower orders, and produced in their minds a wonderful degree of political enthusiasm. It has been asserted that the prevalence of those songs did more to increase the numbers of the conspirators than all the efforts of the French emissaries, or the writings and harangues of all the political philosophers, and age-of-reason men of the times. Some of the stanzas that now attracted the attention of Edward were as follows:— Ye Muse, grant me direction, To sing that foul transaction, Which causes sad reflection, Late done at Blarris-Moor, By wicked colonel Barber; Should I proceed much further, And call his conduct murder, 'Twere treason, I am sure! Belfast may well remember, When tyrants in their splendour, In all their power and grandeur, They hois'd them on a car; While infantry advancing, And cavalry were prancing, And glittering armour glancing, All in the pomp of war! They were of good behaviour, No heroes e'er were braver, But a perjured base deceiver, Betray'd their lives away. For the sake of golden store; The villain falsely swore; And the crime we now deplore, In sorrow and dismay. Amidst a hollow square, Well guarded front and rear, With guns and bayonets there, Their constancy to move. When they receiv'd their sentence, Their hearts felt no relentings; They bow'd to each acquaintance, And kneel'd to God above! Then their foes held consultation, To find out combination, And thus in exhortation, Curs'd Barber did propose: Arise from your devotion, Take pardon and promotion, Or death will be your portion, Unless you now disclose. Some moments then they mused, For their senses were confused, Then smiling they refused, And made him this reply:— We own we are united, Of death we're not affrighted, And hope to be requited, By him who rules on high. The guns were then presented, The balls their bosoms entered, While multitudes lamented The shocking sight to see F 2 Those youthful martyrs four, Lying weltering in their gore, And the plains besprinkled o'er, With the blood of cruelty. In coffins they were hurried, From Blarris-Moor were carried, And hastily were buried, While thousands, sunk in grief, Cried, “Granu! we much wonder, You rise not from your slumber, With voice as loud as thunder, To grant us some relief!” When Edward had listened to a few stanzas of this song, he perceived Dr. Farrel, his physician, approaching, who saluted him with great cordiality. Edward, who really esteemed this gentleman for his good sense and urbanity of manners, returned his salutation with unfeigned pleasure. The three gentlemen had not walked far together, until O'Halloran was taken aside by a square built, stout-looking man, in the habit of a traveller, who desired to converse with him in private. Edward and the doctor therefore walked on, while O'Halloran and the stranger went off in a different direction. Edward found in his new companion an inexhaustible mine of intelligence concerning the manners of the people of the North. “You see,” said he, “how open every man's countenance is; how ready every individual is to be civil. No matter how much he may be jostled in the crowd, he is willing to submit to the inconvenience, and to yield the way to his neighbour. This state of things, however, will only last for a few hours. Whiskey will soon overcome discretion, and you will then see this prudent, cautious people, who now seem so anxious to avoid giving offence, that they will not resent even real annoyances, taking fire at a look, and becoming ready to knock down every man who comes in their way!” A recruiting party of soldiers now passed them, for whom the crowd made way without seeming to pay them the slightest attention in any other respect. Far different was their deportment to a party of rope-dancers and equestrian performers, who next advanced, mounted on their well-taught steeds with trumpets sounding, and preceded by a Pickle Herring, whose antic grimaces and low jests excited frequent peals of laughter among the assembled multitude. It was with some difficulty that Edward and his companion kept their ground until this splendid and noisy procession had gone past; when, proceeding onwards, they came to the tent of an itinerant dealer in haberdashery, at the one end of which sat a group of well-dressed country girls. Edward immediately knew one of them to be his acquaintance, Peggy Caldwell; and while the doctor's attention was drawn to a fine, noble looking horse which a jockey was putting through his paces at some distance, he approached her. “Miss Caldwell,” said he, “I am glad to meet with you here. Is there any thing within this tent I can have the pleasure of bestowing upon you, in token of my gratitude for your attention to me during my confinement in your father's house?” “I believe, sir,” she replied, somewhat abashed, “it would be wrong in me to take any present from you.” “You will gratify me,” said Edward, in a persevering manner, “by receiving some gift—a new gown, or a new shawl, or any thing else you choose, as a testimony of my regard for you.” “Hold!” cried a loud determined voice behind him. “Gentle or simple, by G—d, you shant affront Miss Caldwell in my presence.” “Who are you?” demanded Edward, as he turned round, and beheld an active looking young fellow whose countenance indicated that he felt an offence, and was determined to resent it. “Who are you, who dares address me so rudely in the public street?” “As to that,” said the other, “I will let you feel wha I am, gin you dare to affront that young woman again in my hearin. She's no o' the kind you tak her to be.” “I am as incapable of insulting that young woman as you, or any other of her friends can be,” returned Edward, “but I am capable and determined to punish any unprovoked rudeness that may be offered to myself.” Peggy here interfered, and explained to the young man that the gentleman had not offended her; that he was the person whom Mr. O'Halloran had saved from drowning, and on whom she had attended when he was confined in her father's house. The doctor now advanced, for he had overheard part of the altercation. “What is the matter? Jemmy,” said he to the young man. “Naething,” replied Jemmy, “I see I mistook the thing; and I beg the gentleman's pardon. I was owre hasty. But I hope his honour an' you will oblige me, by comin' wi' Peggy and these ither lasses, to tak share o' half a pint, an mak' up the matter.” “Since your acknowledgment is as candid as your attack was unprovoked,” said Edward, “I shall drink to our reconciliation; but it shall be only on condition that Peggy previously receives from me some donation, as I before proposed, and you yourself may choose it for her.” A silk shawl, alternately striped with green, white, and red, an arrangement of colours then much affected by the United Irishmen, was accordingly purchased for Peggy, and the party immediately retired into the next public house, every room of which was so completely filled with people, that they could scarcely find seats. “What a terrible consumption of ardent spirits,” thought Edward as he seated himself, “must take place in the markets and fairs of this part of the country! No bargain, it appears, can be concluded, nor any offence atoned for, without the interference of this enemy to human happiness.” While he thus meditated, Jemmy Hunter seated himself beside him, and in a low whisper, said, “Ye maun ken, sir, that Peggy an' me are sweet-hearts. I like her sae weel that I canna see ony body else lookin' at her, without taking it amiss. Besides, ye maun grant that it was na very creditable for a poor bonny lass, like her, to be ta'en notice to by a rich lookin' gentleman sa far abune her, in the market. I hope ye wanna be offended at me, as I did na ken that you only wanted to pay a debt o' frien'ship.” “Your motive, I perceive,” replied Edward, “was good; and not being acquainted with the etiquette of this part of the country on such occasions, I may have done wrong. On these accounts, I assure you, I entirely forgive the harshness of your conduct; but, could this explanation not have taken place, without accompanying it with such a useless ceremony as whiskey drinking?” “Na, na, sir, by my troth, we'll ha' nae dry reconcilements. Besides ye maun ken (whispering close into Edward's ear,) I wanted to treat the lassie hersel to a dram. It mak's courtin' sweet on market days.” Edward having no argument to oppose to this last remark, gave a smile, and nodded in acquiescence to the propriety of Jemmy's method of courting. When the company in various parts of the room began to grow noisy, which, as the country people had now commenced setting themselves thoroughly to their cups, was soon the case, Edward and the doctor thought proper to withdraw. On reaching the street, they perceived a great commotion among the crowd; the people running all in one direction. They soon understood that a quarrel had taken place between two drunken fellows; and observed that the men were running pell-mell either to gratify curiosity, or to see fair play, while the women were hurrying fearlessly forward to separate and pacify the combatants. The combatants, at length, were seen belabouring each other heartily with large sticks, whenever the crowd permitted them to approach near enough. Their immediate friends, at last, coming upon the scene, they were carried away in different directions, streaming with blood, and each uttering the most terrible imprecations, not so much against his antagonist as against those who had interfered to prevent a longer continuance of the affray. Edward was persuaded that the assistance of his medical friend would have been immediately required by some one of the parties; but the doctor assured him that he expected no such thing. “Such quarrels,” said he, “generally produce only black eyes, or a few bruises about the head, for which the people who engage in them care so little that they scarcely ever drink a single gill the less on account of them. Formerly these fights occasioned considerable animosity between the families related to the parties. At present this is not the case. As soon as sobriety returns, the combatants forget their rage, shake hands, drink a few gills more in token of friendship, and in the height of their conviviality, perhaps again dispute, and try the strength of each other's sculls with renewed fierceness and animosity. If, indeed, the dispute be of a religious or political nature, it often assumes a more malignant character, and involves numbers in its consequences. Often pitched battles are appointed, and actually fought by the contending factions, when the civil power has to interfere for their suppression. In these threatening times, the military are frequently called out in aid of the constables, in order to preserve the peace, which otherwise it would be impossible to effect.” At this moment, a guard of soldiers was seen approaching, commanded by their lieutenant, but under the direction of the high constable of the town. Having dispersed the crowd, which the late fight had collected, they entered every public house to ascertain if all was quiet, while the constable left strict injunctions upon each landlord to entertain no company later than nine o'clock that evening, on pain of being subjected to the penalty for keeping an irregular house, which the late law, adapted to the troublesome nature of the times rendered very severe upon publicans.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. V. Light care had he for life, and less for fame. But not less fitted for the desperate game; He deemed himself marked out for others hate, And mocked at ruin so they shared his fate. What car'd he for the freedom of the crowd, He raised the humble but to bend the proud. Inured to hunters, he was found at bay, And they must kill, they cannot spare the prey. In voice, mein, gesture, savage nature spoke, And from his eye the gladiator broke. Byron. The doctor being called away on some business, Edward returned to the inn where his servant staid. Here he found O'Halloran and the stranger who had some hours before taken him aside on the street. They were sitting, one at each end of a table, in an angle of a tolerably large room, which, like every other in the house at that juncture, was quite full of people enjoying the convivial cup with great noise and good humour. Edward observed that his friend and the stranger were the two most silent people in the room, and he was surprised to find that O'Halloran, although he was evidently on an intimate footing with the stranger, never named him. The latter was wrapped in a great coat, booted and spurred, and held in his hand a huge horseman's whip, heavily loaded with lead. He appeared to be about forty years of age, slightly pockpitted, very muscular, and broad shouldered, fully five feet ten inches high, with small gray eyes and heavy eyebrows. There was something very daring and at the same time very gloomy in his countenance. He sat with his back to the wall seemingly abstracted in deep meditation, with his hat drawn forward over his face, so as partly to conceal it. O'Halloran appeared also to be rather in a thoughtful mood, although there was something of satisfaction visible in his countenance. He was proposing to Edward to return home, when the attention of the company was attracted by the arrival of two dragoons at the door of the inn, with intelligence of an alarming nature from Belfast. They gave an account of the assassination of one M`Bride, an informer, which had taken place in that town, the preceding evening, by means, it was conjectured, of an air-gun, no report having been heard, although the deceased was shot dead on the spot. They produced some printed handbills describing the persons of the supposed perpetrators, and offering a reward of five hundred pounds, for the apprehension of each. They said, that parties of the military had been dispatched in all directions, in search of them, and that they had come on the northern route for that purpose. The whole Inn now became a scene of confusion, occasioned by the multitude rushing in to obtain particular information of the affair. This confusion continued until the arrival of George M`Claverty, Esq. the principal acting magistrate of the neighbourhood. He stationed some soldiers to guard the doors, until he should examine every suspicious person in the house, and compare him with the descriptions in the hand-bills. The stranger had disappeared on the first arrival of the horsemen. Edward, therefore, was almost the only person in the house totally unknown to the magistrate. He was accordingly very particular in scrutinizing him. The first description was read. “Five feet ten inches”—that was nearly Edward's height—“Firm made and very muscular,” he was the former but not the latter. Still so far it might G do—“Slightly pock-pitted”—Edward had only one or two traces of the small-pox.—“Full-chested”— he was portly enough in his appearance. All this might answer.—“Forty years of age”—Here the description was totally out. Edward did not appear to be much above twenty.—“Reddish, straight hair”—Here the application altogether failed. Edward's hair was black, and somewhat curled. “Well!” said the magistrate, “let us see the other description.”—“Five feet high”—“That wont do.” —“Stoop shouldered”—“That wont do either. —Young man, what is your name?” “Middleton, sir.” “Where do you come from?” “From the neighbourhood of Dublin.” “A damned seditious neighbourhood! What is your business in the North?” “Curiosity, sir.” “A damned suspicious employment! Is there any one here who knows you?” “Mr. O'Halloran, sir.” “A damned suspicious—I was going to say seditious acquaintance—Mr. O'Halloran, I beg your pardon. Although as yet we have no information against you sufficient to warrant your committal, we have heard enough to render you suspected. I am sorry for it, as I know you are, in other respects, a worthy enough character.” “I thank you,” said O'Halloran, “for your favorable opinion. As to this gentleman, if my report in his behalf will not be taken, perhaps that of Doctor Farrell will.” “If Doctor Farrel says that he is a true man,” replied the magistrate, “I will immediately crack a bottle of wine with him to his majesty's health, and you will join us, I hope, Mr. O'Halloran. The king has not a better subject in his dominions than the Doctor.” The Doctor soon made his appearance, and having declared his opinion in favour of Edward's loyalty, the wine was introduced by the magistrate's order. Edward immediately filled a glass to the king's health, and drinking it started to his feet. “Mr. M`Claverty,” said he, “you are an entire stranger to me, and I now find you on important official duty, enquiring after the perpetrators of a shocking murder. These circumstances amply excuse if they do not quite justify the manner in which you have accosted me. Were it otherwise, no man with impunity should have made insinuations of my being either an assassin or a rebel. I will not obstruct you in the doing of your duty, nor take offence at being exposed to an examination to which my being a stranger under the present circumstances, rendered me sufficiently liable. If you have done with your interrogatories, however, I shall now, if Mr. O'Halloran accompanies me, withdraw. Should you want me at any time within the space of eight days, you shall find me either at this inn or at my friend's castle.” He then retired with O'Halloran, and immediately ordered out their horses. While they were getting ready, Tom Mullins took Edward aside, with a face of great importance. “Master,” said he, “I want to ask your honour, would it be right to be made a croppy? Here is a very good friend of mine, they call Tom Darragh, who says it will make a man of me; and that every true Irishman ought to be united. By Jasus, said l, I am an Irishman, every drop of my blood; but if my master, who knows every thing better than I do—which you know you do, your honour—says I shouldn't, then I think I may still belong to my own country without being united.” “Tom!” said Edward, “I desire you not to converse with any of the people you suspect to be united, especially if they attempt to seduce you into their confederacy. It would be next thing to becoming a rebel to join them.” “And haven't you been put up, master?” “Mullins,” demanded Edward rather angrily, “has any one had the audacity to tell you so?” “Why, sure, sir, didn't Darragh himself, who says he knows all about these matters, tell me so not two hours ago. He said he could swear that the old gentleman you came here with had done it. Well, said I, if you can swear that, I'll be put up too. So we got a pint of whiskey, and when we had drunk a couple of rounds to old Ireland and St. Patrick, he went away to get a bible, and was bidding me stand on my feet to take the oath, when the horsemen came, and we both ran to the door to see what the crowd meant.” “So you have not yet taken the oath?” said Edward. “No, sir; and it just came into my head when I saw you here that I would ask your honour about it, for I thought that if you were up yourself you would know whether there was any good in it.” “I am not up, as you call it,” said Edward. “I am no United Irishman; and, hear me, Tom, the moment I know you to be one, I shall dismiss you from my service.” “Arrah, master, don't be angry; for if it displeases you, I wont take the oath for one of them.” After a few more cautions on the subject, and also with regard to secrecy concerning himself, Edward left Tom, and set off with O'Halloran for the castle. He was anxious to hasten his friend's departure from the town, lest his obnoxious politics, and his imprudent warmth, might betray him into some difficulties. On their way, they called at the post office, and received the newspapers, which had just arrived. They then rode on in silence, until they were nearly a mile from town, when Edward observed, that the market scenes were very amusing; but that, in this instance, any satisfaction he had experienced was more than counterbalanced by the unpleasant intelligence of the horrible murder that had been committed in Belfast. “Sir!” said O'Halloran, “killing for self preservation is surely no murder; and it was certainly meritorious to destroy a traitor whose longer existence would have been the destruction of hundreds.” “No man can plead self-defence,” replied Edward, “unless he be personally attacked, which does not appear to have been the case with the perpetrators of this action; and deliberate assassination, in cold blood, even when the most abandoned and dangerous character is the victim, carries with it something so abhorrent to my feelings, and so contrary to all my ideas of morality, that I do not see how it can be justified, even on the supposition of it being intended to prevent occurrences by which others might eventually suffer.” “Your laws,” said O'Halloran, “may acknowledge the propriety of self-defence only in repelling a personal attack; but your laws in this, as in many other cases are erroneous guides by which to estimate the morality or immorality of an action. Nature directs us better. She tells us that, by every means in our power, we should frustrate the machinations of our enemies and prevent impending evils from falling upon us by the destruction, either publicly or privately, of those who would inflict them.” “The establishment of such a doctrine,” replied Edward, “as the propriety of privately destroying our enemies, would abolish all security of personal G 2 safety, which is one of the chief advantages enjoyed from governments and laws. Each individual would be constituted the sole judge of whether he is threatened with sufficient danger to warrant the destruction of his neighbour, and malice or interest would seldom fail to aggravate the slightest injury into a sanction for murder. Hence the flood-gates of all the malignant passions that generate perpetual strife and blood-shed, would be opened upon society.” At this moment the stranger who had engrossed so much of O'Halloran's company during the day, galloped down a lane from a farm-house, and joined them on the road. Edward had observed this man leaving the inn very hastily the instant the dragoons were announced. This circumstance had excited a vague suspicion that he might be one of the assassins. This suspicion almost arose to a certainty, when he read the first description, that the magistrate had attempted to apply to himself. On his approach now, Edward was more particular in observing him, and was forcibly struck with the exact correspondence of his person with the description in all its traits. He made a bow to Edward, which he returned coolly, for his soul shuddered at the idea of being in company with a murderer. “M`Cauley,” said O'Halloran, “the minions of government are now on the alert to discover those brave fellows, who have avenged their country, and saved upwards of two hundred of her patriots from the gallows, by the destruction of the perjured M`Bride. Their suspicion falls upon every stranger, and they were likely, before we left town, to give some trouble to this gentleman. “I suppose,” said M`Cauley, “your magistrate, M`Claverty, is very zealous on this occasion. But it may yet be so much the worse for him.” No reply was made, and silence continued until they were within a mile of the castle. M`Cauley then stopped suddenly. “Mr. O'Halloran,” said he, looking at the same time earnestly in Edward's face, for the whole three had stopped, “if I may judge from appearance, your friend here, possesses too much honour to betray a man who reposes so much confidence in him as to entrust him with his life.” O'Halloran replied, “that he had every reliance on Edward's honour, but—” “No buts,” said the other, “if he is a man of honour, he shall know who I am, let his views of my conduct be what they may. Young man,” continued he, addressing Edward, “you see before you, one whose whole heart and soul is devoted to his country; and, who to avenge her cause upon a traitor, has not scrupled to offend human laws past forgiveness; and, perhaps, in the opinion of many good men, has also violated the laws of heaven. Of this, however, he can assure you, his own conscience applauds the deed. Conviction tells him he has done his duty. He has not only prevented the lives of more than two hundred patriots from falling into the hands of tyrants who know no mercy; he has also prevented his country's enemies from becoming acquainted with the efforts her sons are making to free her from bondage. Sir, you may condemn my action. I have destroyed an enemy to my country, who had sworn to be her friend; but you must respect my motives; they were purely patriotic. I am not blood-thirsty; but in competition with my country's welfare, I value neither my own blood nor that of any other man. In short, I have destroyed M`Bride, the informer, before he got his traitorous designs accomplished, and should the gallows be my reward, I shall there glory in the deed.” The magnanimity of M`Cauley made a strong impression on Edward. He deplored his infatuation, he condemned his crime, but he admired his devoted fidelity to the cause he had espoused. He assured him, “that although he would rather not have been entrusted with his secret, he should have no cause to repent the confidence he had placed in him.” O'Halloran's countenance brightened at this assurance, and with more than usual spirits he led the way to the castle. On entering, Edward was introduced to an inmate of the castle whom he had not before seen. This was the only sister of O'Halloran, who had been some weeks absent, and had just returned a few hours before, accompanied by a Miss Agnew, at whose father's house she had been visiting. The old lady was remarkably intelligent, active and cheerful for her time of life. She was older than her brother; and might now be about her sixty-fifth year. At the early period of her life she enjoyed the sweets of matrimony for about five years; but her husband who was an extensive merchant in Belfast, was drowned in a voyage to Liverpool. His name was Brown, and, although they never had children, they were tenderly attached to each other. Indeed, so fondly did Mrs. Brown cherish the memory of her beloved husband, who had been her first and favourite lover, that she would never after his death listen to the addresses of any man. Miss Agnew was a pretty, lively, rosy-cheeked girl of nineteen, who had lately finished a boarding school education, and possessed an easy, gay sort of familiarity in her manner, which was far from displeasing. She was, occasionally, fond of indulging in a sportive kind of wit approaching to what is vulgarly termed quizzing. This, however, if we except a little coquetry, which was natural to her, was her only foible, for she was in reality a well informed and well bred handsome girl, with a fortune of five thousand pounds at her own disposal, bequeathed to her several years before by a deceased uncle. This accession to the castle party was highly pleasing to Edward, as it promised not only to be the means of preventing politics from engrossing the conversation, but of affording him more of Ellen's society, who would not be so shy of her company when it would be only sought for in the presence of her female friends. After dinner the newspapers were produced. On opening the Bolfast News-Letter, O'Halloran read aloud the following paragraph:— “Barbarous Assassination.—Yesterday evening a shocking murder was committed in North Street, in this town. A respectable man named M`Bride, was shot dead at the mouth of Round Entry by some villains who had stationed themselves there for that purpose. It is supposed that the instrument used was an air-gun, as no report was heard at the time that the deed was done. Favoured by the confusion which took place the villains escaped, it is supposed, up the Entry, and have hitherto eluded pursuit. Two men, namely M`Cauley, and Kelly, were observed standing about the mouth of the Entry for some time previous to the commission of the crime; and are suspected. Descriptions of their persons are given in an advertisement in another part of our paper, where it will also be seen that a reward of five hundred pounds is offered for the apprehension of each. It is suspected that they belong to the society of United Irishmen; and that to prevent an exposure of the designs of that association, which it is thought the deceased intended to make to government, was the motive that urged these wicked and misguided wretches to the perpetration of the foulest and blackest crime of which men can be guilty.” “The editor of this paper,” said O'Halloran, when he had finished reading the paragraph, “has always been a tool to the government. But let us see what the Northern Star says on the subject. The conductors of that paper are true Irishmen, men of enlightened minds and independent spirits, who cannot be bought.” “A warning to traitors.—Yesterday evening an awful but just dispensation was inflicted upon the notorious M`Bride, for an unprincipled conspiracy with some Orange magistrates to betray the cause of his country, in violation of the most solemn oaths. We are informed that this unhappy man had professed great zeal in the cause of the United Irishmen, and had consequently enjoyed a great share of their confidence. It appears, however, that this zeal was affected for the purpose of treachery. His intentions to betray the leaders of the Union into the hands of government, it is said, were only of late discovered, but discovered in such a manner as to leave no doubt on the subject. On his way to the stage office where he intended to take the coach for Dublin in order to give his information to the ministry, he was shot at the mouth of Round Entry in North-street. “We are no friends to assassination or any other mode of destroying human life, but when the circumstances, that those who were concerned in this action, had either to do it or suffer themselves, is considered, it is hoped that the public, if they cannot altogether justify, will at least be ready to pardon them. Those at least who so loudly eulogized the destroyer of Marat, cannot with any consistency, condemn the destroyers of M`Bride. We trust that the fate of this unfortunate man will be a caution to all who would betray their country, for it demonstrates that the people have energy and promptitude sufficient to baffle the attempts of treachery, and to inflict vengeance on their enemies.” The reading of these paragraphs made an impression of deep horror on the minds of the ladies, and when O'Halloran had finished, Mrs. Brown remarked with a sigh, that the state of society must be dreadful when even its most virtuous and enlightened members, were found ready to exert their eloquence in palliating the most terrible of crimes. “Ah! my brother!” she exclaimed, preventing him from interrupting her, “I know that you would plead necessity and self-preservation. But necessity is an old apology, and is always a dreadful one; and self-preservation, valuable as it is, is surely bought at a dear price, when assassination is paid for it.” “Sister,” said O'Halloran, “we shall not at present contend this matter. The deed is done, and I hope that God will bless it, as he did the slaying of Eglon by the patriot Ehud.” He then arose, and requesting M`Cauley to accompany him, they withdrew together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. VI. What though no gaudy titles grace my birth, Titles the servile courtier's lean reward, Sometimes the pay of virtue, but more oft The hire which greatness gives to sycophants, Yet Heaven has made me honest, made me more Than e'er a king did when he made a lord. —Rowe. “Poor man!” said Mrs. Brown, when her brother had retired, “Ireland had never a warmer friend; and if his power was equal to his wishes, there would not be an unhappy individual within the limits of her four provinces. Mr. Middleton, I do not know your political sentiments, but I shall have no hesitation in telling you mine. I wish earnestly for the peace and prosperity of my country, without respect to her form of government, and have no objection to live under the protection of the British constitution, except when that protection degenerates into oppression, which, to our fatal experience, we find that it frequently does.” “Madam,” replied Edward, “if you can only answer me one question in the affirmative, I shall be happy to find my opinion on these matters corroborated, and sanctioned by yours. Do you not think that conspiracy, treason, and civil war, not to speak of midnight burnings, and assassinations, are injudicious and unjustifiable methods of correcting the misgovernment, which we all acknowledge to have but too much prevailed of late years in this country?” “I do,” was the reply. “Then we agree,” said Edward. “Since that is the case,” said Miss Agnew, “we have no occasion to talk more on this horrible subject. I never hear it discussed, but it throws me into the vapours; and absolutely that dreadful story from Belfast, has depressed my spirits so terribly to-night, that I shall not be able to recover them this month. Suppose Ellen gives us a song; perhaps it may do me good. Let us have one of Mr. M`Nelvin's, and I'll try to touch the tune on the Piano.” As her aunt and Edward joined in this request, Ellen complied, remarking that, “as she was not in good enough spirits to give them an air sufficiently lively to counteract the disorder of which Miss Agnew complained, she would sing them some verses which were lately put into her hands by a friend of hers, who had once been an exile from his native country, and who to relieve the pain of absence from all he loved, had frequently recourse to the consolations of the muse.” SONG. Oft as by fair Ohio's side, I court the solitary scene; Of hoary forests spreading wide, Or prairies waving fresh and green; From musing on the evening ray That gilds the glittering landscape o'er, On fancy's wings I fly away, To Erin's sea-encircled shore. There on the primrose covered vale, By natal Inver's hallowed stream; Once more I breathe the scented gale, That oft refreshed my childhood's dream: And sweet in many a tuneful lay, I hear the warblers of the grove, Where once as blithe in song as they, I poured the rural strains of love. In that fair hawthorn-skirted plain, Where youthful pleasures first I knew; I meet my long-lost friends again, For ever loved, for ever true: H And, oh! while rapture uncontroul'd, Bright glistens in their ardent eyes, I to my glowing breast enfold The partners of my early joys. Fair visions of celestial hue! O! still possess with kindly spell, This aching heart, which but for you, Might bid all earthly joys farewell. From warm affection's source divine, Your ever blissful charms arise; Oh! let that throb be ever mine, Your rapture-giving smile supplies. “I am still melancholy,” said Miss Agnew, drawing a long sigh when Ellen had done singing, “I am still melancholy, but it is now a melancholy of a sweeter nature than I felt before. Oh! how pleasant it would have been to have wandered on the banks of the Ohio with your poet, when he produced those verses! But pray, dear, wont you tell us who is the author?” “He is a man,” replied Ellen, “whose present station in the world almost approaches that of a mendicant.” “A very poetical station, truly!” said Miss Agnew. “But although,” continued Ellen, “he has the garb, he never exhibits the meanness of a beggar.” “That is still more poetical,” said Mrs. Brown. “And although” Ellen again continued, “he has now the gravity and wisdom of sixty, he possesses all the warm-heartedness and enthusiastic benevolence of twenty.” “That is most poetical of all,” said Edward. “This person” resumed Ellen, “whom you have all pronounced to be so poetical, is no other than our Recluse, old Saunders.” “I shall visit him to-morrow,” said Miss Agnew, for I wont be easy till I pay my respects to his bardship.” “But hush!” cried Mrs. Brown, “who is you? Hah! it is Peg Dornan's coarse voice.” “Is the bonny young Dublin gentleman within?” was vociferated from the brazen lungs of Peg, to a servant in the hall. “He is. What do you want with him?” was demanded. “I want to see himsel. I'll tell my errand to nae body else. An'l maun see him soon, whare'er he be.” Edward went immediately to the hall. “What is the matter, Peg?” said he. “Come awa', sir, wi' me and ye'll ken a' about it, belyve.” He followed her without hesitation till they came near to the mysterious rock, from which he first saw Ellen and her grandfather. “They're gaen in noo,” said Peg, “but when they come oot they'll, maybe, talk o't again. Ye maun wait here, gin you want to hear them; an' it concerns you nearly. I'll awa', but lie ye doon amang thir bushes, and watch them, they'll come close this way.” He had not lain long, until M`Cauley and a stranger appeared advancing from the rock. When they approached within a few yards of him, at a place where two paths crossed each other, they stopped. “Tell me before we part,” said the stranger to M`Cauley, “what is your intention with respect to this young man to whom you so foolishly entrusted your secret. If he refuses to take the oath, I advise you to despatch him, for dead men tell no tales.” “I shall be guided by O'Halloran respecting him,” answered M`Cauley. “O'Halloran is too womanish-hearted, to give good advice in this case.” “His advice I shall, nevertheless, abide by. The disclosure was voluntary on my part, and unsolicited by the young man; and I am much deceived, if I cannot confide in his honour, which is already pledged to me, almost as firmly as in his oath.” “Trust no man's honour in these times,” said the other. “Happy would it be for our United confederacy, if we had trusted even fewer oaths than we have done. Government would not then have been so well prepared to give us a warm reception, whenever we shall attack it. But here comes O'Halloran himself.” The matter being referred to O'Halloran, he exclaimed with energy. “Sooner than a hair of his head shall fall, whether he join us or not, you shall pierce me to the heart. He is my guest, and my friend; and I shall protect him as such. Darragh, let us hear no more of this detestable proposal. It makes me shudder to think of it. Such atrocities only tend to weaken the best of causes. If frequently committed by our party, all virtuous and feeling men will think themselves contaminated by our connexion.” “You are right,” said M'Cauley, “and the first man that raises a hand against Mr. Middleton, makes me his enemy.” “You may act as you please,” said Darragh, “but I foretel that this fellow will yet make you repent your present forbearance. He must be a damned orangeman in his heart. I could have made his servant a United Irishman to-day, but for his cursed interference; and now the fellow knows that I am one, and no doubt will be ready to inform on me; but, by G—d, before to-morrow night, I'll make the rascal unfit to tell stories.” “I beseech you,” said O'Halloran, “not to be so rash. The poor fellow can be easily persuaded that you intended nothing but sport with him.” “Avast,” said Darragh, “that wont do. If he swears to the facts as they took place, an orange jury and a pensioned judge, will never consider whether I was in sport or in earnest.” He broke short the conversation by bidding them good night, in a rather surly tone, and walked off towards the town. O'Halloran and M`Cauley moved towards the rock, and Edward, on whose mind, it will be supposed, the conversation had made a deep impression, returned to the castle. Before he reached it, however, Peg Dornan overtook him. “Weel, sir, did you hear aucht you did na' like?” “Too much, Peg; but how came you to know any thing about it?” “Why, sir, gin you'll no be in a hurry, I'll tell you,” (for Edward's perturbation of mind made him walk very fast,) “just as I was sauntering alang the shore, about an hour syne, I saw Tam Darragh, and anither doure-looking chiel they ca' M`Cauley, walking tegither—an' no' wishing to be seen by them, I lay doon amang the bushes, an' they cam' quite close to me, an' said, the tain to the tither, that's Darragh said to M`Cauley, that chap at the castle maun be an orangeman, an' will, as sure as death, tell your secret. You maun shoot him, or tak' him aff some ither way, gin you want to be safe yoursel.' `What! thought I, are they gaun to kill my bonny Mr. Middleton? De'il be in my tongue, but I'll tell him every word o't. But I thoucht you would na' be likely to credit sitch an unfeasible story; so I fancied it better to gie you a chance o' hearin' about it yoursel, an' gin you should na' happen to hear it, I would then tell you. Guid nicht, an' tak' care o' yoursel, my bonny lad, for they're no' canny cheils ye heard talkin'.” Edward desired her to communicate the affair to no one else; and thanking her for her timely information, he gave her half a guinea, and hastened H 2 to the castle. Just as he entered the avenne, he perceived old Saunders coming out of the gate, and not having come to any determination how to act, he thought it would be proper to consult the old man, in whose prudence he had every reason to confide. He accordingly communicated to him, the present aspect of his affairs, adding, that with respect to his own safety, he was under no concern; but how to protect his servant from the malice of Darragh, without informing upon the latter, and having him arrested, a measure to which he had the utmost aversion, gave him a great deal of perplexity. The Recluse, after a few moments reflection, replied. “Fear nothing for your servant. I shall undertake for his safety.” He then desired Edward to accompany him to William Caldwell's, where they found young Hunter, with Peggy and one of her brothers, just returned from the market. The old man requested Jemmy to go with him and Edward to the glen. On arriving there, he communicated to him the danger in which Tom Mullins then stood, and asked him if he would be willing to render Edward a service, by rescuing him from it. The generous youth, rejoiced at the office assigned him. “That I will!” said he, seizing Edward by the hand, “I'll stand by him, and if Tam Darragh, or ony bluid-thirsty rascal like him, ventures to lay a finger's end on him, he'll find whether his bones or mine be the hardest. I ha' been made a United Irishman, but I was na' made yin to stan' by an' see my frien's murdered.” “But you must go quietly about this business,” said old Saunders, “we do not wish it to be made public. You know if the kingsmen were to be informed of it, they would soon sift the matter, and bring a great many more than the guilty into trouble.” “Just tell me what I maun do, an' I'll follow your directions to a hair's breadth,” said Hunter. “You will go without delay,” returned the Recluse, “with a letter from Mr. Middleton to his servant, which will contain an order for him to obey you in every particular. But first you must make haste and saddle your best riding horse, and return here with him as soon as possible. By that time we shall have written instructions prepared for you.” In about half an hour, Hunter returned gallantly mounted on a prancing steed, as boldly determined to sally forth in defence of innocence, as ever any knight of chivalry was in the days of romance. Edward gave him a letter for Tom Mullins, and the Recluse a packet of sealed instructions, which he was desired not to open until he should convey Mullins as far as Antrim, about eighteen miles from Larne. He was desired not to set out in the night, lest Darragh should suspect his designs to be discovered, and thereby be rendered more rancorous and inveterate in his resolution to destroy Mullins; but he was ordered to keep a watchful eye on the motions of the former, until the latter should be out of his reach. Having received these instructions, he clapped spurs to his horse, and with a light heart and a determined spirit, set swiftly forward on his benevolent errand. He rode so fast that he overtook Darragh who was on foot near the entrance of the town. “What's the matter, Hunter,” said Darragh, “that you ride so fast to town at such a late hour?” “Naething, Tam,” replied the other, “but I had to tak' some lasses hame frae the market, and I thoucht I would come back an' see some mair o' the fun, an' gin you ha' naething better to do, we'll ha' a naggin together.” In pursuance of this worthy resolution, they rapped at the door of the first public house they came to, which they found locked, although there was light enough to be seen, and noise enough to be heard from within, to assure them that the inmates had still sufficient employment to keep them out of bed for some time. “Who is there?” was demanded by the landlord. “A friend!” replied Darragh. “Is it you, Tam,” cried the other? “It is scarcely ten minutes since the soldiers have cleared the house, though I have let in some neighbours by the back way since that. Who is with you?” “Nobody, but young Jemmy Hunter; you know Jemmy.” “If you go round behind the house, I'll let you into a back room, and blind the shutters. You'll make as little noise as you can, and take care that nobody sees you.” They followed his directions, and were soon seated with a fuming jug of hot punch before them. “Jemmy, you have been put up lately, I'm told,” said Darragh. “That was right, man. Give me your hand. I wish every stout fellow in the country was united—we would then show the tyrants that we are as good as they are, for all so much as they despise us. But I'm afraid we'll never get one half of the country united; though if I had my way, it would soon be another story, for those who would not join us from love, I would compel to join us from fear!” “Na, Tam, that would na do either,” replied Jemmy, “for it would make a great many ill-wishers to the cause join it; and they would be likely to do it mair harm than guid.” “I would prevent them from betraying us, at least,” said Darragh, “by making a few examples of informers. But Jemmy, I must tell that I am myself likely to be informed on by an Up-the-country, silly fellow that I wanted to swear in this morning. He is servant to a cursed kingsman, that I thought Mr. O'Halloran had put up, but I was damnably mistaken; for when the stupid dog of a servant went to consult him about the business, he threatened him within an inch of his life, if he would take the oath. So that after exposing myself to the rascal, I could make nothing of him; and if the blockhead should take it into his head to inform against me, you know my life would not be worth a damn. But I'll run no risks, I'll send the dog to Lucifer, before I sleep, or my name is not Tom Darragh.” “Surely, Tam,” said Hunter, “you would na be sa rash; the man has done na harm yet.” “Nor, by G—d,” exclaimed the other, “shall it be long in his power to do harm.” “Hoot man! dinna talk this way; its no safe for me to hear you; you may tak' it into your head to kill me for fear I should tell that you killed him.” “I can trust you, Jemmy; you know that it is in the guid cause; and you have sworn not to betray it.” “I never swore not to discover murder if I kend o't;” replied Hunter with spirit; “I'll keep ony secret you like but that: And when the United Irishmen want my help, I'll be ready with as guid a musket as ony in the parish to tak' the field. But Tam, tak' my advice; be a little moderate. You can keep close, ye ken, if you're afeared. But let us hae na mair killing in cauld bluid—we'll hae plenty o't in warm, I'll warrant you, when the time comes.” To these remarks, Darragh made no reply; but sat for some minutes in a rather thoughtful and sulky humour. At last he took Hunter by the hand, told him he believed him to be an honest fellow, that, perhaps, he might take his advice; but that happen what would, he was sure he would not injure him. Hunter reflecting that he himself was commissioned to prevent the threatened crime from taking place, and conceiving that it was in his power to do so, assured him that he would not inform upon him, for any thing that should happen. They then drank another gill sociably together; and retiring from the house by the way they entered it, separated in the street with expressions of mutual good will and confidence. Hunter now proceeded to the Antrim Arms, and procured admission by mentioning the letter he had to deliver to Mullins. He informed the landlord that he should lodge with him all night. “In the meantime,” said he, “let this up-the-country frien' o' mine an' me, hae a jug o' punch in a room by oursels, for I hae some cracks for his ain ear.” The landlord obeyed, and in a moment Jemmy had another fuming pitcher at his side. This important matter being adjusted, he produced Edward's letter, and desired Tom to be ready for a journey by day-break. In a short time they retired to rest without Hunter having informed him of the designs of Darragh. In the morning they both rose with the dawn, and, while Hunter went to discharge the landlord's bill, Mullins hastened to prepare the horses. He was not long in the stable until two men presented themselves before him, one holding a pistol and the other a bible to his breast. “Swear,” said Darragh, who held the pistol, “that you will never inform any one that I wanted to make you a United Irishman, or you are, this instant, a dead man!” “I will swear any thing, fairly,” said Mullins, petrified with astonishment, “but, dear gentlemen, only give me time to bless myself.” “We have no time to talk with you,” exclaimed Darragh, “we must be gone, swear this instant, or be shot and damned!” and he raised his arm as if to perform the deed he threatened, when that arm was seized by Hunter, who hearing the last words of the threat, sprung upon him with the force and agility of a lion upon his prey, and threw him upon his back on the ground. The pistol went off in the struggle, and grazing the arm of the man who held the bible, lodged itself in the wall of the stable. “By Jasus, he can't hurt me now,” cried Mullins—“so you too shall lie down in the dirt with your comrade, my jewel.” So saying, he struck the poor bible holder such a blow as almost fractured his lower jaw, and fairly prostrated him alongside his companion, while the blood gushed like a torrent from his mouth and nostrils. The noise soon brought the landlord to the spot, who, on hearing Mullins' statement of the case, would have secured Darragh and his companion, in order to have them carried before a magistrate; but Hunter opposed this, representing it as a political quarrel of which the government might make a great handle, and that, at all events, no good could result to either party by its prosecution. On Mullins, therefore, declaring that he wished for no further revenge, it was agreed to hush the matter on condition that Darragh should swear never again to make an attempt on Mullin's life, a condition with which he, in a very surly manner, complied. When this was done he could not, however, disguise the strongly-excited malignity of his passions, and, casting a fierce look at Hunter, “I shall yet be revenged,” he ejaculated. “May God forgive you!” said the good natured youth, who had heard him. “When your anger cools, I'm sure you'll no' say so.” The victors now set off in conformity to the Recluse's instructions; but they had not gone far before Hunter reflected that an account of the morning's transactions might induce his employers to change their intentions with respect to Mullins, especially as Darragh was now under the obligation of a solemn oath not to molest him. He, therefore, thought it prudent to convey Mullins to the Recluse's cavern in order to receive further instructions. On arriving there, Hunter hastened to the castle for Edward, who, on coming to the cavern and learning the state of affairs, declared to the Recluse his opinion that Darragh would not regard an oath into which he had been frightened; and, that while either he or his servant remained in the neighbourhood, neither of them would be safe from his malignity. He, therefore, desired Hunter to proceed immediately on his journey with Mullins, and mentioned his intention to follow them as soon as he could make a proper excuse to O'Halloran for his hasty departure. Hunter accordingly set off with his companion, but contrived to go nearly a mile out of his proper course, to give a parting salute to Peggy Caldwell. He found her blushing like one of the daughters of the morning; and hastily seizing her by the waist, impressed a short but hearty farewell upon her lips. She burst from his arms in some trepidation; but he soon again caught her. “Hoot, Peggy, lass,” said he, in an endearing tone, “dinna be sae flirted. It's a fareweel kiss for a few days. I'm gaun on an erran' o' your frien' Mr. Middleton. But you may tell my mother an' the rest, that I expect to be back in time to help to set the potatoes in the Lime-Kiln Knowe.” He then gaily mounted his steed, and Mullins and he galloped off. In a short time, however, he slackened his speed to what may be called a conversation pace, for his heart was full of Peggy, and he wished to relieve his feelings by descanting on her charms. “Isn't she a pretty lass, that?” said he to Mullins, “hae ye ony like her up the country, amang the wild Irish?” “In troth and we have,” replied Tom, “as beautiful creatures there, as ever sat by a turf fire to sing a poor fellow's heart to rest after a hard day's digging. By the mother of me! if the sweet looks of Biddy O'Flagherty herself, my second cousin, whom the priest wouldn't let me marry, bad luck to him! wouldn't have pierced the heart of a blind man, that is, if he had eyes to see her.” Instead of attending to Tom's eulogy on the power of Biddy O'Flagherty's charms, Hunter began in the fulness of his heart, to sing from the Gentle Shepherd. “My Peggy is a young thing, Just entered in her teens; Fair as day and sweet as May, Fair as day and always gay; My Peggy is a young thing, An' I'm no' very auld, An' weel I like to meet her at The walking o' the fauld.” At length he stopped. “Weel, Tam,” said he, “I'll no' dispute the matter o' Biddy, what do ye ca' her, being a bonny lass; but gie me my ain Peggy, an' I care na' wha gets a' the lave o' the bonny lasses in the country. I'm thinking, Tam, its no' a bad thing to be married, when yin gets wha yin likes.” “By my shoul, and that's my own opinion to a hair, master James;” replied Tom, “and Bridget's own self, the dear creature, would have married me; but that ill-looking thief, priest O'Bletherem, I said he would excommunicate us for heresy, unless we paid him twenty pounds for a pardon; and the devil a twenty pounds had poor Tom Mullins in his life. So I thought it best to go to sarvice, and left my mother, and Paddy, and Barney, and little Juddy, to work at home, until I should make twenty pounds; and my master, God bless him, for he's a gentleman every inch of him, says he'll help me to get the priest's pardon as soon as we return home.” “Damn the priest! Tam,” exclaimed Hunter, “why didn't you kick the rascal oot o' the hoose, for pitting atween you an' your sweetheart. Why, man, if Peggy were yince agreed, an' wha kens hoo soon it may be sae, a' the priests on this side o' hell, wi' the wh—re o' Babylon at their back, should na prevent us fra' being married. Hoot, man, when you gang hame, marry your lassie; tak' a frien's advice. Gin your master gies you twenty pund, lay it out on plenishing, an' stock for your farm, an' ne'er fash your thumb aboot the priest and his d—d pardon.” “Master Hunter,” said Tom, “I believe you are a friend to poor Mullins, after all, for my own mother never gave me such good advice. Ah! honey, why weren't you with us when we argued the case with the priest, but could make nothing of him at all, at all; but had to listen and tremble, for he swore he would never let our souls, that is after they are dead, out of purgatory, if we got married and didn't pay him.” “By Heavens! Tam,” exclaimed Hunter, “had I been there, I would hae thrashed the scoundrel, as soundly as ever he'll be thrashed in purgatory, though I hae a notion that auld Satan winna spare him, yince he gets his claws on him.” We shall leave our love-sick rustics to proceed on their journey, and entertain each other in their own unadorned and homely style, and direct our attention to Edward Barrymore, who was as deeply enamoured as either of them, and at that very moment anxiously pining for an opportunity to pledge his vows to the mistress of his affections. But in order to proceed with his affairs, we must open another chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. VII. Maid of the lovely rolling eye, Maid of each grace that kindles love, Ah! do not frown to hear me sigh, Nor do my faithful flame reprove! For shouldst thou unpropitious be, My griefs in secret shall remain; Ah! never will I tell to thee, What would the hallowed bosom pain. Thaunus the Druid. The reader will remember that we left Edward and the Recluse together in the cavern. The old man, reluctant as he was to part with our hero, acknowledged the necessity of his speedily withdrawing from that part of the country, since he had, however innocently and unintentionally, became an object of suspicion to some of the United Irishmen. “The virtuous and more influential of them” said he, “I know will oppose to the utmost of their power, any attempt to injure you, and will, no doubt, succeed in frustrating any such attempt if they only obtain timely information of its being intended. But the framers of this confederacy, have not been choice in selecting its members; and the more wicked and abandoned of them pay little respect to the opinions and wishes of the wiser and more virtuous, when they do not happen to correspond with their own passions and prejudices. It is not, therefore, to be expected that the injunctions of O'Halloran, or any other of their leaders, will have much influence in restraining the violence of such men as Darragh and his companion, who would set the orders of their supreme directory itself, if they interfered with their views, at defiance.” “My friend,” replied Edward, “your good sense, and the interest you have evinced in my welfare, deserve my confidence. I will, therefore, entrust the dearest wishes of my soul to your keeping. It is now become necessary that I should leave this part of the country. Not only my own safety, but, perhaps, the safety of one dearer to me than myself, demands it; for, if I should fall, who would then, with the same solicitude, watch over her and defend her from danger? Ah! sir, so strongly have my affections become riveted on that object, that I feel as if one of the strings of my heart were breaking, when I think of leaving the part of the country where she resides, and, in times too like these, when evils threaten her from every quarter. Should misfortune overtake her in my absence, my only consolation will be, a reliance on your prudence and friendship to afford her protection, until I can fly to her aid. Promise me that you will give me frequent and speedy information of whatever may befal her; and that when the storm bursts, you will, if in your power, in this sacred asylum, afford her shelter from its fury. Promise me this, and the weight of anxiety that now oppresses me, shall be greatly relieved.” “I not only promise you this,” said the Recluse, “but whatever else may be in my power to do for the safety and welfare of Ellen Hamilton.” “Will you consent to be the medium of any communications I may transmit to her?” asked Edward. “I will,” replied the Recluse without hesitation, “unless she forbids it. But hasten from this dangerous neighbourhood, for here there are active and malignant spirits aroused against you, for your I 2 destruction. Farewell, and may the Almighty God of all things, protect and bless you!” “Farewell, father,” said Edward, and he hastened to apprise O'Halloran of his intended departure, and to seek a farewell interview with Ellen. The early part of the morning had been somewhat cloudy; and one of those gentle rains, known among the Northern Irish, by the name of May showers, had fallen, and rendered the atmosphere moist but not cold. The day, however, assumed a brighter aspect, and the advancing sun had dried away all the lucid pearls that had lately bespangled the tender springing grass, the lovely richness of whose verdure has procured for Ireland the appropriate epithet of the Emerald Isle. With this refreshing verdure were intermixed innumerable multitudes of those simple flowers, so sweetly described in the beautiful pastoral song of Gramachree. The primrose pale and violet blue, Lay scattered o'er the fields; The daisy pied, and all the sweets The dawn of nature yields; Such fragrance in the bosom lies, Of her whom I adore; Ah Gramachree, &amp;c. Invited by the beauty of the season, and of the weather, Mrs. Brown, after breakfast, proposed to the ladies to walk along the meadows that skirted the shore, and lay between the castle and the promontory of Ballygally. “Miss O'Halloran,” said Miss Agnew as they walked onwards, “do you think this Mr. Middleton will remain long here? If I only knew who he is, and if he were only a little merrier in his manner, he appears in other respects, such an elegant young fellow, that I could almost fall in love with him; that is, I beg pardon, if he be not already engaged.” “That begging pardon,” replied Ellen, “seems to come rather awkwardly into such a fine promising speech, for I cannot see what connexion it has with any other part of it.” “O! dear me, Ellen,” cried the other, “I forgot that love is always blind, or I would have spoken more plainly. The propriety of this improperly introduced ejaculation, only consists in the desire I had to obtain the pardon of your fair self, for proposing to fall in love with a handsome young man, whom you had the advantage of first seeing, and, of course, the privilege of first loving.” “If it will be any advantage to you,” retorted Ellen, “I will relinquish my privilege in your favour; and here, in the presence of my aunt, I give you full liberty to fall in love with him, as soon and as deeply as you think proper.” “Very disinterested!” exclaimed Miss Agnew; “It is not every young lady now-a-days, who will sacrifice love to friendship.” “Hush!” said Mrs. Brown, “here comes the gentleman himself, and really he is such a fine looking youth, that if I were only forty years younger, I should threaten you both with a rival. As it is, however, I have a good mind to inform him of your controversy, and let him choose between you.” “Oh! aunt,” exclaimed Ellen, “do not, I beseech you, mention that we spoke of him. You know I did not—it was altogether Miss Agnew's mad talk.” “I really believe, child,” said Mrs. Brown, that you are somewhat in love. This seriousness betrays you.” “Believe what you please, dear aunt, but do not mention that we spoke of him.” “At all events,” cried Miss Agnew, “don't tell him till we reach the top of the hill yonder, and then, you know, we can act the three gooddesses on Mount Ida, and he shall be Paris to settle our controversy.” “I should not wish to go through such a scene,” replied Mrs. Brown, “lest it should be followed by a similar result. Juno and Pallas would imbibe eternal hatred against Venus, and then, nothing but war, barbarous war, could be expected amongst us.” “O then,” said Ellen, entreatingly, “let us say nothing about it. Let us meet the young man, and treat him civilly; but I would not, for the world, that he should know, he excited any particular conversation amongst us.” “We shall talk of this again,” said Mrs. Brown, in a whisper to Ellen, for Edward was now so near, as to prevent her from speaking aloud, unless she chose that he should hear what she said. She then turned to him. “Mr. Middleton,” said she, “if you have no better employment in view, we shall be gratified with your company during our ramble.” “You cannot be so much gratified with my company as I shall be with your's,” replied Edward, “and, surely, Mrs. Brown cannot suppose me so insensible to the beauties of nature, and the charms of refined conversation, as not to prefer the enjoyment of such a scene, in such a company, to any other employment whatever.” “I expected as much from your gallantry,” rejoined Mrs. Brown. “But, aunt,” said Ellen, “if Mr. Middleton has any business of importance to attend to, you know that it would be wrong that he should neglect it on our account.” He assured them that he had no business on hand of sufficient importance to induce him to forego the pleasures he felt in their company. “How do you like the appearance of our part of the country?” asked Mrs. Brown, turning round upon an eminence to which they had arrived; and from which they had a tolerable prospect of the surrounding scenery.” “Every thing in your country,” replied Edward, “has had the effect of highly interesting my feelings, and exciting my admiration. The wonderful curiosities and romantic grandeur of your bold basaltic coast, could not fail to impress attention from the most unobservant spectator; while the fervid feelings which animate your people must be a subject of deep interest, not unmixed, I must confess, in these distracted times, with some concern, in the breast of every one who wishes for their happiness. In short, since I visited these scenes, I may truly say that I have lived more, that is, I have felt more of both the sweets and bitters of life, short as the period has been, than I did through the whole previous course of my existence.” “I really believe you have felt sharply of the bitters,” said Miss Agnew. “Yon gulf below gave you a strong and almost a fatal sample of them.” “Had I met with nothing to make a deeper impression on my mind,” replied Edward, “than the accident to which you allude, in leaving these scenes, my regret would not, perhaps, have been greater than it will be, but my recollections would have been more unmingled with sorrow. In short, ladies, I, this morning, received accounts which constrain me to an almost instantaneous departure, a circumstance which I assure you gives me a heavy heart.” In saying this, he turned his eyes towards Ellen. She attempted to speak, but her voice faultered, while the blood which but the moment before had spread the bloom of roses on her cheeks, had fled and left them as pale as ivory. “What is the matter?” exclaimed Mrs. Brown, who had observed her emotion. “Nothing,” she replied. “I felt suddenly a little dizzy. I, perhaps—I was fatigued; but I am now better.” “You are weak,” said Edward, in agitation, “may I beg permission to support you?” “It—it is not now necessary; I am quite well again.” “We had better return home,” said Mrs. Brown, “Mr. Middleton you will have the goodness to support her.” Edward again offered his assistance, requesting her to lean on his arm. She reluctantly complied; but desired her aunt not to forego the pleasure of a longer excursion, as she felt perfectly able to continue it. “Well then,” said Miss Agnew, “let us proceed to the top of the hill, as we before proposed. Mrs. Brown and I shall drag each other up—and since you have become an invalid, we will permit you to engross all Mr. Middleton's assistance. Come along, Mrs. Brown, we had better take a start of them, for you see we are to have no help but our own agility in the ascent.” So saying, she dragged Mrs. Brown onwards, telling her that the two sentimental people behind would follow on the wings of imagination. “Do not leave us,” cried Ellen, “or I shall be again obliged to fatigue myself in hurrying after you.” Whether it was by accident or design, however, let love-casuists determine, instead of keeping pace with their companions, Edward and Ellen walked so slowly that in a few minutes the others were too far advanced to hear their conversation. “Ah! Miss O'Halloran,” said Edward, who gladly seized so favourable an opportunity of opening his soul to his beloved, “you cannot imagine the pangs that I feel on account of leaving this place, for you are not aware how powerful are the chains that bind me to it. I have travelled round the greater part of the kingdom, I have witnessed numerous interesting scenes, and have fallen in with company of the most worthy and attractive description; but here alone it is that my heart has been touched, here it is that my affections have become centred.” “You speak of some necessity that compels you to leave us; I hope that necessity includes no misfortune.” “I feel that the greatest misfortune attending my departure is the circumstance itself. My dear Ellen, forgive the expression, but Providence has given me this much-desired opportunity of telling you my whole heart, and I must not let it pass unimproved. You alone are the object that binds me to this spot. Ah! dare I hope that this declartion is not offensive to you? Dare I indulge the expectation that when I am afar off, you will sometimes reflect with complacency on the wanderer who, on seeing you, first saw the object to whom his soul must forever be devoted, the object that has charmed his sensations into a new feeling of existence.” “Mr. Middleton,” said Ellen, extremely embarrassed, “is it proper that I should listen to this language?” “I shall not long trouble you with it,” he replied. “I know I am a stranger, in whose professions, I have no right to require that you should confide. Of my family, my prospects and my standing in society, you have no knowlege. It is, therefore, I confess, presumption in me to solicit your confidence, to request your regard, without informing you of these particulars. But ah! my beloved, say, has no youth, more fortunate than I, and known to you, and worthy of you, in all these respects, already engaged your affections? If so, my fate is decided. I shall not disturb your peace by obtruding on your notice a passion which you cannot return, nor will I endeavour to secure a place in your heart, if that heart be another's.” “Why sir,” said she, “do you ask from me such a confession?” “I have no right, I acknowledge,” he replied, “to require any such disclosure from you. Forgive the freedom I have taken. All my happiness depends upon your favourable opinion of me. O! surely it cannot be unpardonable in me to be desirous of knowing whether that heart is irrecoverably another's, which I would stop at no sacrifice, except that of virtue and honour, to make my own. O, Ellen! if a love as warm and sincere as ever animated a human breast, can excuse the liberty I have taken, I can plead that love, an equal to which no other woman shall ever awaken in my bosom.” “Mr. Middleton” said she, in a serious tone, “I believe you are a man of honour, and of too much generosity to sport with the feelings of an unoffending and inexperienced girl, merely for the gratification of curiosity or caprice. I feel no offence at your inquiry, although, I confess, that I am not sure whether in prudence, I ought not to be offended. Of this, however, I am certain, that under present circumstances, it would be highly imprudent to promise a return of those feelings you profess for me. I feel grateful for your preference, and as a mark of my gratitude, I may inform you that to none of your sex have I ever pledged my affections.” “Thank God!” exclaimed Edward, fervently, “then I may hope. Oh! do not forget me, dearest Ellen, in my absence. I must now leave you. My soul sinks under the idea. Trouble and calamity threaten the country. They may even reach thee, pure, and lovely, and innocent as thou art, before thy lover can fly to thy aid. But I trust that God will protect thee. To his keeping I resign thee, until I again inhale love and joy from thy presence. Then, then I hope to plead my suit under circumstances more favourable for its acceptance. The Recluse will often let you hear from me.” “Hush!” said Ellen, “my aunt and Miss Agnew have turned back for us.”—This either of them might have seen for several minutes before, had they not been too much engrossed with each other; in other words, had not love rendered them blind. They had made such slow progress during their conversation, that their companions, without being aware of it, had advanced nearly half a mile before them, when Mrs. Brown turning round, observed the distance, and suggested the propriety of returning to meet them. Miss Agnew and she, were in consequence within a few yards of the lovers, when Ellen suddenly observed their proximity and uttered the exclamation, “hush!” as before stated. “You must be very weak, Ellen, otherwise you would have walked faster,” said her aunt. “O! dear me,” cried Miss Agnew, “do you not see how strong she looks? We left her as pale as sackcloth, leaning for support on the arm of that gentleman. Now she blushes like a carnation, and appears as if afraid to touch him. Come, Mr. Middleton, give me your arm. I am in more need of your assistance, after that long walk, than she is.” “And what assistance must an old frail woman like me, need, after such a walk, if a young smart chit, like you, requires any?” cried Mrs. Brown, sportively, and she also caught an arm of Edward, saying, “Ellen has monopolized you long enough; K it is now our turn; Miss Agnew and I cannot bear to be longer neglected.” “O dear!” cried Miss Agnew, “do not let us fight about the gentleman. I fear Ellen has not willingly resigned him, and we are intruders.” “I indeed resign him cheerfully,” said Ellen, “I am now perfectly recovered, and can ascend the hill without fearing fatigue.” “So can I,” cried Miss Agnew, “give me your arm, my sprightly maiden, and we shall show that gentleman and lady, that we have both life and limbs, when we choose to use them;” and she seized Ellen for the purpose of dragging her forward on a race. “You are too wild,” said Ellen, slightly restraining her, “when will you become sober?” “Not till I fall in love,” said Miss Agnew, “and then, you know, I shall be as ready to sigh and become pensive and fatigued as yourself.” They were too far removed from Edward and Mrs. Brown, for the latter to hear the last remark, which prevented Ellen from suffering all the confusion it would otherwise have occasioned. “You insinuate then, Maria,” said she, calling Miss Agnew by her christian name, “that I am in love.” “I am sure of it,” said Maria. “No female heart could withstand the partiality which that charming young man shows for you, not to mention the interesting circumstance of assisting to raise him from the dead: much as I value my own resolution, I believe, Ellen, that if I were similarly circumstanced, I should myself love him.” “Mad-cap!” said Ellen; “quit this subject. It is all nonsense; but—but, what partiality has he shown for me? I am sure you could never have observed any.” “Rare consistence!” cried Maria. “You desire me to drop the subject; and then, you ask me a question which compels me to continue it. But this is so characteristic of a love-sick damsel, that it does not surprise me; and, dear Ellen, in pity to you, I will not drag you from the young man's company. It would be cruel as he is so soon to leave us.” She then turned suddenly, and held Ellen, who blushed deeply, from advancing. “Come on,” cried she, “this blushing girl and I would be at the top of the hill in a minute, did we not love our company too well to leave it.” Edward and Mrs. Brown approached. They had walked slowly, for they had conversed on the alarming nature of the times, and short as their discourse had been, Edward could easily perceive that the old lady's feelings rather than her judgment sided with the United Irishmen. “They are my countrymen,” said she, “and although their struggle may be to recover rights which you think are not lost, or to obtain objects which are but of visionary consequence—they may demand that liberty which you say they already enjoy, and may contend for an equality which instead of benefiting them, might be their greatest political misfortune; notwithstanding all this, if they be conscientious in their aims, which I believe the majority of them are, I must regard them with complaisance. If they believe themselves oppressed, which I know they do, and ah, sir, do not some of them also feel it, resistance to oppression is natural, it is noble and manly, and must ever secure my affections to its cause.” Before Edward could reply, they were hailed by Maria, as we have already observed. “Ah, Miss Giddyhead, I see what you wish for,” cried Mrs. Brown aloud, while she advanced to Maria, “here, take Mr. Middleton to yourself. You envy every one who has but a few minutes conversation with him, though I think you need not have become jealous of an old woman of sixty.” “A woman of Mrs. Brown's accomplishments and power of conversation, might excite my envy at any age,” replied Maria; “but do you think that no other person than Maria Agnew envies you?” “If there be any one else, she has not, at least, betrayed it so audibly,” said Mrs. Brown. “What, Mr. Middleton,” she continued, “do you think of two young women in all the charms of youth and beauty, becoming jealous of old age and decayed nature enjoying a few moments of your company? You must surely have made a progress in their esteem warmer than the usual esteem of friends.” “I should be proud to excite such an esteem,” said he, “but I fear I am not so happy.” In saying this he cast a look at Ellen, who unconsciously returned a glance that spoke peace to his soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. VIII. No titled birth had he to boast, Son of the desert, Fortune's child. Yet not by frowning fortune crossed, The Muses on his cradle smiled. He joy'd to con the fabling page, Of prowess'd chiefs and deeds sublime; And even essay'd in infant age, Fond task, to weave the wizzard rhyme. Dermody. Our party ascended to the top of the promontory, from whence they descried the gulf below. It was the very place where Edward had first seen his beloved as if he had seen a vision of light; and where, charmed to the spot, he had lingered until he encountered death, and would have fallen in the combat, had not the same vision become his guardian angel, and sent effectual succour to his rescue. Amidst the reflections which this scene excited, he was interrupted by Mrs. Brown, who pointed to an arbour, at some distance, made of the interwoven branches of willows, round which honeysuckles exuberantly entwined their tendrills. It was constructed in the neatest style, consistent with that rustic simplicity which seemed to have been studied by its architect. Within its sylvan walls a semi-circular range of seats were formed of earth, and covered over with a fragrant bed of chamomile and thyme. The floor was simply of nature's making, and the only furniture it appeared to contain was a small folding table placed in the centre. “This is, indeed, a remarkable spot for a summer-house; K 2 but a very suitable one for an observatory,” remarked Edward. “It is not so much used,” said Mrs. Brown, “for the study of the stars, as for the worship of the Muses. It has been erected by a young man of our neighbourhood, who, although he performs the office of a teacher to the farmers' children, contrives to find sufficient leisure to study nature, poetry and taste, in this temple of simplicity.” “I imagine,” said Edward, “I have already been delighted with one of the effusions of your rural bard. Is it so, Miss O'Halloran?” he added. “Yes, sir,” she replied. “Poor M`Nelvin, as the old harper called him, the author of the verses to which you allude, is the possessor of this arbour.” “Is he unfortunate,” asked Edward, “and can you tell from what cause?” “He is unfortunate, and I can tell the cause; but, alas! it is beyond human power to relieve him. With one of the best and warmest hearts, he is a prey to a melancholy disposition, the cause of which, had he less susceptibility of feeling he would not permit to make such an impression on his mind. His body is deformed from an accidental injury he received when a child; and as the deformity cramps his personal exertions for eminence in the world, he permits his feelings of disappointment and regret, to weigh too heavily on him. What has lately, I believe, tended to increase his melancholy is the turn which the political prospects of the country have taken. Formerly he was affable and communicative; but, for some months past, he has become particularly reserved and averse to society.” “I should be glad of the acquaintance of this young man,” said Edward, “and I am sorry that the necessity of my speedy departure will deprive me of that pleasure.” “You shall have that pleasure in five minutes,” cried Miss Agnew, “for yonder he is, just appearing from the side of the hill.” They all observed him; but it was only for a moment; for he suddenly turned, and retracing his steps rather hastily, as if he wished to avoid them, disappeared. “Shall I run after him?” said Miss Agnew: I'll overtake him in a minute.” “I request,” said Edward, “that you will not occasion him any pain on my account.” “I also request,” added Mrs. Brown, “that the young man may be left to his own inclinations. He seems desirous to avoid us at present, and we have no right to force ourselves upon him.” “Well, well,” returned Miss Agnew gaily, “since I am not allowed to run after young men, I shall take care to allow no young man to run after me: So, if you please, Mr. Middleton, you will either walk along side of me or before me.” They now descended the hill on their way to the castle. On coming to a smooth, gently sloping lawn of considerable extent, near the bottom, Ellen stopped suddenly. “Here is the spot,” said she, “where I felt the first thrill of patriotism that ever warmed my heart. Here it was that I first felt devoted to my country's cause; for here while only in my fourteenth year, I was present, for the first and the last time, at a review of a large party of that noble army of patriots, the Irish Volunteers. To my view, their appearance, that day, exhibited something more magnificent and impressive than any thing of which my young ideas had ever formed a conception. I rejoiced to see my country's strength displayed in the unbought energies of her sons. In performing their evolutions, they appeared as if they were animated with one soul, and their dress and the brilliancy of their arms, displayed the highest polish of military splendour. I looked upon them as an irresistible band of heroes; and my heart throbbed with rapture to think that those heroes were my acquaintances, my neighbours, my friends, my protectors; and that if ever their weapons should be stained with human blood, it should be the blood of my country's enemies. I saw them, and became proud of my country; and frequently to this day, does my imagination present the scene before me in all its liveliness; but, alas! it is now only imagination!” “I delight in your enthusiasm,” said Edward, “and cannot but heartily condemn the ungenerous and imprudent policy which occasioned the disorganization of that gallant association of soldiers.” “I have seen,” said Mrs. Brown, “various reviews of military; and I must confess that I never saw a body of men exhibit a more imposing and soldier-like appearance, than the Volunteers did on that day. I do not, indeed, wonder that they should have made Ellen proud of the country, for on that day I felt in my own breast, a warmer pulse of patriotism than I ever experienced before. “I never again saw them embodied; for a jealous and ungrateful government, in a short time afterwards, issued its mandate for their suppression. Ah! little did I think when, on that day, I heard the last sound of their martial music, that it was the funeral knell of my country's liberty and peace; and little did I think, when I saw the last glimpse of their standards disappearing beyond yon hill, that I, for the last time, beheld the only soldiers whose hearts and hands were alike sincerely devoted to the salvation of their country!” “I hope,” remarked Miss Agnew, “we may yet see Irish soldiers whom no foreign authority shall have the power to disband.” “Much as I dislike the late despotic measures of the British government,” replied Mrs. Brown, “I cannot yet bring my mind to consider it a foreign one. But I acknowledge that the conduct of its ministers in this country, is every day weakening that partiality I have hitherto felt for it.” “It is indeed to be lamented,” said Edward, “that the interests of the government, and the wishes of the people are so opposed to each other; and, believe me, ladies, I feel as acutely as any Irishman can, for the calamities which such a state of things forbodes to the country.” “In reading history,” remarked Ellen, “I have often wondered at the cruelty of all governments. They universally seem to delight more in keeping the people in subjection by terror and punishment, than in securing their affections by kindness and benefits. It is surely a strange taste in rulers, and is to me quite unaccountable, that they should take pleasure in the misery of their fellow-creatures. But rulers are generally men; methinks that our sex would both feel and act more tenderly towards those in their power.” As this opinion of the fair Ellen might lead to a controversy, which would require a more thoroughbred politician than myself to decide, and as I trust that my reader is such a one, I will leave it altogether to his disposal. Having arrived at the castle, Edward took O'Halloran aside, and informed him of the necessity he was under of immediately leaving the country. O'Halloran startled a little at the intelligence; and, although it was nothing but what he might have expected, he appeared very much confused. At last recovering his self-possession, “Mr. Middleton,” said he, “I did not calculate on your leaving us so soon, at least so suddenly; but if the cause of your departure be not extremely urgent, I request that you will not go until to-morrow.” Edward was himself much inclined to remain till the next day. A wish to be introduced to the poet, M`Nelvin, and a desire to spend another night, under the same roof with his beloved Ellen, predominated over his prudence; and he yielded to O'Halloran's request. O'Halloran was not unacquainted with the danger which threatened his guest from the violence of Darragh, and some others of the conspirators; and he began to suspect that their threats had reached Edward's ears, and produced his sudden determination to leave the neighbourhood. He himself had some doubts whether the secrets of his party with which this young stranger had involuntarily become acquainted, were altogether safe in his keeping. Although he had hitherto resisted the solicitations of his confederates to prevent his departure, by securing his person, least he should discover on them, he began now to have serious doubts as to the propriety of his so doing. In great agitation of mind he left Edward, and retired to his library to reflect on the most proper mode of proceeding. “Were I alone involved in the dangers of this young man's discovering upon us, I would then be justifiable in running the risk;” he thus reasoned with himself; “but the safety of others is also concerned; nay, perhaps, the success of all our plans to emancipate our country may be affected by either his imprudent communication, or intentional discovery of what he knows; and it is certain that he knows sufficient to ruin all. It is enough, it must be—my mind is resolved—my conscience may accuse me of perfidy to my guest; but my duty to the public cause in which I am embarked, is of infinitely more importance than any personal consideration. He must be secured; but his life must be preserved from all dangers; and he must be so treated as to have no privation of which to complain, but the loss of personal liberty.” Having brought his mind to this conclusion, he went in search of M`Cauley, and the other leading conspirators. They soon agreed on a plan for seizing Edward. “A single hair of his head shall not fall,” said M`Cauley, in the course of their deliberation, “if I can prevent it; for, I am myself to blame for too rashly communicating to him that information by which he can most seriously injure us.” Mr. Samuel Nelson, one of the proprietors of the Northern Star, a man of great intelligence, and one of the most influential leaders of the association in the North, was present at this deliberation. His opinion coincided with that of M`Cauley and O'Halloran, that Edward should be well treated, but strictly guarded. “Such a captive,” he remarked, “may ultimately be of great service to us as an hostage for the safety of some of our own party; besides, as he has not yet manifested any other hostility towards us, than merely refusing to join us, it would be unjust as well as impolitic to exercise any other severity towards him, than may be absolutely necessary for our own safety.” It was then unanimously settled that Edward should be seized that evening, and confined in the Point Cave, (which was within the mysterious rock already mentioned,) but that he should be there treated with every indulgence the circumstances of the case would admit. After dinner, the unsuspecting object of these machinations, paid a visit to William Caldwell's, to make his acknowledgments for the kindness he had experienced from his family, and also with the hope that he might there meet with an opportunity of being introduced to M`Nelvin; for he understood that the poet was on a very intimate footing with this family. In the latter object of his visit, he was, however, disappointed. On his return he met with the Recluse, to whom he reported his wishes on this subject. “You wish for a gratification,” said the old man, “which it will be no easy matter to procure you. But if it be in the power of any one, I think it is in mine. You will, no doubt, be surprised when I tell you that he whose acquaintance you seek, studiously avoids yours, not from any prejudice he has imbibed against your person or principles—on the contrary, I know that he highly respects both; but he is influenced with regard to you by a delicacy, perhaps I should rather say, a weakness of feeling on a tender point. In short, he loves Ellen Hamilton with a hopeless passion, indulged in secret, and he has perceived that you are an ardent, and likely to be a favoured rival. I am the sole confidant of his sorrows. His passion is involuntarily; but it is acute; and as it is cherished altogether against hope, I pity him.” “Perhaps then,” said Edward, “it is better I should not see him, for I should feel reluctant to occasion him the smallest pain.” “My friend,” replied the hermit, “I should wish you and him to be acquainted with each other, as I know it would increase your mutual esteem. His personal deformity makes him shy with strangers; and the particular circumstances of which I have informed you would make him more than usually so with you. I think, however, that the first interview would be sufficient to remove this feeling. So, if you have no objection, we shall proceed to my cave, where I expect to find him very shortly. It is to him alone, besides yourself, that I have entrusted the secret of my inner dwelling; nay, it is to him alone, of all my friends in this neighbourhood, that I have as yet intrusted the story of my misfortunes, a story concerning which even to you, I must, for some time yet, take the liberty of preserving silence.” Edward acquiesced, and they soon arrived at the old man's dwelling. They were not long seated until the secret door in the bureau opened, and M`Nelvin appeared. He seemed somewhat disconcerted on seeing Edward, but at the Recluse's desire he came forward. “Let me introduce the two most confidential friends I have in this part of the country to each other,” said the old man, “and I doubt not that on further acquaintance, they will both thank me for doing so.” Edward approached, and shook the poet's hand so cordially that his reserve almost instantly vanished; and during the conversation which ensued, he became so cheerful and communicative, and displayed such an extent of information and strength of intellect, as surprised and delighted his new acquaintance. When they discoursed on politics, and M`Nelvin descanted on the natural rights of man, Edward felt within his breast a new conviction of the injustice and iniquity of arbitrary rule; and when he spoke of the benefits arising from the establishment of known laws for the regulation of society, and the maintenance of security and order among mankind, Edward could not refrain from wishing that the disorganizers of the age had only an opportunity of hearing such sentiments so enforced; but when he described and deplored the accumulating miseries of his country, it was with a fervour that almost brought tears to his own eyes, and filled, almost to bursting, the hearts of his auditors; and Edward could not avoid execrating that mismanagement, to which these measures L were so clearly and so feelingly ascribed. When on the subject of poetry, he enlarged on the influence of its precepts on the conduct of men, the power which it often exerts over their dispositions, and the enjoyment it yields, by its pleasing representations of virtue and happiness, when it chooses to display them unalloyed with the sad realities of life; or, by its delightful delusions when it carries the enchanted fancy into a species of transient paradise, where the cares, and pains, and vexations of the grosser world, are, for a time, neither felt or remembered—Edward thought that he had never been before so thoroughly convinced of the benefits it confers upon mankind. Thus the man whose poetical talents had excited his curiosity, and whose misfortunes he was prepared to pity, he found possessed of dignity which enforced his respect, and of wisdom which commanded his admiration; and he never felt so ardent a desire as on this occasion, to make amends for the injustice of fortune by some munificent testimony of his respect for merit. Accordingly, after M`Nelvin had left the cavern, which he did early in the evening, he consulted the Recluse as to the manner in which he could best serve so deserving an object. “I know, at present, no other way,” said the old man, “than by showing him your countenance, maintaining a correspondence with him, and perhaps, occasionally administering to his poetical vanity; for, like all other poets, he is vain of his profession. Pecuniary assistance must not be mentioned. In the present state of his feelings, he would look upon it as a manitestation of your superiority. His pride would be wounded, and his reserve towards you might return, never to remove. The inconveniencies of poverty, I can and shall prevent.” “I envy you,” returned Edward, “the felicity of being permitted to confer favours on such a man. I trust the time will come when I shall enjoy more of both his society and yours, under happier circumstances.” He then, after requesting the Recluse to remember his wishes respecting Ellen, bade him adieu, and returned to the castle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. IX. Thy arm is firm, thy heart is stout, But thou canst neither fight or flee; But beauty stands thy guard without, Yes, beauty weeps and pleads for thee. Hogg. On emerging from the hermit's glen, our hero perceived four men sitting on an eminence near the path by which he was to pass. He approached, and soon knew one of them to be his new and undesired acquaintance, M`Cauley, who arose, and very respectfully saluted him. “Mr. Middleton,” said he, “I am glad to meet with you. Will you favour me with your company towards the beach?” Edward was about excusing himself, on account of the lateness of the hour, when M`Cauley caught him familiarly by the arm, and in a half jocular and half irritating manner, swore an oath that he would not part with him for that evening at least. Edward remonstrated, and told him that he did not think it friendly, so rudely to impose on his inclinations. “Mr. Middleton! you had as well consent,” said the other, “to accompany me. I assure you no harm shall befall you; and you see,” he added, looking at his companions, “that we can enforce compliance.” Edward now perceived that foul play was intended, and he demanded by what authority they attempted to detain him. “By the authority of present strength, and a prudent regard for our own safety,” replied M`Cauley. “And where am I to go, and for what purpose?” was next demanded. “To our head-quarters, to be both well secured and well treated,” was the reply. “Does Mr. O'Halloran know this?” “He does; and its necessity grieves him.” “Then I submit,” said Edward. “He once saved my life; he is now welcome to take it from me. Lead where you please.” The four men enclosed him round, and conducted him to the very spot where O'Halloran and his grand-daughter vanished from his sight when he first saw them on the beach. One of them then ascended a projecting portion of the mysterious rock, and removing a loose piece of stone, which filled a narrow crevice about a foot deep, an iron ring was disclosed, on pulling which an internal bolt gave way, and permitted the upper end of a large, rugged fragment of the rock, to separate the mass with which it before seemed to have been consolidated. M`Cauley then introduced his hand and loosened the end of a rope, which, passing through a pully fastened to the roof of the cave now visible, had its other end fixed firmly unto the moveable fragment which was thus managed as a door, its base, upon which it turned, being joined to the rock by means of strong hinges, altogether invisible on the outside. The rope being thus loosened, the fragment opened wide enough to afford space for the admission of our party in a stooping posture, but on advancing a few steps, Edward found himself in an apartment fully ten feet high, having a smooth hard-beaten artificially made earthen floor. Through this, he was conducted to another apartment, very spacious, clean-looking and lighted with several lamps. In its centre there was a large table covered with newspapers, pamphlets, letters, &amp;c. which three L 2 genteelly dressed men seemed to have been perusing. These gentlemen accosted Edward in rather a cordial manner, and welcomed him to their habitation. They were quite unknown to him, but one of them, he soon perceived from his accent to be a Frenchman. He now saw that he had been ushered into one of the council-chambers of the Northern conspirators; but for what purpose, he could not tell; although he was persuaded that it could not be of a friendly nature. Here the men by whom he was seized left him. By his remaining companions he was politely invited to be seated, and to accept refreshment. Conceiving that there was no use in showing ill humour on the occasion, he assented, when, to his surprise, tea was speedily produced with its usual accompaniments, and afterwards punch, of which his companions partook in a spirit of great cordiality. During the evening politics engrossed less of the conversation than he expected. Literature, agriculture and manufactures were the prevailing topics. On these, Edward cheerfully took a part, and almost forgot that he was a prisoner. His new acquaintances seemed highly intelligent, and perfectly conversant with every subject they discussed; they were easy and affable, and appeared to make his comfort their chief study. At length one of them requesting leave to show him where he should rest, when he wished to retire for the night, pushed a sliding door along one end of the apartment, which disclosed to view a small room resembling the state-room of the cabin of a merchant ship, and containing a bed of a comfortable appearance. On bidding good night, one of the company remarked, “I trust, Mr. Middleton, that the cause of your confinement here will soon be removed; but whether it shall be long or short, you may depend on receiving good usage.” In fact, such is the influence of civil treatment on the mind, that for some time after he was alone, Edward felt more astonishment than irritation at the occurrences of the evening. But when he reflected on the loss of his liberty, and on the share which O'Halloran had in effecting it, and which he looked upon, not only as a breach of honour and hospitality, but, from the promise he had exacted from him in the morning, as savouring of treachery itself, he became restless, agitated, irritated; and when he considered that he had done nothing to deserve being thus incarcerated in a den among traitors, his chagrin and resentment partook of a feverish violence, and sleep for that night became a stranger to his eyes. Here for the present we shall leave him, and direct our attention to the inhabitants of the castle, some of whom, by this time, had become as much agitated on his account, as he was himself chagrined and irritated. The perturbation of O'Halloran's mind, now that a deed was done which he could not quite justify, and to which he was accessary, was such as no good man could wish even his worst enemy to experience. “It is I,” thought he, “who have in this affair committed a breach of hospitality and good faith. This young man whose disposition, I believe, to be of the most generous description, reposed implicit confidence in me; and yet I have betrayed him into captivity. He may forgive me, God may forgive me, but I cannot forgive myself.—But”—he would say, his thoughts taking another turn— “Why should I thus condemn myself! I have done no more than my duty to the great cause in which I am engaged. It is true, my private esteem for this young man would have prompted me to act otherwise, but the higher motive of duty made it imperative that I should act as I did. On escaping from us, he might league himself with our oppressors, for he is much inclined to their cause; and might think it incumbent on him to reveal those secrets which we imprudently disclosed to him. No, I will not repent it—although the deed was painful, it was necessary; it was called for by the interest of my country. Why should I grieve. It is weakness. Shall it be said, that O'Halloran wished to sacrifice the great interests of the great cause of Irish liberty, to private feelings or squeamish scrupulosity!” Thus O'Halloran grieved, and reasoned, and reconciled himself to the painful duty, as he esteemed it, which he had performed. It is indeed no wonder, that he who always considered patriotism the first of human virtues, should now when that feeling was so much excited, and strengthened by resentment against national wrongs and oppressions, and by the general enthusiasm of the times, be easily prevailed on to yield the personal safety of a stranger, however well he might think of him, to his country's welfare. But there was another inmate of the castle, whom the events of this evening agitated still more severely than they did O'Halloran. This was she, who, in the estimation of Edward, was the fairest of all Erin's daughters, and whose tears of sorrow shed for him this evening, had he known of them, would have rendered him proud and happy in his misfortunes. Ellen was sitting alone at a window in one of the small turrets on the southern side of the castle, watching, perhaps, the declining tints of the twilight, or contemplating the dangerous aspect of the times, or, what is quite as probable, meditating on the expected return of Edward to the castle. It is certain, that from the window where she was stationed, she could survey the path by which he was to return; and if she at all took notice of the gathering shades, perhaps it was because they marked the lateness of the hour without bringing back the object of her solicitude. While she mused, the moments followed each other slowly, thought anxiously succeeded thought, but still there was no appearance of him for whom she sighed. Several people came at different times up the avenue, but Edward did not come. “A little more patience, and he surely will appear,” thought she. A well-dressed man was perceived approaching at a distance. “Ah! this is surely he?” He drew near enough to be distinguished. It was only a messenger with some news to O'Halloran. Another came. It was only a servant who had been at town. A third, a fourth, all came who were expected, and some who were not expected, but he whom Ellen expected did not come. How provoking is suspense! “I will go down,” thought she, “to the gate: when I perceive his approach, I can easily run back and regain the castle without him seeing me.” She went to the gate. She ventured into the avenue. She saw a tall figure hastily advancing. She retreated within the gate, when looking back she perceived it to be the figure of a woman. She returned to the avenue, and met Peg Dornan. Peg was in great agitation, when she approached. “Some yin maun help him,” she abruptly exclaimed, “an' your ain bonny sel maun haste an' fin' oot that yin, or it may soon be owre wi' him;— an' he liked you weel, an' would hae run to help you in sic need, at the blackest hoor a midnicht.” “What is the matter?” anxiously demanded Ellen, “for whom do you want help?” “For the bonniest lad that e'er cam' to thir parts—for Mr. Middleton, wham I like as weel as e'er I liked Jock Dornan, my ain sin.” “For God's sake! dear Peg, what, what has befallen Mr. Middleton?” “He has fallen amang his enemies.” “What! have they killed him?” exclaimed Ellen, fearfully. “No, my bonny bairn, I hope the hae na yet gane that far; but they're no to be trusted owre lang.” “For heaven's sake! tell me what you know of the matter?” “That's what I cam' for, my bonny bairn, an' you'll hear me. I was saunterin' at my leisure aboot an hour syne, on the road to Saunders's Glen, when I saw four o' the hettist o' the warm crappies, settin' on the road side, an' thinkin' they would be talkin' politics, I did na want to disturb them; so I turned through a slap to the other side o' the hedge, an' I would na hae stapped but gane right on; but when I cam' forenent them, though they did na see me, I heard yin of them say something aboot Mr. Middleton, so I just hunkered doon to hear what it was. “I'll warrant you he's an Orangeman, said Sam Service. “We must seize him, but not hurt him, let him be what he will, said Jock M`Cauley. Our order is to confine him in the Point Cave, where we will soon find out whether he be friendly or not. “I thought it was nae time to listen langer, but to run and warn him to keep oot o' their way, as I did yince before. I e'en ran to Billy Caldwell's, whar I had seen him in the afternoon, but they said he had gane wi' auld Saunders to his glen. I let nae on, but ran there as fast as I could, for, thinks I, they'll get him in the hame comin', giff I dinna see him first. I ran like thoucht, for the deil tak' me gin I'm lazy on sic an erran'. The auld man was in the glen, I asked for Mr. Middleton. “He left me half an hour ago, said he. “Gude preserve us! said I, then he's fa'en in wi' them Auld man, you can do nae guid. I canna wait to talk wi' you. I maun rin to the castle, for, as sure as you're auld Saunders, the crappies hae catched Mr. Middleton for nae guid.—When I said sae, he sprang—I never thoucht the auld body was sae soople. He would hae been here lang before me, had he skipt on at that gate; but he turned an' bade me haste, an' tell a' to either Mr. O'Halloran or Ellen, thinkin', doubtless, that he wad do mar harm than guid by being owre hasty.” “And are you sure they have seized on Mr. Middleton?” inquired Ellen. “They maun ha' him,” replied Peg, “for when I cam' back to whar they were sittin', they were gane. I thought he micht hae escaped them, an' won to the castle; but I met Ned Watt, the butler, just before I saw you, who says he's no come there; so I fear a's no richt.” “It is too plain!” said Ellen almost inaudibly, for speech and sense now failed her, and she sunk on the ground. With a voice like thunder, Peg shouted for help, and in a few seconds, several of the domestics from the castle were on the spot. Ellen soon recovered, and being conveyed to her apartment, she requested Mrs. Brown to remain with her for a short time. All others accordingly withdrew. “My dear aunt,” said she, “I know your penetration has discovered my weakness. I will now therefore no longer affect to conceal it from you. My heart owns a feeling for Mr. Middleton, which is likely to be ruinous to my peace. But in loving him, I have only loved what I conceived to be excellence; and, if I have done wrong, I hope for forgiveness from my more than mother. But he is surely worthy of all the affection I can bestow on him. But, oh! I am miserable; for he is in danger. He has been seized by the United Irishmen, on suspicion of being an orangeman, and heaven only knows if, at this moment, he be not breathing out his soul in agony, under the hands of a murderer. Oh! dear aunt, the idea is terrible, but I fear it is real.” She here clasped the hands of her aunt with a convulsive force, which made that affectionate relative tremble for her safety. If she considered her niece's passion to have been imprudent, and ill timed, she saw that the present was not the period to expostulate or use cool calculating arguments on the subject. She, therefore, adopted the more humane and judicious method of soothing her feelings by expressing a sincere hope, that no evil had befallen Edward; remarking that the informations she had received might be partly or wholly unfounded. At all events, she encouraged her to hope for the best, at least until they should obtain more certain intelligence with regard to any thing disastrous having taken place. Ellen soon became so much quieted as to be able to relate to her all that she had heard from Peg Dornan. Her aunt then promised to communicate with her brother on the subject; and consult him as to what it should be best to do on Edward's behalf. In the meantime none of the castle servants knew of his captivity. O'Halloran himself not being present, Peg Dornan would relate her story to no one else, for she had too much regard for the United Irishmen, as a body, to propagate any report to their disadvantage. She was also aware of the dangerous situation of an informer in those times. She, therefore, especially as she was persuaded that Ellen would lose no time in making her grandfather acquainted with Edward's situation, resolved not to mention the affair again, unless to those she could trust, and who might possess sufficient influence to serve him. The next morning, (for O'Halloran did not appear that night,) Mrs. Brown hastened to inform him of what she had heard respecting Edward's seizure by the United Irishmen. Her brother not only acknowledged that he knew of the fact, but had consented to it, and acquainted her at large with his reasons for so doing. He assured her, however, that the captive would be treated with kindness, and that his life was in no danger. Mrs. Brown, with more warmth than was usual to her, expressed her surprise and indignation of what had taken place. “What!” said she, “has my brother; he of whose honourable and noble course of conduct, I have hitherto been so proud; whose mind, I thought superior to the narrow, selfish motives that too often influence other men, become, at last, so forgetful of his long boasted rectitude, as to betray an unsuspecting youth, who was a stranger and his guest, into the power of those who hate him, and whose hatred to those who may be in their power, is almost equivalent to destruction?” “Mrs. Brown,” said O'Halloran, rising hastily, “I have not been accustomed to hear such language from you. I have already told you my reasons for my conduct. If they are insufficient to justify me in your eyes, it is of little consequence, since they do it in my own. In the meantime my regard for a woman's weakness, must not, shall not turn my attention from that duty, however stern it may be, which I owe to my country.” He then left the apartment; and Mrs. Brown, with a heavy heart, returned to sympathise with her niece. “Your grandfather has assured me,” said she, endeavouring to comfort her, “that no attempt M will be made upon his life, and that he shall experience no inconvenience in their power to prevent, except the loss of liberty.” Ellen's uncertainty respecting her lover's fate, being thus removed, the violence of her emotions gradually subsided, and was in a short time succeeded by a calm and settled melancholy. The liveliness and ingenuity of Miss Agnew, who soon discovered the cause of her friend's distress, greatly aided the unceasing tenderness and solicitude of Mrs. Brown, in assuaging the poignancy of Ellen's grief, and she was in a few weeks restored to a tolerable enjoyment of existence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. X. The hovering insect, thus complained; Am I then slighted and disdained? Can such offence your anger wake? 'Twas beauty caused the bold mistake; Those cherry lips that breathe perfume, That cheek so ripe in youthful bloom; Made me, with strong desire, pursue The fairest peach that ever grew. —Gay. Edward sustained his misfortunes with great spirit, and however severely he felt his being thus inclosed, as it were, in a living tomb, he took care that none around him should perceive the state of his feelings. The Rev. Mr. Porter, a presbyterian clergyman, at this time under cover from a threatened prosecution for high treason, was his most agreeable and constant companion. Mr. Samuel Nelson, whom we mentioned before, and who at this period was a very active agent of the United Directory, was a frequent visitor at the cavern; but not being under proscription by the government, he frequented it rather for the purpose of business than concealment. His arrival always excited great interest; for he never failed to bring with him a large assortment of news, and a budget of political documents for the inspection of his coadjutors. The Frenchman, whom we have also already mentioned, was a bustling, active sort of a character, who, on all occasions assumed an air of great importance, as being a citizen and a public, or (to speak more correctly,) a secret functionary of the Great nation; for at this period, the meanest officers of the new Gallic republic exhibited a desire of being thought superior to the people of every other country; and in all companies and controversies, arrogated a distinction and authority quite inconsistent with that natural equality among mankind, which they avowed as their favourite doctrine. But the enthusiasm excited by their military successes, and the boldness of their innovations, veiled all their faults from the eyes of the United Irishmen, and among many of the zealots of the day, any indecorum might have been justified by merely asserting it to be the French custom. From not being at first aware of this circumstance, Edward was greatly at a loss to imagine, how men of such improved minds and refined manners, as Porter, Nelson and O'Halloran, could tolerate the superciliousness and flippancy of their foreign guest; who would often, in the midst of the most serious natural discussion, interrupt the speaker by starting questions, or making observations the most frivolous and irrelevant to the subject. For the two first days of Edward's imprisonment, O'Halloran did not visit the cave. On the evening of the third, he entered with a bundle of letters and newspapers, which he handed to Nelson. Then going forward to Edward; “Mr. Middleton,” said he, “I am truly sorry that it is against your will you are here; and I hope that it will be soon otherwise. I request you will read this letter at your leisure, and seriously consider its contents.” He then seated himself at the table, and for about an hour joined his confederates in perusing the papers he had brought; after which he asked Nelson to accompany him to the castle, and they retired together. Immediately on receiving the letter, Edward withdrew to his sleeping closet, where throwing himself on his couch, he read as follows: “My young and esteemed friend, “In consenting to your confinement, I made a greater sacrifice of feeling to duty than I had ever been before called on to make. I had a hard struggle; but my conception of what I owed to the great national cause in which I am engaged, gained the victory. “Ever since I could lay down a plan of conduct for my life, I have graduated the scale of my duties in the following manner. The first is my duty to my God, the second to my country, the third to my neighbour, and the fourth to myself. It is my pride that I have hitherto acted in conformity to this scale; and I consider no instance of my doing so, a greater triumph of my principles over my feelings, than my resigning you to a captivity, which, I trust, will not be of long continuance. This latter circumstance will, however, depend altogether on yourself. Were we certain that the secrets connected with our cause, which have come to your knowledge, would be safe in your keeping, you should not be confined a single hour. But so long as you profess a disapprobation of our designs, it is manifest that, to permit your enlargement would be unwarrantably to subject ourselves and our cause to unnecessary dangers. “I do not write to you for the purpose of apologizing for my conduct. So long as that conduct has the approbation of my own conscience, I will apologize to no man. But I wish to represent the affair to you in its true light; and to assure you that you have no personal danger to apprehend, and that you shall suffer no personal hardship nor privation, that consistently with the precautionary views which have induced us to confine you, we can prevent. M 2 “When I say that the recovery of your liberty depends on yourself, I mean, that by evincing an attachment to our association, and by coming under the obligations we impose on its members, you will satisfy us that we run no risk from your disclosures, and you shall not only be immediately set at liberty, but gladly hailed as a brother, and raised to an honourable place in our esteem and confidence. “At present we make great allowances for the political principles in which you have been educated; but we trust, that you have good sense sufficient not to permit prejudice always to blind you to justice. For my own part, I am persuaded that you have liberality and discernment enough, provided you exercise them, to enable you to throw off the trammels of early impressions, when they will not stand the test of reason. You are an Irishman, and I believe you love your country, and wish her to be free and happy. I will ask you can she ever be so, under a government which derives all its authority and its impulses from a foreign country, absolutely inimical to her prosperity; and surely a country which looks upon ours as a conquered province, and is proud of the domination she exercises over us, can never be likely to grant us rights and privileges, to which, as human beings, we are entitled, and of which she herself has despoiled us. “I need not enlarge upon facts to convince you that Irishmen have nothing to expect from English generosity. You are, I doubt not, well enough conversant in the history of our British connexion to know that it has been pregnant with nothing but oppressions and calamities to our ancestors and ourselves. As an Irishman, as a lover of justice and of your country, you cannot but feel indignant at the usage she has ever received from that nation which has so long acted, not as her sister, but as her tyrant; and, if you feel indignant at the ages of unmerited and cruel sufferings, that your country has sustained, we call on you, in her name, to join with those who are resolved to deliver her from her oppressors, or perish in the attempt. “It is in vain for any one to say, that it is our own restless, discontented and riotous dispositions, that have caused our misfortunes, and that if we would live peaceably, we might live happily. Ah! sir, we have tried that. We long submitted, but even then we were not spared. We were forbidden to exert our industry, but in such a manner, and in the production of such articles alone as our neighbours pleased; while our commerce was confined to such channels as suited their interest. At their caprice, we were extravagantly taxed, while we were chained into poverty—while we were forbidden to improve the natural wealth and resources with which Providence has so bountifully blessed our island, in her soil, her climate, her minerals and her situation. Three-fourths of our population, were deprived of every political privilege, and are consequently, at this day, no better than slaves, compelled to passive and degrading submission to the will of their haughty and unfeeling masters. When we patiently submitted, our submission was considered want of spirit, and we were represented as being incapable of either understanding or relishing the blessings of liberty. We then petitioned and remonstrated, and were called seditious, and troublesome, and turbulent. Our petitions were only answered by mockery, and our remonstrances with threats; and, latterly, these threats have been wantonly converted into a malignant and cruel persecution. “The state of the times, I need not describe to you. That dreadful state has been caused by the tyrannical system of vengeance, which has been adopted to counteract the natural and justifiable exertions of an enlightened people to obtain from their oppressors their legitimate and unquestionable rights. On which side is the cause of justice, your own good sense will readily perceive; and which side has the greater claim upon your good will and services, as a patriot your sense of duty to the land that gave you birth will easily decide. “As one who esteems you and feels a high interest in your welfare, I exhort you to decide in favour of an injured and oppressed nation, which claims you as her son, and to whom alone your allegiance and fidelity are due. Reflect seriously on the subject, so that if your decision be in our favour, it may be the result of deliberate reasoning and true conviction. We shall then confide in you as our friend, and I shall have the happiness of regarding you as an Irishman worthy of the name. “I am, &amp;c. “HENRY O'HALLORAN.” To this letter, Edward wrote a very copious reply, from which the following passages are extracted. After assuring O'Halloran that he gave full credit to the motives which influenced him in consenting to his captivity, and, on that account, let its issue be what it would, he freely forgave him, he proceeded—“But as to your attempts to bring me over to your party, it will require considerations more powerful, and arguments more conclusive, than any you have advanced, or I am persuaded have in your power to advance, to be successful. I feel as much as any man for the misfortunes of my country, and it is this very feeling that prevents me from joining in measures which, I know, will only plunge her into deeper distress. “I need not, I presume, recall to the memory of a man of your historical knowledge, the origin of those laws of which the catholic part of our countrymen complain. Had James instead of William been the successful competitor for the crown of these kingdoms, I dare say, you will admit it to be probable, that the catholics would have guarded their religion by statutes, at least as strong and severe as the victorious protestants found it necessary to adopt. I need not inform you that in those countries, where the catholics did prevail—in France, Spain, Portugal, &amp;c. they have secured their own faith with infinitely more solicitude and zeal, than the people of Britain did theirs, for they have secured it to the total exclusion of all others. I will not speak of the use they have always made of power, whenever they happened to obtain it in these islands.—You know it well, and knowing it as you do, you and the other presbyterians who have lately espoused their cause, merit, at least, the praise of rendering good for evil, conduct which must for ever elicit respect and admiration, from every lover of generosity and magnanimity. I can, as much as any one, appreciate the liberality of such conduct; and would be no enemy to catholic emancipation, if brought about by legal means; for I am inclined to think that all the political privileges they desire, might now be granted to the Irish catholics with safety, nay, with advantage to the national prosperity. They are become more tolerant than their ancestors; and, I trust, that the age is too enlightened for religious animosity and fanaticism again to produce such a degree of human misery as they did in the days of the Tudors and the Stewarts. “You must acknowledge that since the expulsion of the last mentioned family from the throne, no man is punished in these kingdoms for conscience-sake. Even with respect to the civil disabilities, which the penal laws imposed on the catholics, they have, within the last half century, been considerably relieved from their effects; and by a proper and temperate perseverance in applying to the authority in whose hands the constitution lodges the power of redressing grievances, whatever yet remains of these laws, would undoubtedly be repealed, whenever it should appear that it could be done with safety. But I will appeal to the common sense of any man, if the present conduct of the disaffected in this island is likely to hasten that event? No; if the sword again must be used in defence of the laws and constitution of the country, I fear it will be thought necessary to make these laws stronger, perhaps severer than ever. God forbid that ever such a crisis should take place, but if it should, every unprejudiced man can perceive who are to blame for it. “With respect to the British jealousy of our prosperity, which you say has had the effect of shackling our commerce, and restraining our industry, I am of opinion, that, if fairly enquired into, it will be found to originate only in the imaginations of theorists, or the ambition of demagogues, who wish to disturb the public tranquillity. Why should Britain be averse to our prosperity? It would be directly contrary to her interests; for our prosperity is her prosperity, and our strength is her strength. As well might Middlesex oppose the prosperity of Lancashire, and the authorities of Edinburgh adopt measures to prevent the growth of Glasgow. The fact is, our trade, manufactures and capital, have more than doubled themselves within the last twenty years, and, were it not for the political broils that distract the country, it would, at the present moment, be more prosperous and happy than ever it was, during the whole course of its past history. Here, sir, you cannot deny that before the present discontents became so alarming, every peaceable industrious man had the safety of his person, property, and character well secured to him by known laws; and could sit down and call what he possessed his own, with more confidence under our government than under any other in Europe, or perhaps in the world. “You say that my country claims all my allegiance. I know it, sir, and I acknowledge it. But I cannot identify my country with that imprudent faction to which it grieves me to find you have so zealously attached yourself. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * I wish you to understand me clearly. I am opposed to despotism as much as I am opposed to anarchy itself. My politics are the politics of the whigs of 1688, who expelled despotism from the throne, and by placing in its stead a limited monarch, gave the last finish to our excellent constitution. “The abuses that have crept into our government, during the lapse of more than a century, I would endeavour to reform; but I would do it by legal means; and these, if properly persisted in, could not fail to be effectual. The corruptions of the constitution, I would purify, not by violence, desolation and blood-shed, remedies infinitely more dreadful than the disease has yet become, but by the means by which Grattan obtained our free trade and independent parliament, namely, parliamentary interference, which by persevering and energetic applications from the people will always be procured. When I say that my sentiments on these subjects were the sentiments of Hampden and Russel, Addison and Steel, Chatham and Fox, Charlemont and Grattan, you will hardly think them unfriendly to rational liberty, or unworthy of an Irishman. “To obtain my enlargement, I will come under no obligations that might by any possibility be ascribed to meanness or timidity. I should scorn to act the part of an informer, against either the misguided or the unfortunate—and, with respect to you individually, to whom I am under Providence indebted for life itself, gratitude binds me too strongly to your personal welfare, to permit me either inadvertently or intentionally, to divulge any part of your conduct, or of those connected with you, that might operate to your disadvantage * * * *. “Yours, &amp;c. “EDWARD MIDDLETON.” O'Halloran and his confederates finding that they could not shake Edward's political principles, desisted after this, from making the attempt. They also appeared more guarded when conversing in his presence, so that, during the remainder of the summer, he obtained very little information concerning the progress of their affairs. In the meantime, the Recluse being aware of the capricious and revengeful disposition of several of those who had access to his imprisoned friend, became every day more uneasy concerning him. With M`Nelvin, who also felt much on the subject, and who was his only confidant, he had frequent conferences on the practicability of procuring Edward's liberty, but they could devise no plan that seemed in the slightest degree to promise success. Ellen, by the assurances she received of his personal safety, and by the sympathy, and kind attentions of her aunt and Miss Agnew, became daily more resigned and cheerful, so that before the end of August, she was seen taking her usual evening walks, although it was observed that she generally walked alone, and as much as possible courted solitude. One evening, about this time, an incident took place which, as it had some connexion with those events which led to Edward's enlargement, should be related. Monsieur Monier, the French emissary already mentioned, had fallen desperately in love with her; and having obtained her grandfather's permission to address her, had added greatly to her affliction by persecuting her with his passion for several months past. He had been lately informed of her partiality for Edward; and in consequence began to hate him as the sole obstacle to his happiness. Edward had never esteemed this man, for independently of his criminal and disgraceful occupation, his manners were flippant, profane and arrogant, the very reverse of those he approved. In several conversations, the dissimilarity of their minds had been manifested, and on some occasions, they had taken but little pains to conceal their mutual dislike. Our Frenchman, therefore, cordially wished perdition to his rival. On the evening alluded to, he followed Ellen into one of her favourite and lonely walks, in a small wood that skirted the Volunteer ground. She was indulging her melancholy feelings in reading Burns's beautifully tender song of Highland Mary when Monier approached. He had just left the company of the gentlemen at the castle, among whom the social glass had circulated freely, and was a little heated with the liquor he had drunk. “I am right happy, right glad, mam'selle,” said he, “to meet with you here. This is a fine, lovely-looking place for a lover like me to meet her he loves better than all the world.” “Sir,” said Ellen, “I have often told you not to speak to me on such a subject. I now wish to be alone.—You will, therefore, be pleased to walk on N to wherever you were going, and leave me to myself.” “Beautiful creature, do you think I can leave you? I left my company and my wine to come after you.” “You did very wrong, sir; and I insist that you shall immediately return to your company and your wine, for whatever business you may have with them, I assure you, with me you can have none.” “Ah! my dear, with your bright eyes, with your lovely cheeks like the rose, and with your pretty bosom like the snow, I must have business. I am tired of politics, I now want to enjoy love.” “What do you mean, sir,” said she, “by thus pertinaciously obtruding yourself upon me, when I tell you that your company is unwelcome?” “Is my company unwelcome? Ah! I know somebody else, whose company you would prefer in this place.” “No matter what you know; only begone from me.” “Ah! my love, you should think how that man is in my power. He is my rival. I can be revenged. Only let me sit with you, and talk with you, and kiss your pretty hand, and he shall be used well.” “I say again, sir, begone! How dare you use such freedoms.” “It is only the way in France, mam'selle. I love you to my very soul, and I must kiss you and court you as lovers always do there.” “Your rudeness is intolerable!” “Ah! my angel, my passion is intolerable.” So saying he caught her very roughly. “O God of mercy! is there no one to help me?” exclaimed the terrified maiden. “Villain!” cried a loud, tremendous voice, “receive that for your infamous conduct to an angel” —and a tall stout man without a hat, or coat, and bald headed, struck him on the face with such force that he fell to the ground screaming, while the blood gushed freely from his mouth and nostrils. Ellen could not recognize the stranger. “Whoever you are,” said she, “may heaven bless you, for this deed!” “Take my arm, fair innocence! I will protect you home.” She did so, and without speaking, he conducted her to the public road which led to the castle. “You are now safe,” said he, “I must leave you.” “But first,” she replied, “let me know to whom I am indebted for this deliverance?” “There are people approaching,” he replied, “I must not be seen. Describe me to no one. Call with the Recluse to-morrow, at five in the afternoon. He will tell you who I am. But stop, stay—I see M`Nelvin, who knows me. He will conduct you to the castle.” The poet on seeing Ellen, was about to retire, but the stranger called him forward. “Protect this young lady to the castle,” said he, “ask her no questions; but return to me in an hour. I shall explain all.” So saying he disappeared, and M`Nelvin, with considerable embarrassment, offered Ellen his arm. “Oh! Mr. M`Nelvin,” said she, “I shall never forget that man. I hope heaven will reward him— methinks I should know his voice.” “He is a good man, Miss O'Halloran, and you may yet know him.” “You have that pleasure it seems.” “Yes, and that pleasure is the only antidote I have against sorrows that would otherwise destroy me.” “Your unhappiness, Mr. M`Nelvin, which I have long noticed, grieves me, for I know you deserve a better fate. Can nothing be done to remove the cause of your melancholy?” “No; nothing in this world,” he replied, with a sigh, “without rendering a dearer object than myself miserable.” They had now arrived at the castle, into which the poet declined entering. But before they parted, Ellen requested him to call the next day to accompany her to the Recluse's cavern, to which he consented. After much reflection on the Frenchman's misconduct, Ellen resolved not to reveal it to her friends. She recollected his threats against Edward, and she conceived, that by publishing his disgrace, she would only irritate his evil passions the more against his prisoner, and perhaps stimulate him to push his revenge even to assassination. At the appointed time, she accompanied M`Nelvin to the hermit's cave, at the door of which he left her, promising to return in an hour to conduct her back. She found the old man in his usual attire in his first apartment. He informed her that he was the person who had rescued her yesterday—that seeing the Frenchman following her in a state of intoxication, and knowing how she had been lately persecuted by him, he thought it prudent to remain convenient for her protection; but not wishing to be known to him as the Recluse, he threw off part of the disguise he had usually worn since he came into this neighbourhood. “Then you are not the decrepid, destitute old man we have hitherto taken you to be?” said she. “No;” he replied, “but I have strong reasons for wishing to appear so for some time. This is all I must discover to you at present; but, I hope the time will come when throwing off all mystery, I shall reveal myself fully to you and to the world. In the meantime, my daughter, when you want a friend, when you need a protector, fly here, repose confidence in me, and be assured you shall receive ready and sufficient succour. I know the secret of your heart with respect to the imprisoned stranger. Be not ashamed of it. He is worthy of your preference, and in thus encouraging you to love him, you will yet find that I give a sanction to your feelings, at which your reason will rejoice. Return home now, my daughter—I may call you such, for my chief wish on earth is to see you happy; and my greatest anxiety is to guard you against misfortune. May God bless you, and be you still as innocent and virtuous as you now are, and you will deserve his blessing.” “Thank you, father,” said she, “for you have spoke comfort to my soul. How shall I ever be able to repay such kindness?” “By nursing me on my death-bed,” he replied, “and shedding the tears of affection over my grave. Farewell! Visit me often.” At the door of the cave, she met the poet, who had been waiting there to conduct her home. Being thus assured of the disinterested attachment of two worthy persons, she became more cheerful in her mind, although her terror of the Frenchman was so great, that she resolved to discontinue those solitary rambles from which she had drawn so much enjoyment, least he should again find an opportunity to assault her.</field>

Her nature is all goodness to abuse, And causeless crimes continually to frame; With which she guiltless persons may accuse, And steal away the crown of their good name; Never a knight so hold, and never dame So chaste or loyal lived, but she would strive, With forged cause them falsely to defame. Spencer. As nothing material happened to either our hero or heroine for some weeks after this period, I shall, if my reader has no objection, take advantage of this paucity of events to inform him what became of Tom Mullins and his companion. It will be recollected that Tom Mullins, Edward's servant, set off in company with our gallant Northern peasant, Jemmy Hunter, in obedience to his master's orders, to avoid the violence of some enraged United Irishmen, who had combined against him. They rode that day, through a lovely and highly cultivated country as far as the town of Antrim, without meeting with any adventures worth relating. Here they consulted their instructions, and found that they were to remain there for two days in expectation of Edward overtaking them, at the expiration of which time, if he did not arrive they were to proceed to the seat of Sir Philip Martin in the county of Tyrone, who was a relation and a confidant of the Recluse, and whose son having been Edward's fellow-student at Trinity College, he had resolved to visit on his return homeward. They had also a letter from Edward to the Earl O`Neil, whose castle lay on the way from Antrim to Sir Philip Martin's residence. On the evening of their second night at Antrim, as they were sitting comfortably over a mug of ale, two soldiers belonging to a regiment of fencibles that then lay in the town, and a townsman, came into the room. On hearing Mullin's brogue, and the simplicity of some of his remarks, one of the soldiers who was a Scotchman, and possessed of more mirth than good manners, thought to enjoy a little diversion at his expense. Accordingly, mimicking his tone of voice as well as he could, he approached him, saying, “Arrah, my friend Paddy, and where did yourself come from?” Tom, however, had more mettle than he expected; and although he wished not to give offence, he replied, “I'll tell you, friend, whenever you are asked, just say I came from Kilkenny, where I dont believe in my shoul that your father was hanged, though he might have been put in the stocks for impertinence.” “What! heigh, ho!” replied the Scotchman somewhat nettled—“you maun either be a damn'd crappy, or what is worse, a damn'd papist.” “Lord! I doubt you're a warlack,” said Hunter, eyeing him contemptuously, “you can guess sae weel.” “Be it sae,” said the Scot, whom wrath had now reduced to his national accent, “ye'll please awa' to the guard hoose, whar weel hae you examined, an' taucht hoo to gie a ceevil answer.” “By the L—d!” said Hunter, “you maun show your warrant, ere we stir wi' you.” “The king's uniform is oor warrant,” said the fencible, “didna ye confess ye war crappies.” “Confess the devil,” said Hunter, “if ye dont leave the room this moment, ye'll no' leave it the next-wi' a hale skin.” “What do you mean? you rascal,” cried the other fencible, “do you mean to strike one of the king's soldiers? Prepare to march!” So saying both the soldiers drew their bayonets, and swore that they would “gut them like herrings” if they did not accompany them immediately to the guard-house. The landlord now entered, and having enquired into the cause of the disturbance, he advised our travellers to go with the soldiers, assuring them that if they could justify themselves before the officers at the guard-house, they would be instantly dismissed. Hunter swore he would not stir until absolute force should be used, or some lawful warrant for seizing him produced. An officer happening to pass at this moment, the landlord called him in. On hearing the soldiers' statement, he ordered the travellers to the guard-house without waiting for their reply. Seeing it in vain to resist longer, they complied, and in less than an hour, were both convicted by a court-martial of being United Irishmen, and attempting to abuse two privates belonging to his majesty's regiment of Fifeshire Fencibles. They were each sentenced to receive five hundred lashes the next morning. The townsman who had entered the room with the soldiers, and had been an observer of the whole affray, was, although a zealous kingsman, so much struck with the iniquity of these proceedings, that he resolved, if possible, to set the affair in its true light. He therefore took an opportunity of enquiring of Hunter, whether he was known to any gentleman in the neighbourhood who could have influence enough to procure a re-hearing of the case, offering to give such evidence of the affair as would entirely exculpate the prisoners. Hunter was unknown to any man of property in the vicinity; but, he said, that he had a letter from a gentleman, on whose business he and his companion, who was that gentleman's servant, were then travelling, for lord O`Neil, who perhaps on their employer's account, might interfere in their behalf. “He is just the man that can save you,” said Thompson, which was the name of their new friend. “Give me the letter. I will carry it to his lordship, and tell him the whole truth. I know him well. He is my landlord, and a good man. He procured for me the office of guager in this town.” Without delay Thompson proceeded to Shanes Castle, long the stately and venerable seat of the O`Neil family, situated on the border of Lough Neagh, about two miles from Antrim, with the letter for its noble owner. His lordship on hearing the circumstances, and on reading the letter, immediately ordered his horse, and set off for the town with Thompson. He called on the commanding officer, and having told him that he would pledge himself for the loyalty of the two strangers, who were then under sentence to be flogged, desired that they should have the benefit of a new trial, as he had sufficient evidence to prove their innocence. “Whatever your lordship wishes in this affair,” said the officer, “shall be done.” A new trial was accordingly ordered, at which his lordship, as colonel of the Antrim militia, was invited to preside. The soldiers testified as they did before, that the prisoners had confessed themselves to be United Irishmen, and that they had threatened violence to the deponents who in their own defence were forced to draw their side arms. Lord O'Neil then enquired if there was no other witness, and was answered that no other had been examined on the last trial. That there had been one Thompson present during the quarrel; but, in such cases, they considered two witnesses sufficient to establish the guilt, and had not therefore examined him. His lordship desired Thompson to be called, who correctly stated to the court the facts as they happened. His lordship then mentioned that he had strong collateral evidence in favour of the prisoners, evidence indeed which went to prove that these men, so far from being conspirators against his Majesty's government, were, at the moment of their apprehension, actually flying from the threatened vengeance of a party of United Irishmen, whom they had offended by refusing to join their society. “Here is a letter which I received,” said he, “from a son of the honourable Thomas Barrymore, and a nephew to the earl of Barrymore, one of his Majesty's privy counsellors, a young gentleman with whose principles and integrity I am well acquainted, in which letter he states that his servant, Thomas Mullins, having had a political quarrel in the town of Larne with some United Irishmen, they laid in wait for him, and would have killed him, had not his companion, James Hunter, come to his rescue, and succeeded in beating off the villains. He states further, that his business not permitting him immediately to leave that place, and fearing that the conspirators might renew their attempts against his servant, he has prevailed on Hunter to accompany him to the seat of his friend, Sir Philip Martin, in the county of Tyrone, and as they should pass by Shanes Castle, he took that opportunity of recommending them to my protection, in case any accident might befall them in my neighbourhood. Gentlemen,” his lordship continued, “after this statement, corroborative of the positive and direct testimony of Thompson, I need not enlarge on the injustice of the proceedings that have taken place, and which, I perceive, have altogether arisen from the misconduct and malignity of two private soldiers, who to gratify their revenge on these innocent men, have not scrupled to become guilty of perjury, and upon their oaths wilfully to deceive this court. The testimony of Thompson, who joined neither party in the quarrel, may be safely considered impartial, and correct; and, as the matter now stands, I should suppose that no officer here will hesitate to concur in acquitting the prisoners. I also hope that the incident will impress on the minds of all present, the necessity of receiving at all times, with extreme caution, the evidence of men whose feelings are interested in procuring the conviction of prisoners, which is generally the case with informers, and of such as, in times like these, officiously display a more than ordinary zeal as partisans even in a good cause. I would therefore recommend it to the court both from a regard to justice, and as an example to malicious persons, to inflict a suitable punishment for perjury on the men who have been the occasion of this disgraceful business.” The court acceded to his lordship's wishes. The prisoners were dismissed; and the two soldiers ordered to receive each one hundred lashes. Thus did our travellers escape from the unpleasant predicament, into which their evil stars had involved them. But it is impossible not to perceive that this military court was induced to do them justice, not so much from the merits of their case, as from a desire to oblige a man possessed of a title, of twenty-five thousand pounds a year, and of unlimited influence with the ministers of the day. Under the auspices of this great man, they arrived without further accident, at the place of their destination, where Hunter left his charge, and returned home in safety, about three weeks after his departure, to the great joy of all his kindred and acquaintances, but to none more than the sweet Peggy Caldwell, whom he vowed never to leave so long again until they became “man an' wife.” Sir Philip Martin, to whom the Recluse had written concerning Edward's detention, being a favourer of the United Irishmen, and having by inquiries from O'Halloran, satisfied himself that his life was in no danger, refrained from acquainting his friends with the circumstance. Lord O'Neil was ignorant of it; consequently, to Edward's relations, who had become uneasy at his long and silent absence, and had begun to make some inquiry after him, he could give no other information, than that he had received a letter from him in the month of May last, at which period he was in the vicinity of Larne. Edward had written to his friends shortly after coming to the North, that he intended, before he returned home, to visit the island of Staffa, and some other places in the Highlands. It was, therefore, concluded that he was exploring some of the remote parts of that wild, but to a mind like Edward's, attractive portion of the empire, from whence transmitting communications by letter they knew to be rather difficult and uncertain. They, therefore, thought proper for a time to cease their inquiries after him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XII. —Old men and beldames in the street, Do prophecy upon it dangerously: Yourg Arthur's death is common in their mouths, And when they talk of him, they shake their heads, And whisper one another in the ear. And he that speaks doth grip the hearer's wrist, Whilst he that hears him makes most fearful action, With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes. Shakspeare. It was in the autumn of 1797, and sometime after the preceding transactions, that the melancholy event took place, which severed the last remaining link of the chain which had hitherto bound thousands of the presbyterian community in the North, to the side of government, and gave that impulse to the wheels of the conspiracy, which no subsequent measure of either policy or force could arrest until it terminated in the fury and vengeance of a sanguinary rebellion. This event was the death, or, as the popular voice termed it, the martyrdom of William Orr. To give a minute account of the sufferings of this greatly lamented favourite of the people, would interfere too much with the main design of this history; but his fate was too closely interwoven with, and had too important an influence on many transactions, which it will be incumbent on us to relate, to permit us to pass it over in silence. Indeed the reader could but little appreciate those feelings, which hurried the presbyterians of Ulster into the disastrous enterprise of 1798, unless he knew something of the story of Orr. As a body, whether we consider their numbers, or their intelligence, O their wealth, their habits of industrious and active perseverance in their designs, they were by far the most efficiently powerful class of the conspirators. The majority of them, however, until the time of Orr's catastrophe, were far from being disloyal. They were indeed greatly dissatisfied with the recent measures of the administration; but they could have been easily conciliated, for it was no trifling matter, that could totally estrange their hearts from that government, which had been the constant bulwark of the reformation. They might, and did occasionally feel some jealousy of the peculiar privileges and endowments, enjoyed by a prelatic church establishment; but they never viewed that establishment with the discontent and animosity which was felt by the catholics; and with respect to their ideas of civil liberty they had been, generally speaking, strictly constitutional. Many of them had of late years, from a feeling of justice, warmly espoused the cause of catholic emancipation; and when by the sagacious managers of the United confederacy, that cause became coupled with the cause of parliamentary reform, which was the great object of their political wishes, they scarcely made any difference in the zeal with which they sought the attainment of both. Still a great majority of even those among them, who had joined the United Irishmen, did not aim at a total dissolution of their connexion with Britain, notwithstanding their leaders, ever since the passing of the Insurrection law, did not hesitate to avow that such a dissolution was the great object for which they contended. Even to this period, thousands, whose political views coincided with those originally professed by the conspirators, had refused to join them, but their reluctance now vanished before the awful and exasperating spectacle of a virtuous, inoffensive, industrious and respectable man, vindictively hurried to the gallows in the face of circumstances absolutely demonstrative of his innocence; in contempt of the most earnest recommendations of a repentant jury, to mercy; and in opposition to the wishes, the expectations and the prayers of multitudes of all classes of the community. After a year's wearisome imprisonment, this victim of executive infatuation and resentment, was brought to trial in September 1797, on a charge of administering the oath of a United Irishmen to a Scotch soldier of the name of Wheatly, an act which a clause in the Insurrection law had rendered punishable with death. On the evidence of Wheatly, he was convicted, and sentence of death passed upon him. So notoriously bad, however, was the informer's character, that several of the jury were prevailed on to agree to the verdict, only by the cajolement and intimidation practised by others, and on the express condition that they should all join in a recommendation to mercy. This recommendation was forwarded to the Viceroy, together with the affidavits of three of the jurors, stating their solemn belief of the prisoner's innocence, and confessing that they were under the influence of intoxication and terror when they concurred in the verdict. The reader will be astonished at this confession of intoxication, it being a direct infringement of the British law which enjoins abstinence on jurors during the solemn period of their deliberations: but it is a fact, that the jurors alluded to, swore positively to the introduction of spirituous liquor through a window into their chamber, and that they had used it to inebriation. The day after the trial the informer also became conscience-struck, and voluntarily deposed that his testimony against Orr had been malicious and untrue. Exertions were, therefore, made by the magistrate who had originally committed Orr upon the soldier's information, and by many other respectable gentlemen of the county, to save him. He was, in consequence, three times respited, and great hopes were entertained that he should finally receive mercy. During this interval of suspense, a slanderous and unjust paragraph made its way into a Belfast newspaper, stating that Orr had made a confession of his guilt, and an acknowledgment of the justice of his sentence, “which (it was added) he had done to ease his conscience, and acquit the jury who had been calumniated for their verdict against him.” To repel this ungenerous fabrication, Mr. Orr despatched his brother to Dublin with the following letter; which was delivered to the lord lieutenant. “May it please your excellency— “Having received from your excellency's clemency, that respite from death which affords me the opportunity of humbly and sincerely thanking you, I avail myself of the indulgence of pen and paper, and of that goodness you have already manifested towards me, to contradict a most cruel and injurious publication in a late newspaper, stating that I had confessed myself guilty of the crimes which a perjured wretch came forward to swear against me. My lord, it is not by the confession of crimes which would render me unfit for society, that I expect to live; it is upon the strength of that innocence which I will boldly maintain with my last breath, which I have already affirmed in a declaration, which I thought was to have been my last, and which I had directed to be published as my vindication from infamy, ten times more terrible to me than death. “I know my lord, that my own unhappy situation, the anguish of a distracted wife, the mistaken tenderness of an affectionate brother, have been resorted to, to procure that confession, and I was given to understand that my life would have been spared on such conditions. I as decidedly refused as I should do now, though your excellency's pardon was to be the reward. Judge then, my lord, of the situation of a man to whom life was offered, upon no other condition than that of betraying himself, by a confession both false and base. “And lastly, let me make one humble observation to your excellency, that the evidence should be strong indeed to induce conviction, that an industrious man, enjoying both comfort and competence; who had lived all his life in one neighbourhood; whose character, as well as that of all his stock, has been free from reproach of any kind; who certainly, if allowed to say so much for himself, would not shed the blood of any human creature; who is a husband and the father of a family; would engage himself with a common soldier, in any system that had for its end robbery, murder and destruction—for such was the evidence of the witness Wheatly. “If upon these grounds, and the facts already submitted to your excellency, I am to be pardoned, I shall not fail to maintain the most dutiful sense of gratitude for that act of justice as well as mercy; and in the meantime, I beg to remain your excellency's most obedient humble servant, “WILLIAM ORR.” Carrickfergus Jail, October 10th, 1797. At this period also Mrs. Orr addressed lady Camden in the following terms:— “To her Excellency the Countess of Camden.—For O 2 this freedom, grief like mine thinks not of apology. Despair and sorrow are my only companions; yet hope bids me look up to you for happiness. A miserable object, a mother and a wife, comes praying for mercy for the father of her children. “Pardon, most gracious lady, the frenzy of a distracted woman, and listen to the petition of the miserable wife of the unfortunate William Orr. I come a suppliant, a low and humble slave of misery, praying your ladyship's intercession in behalf of the life of my husband, whose existence is dearer to me than my own. O hear my complaint, and grant one beam of hope to my frantic imagination. You are the only person who has it in her power to remove never-ending misery from a wretched individual; to cheer the afflicted heart, and give comfort and consolation to her that was ready to perish. Suffer me to assure you that he is innocent of the crime for which he is under sentence of death. O cruel sentence! that will, without your interference, tear me from my husband, and rob my five poor little unoffending children of their father—the best of fathers, the kindest and dearest that ever lived. They join in solicitation for his life; their innocent, fervent, grateful prayers, will rise as a memorial before the throne of God; their lisping tongues shall be taught, with unceasing gratitude, to bless and adore the noble and generous, exalted character of their benefactress, the revered and loved countess of Camden. How will that name be printed upon their souls never to be effaced! Forgive my importunity—the life of my husband, the father of my children, is at stake. Despair has almost made me mad. I call upon you to exert yourself to save his life. Thy God will reward, thy country will thank thee, his children will bless thee, if thou grantest my petition; and when length of years, and increase of horror shall make thee tired of earthly joys, and the curtain of death shall gently close around thy bed, may the angels of God descend and take care that the last ray of thy existence shall not receive one rude blast to hasten its extinction. At that awful period, may the recollection of your successful interference, added to the prospect of your future felicity * * * * * * * * * * *.” The eyes of the whole community were fixed upon these transactions, and public anxiety was strained to the uttermost respecting the fate of the prisoner. The last respite was to terminate on the 14th of October, on the evening preceding which day, a messenger arrived from government to the high sheriff of the county. It was fondly hoped and confidently expected, that he was the messenger of mercy; but no; he brought the mandate of death—a death which snapped asunder every lingering tie by which the government had yet any hold on the affections of wavering thousands. The shock which was given to the public mind is not easy to be conceived—multitudes swore that oath of vengeance, which was afterwards but too fatally performed. On the morning of the 14th of October, he was taken from the jail. Although his long confinement had diminished the glow of health which his countenance had formerly worn, still it retained a more than ordinary degree of comeliness. His person was dignified and graceful, his stature being fully six feet, and his whole deportment such as to make a favourable and lasting impression on the spectators. As to his private character, a very candid writer of that day, who knew him well, observes that among his neighbours he was universally beloved, and in his domestic relations, as a husband, and a father, his affection and tenderness may have been equalled, but never surpassed. At one o'clock he arrived at the place of execution, on the sea shore, about a mile to the south of Carrickfergus, in a carriage, accompanied with two clergymen, whom he had selected for the occasion. He was escorted by a strong guard of horse, foot and artillery, detached from various regiments lying at Carrickfergus and Belfast. At the fatal spot, he sung some verses of the 23d and 35th Psalms. On the 4th verse of the former, Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale, Yet will I fear no ill; For thou art with me, &amp;c. he dwelt with particular emphasis; and also upon the following passage of the 14th chapter of Corinthians. “So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruptible, and this mortality shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory?” He then addressed the by-standers, for several minutes, and boldly and earnestly declared his innocence and the falsehood of his accusers; after which he shook hands with those friends who were convenient to him, and ascended the scaffold with a firm step. When the executioner had fixed the rope about his neck, he, for the first time, exhibited some symptoms of indignation, exclaiming, “I am no traitor; I am persecuted for a persecuted country. Great Jehovah receive my soul! I die in the true faith of a presbyterian.” He then gave the pre-concerted signal with his handkerchief, and was launched into eternity. Thus was accomplished a deed, the very mention of which, to this day, makes the blood of indignation boil in the hearts of thousands of Irishmen, even of those who are in reality friends to the constitution, and to the general conduct of the government as it has been administered since the Union. Had the administration of that day, singled out some restless, disorganizing and dangerous demagogue, some profligate disseminator of the new-fangled French doctrines of deism and equality, or the perpetrator of some act of violence or fraud, as the victim of its vengeful policy, the sensation of wrath, the passion of revenge, which seized upon, and maddened in the minds of the people, would either never have existed, or had they existed, being less defensible, would have evaporated whenever the subsiding of the first incitement of vexation and rage permitted the return of reflection. But unfortunately Orr was not a character either dissolute or dangerous, and consequently reflection in the public mind, only gave permanence to those revengeful passions to which exasperation had given origin. To show the impression of Orr's mind on the subject of religion, a subject on which no man who has sincere and solemn impressions, can be a bad member of society, the reader is here presented with a farewell letter, which he wrote to his wife shortly before he left the jail for the last fatal scene. “Carrickfergus, Saturday morning, Oct. 14. “MY DEAR WIFE. “I now think it proper to mention the grounds of my present encouragement, under the apprehension of shortly appearing before my God and Redeemer. First, my entire innocence of the crime I am charged with. Secondly, a well-grounded hope of meeting a merciful God. Thirdly, a firm confidence that that God will be a husband to you, and a father to our little children, whom I do recommend to his divine care and protection. And my last request is, that you will bring them up in the knowledge of that religion, which is the ground of my present comfort, and the foundation of that happiness, which, I trust, I shall enjoy on that day, when we must all appear before the great Judge. “Farewell, my dear wife! farewell. “WILLIAM ORR.” It will be readily supposed that the United chiefs, who frequented the cave in which Edward Barrymore was confined, partook largely of the public excitement on this occasion. As their designs, however, were far from being ripe for execution, they had the prudence to suppress their feelings, and to act with moderation; and were, also, at considerable pains to restrain the popular fury from breaking out prematurely into acts of violence. In consequence of this solicitude to prevent atrocities that would have been detrimental to their cause, they preserved the jury that had convicted Orr, from becoming victims to the fury of some of the more daring and fanatical of their party, who had denounced vengeance against them. One evening as Porter and Nelson were discoursing on this subject in Edward's presence, in such a manner as almost compelled him to express his opinion, he remarked that it was neither his province nor his inclination to defend the executive authority on all occasions. “It is not necessary,” said he, “that an adherent of our admirable form of government, should defend the general management of any particular administration, much less approve of any isolated act of harshness or cruelty. Still, however, before I can agree to consign the present ministers altogether to infamy, I must know the motives which induced them to permit this unhappy execution. False representations of the case, may have been made to them. They may have been persuaded that Orr was actually guilty of seducing the soldier from his allegiance, and therefore wished by a severe example to deter others from such practices. But, gentlemen, be my opinions on this subject what they may, I cannot help expressing my sorrow for the calamities which I perceive accumulating on the country, and which it is my sincere conviction, have had their origin in the unjustifiable and illegal attempts of secret associations to overawe the established authorities into measures, the beneficial tendency of which is, to say the least of it, controvertible.” “Sir,” said Nelson, “though we dislike your sentiments, we cannot but admire the candour with which you express them; nor can we be offended at your freedom of speech, since an avowed antagonist is a much safer companion than a treacherous colleague.” The conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of O'Halloran, with a bundle of letters, one of which he handed to Nelson, saying, “here is bad news for you. They have done what I long since predicted they would sometime do.” The transaction to which he alluded, will be related in the next chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XIII. Meantime fell faction had arrayed her host, And taught their angry tongues to rave and boast; With madd'ning draughts inflamed the phrenzied brain, Reason retired, and passion seized the rein; In the dark alley, first her line she formed, Already fancy saw the bulwark stormed, From thence she led the armed to vulgar fight, To crush that press so hateful to their sight; Before the dome she ranged that savage crowd, And urged them on with yells and curses loud. William Liegh Pierce. When Nelson had finished reading the letter O'Halloran had given him, he exclaimed! “Yes, our Star is, indeed, set; but I trust that the light it has diffused through the country will not be so easily extinguished. Since the press is not now permitted to tell our injuries, we must speak them with the trumpet; and since we cannot write for the public good, nothing remains but to fight for it.” “What new atrocity has taken place? if I may be permitted to ask,” said the Reverend Mr. Porter, who was at that moment preparing a communication for “the Northern Star,” in continuation of several ingenious letters, entitled, “Billy Bluff and Squire Firebrand,” with which he had lately amused and very much excited the minds of the people of Ulster. “You may throw your manuscript aside,” replied Nelson,” till better times. Barber's infamous dragoons have broken into my house, and destroyed our press. There is a letter from Teeling who witnessed the transaction. You may read it aloud. There will be no harm in Mr. Middleton hearing of another piece of tyranny—a ferocious outrage upon the liberty of the press, committed by a government which some men would make us believe is the grand protector of that liberty.” “Gentlemen,” observed Edward, “I have said before, that an attachment to our form of government does not involve a necessity to defend every act of its administration. Some administrations may be very corrupt; nay, some acts of even a virtuous administration may be very injudicious and improper. But the constitution contains within itself a healing principle, for all mistakes or abuses, by lodging the legislative power with the representatives of the people, and giving them authority to impeach and punish a vicious ministry. The faults, therefore, of our present ministers whatever they may be, it is neither my province nor my wish to vindicate.—With regard to the injury they may have done Mr. Nelson, for I perceive that they are charged with having made an attack upon his property, I do not know the merits of the case. But since you have drawn my attention to it, I shall listen to the statement you have received, provided I shall not be urged to give an opinion on it, should I wish to be silent.” He was informed that after hearing the particulars, he might remain silent or not, as he thought proper. The clergyman then read the letter aloud as follows: “Belfast, October — 1797. “DEAR SIR, “A dreadful scene of confusion and disaster has taken place here this morning. The vengeance of our tyrannic rulers has, at length, burst upon us, and our printing establishment is totally destroyed. P I will detail to you the facts, as concisely as the nature of the affair will admit. “At about ten o'clock this morning, while I was sitting in the Star office, preparing some editorial matter for our next publication, I was alarmed by an unexpected noise of horses prancing, accompanied by a loud confusion of human voices in the yard below. Immediately one of the clerks rushed into the office, and begged me to escape as fast as possible, for the dragoons were swearing vengeance against me. I had scarcely disappeared by the back passage, before the office door was burst open, and in my retreat I could hear them exclaiming, “Damn the rascal! where is he? Ferret him out, and send him to hell!” “Every desk, draw, trunk and locker was broken open; and all our papers, books, &amp;c. either destroyed or carried off. They beat and abused all our clerks and workmen on whom they could lay their hands. Fortunately, most of them escaped; and I am happy to understand that none of those who were seized are dangerously hurt. The windows and doors of the house were soon broken, and all our furniture, printing cases, presses, &amp;c. hewn in pieces, and thrown into the streets. Our types are all ruined, and it is said, that several of these Vandals proposed to set fire to the premises. This was, however, opposed by some more moderate than the rest, otherwise not only we, but numbers of our neighbours, would have suffered an immense destruction of property. “It appears that the party who made the attack, had just returned from a scouring expedition round the country; and, it is said, that they made it in revenge for some observations we had published upon certain atrocities they had committed, and without authority even from their officers, much less from any civil magistrate. But the result will show whether there was any secret understanding between them and the constituted authorities. It is certain that it was nearly 12 o'clock before either the magistrates or the officers could be prevailed on to interfere, and long before that period, the destruction of our printing establishment was completed. “They then proceeded to the houses of several of our friends, and broke their doors and windows, or demolished their signboards; and, with the most infuriated madness, stimulated by drunkenness, they galloped through the principal streets, terrifying even those most devoted to the interests of government. At length the town sovereign and several other magistrates, prevailed on colonel Barber to order them into the barracks. “Thus in the most licentious and illegal manner has our establishment and property been destroyed; and it is more than probable that not one of the depredators will be called to an account for it. It is indeed strongly suspected that the rioters would not have committed such an open outrage against the common laws of the land, unless they had been previously assured that they had no punishment to dread. “I had some thoughts of lodging examinations against one or two of them whom our chief clerk can identify upon oath; but shall adopt no measure of the kind until I hear from you. “To comment to you on this worse than Gothic outrage would be unnecessary; but I may express my own feelings on the subject. They are partly those of grief and resentment; and partly of gratification. Why I should feel the former is obvious; but why I should feel the latter may require explanation. It arises from a conviction that this act of violence will do more to render our oppressors obnoxious to the intelligent part of the community than any they have yet committed. It will prove the truth of what we have often advanced, that under our present rulers the conductors of a free press cannot perform their duty to the public without danger; and that an editor who possesses sufficient integrity to despise the bribes, and sufficient intrepidity to defy the threats of the government, will sooner or later feel the weight of its resentment; and I rejoice, since we have been marked out for vengeance, that it has been inflicted in this violent and illegal manner, which will excite the public sympathy towards us, and abhorrence towards our enemies, rather than by the more formal mockery of a law process, the issue of which, however unjust, would not have been so apparently flagitious to every part of the community. “I transmit this letter with some other documents I have just received from Dublin, by express. Mrs. Nelson and family are well, and have exerted more courage on this occasion than could have been expected. “Yours, &amp;c. “LUKE TEELING.” “Concerning this outrage,” said Edward, “I will give my opinion frankly and unsolicited. It is an instance of military violence which no rational, honest man can justify; and which it is the duty of the government severely and promptly to punish.” “I know the present government too well,” replied Nelson, “to expect justice from it. Irishmen have been often and long the deceived satellites of Britain; but, thank God, our eyes are now opened. Their professions can no longer deceive us; for we know exactly the degree of credit to which they are entitled. Now, if we want justice we must take it. Of our power to do so, our oppressors will soon be convinced. They will, no doubt, oppose us with fire and sword. The struggle will be dreadful, for the hatred is deadly; but the issue will be glorious. To prepare the minds of my countrymen for the great crisis of their national fate, I have already sacrificed my property; and my life, which is all I can now give, is ready to be yielded, whenever my country's benefit requires it.” “I am impatient for the day of action, that we may rid this long suffering land of the tyrants,” said O'Halloran. “Every day produces fresh atrocities, and adds to our sufferings and their insolence. Delay may increase their strength. It can scarcely add to ours, for we are already, in numbers, sufficiently strong. Why should we tamely continue to suffer? Why not hasten the day of our deliverance? The people are now animated and zealous. Orr has not died in vain!” “Mr. O'Halloran,” replied Porter, “prudence requires that we should exercise patience a few months longer. Although I acknowledge that delay by giving the government time to prepare for the struggle, which it now evidently expects, and, perhaps, by exposing some of our plans to discovery, may strengthen the hands of our adversaries, yet, as our adherents, however zealous and numerous, are not properly organized for insurrection, and the foreign aid we are promised, is not expected before spring, our wiser policy is to recommend our friends to a temporary submission to their misfortunes, rather than risk the ruin of their cause by a premature effort.” “Your reasoning may be correct,” said O'Halloran, “but it is hard to remain inactive, and see an unoffending populace becoming every day more and more the victims of a wanton and cruel tyranny.” P 2 “We may be active,” observed Nelson, “but we must be cautious. Were we, at present, to make the attempt, as we are not prepared to act in concert, the chance would be much against us. The day of retribution will come, and when we strike the blow, if it should be slow, I should like it to be sure.” “I know you are right,” said O'Halloran. “My feelings, not my judgment, would hurry me into premature action. But it must not be. Necessity, hard necessity, requires that we should, for another season yet, submit to be slaves. But, I trust, that it will make our deliverance the more certain and effectual. In the meantime, Mr. Nelson, you will accompany me to the castle. Mr. Porter will examine these papers from the Directory, and tomorrow we may consult about the reply.” During the foregoing conversation, Edward's mind, as will readily be supposed, was but ill at case. He felt no inclination to engage in it, and when O'Halloran and Nelson withdrew, he retired to his closet, there to ruminate with a heavy heart, on the rashness and misfortunes of these infatuated men, and to deplore the folly of that misgovernment which had driven them to the adoption of their desperate schemes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XIV. Fair was the from that o'er him hung, And fair the form that set him free; The trembling whispers of her tongue, Sweeter than Seraph's melody. Hogg. The rancour and hatred which Monsieur Monier bore towards Edward, broke out in several instances of spleen and ill nature, and tended not a little, to make his imprisonment become daily more and more irksome. He publicly declared his hatred to the chiefs of the conspiracy, and insisted that such an enemy to the rights of man, and the liberties of his country, should not be permitted to live. “If he were in France,” said he, “our sans-culottes would soon have him to the guillotine; for there we know how to get rid of the enemies of the people.” O'Halloran, and the other leaders, however, resisted all his importunities, and he could procure none of the lower orders to assassinate his rival, as their chiefs were so averse to it. He, at length, fell upon another scheme of getting him out of the way. A brig freighted and cleared out of Belfast as if bound for London, but in reality intended for some French port, with dispatches from the United Irish Directory, to the Republican Government, lay in the adjoining harbour. The insidious Frenchman meditated on having Edward carried on board of her, and despatched as a prisoner to France, where he could more easily controul his fate. But even this, he could not effect without the consent of the leaders. He, therefore, applied himself to Porter, who most usually resided in the cave. This gentleman, conceiving that the principal intention of Edward's imprisonment would be answered by this means, and his life at the same time secured from any sudden impulse of resentment among his enemies, a circumstance which, while he was in their custody, could never be certain, consented, and, at last, prevailed on O'Halloran also to consent. The Frenchman having thus far succeeded, immediately had the night fixed and the men selected for carrying him on board. It happened, however, that M`Nelvin, the poet, became accidentally acquainted with this plot. It was on an afternoon, towards the latter end of October, that he had thrown himself down amidst a thicket, a few paces from his arbour on the hill, with a small volume of Shakspeare's plays in his hand. His mind was absorbed in the romantic adventures of the Mid-Summer's Night's Dream, when he was startled by the sounds of voices approaching him. On looking from his thicket, he perceived the Frenchman, and Darragh, the man who had attempted Tom Mullin's life, advancing slowly. He lay quiet. When only a few yards from him, they stopped; but he was closely concealed from their view. “They have consented at last,” said the Frenchman, “to let that fair-faced orangeman be sent to France; but I wish to Jupiter, that he could be put out of the way before he arrives there; for I understand that one cannot now get whomsoever one hates sent to the guillotine for the good of the people, as it was in the glorious days of Robespierre, when the Mountain party ruled. Our directors are now become so puny-hearted, and so full of sentiment, that they too make some fuss about a man's life, although he should be denounced in the name of the people. I am, when I think of it, somewhat afraid to trust him alive there. He might get exchanged, come home, and then disclose all. We must be more cautious than to let him off alive, say what they will about it. I have a purse of twenty guineas, and a captain's commission, to bestow on the brave man who will kill this damned heretic and lover of crowned heads.” “Jack Lafferty, and I,” replied Darragh, “will do it. But not for your money. We'll do it for the good of the cause. When is he to go on board?” “There are six men appointed to convey him on board to-morrow night,” answered the Frenchman. “To-morrow all the country will gather to dig Robbin M`Brim's potatoes,” said Darragh. “Robbin has been in jail these three months. He is a true fellow. He would not tell who put him up, all that they could do with him, although they swore they would hang him, like Orr. Long life to him! say I. We have shorn his corn already, and will dig his potatoes in rank and file to-morrow, in spite of either orangemen or government. I'll see Lafferty at the digging, and I will take care to get the king's man snug from telling before the brig sails. Who guards the cave to-morrow?” The Frenchman answered, that he understood that Porter intended to go in disguise with the other leaders to the potato digging; and that a man, called Anthony Allen, was selected to guard the cave during their absence. This discovery concerned the peace of Ellen Hamilton too much to be neglected by M`Nelvin. To save Edward, therefore, from impending danger, became now the great object of his solicitude. At first he knew not how to act; but, as he had, for several years past, been accustomed in all his perplexities to seek advice from one whose counsel had never deceived him, namely, the Recluse, he now sought him, It was soon agreed that, as this was a case which justified a disregard of the punctilios of custom, or the fastidiousness of delicacy, they should, at once, make the affair known to her whom it most nearly concerned. Accordingly M`Nelvin hastened to the castle, from whence he brought Ellen, without loss of time, to the glen. The Recluse with as much caution and tenderness as possible, disclosed to her Edward's danger. For some minutes she remained the picture of surprise and horror, but said nothing; and so much did her emotions seem to have overcome her, that her friends began to repent having made the disclosure. At length tears came to her relief; and she found utterance. “I feared, I feared that it would come to this at last!” she exclaimed. “Unfortunate young man! O my friends, what can be done for him? He must not, surely he must not die!” “Can we with any prospect of success inform your grandfather of what is meditated against him?” inquired the Recluse. “I fear not,” she replied, “he is so much devoted to the will, and what he conceives to be the interest, of these conspirators, that to save his own life, he would scarcely risk a contention with them. —But he must be saved. Oh! Father of mercies, assist me! I shall deliver him out of that den of tygers, or I shall perish with him. It is no time now to act the woman. Pardon me, my friends, I am resolved. I shall penetrate into their inmost recesses. I shall find him. If they have even hearts of stone, I shall melt them, or if they be too obdurate, my hands shall give him weapons; we shall clear the way, or we shall die together.” Her frenzy startled, and confounded her auditors; but it suggested an idea to M`Nelvin, which he immediately communicated; and which by infusing hope into Ellen's mind, greatly calmed her agitation. “To-morrow,” said he, “I have learned, that the cave will be deserted by its usual inmates who are to attend the potato digging; and that Anthony Allen is appointed to remain sentinel over Mr. Middleton. He will not refuse Miss O'Halloran admittance. She may then inform the prisoner of his danger, and if we can contrive to draw Allen's attention for sometime, from the door of the cave, he may escape disguised in apparel similar to her's, which she can provide for the occasion.” “I shall try it,” said Ellen. “The case is desperate—I must bring my mind to make a desperate effort. Timidity, delicacy, shame, must give way to his safety.” After some deliberation, the Recluse approved of the project, as the only plausible means of rescuing his friend from the destruction that threatened him. How to manage Allen, so as to prevent him from recognising the prisoner, when he should pass from the cave, was now the difficulty. Neither the Recluse nor M`Nelvin were much trusted by the United Irishmen. They had both refused to take the oaths of fidelity to their party. But this was ascribed to a scrupulosity of conscience, with regard to swearing, and not to any disapprobation of the cause. On the contrary, they were considered well disposed to it; but as neither of them could give much efficient aid in a military view, the one being decrepid from age, and the other from accident, they were not much pressed on the subject. Still, as they did not belong to the body, they were not trusted by it. In this dilemma, they directed their views to Jemmy Hunter, who had served Edward so efficiently on a former occasion. Ellen now returned home to prepare the dress which was to be Edward's disguise. M`Nelvin left her at the castle gate, and went in search of Hunter. This young man, had been, for some weeks, a bridegroom, and as merry as a lark in a May morning; for his Peggy, who had long charmed him with her smiles and her blushes, had, at length, blessed him with her hand and her heart, and a happier couple could not have been found in the whole province. M`Nelvin found the young bridegroom working in a garden adjoining his dwelling house, with a heart in a humour to be pleased with every thing, and at that moment, full of the high delight he anticipated from marching with the large concourse of potato-diggers that were to assemble the next day. He was singing, “And a digging we will hie, And a digging we will hie, And we'll dig the fields of each brave man, Who in jail for truth doth lie.” M`Nelvin informed him that the Recluse had business with him, which could only be communicated in the cavern. “Come in awee, an' tak' a dram,” said Jemmy, “an' I'll gang wi' you directly. Peggy, my love, here's the poet come to see you. Gie us a drap o' the best Innishowen, for its the native, an' pys nae taxe to support the redcoats, an' the guagers.” Peggy, with all the graceful gentility of nature, produced the cheering pitcher, but as the poet was in haste, he begged Jemmy to go with him without delay, his business being important. He promised the fair bride, however, that some evening soon he would make amends for the shortness of his present visit. At Saunders's cave, Hunter was made acquainted with the whole affair, and was asked if he thought he could occupy Allen's attention in such a manner, that when the prisoner would pass out, he might be prevented from so closely observing him as to endanger detection. He readily undertook to do so. “And, by heavens, if he does detect him,” said he, “I'll pinion him wi' sitch a grip that he'll no' e'en stir, till Mr. Middleton be clear oot o' his reach. It will be doing mare guid, I think, to my neighbour than going to dig Rabbin M`Brim's potatoes. Damn the butchers, but we maun save the lad. He was a guid frien' to Peggy, and she aye thinks weel o' him, an' I'll no' forget him in his pinch.” The morning rose that ushered in the potato digging-day, in which numerous throngs of lads and lasses dressed in their best attire, with light and merry hearts came from all parts of the adjacent country, into the town of Larne; the lads to march to the work of charity and benevolence, the lasses to witness the procession, and reward their lovers as they passed them with their smiles. During this year, frequent assemblages of the people took place in different parts of the country to work the land, or gather in the harvest, of those who for their obnoxious politics had become inmates of the jails, or were otherwise prevented from attending to their domestic concerns. On the occasion to which we now particularly refer, upwards of five thousand men marched, in rank and file, carrying no other weapons than spades and baskets to the scene of their industry, and in the course of a few hours performed an immense quantity of labour, in raising and housing the potatoes of their proscribed confederate. These assemblages for rural industry, were contrived by the leaders of the conspiracy, in order to display the popularity of their cause, and thereby encourage their friends to perseverance, and prevent the lukewarm and timid from defection. Great care was taken that their proceedings should Q be conducted in a peaceable and orderly manner, so that no pretence should be given for magisterial interference; and, it is astonishing how well they succeeded, considering the unruly and heterogeneous multitude they had to manage. But zeal for the cause, and a general conviction that its character and success depended on the propriety with which these public bodies conducted themselves, had the effect of preventing every kind of tumult, and these assemblages generally dispersed with as much sobriety and decorum as a congregation withdraws from church. “It was in the afternoon of that day, when all the conspirators except the sentinel had left the cave, that, with an agitated and fearful heart, as if she were approaching some crisis of her fate, Ellen, in company with Hunter, hastened to the prison of her lover, with a resolution to effect his deliverance, or die with him. Often, however, the feelings of the woman would obtrude upon her, and for a moment damp the determination of the lover. But the recollection of Edward's danger still prevailed, and enabled her to persist. Without hesitation she and her attendant were admitted by Allen. The granddaughter of O'Halloran could not be suspected, and Hunter had been long the particular friend of Allen. Besides, ever since his life had been in jeopardy at Antrim, the particulars of which story were widely circulated, he had became highly popular with his party. He remained on the outside, to converse with Allen, whilst Ellen advanced. She had now, however, to experience the greatest struggle with her delicacy that she had yet encountered, as she recollected that she was thus voluntarily seeking the presence of a young man in absolute solitude, who had professed himself her lover. Thrice after admittance, she hesitated on her step as if to argue the propriety of proceeding or returning. But her resolution carried her forward, and she appeared in Edward's presence lovely and blushing, but disconcerted and speechless with the conflict of terror, shame and solicitude which agitated her bosom. He was, at the first view, so struck with astonishment that he could scarcely believe the vision to be real. “What happiness!” he exclaimed, “Has an angel in the dearest of all created forms, come to visit me in my prison?” She sunk upon a chair, and almost fainted. He ran to support her, but she soon recovered her self-possession sufficiently to account for her appearance, by relating the danger she had discovered him to be in, and the means she had provided for his escape. It is needless to repeat the expressions of gratitude and rapture in which Edward now indulged. She, however, soon reminded him that there was no time for conversation, and that if he meant to escape, he must haste and depart.— She now supplied him with an exact duplicate of the clothes she then wore, and in a few minutes, he was disguised. “Let me,” said he, “before I part from my guardian angel, kneel with her one precious minute before the throne of Heaven, that I may implore blessings upon her head.” They both kneeled; and he fervently caught her hand in his while he uttered the following prayer. “Almighty Protector of innocence, and searcher of hearts, on my knees, I implore thee to be a shield to one of the fairest and purest of thy creatures. Thou knowest the alarming dangers, in the midst of which I am about to leave her; but thou art sufficient to deliver her from them. Without that assurance, O God, how could I support that separation which is now become inevitable. O grant, that we may again meet under more benign circumstances, and that we may then never part until thy last summons shall call us to immortality. Preserve her for me in my absence, faithful, lovely and innocent as she now is; and hear me, while I vow eternal fidelity to her—May this heart which now beats for her alone, beat no more, ere it shall know another earthly love; and may this hand become enfeebled and withered, ere it shall grasp in the holy ordinance of wedlock, any hand but the dear one which it now holds!” He then imprinted on her hand a fervent kiss, and bidding her adieu, rushed toward the door. Allen mistaking him for Miss O'Halloran was for running to assist him in getting out; but Hunter, who by this time had enticed him to the bottom of the rock, desired him to remain where he was, as he knew the young lady disliked to be disturbed with such attentions. He added, that though he had conveyed her here, he knew that she wished to return home by herself, and as his friend Allen was alone here to day, he believed he should stay a few hours to keep him company. “Why, Allen, man,” said he, “you should think o' gettin' married. I'm tauld that Jenny Davis is amaist wud aboot you; an' she's a nice lass; an' her father can gie her twa hunner pun' ony day. Lord, man, I was never sae happy, as I hae been these four weeks past, wi' Peggy. Ye ken I wad tak' naething wi' her, though her father says we'll fare naething the war o' that, or a' be owre.” Allen confessed that he had a hankering after Jenny; but feared that she liked Tam Mathewson better than him. By this time, Edward had ascended the hill that overlooked his late prison; and in a few minutes more, he found himself safe in the Recluse's habitation. His disguise was soon thrown aside. “All has succeeded; Heaven be praised!” exclaimed the old man. “M`Nelvin waits at the top of the glen with your horse. Haste, fly, leave this distracted place, for there is no safety here; and God be with you!” “I go, Farewell, Father! We shall yet meet again. Till then, under heaven, I charge you with the care of the angel who has delivered me.” “Adieu, my son. No earthly consideration shall prevent me from attending to that charge. Yonder is your horse.” Edward sprang forward, and seized M`Nelvin by the hand. “Farewell!” said he. “Be still Miss O'Halloran's friend; I shall ever be yours.” He spurred his steed, and in three hours more found himself at the hospitable gate of Shane's Castle.</field>

XV. * * * * * * Say to them thus— Good sirs, be not alarmed at my escape; Though I dislike your projects, plots and treasons, And would resign my life to disappoint them, I'll not expose you, for it might be thought I bore mean malice. Simon Gurty. The princely mansion of the ancient family of O'Neil, at which Edward Barrymore had now arrived, was then the pride of the surrounding country, it being the most entire and perfect specimen of the magnificence of ancient architecture to be found in Ulster. It is now no more. The fury of an accidental conflagration which took place in 1816, was sufficient, in a few hours, to convert into ashes that proud and stately structure, which had cost our ancestors the expenditure of many years of great skill, care and industry to erect. Thus adding another to those innumerable examples with which both history and experience have made us acquainted of the vanity of human calculations, and the frailty of human works. The pleasure felt by the noble owner of this venerable edifice, as he gave the cordial welcome of a friendly Irish heart to our hero who had been so long and so mysteriously lost, is easy to be imagined. He informed him of the anxiety of his friends respecting him, and of the unpleasant adventure that had befallen his servant. The former he had anticipated, and it had given him considerable uneasiness during his captivity. Of the latter he had never heard; for while in confinement, very little of what passed in the world, came to his ears. After such a tedious imprisonment, he now felt how sweet it was to breathe unlimited air, how delicious to be master of his own motions. A regard for the safety of O'Halloran, prevented him from acquainting lord O`Neil with what he had suffered, and he merely stated in general terms, that a variety of accidents had, during the whole summer, conspired to detain him on the coast. “That part of the country abounds with the disaffected, I understand,” said his lordship. “It also abounds with steady, peaceable and loyal subjects,” replied Edward. “It is a very interesting portion of the country.” “What number of the military are, at present, in Larne?” enquired the earl. “I believe that it is thought unnecessary to keep more than a single company of Fifeshire fencibles there,” said Edward. “If that be sufficient to preserve the peace there, it is more than can be said of this neighbourhood,” observed his lordship. “Here the presence of almost a whole regiment is requisite. The times are getting very awful. I begin to think that it would have been as well to have spared Orr. The people have been very much inflamed by that affair. But this is not the worst. French principles, I understand, have lately been every where disseminated with fearful success, and I am sorry to be credibly informed, that the mischievous writings of Paine are now more read by the lower orders than the Bible itself. I do indeed forebode very unhappy consequences to result from this state of things. It behoves all who have the preservation of social order, and rational government at heart, to be vigilant and active in restraining the excesses to which the misguided populace threaten to run.” A summons from the ladies to attend the tea-table put an end to this conversation. Edward passed a very agreeable evening in this refined society, which greatly conduced to calm the perturbation of his mind. Being in haste to return home, that he might relieve the solicitude of his friends, he, the next morning, continued his journey to the residence of Sir Philip Martin, attended by one of lord O'Neil's servants. He arrived there on the following day, and was received with all that cordiality and friendship he expected from a worthy family, with the heir of which he had been long and intimately acquainted. Here he met with honest Tom Mullins, who was nearly broken-hearted with vexation on his master's account—for although he had no knowledge of what had really happened, he could not get rid of a vague suspicion, that the United Irishmen had done him harm. He had been detained at Sir Philip Martin's during the whole summer, at the suggestion of the Recluse, who feared that if he returned to Dublin, he might give such information to Edward's friends as would direct their attention to O'Halloran's neighbourhood, and, perhaps, bring that gentleman into trouble. Sir Philip conversed much concerning the Recluse. He confessed that he was on the most confidential footing with him; “and you, Mr. Barrymore,” said he, “have the honour to be one of his chief favourites. I have had frequent letters from him of late, in each of which you are mentioned in the most approving terms; and, let me tell you, I conceive it no slight honour to have met with such decided approbation from such a man. I am acquainted with every incident of importance that befel you, from your deliverance by O'Halloran, till your imprisonment for being an obstinate loyalist, a character which, I perceive, my old true-hearted friend, does not much relish. However, you and I shall not dispute on that subject. I shall not, as my friend did, make an attempt to convert you; although I cannot but wish that during the approaching struggle, of which I suppose you have been forwarned, the cause of the people should possess the support of more such men of talents and influence as you are, than I am sorry to find it does; and, believe me, your misunderstanding with the United Irishmen arose chiefly from their solicitude to make such an acquisition as you would be to their party. For this purpose they sounded you, and in so doing gave you more knowledge of their affairs than they afterwards thought it consistent with their safety you should possess. Hence they secured you. How you got out of their strong hold, unless with their permission, I cannot tell. I am glad, however, that you are out, for I looked upon your confinement as altogether a useless precaution against a man of your humanity and honour. You see, I know your character. Not only the Recluse, but my son has been at pains to represent it in such a favourable light, that I hesitate not to open my mind to you at once without reserve.” Edward expressed his grateful sense of the testimony his friends had given of him, and hoped that Sir Philip would never have cause to think him unworthy of it, or to repent the candour with which he had disclosed his political sentiments. As to the mode of his escape from captivity, he did not then feel free to disclose it; but, he hoped, the time would come, when it would be his pride to relate it to his friends.—Sir Philip expressed his acquiescence; and the subject of politics was dropped. Charles Martin, Edward's fellow-student, and bosom-friend, had been absent with his sisters, two pretty and amiable girls, on a visit to a house of a neighbouring gentleman. They, however, returned early in the evening, and great was the joy of Edward and his friend on meeting. Sir Philip had not acquainted his son with Edward's imprisonment; for their political principles being somewhat different, he was unwilling to prejudice the cause of the United Irishmen, by informing him of any thing that would lessen them in his esteem. Hence, when during a solitary walk, which the young friends took through Sir Philip's shrubberies, in order to relate to each other their adventures since they last parted, Charles was astonished and grieved at the extraordinary and perilous nature of those which had befallen Edward. “I fear,” said he, “that the machinations of these men against you are not over. What a pity that their connexions are so extended that we cannot bring them to justice, without involving those we love in their punishment. I agree with you, that all the circumstances considered, it is better to be silent on the subject. If you insist on immediately departing for Dublin, as your friends are so anxious concerning you, I cannot object, although I hoped to enjoy your company for several weeks here. But we shall not part so soon. I will accompany you if you will wait but a couple of days, that I may make arrangements for the journey.” This being agreed to, and Edward having one day's rest on his hands, wrote to the Recluse an account of his safety and welfare, and requesting speedy intelligence concerning Ellen and the conduct of the United Irishmen on discovering his escape. At length, the two friends, well armed and well attended, set out for the capital, where they arrived on the third day without encountering any accident. Edward was now once more amongst his relations, and the friends of his youth, an inhabitant of the metropolis of his country. But his heart and his affections were in a remote province. It was in vain that the ladies of Dublin assumed their most interesting and fascinating looks in his presence; in vain were the various pleasures of that captivating city spread before him, and offered to his acceptance. His Ellen was afar off, and, perhaps in danger, and how could he be happy? It came into his mind, that some of the most unprincipled of the conspirators might be so revengeful and unmanly, as to resent upon her, the part she had taken in his rescue. This idea rendered him miserable. He wrote a second time to the Recluse, conjuring him to lose no time in acquainting him with the treatment that Ellen had received from her grandfather and his confederates, after his departure. It was, however, only the next day after forwarding this letter that his mind was set at ease on this subject, by receiving one from the old man in reply to that which he had written at Sir Philip Martin's. He was informed, that the United men kept the circumstance of his escape very quiet, that the whole blame was thrown on Jemmy Hunter, who was very willing to bear it. The old man added, that he even believed that O'Halloran was secretly rejoiced at it. “He, indeed,” said he, “pretty sternly and closely interrogated Ellen, as to her motives for assisting in the affair, and when she candidly told him of the plot that was laid for his destruction, he affected not to credit it. But, he said, that it was on the whole, perhaps, as well that you were out of their power, and that he had never approved of the scheme of sending you to France. He also mentioned, that if he could persuade his coadjutors that they had no reason to dread your informing on them, he should entirely approve of what she had done. She took this opportunity to acquaint him with the whole of the Frenchman's villany towards herself. (Here the Recluse related the incidents of Monier's attack upon her, of which Edward was ignorant, but of which the reader has been already informed.) This, at length, aroused his indignation against the foreigner; and he that evening communicated the whole to Porter, Nelson, and another of the leaders named M`Cracken. They all joined in reprobating such conduct, and agreed to induce him to leave the country, by persuading him that the government had become apprised of his residence and employment, and that his safety depended on his returning to France, in the vessel which was about to sail with their despatches for his government.—And the country has, in consequence, got rid of a mischievous visiter * * *.” Edward resolved immediately to allay the fears of the United party, respecting the knowledge he had obtained of their measures. He, therefore, wrote a long letter to O'Halloran, in which he disclaimed any feelings of resentment on account of his confinement, which he altogether ascribed to the motives that had been assigned, the imperious nature of which on their minds he could duly appreciate. He concluded this letter by informing O'Halloran, that as his motives for concealing his real name and character no longer existed, he would now confess that he was the apparent representative of a family, sufficiently high in office and in influence, to procure for any of his party, who wished to return to their duty, forgiveness of the past, provided they would give security for the future. He would, therefore, assume his real name, which a desire to enjoy the esteem of some who had suddenly become extremely dear to him, but whose suspicion and dislike, he believed, a knowledge of that name would have excited, had induced him for a time to conceal. “I the more readily,” said he, “give you my name on this occasion, as I flatter myself that it will confirm your reliance on my promise of secrecy respecting your affairs, by showing you that on the fulfilment of that promise, I stake the honour of a house that has never yet acted dishonourably, the house of Barrymore.” Having thus replaced Edward Barrymore, after his perilous journey to the North, in safety among his friends, we may leave him there unnoticed, for some months, as nothing remarkable happened to him during that period, and turn our attention to what, in the meantime, befel the beauteous and tender mistress of his affections. The sentinel at the cave deceived by the disguise of Edward, and amazed by the artifices of Jemmy Hunter, did not, for several hours, discover that his prisoner had escaped. The first intimation he had of it, was by Hunter roundly saying, “I think Miss O'Halloran will noo be tired waitin'; I maun see her hame.” “Why, she's gane lang since,” said the sentinel. “Maybe sae, an' maybe no'. I'll see wha's within, however,” replied Hunter. Accordingly in he and the sentinel went; when to the astonishment and confusion of the latter, Miss O'Halloran appeared in her own identical person. “An' wha went oot in your likeness?” inquired the wondering sentinel at the trembling girl. “She made no reply, but held down her head to conceal her shame; for she had really become innocently ashamed, while the big tears stood ready to burst from her eyes. “Never mind,” said Hunter, intercedingly, “the fault was a' mine. Ye ken, Allen, I wad na let you rin after the gentleman, when he gat oot, or ye might hae broucht him back to his prison.” “The gentleman!” exclaimed Allen. “I hope R the gentleman's no' fled. Our officers will think I hae betrayed them. Some o' them may be for takin' my life. Ye ken some that wad na stap at that, if they thought I did it willingly. I should hae done my duty better.” “Fear naething,” said his companion. “Jemmy Hunter will stan' by you, through thick an' thin, an' tak' a' the blame, as he deserves to do, on him. In the meantime, his honour's daughter here, ye ken, canna be in the fault. I maun just see her hame; an' I'll be back in a crack to stan' between you an' danger.” “Mr. Allen,” said Ellen, who had considerably recovered from her confusion, “I shall stay here, and confess the share I have had in your prisoner's escape, rather than that you should be subjected to any trouble on its account.” “No, my lady,” said the gallant Allen, “you can tell the truth as weel in the castle as here. Since he is gane, it canna be helpit noo. It's useless to fret; an' Jemmy here is willing to bear the blame o't; an' I dinna mislippen Jemmy makin' his word guid at a' risks. So, I dinna like, my lady, to see you sae vexed aboot it. When you gang hame, your aunt Brown will gie you mair comfort than I can. Jemmy, you can gae wi' her; but see that you be back in time to clear me frae the blame?” Jemmy promised he would; and in company with his fair charge, he set off for the castle. “Do you think he is safe?” muttered Ellen, almost unconsciously, as they went along. “He is, I'll swear it to you,” was her companion's reply. “Thank heaven! she ejaculated. “But alas! what have I done? what will they say of me?” “Never mind that,” replied her comforter, “you hae saved a gentleman's life, an' God will bless you for it as lang as you live; and I hope, that he winna forget me either, for helpin' in it.” “You have a good heart, James,” said she, “and I trust, that you will indeed be blessed for what you have done this day.” “Thank you, thank you, lady,” said he, his heart swelling within him at the praise she had so fervently bestowed upon him. “You'll mak' me prood o' this day as lang as I live.” Having conducted her to the castle, he left her, and returned with a light and satisfied heart to the cave. When O'Halloran, Porter, Nelson, M`Cracken and their confederates returned in the evening from the potato-digging, they were, at first, much surprised and chagrined at what had taken place. “If the fellow dont inform on us,” said Nelson, after his first excitement had somewhat abated, “the matter will not indeed much grieve me; for I believe we could never have prevailed on him to join us.” “Though we should, perhaps, have less cause for alarm,” said O'Halloran, if he were still in our power, “yet I am almost persuaded that he has too much honour to be an informer.” “I agree with you,” said Porter, “and when I reflect on the whole tenor of his conduct, while in confinement, I own that I see no great cause for apprehension.” “I am glad gentlemen,” said M`Cracken, “that you console yourselves so easily; and, since the misfortune cannot now be remedied, I must acknowledge that philosophy to be the soundest, which enables us with the least difficulty to bear it.” Thus these active chiefs made a virtue of necessity; and in place of repining at any accident which would have tended to dishearten their followers, they put a good countenance upon every disaster; and, casting irremediable events as much as possible from their thoughts, proceeded to make the best of the advantages they still possessed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XVI. When we think of that Island, old Nature's delight, Where first she displayed all her charms to our sight, Where oft we enjoyed every pleasure in store, Of friendship and love, and whiskey galore; Oh, sure! oh sure! that patriot glow, Our fathers felt so long ago, Must o'er our ardent bosoms sway, And bid us rejoice in Patrick's Day. Irish Soothsayer. Although Ellen was treated with indulgence on the occasion just related, it was not long till she suffered persecution enough of another kind. A certain Sir Geoffrey Carebrow, a very formal bachelor, of great property, who had lately come, after several year's absence, to reside on an estate which he possessed in the neighbourhood, having met with her at a public ball which was given in Larne, during the Christmas holidays, became violently enamoured of her. He was a man, who, from his youth, was noted for a union of two passions seldom found united in the same person, a love of women and a love of money. Although he possessed estates which yielded him upwards of fifteen thousand a year, with nearly a hundred and fifty thousand pounds in the national funds, he had hitherto been deterred from wedlock on account of the expense of supporting a wife and rearing a family. He fancied he could gratify his amorous propensities at a much cheaper rate by constantly keeping an obliging housekeeper, and two or three good-natured servant girls. For the offspring thus produced, he could with far less expense R 2 provide, than for legitimate children, as neither their expectations nor their claims would be so high; and, as to a wife, he sagaciously concluded, that there was no comparison between the freedoms she would naturally take with both his credit and his purse, and the trifling gratuities he might voluntarily bestow on a menial girl. Thus he had hitherto lived in the indulgence of both lewdness and avarice, until his thousands and his bastards had become equally numerous. At the ball we have mentioned, the exquisite beauty and bewitching sweetness of Ellen's countenance, together with the graceful symmetry of her form, and the inimitable easiness of her motions, as she threaded the mazy dance, struck on his luxurious fancy with a force altogether irresistible, and he immediately centred all his wishes and happiness in the enjoyment of such charms. To effect this, he discovered to be no easy matter. A little reflection convinced him that illicit gratification was out of the question. Her principles were unassailable by either flattery or bribery; and as to stratagem or force, if he should by such means succeed in overcoming her virtue, the whole of that numerous party whom he knew to be devoted to her grandfather, (for he had lately become acquainted with some of the secrets of the United Irishmen,) would mark him for vengeance, and his life would inevitably pay the penalty of such an offence. There remained, therefore, no other means of possessing her than by breaking through his long formed resolution against matrimony, and making her the partner of his fortune. This was a horrible alternative; but he felt that he could not be happy without her, and he resolved to adopt it. He accordingly took the earliest opportunity of making known to her his wishes. She at once gave him an unequivocal and decided denial. In vain did he make her the most splendid offers; in vain did he enlarge on his immense wealth, and on the violence and sincerity of his passion, which he asserted would never permit him to know happiness without her. She was inexorable. He next had recourse to her grandfather; and soon gained his favour, by suddenly becoming a warm friend to the United cause. As he had been hitherto considered, not indeed a royalist, but a very lukewarm favourer of the popular party, O'Halloran looked on his accession as a matter of great importance. At this juncture it was in reality so. By order of the Dublin Directory, a certain quantity of arms and ammunition was to be provided by the Northern conspirators, before the middle of March ensuing. To raise money for this purpose was no easy matter. The greater number of the zealous leaders were men of broken fortunes; and the voluntary contributions of the lower orders, came in so slowly, and in such small sums, as to be of little or no service. Great was the anxiety that our Northern chiefs felt on this occasion; and frequent were the consultations they held on the subject. O'Halloran had already expended within the last fifteen months, about thirty thousand pounds on account of the confederacy; a great portion of which had gone to relieve the distresses of those whom the government had harrassed on account of their obnoxious principles. Upwards of sixty thousand pounds were wanted on the present occasion. To raise this sum was beyond his power, without mortgaging his estate, and perhaps paying an exorbitant interest. This, however, he resolved to do, rather than permit the cause to suffer. To Sir Geoffrey Carebrow, he, therefore, applied, as at this crisis he was almost the only monied man connected with the party. A mortgage for sixty thousand pounds was immediately executed, of which forty thousand were paid down, at an interest, secretly agreed upon, of ten per cent.; the remaining sum being promised in six weeks. The parties to this bargain also entered into a secret stipulation that both the principal and the interest of this mortgage should be at the control of Ellen Hamilton, when she should become the wife of Sir Geoffrey Carebrow. With the money thus procured, a vessel was despatched to Scotland, from whence she returned in a few weeks, with the requisite supply of warlike stores for the conspirators. In the meantime, Sir Geoffrey did not fail to use the advantage which he had thus obtained over O'Halloran, in prosecuting his suit for Ellen. His vehement professions of patriotism blinded O'Halloran to his other faults; and he looked with respect upon a character whom had he known better he would have detested. But being himself the very reverse of a hypocrite, he was the less likely to suspect hypocrisy in others. Hence he firmly believed Carebrow's patriotism to be sincere. For the same reason he was convinced, that his attachment to Ellen was not only genuine, but ardent and disinterested; and being unquestionably a man of great wealth, he conceived that he consulted both her interest and happiness by ordering her to receive his addresses and to look on him as her future husband. This was a source of great affliction to this dutiful and affectionate girl. She now felt herself for the first time obliged to disobey him who was her only parent, and whose directions she had hitherto considered as an unerring rule of conduct. Things were in this state, when that great national day which warms and elevates every Irish heart, the day consecrated to Erin's tutelary saint, arrived, and was celebrated at O'Halloran Castle by a splendid entertainment, somewhat in the character of the political dinners which the Inns and the Outs have so frequently given in the metropolis of the British empire. On this occasion all the Northern leaders of the conspiracy who could conveniently attend were present. The room was fancifully decorated with national emblems and various transparencies, denoting but not plainly expressing the sentiments and views of the company. The figure of a harp without the crown, over which was displayed in large letters, the word Independence, and under-neath Erin-go-bragh, ornamented the centre of the walls, on the opposite sides of the room. On each of the two other walls was seen a figure of St. Patrick, in his ecclesiastical robes, baptizing the monarch of Ireland, who held in his hand a branch of Shamrock, over which was the inscription “Three in One;” while over their heads were exhibited the following words, “Be free in Christ;” and at the bottom of the piece, “Love one another.” In the centre of the room, equally distant from two splendid chandeliers, which shed their brilliant illumination all around, was suspended a large transparent square, on each side of which the following distich appeared in gilt letters: Unite, and the freedom of Erin restore, And tyrants, like serpents, shall die on her shore. The reader, if he has any thing of a tolerable imagination, will easily conceive the nature of the toasts that were given in this assembly; but as he will readily suppose that the greater number of them were not exactly what many would consider of the most orthodox description, I beg permission to omit them here, with the exception of the first; “The memory of St. Patrick,” which was legiti mate enough had it not been the first, and the last; “The downfall of Tyrants,” which was undoubtedly a very good toast, if the company could only have agreed with their neighbours in the application of the last word. After supper the natural buoyancy of Irish spirits found vent in a ball, which was graced by as many beautiful female countenances as the same number of the sex ever exhibited. It was opened by the accomplished and enthusiastic Rober Emmet, then on a tour through the North, and Ellen, who decorated by her grandfather's desire, in the most tasteful manner for the occasion, tript the mazy round with a liveliness and grace which delighted every one who beheld her. Sir Geoffrey who was too unwieldy for dancing, had his fondness for her so excited, that he kept dangling about her and watching her motions in the most disagreeable and troublesome manner. Even the youth who was her partner, and whose heart was at that time engaged to another, could not escape his jealousy. He perceived it, and declined dancing as soon as decency permitted. When Ellen was seated, Sir Geoffrey placed himself by her side, and exceedingly annoyed her with his importunities; but she bore them with a patience which displayed her good nature to so much advantage, that it excited almost as much admiration as her personal charms. When the dance terminated, a new species of patriotic entertainment was exhibited. It had been invented by the Rev. Mr. Porter, expressly for the occasion, and approved of by the other leaders, as an excitement to the patriotic ingenuity of the company. A splendid seat, approachable by steps, resembling a throne, was prepared for one of the ladies, who should be chosen to personate the genius of Ireland, in whose presence each gentleman who joined in the amusement, should stand and deliver some national sentiment. The person who, in her opinion, should deliver the most striking, tasteful and patriotic sentiment, she was to crown with a wreath of artificial Shamrock, and pronounce him the victor in this species of intellectual contest. Ellen was unanimously chosen to represent her Country's Genius. She ascended the throne, with a wreath in one hand, and a small parchment tablet in the other. When seated, she assumed a peculiar dignity of manner, such as the imagination of Shakspeare might have conceived the genius of nature's sweetest island to possess; and addressed the company in the following words: “I invite every Irishman who hears me, to come forward, and in the presence of his country's genius express, in one sentence, the patriotic feelings of his soul; and on the brows of him who shall excel all his competitors, in the force, fervour and elegance of his sentiment, so expressed, I shall bind this wreath, the emblem of his country's faith, and the reward of his merit.—But first, I require that every candidate for this reward shall inscribe his name on this tablet.” The following names were immediately inscribed; Samuel Nelson, Robert Emmet, Henry M`Cracken, Henry O`Halloran, Luke Teeling, James Porter, Geoffrey Carebrow and Thomas Russel. After counting the names, “eight patriots,” said she, “are enrolled as candidates for this prize. If there be any other present who wishes to contend for it, let him come forward, now or never.” One of the musicians, who appeared to be unknown to the company, habited in the costume of ancient minstrelsy, with a long flowing green robe bound round his waist with a sash of the same colour, and having a hood of green velvet so constructed as to conceal his countenance from observation, now modestly advanced, and making a graceful bow to the fair genius, inscribed his name, Patrick Fitzgerald. The Genius then called over the names, and invited Samuel Nelson, the first on the list, to deliver his sentiment. “Fair Genius,” said he, “it is my opinion that the man who will not cheerfully sacrifice both life and property, to rescue his country from a foreign yoke, is unworthy to be called her son.” Emmet then advanced. “Genius of Erin,” said he, “I consider the man who has an opportunity, to sacrifice both life and property for the independence and freedom of his country, to be born to a happy destiny, for he is born to immortal fame.” M`Cracken then came forward. “Genius,” said he, “may the oppressors of thy beloved Island be like the serpents they so much resemble, unable to exist on her soil.” O'Halloran next advanced. “Genius,” said he, “may the coward heart that will not resist tyranny even unto death, never know the joys of freedom, nor ever be found in an Irishman's bosom.” Teeling next addressed her. “Genius of this venerated country!” said he, “in striking for her liberty, may the soul of him who dies be rewarded by the applause of angels, and of him who survives by the long enjoyment of a nation's blessing.” Porter advanced and exclaimed—“Genius of a once blessed and sanctified, but now unhappy and polluted country! when the crisis of her fate arrives, may Heaven supply her sons with strength to avenge her wrongs, and restore her ancient happiness and glory, and with wisdom to frame and adopt such regulations as will preserve them to all posterity.” Sir Geoffrey next approached. “Charming Genius of a charming country!” said he, “may he who will not fight in her cause, never enjoy the fruits of her soil, nor the smiles of her daughters.” Russel now came forward and said, “Genius of my native country! may we soon see the day when our enemies shall be compelled to confess her sons to be invincible, her cause to be just, and their own disgrace and punishment to be merited.” The minstrel Fitzgerald was now called. He advanced modestly, but with dignity, and all-peculiarly as he was attired, the elegance of his figure struck the beholders, and many of the fair ladies wished in vain for a view of that countenance which he kept so carefully concealed. “Lovely Genius of a beloved country!” said he, “O! may that God who alone can rescue her from misery, grant her a speedy and permanent deliverance, and render her children happy and worthy of happiness.” “Nothing more can be wished, nor better wished, for our dear but suffering country,” said the Genius. “To thee, then, pious minstrel, I award the wreath thou hast justly won, by the noble simplicity, the affecting piety, and the fervid patriotism of thy sentiment. Sentiments have been given to-night of high merit in these respects, but thine hath surpassed them all.” She then crowned him with the wreath as he voluntarily kneeled before her. “Genius,” said he, still retaining his humble posture. “This to me is a happy night; it shall long be a proud one. I have fervently prayed to my Creator in behalf of my country, in the presence of thee, my beloved, and by thy hands is my S fervency thus rewarded. This sacred prize I shall ever preserve for thy sake.” He hastily arose, leaving Ellen in extreme agitation, bowed to the wondering company, and disappeared before any of them could sufficiently recover from their astonishment, to ask him for a gratification of that curiosity concerning him which had become visible in every countenance. “Who is he? Does any one know him?” exclaimed several of the gentlemen. “He is a noble, an elegant young man,” thought all the ladies. “He is an audacious intruder,” cried Sir Geoffrey; “an impertinent puppy! What arrogance and impudence, to make love in this public manner to Miss O'Halloran! But I'll chastise the rascal.” With difficulty he was prevented from immediately rushing after the object of his rage in order to attempt putting his threats into execution. Although none of the gentlemen openly objected to Ellen's disposal of the wreath, several of them considered her as having displayed an erroneous judgment, in giving the preference to a sentiment, the patriotism of which was, in their opinion, at least ambiguous. Nay, some of them, among whom was O'Halloran himself, thought that they could perceive in it, an implied censure on their confederacy. It called upon heaven to deliver the country from its calamities; but it did not discriminate the party from which these calamities had sprung. Nay it even insinuated that the people were in the fault; for while it prayed for their happiness, it took care to express a wish for their amendment, that they might deserve it. “Had it mentioned our oppressors,” said O'Halloran, “and prayed either for their conversion or destruction, we should then have known the side to which this successful youth belongs. By not doing so, he has plainly declared himself, if not altogether our enemy, at least not very heartily our friend.” But no one complained in Ellen's hearing of her decision. By previous arrangement her judgment was to be absolute and final on the subject; and although among themselves, the gentlemen might animadvert on its correctness, they were aware that it would be both illiberal and unjust openly to blame her for exercising a prerogative with which they themselves had invested her, and which not one of them doubted that she had exercised conscientiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XVII. A wolf rapacious, rough and bold, Whose nightly plunders thinned the fold Contemplating his ill-spent life, And cloy'd with thefts, would take a wife. The loathing lamb with horror hears, And wearies out her dam with prayers; But all in vain, the dam best knew What inexperienced girls should do. Mrs. Moore's Fables. The jealousy which Sir Geoffrey had conceived against the minstrel, who had so boldly, in his hearing, and in his presence, made love, as he imagined, to his intended wife, and who had received such an unequivocal and public proof of her favour, boiled furiously within his breast, and although he had, with great effort, suppressed it, so far as not to throw the company into absolute confusion, yet he determined to spare no pains in finding the minstrel, and making him feel his vengeance. When the company had dispersed, he demanded an interview with Ellen; for he could brook no delay in ascertaining whether she knew the youth she had so openly and so flatteringly signalized, and whether her doing so had not arisen from a softer feeling than a preference of his sentiment. To obtain this interview for him, O'Halloran had to interfere with his authority, and she stipulated that it should be in his presence. She positively denied any knowledge of the minstrel, or that she had been influenced in his favour by any concealed sentiment whatever. Sir Geoffrey now urged the violence of his passion, which he confessed occasioned him to be jealous of every thing she seemed to approve, while he himself was an object of her dislike. “Lovely girl,” said he, “in the presence of your grandfather, only allay my apprehension of losing you, by promising to become my wife, and I shall be happy.” She replied not. Her grandfather urged her to speak. “My dear Ellen,” said he, “consult your own welfare and mine, by accepting a man who loves you so sincerely, and who has abundantly the power of promoting your felicity. You know not how soon the arm of oppression, or the accidents of war, may deprive you of my protection; and, oh! think how it would relieve the pangs of my last hour to reflect, that you had a sure and just claim to that of a friend I so much value as Sir Geoffrey.” “Best and tenderest of parents,” she replied, “since I must once more speak on this unhappy subject—O! do not attribute my refusal of a man I cannot love, to any undutiful feeling towards you. If my prayers can have any effect with Heaven, you shall long live to be my protector; but if a dispensation should take place, on which I tremble to reflect, if you should be prematurely and violently taken from me, I shall not long need a protector, for I feel, that in such a case, thy grave would soon be mine. Do not, do not, I conjure you, by the memory of the saint who gave me birth, do not compel me to do an act which would terminate all my happiness in this world.” “Ellen,” said O'Halloran, “you are obstinate; but you do not know Sir Geoffrey sufficiently, or you would not scruple to become his wife. Reflect S 2 on his power, his wealth, his patriotism, his friendship for me, his love for you; and you cannot but be convinced that in accepting him for your husband, you accept a man worthy of you, and provide a permanent asylum against misfortune and sorrow. But if any absurd or romantic feeling renders you perverse on this matter, depend on it I shall consult your interest better than to indulge that feeling. It is my duty to do so. Eight days you shall have to reflect on the subject, at the end of which time, I shall expect your compliance with our wishes. If still obstinate, I shall find means to make you comply. But I trust that your own good sense will be sufficient, and render it unnecessary for me to have recourse to such means.” The harshness and cool determined tone with which this was uttered overpowered her, for she saw that her grandfather's resolution to sacrifice her to the man she detested, was unalterably fixed; and that the sacrifice must be soon made. She burst into tears; but remained silent. “I shall urge you no more at present,” said O'Halloran, rising to depart, “but remember my will, and your own interest.” “Cruel girl,” said Sir Geoffrey, before he left the room, “why require such exercise of authority to compel you to be my wife, the wife of one who bears for you such unbounded love. But at the expiration of the time fixed by your grandfather, I hope your sentiments will be more favourable.” He then seized her hand to kiss it on departing, which she resisted. “Leave me, sir,” said she, “nor make me more wretched, and yourself more hated.” “Then adieu, my fair one. In another week this cruelty will be useless,” he replied. When they had retired, she threw herself on her knees, and thus besought the Almighty Protector of innocence. “Father of the fatherless, I implore thee, for pity in my present distress. O! deliver me from this calamity. Open the eyes of my revered and beloved grandfather, to see the gulf of wretchedness into which his mistaken affection would plunge me.— But if thou hast destined me to this lot, if I do wrong in opposing his desires, show me my error, and grant me fortitude and resignation to submit. In resisting the will of my earthly parent, I would not resist thine, my Heavenly father! Forgive me, therefore, if, in the weakness of my nature, I should resist. Thou hast fixed my affections on an object, whom surely it cannot be a crime to love, since it is no crime to love excellence. To him I have secretly dedicated my heart. O save me from the guilt of giving my hand to another. Alas! I am, perhaps, guilty of loving an earthly being too much, for my heart has cherished his image so fondly, that it has almost encroached on that adoration which is alone due to thee. But for mercy-sake do thou overlook my frailty, and let my Redeemer's merits plead in my behalf.” Thus did this pious young lady fly for relief in the moments of affliction to the consolations of religion, and found it. Her mind became considerably calmed, although not sufficiently so to permit her to enjoy the salutary repose, which her agitated frame much needed, of “Nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep.” During the course of the night, the distracting idea of becoming the wife of a man whom she could not esteem, perpetually obtruded itself on her imagination; but as she could see no earthly means of avoiding it, without absolutely rebelling against the authority of her grandfather, which her habits of duty and her feelings of affection towards him, who except on this occasion, had always treated her with extreme tenderness and affection, altogether forbade, she resolved with as much fortitude as she could command, to submit to her uncontrollable destiny. The struggle, however, which took place in her mind while forming this resolution, was too great for her harrassed frame, and her aunt on visiting her in the morning, found her in a high fever. “My dear child,” said that affectionate relative, “what is the matter? what has occasioned this?” “Best of my friends,” she replied, “my only mother, do not grieve for me. My grandfather has desired me in eight days to prepare my mind for becoming Sir Geoffrey's wife. I have had a hard struggle to do so. But the worst is now over. I will yield to his wishes. It is my duty, although death itself should be the consequence. I feel I shall not survive it; for O my stubborn heart has become the property of another, and I cannot, cannot help it.” “My dearest Ellen be comforted,” said Mrs. Brown, “your grandfather will not, cannot persist in such harshness. I know your happiness to be dearer to him than his own. He will withdraw this cruel mandate. I will reason with him, I will remonstrate with him, I will show him the cruelty of his conduct, the absurdity of consulting your welfare by breaking your heart.” “Kindest of relatives,” replied Ellen, “while thus sympathising with me, your tenderness soothes my spirits. I shall soon get better. But I do not expect you will succeed in changing my grandfather's resolution. No, I know he will persevere. He thinks it his duty, and to that he will cause every other consideration to yield.” “But dearest, patient, suffering girl,” said her aunt, “it is my duty to open his eyes to your true interest. I shall this very hour let him know the worthlessness of the man's character, who has deluded him into the unfortunate opinion that he would make you a good husband. I know more of that man's demerits than even you do, and I earnestly dissuade you from consenting to become his wife.” “Only make my refusal consistent with what I owe to my grandfather,” replied Ellen, “and I shall bless you, for you will save me from destruction.” Mrs. Brown went in search of O'Halloran, whom she found writing in his study. He laid down his pen when she entered. “Sister,” said he, “I want to disburden my mind to you on a subject, on which I know you will feel strongly interested. Sir Geoffrey Carebrow, who has essentially promoted the interests of our cause in this part of the country, by the pecuniary aid which he so promptly afforded us, has laid me under such obligations, that I can refuse him nothing in my power honourably to grant. You know he has long solicited the hand of my granddaughter; but owing to some unfortunate predilection which, I believe, she entertains for Mr. Barrymore, she obstinately refuses him. He has been so extremely urgent of late, that last night I was induced to lay my injunctions on her to prepare her mind in eight days to receive him. I know if she consents, which her sense of duty towards me, I expect will induce her to do, that she will offer some violence to her own feelings. But as this violence will only last while her prepossession in favour of Barrymore remains; and which can only be until she becomes better acquainted with Sir Geoffrey's worth, I think her permanent interests will be consulted by bringing about this union. On leaving her last night, I assure you, I felt extremely grieved at being obliged to address her in such an authoritative manner. But I perceived that nothing short of an exertion of authority would do. It was painful; but I did exert it; and must continue to do so, until this union, on which I have so fully set my heart, is accomplished.” “And why, my brother,” asked Mrs. Brown, “have you so fully set your heart on this union?” “I have strong reasons for doing so,” replied her brother. “Ellen's own ultimate advantage is one, and you will readily suppose, not a slight one with me. Sir Geoffrey loves her to distraction; and will, I am persuaded, make her a good husband. I am bound to him by strong gratitude for the pecuniary assistance already mentioned; for had we not, at that time, received it, we should not have been in that state of preparation, in which we now are for taking the field, whenever the French auxiliaries arrive, who are expected in April or May next. He has shown his disinterestedness in this case; or rather he has shown a noble union of love and patriotism, by stipulating to place the mortgage deed, by which the money has been secured, at her disposal, as her own property, whenever she shall become his wife. This is equivolent to bestowing the money on the cause of the people; for the lands so mortgaged, I intended solely for her use at any rate. Hence on reasoning with myself, to ascertain my proper course of action, I concluded, that my duty to Sir Geoffrey, the benefactor of our country, had superior claims on my regard, than my inclination, which, I confess, would induce me to indulge my daughter's wishes, or, as I should rather say, prejudices on this subject.” “My brother,” said Mrs. Brown, “I make no doubt that you have reasoned correctly enough on this subject, from what you know of this man's character; and that your decision has been conscientious, I am perfectly convinced, for your decisions have never been otherwise. But, I believe, that if you thoroughly knew this man, your determination would be very different, you would never resolve to force your dear and only child, who has ever been so obedient and affectionate to you, into the possession of a sensualist and a miser, a libertine in morals, a sceptic in religion, and of late, a hypocrite in politics; whose ruling passions are lust and avarice.—His passion for our child has of late obtained the mastery over even his cherished avarice, and the seeming readiness with which he assisted your cause, was nothing but a bribe to secure your support to his wishes. As to the condition which he has admitted into the deeds, I can see no real generosity in it. It was, I believe, only a lure to gain, if possible, the good opinion of Ellen, and, perhaps, also to acquire a stronger hold on your esteem. He loses nothing by it; he secures your estate at all events; and he thought he might as well, at the same time, by an appearance of liberality, secure the good-will of his intended wife. Hence, he has merely exhibited the shadow without the least substance of generosity. Ah! Sir, I and many others know this man too well, to believe that there is the smallest particle of generosity in his disposition; and as to patriotism, he is as destitute of such a noble feeling, as I am of the power of necromancy. In lending you this money, he has taken care to have it not only well secured, but to earn by it yearly four per cent. more than he could have done had he lent it any where else. This, one should think, savours more of avarice than of either generosity or patriotism.” “In requiring ten per cent.” replied O'Halloran, warmly, “Sir Geoffrey committed no crime. Your rigid sticklers for the ancient and corrupt laws of Britain, may call him a usurer, but men of rational philosophical understandings, will never place a maximum on the value of money more than on other commodities. Sir Geoffrey has had the greatness of mind to act in defiance of antiquated rules and customs; but he has asked no more for the use of his money, than I think him entitled to considering the risk he runs on account of the hazardous complexion of the times, and considering also the great service his promptitude has rendered the cause of the country. I am sorry to see that more minds than Ellen's have imbibed an unwarrantable prejudice against my friend. He is called a libertine, because, until he met with a female with whom he thought he could live happy, he did not choose to marry; and no doubt evil and lying reports to the disadvantage of his chastity, may have been circulated; and because he possesses an immense fortune, and will not spend it in frivolity, or live in imitation of aristocratical splendour and extravagance, but prefers patriarchal plainness and republican simplicity, he is called a miser. Such may be the opinion of an unthinking and unjust world. But it is not from such a criterion that I estimate men's characters. I am in the habit, Mrs. Brown, of examining and judging for myself; ay, and of determining for myself too, and my determination on this affair is already fixed. Ellen is my child—and me she must obey, until Sir Geoffrey Carebrow obtains a prior right to her obedience.” Here Mrs. Brown burst into tears. “I weep” said she, when she had some what recovered from her emotion, “for your delusion. But, ah! I weep more for the misery, which, I perceive, awaits your unfortunate child—O my brother, reflect”— “I will hear no more,” said O'Halloran, “lest you stagger my resolution, which, as it is founded on reason, I am determined shall never be shakes by feeling.” He then hastily left the room, evidently as much agitated as Mrs. Brown herself. The allotted eight days elapsed, and Ellen consented to become a victim; “for,” said she, “I will die before I disobey him.” Oh! my grandfather, did you know what I this moment, suffer, you would have compassion on me!” She was able to speak no more: she had fainted. In great consternation, O'Halloran and Sir Geoffrey called for assistance; for they had been both present urging her to compliance. She soon recovered, and on seeing her restored, the strength of her grandfather's determination, which her swoon had somewhat shaken, was also restored, and the day was appointed for the marriage. The agitation of Ellen's mind now greatly subsided. She had nothing more for which to hope, and she awaited the awful hour in the calm silence of despair. Her aunt was her only comforter; but she also stood in need of comfort. At her request, Miss Agnew was invited to the castle, to encourage and support her afflicted friend, through the horrors of the approaching ceremony. On understanding the circumstances of the case, all the sprightliness of this lively young woman forsook her; and, although she would not desert her friend, she determined to partake of no festivity on the occasion. “It will be a wedding” said she to O'Halloran, “that ought to be solemnized as a funeral, with the emblems of grief, for it will be death to the happiness of the loveliest maiden in the land.” “I trust not,” he replied; “the consciousness of doing her duty, will of itself be a source of happiness, and her husband's worth, tenderness and affectionate assiduities, will soon obliterate this unreasonable, girlish prejudice against him, which occasions her present distress. We shall yet see her the happy, loving wife of a worthy man.” “In that case, she will not be the wife of this man,” retorted Miss Agnew, with something of her usual keenness and levity, mingled with bitterness and grief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XVIII. Then in that hour remorse he felt, And his heart told him he had dealt Unkindly with his child: A father may a while refuse; But who can for another choose. Would'st thou, presumptuous as thou art, O'er nature play the tyrant's part, And with the hand compel the heart! Oh! rather, rather hope to bind The ocean wave the mountain wind; Or fix the feet upon the ground, To stop the planet rolling round. Byron. On the second day previous to that appointed for the marriage, the Recluse came to the castle, and requested an interview with Ellen. He was admitted into her chamber, for she was too unwell to leave it. She was alone. He was shocked at the alteration which a few weeks had made in her appearance. She who so lately was blooming in the luxuriance of health and beauty, now appeared before him the image of death, pale and emaciated, and sunk in almost speechless sorrow. His heart smote him. “I have neglected thee too long, suffering innocence,” said he; “but if heaven permits thee to live, it is not yet too late to save thee from misery.” “Father, what wouldst thou say?” she asked, scarcely understanding him. “My child, if this dreaded marriage be the cause of thy affliction, I will deliver thee from it,” he replied. “Ah! thou canst not,” said she, “unless my grandfather withdraws his injunctions, for I will obey him.” “Thy grandfather will never enjoin thee to be wretched,” said he. “Alas! sir, he does enjoin it.” “Then, disobey him,” exclaimed the Recluse, with energy, “O thou best of daughters, and the sin be on my head!” “What sayest thou?” cried she, starting, “Wouldst thou counsel me to disobedience?” “I would, and will save thee from ruin,” he replied. “Yea, at the foot of the altar, if I found thee there, I would snatch thee from the contaminating touch of the viper who has deluded thy grandfather, and would make thee his own to make thee wretched. No, never shall that saint who bore thee, sweet, suffering maiden, accuse thy father of standing by in heedless apathy, to see thee immolated! That father, thy own father, my child, has the first claim on thy obedience; and he forbids thee as thou wouldst value his blessing, to become the wife of Sir Geoffrey Carebrow.” “What! Oh sir,” she cried, “does my father live? Does he know of my misfortunes? Am I, indeed, so happy?” “He lives,” said the Recluse. “He knows of thy sufferings; and no danger will prevent him from rescuing, and protecting thee. For what other end does he, can he live?” “Oh! sir, where, when shall I see him? Where shall I fly to him? Only let me embrace him, and I will bless thee.” “Yes; beloved of my heart,” he returned. “Daughter of my Eliza! thou shalt embrace him. The terrors of law shall no longer prevent it. Behold thy father in this disguise! I once saved thee from insult; I shall now snatch thee from wretchedness. Embrace me, my only child!” “Oh father,” cried she, straining him to her bosom; “Why did I not know thee sooner. O God! thou art merciful—my father lives! Now let me die in his arms, since I have indeed seen him. I am no longer an orphan.” Here her head sunk on his breast; for the shock of her joy was almost too powerful for her debilitated frame. “God preserve thee, child of my love! Darling of my heart,” he cried, alarmed at the changing hue of her countenance. “Am I to loose thee, in the moment thou hast found me? Art thou to be unhappy both in joy and in sorrow?” A gush of tears from his eyes fell upon her countenance. But in the agitation of joy, although the first shock may resemble that of grief, yet the difference of its effects on the frame, is soon apparent. In place of exhausting it soon invigorates. The rays of delight soon sparkled from her dark eyes; and the flush of joy again beamed on her countenance. “It is enough,” cried she. “Kind heaven! I thank thee. I cannot now be unhappy. Take me with thee, my father. Let me live alone under thy protection.” He now explained to her the necessity for his remaining concealed, on account of a sentence of outlawry under which he lay, for having killed Sir Nicholas Carebrow, the elder brother of this Sir Geoffrey, in a duel. “He persecuted thy mother,” said he, “with a disgusting and criminal passion, as his brother, almost his equal in wickedness, has persecuted thee. To avenge an insulted, virtuous and tenderly beloved wife, I fought him, and his death was the expiation of his offence. His friends raised a prosecution against me. I was obliged to fly. By their influence, I have been outlawed, and if this true heir to his brother's wickedness, as well as his T 2 title and estates, should discover that it was your father that thwarted his designs on you, he would prosecute me with the relentless rancour of disappointed passion. I should have either to leave the country and once more deprive you of my protection, or become the victim of his revenge.” “Oh! my father,” said she, “I will save thee. I will have thee restored to me. I will deliver myself to him; I will become his—Oh! can I, can I name it?—yet it is for a father's safety—I will become his wife, on condition that he shall cancel this prosecution, and procures a reversal of the outlawry.” “No, my child! You shall not make such a sacrifice. None of my blood, I trust, shall ever be allied to such a wicked and unprincipled family. Should such a misfortune take place, all my satisfaction in this world would be at an end. Better I should die than see such a day! In my present concealment, I am safe, and in residing so near you, I am happy. I would have discovered myself to you sooner; but I found you happy in the love and under protection of your grandfather; and I did not wish to disturb your tranquillity, by apprising you of my danger in residing here.” “Father! be it as you will. Wisdom speaks from your lips. Instruct me in your wishes. It is my duty, and it shall be my study not to controvert, but to obey. Even though my venerated but mistaken grandfather should force me to the altar, I will there perish, ere the irrevocable vow which consigns me to your enemy, shall pass my lips.” “Blessed girl, image of thy sainted mother! your grandfather will not urge you. I shall, this evening, send you a letter inclosing one to him, which by showing him that there is still in existence, one who has superior claims to your obedience, and who forbids your compliance in this affair, will make it his duty to relinquish his authority; and, you know, the moment your grandfather perceives his duty, that he will perform it. In the meantime, adieu, my daughter! Be comforted. I am safe, and thou shalt be protected. May the blessing of heaven be ever thine!” and straining her to his paternal bosom, he left her in a transport of joy and gratitude to God for her deliverance. On her knees she addressed the Author of all good, and poured forth the fulness of her delighted and grateful heart for this signal instance of his merciful interposition in her favour. When her aunt and Miss Agnew visited her, they were surprised to find her so cheerful. “Dear Ellen,” asked her aunt “are you really become satisfied, for you appear as if you were, with this match?” “This match shall never take place,” she replied, “it is this which causes my satisfaction.” “Indeed!” said Miss Agnew—“Has your grandfather at last relented. The first time I find him dozing in his elbow chair I shall kiss him for his goodness.” “I thought” said Mrs. Brown, “that obstinate as he appeared, he could not carry his cruelty so far.” “My dear friends,” said Ellen, interrupting her aunt, “you mistake. He has not yet relented, but he will relent. I dare not at present tell you more. To-morrow, perhaps to-night, I may be free to tell you all. In the meantime, be assured that this hateful marriage will not take place, neither shall I have any occasion to infringe upon my duty to my grandfather.” “Heaven be praised for such an escape!” cried Miss Agnew. “We shall again be as merry as crickets; and laugh at the old curmudgeon of a disappointed knight. What had an old half rotten fellow of fifty, to do with a fresh blooming damsel of nineteen? It was truly abominable.” The buoyancy of this young lady's spirits now burst forth unrestrained, as if to make amends for their late depression; and she had wrought her companions into such a state of good humour, when O'Halloran entered towards the evening, that he was both surprised and delighted. “You are, at last, reconciled, my dear Ellen?” said he “to this indispensable measure?” “Obedience to your commands, shall always yield me pleasure,” she replied. Before he could answer, a servant entered with a letter for Ellen, which, he said, a stranger had just brought to the castle. On opening it, she found one enclosed for O'Halloran. “I expected this,” said she, as she handed it to him, “only within these few hours. I believe it will reveal to you the cause of my present satisfaction. I have received intelligence that my father lives and prohibits my marriage with Sir Geoffrey Carebrow.” O'Halloran broke the seal and read as follows: “Worthy and revered father of my Eliza, Nothing short of parental regard for my daughter's happiness, induces me to address you at present, or to interfere with an arrangement which I understand you have made, no doubt from the best of motives, for settling her in the marriage state. “It is said, that contrary to her inclinations, you have urged her, and obtained her consent, to become the wife of Sir Geoffrey Carebrow. By the authority of a father, I have commanded her never to receive the hand of that man, whom I know to be the worthless inheritor of all his brother's baseness and wickedness. I am sorry to learn that with a view to the accomplishment of his desires with respect to my daughter, he has, by a feigned patriotism, succeeded in impressing you with a favourable opinion of his character. But on the word of whom you never knew to utter a falsehood, I assure you that his patriotism is hypocricy, and his pecuniary accommodations to your cause, artifice. “It is not from any want of confidence in either your honour or your friendship, that I refrain from discovering to you at present my place of residence; it is from a fear that such a disclosure might involve us into a correspondence, which, by some accident, might be the means of making me known to my enemies; and after my present interference, which I do not wish concealed from Sir Geoffrey, you will perceive that there will be an increased necessity for precaution on my part; for should lie now discover me, he would be goaded on by the implacable rancour of revenge for the disappointment I have occasioned him, to bring down, without mercy, that penalty which the law now holds suspended over me for his brother's death. A time may come, and I hope it is at no great distance, when I shall with safety be publicly acknowledged by my friends. Till then, cherish my daughter as you have hitherto cherished her. But withdraw, I conjure you, as you value her, or your own peace of mind, that command, in obedience to which she has consented to marry a man she detests, and who deserves her detestation. “Should you persist in urging her to this match, which I cannot believe you will, by that prior authority which nature has given me over her, I command her to disobey you. I peremptorily enjoin her, as she values a father's love, never in wedlock to bestow herself on Sir Geoffrey Carebrow. “Receive my thanks for the tenderness with which, until this occasion, you have ever treated my child, and assure yourself that I am as heretofore, your dutiful and affectionate “FRANCIS HAMILTON.” When O'Halloran had finished reading this letter, silence for a few minutes ensued. The ladies were struck dumb with amazement. At length he approached Ellen. “My child,” said he, “I rejoice that your father still lives. He was a worthy man, notwithstanding his unhappy duel. His interference on this occasion is, perhaps, fortunate. At all events it relieves me from any responsibility as to the result. I shall inform Sir Geoffrey, that I no longer possess the requisite authority to constrain your acceptance of him. I see you are all gratified. I confess that I am not much displeased myself, at the turn this affair has taken. He then withdrew. The reader need not be detained with an account of the felicitations which Ellen received from her female confidents on this occasion. Any sensible good hearted aunt can easily imagine how Mrs. Brown expressed herself, and any lively good natured young maiden, may do the same with respect to Miss Agnew. It may be recorded, however, that this young lady observed, that she never saw O'Halloran smile so bewitchingly as when he left the room. “Where he only thirty or forty years younger,” said she, “I should certainly fall in love with him for that sweet smile. As it is, however, I shall certainly have the kiss that I threatened to steal from him, the first time I should find him asleep in his elbow chair.” Immediately on leaving the ladies, O'Halloran despatched a messenger to Sir Geoffrey, requesting his attendance at the castle as early as convenient the next morning. On his arrival he acquainted him with what had taken place. “I thought it right,” he observed, “to lose no time in giving you this information, that you might be occasioned no disappointment in your arrangement for the solemnity, that I could prevent.” With eyes flashing fire, Sir Geoffrey started to his feet. “Then you withdraw all controul over your granddaughter in this case?” he demanded. “I do”—was the laconic and firm reply.—“And Francis Hamilton, my brother's murderer, is now in the country,” exclaimed the rejected knight, “and has caused this; but I shall find him, and dreadful will be my revenge.” O'Halloran was thunder-struck at such a manifestation of malignity in the man he had lately so much esteemed. He fixed his eyes steadfastly on Carebrow, and with inexpressible dignity, calmly said, “Is this the disinterested affection you professed to bear for my granddaughter? You would show your love for her by the destruction of her father? Sir Geoffrey resumed his seat. He remained a few moments absorbed in reflection. He saw that O'Halloran was not a man to be frightened; and concluded that he would play a surer game by pretending to submit calmly to his misfortune. “I am wrong,” said he, “my friend. Excuse the impetuosity of my feelings. They are agonized by the intelligence you have given me. The warmth of my expression was occasioned by the madness of my disappointed love. But I submit. My anger was but momentary. From this instant, I shall cast the remembrance of the whole affair from my mind. But there is one piece of information,” said he, somewhat sarcastically, “which, in my turn, I will lose no time in communicating, lest you, in some of your arrangements, should also be disappointed. I find it inconvenient to pay you the remaining twenty thousand pounds contracted for in the mortgage.” “That is unfortunate,” replied O'Halloran, “for there is now little time to raise it elsewhere.” “The cause must then do without it,” said the other. “It will greatly cripple our exertions;” continued O'Halloran; “besides the sum being secured in the mortgage, you should in honour exert yourself to procure it, or else allow that instrument to be altered.” “As to that,” said Sir Geoffrey, “the less that is either said or written on such dangerous matters, in these troublesome times, the better. The mortgage cannot be altered. But do not think that I intend to defraud you. Only, now that I think of it, our communications this evening have been mutually disagreeable. We had better, therefore, end the conference. Good night; and recollect that by withholding my bride, you have lost only twenty thousand pounds.” The man's real character now stared O'Halloran full in the face. He scorned to detain him, or reason with him. He, therefore, let him go without interruption, rejoiced that the good fortune of his beloved grandchild, had preserved her from becoming the wife of such a man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XIX. Lady there's danger in the way, A villain wants thee for his prey; His hireling ruffians skulking lie, Watching the time with thee to fly; To him they've sworn to seize thy charms, And force thee to his loathsome arms. But go, nor fear what they can do, A faithful knight is near thee too. Thaunus the Druid. When O'Halloran informed the other chiefs of the conspiracy, of Sir Geoffrey's threat, they agreed to make no noise about it, least by irritating a person so unprincipled, he might be induced to inform against them to the government. To discover on the United Irishmen, was, indeed, the first impulse that actuated this man's mind on his rupture with O'Halloran, but he was prevented by his cowardice—the fate of M`Bride terrified him. Besides he was not sure (for he was a man of no political sagacity) which of the two parties might in the end prevail. He was, therefore, unwilling to provoke either. With respect to Ellen, his passion was not in the least diminished. He was so far from relinquishing his views upon her, that it now became his chief study, how to effect by fraud or violence, what he could not by fair and friendly means. It was supposed, by Ellen's friends, that amusement and change of scene would contribute to remove from her mind the impression of her late sufferings, and hasten the restoration of her health and spirits. She was, therefore, prevailed on to accompany Miss Agnew on a visit to the residence U of her father. It was in the afternoon of a beautiful day in April, when they set out in a one horse chair. The whispering wind waved gently over hill and valley with a balmy, genial softness, which rendered the atmosphere delightful; while the sun diffused a kindly fertilizing warmth into the bosom of the joyous earth, which produced a luxuriant, beauteous and fragrant vegetation all over its surface. The fields, the groves and the hedgerows were bursting into life; and all nature was assuming her gay and green attire, while animation, joy and gratitude, inspired the harmonious effusions of the feathered race; and seemed to awaken corresponding emotions in the hearts of the country people, as they alternately whistled and sang at their rural employments. The season and the scenery recalled to Ellen's memory, some simple verses she had lately received of M`Nelvin's composition; and as they rode along a fine road at an easy rate, she indulged the curiosity of her companion by repeating them. A SONG FOR SPRING. TUNE—Gramachree. See, Mary dear, how mild the eve; No storms molest the plain: At length stern winter calmly yields To spring's propitious reign. To mark the year's reviving sweets, We'll to you upland rove;— Hail Spring! fair queen of tender joys, And meekly-smiling love. Freed from its chains, behold the brook Winds briskly through the vale; Upon its banks, the tender grass Yields balm to every gale: The daisy, primrose, violet, there Are richly interwove; Hail Spring! fair queen of tender joys, And meekly-smiling love. The flocks and herds, that graze the mead, And sip the falling dew: Touch'd with the vernal influence sweet, Instinctive sports pursue: Gay chirls the plover, hoarse and loud, And softly cooes the dove; Hail Spring! fair queen of tender joys, And meekly-smiling love. The blackbird, thrush and linnet tribes, In yonder grove convene, And in glad concert join their notes, To celebrate the scene: Their little love-sick cares and joys, Harmonious raptures move; Hail Spring! fair queen of tender joys, And meekly-smiling love. This morn, dear Mary, had you heard The lark ascending sing; The distant sun-gilt hills rejoiced, And blushed the face of spring; Your heart with mine, had softly beat, And kind emotions strove: Hail Spring! fair queen of tender joys, And meekly-smiling love. With careful steps, and hopeful heart, As o'er the earth he past, The farmer blithe, his golden grain, Into its bosom cast; While slow, before the crashing team, The whistling plough-boy drove: Hail Spring! fair queen of tender joys, And meekly-smiling love. Then, as the briary bush I leaped, A thrush out, shuddering, flew; I spied her eggs, and half-resolved To bear the prize to you; But no; the cruel gift, I cried, Her heart will scorn to prove: Hail Spring! fair queen of tender joys, And meekly-smiling love. Of youngest ivy then a wreath, For your fair brows I twined; With loveliest flowers adorned it round, And softest foliage lined; A purer emblem of the vows, I made in yonder grove: Hail Spring! fair queen of tender joys, And meekly-smiling love. 'Tis in the woodbine thicket hid, Where love you first confessed; 'Twas such a beauteous night as this, In nature's gladness dressed; Come, there I'll fit it to your brows, While passing swains approve: Hail Spring! fair queen of tender joys, And meekly-smiling love. There oft of old, Hiberman hards Have sat, and sweetly sung; Oft to th' inspiring charms of Spring, Their magic harps they strung: They swept the chords with pathos strong, Descended from above: Hail Spring! fair queen of tender joys, And meekly-smiling love. Ellen had scarcely finished the recital of these verses, when, in a lonely part of the road, adjoining a wood, a stranger on horseback overtook them, and addressed them in a vulgar tone, and with a face of great affrontery. “A bonnie day, ladies! Do you gang far this way?” “Only a few miles,” was the reply of Miss Agnew; and for a short space all were again silent. At length another unknown horseman rode forward and exclaimed, “Damn you, Jack, why dont you stop the driver? We have no time to lose.” Jack now drew a pistol from his pocket, and presenting it at the driver, ordered him to stop. He was obeyed. “Miss O'Halloran,” said the man who last came forward, “my employer desires the pleasure of your company to night; but being afraid that you would not come willingly, he ordered us to bring you by force. You will be pleased to get behind me, and let that other lady proceed by herself.— Confound your screaming!—Gag them, Jack, or they'll alarm the whole country. Tear them from each other.” This was scarcely uttered when he was levelled to the ground by a tremendous blow of a large stick, which resounded from his head with a noise that startled the terrified ladies. Jack immediately discharged his pistol at the assailant; but the ball missed its object; and had he not instantly put spurs to his horse, he would have been the next moment as low as his companion. “Let him go,” cried the victor, turning to the affrighted ladies. “He will not molest you again this evening.” “Ellen now recovered sufficiently from her terror to recognise the Green Minstrel in her deliverer.” “Fair lady!” said he, addressing her, and holding the shamrock wreath in his hand, “behold a man who has sworn eternal servitude to you. On the night you decorated his brow with this badge of your favour, he pledged himself to watch over and guard you, with all the zeal and assiduity of devoted knighthood; and this day has afforded him the first opportunity of proving his fidelity.” “Tell me, tell me, kind and noble youth,” said she, “to whom I am so much indebted?” “My fair mistress,” replied the youth, “indulge my wish for concealment for some time. You shall know me at a more convenient season. Beware of Carebrow. 'Tis his villany has occasioned this scene; but I shall watch him. Meantime drive on, and fear nothing. Should you again be attacked, I shall not be far off. Adieu!” and he hastily disappeared in the adjoining wood. Having only about two miles further to ride, by a pretty smart application of his whip, which the driver now thought proper to make, they soon arrived U 2 at the residence of John Agnew, Esq. the father of Ellen's companion. When this outrage was communicated to the united chiefs, not one of them doubted but that Sir Geoffrey was its author. They indeed soon had reason to withdraw all their confidence from him; for they received intelligence that he had made great professions of loyalty at a late public dinner given by the friends of government in Belfast; that he had, since his dispute with O'Halloran, purchased a large amount of government debentures, and was in daily expectation of being put into the commission of the peace. At the latter end of April, therefore, they held a consultation concerning him, at which it was resolved to seize his person, and confine him in their cave, before he should have time to do them mischief by the disclosures which they doubted not he would willingly make to the government. While the chiefs were assembled at this consultation, they received despatches from Dublin, by express, containing news of a most disastrous description, which rendered it necessary for them, and for all the United Societies in the kingdom, to adopt measures of the most decisive nature. They were informed that, in consequence of one Reynolds having betrayed them, the most active members of their National Directory had been seized and imprisoned by the government; that Lord Edward Fitgerald, their leader, had been so severely wounded in the attempt to arrest him that he had since died—that Oliver Bond, Henry and John Sheares, Thomas Addis Emmet, and Dr. M`Nevin were committed to close confinement, until the formation of a special commission to try them for high treason, should be completed. They were, therefore, urged to make a grand effort either to rescue these leaders, or to seize a number of the government party as hostages for their safety. As this could not be done, however, without an absolute insurrection, they were exhorted to be ready for that measure by the beginning of June, the trial of the captured chiefs not being expected to come on before the middle of that month. Samuel Nelson, who was now in Dublin, and at the death of lord Fitzgerald, had been appointed to the chief management of their affairs, informed them that he should immediately despatch a messenger to France, to hasten the arrival of the promised succours; and that for the purpose of rendering the rising as simultaneous as possible in all parts of the country, he had directed it to take place every where on the third day after information should be received of the stoppage of the different mail coaches proceeding from the metropolis, which should be the signal of an attack having been made there. All was now bustle and activity among the conspirators. Messengers were sent to every influential United Irishman in the country. Nightly assemblages for drilling the peasantry in the art of war, were held more extensively and frequently; and every smith who had joined the confederacy, became busily employed in the manufacture of pikes, and in the repairing of muskets and other kinds of warlike instruments. So high indeed did the excitement for insurrection become at this period, that even many of the softer sex employed themselves in casting bullets, preparing cartridges, and making cockades and insurrectionary banners. The immediate object of O'Halloran, was to collect an additional supply of gunpowder, an article in which his district was deficient. The greater portion of what had been purchased by Sir Geoffrey's money, having been distributed throughout the adjoining counties. This distribution had been readily yielded to by O'Halloran's immediate colleagues, in reliance on being able, on account of their proximity to the sea, to procure an abundant and timely supply for themselves, with the sum which Sir Geoffrey, according to his contract, had yet to furnish them. Sore with their disappointment, they now breathed vengeance on the defaulter; and had he fallen into the hands of M`Cauley, Kelly, Darragh, or any other of the more desperate of the party, his life would have paid the forfeit of his delinquency. He, however, having lately become a magistrate, and knowing that for that reason as well as several others of a more heinous nature, he had become obnoxious to his former friends, he confined himself as much as possible to his seat at Carebrow-hall, which he had the precaution to keep well guarded, by supplying his domestics with arms, and ordering them every night to hold alternate watch, for fear of a surprise. One evening he would have been destroyed by Darragh and Kelly, who were indefatigable in watching for an opportunity for that purpose, contrary to the desire of their leaders, who did not at this crisis, wish the attention of the government to be excited by any such outrage. He was returning home from Carrickfergus, attended by two servants, (for he never at this time ventured abroad without such attendance,) when coming to the border of his demesne, he ordered them to catch a favourite colt, which had broken out of an enclosure, and was playing at large on the high road. They obeyed, and he rode alone towards the house. Darragh and Kelly were lying in wait for him in the shrubbery that skirted the public avenue, which led to the house. They were perceived by a lad about fourteen years of age, named Nelson, who knew their design; but who, on account of Carebrow having arbitrarily turned his mother, who was a widow, and her family, of which he was the eldest, out of their little holding, at the most inclement season of the preceding winter, hated him. Persuaded now that vengeance would be inflicted on the oppressor, in the excitement of the moment, he called prematurely from a tree on which he was stationed; “There, Darragh! there comes the tyrant. Now have at him.” Carebrow both heard and saw Nelson, and instantly took the alarm. He put spurs to his horse, which darting over a low clipt hedge into an open lawn, carried him at full flight towards the house. Darragh and Kelly being only armed with pistols and bayonets, conceived it imprudent to fire, as there would be little chance of hitting him, and the report would alarm his servants, and render their escape difficult. They fled immediately without making any further attempt upon him, but heartily cursing Nelson for giving him the alarm. It was, indeed, as we shall afterwards have occasion to narrate, an unfortunate incident for Nelson, resulting to him in a most melancholy catastrophe. As will be readily supposed, wrath and revenge were highly inflamed in the mind of Sir Geoffrey on this occasion; but their effects with respect to the United Irishmen were suppressed by the force of his terrors; and although he was now in the commission of the peace, and might have issued warrants for their apprehension and imprisonment, he feared their party too much to give them such provocation. He knew not but that they might in the end, overthrow their opponents, and in that case, he wished still to keep a door open for reconciliation with them. He, therefore, although he knew the Darragh whom Nelson addressed when he gave him the alarm, dared not add to the irritation of the conspirators, by having him, or any other of their associates, apprehended. If the government should maintain its authority, this forbearance not being publicly known, would not injure him in its estimation; while, in the event of the United Irishmen being successful, it might be pleaded as a merit by which he might hope to regain their favour, at least their forgiveness. This unsteady vacillating conduct, this endeavouring to stand well with both parties, was adopted by a numerous portion of the Irish population at this period. Some from mere timidity were entirely neutral; others from a mixture of ambition and cowardice, wished to be considered friendly by both parties, and accordingly, in a covert manner, occasionally lent assistance to both. So that, in the vulgar phrase, possessing two strings to their bow, which ever party prevailed, they were sure to be gainers. Sir Geoffrey, however, had offended the conspirators too deeply to be forgiven on account of mere forbearance towards them. But he was not altogether certain of this. He knew that they were dissatisfied and enraged at his conduct; but he did not believe that they were irreconcilably so. He, therefore, conceived it to be his interest, while he acted so as to merit the favour of the government, to give the opposite party no cause to think him their decided enemy. His ungovernable passion for Ellen alone interfered with this wise resolution. He could not be happy without the enjoyment of those beauties, on which he had so long feasted his imagination. The cup of bliss had approached too near his lips, and had been too suddenly and unexpectedly dashed from them, to be easily forgotten and relinquished. He was resolved, therefore, to make another effort to possess it. He knew that he was suspected for the outrage that had already been committed on her, and that consequently, the eyes of her numerous friends and connexions would be immediately directed towards him, if she were subjected to another. He felt, however, that at all hazards, he must possess her; but to succeed, and to succeed with safety, required that the attempt should be conducted, not only with great dexterity, but with great privacy. That he was foiled in his last attempt, he attributed to its having been so publicly made, in the face of day, and on the open road. “She shall be mine,” said he to himself, “if there be power in gold to hire assistants, and strength in steel to render them successful!” He had several conferences with one Philip Berwick, his game-keeper, who had often procured handsome young women for his service. It was this man and Tim Rodgers, another of his domestics, who had been his instrument in the former attempt to seize Ellen, and who for a handsome reward, notwithstanding his disaster in that affair, (for it was he who had fallen under the stroke of the Green Minstrel,) was ready to renew the under-taking in what ever way he should be directed. At length their conferences resulted in the adoption of the following plan. One of Sir Geoffrey's tenants, whose rent he attempted to raise, had a few months before, relinquished his farm, which, as nobody else thought it worth the sum he demanded for it, was now unoccupied. On this place there was a tolerably comfortable dwelling house, in a very retired situation, to which it was determined forcibly to bring Ellen, as it was believed that she could be there effectually concealed, until circumstances should permit Sir Geoffrey to carry her to an estate which he possessed in Gloucestershire, in England.</field>

Teeming with forms his terror grew; Heedful he watched, for well he knew That in that dark and devious dell Some ling'ring ghosts and spirits dwell, So as he trow'd, so it befel. Hogg. Ellen was still on her visit at Mr. Agnew's, and had recovered all her usual bloom of health and serenity of mind. She, indeed, still felt some apprehension, lest the continuance of Sir Geoffrey's passion should find out some means of disturbing her repose; but as her friends were numerous and vigilant, she confided in their zeal and ability to protect her, and did not permit this apprehension to repress the natural cheerfulness of her temper, or damp the joy she experienced from the discovery of her father, from her own deliverance from the persecutions of her tormentor, and her rescue from the violence of his menials. The brave author of this rescue, her Green Minstrel, her Shamrock Knight, was never absent from her thoughts. “Ah!” said she to Miss Agnew, “if this young man were to reveal himself, I fear that my Edward would possess only the first share in my affections. I do not know how it is; but I almost feel as if I had two hearts, one to bestow on each of these objects, for (I am, indeed, ashamed to confess it,) this noble youth intrudes himself on my mind almost as often and as intensely as he to whom my first affections have been pledged, and to whom they must be forever faithful. O! would to Heaven, that he were Edward, or Edward he!” “You have started an odd notion into my mind,” said her companion, “that they are, indeed, the same person. If they are not, they must be twins; for now when I think of them, I protest that you two stars do not more resemble each other.” This conversation took place one evening about the beginning of May, as these two young ladies walked together to visit a poor, sick man, who lived in the neighbourhood. The cause of this man's sickness being somewhat singular, and connected with the state of the times, and the popular superstitions of the country, it may be here related. On the day previous to the visit just mentioned, Andrew Ramsey, the name of the sick man, had been on some business at a small village in the neighbourhood of Carebrow-hall. He had spent the afternoon in the enjoyment of the bottle, with some free-hearted convivial acquaintances he had met with in a Shabeen house, near the village, and who being, like himself, a United Irishman, were of course, deeply versed in the politics of the times, and fond of talking on the subject. Here it was, that Andrew was first told of the intended rising in June, and was desired to hold himself in readiness to take the field with his companions. As Andrew was not one of the most courageous of men, this news together with the accompanying requisition, struck, like a leaden bolt, upon his spirits, and it was with great difficulty that he kept them from betraying his fears, by the inspiring force of the potent liquor that he now copiously drank. The shades of evening were fast gathering, and the time approached when Andrew must part with his cup and his company. With a doleful countenance he shook his comrades severally by the hand. “Farewell, friends!” said he, “it's likely to be X a serious time in the lan'. I wish God may preserve us through the strife. We should be a' busy praying an' preparing against the warst.” “By G—d! man, I doobt you'll greet aboot it. Fight first, an' gin you like, pray next,” said an' irreverend fellow of the name of Steele, who had lately become a convert to the age of reason system, and had thrown off all the shackles of religion, as unworthy of a citizen patriot and a free born philosopher. “Ye're prophane, man,” replied Andrew, “nac guid can come o' ye, unless ye mend; but for that, I doubt Tam Paine, an' the devil, Gude forgie me for naming them, hae been owre busy wi' ye.” Several of the company laughed at Andrew's seriouness and alarm; and the more to intimidate him, as he left the house, Steele called after him, “Ye maun rin fast, Andy, when ye pass the Saut-Hole, or some ghaist will catch you there. Ye ken its the devil's haunt.” Andrew was on foot. He blessed himself and walked onwards, endeavouring to divert his fears by occasionally whistling Patrick's Day, or humming one of the songs of Paddy's Resource. But still the terrors of the times and the awfulness of the place he was approaching, could not be driven from his recollection. “There will be unco doings, I'll warrant,” thought he. “Oh! gin yin kend wha would be slain, an' wha would be spared, in the struggle, it would be a satisfaction. Gin we had but a guid prophet noo, like Jeremiah, to tell us the warst!—But Gude bless us, there's the Saut-Hole! an' the trees growin' in it, an' roon' it, whare, they say, Sir Geoffrey ravished the bonnie lass that was found dead there sax years syne. It might na' be true, for it was a lie-like story. But preserve us! what's that amang the trees! Our father!—our father!— Ah! I canna pray. It is the White Woman hersel', that haunts here. I'm gane! I'm gane!” He staggered some paces back, with his eyes fixed on the apparition; and then stood stock-still, unable either to speak or to move. The vision seemed to rise from the haunted hole, and advance slowly from among the trees towards him. It every now and then uttered a deep sigh, and a hollow groan. Its form was that of a handsome woman, clothed in a winding sheet of the purest white. Her jaws were tied with a fillet, and her countenance had the pale inanimate look of a corpse. Andrew's hair now stiffened, and stood upright on his head; his teeth chattered, his knees bent under him, and his arms fell flat and useless by his sides; while his whole frame shook convulsively as the awful figure drew near and passed him. “It will surely leave me,” thought he. But it returned, and repassed him several times in the same manner. At length it stood right before him, and gave a fearful mean. “It wants me to speak,” thought he. Twice he tried, but tried in vain. The third time he was more successful. “In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are you flesh or spirit?” said he. “Thou hast invoked me by a name which compels me to answer,” replied the vision. “I am the ghost of Elizabeth Robbins, whom the wicked master of these domains unfortunately met and forced to his loathed embraces, in yonder hollow. There was the scene of my death. I was resolved not to survive the loss of my purity, and with this knife (said she, holding up the appearance of one in her bloody hand,) as soon as the savage left me, I pierced myself to the heart. Unfit for Heaven, and yet not doomed to hell, I am permitted to wander on the earth, and am directed to show the evils that are coming on the country, to the first mortal that should invoke me by the great and mysterious name you have pronounced.” She here paused a moment, but soon resumed— “Well may the swain shudder, and the maiden mourn, for wickedness has overspread the land, and its punishment shall fall heavily on the people. Ah! I see the noblest in the country die on the field, and the bravest hang on the gibbet! Neighbours raise the steel of animosity and death against each other; friends are now each others murderers—brother rushes against brother, and father and son bury the weapon of destruction in each others bosoms! Mourn, ye virgins! your fathers are captives, your brothers are slain, and your lovers are scourged, and hanged, and quartered! And ye too, ye wives, and ye widows, as well as maidens, lament; for while your purity is ravished by beastly force, the heads of those who would have defended or avenged you, are withering on high in the public places.—Ah! there are now numerous and fair villages in the land, of which, yon moon, ere she twice attains her zenith of full grandeur in the heavens, shall see only the smoking ruins! She will see our hills, and our plains, and our streets, and our high-ways red with the blood of men! She will behold the withering features of the dead, and the writhing agonies of the dying!—Hark! I hear the groans of thousands in their last struggles with the pangs of death! Weep ye widows, and ye orphans!—ah! ye fill the land! Weep, for thyself, Andrew Ramsay! for thou shalt see misery: Go thy way now, and tremble, and tell the multitude to tremble also, for they would not repent!” With an awful shriek, she flew over the tops of the trees, and disappeared like a cloud expanding along the distant verge of the horizon. Andrew continued for some minutes, gazing, breathless and stupified, after her. The cold sweat fell in large drops from his brows, which on the return of his faculties, he mistook for blood; and he supposed himself undone. By degrees the spasm of his muscles relaxed, and voluntary motion being thus restored, he flew on the wings of terror to the nearest habitation. The family were in bed. “Ah! Brice Lee! Brice Lee!” cried he, “for the love of Heaven, let in a miserable frien' that is frightened to death.” The door was soon opened, but the unfortunate Andrew had fainted on the threshold. By the attention of the family, he was soon restored to sensation, and, at different intervals, gave them the foregoing account. In the morning, intelligence of his situation was sent to his friends, and he was carried home during the course of the day. When Ellen and her friend visited him in the evening, as before stated, he was in the delirium of a high fever. They were both shocked at the recital of the story, and endeavoured to give the family what consolation they could. Ellen expressed her opinion that they had no cause to anticipate any particular calamity, on account of the prediction that had been given. “For,” she observed, “even supposing the apparition to have been supernatural, and commissioned by Heaven to reveal the secrets of futurity, it had not foretold that Andrew should feel misery; it only said that he should see it. But even putting the worst construction on the prophecy, it might be considered as fulfilled in his present sufferings; and that whenever he should recover from the effects of his fright, all would, no doubt, be well again with the family.” Her attempts at consolation were, however, in vain; and she left the house with a sorrowful heart, at having witnessed such an example of the deplorable effects of superstition on the human mind. X 2 “Do you not believe this story of the ghost?” asked Miss Agnew, as they walked-homeward. “No,” replied Ellen. “And how do you account for this man's illness?” was again asked. “Without having recourse to any thing supernatural in the case,” she replied, “I can account for it in two ways, either of which, to me, would be satisfactory. But, surely, Maria, you do not believe that this man really saw a spirit.” “I confess,” replied Maria, “from every thing I see and hear I cannot get over such a belief. I cannot, on any other supposition, account for this man's illness. But let me hear how you account for it?” “My first method of doing so,” said Ellen,” is this, I can easily conceive that the intimidated and intoxicated imagination of this poor man, after what had passed in the Shabeen house, was sufficient to conjure up at the dubious hour of darkness, all the frightful appearances which he describes as having beheld; and that such an appearance thus conjured up, might have occasioned all the disordered ideas to pass through his mind, relative to a subject which had just occupied it so intensely, that he ascribes to the revelation of the vision. This is my first method. My second is still an easier, more simple, and, under all the circumstances of the present case, perhaps a more satisfactory way of accounting for it. It is only by supposing it altogether a trick of Steele, or some other of his party. If you are acquainted with this person, and are really very anxious to be satisfied on the subject, I will pledge my reputation for sagacity, that by managing him properly, you will be able to obtain as satisfactory an explanation of the matter as you can desire.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XXI. And is it come to this at last? And is thy lot, fair maiden cast, That thou must foul pollution bear, And sink and die in deep despair? Shall villains, in their guilt, succeed To make an angel's bosom bleed? May Heaven avert the dreadful day, For Heaven is stronger still than they. Thaunus the-Druid. On hearing the latter mode by which Ellen accounted for the vision of Andrew Ramsay, Miss Agnew acknowledged its plausibility. “I did not think of that,” said she; “but I believe it may have been the case; for I have often heard of such tricks being practised on weak minded people, by mischievous wags. I shall make my brother question Steele on the subject.” “But, my dear Maria,” observed Ellen, “there is a piece of intelligence connected with this story, which excites horrible ideas in my mind. Tell me, did you ever before hear that Sir Geoffrey was blamed with the death of that unfortunate girl?” “I have heard it whispered,” returned Maria; “but there being no proof of it, every one was afraid, at the time of the shocking event, to mention it publicly; and I had supposed that the suspicion itself had dropped from the minds of the people.” “It is a dreadful tale, Maria. I remember the report of her death; and have often wondered that it's perpetrator has never been discovered.” “I believe,” said Maria, “that there were no other grounds for suspecting Sir Geoffrey, than that he had, for sometime previous, paid unusual attention to the young woman, who is said to have been remarkably handsome, and that immediately after the occurrence, he withdrew from the country, and ever since continued, until the beginning of last winter, to reside abroad. But these grounds, you know, were not sufficient to warrant magisterial interference, especially with a person of his great wealth and consequence in society.” “Thank heaven! I have escaped uniting myself to such a man,” ejaculated Ellen. At that moment, a man in a gig approached them at full gallop, followed by another on horseback. The ladies stood still to let the travellers pass; but the former stopped the gig suddenly on coming towards them. “Fortune favours us!” cried he. “Let us seize her at once, and be off!” So saying he sprang out; and with the assistance of the horseman, hastily secured Ellen in the gig, when gagging her with a large handkerchief, he turned his horse, and drove away at full speed. Miss Agnew in a state of terror and distraction, fled and screamed for assistance; but before she could make herself properly understood by those who flocked to her aid, her friend was far off. Sir Geoffrey was suspected for this outrage; and a pursuit commenced in the direction of his residence; but without success. The ruffians had taken an unfrequented road which led them directly to the untenanted house on his estate before mentioned. The villain in the gig did not speak a word to his captive, either by way of threat or conciliation, until they arrived there. “You are safe now, madam,” was his first observation; “and, thank heaven, we are safe too.” A light was soon struck, and a fire kindled, when Ellen, for the first time, recognised the two men to be the very, same that had before attempted to seize her. “I am at length undone!” cried she, the gag being now taken out of her mouth. “For God's sake, have mercy on me! Deliver me to my grandfather, and you shall be rewarded to your utmost desire.” “We know better, ma'am,” replied one of the fellows. “We shall be better rewarded by keeping you. You may as well be quiet. Here nobody can hear your noise, and come to your rescue, as that damned rascal in green did the other week. My master will use you like the apple of his eye; for he is over head and ears in love with you; and you may live like a queen, if you only take care to please him. To be sure he's a little stingy with his purse; but, I think, if you manage him well, that you may make your own of him.” To these remarks Ellen considered it useless to reply. She laid her head on a table that was near her, and relieved her bursting heart with a flood of tears, that fortunately came to her relief. On looking up after some time, she perceived that one of the men had left her; but the other sat between her and the door, and coldly remarked that, as she must be fatigued, she was perhaps disposed to go to bed. “There is a bed in this closet,” said he, as he opened a door that led into a small apartment. “It is a comfortable one, and expressly prepared in expectation of your using if.” She meditated for some time in silence. At length, under the impression that she would be freed from the observation of her jailor, she thought proper to retire. “Wont you have a light? ma'am,” asked the man. “No,” said she, and she closed the door of her apartment without waiting for more questions. She threw herself on her knees, and addressed her supplications to that God who had more than once vouchsafed her deliverance from similar distresses. “I throw myself again into thy presence,” said she, “and thou art as mighty to save as ever. Add to those gracious favours thou hast already bestowed upon me, one more instance of thy goodness; save me once more from the power of this man, who has so long hunted after my ruin. Shouldst thou deny me the means of escape, Oh! enlighten the mind of my persecutor to see the enormity of the crime he would commit: awaken his conscience, inspire him with repentance for his past offences, and restrain him from becoming guilty of additional injury to a helpless maiden. But shouldst thou in thy providence think fit to inflict upon me still severer trials than I have yet sustained, Oh! at least, preserve me from pollution and infamy, for into thy gracious keeping I commit all my safety.” In a somewhat calmer state of mind, she threw herself on the bed, and with a trembling frame and agitated heart, passed a sleepless night. The morning only brought an increase of her sorrow, for it brought the detestable Sir Geoffrey himself. “Sweetest of thy sex,” said he, “behold in this reluctantly adopted and disagreeable measure, the violence of my passion. I cannot live without you. Be mine; make me happy as your husband; accept of me on any conditions you may prescribe. My fortune, my life—all are yours, only give me yourself in exchange.” “Son of iniquity; barbarous, wicked man, I know you now too well ever to link my fate with yours. Had I known you sooner, you should never have received even the reluctant civilities that were once extorted from me.” “My wish must be gratified!” he exclaimed. “Either voluntarily make me happy, or know, that force will compel you. I will give you till this evening to decide.” “Infamous man! do you insult me, by calculating on my deliberate acquiescence in guilt? for guilt it would be, knowing you as I now do, to accept your proposals. I am aware that you have a villanous conscience, capable enough of perpetraling your threats; but think you that there is not a God who can blast you ere your crimes be accomplished!” “Sorceress!” cried he, “you hate me, and defy me; but your beauty has enchanted my senses. I am mad with love! I will not postpone my bliss. The delay I proposed was unwise. Accident might once more rob me of my treasure; but now, bewitching, lovely girl, you shall bless me in spite of accident!” So saying, he clasped her in his arms with a force and vehemence that made her tremble, and she screamed hopelessly but instinctively for help. “It is in vain for you to resist,” said he, loosening her for a moment. “My mind is too fiercely bent on you, to leave you without being satisfied. Your strength is useless, for if aid be necessary to force you, I have it at hand. As to screams, in this remote place, thank my stars, they will meet no ear but such as will listen to me alone.” He again attempted to seize her; but with a desperate effort she sprang from him. “O God,” she exclaimed, “if man cannot hear me, thou canst! Save me! Save me from the murderer of Robbins.” “What meanest thou by that name?” said he, for a moment struck almost motionless by the sound. “To awaken thy guilty conscience,” she replied, “and prevent thee from being twice a murderer.” “Girl, 'tis false,” he cried, in great agitation. “Thou art a fiend; but thou art a beautiful one, and thy charms shall now recompense me for this pang.” In saying this, with the fury of a tyger, he darted upon her, and threw her on the bed. At that moment a confusion of voices were heard out side of the house, and instantaneously, the shock of a door bursting from its bolts, which was immediately followed by the discharge of a pistol in the outer room. “Ah! villain is it you! Receive this! Where is the lady!” was exclaimed by a voice familiar to Ellen. “She maun be in that room, gin she's on earth,” was replied by a coarse female voice, and the next moment the door was laid on the floor with a dreadful crash; and the Green Minstrel appeared. “Horrible monster!” cried he, seizing Sir Geoffrey by the throat, “have you ruined that angel?” “Mercy! murder! I have not injured her,” stammered the terrified and half strangled knight. “It is well for you. This hour would else have been your last,” replied the Minstrel, and he dashed him to the floor with a force that made the house shake. Then turning to Ellen, “sweet maid, are you safe?” he inquired. “Thank Heaven, I am. My deliverer again! How providential was this?” she replied. “Thank Heaven! indeed,” said he, and he pressed her hand to his lips. At that instant she screamed, and casting her arms about him, with a sudden effort, moved him from his position, and received the point of a dirk in her neck. It would have entered deep enough to have terminated both her sorrows and her life, had not the timely interference of Peg Dornan arrested the blow. “The curse o' God on ye for a murderer!” exclaimed Peg, “you thoucht to kill the bonniest lad, an' ye hae killed the bonniest lass in the land.” The Minstrel turned round, and beheld the dirk in Sir Geoffrey's hand, with Peg Dornan struggling to force it from him. He also perceived it stained with the blood of his beloved. “Infernal fiend!” cried he, wresting the weapon from him; and again dashing him to the floor, he held him firmly there with his foot fixed on his neck. Jemmy Hunter at that moment entered. He had been employed in binding the legs and arms of Tim Rogers, Sir Geoffrey's servant, whom the Minstrel had knocked down in the outer chamber, on the firing of the pistol. Hunter performed the operation with great coolness and dexterity, remarking, “I wish, frien', I was tying this rape aboot your neck, to gie you the weicht o' your damned carcass at its end.” Ellen had swooned; and while Peg was running for some water to sprinkle on her face, the Minstrel who believed her to be really dead, leaned over her with tears gushing from his eyes. “Purest, loveliest of created beings,” cried he, “thou art gone to a world more worthy of thee. Thou hast left thy lover. But, O! thou wert snatched from him too soon. Thou wert the delight of mine eyes, the hope, the joy of my heart— this widowed heart, that shall now never more know peace.—Unmanly monster!” he exclaimed, turning towards Sir Geoffrey; “couldst thou not have aimed better, and slain me as was thy design; and not have destroyed such innocence, such virtue, such loveliness!—but thy barbarous hand has left to me a living, lingering death. Ah! yet take the weapon, if thou hast any mercy in thee, and end my sorrows.” “Dinna lay in sae much to heart,” said Hunter. “You should na vex yoursel' sae. It's no' reasonable Y to greet like a woman, (the tears at the same time swelling in his own eyes,) though it's a sair an' sorrowfu' sight—for she was a weel-fared, guid young lady. But ye maunna talk o' deeing. Ye maun leeve to bring this wicked limb o' hell to the hemp rape for this wark.” Peg Dornan had now returned, and was bathing Ellen's temples and cheeks with some spirits which she had found in the outer room, when she opened her eyes and began again to respire. The Minstrel, who had watched her with the anxiety of despair, gave a shout of joy. “My love!” said he, “speak to me. Do not you know your Edward, your Middleton, your Barrymore, your Minstrel? Live, my love, and never will I leave thy side till this execrable wretch be secured beyond the power of injuring you more.” She held out her hand to him. “I am happy,” said she, “to see you living. Ah! I thought the steel had entered your body. But heaven has been more merciful. You are indeed my Edward, my Minstrel, my preserver. None else can ever be my love.” Edward kissed her hand fervently. Now indeed, he felt happiness. What a contrast! He who had the moment before been sunk into the lowest depths of misery, would not now have exchanged feelings with the proudest monarch in christendom. The agitation of our lovers soon began to subside. Ellen's wound was dressed. It was found to penetrate very little deeper than the skin, for the timely interference of Peg Dornan, had given such an oblique direction to the stroke, that it had inflicted only a superficial injury, which threatened no ill consequences. Her swoon had been occasioned solely from the supposition that Edward was murdered. Peg Dornan had by this time discovered some wine and other articles of refreshment in the house, of which Ellen partook, and in a short time her strength was sufficiently restored to admit of her being removed. Edward had been slightly wounded in the thigh by the contents of the pistol, which Berwick had fired at him on entering the house, having grazed along the flesh, and torn part of it away. During the hurry and excitement of the preceding scene, he had paid no attention to the wound. He now, however, found it necessary to have it dressed, which was soon accomplished, and he was prepared to escort Ellen to her grandfather's, where she wished to be taken. They were now under some embarrassment how to dispose of their prisoners. Hunter would have carried them to a magistrate for the purpose of having them committed to jail. But Sir Geoffrey threatened that if they did so, he would bring immediate destruction on O'Halloran, by disclosing his treasonable practices to the government; and Edward considering that he had not actually accomplished any crime for which he could be capitally punished, thought it better not to take this course. At the same time, he conceived it unsafe to permit him to remain at large, for then would not only O'Halloran be in danger from his disclosures, but Ellen might again suffer from his violence. While they were in this perplexity, the Recluse and M`Nelvin arrived. They had heard of Ellen's seizure, and suspecting Sir Geoffrey to be its author, had hastened to Carebrow-hall. M`Nelvin alone entered the house, and discovered from one of the servants where Sir Geoffrey had gone that morning. “I wonder what the devil he is going to do there?” observed the servant, “for it's a waste farm.” M`Nelvin made no answer; but joining the Recluse, they hastened as fast as possible to the place, and arrived just at the point of time we have mentioned. They were of opinion, that it would be proper to effect the removal of the captives without delay, lest some of Sir Geoffrey's domestics might arrive, and occasion them trouble, nay, perhaps, effect his rescue. It was therefore determined to deliver him, and his fellow culprit, into the hands of O'Halloran, to be dealt with as the leaders of the United Irishmen should think proper. They now proceeded by a private road to Mr. Agnew's, from whence, as soon as night came, their prisoners could be conveyed without risk or difficulty to their destination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XXII. With many a vow and lock'd embrace, Our parting was fu' tender; And pledging oft to meet again, We tore ourselves asunder. Burns. As the party proceeded to Mr. Agnew's, the lovers found an opportunity to ride at some distance from the rest of the company and enjoy the luxury of a private conversation. Ellen expressed some inquietude, lest Edward should, even under the disguise of a minstrel, be recognized by the United Irishmen, and involved into fresh troubles. “I keep so close,” said he, “that except when the necessity of serving you requires it, I never leave my concealment, and, on such occasions, this habit has hitherto been an effectual disguise; and you will acknowledge that my general hiding-place is well chosen, both in point of security and enjoyment, when I inform you that it is the Recluse's cavern.” “That cavern is, indeed, an endeared spot to me,” said she, and she coloured as she spoke; “since it is the asylum of my two best and dearest friends.” “Ah! my heart's best treasure, sweet endearing girl!” exclaimed Edward, “how happy you make me in accounting me one of that sacred number!” “Permit me,” said she, wishing to stop his raptures, and to give a different direction to the conversation, “permit me to inquire how you discovered me this morning, in so obscure and unsuspicious a place; and also how you appeared so fortunately to rescue me on a former occasion?” Y 2 “My love,” said he, “I shall explain the whole mystery. You know that after my escape from the United Irishmen, I kept up a constant correspondence with the Recluse, by whom I was informed of every thing that happened to you. When he mentioned the persecution you suffered from the addresses of Sir Geoffrey, and that your grandfather exerted his authority over you in his favour, I anticipated some misfortune, and resolved to visit your neighbourhood, to watch over your safety, and rescue you from any calamity that might befall you. To effect this, it was necessary, for obvious reasons, to disguise myself. After my return home, I had employed one of Arthur O'Neil's pupils, to give me instructions on the harp; for I had imbibed your taste for that instrument; and having become a tolerable performer, I adopted the habit and profession of a minstrel. I arrived at the Recluse's cavern in the beginning of March; and by M`Nelvin's management I was admitted to perform as a harper in the castle, at the celebration of St. Patrick's Day, on which occasion you so signalized me, by bestowing on me the contested prize, as to excite the envy of my competitors. “The jealousy of Sir Geoffrey, on that occasion, I made no doubt, was the cause of his urging you so instantaneously to accept his proposals; and I determined, at all risks, to rescue you from his power. But when I heard that you had consented to become his wife, I thought it improper to interfere, and I became almost distracted with intensity of grief; and, I assure you, that had you then married him, I should have fled my country never to see it more. “It was then that the Recluse, in pity to my sufferings, revealed to me his relationship to you, and the other particulars of his life; and gave me assurances that, as he knew your consent had proceeded from a deference to parental authority, he would interfere with an authority of that description, which you would esteem more imperative than that of your grandfather. The happy consequence of his interference, I shall never forget. He ran some risk on the occasion; but his affection for you, and his knowledge of Sir Geoffrey's character, constrained him to overlook all hazards. “Aware that your tormentor would adopt other methods of possessing you, I determined to keep a close watch on his motions. For this purpose, I had recourse to Peg Dornan, whose profession as a beggar would procure her constant and unsuspected admission to his house. Of her zeal in your cause, I was aware, and of her prudence in such matters, I had before ample demonstration. She readily undertook the office assigned her, and has discharged it with fidelity and success. “It was she who informed me that Berwick and Rodgers, had engaged to be the instruments of Sir Geoffrey's villany. I observed them several times suspiciously lurking in your neighbourhood, as if watching an opportunity to seize you. In all your walks and journeys, I, therefore, determined to hover near you, that in case of any attack, I might be at hand for your defence. “Accordingly, when you set off for Mr. Agnew's, I followed you. It was fortunate I did so.—But you know the result. Before Berwick recovered from the effects of the blow, you had resumed your journey, in safety from his pursuit. He did not, however, attempt to pursue; for I watched until he had re-mounted, and set off in a different direction. “Since your visit to Mr. Agnew's, that I might be convenient to you, I have resided about half a mile distant, at the house of an old widow, a strenuous friend to the United Irishmen, who has carefully and kindly concealed me, under the persuasion that I am proscribed by the government, and hiding from its power. “Conceiving, that if Sir Geoffrey renewed his attempt to seize you, he would do it in a more formidable manner than before, I thought it prudent to provide an assistant, in whose courage and fidelity I could depend. You will readily agree, that I could not have found one better qualified in these respects, than our honest farmer, James Hunter. He engaged ardently in the affair, and without hesitation took lodging beneath the same roof with me, under a similar plea. Peg Dornan, who, of course, knew where to find us, came to us this morning breathless, and in great agitation. “Come oot,” said she, “till I tell you!” I accompanied her out of doors. “They hae ta'en her, at last,” she resumed, “I ca'ed at Mr. Agnew's before I cam' here, an' the servants are pursuing, yin, yin way, an' yin anither; but nane o' them the richt way; I ken that. Miss Agnew has had a'e fit o' the mither after anither, till she's amaist dead. Ye maun ken that I was sleeping in Sir Geoffrey's kitchen-neuk when Rodgers cam' hame in the night time. The master met him in the hall, for, I trow, he had no' been in bed; an' neither o' them saw me, though I was within twa yards o' them. “Have you got her to Gorman's house?” said the master. “We have, your honour; and a right speedy scamper we had of it,” said Rodgers, “she made such a screaming; but Berwick soon gagged her. But her comrade, Agnew's daughter, ran and terrified the neighbours so much, that, late as it was, I feared we would have been catched, before we got to Gorman's. But the horses were guid, your honour; and she is now as snug for you, as if she were lodged in your own bed room.” “I immediately summoned Hunter. Our horses were soon prepared, for we kept them in an adjoining field, ready for any emergency. As Peg alone knew Gorman's place, it was necessary to take her along as a guide. She was accordingly mounted behind Hunter; and we set off at full speed. Thank Providence, our haste was not in vain. You are safe once more; and I trust your friends, in whose hands your infamous persecutor now is, will take care that he shall not again have the power to injure you.” When he had ended his recital, “Ah! generous Barrymore,” she exclaimed, “what do I not owe you for so much kindness?” “You owe me nothing,” he replied. “Ah! yes;” he continued, “I do ask for the vastness of my love, not for my services, the most valued, the most precious reward this world can afford me; I ask thyself?” The burning blush that now glowed on the countenance of Ellen was beautiful beyond the power of genius to portray. It was like the living saffron that irradiates the face of heaven, when the sun gilds with his golden beams, the bosom of a snowy cloud; and the look of gladness that sparkled in her bright rolling eyes, was like the agitated reflection of the same luminary when it glitters from a liquid mirror. She replied not. Their arrival at Mr. Agnew's prevented her; but to the penetrating eye of Edward, her look had spoken a reply a thousand times more satisfactory than could have been conveyed in the strongest language. For reasons well known to his friends, Edward now disappeared. He returned to his hospitable widow, and conferring on her an unexpected reward, told her that he must, with his companion, seek a new residence for a few weeks. When night came he assisted his friends to convey the culprits to O'Halloran Castle, and then retired with the Recluse to his subterraneous dwelling. Sir Geoffrey, and his worthy compeer, the game-keeper, were soon secured in the conspirator's strong hold, within the Point rock; but met with very different treatment from what Edward had received, when confined in the same place the preceding year. The chiefs of the conspiracy, besides their displeasure at his conduct to Ellen, detested him as an apostate, one whose fraudulent behaviour towards them had thrown their affairs into considerable embarrassment, and whose fears alone had prevented him from absolutely betraying them to their enemies. They, therefore, on first receiving him, secured him in a dark apartment, chained to the rock, where he had only straw for a bed, and was fed on bread and water. His servant was treated more leniently, as being only an instrument in the hands of the superior criminal. At length Sir Geoffrey consented to purchase greater indulgence, by giving O'Halloran an order on his Dublin banker, for the twenty thousand pounds of which he had attempted to defraud him. Edward having thus secured the object of his affections from the further aggressions of her tormentor, thought of returning to Dublin. As he had lately held no conversation with any of the conspirators on political subjects, he neither knew, nor wished to know, the posture of their affairs. The safety and welfare of Ellen was the great object that had occupied his mind. He was however far from viewing the threatening aspect of the times with indifference; but he did not conceive the stability of the constitution to be really in danger from the present conspiracy. Had he thought so, its preservation would undoubtedly have enlisted all his energy and feelings, and been viewed as possessing a paramount claim over every other consideration, to his services. The threatened insurrection, if it did take place, as its materials were so very discordant and scattered, and the great majority of the influential men of the kingdom, its opponents, he believed, would be neither very extensive nor of long duration. It might bring destruction on a few of its leaders and their most zealous followers; but he had no power to prevent this; he could only deplore it. In the event of an actual rebellion, the preservation of O'Halloran would be the chief object of his solicitude. He believed, however, that by ingratiating himself with the executive authorities of the day, he might acquire sufficient influence to protect this enthusiastic old man, should he fall into the hands of the government. Hence he thought it necessary to return to the capital; which he did with the less reluctance, as he knew that he left Ellen under the protection of the watchful eye of her father, the affectionate sagacity of M`Nelvin, and the energetic and faithful arm of Jemmy Hunter. Of every important occurrence, he also knew that he should receive the earliest intelligence, and could act accordingly. During the parting interview he had with Ellen in her father's cave and presence, while under the influence of the warm feelings the occasion excited, he solicited strongly for an immediate marriage. “I am at my own disposal,” said he, “independent as far as a competence of worldly wealth can make me so, in my own right; so that, without reference to either the pleasure or the displeasure of my father or my uncle, I think I may be justified in taking this step.” Ellen declared that in the present critical state of her grandfather's affairs, she could not consent to such a measure without his approbation, “and you are aware,” said she, “that to obtain that, the obstacles are insurmountable.” Her father also declared that he would not consent to a private union, which, however, fair and valid, would carry with it something of a clandestine and improper air, and which might, from that very circumstance alone, be displeasing to Edward's relations. “No,” said he, “my young, but too ardent friend, let the crisis of the times be past, let the fate of this conspiracy be decided, and when the storm which it raises is blown over, and the affairs of our country again become calm and settled, I shall promote your views of domestic felicity; and publicly, perhaps, (for Providence may by that time restore me to society) have the pleasure, with the approbation of your friends, of bestowing my daughter on you, and giving you both, at the moment of the ceremony, a father's benediction.” Edward acquiesced, having first obtained from Ellen an assurance that she would comply with his wishes, whenever such a period as that to which her father alluded, should arrive. “But, ah! surely,” said she, “this is not a time to indulge our selfish wishes; this is no time for the mirth, or joy, or pageantry of a marriage, when our country is in sorrow, when she is about to be agonized at every pore; and, perhaps, rent in pieces by a dreadful convulsion. Ah! my Edward, I fear we have numerous scenes of sorrow to witness, perhaps to endure, before we can experience joy. Let us prepare our minds for the worst; but amidst our misfortunes, whatever they may be, let us be faithful to each other; for be assured, that whether in prosperity or adversity, I shall be faithful to you.” “My only love!” replied Edward, touched to the heart by her fervency, “that God who loves purity, will avert from thee the calamities thy toe timid mind forebodes; and as to the fidelity of my heart's affections, the moment of its first wandering from thee, shall be that of its last pulsation. No; Ellen, I have rivetted thy image, I have rivetted thy virtues and thy loveliness, too strongly here, in my heart, ever to displace them, and they never shall be displaced.” He warmly caught her hand, and kissed it. “God preserve thee, my espoused,” he exclaimed, “for whatever man may say or do, thou art mine in the ordination of Heaven. God preserve thee, until I see thee again!” and he rushed from her in violent agitation, and departed. END OF VOLUME 1.</field>
