      <field name="fulltext">PART I. Virtue belongeth nor to rank nor name— As sacred in cottage held as in the hall' There was a rude but pleasant farm-house situated on the green banks of one of the pleasant inlets that go meandering from the Sound far into the verdant bosom of West-chester County. It was one story high, with a broad, steep, moss-covered roof, over which an old oak spreads its wide branches, shielding it the whole day from the summer sun. An old `stoope' protected the door, and its rude columns were thickly clad with the entwiaing honey-suckle. Each end of the old black farm-house was also nearly covered, save where openings had been cut for the windows, with woodbine and other creeping plants. There was a neat vegetable garden at one end of the dwelling and a small orchard at the other, with the thatched roof of a long, low barn, seen in the distance. Before the door was a sort of lawn, on which the sheep, geese, turkies, and an old domestic cow, fed all day. This lawn was between the house and the pleasant creek, where stood a gate sheltered by a sycamore tree, through which the cattle were driven to water. All around was a scene of pleasant vale and wood-land, with elms and oaks bending low over the clear deep stream. On the opposite side were seen several farm-houses with shady walks along the banks between them, and a little ways below, on an eminence, was visible the white columns of a handsome country-seat, the summer residence of a wealthy New York merchant, who spent his winters only in the city, which was twenty miles distant. The inmates of the old farm-house whose humble exterior we have described, consisted of Mr. David Woodhull, a plain farmer, his wife, and their three daughters, of the respec tive ages of seventeen, twenty, and twenty-four. David was a hard working man, and with great industry just managed, as he said, `to make both ends meet at the year's end.' He was very good natured, and being always too tired when he came in at night to dispute any points with his good wife, she in ensibly got to have sole authority in his household. When David had been married twenty-five years he found that he was a cypher in his own family. Mrs. Woodhull managed every thing as if she were in reality a widow. David only did the farm's work—a sort of wage-less slave, whom Mrs. Woodhull allowed lodging and food for his support. Such undisputed power lodged in the hands of a wife soon exercised its peculiar influence over her habits and temper. From a pretty, pleasant young country bride, as she was when David first took her to wife, she gradually, with the possession of power, became imperative and absolute. Contradiction from David or from the three dear pledges of their `mutual love,' she could not endure with patience. By-and-by Mrs. Woodhull grew old and plain and this affected her temper. She was now cross from morning 'till night, and poor David found no peace save in the field or barn. At the time of our story the character of the lady was established through the whole country as a shrew of the first water. `Poor David Woodhull—don't he lead a life of it!' were the ejaculatory expressions of sympathy he received when the subject was spoken of by his sympathizing neighbors. If David, the rightful lord and master, `led such a life of it,' what kind of a life led the three daughters over whom the mother had a legitimate right to rule! And Mrs. Woodhull did not shrink from availing herself of this right. She ruled her children with a rod of iron. Never were poor girls kept under such strict severity. They were waked each morning, winter and summer, with the dawn by her scolding uproar, and all day long worked beneath her eye to the music of her tongue. The eldest daughter, Euphrosia, was twenty-four and unmarried. It is true nature had not bestowed on her thin person many of those charms that attract the other sex. Her hair was not red but sorrel colored; her face not dimpled but freckled; her eyes a greyish blue with pink edges; her neck skinny and her bust flat and bony; her waist, to be sure, was very, very small, not one inch larger round than her neck; her hands would have been admired doubtless in a collection of anatomical specimens, and her feet were excellent matches for her hands. Her nose was turned up and the corners of her mouth down. She spoke always to beaux with a simper and a pucker and a general sympathizing movement of her whole body. She thought herself very beautiful—for fat people were her aversion, it was so vulgar to be fat! Of course thin people were her delight, and she delighted in herself particularly. One quality she had however, respecting which all who knew Miss Euphrosia had but one opinion. This was her temper. It was her mother's double-distilled—the concentrated essence, as the quack's advertisements have it when they would forcibly express the strength of their nostrums. If Mrs. Woodhull was cross, Euphrosia was crosser. She did not, however, begin to manifest her peculiar disposition, (save, us will be seen, to her youngest sister,) 'till she found that she was waning an unwedded maid. Sally, the second daughter, was, in her elder sister's opinion, very homely, inasmuch as she was very fat. In person she was the very antipode of Miss Euphrosia. She was a short, thick, fleshy, good-natured creature, whom her mother's scolding or her sister's malice could never put out of temper. She had her fathers disposition, and like him received a shower of both their ill will. Though not handsome, Sally was very good-looking with her black hair, red round cheeks, and pleasant smile, which displayed fine white teeth. But her bare arms were brown and brawny, and her foot was like that of an ox. Biddy or Bridget the third daughter, was as unlike either of her two sisters as a ripe, luscious peach is like a squash or a red pepper. She was just seventeen and a perfect rustic beauty. Her hair was a dark brown, and curled beautifully all about her brows and adown her rounded neck. Her eyes were black and piercing, in the depths of which love unfledged, lay covert. Her lips were pliant coral, richly contrasting the beautiful setting of her pearly teeth which were displayed by the brightest and most beaming smile in the world a smile that emanated from a glad pure heart and bold brow—and bright was the sun of the soul within to shine forth so radiantly upon the face. She was just seventeen, and all the charms of womanhood were ripening in her person—the eloquent eye, the modest walk, the subdued smile, with the sweetly full bust, and rounded waist, and symmetrical foot, all betrayed that the spring of womanhood was just deepening into the warm and glowing summer. There was also a quiet dignity and a firmness of manner in her, rarely found with one so young and naturally and wholly ignorant of the world. She was a girl of good sense, but of a high spirit. From the time her personal charms had attracted the notice of the farmer's lads around and at church and gathering drew on her eyes of all the rustic beaux, which was about a year before our story commenced, she had brought upon herself the envious ill-will of her eldest sister, who from that moment became her persevering tormentor, annoying her in a thousand ways and making life itself miserable to her. Biddy had penetration enough to know the cause, and bore her ill-humor and overbearing tyranny with extraordinary patience, illustrating twenty times a day the truth of the beautiful adage, `a soft answer turneth away wrath'—that is, in her case, by turning it aside from affecting her own temper and spirit She could have born this and also her mother's unnatural treatment which grew severer as Biddy grew handsomer, and which at las reached so far that she forbade her attending church or even leaving the house for several weeks previous to the time with which we have to do. But she had unfortunately chanced to make an enemy of her sister Sally, who charged her with having tempted her stout and honest sweetheart, John Burn, from his allegiance and making him fall in love with her instead. It is true that John's heart was one Sunday set on fire by the blaze of an accidental glance of Biddy's bright eyes, and from that day he could think of nothing and talk of nothing but Biddy, quite forgetting that such a person as Sally Woodhull was in existence. He finished his madness by sending Biddy a boquet composed of scarlet poppies, water-lilies, mari-gold and pea-blossoms. Sally discovered this act of treachery to her, and instead of visiting with her vengeance the culprit himself, she poured the fury of her fleshly indignation upon the unoffending Bridget. This was the first time Sally was ever known to show temper. But a sage philosopher very sensibly has asked, `what will not an aggrieved woman do, especially when injured in her devout affections?' Thus Biddy's domestic relations became far from agreeable. Euphrosia disliked her from envy, Sally from jealousy, and her mother because it was her cross nature to do so. It was, therefore, very unpleasant for her to remain in doors and be the foot-ball of their several humors. Every disagreeable duty was put upon her, and she could perform nothing that could please either of the three. `Here, you trollop,' cries the mother, in a shrill octave, `that cat's got into the cupboard and spilt the cream. If I catch you to let the cat get in there again I'll trounce you within an inch of your life, if you was a grown married woman, as you never shall be so long as I have any work for you to do at home.' `Come, you Biddy,' bawls Miss Euphrosia, in a cross, spiteful tone, `and wash up this water I've slopped, if your lady-like hands an't too fine to touch the floor-cloth. When you've done it go out and bring in some wood. Tramp, quick, minx!' `What are you looking out o' the windur there for,' cries Sally from the churn, seeing Biddy pause in carryin a bucket of water to glance at a boat rowing on the creek; `you needn't think it's that fool, John Burn, coming to bring you any more yaller and red flowers. I gave John a lesson that day, 'ill keep him in his senses a while I guess Yes, you may laugh, but I guess John Burn knows who's substantial pretty and who isn't, if he was beguiled one time from his true duty. Come along and take this churn and scour it out clean.' Thus passed the wearisome days of slavish toil to poor Bridget. She sighed and patiently endured her servitude. But she had a secret solace in her lot. It chanced, that one sultry afternoon in July, two months before the time of our tale, that David was in a hur ry to get his hay in, before a storm, which was swiftly rising from the south-west, should overtake it in the field. He sent to the house for Sally to come and help him. `Humph,' said Sally, tossing her head; `let Miss Bridget go; she'll may-be find some flowers in the field to send John Burn.' `Yes, let her go,' chimed in Miss Euphrosia; `and don't let her wear her sun hat—a little tanning won't do her delicate complexion any harm.' So Biddy was sent to the hay-field and bare-head, Euphrosia withholding her broad straw hat. But what more beautiful covering than her brown tresses could be desired? She, however, had some care for her complexion, and when she reached the field she playfully removed the straw hat from her father's head to her own, and tying his handkerchief about his brows, joined him in his labors. How beautiful she looked in her father's old torn straw. What a world of beauty, all unconsciously, it shaded. With what grace she handles that rake, and how pliant and buoyant the motions of her body as she turns over the masses of fragrant hay. Hark! she is singin a jocund, careless voice— `Every lassie has her laddie None, they say, have I, Yet a' the lads they smile on me, When coming thro' the rye.' The sun at length set, seen in a celestial sea of roseate light, for the shower had rolled southward, where the columns of rain were at a distance falling from the cloud to the earth, and sweeping with vast and majestic motion over the Sound. Biddy leaned on her rake and gazed on the setting sun with pleasing interest, for, to youth and intelligent beauty, like hers, is ever united pure, though uncultivated, taste. `Come, my girl,' said her father, `let us go homeward;' and taking his rakes and forks upon his shoulder, he proceeded in the direction of his house, without looking back to see if she followed. She did not follow, nor did she hear him call to her; for her attention had been a moment before drawn from the gorgeous clouded sunset, by the appearance of a boat upon the creek, which formed a graceful bend at the foot of the meadow, its dark limpid breast half hidden by the trees that lined its banks. She was standing beneath an old apple-tree that grew within a few paces of a wall and hedge that separated the meadow from the creek. The boat contained two young gentlemen, and from their costume and the appearance of the fishing tackle in the boat, with a goodly number of fish, they had been on a fishing excursion to the old bridge half a mile above. They had discovered her some minutes before she saw them, and had purposely checked their boat to gaze upon her as she gracefully leaned on her rake with her father's old straw thrown back from her brow and her fine eyes full of thought, dwelling upon the sunset sky. Biddy lingered a moment to gaze with surprise and curiosity, as all pretty maidens would do, on beholding the apparition of two handsome young men at such a time and place. The bold glances of one of them who wore an incipient mustache and was very fashionably and finically attired, recalled her to a sense of her impropriety of her delay, and at the same time to the fact of her father's old hat being on her head. Half laughing, half blushing at the appearance, she took off the hat, loosening in the act a cloud of glorious brown hair, and turned to make her escape after her father who had now got quite to the bars at the other end of the meadow. Before she had taken half a dozen steps she heard a footstep behind her, and the sound told her one of the young men had bounded over the wall. Alarmed, she nevertheldss did not increase her pace, and the next moment she felt a hand laid with slight force upon her wrist. She turned with some misgiving at her heart, though she felt no fear, and beheld beside her the young man with the mustache. `Sweet creatshure,' he said in that fashionable chewed tone, so much in vogue with certain people, `deue not fly me! Boye `Eaven! what rustic loveliness.' `Let me go, sir,' cried the young girl, struggling to disengage herself. `Go! incomparable rurality! exquisite rusticity! no, I will not let thee go.' `But I will go sir,' said Biddy with emphasis. `Nay, do not struggle, my pretty one, I must have a kiss first.' As he spoke he caught her in his arms and would have ravished a kiss from her bright indignant lips, if the other, who on seeing him leap ashore and followed him, had not at the instant came up. `What do you mean, Barton?' he cried in an indignant voice, at the same time releasing the maiden from his rude embrace. `Poh, Morris,' he answered with a laugh, `she's but a pretty tit-bit of a rural—I was doing her an honor, boye `Eaven, to kiss her.' `An honor I have no desire of receiving, I assure you at your lips, sir,' said Biddy with a smile of contempt, which she instantly changed to one of gratitude as she turned to the other and warmly thanked him for his interference. `I have done but my duty,' he answered, fixing his fine eyes upon her with undisguised yet respectfully subdued admiration. `I hope you will parkon my friend here, who I trust will not offend again.' `Offend! demme! you are very green, Morris,' said the other, as Biddy, after bowing slightly to Edward Morris and bestowing upon him a radiant smile and a glance that made his blood leap, tripped away with her old straw hat in one hand and her rake balanced over her shoulder; `she's but a farmer's daughter and unprotected.' And the sensual yet foppish Fitz Henry Barton stuck his glass in his eye and looked after her as she lightly crossed the meadow. Nor could Morris refrain from following her retreat with an admiring eye, as he contemplated her pretty round figure and graceful movements, into which she had insensibly, from the innate consciousness of being observed, thrown a spice of rustic coquetry. Coquetry of manner is instinctive in woman—even in the most natural and unsophisticated. `True, she is unprotected,' said Morris, as Biddy disappeared amid the trees of her father's orchard, `but helplessness is in itself a sacred shield to protect innocence. I am pained, Barton, at your licentious notions with regard to woman.' `It is not woman in general that I think lightly of,' said Barton arranging his cravat with an affected air, `but of girls of her class —pretty girls I mean. Do you suppose I would have gone up to a respectable young lady in this way, eh?' `I don't know what you mean by respectable,' said Morris, with some severity. `Why, respectable is—demme! is respectable, eh?' `Why, I will not affect to be ignorant of what your notions of respectable are! They are on a par with those who move in what is called `fashionable life.' But `respectable' is, in my idea, based on integrity, honesty, and virtue. This farmer, whoever he is that is the father of this young girl, is, if he possesses these qualities, as respectable as John Jacob A—' `Pah, Morris!' said Barton, fingering his mustache, `you're getting develish low of late in your ideas! Do you mean to say that I did as wrong in offering to kiss this pretty wench as if she had been—had been—had been for instance Miss — of Broadway?' `Yes, higher wrong—because in this instance the party was wholly unknown to you.' `But, still, you don't say I insulted her?' `I do.' `She certainly can't feel so sensitively on such a point, as a respectable girl would do! Being brought up in the country she cannot have that delicacy which is so easily wounded in cultivated females. `If anything their naturalness of character and retired mode of life render them more so than our city females. By heaven! Barton I could have struck you—she was so very modest and pretty.' `Ha, ha! devilish good! Edward Morris, the high descended and rich, doing battle for a hay-making wench! 'Pon honor, Ned, I must cut your acquaintance! ha, ha, hah!' Morris looked slightly displeased, and they crossed the hedge and entered their boat in silence. They floated with the current some distance, when Barton said, in a light manner— `By-the-by, Morris, I think I shall follow up this adventure! It is'nt every day a pretty thing like this jumps into a man's arms!' `I do believe, Barton,' said Morris, with quickness, `that you feel yourself at liberty to attempt the seduction of every unprotected girl.' `No, not if she is respectable! Oh! no! It is the pretty poor girls—the—farmer's daughters—the milliners—the poor widow's daughters—the—the—' `The poor, friendless and unprotected, in fine,' continued Morris, with a look of virtuous indignation; `those whom Providence, by denying them natural protectors, has tacitly and eloquently thrown upon the protection of the strong and able. If you were not my relative, Barton, I should despise you.' `Parbleu, Ned! you are too philanthropic! You have too high notions of the virtue of this class of girls. There is'nt one of them but would be glad to bestow their chary favors upon an elegant young fellow who has money and can buy them playthings. If we don't gather such rips peaches as that rosy one we but now saw growing in yonder meadow, some country poor will for us!' `Tell me truly, Fitz Henry Barton,' cried Morris, rising in the boat and looking him full in the face; `do you really believe that every young woman in humble life less regards her virtue, that priceless gem of all female honor, than those young ladies with whom we daily associate in town on terms of equality? Answer me, truly. `Whoy,' answered Barton, coolly, trailing his hand over the side of the boat in the water, `I am surprised you can think otherwise.' `I do think otherwise and I know otherwise! Such girls feel an insult as deeply as —yes, as your own sister would, Barton! They think as much of their personal honor, too, as the females of our own condition! You are in a great error when you assert the opposite to be the truth.' `What fills our theatre galleries, and our streets at night with courtezans, my dear boy? They are mostly of this class,' said Barton, scornfully. `Not innate love of vice in them—but treachery, false treachery in man! In nine cases out of ten the poor creatures are victims of broken vows—youthful wives, degraded through intemperate and worthless husbands, or worse still, poor and unprotected maidens tempted and tempted by the glitter of the gold and the fascinations and art of libertines! Nor are they all of this class—many of them have fallen from the sphere in which the highest and best now move! It is, alas! too common an opinion you entertain, and one that needs correcting.' `Fudge, Ned! all this indignant sentiment because I offered to kiss a pretty country lass,' said Barton, affecting to wear an air of indifference which he was far from feeling beneath his friend's severe language; `for all this I shall follow up my rustic amour.' `If you do, Barton, and wrong come of it to the young creature, I shall shake you off from my heart and hand as I would a serpent.' `Oh, you are too warm, Morris! Well, I will let her drop! But she is too fair to lose. Did you see what an inviting waist! what tournure and ease! Heigho? well, let her go; Here we are at the foot of your father's garden. Let us land.' The two young men possessing such opposite characters, landed at the stairs of a summer-house that projected over the water, and taking their lines and fish, proceeded in silence, by a winding gravelled avenue, towards the country house before mentioned as visible from David Woodhull's. Fitz Henry Barton was descended from an old Dutch family on his mother's side, and therefore belonged to the true aristocracy of New York; for, in the eyes of this class, Hendrick Hudson and William, the Conqueror, had the same relative rank. He was an exquisite in mind and manners. Nature had given him common sense, but art had perverted it. He was a gentleman by education and position and circumstances, in every thing except principles. In this he was sadly wanting. He was sensual, and therefore when he found it was a fashionable vice, very easily became a roue. His libertinism, however, had its limits. He was one of that species of hawk that will pounce only where its game flies low and is crippled. He never saw a pretty girl of what Mrs. Trollope aptly called `the second quality class,' without licentious emotions and regarding her as `fair game;' while in the presence of the young and lovely of his own condition, he never harbored thoughts unworthy them or his own relative social position—which is to say, that Fitz Henry Barton was a gentleman among his own condition, and a low, unprincipled debauche out of this sphere. Edward Morris, on the other hand, was a high-minded honorable man. He loved honor for itself and virtue for its own reward. He was a physician by profession, though his inherited wealth precluded the necessity of his pursuing it. He loved reading and the arts, and mingled freely in society, which he adorned and in which he was beloved. His elder and only sister had married the elder brother of Barton, and hence the intimacy of the two thus related—an intimacy of circumstances rather than of sympathy of minds. They were now in the country at the seat of Morris' father, it being the first time for five years he had passed any time there, college and European travel having kept him that period from his native city. He now made his father's house, both in town and country, his home. Barton lived in town in his own private rooms, which he had fitted up and furnished in the most sumptuous manner. Such was the character and condition of these two sportsmen whom Biddy so unexpectedly encountered. As she tripped lightly homeward, she could not help thinking to himself how rude and unpleasant one of them was and how handsome and generous the other. Fitz Henry, exquisite as he was, plainly suffered much by the comparison which she was busily instituting in her little head. At length the scales preponderated so decidedly in favor of her preserver, that she gave her thoughts from that moment wholly to him, quite forgetting the other. `How indignant he was!' thought she, `how his black eyes lighted up! How handsome his face is, and how gentle his voice was when he spoke to me. I am sure I shall never forget him in this world!' She said this as she reached the gate to the house, from which she now heard her name pronounced in every key in anger's gamut. She hastened forward, but caring less for her cross mother and sisters than she ever did before. She had something now in her heart pleasant to dwell upon. So she went in and received the usual three-fold scolding for her delay, after her father had got in, with great patience and went cheerfully about the tasks imposed upon her singing— `I'm o'er young to marry yet, I'm o'er young to marry.' The next day she was sent into the field by Euphrosia, who spitefully determined that she should be exposed to the sun, `Till,' as she said to Sally, `the pert minx who thinks herself so much better looking than other folks, is tanned black.' It was about noon of the next day that she was raking her swathe of hay, shaded beneath her good-natured father's old straw hat, and when she had got in her rake a heavy mass which she had made three several efforts to throw upon the hay-cock, that a hand was laid upon the rake, and a kind voice said to her— `I fear this is too heavy for you to lift, miss —allow me to assist you.' The voice thrilled her heart with strange emotions—but they were those of undefined and subdued joy. It was the voice that she had heard in her dreams all the last night? She looked timidly up and saw also the face that had mingled in those dreams. She smiled, and tremblingly resigned the rake. Morris looked his thanks and soon completed her task. `This is very warm work in the noon-day sun, for a young girl,' he said drying the perspiration on his forehead with his cambric kerchief. `No, sir, not quite so warm as in the house,' she said, archly; but, he being ignorant of how her domestic affairs stood in the family, this was lost upon him at the time, though remembered afterwards. David Woodhull lay beneath an apple-tree sleeping away the noon, in its cool shade. Morris cast a glance towards him, and then taking Biddy's hand playfully, yet respectfully, led her to the same tree and sat beside her upon a grass grown root. Why submitted she to be led so passively? The power was not in the slight touch of his hand, but in his eye, his smile, the sweet inviting expression of his whole face. Love had her in leading-strings, all invisibly to her. An hour elasped, and David Woodhull awoke, and so did Edward and Biddy from their happy waking dream! An hour had passed and Biddy was taught that she had a heart, and Morris also, found that he had lost his! An hour had passed! and in one hour a young couple can say a great deal and make wonderful progress towards friendship. It is useless to say all Morris said or all Biddy replied, with downcast eyes and tell-tale cheek. Suffice it that Edward Morris had been struck with the pretty hay-maker at first sight, and not having ceased thinking or dreaming of her, had resolved to pay a visit to the meadow to see her once more—just to get acquainted with her, and if she were worthy, devise some means to protect her from Barton's annoying libertinism. One hour in her society proved to him her worthiness; and when David awoke he had an impassioned declaration of his passion trembling on his lips. He hastily instead, pressed them to her hand and hastened away before her father was aware of his presence. `How fortunate that I did not commit myself, he said on cool reflection, as he regained the boat; `if I had done so I could never have unbound my honor from my passed word! What would my friends have said? Well, 'tis passed now! She is very lovely—so ingenuous, so unsophisticated! So sweet in manner yet withal charmingly brusque. I am certainly in love with her and I am glad it has gone no farther—that I have not interested her in me so that she will not speedily forget me! Yes, I will see her no more! Honor, principle, duty forbid it, for I can never marry her. Oh, this confounded opinion of caste, that will not let a man marry where his heart would! If, now, she were in my condition of life, I should not hesitate to cast myself at her feet and declare my passion and offer her my heart. Because she is a poor farmer's daughter I can, (if I am only a fashionable man,) but honorably seduce her, if I pursue her acquaintance. Out upon the hollow falsities of life! I must cease to think of her! Honor forbids all else! Yet I will watch over her lest this libertine, Barton, should meditate her ruin. The maiden, however low she be, who has interested the feelings of Edward Morris, shall be entitled to his honorable protection! If then she should be so honored, why not carry it further and honor her as my wife with an undisputed right to protect her? Nay, I can think of the subject no longer.' In half an hour afterwards during every moment of which he was thinking of this subject, he arrived at his landing-place at the foot of the lawn at his father's seat. Whether Edward Morris would have sought to see Biddy again or not, cannot be said, as he was the next morning unexpectedly called to accompany an aunt to Charleston, where he was absent, even at the time our story opens. In a subsequent part, we shall carry out more fully the fortunes of our characters, than the limits of a single chapter of this `work' will enable us to do, and show the effect of Morris' hay-making visit upon Biddy's heart and life. The remembrance of it was, as we have said, the only solace that enabled her to endure the tyranny of her mother and sisters, without a murmur.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II. `Love laughs at locksmiths.' The memory of the hour's tete-a-tete with the handsome young angler beneath the shadow of the old apple-tree, was all that sweetened, after his departure for Charleston, the bitter cup of Biddy's domestic servitude. At length, her amiable sister, Euphrosia, heard of this interview, through a rustic called Mike Moore; who witnessed it and told it in petty jealousy. It was during a visit to a neighbor's that the intelligence was whispered into her ear. That Biddy should have a bean first, and a city bean, that was not to be en dured by a young lady of her temperament. She made no delay in hastening home to vent her rage upon the lovely victim of household ill-humor. Biddy was sitting in the door pearing apples for a dumpling, and was singing, as her sister approached— `Some love to roam, Away, from home—' `Yes, you little jade,' cried Miss Euphrosia, untying the strings of her bonnet and removing it from her head with a flushed countenance; `yes, some love to roam, miss! in hay-fields, under apple trees, miss! with strangers, miss! I'll put a stop to this kind of pretty business very quick miss!' `What's the matter, Throsia?' cried the mother, coming out of the dairy with a roll of butter in her hand which she was working; `what's the jade done now?' and she cast an angry and suspicious maternal glance towards the silent, conscious Biddy. `Done, mother! she has been flirting and fooling with a young city gentleman she's got acquainted with some how. Yes, when she should have been making hay she was making love! I wish,' she added, spitefully, on reflecting how much she had herself missed, `I wish I had never let her go to the meadow! But who'd have thought it?' By degrees Biddy's mother got the whole tale from the mortified and indignant Miss Euphrosia; when she turned full upon the culprit, who with her blushing face half had in the dark curls that fell around it, bent her head over the pan of apples to hide her confusion. She was rather angry than intimidated, and while she feared her mother's wrath she could not but secretly smile at her sister's vexation and her own triumph. `So, Jade!' cried the mother stepping up to her and stooping so as to bring her face upon a level with her's; `so, you have been encouraging beaux! Pretty hay-making this; I'll teach you how to make hay! I'll give you beaux to be sure! What right have you to speak to a man? What right have you to let a man speak to you? A whole hour under the apple tree and that old fool, my husband, snoring away all the time, I'll wager! Oh, you little deception piece! Oh, you trollop! Who was the man?' `I don't know mother,' said Biddy. `Don't know! You shall tell! You'll get to be no better than you should be, yet! But I'll take care o'that! I'll make you tell who the villian is you keep company with! Won't tell! We'll see! Put down that apple-pan— put it down I say and come with me to the attic!' Biddy obeyed and silently followed the cross old woman to a little dark room opening upon the roof of the old farm house. `Now, miss!' said her mother, taking breath, `here you shall stay shut up just one week on bread and water! I'll cure your love and flirts! One week shall you stay, and then a week more if you don't let me know who it was Mike Moore saw you billing and cooing with under the apple-tree! Will you tell, jade?' `I don't know, mother,' said Biddy vexed and weeping. `Don't know, mother,' mocked Miss Euphrosia, from the bottom of the stairs; `lock her up, mamma, and let's see if it's `don't know mother at the end of the week! There is nothing like lock and key and bread and water for love and obstinacy. Finding she could get no confession from Biddy, her mother locked her in, though not without leaving her a large quantity of wool for her to card before night, saying she should have enough work to do, `if she was locked up.' Left alone, the youthful prisoner sat for a long time upon the edge of the low bedstead that nearly filled the room, and the tears trickled silently down her bright cheek. But Biddy's spirit was not such as readily bows to grief. It was keenly alive to injustice and could not endure insult or wrong. She reflected upon her situation, and felt that she was the victim of a species of domestic tyranny that might last until life itself ended. She felt she had done nothing to deserve all she daily suffered at the hands of her mother and sisters; and that in the present instance she was blameless. She knew not the name of her admirer. She had, therefore, told no falsehood. She felt she was unjustly and wrongfully punished. `Am I to endure this for life?' she said, her darkeyes flashing and her cheek burning; `no, I will be a slave no longer! I will quit this hateful house this very night! I will go to the city and seek employment. Other young girls have gone there and are doing well! Why may not I? I have to work and slave here at home, a common drudge—I can be placed in no worse condition in the city; and I may, at least, find people that will be kind to me! Oh, dear! this way I live at home will break my spirit! I tremble now at my mother's or sisters' step, or the sound of their voices. I will tremble no longer! I will run-away and take care of myself. The day may come when they will be glad to have the privelege of speaking to me, much as they despise me now! The West-Cheater stage passes the gate at five o'clock to-morrow morning. If I can possibly escape from this room I will be at the gate before any one is up and take it! I have five shillings of my own, and the fare is only half a dollar.' Having formed this resolution in her mind Biddy looked round her little chamber and collected all the scanty apparel that she could call her own into a bundle which she hid heneath the bed. She arranged more neatly a pretty artificial in her Sunday hat, smoothed out the ribbons and prepared all her travelling costume, as it should be. Soon as she had got all things ready for her elopement, she sat down and began diligently to card the wool her mother had left for her day's task, the mean while thinking of her apple-tree lover, and singing: `They told me not to love him, They said that he would prove Unworthy of so rich a gem As woman's priceless love. `What is that caterwauling up there in the loft, you miss,' cried the gentle Euphrosia; `mother did'nt look you up there to sing, I guess!' Biddy ceased her song and continued her carding, while her thoughts busily ran upon the mode in which she could best effect her escape. All at once she laid down her cards and stepped softly to the door. The lock was a large stout one, and the bolt went deep and firmly into its bed. A few moments examination convinced her she could not move it. Shaking her little plodding head she approached the window and softly opened it. It was what is called a dormant window. For several feet the steep roof descended from it to the caves, from which it was twelve feet to the ground. She surveyed this mode of egress with much misgiving; to slide safely down the roof and then descend to the ground, was a feat she hardly dare attempt. Yet she could see no other mode of escape, and resolved to attempt it towards morning, if she could find any thing by which to let herself down from the room. After a long search for a cord or a hank of yarn, and not being able to find any, she was forced to give up all thoughts of this mode of egress. Again she approached the door and carefully examined the lock. It promised to resist all efforts to move it. She was ready to give up all hopes of escape unless by the dangerous passage of the roof, the height of which intimidated her As her eyes wandered over the door she saw that a screw was loose in one of the changes. Instantly the idea occurred to her that if it were possible to remove the hinges she might escape at midnight through the door, and so by stealing down stairs, softly pass out of the house by the back door, which, as is customary in farmer's houses, was always left on the latch. With an eager touch she trembling took hold of the loosened screw. It yielded, and a few revolutions placed it in her hand. There were two more in the same hinge and three in the hinge below, all five of which, on examination, seemed to be too firmly driven to be removed without a screw-driver. After a moment's reflection, Biddy recollected there was an old case-knife among some nails and rubbish in a trunk beneath the bed. She soon had it in her hand, and to her delight, on trial, found that it fitted the head of the screws. To make sure, she applied herself to start one of them. After a little exertion it yielded. Great was her joy at this promise of success. The second also gave way to her broken knife, and in a few minutes she had loosened all five of them a single turn in their bed. `Now,' said she, with triumph, `all I have to do is to take off the hinges when every body is asleep and walk quietly out of the house. I feel already free. What will sister, Euphrosia, say! Oh, what will mother do!— Sally 'll be glad, because I shall be out of the way of offering temptation to her awkward swert heart, John Burn!' `What are you at here, miss?' suddenly cried her mother, bolting into the room. `I've been listening and hant heard a bit of carding for ten minutes! What are you doin,' jade, with that old knife?' `Nothing, mother,' said Biddy, throwing it behind the bed. `Nothing, I'll promise you. Oh, you are a good-for-nothing?' Here the old woman looked at her carding. `Not two bats of wool carded, as I'm a living woman. What have you been doing all this while? Tell me, or I'll wallop you if you was fifty years old!' `I've been carding.' `Carding!' repeated her mother, scornfully; `I could do in five minutes what you have been two whole hours at. Well, you don't go to bed this night, nor I neither, `till you get that wool all carded and batted, so you know what's best for yourself!' Here the maternal jailor was leaving the little prison in which she had confined our heroine, but turned back to say— `Don't let me hear any more singing, miss, if you do, I'll tie a handkerchief over your mouth, and see how you'll like that' Come now, work! I shall be in after night's milking to see if you have done your task.' With this parting admonition she left her to her solitude and carding. `Oh, how glad I am she did not get the knife,' said Biddy, as her mother closed the door at the stair-foot; `now I have that I don't care how much she scolds. Oh, I wish the night would come. Well, if I don't card this wool, I see it will interfere with my plan of escape, for mother 'll set up all night to make me do it. I'll work hard and have it done when she comes in and then she'll let me alone 'till morning. Dear, delightful morning, that is to give me freedom. It will then find the bird flown from its cage.' Biddy now set herself industriously to ply her task. She was naturally studious, and labor was rather a pleasure than a toil to her. As the sun set she completed her `stint,' and soon afterwards she received the anticipated visit of her amiable mother. Mrs. Woodhull looked sharply at her `bats' and then cast her eyes round the room and looked under the bed to see if none of the wool had been concealed to lessen the task. `Well, girl, you have got through, I see. It's well for you you have. To-morrow I'll give you so nothing else you'll not get through quite so easy. Here, Phrosia, bring your sister up her supper. Biddy heard a light malicious laugh from below and the gentle Euphrosia appeared with a tin dipper filled with water, in one hand, and a plate of the crust of bread held in the other. She could hardly conceal her exultation beneath a look of assumed compassion. Placing them on a chair she gave the prisoner a glance of malicious pleasure, made her a contemptuous curtsy, and left the room. Biddy would have cried with vexation if she had not determined on flight from her tormentors; as it was, she smiled quietly like one concious of having the victory. `There is your supper, trollop!' said her mother, in her usual cross tone; `bread and water, just as I promised you! It's all you'll get 'till your week's out. Now, you go to bed and don't let me hear any more singing.' `No, ma'm,' said Biddy, calmly and quietly. `You are quite cured, I see, with your being shut up. Oh, yes, I'll bring down your high look and proud spirit. Lovers. City beaux! I guess you'll care 'bont 'em after a week's living on bread and water. Now to bed, for I'll have you got out of it bright and early.' With this the old woman left her and went down stairs, from whence Biddy heard the hateful laughter of the tender Miss Euphrosia as she asked her mother how she relished the bread and water. `Yes, they may laugh to-night and I will laugh to-morrow,' said Biddy. `This hateful bread. They have given me what no body can eat. If I should stay here they would positively starve me. No one can blame me for running away from such a home—for leaving such an unnatural mother and sister.' Biddy drank a little water but left the stale crust untouched; then placing her bundle on a chair, and her neat Sunday bonnet upon it, and laying her old case-knife beneath her little pillow, she threw herself upon her bed without undressing, and was soon buried in profound sleep. Accustomed to wake at dawn to build all the fires, she did not fear over-sleeping herself; on the contrary, while asleep, she retained the consciousness of the purpose she had in view, and this consciousness caused her to wake just after midnight. She instantly, but lightly, started to her feet, and looked out of the window to learn from the stars, which shone brightly, the hour. Though she could discover in the east no traces of morning, she resolved at once to effect her escape from the house and wait by the road-side for the stage. Listening some time, and finding the whole house still, she put on a neat calico dress, her cottage hat, and best shoes, and sticking her old green parasol through the knot of her bundle, she took the broken knife from beneath the pillow, and approached the door. After pausing to be sure that all was quiet below, she felt for the hinges, (for the room was lighted only by the stars,) and after a few awkward attempts, she succeeded in drawing the first screw. In a few seconds the other followed, and the upper hinge was liberated from the door. Inspired by her success, to active exertion, the fair girl stooped to draw the three from the lower hinge, careful, the while, to keep the door in its place, lest it should fall upon her head, or, worse still, upon the floor, and so betray her by the noise. She had drawn one out, and was turning the second, when the knife slipped from her grasp, and fell at her feet with a sharp startling sound. Involuntarily she held her breath, while her heart ceased to beat! Full two minutes she remained immoveable, listening to learn if the noise had disturbed any one; but all was silent. Every one slept save herself. Again she renewed her work with more caution, and the last screw slowly yielded to her knife. The next moment, with a bounding pulse, she drew it forth from its loosened bed with her fingers. The most difficult part was now to be achieved. The door was made of heavy oak plank, and she feared that in displacing it, she might, from want of strength and light, let it fall to the ground. She was, however, not a girl to be checked by possible obstacles.— Standing up, she felt for the bolt which alone held the door, and as she did so, scarcely could she refrain from smiling at the emphasis with which she recollected her mother had last turned it to secure her, as if she had said, `Good bolt, I can safely trust you!' Fertile in expedients, Biddy, on finding the bolt would easily slide out from the side in which it was so strongly imbedded, to prevent the door falling upon her when she should move it, drew, without noise, her bedstead along, 'till a corner of it pressed against the door, and served as a supporter. Having made this cautious preparation, she took hold of the door by the side on which the hinges had hung, and exerting all her strength, drew it bodily towards her. As the bolt left its socket, the whole weight of the door was supported an instant upon her arm, which soon gave out, when it fell heavily over upon the bed which her sagacity had placed to receive it. A dead sound, not very loud, was all the effect it produced. She paused, and listened to see if the noise had awakened any one, when, finding all was still as before, she began to indulge the joyful emotions that filled her bosom at the prospect of securely effecting her escape. Taking up her bundle, and feeling in her bosom to ascertain if her little purse of five shillings was safe, she knelt down by her bed side, and softly and piously repeated the `Lord's prayer,' a beautiful series of petitions that, poor girl, she much needed to put up at such a time. Then with a light heart and a lighter step she crossed the prostrate door of her little prison. Accustomed to traverse the whole house in the dark, she found no difficulty in reaching the narrow angular stairway that led to the large family room below. Softly as a kitten and with as stealthy a step, she descended the stairs and opened the door at its foot and entered the room below. All was still, save the monotonous ticking of the old clock standing in the farthest corner, and the occasional sharp chirp of a cricket on the hearth, where a faint gleam showed the half-buried fire. She listened to detect any sound from her mother's room, which was on one side of the family room, or from her sister's which was on the other. She could only hear her father snoring. Gaining confidence she stole across the wide room and laid her hand, dark as it was, readily upon the wooden latch. She hesitated ere she raised it, for a feeling of loneliness and desolation came suddenly over her. She was leaving the house of her infancy—the roof of her child-hood, perhaps for ever! her father, too, whom she loved, possibly never to see him more. She felt desolate, and her heart swelled with grief at the cruel fate that should drive her thus young and unprotected from the home which should have been the natural asylum of her youth and innocence. And whither was she to go? For what was she to exchange her present unhappy lot? Was she going to a happier one? Such were the thoughts that passed through her mind as she stood with the latch half lifted in her fingers; but this natural emotion was temporary. The next moment she raised the latch and crossed the well-worn door stone into the night air! She immediately experienced a sensation of freedom and elasticity of spirits. Her pulse bounded—her feet scarce touched feet the ground as she flew over it in the direction of the high-road, which was half a mile distant. The meadow where she had first seen Edward Morris, lay in her course. As she came to the stile that led from the domestic yard or lawn into this field, she heard a noise behind her. She bounded in alarm over the fence, and at the same instant, her favorite old house-dog, Bruin, was at her side with a fierce bark! `Down, Bruin,' she said, in a low, authoritative tone as the dog caught her bundle in his glittering teeth The noble dog recognized her voice and crouched at her feet. `Go home, Bruin,' she cried, stamping her little foot on the ground. The dog crouched lower and licked the shoe that enforced her command. `No, you shall not go with me! Poor Bruin, I shall not see you for a long time,! fear! Who will now pet you and feed you! I know you will miss poor Biddy, for one I Go back!' The affectionate animal still kept his almost supplicating posture at her feet. In vain she scolded, in vain she caressed him! If she ran forward a few yards, he would bound joyfully by her side; and, when she stopped to reprove him, he would crouch silently at her feet. `Well, then, if you will come, I cant' help it,' she said, in a tone that conveyed to his understanding all which the words could have done to a human being. With a quick, short bark of delight, he now bounded on before her, and his very happiness rewarded her for her condescension. Bruin was a large, noble barn-dog, affectionate and faithful. Biddy had petted him from a pup, and a mutual affection had grown up between them! She now felt happy that he was with her, for his presence cheered the loneliness of her way. It was her determination, however, to make him return when she got into the stage at the gate; and so, together, they went across the meadow, 'till Biddy reached the old apple-tree. Here she paused, and seated herself just where Edward had sat beside her that sultry noon, and indulged her heart in thinking over the whole sweet interview, and all that he had said to her, and in recalling his gentle smile and the rich tones of his low-keyed voice! She sat there full two hours, so lost in silent reminiscences, with Bruin lying watchful at her feet, she was wholly unconscious of the flight of minutes. The distant rattle of wheels along the turnpike first roused her from her dreams of the past. On looking round she saw that morning was already tinting the east, and that the sun would soon be up. Blushing herself like the roseate morn, she took up her little bundle, and, followed by Bruin, hurried across the meadow to the hedge which the two young fishers had bounded over, one to insult, the other (how dear in memory that other!) to rescue and defend her! After she crossed the hedge she hastened along a narrow foot-path, by the side of the creek, towards a wide bridge which she had to cross before getting to the turnpike. She at length reached the road just as the stage came in sight. `Now, Bruin, you will have to go back,' she said patting him and half embracing his shaggy neck, as if taking farewell of her favorite. He rubbed his nose in her hand and pressed against her affectionately. `Yes, but you must go, as I can't pay your fare,' she said, in half playfulness half in in earnest, as the driver on discovering her with the bundle by the road-side, drew up his horses. There were but three passengers in the stage, a farmer, an old woman, and a young man, all of whom were asleep. `Whoa, oah! wo! Want a passage, miss?' asked the coachman, throwing his lines over the back of his box and preparing to descend from it to open the door. `Yes, sir,' said Biddy. `To the city?' he asked, as he closed the door after she had got inside with her bundle. `Yes, sir.' `I'll take your fare, miss—fifty cents.' Biddy searched for her little purse and drew from it four short shillings and gave them to him. The goodnatured driver looked at them in a hesitating way a few seconds, as they lay in his palm, and then shaking his head and smiling as he gazed upon her pretty face, said— `Rather short, miss, but as your little purse seems to be full as short, and you are a pretty girl, I'll let you ride for this;' and Dick Sherwood pocketed the four ten-cent pieces, mounted his box, and dashed along towards the city. It was the first time Biddy had been in a stage-coach, and the novelty of her situation for awhile drew her attention from her present object. Every thing pleased and interested her. At length, as the sun rose, they entered the little village of Fordham, and her fellow passengers awaked, at the stopping of the stage at the inn, to change horses. Once more started, they dashed on towards Harlem, and traversing this town entered upon the Third Avenue, which, for five miles, approaches the city in a straight line, a noole and magni cent thoroughfare! Swiftly the stage rolled over the Macadamized Avenue, and Biddy looking from the window, soon beheld the towers and spires of the metropolis, while on her left was the Sound, lively with vessels and steamers, and its shores adorned by the beautiful country seats of opulent merchants. As she approached the junctlon of the Avenue with the Bowery, she delightedly recognized the surrounding houses and churches, for she had twice been to the city, in the family wagon, once with her father, two years before, and once with her mother and sister, with marketing. She therefore had some idea of the place which she was entering, and whither she had come to seek her fortune. As the stage rattled over the pavements of the Bowery, she turned her eyes from the bewildering seenes that attracted her gaze, on either crowded side-walk, to decide her thoughts on some mode of conduct, that she might pursue on being landed at the stage-office. She could think, after much reflection, of no better course to adopt, than to seek one of the intelligence offices, of which, in common with all other country lasses living in the neighborhood of the city, she had heard much; and like them, thought she had only to go there to get employment at once. What this employment should be, she had not decided! Vague ideas of milliners and mantua-makers, sempstresses and tailoresses, housemaids and childrens' nurses, flitted through her little head; and the stage drew suddenly up at the office before she had determined what she should be. She sat still, undecided and irresolute, until the other passengers alighted. As the coachman offered his hand for her bundle, she said for the first time feeling the embarrassment of her situation— `Will you be kind enough to direct me to an intelligence office?' `Certainly, miss,' said Dick Sherwood, bluffly; `so you've come up to service, then? Too pretty a face to be trusted here unless you have some body to look after you! Here, you darkee,' he cried to a negro lad lounging in the sun on a bench near by, `you know every crook and corner in York—show this young woman a respec'ble 'telligence office: When you come back, come to me and I'll give you a silver sixpence.' `Done Boss,' said the African grinning; `I knows firs' rate 'telligem office, up in de wecinity ob de Battery and City Hall.' `See then you take her to it, and make no mistake.' `Boss nebber know nigger make mistake when de silver in de bargain. Come, missus, I'll show you de way. Leff nigger car' him bundle.' The coachman kindly assisted her from the stage, and struck with her innocence and beauty, he cordially shook her by the hand, as she left him saying— `If as how, miss, you don't get along so well as you expect to here in York, and want a friend, you'll always find one here, at No. 21, that is, provided you behaves yourself vartuous; 'cause I am a family man, with a wife and seven children of my own. Good bye, and bless your sweet face! it'll be your best friend or worst enemy, in this wicked world! Now start, you nigger and be civil to the young woman, or I'll—' and Dick finished the sentence by making a significant gesture with his doubled fist. `I thank you, sir, for your kindness,' said Biddy, `I hope I shall one day be able to repay it.' `Confound it now,' said Dick Sherwood, to himself, angrily, `that's al'ays the way! I can never do a little sarvice but I must be paid for with a `thankee.' I never gets any body in my debt for a good turn. I likes, miss, to do a good sarvice, but I don't like to be thanked for it. It is too much like quod for quid, as the lawyers say. Now go and follow that nigger, and may you get a sitivation to suit you, for I knows you deserve a nice one.' Biddy again thanked the kind coachman, with a grateful glanee of her bright eyes so long as he forbade her to do so with her tongue, and, happy at finding even so blunt a friend in the great lonesome city into which she had thrown herself, tripped lightly after the negro; yet her heart was lonely and heavy. Every face was strange! She had gone but a few paces, when she felt something coldly touch her hand, for Biddy wore no gloves. Shrinking and looking down, she gave a scream of delight and surprise. It was good old Bruin! He had followed the stage all the way to town, keeping a cautious distance behind it, and now approached her and thrust his nose into her hand. It was like meeting a dear old friend! She forgave him for the happiness it gave her to see him once more. He evinced his joy in his own rough way, in finding he was no longer an unwelcome companion, and sticking close to her side, accompanied her through the long and thronged thoroughfare, a faithful friend and attendant. She patted him on the head and felt that much of her loneliness and desolation had vanished with his presence. `Yes, good Bruin, you shall stay with me if you wish to—it shall not be my will that parts us,' she said to him, as he trotted along looking up in her face and occasionly casting a suspicious glance at the negro, between whom and his mistress there existed some kind of mysterious relationship, which he could not understand. All at once as they entered a narrow street, he bounded from her side and smelled at the bundle carried by the black. The next instant he tore it from his grasp with his teeth, and brought it and laid it at Biddy's feet. `What are you doing, Bruin? He is carrying my bundle for me. Don't be so rude!' Biddy restored the bundle to the alarmed negro, with a reproving glance at the dog, who shrunk along beside her with an ashamed look, 'till by a kind word she restored him to her confidence. `Dat big dog, mighty sharp, missus,' said the negro who at every step glared his round white eyes over either shoulder to see if he was likely to be assailed again in the discharge of his function as porter. `He'll not hurt you,' said Biddy, smiling at his fears. `He hab mighty sharp teeth, missus! Yah, yah, I tink he sensible dog—yah, yah, yah! guess he tink nigger steal um bundle.' `Is the intelligence office a good ways from here?' she asked, anxious to reach it. `Jiss roun' de firs' corner ob de secon' street, seben doors from de nex one—gi! I knows de place like de primmer!' Leaving Biddy on her way to the intelligence office, let us return to the farm-house she had left. Just as Biddy was startled from her pleasing reminiscences of the hour in which Edward Morris had won her guileless heart, by the rattling of the stage coach, Mrs Woodhull was awaked from her sleep by a more than usually sonorous snore from her lord, or rather vassal, David Woodhull. It was just the peep of day, the hour busy house-wives love to rise and set to work! Her first thought was of her prisoner in the attic. Hurrying on her clothes she hastened forth from her sleeping-room and opened the stair door. She listened all was still. `The jade! She sleeps sound enough for all her bread and water! Biddy—Biddy Woodhull,' she screamed, up the stairs. But Biddy was being whirled along the turnpike in a stage-coach, and could not hear her.— `Why don't you wake up, you lazy thing, you?' added the mother in a londer and angrier tone. `If I come up there, I'll wake you up, with a vengeance!' Again Mrs Woodhull listened, and all was still. Quicker than old women usually move, but not cross old women, she hastened to the water pail and filled a great pitcher with water. Softly she crept up stairs into the dark attic and felt her way to the door. She felt along, and felt along, still all was vacancy! `Where can the door be?' she almost spoke aloud. She took another step forward, struck her shin against it and pitched headlong upon it. The pitcher was smashed, the water deluged her to the skin, and her nose was broken in the fall' The noise of this mishap, added to her screams of fright and fury, awoke Miss Euphrosia from a dream of a spruce Chatham street beau who was in the act of falling at her feet when her mother fell over the door; awoke Miss Sally from visions of connubial bliss with John Burn, and rcused David Woodhull to his feet as if the house had been on fire. `Oh, what is the matter?' shrieked Miss Euphrosia and Sally, flying from their room in their night dresses. `I am killed and murdered! Mercy, help!' shrieked their mother, while the water from above leaking through the floor, fell trickling upon their faces. `Yes, yes! she's murdered! I feel the blood!' shrieked the delicate Euphrosia, and she tried to faint but could not for want of sufficient blood of her own. `I'll soon know what's the matter, gals,' said David, striking a light; and hastening up stairs in his drawers, followed by his daughters, they soon saw how the whole affair stood! Mrs Woodhull had got to her feet and was wiping the blood from her nose, while her dress dripped with water. As soon as the light appeared she recovered her self-possession and looked around. The door, for which she had been feeling, instead of being its proper place, lay upon the bed, and she had stumbled over it as she now saw! A glance told her that its hinges had been on the inside, The whole truth flashed instantly upon her ready mind. `Where's Biddy?' she cried, looking under the bed and in every part of the room. `She's escaped!' `Where, how?' cried the sisters, bewildered with surprise. `Not by the window!' `Window! Fools! What need of jumping from windows with a door off its hinges, and laid on its back to walk over, yes, and to break one's neck over? She's got off in the night by going down stairs! Here's the knife I saw her have in her hand. This was her screw-driver!' `And she's taken her clothes and best Sunday hat with her!' cried Miss Euphrosia, in unalloyed astonishment. `And her parasol, too!' exclaimed Sally, who found no trace of it after looking about the room. `She shall pay for this,' said Mrs Woodhull, compressing her thin lips with spiteful rage. `She's gone to some o' the neighbors with a doleful story of being locked up. I'll lock her up and tie her too, if I catch her again. `Perhaps she's gone to the police-office, to complain,' said David, whose indiguation sometimes got the better of his fears of his wife, and who now felt angry that Biddy should have been locked up, of which he had not known before; `I've hearn of parents being put in `the Tombs,' there, for ill usage to their children.' This was a great and bold speech for David and it produced the effect he Intended. Mrs Woodhull turned pale, and so did the amiable Miss Euphrosia. `Well, she was obstinate and wilful,' said Mrs Woodhull, as if excusing herself to her alarmed conscience; `and if a mother isn't allowed to manage her own children, I wonder who is?' `Well,' said the pale and guilty Miss Euphrosia, `I'm sure sure I never treated her bad!' `Well, you'll hear on her agin, I reckon, in a way you won't like,' said David, grown bold at his success, and inwardly rejoiced that his favorite had shown such spirit as to escape from the tyranny which he daily witnessed, but could not prevent. `Now, I guess, you'd better hold, your peace, David Woodhull,' said his wife, letting her wrath, her fears, and shame, all fall upon him; `if I catch you saying your soul is your own, if Biddy should ever peach me, I'll make this house and farm too hot to hold you.' With this characteristic menace, the several inmates of the family separated to their rooms to dress, variously affected by the extraordinary discovery they had made. Biddy had flown! The mild, gentle, submissive Biddy, had run away! Mrs Woodhull had to repeat it over a dozen times to be able to realize a truth so astounding; and when she did, trembled at the consequences that it might lead to, and she repented, when too late, that she had been so strict and tyrannical a mother to her. Her conscience told her that Biddy was right in flying from home; her fears pictured to herself the escaped prisoner making her complaint before the village magistrate, or, what was still more to be dreaded, the terrible New York Police. Leaving her and her amiable daughters to their wonders and conjectures over the mysterious disappearance of Biddy, and trembling at the personal consequences to themselves, we will follow, the lovely girl to the intelligence-office, to which we left her on her way, escorted by Bruin and the negro.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART III. Biddy followed her African guide by a marvellously crooked way, which none but a negro could have taken, through lanes and cross streets, up alleys, and across squares, and turning corners, `till her own head turned with the bewilderment, confusion and noise, that prevailed around her; her temples ached with the roar of wheels, and her feet, familiar only with the green sward, were pained by traversing the unaccustomed pavements. At length he stopped in front of a low, two story wooden building, situated in a close, crowded street. It had a flashy yellow front, and the window-shutters and sides of the open doors, were covered with written and printed placards, headed, `Wants.' Biddy looked up, and saw on a little sign hanging above her head from a projecting iron bar, `Intelligence Office,' done in gold letters upon a brilliant blue ground. On little tin plates tacked up each side of the entrance, she also read the same words. `Yes, this is it,' she said to the negro `I am glad I have found it, for I am very tired. Here is your pay for bringing my bundle,' she added, tendering him the last shilling she possessed; `the kind coachman offered to pay you, but I would rather do it myself. You must tell him I did so, now.' `Trus' nigger for dat, missus,' said the black, with a grin, and extending his sable thumb and finger for the piece of money; `I'se tell him, fac' sure!' `I hope you will, good fellow, for I wouldn't like to have a stranger pay for me,' said Biddy, with that natural independent spirit we has already shown she possessed. `Nebber you f'ar, missus; I'se too much ob gem'lan to do any ting unhon'ble,' said the black, lifting his ragged cap, and making a scrape; `I is sure tell him, missus!' With this assurance he laid the bundle on the shelf of the office window, and with his eyes fixed misgivingly on Bruin, moved off at a slip shod gait to the next corner, around which he had no sooner disappeared, than he struck up a double shuffle on the side-walk, keeping time with his hands against his thighs, in the merriest manner. He kept this up for about a minute; and then said, chuckling— `Ki! yah, yah, yah! Sam Jonsing hab play de financy, dis time, right up stair, an' no mistake! Little Missus tink I no make Boss Dick plank de prog too! Yah! Elebenteen pence for car' bundle! Him short ten-cent piece, I 'clar!' he added, looking closely at it; `she cheat niggar out ob two cent an' half a one! ki? I'll make Boss Dick pay his six pence. How she tink nigger gen'l'man keep him word, ven de vhite gen'l'mans don't. Yes, sartin sure, Sam Jonsing, you is defalter dis bressed mornin', an' no mistake.' Here Sam pocketed his silver, and shuffled off to No. 21, Bowery, where the rogue was again paid by honest Dick Sherwood, on his making oath over the handle of Dick's whip, that he had taken both the bundle and the young woman safely to her destiuation. Biddy's eyes had unconsciously followed her late guide 'till they could see him no longer, when she felt as if she had parted with the last link that bound her to her species. She sighed at the sense of her condition, and tears came unbidden to her eyes. Suppressing them with an effort, she stopped down, and carressed Bruin and soon recovered her self-possession. On looking about her, she saw that several females, old and young, and chiefly Irish, were standing on the side-walk, conversing in little knots, or waiting with anxious looks in the door-way. There were two large square windows, projecting, one on either side of the narrow door leading into the office. These windows were filled with hills and placards, all expressing the wants of individuals in nearly every condition of life. Her attention was particularly fixed by some written notices, wafered upon the shutter against which she leaned to rest herself, her hand upon her bundle, which lay upon the shelf of the window, and with Bruin at her feet. How her eyes beamed with hope, as she read with breathless interest a long list of wants. As she felt confident she had only to offer herself to obtain a situation. `Now,' thought she, `as there are so many for me to choose from, I shall hardly know how to choose. `A smart girl for general house work,” she said, repeating to herself the first notice; `that must he something like my work at home! I can't choose that. `Apprentice to learn straw-sewing.' That must be pleasanter than general house work. But then I'm told they work the apprentices to death in this city, and that any of them can be told in passing them in the streets, by their pale and sickly looks, and thin persons. I would rather work hard, I think, (if it is thought more genteel to be a 'prentice,) as a house girl! `Neat girl for general house work!' Here is one wanted just my age, where the work is light. This is better than at home, and perhaps I might find kindness. I will keep this in my mind. A first rate sewer to make dresses. That I should like' I can sew well, and always make my own dresses? I'll think of this place too.' Thus did our heroine run over in her thoughts the several situations so temptingly proffered to all in need of employment, and in their multiplicity and variety, her mind was lost! She, for some time, could come to no decision, but finally decided on one or the other of the advertisements, viz; the second and fourth? So absorbed had she been in forming her resolution, that she blushed, and blushed, and became confused and vexed, on looking round, and seeing that half a dozen Irish and Scotch girls standing before the office, had been all the time making themselves merry at the absorbing attention with which she was scanning these placards. Pouting her beautiful lips as girls of sixteen sometimes will do, when offended, she took up her bundle, and entered the office. It was a deep, narrow room, with a desk latticed in all round, on the left, near the door, and a long wooden bench placed against the opposite wall its whole length. On this bench were seated some twenty females of all ages, from ten to fifty years; waiting for situations as nurses, cooks, chambermaids, seamstresses, etc. The majority of them, thought Biddy, seemed very contented at sitting there and having nothing to do all the forenoon; and she saw that they amused themselves with watching those coming in and going out, and listening to the negociations of the man behind the desk, with those who were applicants for places. Biddy dropped her veil before the gaze of so many rude and insulting eyes, for she felt that each one looked upon all subsequent comers as interlopers and rivals, who might possibly forestall them in a place. Notwithstanding the occasional laughter, and childish romping of the poor creatures together, she could not but see the envy and hatred rankled in their breasts towards one another. Most of them were neater dressed than she expected to see servants that were `out of place,' and all, without exception, wore red or white cotton shawls, and brown cotton gloves. It seemed, to her—so much they looked and dressed alike —to be an Intelligence Office uniform! Nearly all of them were pock-marked, and scarce one face in the whole was good looking. Biddy made these observations at a glance, and with a sinking heart took a seat beside an old woman in iron spectacles, plaited cap, and an old second hand quaker bonnet; who seeing her waiting till the Intelligence office man had got through with a gentleman who had just come in, and who wanted a child's nurse, had made room for her to be seated. She felt grateful for the offer, for she was both fatigued and embarrassed. She felt, too, that by a little delay, she could see how business was done, and the experience might be of service to her in enabling her to apply for herself in a proper form. Shrinking from observation, she drew her veil half aside, and observed what passed that she might profit by it; for she keenly felt her utter ignorance and helplessness now that the crisis of her position approached. Her first glance was directed towards the desk. Within the latticed enclosure, sat a little, thin, sallow man, with brushy, black hair, a low, fleshy forehead, keen black eyes, a long sharp nose, and a large lipped, ugly mouth, filled with decayed and snaggled teeth. He wore half whiskers, very long and silky, a white cravat and a black coat of three fashions agone. Such was the untoward appearance of Beal Tucker! He looked like a snivelling, mean man, who would sell his soul for three pence, and his heart and character did not belie his looks. In his fingers he held a counting-house steel pen; a book of entries lay open before him, and he was looking up beneath his covert eye-brows, listening to the gentleman who was giving him through the bars of the lattice a description of the kind of servant he wanted. `Yes, sir, I think I can suit you to a t,' said Beal Tucker, dropping his large black brows, and examining the book in which he recorded the names, ages, character, occupation, and address of the applicants for situation, on receipt, in advance, of fifty cents from each applicant, who, by this douccur, became entitled to his services for a period of three months to aid in obtaining them places. Without this payment in advance, and the registering of the names on his book, no one, though sitting in his office, could be allowed to take a situation that persons called on him to have filled. Biddy had yet to learn this disagreeble fact! `Yes, sir,' said Beal Tucker, after examining the book, `I have one here that will just suit you. What is your address?' `'Tis here,' said the gentleman, giving him a card. `Ah, yes! Mr. Sancroft!' said Mr. Tucker, in a humming half tone, and drawing near another book in which he entered the names of those who wanted servants, he quietly recorded the address in a very handsome hand, of which he evidently was proud as one of his numerous accomplishments. `Is she here present?' asked the gentleman, a young married man, looking round with visible confusion upon the array of woman's eyes that sought his, each female hoping to be herself selected. `Yes,' replied Beal Tucker, coldly. `I should like to see her.' Beal extended his hand, with the palm significantly turned upwards, and said in a bland voice— `Fifty cents, if you please.' `For what?' asked the novice in Intelligence offices. `For registering your name, and sending a nurse to you,' answered Beal, with a sneer of contempt at the gentleman's greenness. `But she may not suit.' `I will then send you another and another, 'till you get one that suits you. I cannot pay rent for a room for girls to sit in all day, 'till people come and take 'em away to places, nothing for it.' The gentleman seemed to see the force of his reasoning, and placed a half dollar in Beal's extended palm. The fingers instinctively closed over it, and something like a smile gleamed in his eyes. `Mary Cotter!' he called aloud, like a school-master to a pupil. `Mary Cotter! where is she?' he asked angrily, opening his latticed door, and looking over the room.— Every head was turned in search, and at length there was a general exclamation from the women that she had gone out. `Then she deserves to lose her place,' said Beal, petulantly. `Hush that noise and jabbering there, in the further part of the room, he shouted to two or three young Irish girls of fourteen or fifteen years of age, beating each other with their bonnets, to the amusement of those around. `If I hear any more noise, I'll turn you out!' All was still as death, for Beal's voice was like thunder, and carried terror with it to the hearts of his unruly petticoat subjects. `Here's a young American girl,' he added, `wanted to take care of a baby—experienced and good character, and all that! Who wants the place?' There was a general movement of heads but no one replied. `Is there no American girl here?' `Yes, sir, I'm one,' said a thin, shabby-respectable old maid, who, poor creature! looked as if she had drank the cup of poverty to its very dregs; and she came with a hesitating step towards the desk. There was a general scornful titter among the Irish women and wenches, as the applicant, with her left arm hugging together the fore part of her lank garments, laid her right hand, bony and blue with famine and time, upon the corner of the desk. Biddy's generous spirit resented this unfeeling expression of their scorn, but she reflected that they were all perhaps nearly equally as wretched as the victim of it, and had no pity or compassion to spare for others. It is the degraded poor who are ever the most bitter and unfeeling to the poor and miserable. `Yes, you're American what there is left of you,' said Beal Tucker, with a laugh at his wit; `the gentleman don't want a frame, I guess! I' thinkin' he'd rather get a nurse as is already got her flesh laid on.' `No good woman,' said the gentleman, seeing she shrunk from the cruel language of the unfeeling brute, `I fear you will not quite suit me; I want a young and healthy person! Perhaps this will atone for your disappointment!' and he placed a dollar in her hand. `That's what I call throwing pearls before swine, if I might be so bold,' said Beal, who witnessed this generosity with surprise.— `She'll get drunk before night.' `Indeed, sir, I never get drunk,' said the woman, earnestly. `Don't tell me no, when I say yes! Go to your seat or off out o' the way; its no use for you to stay here any longer Nobody'll come for you but the doctors.' `I have paid you my half a dollar Mr Beal,' said the poor woman pleadingly. `And you have been loafing here nearly three months on it.' `There sits a young person whose appearance prepossesses me,' said the gentleman, disgusted, and wishing to change the subject; `call her this way.' `Jane Mannus, the gentleman wants to speak to you, come up to the desk,' said Beal sternly. `Here, you old hag of bones, stand out of the way, and make room!' `Are you an American girl?' asked the gentleman, of a very pretty, modest, ruddy-cheeked lass, of about sixteen, with brown hair laid neatly on either cheek, and large, clear blue eyes, She hesitated, colored, and dropped her eyes, though not before she had caught Beal's meaning glance for her to say `Yes.' After a moment's silence she looked up, and with a frank, open countenance, said— `I will not belie my counthry, sir, for the sake of getting a situation. I am an Irish girl.' `How long have you been in this country?' asked the gentleman, smiling, and as much pleased with the blunt honesty of her reply, as Beal was vexed by it. `Sinct I was eight year, sir.' `You may send this young woman to my house at four o'clock,' said the gentleman, turning to Beal; `she will, perhaps, suit us.' `Very well, sir, she shall be there,' said the Intelligence office keeper, as the gentleman left his little despotic empire. Then writing upon a printed card prepared with blanks, his address, with her name and occupation beneath it, he gave it to her with the injunction to be at the place designated, precisely at four o'clock. Jane received it with a curtsy, and soon after left the office, elated with the prospect of getting `a place.' Biddy, our heroine, had silently observed all that had transpired, and she found that she had learned something by seating herself down and waiting. She felt delighted to see with what ease places were obtained by those suitable to fill them. But she had much yet to learn. `All I have got to do,' she said to herself, `is to ask him who it is that wants a straw sewer, or a girl for light housework, and he gives me a ticket and sends me to the place! What excellent things these Intelligence offices are for poor girls! Now if I had to pay the half dollar, instead of the person that should want me, what would I do when I haven't a cent in my purse!' I will not be afraid of these women here, but go right up and ask him before some other person gets the place!' As she came to this resolution, a melancholy-looking young woman came into the office, and approached the desk. Everything she had on was faded, and she was without stockings. Beal Tucker eyed her sharply through the bars, and then said abruptly— `Well what's your business?' `I want to get a place, sir,' she said meekly. `Place is a broad word! One would think there was but one place, or you was the one for all places!' and the Intelligence office lord chuckled at his own wit, and looked around upon the Irish and Scotch women for applause. In the eyes of servants seeking `place,'—be it observed, in passing—an Intelligence office man is a very great man, and by and by he very naturally begins to think he is so himself! Beal Tucker was, in his own opinion, a very great man! `I meant no offence, sir,' said the young woman. `No, ah. no, I guess you didn't! I guess you'd know better than to give offence to me.' No young woman nor old woman never did it! No one would dare do it!' `I'm sure they wouldn't, sir,' said the applicant, humbly. Beal was pleased and mollified by the manner in which she spoke this, and said blandly, `Well, what place do you want? here's cooks, chambermaids, all house-work, seamstresses, child's nurses, lady's maids—every thing but wives! and I might supply them too for a fair premium! he, he, ho, ha!' `I'd like a situation to do house work, sir.' `You are too delicate, young woman. A seamstress would suit you better.' `Oh, no, sir! It's sewing that has injured me—working fifteen hours a day, and no exercise, and earning, at that, but two shillings a day. I wish to do house work, sir.' `Well, I'll look out for you. Where's your half dollar?'—and Beal Tucker's palm lay open upward on his desk, before her. Tremblingly she drew from the bosom of her faded frock a bit of green silk. She unfolded it with a sigh, and displayed to the greedy eyes of Mr. Beal Tucker, the whole of her little store, viz: three quarter dollar pieces,a pistareen, a ten cent piece, three pennies, and a soiled Murphy's omnibus ticket. She separated two of the quarters, and placed them, with another sigh, in his hand. Biddy, all forgetful of her own needful situation, pitied her, and wished she could pay the half dollar for her. But instantly the thought flashed upon her, `How shall I pay it for myself?' Poor Biddy! how, indeed, was she to pay for herself? Now that she saw farther into the mysteries of intelligence offices, she did not think they were altogether just the benevolent institutions for aiding young females she at first believed them to be.[1] [1] Since the occurrence of this story, gratustovs es have been established by benevolent societies. Now that she discovered that servants seeking places were charged half a dollar, as well as those who came to seek for servants, she became very much embarrassed, and her self-possession, for a few moments, nearly deserted her. What should she do? She must obtain some situation before the day closed, but to obtain it, she must pay in advance! `Oh, where shall I get this money? what shall I do?' were questions which she put to herself fifty times.— She looked round upon the women in the office, for some kind, sympathizing face, for she felt like seeking and asking sympathy. But every one looked selfish and forbidding. Her eyes then sought the harsh visage of Mr. Beal Tucker, against whom she had already conceived a prejudice. But she could read only in his countenance, avarice and half dollars. Poor Biddy! she was in a sad perplexity. At one time the idea struck her, of going from house to house, and asking for employment, as this course would not require money. But a seecond reflection convinced her of its folly, and probable frultless issue; else, if it were possible, why did not the poor women around her, ill able to spare a half dollar, pursue this course, and save their money? Tears at length filled her eyes, and drawing her thick green veil over her face, she let them trickle freely, for it relieved her heavy heart. `What ails thee, my pretty miss?' at length asked the old woman in the faded quaker bonnet, who had asked her to take a seat beside her. `I am without money,' said Biddy, hastily drying her eyes, snd speaking with that frankness of innocence which conceals nothing from the designing. `I did not expect to have to pay.' `So you thought to get a place for nothing; he, he, he! Poor child! you don't know Intelligence offices well as I does.' Biddy thought she had known full enough of them, and felt no inclination to learn more. Encouraged by the old woman's sociable mood, she ventured to ask her if she thought `the intelligence man' would not get her a place, if she would promise to pay him with her first wages. `Well, sich things has been done, when folks is known; I'll ax him for you.' `I wish you would,' said Biddy, with grateful earnestness, `for I haven't courage to do it myself.' `I'll do it, poor thing!' she said, good naturedly; `but then I don't think but with your pretty face you'd do better with Beal Tucker than an old woman. There's them as knows him, says he likes a bright eye; and what intelligence man don't? I can tell you, miss, there's young girls been sent from these places more than once, that wan't advertized for in print, by them they went to!' Biddy would have asked her the meaning of her words, but she immediately called out in a shrill tone from where she sat— `Mr. Tucker, here's a young voman as is without money, and wants to know if as how you would register her name, for a place, and let her pay you the `half' from her first wages?' Biddy's face burned with shame and confusion at this open address, and felt that all eyes—as, in truth, they were—directed towards her. Twice she caught the old woman by the gown to check her, but in vain. `A young woman without money, hey?' gruffly repeated Beal Tucker, without looking up from an advertisement he was writing for the morning's paper. `Yes, and more's the pity, for she has a pretty face that should bring her gold.' Whether it was `pretty face,' or the magic word `gold,' or both that caused Beal Tucker to stick his pen on the top of his ear, and look through his bars towards the speaker and her confused protege, must be left for determination after his character shall be more fully developed. But certain it is, that he looked very hard, and with increasing interest at Biddy, as one after another the perfections of her foot, waist and hand, were revealed to his practiced eye. `Humph,' he said, after a moment's survey, which satisfied him that Biddy was of a superior order of beauty to any he had seen in his office, though he had not yet seen her face, which she kept concealed by her veil. `Humph!' and he gave a second and closer survey; which determined his conduct. `Young, is she, Aunt Kitty, and no money?' he said, in a tone of mock sympathy; `bad, very bad!' and Beal Tucker shook his head as if he had heard she had committed a great crime. Biddy never before felt that it was so wicked thing to be without money. Again Beal scrutinized her. `Suppose, young woman, you put up your veil,' he said, coarsely; `perhaps, after I see your face, I can tell whether to trust you or not.' Biddy's cheek burned at this rude address, but instinctively raised her hand, and put aside her veil. If Beal Tucker had been before struck with the symmetry of her figure, he was now filled with surprize at the fresh and youthful beauty of her face. He would have started back with an exclamation at this discovery, but habitual caution enabled him to restrain all outward expressions of emotion. `Didn't I tell ye she was a pretty one?' said the keen old woman, exultingly, on observing the effect which he vainly would have concealed even from her penetrating gaze. `Hush,' woman, he said, in a tone of stern reproof: `come hither, miss,' he added, carelessly nodding to Biddy. She hesitated, when the old woman, raising her from the bench, thrust her forward. `Why don't you go, child? He'll trust you, I know by his eye—he, he, he! won't you, Beal Tucker? `Silence,' thundered Mr. Tucker. `So, young miss,' he said, assuming the blandest expression he could bring his forbidding countenance to wear, `so you have no money, and want a place?' `Yes sir,' answered Biddy, in a low, timid tone. `We don't wish to be hard with you.— What place would you like?' `I saw a straw sewer advertised for sir!' `That place is taken, I am sorry to say,' answered Beal, with an insinuating smile, shaded with regret `There is a person wanted to make dresses,' continued Biddy, beginning to feel the first bitterness of disappointment. `I am sorry to say that place is also engaged,' said Beal, who gracefully leaned over his desk in one of his favorite attitudes, and from which he had not moved since she came before him. `Can you think of nothing else?' `I can do general house work, sir,' said our heroine, now willing, so embarrassed was her situation, to accept of any employment that would relieve her from it. `House work!' repeated Beal, with surprize. `Oh, no! Go and sit down, if you please, 'till I get through with some little business, and I will look over my list and see what I can do for you.' And all the while Beal Tucker's eyes were drinking in the intoxicating draaght of her beacty. Biddy felt relieved by his words, and as she took her seat, began to think she had taken too hasty a prejudice against him. It was then about eleven o'clock, and Biddy sat there until twelve, a silent observer of all the singular scenes that transpired. As the clock struck twelve, Mr. Tucker, who had been long impatiently waiting to hear it, briskly shut up his books, and opening the door of his latticed den, said, in a hasty tone, `Twelve o'clock! Home to dinner, girls, and let me to mine. I shan't be open again, 'till two, to-day!' There was a general preparatory movement among the women, and those near the door began to quit the office. `Home! dinner!' sighed Biddy; `and am I to wander in the streets 'till two o'clock, perhaps all day, as he has not asked my name to regester it?' `Come, miss, with `the pretty face,' don't block up the way!' said a savage looking Irish woman, thrusting her rudely aside. Biddy stepped aside, and stood still until nearly all had left the office, when, recollecting that she must act with more firmness than she had hitherto shown, she took up her bundle to go, and spoke to Bruin, who, all the while, had lain under the bench, where he had crouched when she first seated herself. Beal Tucker had his eyes upon her, however, and did not mean she should leave without his seeing her again. She was stepping across the threshhold, when he artfully called, as if just accidentally rememebring her presence. `Oh, young woman, there, in the green veil! I had like to have forgotten you. Just wait a moment, and I'll give you a ticket to a place that I think will just suit you. You can pay me any time.' These words, though addressed to Biddy, were also intended for the ears of the two or three that lingered in the office, as an excuse to them for detaining her. She heard him with a sensation of joy, and hope once mors shone in her hitherto downcast eyes, as she turned back. Beal Tucker re-entered hie desk, and opened one of his books. The old woman in the quaker bonnet still lingered in the door. Beal looked at her angrily: `What do you stay for, old woman? Go! I'll now just examine my books for you miss.' `The place you mean to give that miss, you'll not find on either of them books o' yourn, Beal Tucker,' said she, chuckling, as she stepped from the door. `Begone!' cried Beal, his color heightened by anger and guilt. `He he, he!' chuckled the old woman, as she disappeared from the office. `Sit down, miss—these old women would vex the —, devil, Beal would have said, did he swear, but being as he often boasted, a `reg'lar moral man,' he never indulged in profanity; being so strict, therefore, he ended by substituting `saints' for the devil. Biddy re-seated herself, pondering in her mind what the old woman meant, by saying the place that he intended to give her, was not found on his books; but she was too young and innocent of the world, and of evil, to arrive at the truth. Beal now pored for a few moments, seemingly with great earnestness and interest over his list of entries, but his eyes, instead of falling on the page, were scanning, from beneath his pent house brows, the lovely and ingenuous features of our heroine. At length he seemed to look as if he had come to some satisfactory decision, to which he intended to conform his intermediate conduct. `What is your name, miss?' `Bridget Woodhull, sir,' said Biddy, looking up, and answering, while one hand laid on Bruin's shaggy mane. He pretended to write it on the book, but really wrote it on a card, which he had previously laid upon the page. `Where do you live?' he asked, in a low tone for persons were constantly passing the door. `Sir!' said our heroine, embarrassed by the question. `Where do you live, my dear?' `In West Chester county, sir.' `When did you come to the city?' `This morning, sir, in the stage, to get a place.' `Have you worked out before?' `No, sir.' `Are you acquainted in the city?' `No, sir.' `And you have no money?' `I gave my last shilling to a black man, who showed me the office, not knowing I should have to pay to get a place.' These questions were answered with a directness and frankness singularly contrasting the duplicity and double intention with which they were put to her. Beal Tucker looked at her for a few seconds, and a singular smile passed across his face. `Yes,' he said to himself, `she shall be sent to him, and he shall pay well for so rare a treasure. By-the-by, miss. how came you to leave home?' `Because, sir, my mother and sister's treated me very badly.' `So you run away, eh?' `Yes, sir, I did,' answered our heroine, with mirth mingled embarrassment. `Better still,' soliloquised Beal Tucker, rubbing his hands, and showing his snaggled teeth with secret delight. `It's a fair prize!' he added, aloud. `Sir,' said Biddy. `I said this dust was bad for sore eyes. I will shut the door 'till I make out your ticket.' And the plausible Beal Tucker left his chair and closed the street door, confining it, unperceived, by a finger bolt. He then returned to his desk. `What place do you think you would prefer, pretty one?' he said, in a tone of gallantry, and looking, as he conceived, very loving. `A dress maker's, sir,' answered the unsuspecting maiden. `Suppose you just step into the desk, and look at the list, yourself,' said Beal, in his most insinuating manner. By this time, Biddy had discovered, what every other true woman would have done, that there was mingled in Mr. Tucker's manner, a good deal of freedom and pretension. In a man exactly like Beal Tucker, such demonstrations could not be very acceptable to any one: though his victories and frequent lip-favors from some of his hideous `out of place' servants had a tendency to inspire him with great confidence in his powers in that line Biddy instinctively felt the moral impurity of his presence—for a chaste woman, like the sensitive plant, involuntarily shrinks at proximity with a libertine. This instinctive feeling or sense, Biddy now experienced, and she began to entertain fears at being in his presence. When, therefore, he desired her to enter his desk, she declined, saying, with firmness, `that she would leave it to him to name a place.' Beal was struck by the tone and manner, and looked at her suspiciously, for guilt is ever on the alert. A glance was sufficient to tell him she feared him, and had instinctively divined his feelings towards her. Beal only intended, however, by inviting her to his desk, to steal from her ripe lips a kiss: for though sensual and unprincipled, he loved gold much better than lust, or the gratification of any other passion, that he was always prepared to sacrifice all of them for it. Gold now protected Biddy, not only from baser designs, but even from the insult to her modesty that he had intended; for he meant to be paid in gold coin, even for the kiss he feared to take, now that he saw she knew him. Besides, Beal Tucker had a wife up stairs, and he had come to a conclusion, in order to forward a purpose he had in view, to invite Biddy to dinner. `Oh, very well then,' he said, in a tone which he intended should restore her confidence, `I will act for you.' He then looked over his entries, and said, `Here is a lady wants a dress-maker, and will pay good wages. Will that suit you?' `Yes, sir.' `Very well, then, I'll recommend you.' `I thank you, sir,' said Biddy. `I will be sure to pay you from my very first wages.' `No doubt, no doubt,' said Beal, with a sardonic smile; `here's your ticket. Let no one see it, but when you leave here, go directly to the house No —, Chambers street.' `Yes, sir,' answered Biddy, about to go. `No, don't go yet. I dare say you haven't had breakfast or dinner.' `No, sir,' answered Biddy, for the first time conscious of her long fasting. `Well, then, come into the next door, upstairs, and take dinner with my wife, and stay there until I get back. You had best give me the ticket, and I will give it to you again when I return.' Beal then opened his door, and stepping to the next, called up the stairs to his wife— `Mrs. Tucker, I say! Mrs. Tucker.' A woman with a red head, a red face, and a red baby in her arms, came to the stair head, and shrieked back, `Well, what you want, Beal?' `Here's a young woman come for a place, and as I can't attend to her just now, having business out, give her some dinner, and keep her until I come in. You understand me.' Mrs. Tucker understood him. The two were not only one, connubially, but in all else. `Yes, Beal, send her up. Oh, there she is. Come up, miss.' Biddy, who at first, resolved not to go with Mr. Tucker to his dinner, on hearing a woman's voice in reply, took confidence, and with the faithful Bruin bounding after her, went up stairs at her invitation. Beal saw her safety up, and then gave his wife a significant wink; when seeing her return a comprehensive glance from her pink edged eyes, he closed his office, and hastened up the street towards Broadway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART IV. THE EXQUISITE. About half an hour before Beal Tucker dismissed his flock, and left his office, a young gentleman opened his eye-lids, and looked gapingly round a luxurious chamber, but half lighted by the ray of noonday that streamed in penciled lines of silver through the closed shutters. After yawning thrice very loud, and very long, like one who feels that he is master of the premises, he turned himself slowly over in his bed; he then, with an effort, raised himself on his elbow, and showed a handsome yet very pale and haggard face, as if he had been at some late carousal the night previous. He remained in this position, immoveable, full five minutes, the while contorting his flexible features into hideous and loathing grimaces, and, at intervals, smacking his parched palate as if he had a bad taste in his mouth. At length he raised himself from his elbow, and sat up in bed, letting his head fall upon his breast, and his whole person droop into a trist and depressed attitude. It was Fitz Henry Barton, the morning after a `dem fine spree.' He sat for some time in this very penitent-looking position, and at length made an exertion to reach his watch from beneath his pillow. He looked at the time by the faint light admitted through the shutters, and said in a weak tone, `Half past eleven—dem this wine, I feel sick! Half past eleven! Frid! Frid, I say!' There was no answer, for his black servant, Frederick, was holding a tete-a-tete out of the library window, with the yellow chambermaid in the chamber window of the next house. `Frid! you dem Frid!' replied Mr. Fitz Henry Barton in a louder key; but his voice was not yet strong enough to penetrate the door. After listening awhile, and finding he was not heard, he slid down from the side of the bed, crossed to the fire place, and gave the bell a very fierce pull for such a quiet person as he was. The jingling started the chambermaid from the window, to put the forgotten coverlid on her bed, and the valet from his, to hasten to wait on his master. `Wat in the devil deu you mean, Frid, by not being in the way when I awake?' remonstrated Mr. Fitz Henry Barton, in a nervous tone of petulent anger. `Don't you know I always want you by me when I wake?' `Beg pardon, massa,' said the genteel valet, opening one of the upper shutters, and hastening to put his master's dressing gown upon him; `I vas jis comin' vhen I hears massa ring.' `I tell you, Frid, you must always be at the door; what can I do alone by myself, when I wake up? It's dem unhandsome, in you, Frid!' he said, in a complaining voice. `I know it, massa.' said Frederick, with a downcast look; `an' I promises neber gib offence ebber no more.' `Now see you don't, Frid, an' I'll maybe forgive you this time! Where's my gin-cocktail? Don't you know I am good for nothing —just like a dem rag in the mornin', 'till I get my gin-cock-tail? Don't you know that, Frid! `Yes, massa,' said Frederick, placing Mr. Fitz Henry Barton's Indian moccasin's on his feet, and then going towards a marble slab in one corner of the room, on which stood empty champaign bottles, glasses, decanters, etc. There was also upon it a ready made gin-cock-tail, which he placed on a silver salver and brought it to his master. The sick and miserable Barton seized hold of it with a nervous hand, and putting it to his lips as a thirsty man would a draught of fresh spring water, drank off the strong and bitter tonic concocted of gin, sugar, and `Sloughton,' Those who have never dissipated at night, and, in consequence, awakened late after it the next morning, can know nothing of the misery, bodily and mental, the victims of wine parties suffer! Horror in mind, and depression of body—fever of the brain, sickness at heart, with the mind tortured by imaginary fears of evil, that no mental effort can shake off, make the situation of the walking debauchee a foretaste of infernal torture! To drown this horrid night-mare of the waking inebriate, recourse is had to artificial stimulants to create opposite sensations: and as, also, the body is relaxed by its previous idulgence, its tone and nerve must be restored by the same means? It is this which makes intemperance so difficult to care; for the debility and horrors consequent on to-day's inebriation, must be drowned by astrong potation the first moment of waking on the morrow. So the drunkard goes on. Till even stimulus ceases to act upon the nervous and depressed system, and he sinks into an early grave. As none who have not experienced it, can appreciate the misery of the first waking moments of a man after a night's intemperance, neither can any such form an idea of the magic effect of a gin-cock-tail or a glass of bitters in dissipating it. No sooner had Fitz Henry Barton drank off, with many a wry mouth, the restoring morning draught `Frid' had mixed for him, than a change came over him as instant as it was striking. His eyes, before heavy and laden, lighted up, his white lips became red, his pale check ruddy with the hitherto stagnant blood, and his whole person seemed to become animate and elastic with new life and vigor. He looked no longer the wretched and pitiable object he had been a few minutes before; but his face wore a buoyant air, and his voice, as he spoke, was natural and firm, though something elated. Such was the magic effect of a strong draught on the debauchee! But the victim of it, in quaffing it, had made compact for the through out, with the demon of the intemperate: for having given his spirits the pitch to which health and sobriety keep those of temperate men, he was under the necessity of keeping them up to that point by successive potations through the day, or fall again into that hell of depression from which it had lifted him! If Fitz Henry Barton could have had resolution enough to encounter, and bear for a day or two, the horrors with which he waked each morning, he would soon have found that temperance would give him that elasticity and happiness of spirits which he now foolishly sought for in successive potations of intoxicating poison! The first day in a drunkard's reform, is the great day of his trial! Perhaps when the hour approaches in which the reformed inebriate is accustomed to take his dram, which he has resolved no more to touch, it is the most miserable of his life! The first dram given up, is the most effective blow to the chain of his slavery. A drunkard resolutely withstanding the temptation to drink while the hour he is accustomed to indulge in passing away, presents a moral spectacle that angels may gaze upon with admiration and astonishment. Such denial is God-like. The human mind singly itself, can accomplish nothing morrally greater! But we are not writing an essay on intemperance! Fitz Henry Barton was a new man now that he had taken his bitters. Let it not be be supposed from the forgoing remarks, that he was an habitual drunkard! He was no more so than a great many young men of his rank, who yet hold their position in society. He never was seen staggering in the streets, unless by watchmen—but then he didn't care for `Charlies.' No one ever saw him drunk in Broadway! He could `carry a good deal,' as the phrase is, and his systematic drinking through the day, began to show its effects only towards evening. And all gentlemen, it was expected, would be a little lively after dinner; particularly fashionable young men! Oh, no; Mr. Fitz Henry Barton was no common drunkard! Besides his gin-cock-tail on rising, and a glass of wine bitters just before breakfast, to give him an appetite, he never took anything 'till two hours afterwards, when he would chance to drop into the Astor or Globe, where he always found some friends. With them, in the course of an hour, he would take a brandy sling, after a while, a rum julap, and then, perhaps a gin sling. He would then walk Broadway, and, possibly in his way, stop in at the City Hotel, or the Washington, and take another gin sling. As the dinner hour approaches, say an hour before it, he would take a gin-cock-tail to correct his stomach, and half an hour afterwards a `wine bitters;' a quarter of an hour before dinner, he would take another with a `little more bitters,' and a few moments before dining, take a gin-cock-tail, made stiff with `Stoughtons.' Such was Mr. Fitz Henry's usual daily routine of drinking, for each glass he took, craved its successive one, and he changed his drinks as the different degrees of depression of his spirits and system, made it necessary. There are a great many `moderate drinkers' like Fitz Henry Barton! At dinner he never had any appetite, and loathed his food. He could eat nothing without vinegar upon it; his whole taste was vitiated and palled. He would drink but little wine at the table, for its taste was insipid to him, compared with spirits, and when he dined at home, alone, he always substituted brandy. After dinner he always took a tumbler of stiff brandy and water, and then drove out to Burnham's, or on the avenue. Yet with all this drinking, Fitz Henry Barton managed to get along through each day, without exposing himself in any marked way, but every night he went to bed more or less drunk. He could toe a line, so well he preserved his self-possession, while walking home, but once in his door and hid from the public eye, he would stagger through the hall, and often have to be carried to bed by his faithful `Frid. `Well, Frid,' he said, in a cheerful tone, as he now felt the bitters warming in his veins, `what have you got for my breakfast, hey, boy?' `Omulet, nice ham, and coffee, Massa Barton,' said Frid, placing his cravat and vest beside him, and otherwise assisting him in his toilet. `I made him already,' said Frid, grinning. `I know massa want him dis mornin'.' `How did you know that, Frid?' asked his master, arranging his chin, whiskers and mustache before the mirror. `I members well you always axes for black tea de mornin's after you wommit in de hall.' `Pah, beast! you make me sick! Yes, I was ill last night, dem'd ill, Frid.' `Any body'd know dat,' answered Frid. `Did I totter—that is, did I stagger—from weakness, I mean, Frid.' `Yes, Massa Barton, e-yah, yah, yah! and you took me for a watchman, and giv' me a black eye.' `Capital, ha, ha, hah; So I gave you a black eye, Frid?' repeated Mr. Barton, laughing immoderately, and evidently much gratified at this feat. `Let me see, Frid!' And the valet removed a handkerchief which his master had not before noticed he had tied over one eye, and displayed the swollen member. `Ha! excellent! Scientific! Neatly put. Frid, eh? I have some science in my knuckels, hey?' `Werry scientifically done, Massa Barton,' said the good natured Frid, covering his eye again. `Now, massa, as you have made you toilum, all but de boots and coat, please walk into breakfast.' With these words Frid opened a door, and Mr. Fitz Henry Barton, wrapped in his Indian dressing-gown, indolently rising from his velvet arm-chair passed through, while he held it open, into a small but elegant library. The book-cases, and also one case of rare shells, were of rose wood gilt; the books gorgeous with gold and ornamental binding; the carpet rich, and returning no sound to the footstep; the ceiling beautifully painted in fresco, by the inimitable pencil of a distinguished fresco painter in New-York; and the sides lined with crimson fantenils and low ottomans! It was altogether a recherche apartment. But Mr. Fitz Henry Barton was a rich young man and loved such outward testimonials of opulence. Near the centre of the room, stood a small round breakfast table. He threw himself into an arm chair beside it. Frid handed him a paper, which he had opened and dried for him, and then poured out his black tea. Mr. Fitz Henry glanced with a fashionable air over the columns of the paper, and not seeing any thing that particularly struck his fancy, threw it on the carpet with a— `Pshaw! the papers are losing all their wit: Nobody used up this morning! no crimcons! no interesting police reports! no pretty gearls brought up! no run-a-way matches, no seductions, no murder cases!' Here Mr. Fitz Henry Barton took a slip of black tea, and nibbled a bit of dry toast. But he evidently ate because he felt nature required it. He seemed to relish nothing. Beside him stood his usual glass of wine-bitters untouched. He looked at it two or three times, as if he would stretch his hand for it, but some association made his taste revolt, and each time he turned from it with a loathing `pah!' `I don't know what's the matter with me. Frid: I feel worse than usual;' and he placed his delicate hand on his stomach. `Frid, I think you may give me another cock-tail!' `Yes, Massa, said Frid, hastening to obey. `No, no, these dem cock-tails don't agree with me this morning! Give me a wine glass of pure gin, with a dash of marischino on the top! I think that will do—I feel so faint about the stomach! You did'nt make the cock-tail strong enough.' The truth was, that Mr. Fitz Henry Barton's stomach began to crave something stronger each day; spirit weakened with water, could no longer continue to act upon it. He felt this to be the case, and for the first time in his life, resorted to clear spirits. He drank off the fiery liquid which Frid handed him, and after the unpleasant burning in his palate had gone off, he confessed to Frid that he felt much better. `Very much better.' `Yes, Frid,' he said with earnestness, `gin and marischino is the thing! Its a drink for a gentleman. Dem gin-cock-tails! What do you drink, yourself, Frid?' `I never drinks,' answered Frid. `True, that is proper. None but gentleman should drink. Ambrosia is for gods, and gin for gentlemen! understand that Frid. It's dem Latin I took it from! Has Jack Rawdon been here to call on me, Frid?' `No, massa.' `Jack's a fine feller, Frid—a dem fine fellar. He has no money but then I lend him, and so he's always flush! I like Jack—devil of a fellow among the gearls! Frid, give me a segar!' Frid obeyed. `Regalias! None but a gentleman should smoke Regalias! Bought them at Anderson's! Dem pretty gearl there. Frid! Jack Rawdon and I bet which should run-away with her. I bought these segars just to ask her to meet me. She smiled, and when a dem woman smiles, I alwass takes it yes, Frid. I went to the place in the Park, and met, instead, her dem brother, a stout handsome dem sailor feller. He set upon me and would have whipped me but for my science, Frid. I have kept away from Anderson's since. Jack and I have found out seven pretty gearls we mean to try and seduce. It's ripe fun for us young bloods! Two of them are milliner's apprentices; one of 'em keeps in a confectionary store, and one is a widow's daughter; the others, I believe, are snug little chamber maids. There is another I have in my eye, Frid, down in the country, and if Ned Morris stays in Charleston much longer, I'll drive down there, and run off with her. Ned, you must know, has taken a shine to her, and he's so dem'd virtuous, it'll do him no good to flirt with her! I'm half a dem'd mind to drive down there to-day! There's fine sport for a man of mettle in New-York, Frid! Do you know I keep a man in pay, to look out for pretty nice gearls from the country for me? Well, I do! and he's driven more than one pretty fish to my net. I pay well, you know. I don't mind money. Thus the fashionable Mr. Fitz Henry Barton ran on from the effects of his last exhilarating potation, and as he did not expect Frid to reply at all, and as the prudent valet was too well accustomed to his master's way to do so, he might have continued talking 'till he had revealed all his gallantries to his valet, and the effervescence of his spirit had passed off. But just at this instant his street door bell rung with a sharp business-like pull. `Eh, demme, Frid! Ther's the bell. If it's Jack Rawdon, ask him to come up. Jack's a dem good fellar!' Frid left the room, and soon returning, said that a man who refused to give his name, wanted to see Mr. Barton privately. `Privately!' repeated the exquisite, elevating his eyebrows. `Oh, ah! But how does he look, Frid?' Sallow and thin, with black brows, and black coat,' answered Frid, giving an accurate description of Beal Tucker. `Ah yes,' said Barton with a start of pleased anticipation, `I think I know who he is! Show him in, Frid.' Beal Tucker, who had waited in the hall, now entered the library and made a very low and sycophantic how to the elegant occupant —but Beal Tucker did reverence to the representative of money, not to the abstract man, for with all his low cunning and avarice he had a true knowledge of men, and particularly of the personage before him. Mr. Tucker therefore, bowed very respectfully to Mr. Barton, who gave him a sort of familiarly condescending half nod, at the same time saying, in the affected tone he assumed before all but his man, Frid. `How ar' ye, Tucker? I'm just at my breakfast, you parceive! Fashionable to breakfast at noon! Nobility in England all do it, my boy!' `Yes, sir,' said Beal; `and I don't see when a 'Merican gentleman is rich, why he shouldn't do and act like any noble of 'em all. Its money makes the man, in my 'pinoin, Mr. Barton.' As this was rather equivocal flattery, Mr. Fitz Henry Barton choose to notice it only by a doubtful stare; and then waving his right hand for Mr. Beal to take a seat, he waved his left for Fred to quit the room. There was a moment's silence on the part of the par nobile fratrum after the valet left the library, which was occupied by Mr. Barton in smoothing the coat of his segar by rolling it between his thumb and fore-finger, and by Mr. Beal in twisting his old black hat round between his knees by the string of the inside leather. At length he looked up beneath his beetle brows, and, to do him justice, looking very mean and guilty, and said, hesitatingly— `Wall, Mister Barton, I've called to see you on that little matter of business we had a talk about onct. I hope we are alone!' `Yes, Tucker, quite alone. So you have come to tell me you have some dem pretty rural!' `Why not exactly so, Mister Barton, at least just yet—but—' `But what—dem it, Tucker, you have lost your speech!' `I only wanted to know if you are willing to give me what you promised me if I send you a nice young girl from the country?' `Yes—from the country! I would'nt give twenty dem dollars for one of these pert, hackneyed city girls that, if they continue virtuous, loose all that pretty bashful modesty that's so dem delightful, you know, Tucker! I'm tired of the city dem beauties, and want to have something unsophisticated!' `And you will give me one hundred dollars if I will send you such a one?' asked Beal Tucker, his eyes lighting up in anticipation of soon possessing this sum. `Pon honor!—that is, if she is pretty and young, and rural!' said Mr. Fitz Henry Barton, throwing his head back in his chair, and exhaling the tobacco smoke from his pipe in a long spiral wreath towards the painted ceiling. `Will you give me that in writing. Mr. Barton? asked the cautious Beal. `Why, Tucker,' said Barton, carelessly, `it would be dem'd awkward, you know, for both of us if such a writing should, by accident, be seen by any body else. I cannot put anything on paper.' `She is a very beautiful, and not a day over sixteen,' said Tucker, artfully. `If you should see her you'd double the money.' `Demnition, Tucker,' cried Barton, starting with pleased surprise, `then you have one at your office!' `Not in my office exactly,' said he, evasively, `but in the city.' `Young?' `Sixteen, not a month over.' `Beautiful?' `She will astonish you when you see her as much as she did me. I never beheld a prettier countenace!' `Fine figure?' `Perfect, from head to feet `Tall or short?' `Middling height.' `Dark or fair?' `A clear brunette.' `When did she come to the city?' `This morning.' `And is now?— `At my house.' `Done. Send her here and the money is yours!' `Give me your hand on it, Mr. Barton,' said the wary villian; and he extended his dark thin hand towards the exquisite. `Dem and demnition, Tucker!' cried Mr. Fitz Henry Barton shrinking back from the contact; `do you think I am going to shake hands with you like two boxers before a set-to?' `I can easily keep the girl from you,' said Tucker, moodily, and advancing towards the door. `I don't force her upon you. Pay me fifty dollars down on the nail, and fifty tomorrow, come!' `Well, Beal, have it as you will. Recollect I trust you altogether here! You know my taste.' `She will suit you, or I will give back the money.' `Dem the money, Tucker; I want a pretty girl. There's a fifty,' he added, drawing it from his pocket-book and twisting it across the table to him, `Now go and send her here directly. Mind, you let her make no dem blunder, now.' `I'll take care for that, Mr. Barton,' said Beal, placing the note carefully in an old leather wallet crammed with advertisements for servants; `she'll be here before two o'clock!' `You're a good fellow, Tucker, dem good fellow. Will you take coffee?' `Thank you—I'm just going home to my dinner?' Dinner? My soul, Beal, how can you eat your dem dinner at one o'clock?' `By thinking its my breakfast,' said Tucker, with a sneer, as he was leaving the room. `Good afternoon, Mr. Barton.' `Good morning to you, Mr, Tucker! Now, there goes a fellar that dines at one o'clock and says `Good afternoon' before dinner at that. In my opinion its demnition vulgar to say `good morning' before one has dined if it be not till eight o'clock. But what more can be expected of an Intelligence office man? So, I am to have a dem'd adventure! I must prepare my toilet! Frid, where are you, Frid?' `Yes, massa,' said the valet. `Have you shown the fellar out Frid?' `Yes, massa.' `Well, Frid, I'm going to dress now! Remove the brikfast—assist me at my toilet. I expect a female visitor on private business.' `Yes, massa,' said the initiated valet. `After you show her up, you can lock the front door, you know, and have the afternoon to yourself if you want to walk out.' `Yes, massa,' said Fred, with a pleased look; and he began very assiduously to aid his master in his toilet. First Mr. Fitz Henry Barton took a bath in a handsome and convenient bathing-room opening from his bed chamber. After the bath he threw on his wrapper and Fred gave him a stiff brandy and water. He then prepared to dress himself. Without descending to such particulars as his silk shirt, his silk drawers and his silk hose, his stays, and his very fine white linen with ruffles half an inch wide on the bosoms, and laced wristbands, we will mention that he put on a very handsome pair of fawn colored pantaloons, made by C. &amp; K., the straps of which Fred buttoned over morocco pumps. His braces were elegantly worked with the needle and the buckles to them were gold. He then put on a white satin vest and a white silk cravat, which he, after fifteen minutes practice, tied with exquisite taste in a square bow. Fred then dressed and perfumed his long hair, parting it with the nicest precision on the left temple; perfumed his mustaches and whiskers with odoriferous oil of Persia, delicately sponged his face over with water and then powdered it with perfumed powder of pearls. Mr. Fitz Henry Barton then washed his hands in sweet scented water, touched his lips with strong cologne to give them color, picked out a hair from his nose-tip with tweezers, took a general and then minute survey of himself in a full-length mirror, when his vanity, to which Fred bore his testimony, pronounced that he was `dressed.' `I think I'll do, Frid, eh?' he said approvingly, as he surveyed his handsome person, while it must be acknowledged, he had dressed very elegantly. `Now shall I put on a coat or my Chinese dressing gown sent me by my friend Kellog from Canton?' `If massa Barton 'spect to see lady, him handsome Chinum dressing gown jist de ting to take 'em eye,' said Frid, whose own eye had been taken by the rich and brilliant dies of this elegant garment. `Well, Frid, I believe I will wear that.' Fred assisted his master in putting it on, when Mr. Fitz Henry Barton looked in the glass and pronounced himself irresistible. `I'm quite a handsome fellar, Frid.' `Yes, you car' all afore you in York for dat much, Massa Barton,' said the flattering servant. `A country girl, if she was as dem pretty as Queen Mary, should feel herself demnation honored, I think, by my notice, eh, Frid?' `If Mass' Barton go to England Queen Victory would fall chock dead in love with him, sure' `Think so, Frid?' asked the exquisite Mr. Barton, in whose mind the idea seemed to have taken a hold. `For sartin, Mass' Barton,' said Fred, decidedly. `Well, I dare say I am as good looking as Prince Albert! I mean to go to England one of these days, Frid. New York is too parvenu. What's the clock, Frid?' he added yawning. `It must be two.' `Jiss two to a—. There is the door bell.' `Run and show her up, Frid. Don't let her suspect but what she is to see a lady up stairs. `What a dem loud ring she gives' `Mass' Barton tink Fred fool,' said the valet, as he hastened to obey `Now for the charming rustic,' said Mr. Fitz Henry Barton, walking the room with an expectant look of villainous joy; `Tucker is prompt, dem prompt. Charming adventure this. Oh, the exquisite dem little rural. Frid has opened the street door.' When Beal Tucker returned to his dwelling he found Biddy Woodhull had made a very comfortable dinner and was full of expressions of gratitude both to him and his wife, for their kindness. `Poh, poh! I do it every day—what's the cost of one dinner—not five pence, certainly not six and a quarter. I have been to see the dress-maker and she says she should be glad to engage you, especially when I told him, I mean told her, what a pretty, that is, what a nice industrious young woman you was.' `Oh, thank you, sir,' said Biddy, thinking she had judged Mr. Tucker uncharitably, in suspecting him of designing any improper liberties with her. `Not a word. Here's your ticket—but uo matter about it. Ask for Mrs. Fitz Henry. She may be out when you are shown up, but her son will be in, and you can wait for her.' `Yes, sir.' `Have you any handsomer dress than that you have on?' `Yes, sir, in my bundle.' `Very good. Go in the next room with Mrs. Tucker, and she'll assist you in changing your dress. Mr.—I would say, Mrs. Fitz Henry always likes to see persons dressed and looking as neat as possible.' `Yes, sir,' said Biddy, and retiring with Beal's wife, soon re-appeared, looking remarkably neat, and, if possible more interesting. Her appearance with her pretty hat, was tasteful and genteel. `Yes, yes; two hundred dollars, full!' said Beal to himself, as he looked at her, `and he will pay it willingly. Two hundred dollars! a good round sum to earn for one day's job! I find the `perquisites,' he added, facetiously, `bring me more than my regular profits. Well, Miss Bridget, you look quite charming, now! Don't she, Mrs. Tucker?' You mind your own business, Beal. You have no more to say, or do, or look, in this matter, than just to get your money, and no more.' Beal looked abashed, and then from the window called to him a little boy who sometimes went on errands for him. `Here, you Jim,' he said, as the boy came up stairs, and stood playing with his bare toes, `show this young woman to No. — Chambers street! Don't mistake! the number's right on the door.' `I can read figure's, I guess,' answered Jim, pulling up his ragged trowsers for want of a pin to fasten them to his dirty-colored shirt. `Well, see you do. Here, Miss, you can follow that boy; he'll show you right.' `I haven't my ticket, sir.' `Oh, never mind the ticket. It was only so you shouldn't forget the number of the house. The boy'll show you that,' answered Beal, who was too cautious to entrust her with a paper that, very possibly, might be produced in evidence against him. As it was, he knew that no one could prove he had sent her to Chambers street, or, at least, to Mr. Fitz Henry Barton. Villany is always sagacious! `Good afternoon,' said Biddy, taking up her bundle. `I shall remember your kindness.' `Good bye,' said Mrs Tucker dryly. Beal was about to hand her down stairs, when Bruin who had lain under a bed in the room, suddenly bounced out in his eagerness to follow his mistress, and running against him nearly overthrew him. `What in all creation is that?' screamed Beal, catching a glimpse of the dog's tail, as he dartcd through the door at the bottom of the stairs, into the street. `It's Bruin, sir,' said Biddy, laughing. `Who's Bruin?' `My dog, that followed me from home. He won't leave me.' `He must not go with you there! He don't want a place!' said Beal, who feared the dog might, in some way, be the means of bringing his employer into mischief—possibly be the means of betraying her presence there. `Call him back!' and Beal ran to the door and called angrily, `Dog, dog, dog!' `His name is Bruin, sir,' said Biddy, following him. `Bruin, Bruin! Here, Bruin!' repeated Mr Tucker, soothingly; `come here, Bruin! Poor fellar, Bruin!' But Bruin wasn't to be coaxed, but stood in the middle of the street, eyeing Beal with a side-long, suspicious look, with his tail between his legs. `Call him, miss. He will be killed without a muzzle.' `Here, good Bruin, come to me,' said Biddy, kindly. But the dog knew better than to obey her, well knowing there was a conspiracy against him. Biddy advanced towards him, when he started off on a run, and disappeared round the first corner. She lingered, afraid he would get lost; but Beal promising to look after him, persuaded her to go without him. Following the freckled-faced urchin he had given her for a guide, Biddy soon found herself in Broadway. What with being bewildered by the noise and crowd, dazzled by the gorgeous display in the windows, stopping to look after brilliant ladies and dandies, and gazing at all the odd sorts of persons she at length arrived at Barton's door, hardly knowing whether she had her right and proper senses or not. `That's the number, young miss,' said the boy, in a voice as hoarse as a penny-paper crier; `I know'd the figur's soon as I seed 'm! You got a shillin', miss?' `No, good boy,' said Biddy, embarrassed by his abrupt demand. `But Mr Tucker will pay you.' `Tucker's a flummucks! Tip us a sixpenny then, Miss, and no blarney.' `I haven't any money, my good boy, I'm very sorry.' `Sorry killed a sorrel cow! If I'd a know'd you hadn't any shiners, I'm blow'd if old Jew Tucker'd got me to come way here. If you're goin' to live here, I'll keep my eye on you, and when you get flush, I'll make you pony up.' With this the boy went to see what he could get out of Beal. This little incident added to her confusion, and she stood some time to recover her self-possession. Besides, it was a great event for her to `go to a situation,' and she wished to appear before the lady with composure. At length she knocked on the door with her knuckles. After waiting, and hearing no one, she repeated the knock still louder. She waited again in vain, and began to think the people were all away from home, when a brisk little dentist passing on the other side of the street, seeing her stand knocking, crossed over, and said with a bow— `If Miss will pull the bell, she will probably get in,' and suiting the action to the word, he gave the bell-knob the sharp pull that had made Mr Fitz Henry Barton exclaim in surprise, `What a dem loud ring!' `Is Mrs Fitz Henry at home, sir?' asked Biddy, respectfully, of the smart liveried Fred. `Mrs Fitz Henry Barton? oh, yes, quite at home, missus! Walk in! I'll show you up stairs! Biddy entered, and Fred was closing the door, when Bruin bolted through, and upset him on the broad of his back. `Gor A'mighty, what debble animal dat?' he cried, getting to his feet; `better kill de nigger an' done wid it! Dis your big dog, missus?' `Yes,' said Biddy, laughing merrily; `I can't keep him out. He's gone under the stairs; will you let him stay, good man, and I will send him off as soon as I can?' `He stay for me; I no touch de big dog— I fear de hydifroby. Come up stairs, if missus please!' Biddy suppressing the traces of laughter from her face, followed the valet up toward the library, from which, Mr Fitz Henry Barton, wondering at the musical laugh that he had heard, was about to come forth to ascertain the cause of it. On hearing them approach, he retreated from the door, and seated himself with a book in his arm-chair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART V. There be little sprites that keep true lovers in extremity.' John Bertyne. With a timid, hesitating step, Biddy passed through the door, which Frid held respectfully open for her, and which he instantly closed after her. She stood still a moment, struck with a we and astonishment at the magnificence of the library and every thing she beheld around her. To her unsophisticated, rustic mind she seemed to be suddenly transported into a fairy palace. At length, half affrighted at the splendor, she looked round to see if she could see Mrs. Fitz Henry. Mr. Fitz Henry Barton was seated in his arm-chair, wrapped in his gorgeous Chinese dressing gown, with a velvet cap ornamented with a gold tassel on his head; but being in the shade of the window curtain, he seemed to form a part of the combination of gorgeous objects that filled and constituted the library, and her glance did not, at the first survey, rest upon him; his eyes, however, instead of being fixed on the book before him, were banqueting on the sweet, mute loveliness that he had so unexpectedly become the possessor of. If Beal Tucker was struck at first sight with her beauty, Mr. Fitz Henry Barton was enraptured. Biddy advanced a step nearer.— He starts! He can scarcely believe his own eyes. Had he seen her before? Yes—it was the pretty hay-maker in her very person. How very beautiful she had become? What kind fortune had sent him such a treasure! What triumph he feels as he now thinks of his friend Morris! He sat fixed in an attitude of surprise, without the thought or power of speaking or moving. His senses were all resolved into vision. So profound was his astonishment and delight that he could not even give utterance to his usual exclamation, `demnition!' Biddy now saw that the Chinese wrapper, the brilliant dyes of which detained her eyes for one instant, encased the person of a young gentlemen, who gazed on her very earnestly and very rapturously. She blushed, and her timidity at the thought of soon being in the presence of her new mistress, was changed into beautifal confusion at seeing `her son' instead; for, she thought instantly, at discovering Mr. Fitz Henry Barton, that he must be that son of Mrs. Fitz Henry alluded to by the generous Intelligence office man. With this idea, she courtesied very modestly and approached him, `If you please, sir, is Mrs. Fttz Henry at home?' Barton distinctly recollected her spirited indignation at his conduct when her first met her, and did not wish to be recognized by her, lest all his plans should be defeated. As she spoke, therefore, he drew his cap down over his brows and placed on his nose a pair of gold spectacles that had laid on the table near him. He then looked up and said in a very courteous and deferential tone, `Ah, Mrs. Fitz Henry! a-a-no! But she will be in! Take a seat, Miss—there upon the ottchuman!' and rising, he offered his hand to conduct he, to the seat. `No, I thank you, sir,' said Biddy, withdrawing a step and diffidently taking the seat he had pointed her to on the ottoman. Mr. Fitz Henry Barton then stood still in trie middle of the floor and looked very much perplexed for a moment. There sat Biddy with her bundle on her knees and her eyes modestly cast down. He remembered her spirit, and he felt he had to proceed with caution and art. He was very much gratified to find she did not recognize him. But Mr. Fitz Henry Barton, seen in a meadow in the country in his fishing costume and a broad West India hat shading his features, and the same gentleman in his library, wrapped in his elegant dressing robe, with a rich cap on his head, looked like two very different persons, especially to such an unpractised eye as Biddy's There was, however, on the nether lip of the gentleman in the library the same little growth of hair that she had seen over the mouth of the one in the country; and as Biddy had never seen any body with a mustache before, except her father when his beard, as it often was, was a week old, this sign of manhood on Mr. Fitz Henry Barton's lip had made a deep and unpleasant impression upon Biddy's memory. Therefore, though she did not directly identify Mr. Barton with the young man who had attempted to kiss her, she felt that he belonged to the same genus. This reflection made her feel uneasy, and she sat with drooping eye-lids and a palpitating heart, waiting for Mrs. Fitz Henry. Barton stood looking at her with a puzzled and irresolute countenance. He knew what kind of a spirit he had to do with; he felt that he was more than matched. Nevertheless his vanity led him to believe (so long as she did not recognize him) that he might yet be triumphant. His passion and unbridled desires would not permit him to resign, without a trial, the possession of so much loveliness. At length, tired waiting and feeling anxious and intimidated by the novelty of her situation, Biddy raised her eyes, and they encountered those of the young gentleman. She instantly drew her veil over her features, for her instinctive delicacy felt itself wounded by his hold gaze. She now began to experieace certain undefined yet unpleasant sensations of she scarcely knew what—fear, suspicion, and mistrsut, at being left alone with such an impudent young man, even though he might be Mrs. Fitz Henry's son. The act of drawing her veil over her face, his ready mind, actively occupied in devising some way to approach her, seized upon as a point d'appui upon which to base his attack. With a light, foppish tread he advanced to the ottoman and said, in a tone of gallant badinage. while he gently lifted one corner of her veil, `Nay, pretty one, I beg you will not draw this curious veil over those charming features. I have not beheld such a demnition handsome ace this five years.' `I prefer wearing my veil,' said Biddy, holding it down and moving from him, and so unintentionally leaving place for him to sit beside her. `Nay, nay, my sweet rustic,' he said, seating himself by her side and taking her hand, which she instantly withdrew; `you are too beautiful to withhold yourself from the eyes of one so great an admirer of feminine charms as I am. Pray let me put your veil aside!' And he disengaged her hand with some degree of force and threw the veil up over the top of her hat. Biddy sprung from the ottoman, and would have fled towards the door but he caught her by the hand. `Nay, my pretty rural, I did not mean to offend you, 'pon honor,' he said, dropping on his knee and feigning a look of mortification and regret; `I thought you might indulge me with a little flirtation.' `I am not accustomed to such flirtations,' said Biddy with spirit, and not knowing whether she ought to be angry with her mistress' son. `Nothing more than a mere flirtation, I assure you,' he said; `you are from the country, I suppose, and don't know how they do things in the city. All the gearls here practice flirtation like rehearsals before the play comes. Do be seated!' `No, sir, I prefer standing. Will your mother be in soon, sir?' she asked trembling with fear and misgiving. `My mother? Oh, yes—my mother! yes I—I have a mother!' `So Mr. Tucker told me sir—a dress-maker.' `My mother a dress-maker. Demnition!' added the aristocratic and long descended Mr. Fitz Henry Barton, speaking to himself; `does she think I am a dress-maker's son? Ah! I see into it! Beal has told her some tale to blind her! Oh—Yes—Msis, my mother is a —yes—she is—a—' `Dress-maker,' said Biddy artlessly. `Yes—yes—a dress-maker! Demnition.' `Will she be in soon!' `Oh, yes—yes—quite soon! Do sit down.' `I wish I could see her, sir,' said Biddy, earnestly, only intent on her object in view; `Mr. Tucker said he had spoken to her and she had agreed to engage me on trial.' `Oh, yes—all right! You had best sit down till she comes in.' `No; I do not like to be treated rudely,' said Biddy. `Rudely! pretty innocent! Why, you don't know much of life. I can kiss half the pretty gearls in New York; put my arm around their waists! tell them they are demnition angels, and all that sort o'thing, you know.' `No, I do not know, sir,' answered Biddy with spirit; `and I assure you if you think to take such freedoms with me if I live with your mother, I shall not allow it. `Demnition! Not even to look at your diamonds of eyes, my pretty rural!' Biddy could not help smiling at the seriousness with which he spoke, and therefore Mr. Fitz Henry Barton took courage and went nearer to her. She retreated, still smiling, yet with a resolution in her fine dark eyes that promised to prove to him of a stranger temper than the smile. He saw, however, only the smile, and thinking himself invited by it, advanced and suddenly seized her around the waist. This act, precisely similar to that he had perpetrated before when Morris rescued her, would have betrayed to her who he was, even without the further evidence she instantly had before her eyes in seeing his cap fall off and beholding him bare-headed, as she had seen him in the meadow, where his hat fell in a similar attempt. Before he could ravish the kiss he attempted to take she disengaged herself and fled to the door. It was shut by a self-acting bolt, and could be opened only from within by a pass-key. She made one or two convulsive efforts to open it, when finding her escape barred, she flew past Barton and darted through a side door into his bed chamber. On seeing the nature of the place in which she had sought shelter she would have retreated when she discovered a door on the farther side, for which she sprung. She flung it open with a glad cry and found herself in a bath room. We will now return to Edward Morris who, it will be remembered, went to Charleston a day or two after his apple-tree trysting with lovely hay-maker, whose beauty, innocence, and naturalness had then well nigh drawn him into a declaration of love. The arguments he made use of to protect his heart from being further involved being based upon their different conditions in life will also be remembered. It was, therefore, with the determination to forget the rustic beauty whose loveliness had so seriously impressed his heart that he accompanied his aunt on her southern excursion. But absence did not conquer love! He found his thoughts constantly reverting to the meadow and the old apple tree, where he had spent such a blissful hour with the pretty hay-maker. He was strangely absent and thoughtful amid all the gayeties of that refined city, and insensible to the fascinations of the lovely and gay girls who sought his admiration. Often he was rallied on having his heart in New York, and he could not but confess to himself that he had left it in West Chester. He found himself penning sonnets to rural maidens, and writing verses on rural life. Love grows with what it feeds upon; and his scarcely confirmed love for the pretty hay-maker having his thoughts for food, thrived amazingly. At length he began to look forward with impatience for his aunt's return, and seeing his anxiety to hasten back she shortened the period of her stay and prepared to leave. A letter which he received the day he was to sail, in some degree relieved certain misgivings he had for some time felt of his pretty hay-maker's safety. It did not, however, cause him to delay his departure for home any longer. The letter was as follows: `New York, July, 1838. Dear Ned: What a demnition time you are staying out South. What you can find to keep you there this dem hot weather one hour after your aunt's business is done for, unless some pretty pearl, I'm dem'd if I can tell! Every thing goes on just as ever. I had a glorious drive last Friday on the avenue with Bob-tailed Brown, harnessed single in my green buggy. Tom Weston had a new team out, a dem'd handsome thing altogether, and came behind me like a streak of lightning. But I touched Bob and left Tom half a mile in the rear as I drew rein at the Harlem tavern. Dem'd good that, wasn't it! I run over a sow and a litter of nine pigs. Did'nt the young 'uns scamper a few. I took off a goose's neck with my off wheel as neat as you could cut it with a knife. Tom swore Bob was the best bit o' horse flesh in New York. Saw a pretty gearl on the side-walk—looked like a rural—but I was too anxious to beat Tom Weston's mare to stop and ask her where she lived. Sunday went over to Hoboken and saw lots o' second quality class beauties, but couldn't do any thing in my way, as they always have some of those chaps with a bob coat, round slick hat with a narrow crape round it, their hair plaited down on each cheek, aad their bosoms open, and cuffs and shirt-wristbands turned back as if they were ready at any moment for a fight. I can't endure such vulgar people! though I don't mind a set-to, for I have the true science you know, Ned. Havn't been out of town yet, but I believe I shall go to Saratoga next month. Saratogo is getting to be low now that every shop-keeper that can command three dollars can go there.— These steamboats and railroads are getting to be great levellers, Ned. I think I must go to the White Sulphurs, they are the most exclusive. Low people can't afford to get there I saw your uncle last week in Broadway. He would have passed me without seeing me, but I stopped to ask him the name of the farmer on the farm next to his above on the creek where the rural lives. He told me it was Woodhull. If you don't come on soon I shall go down there and get up a little flirtation with her. I think she's too pretty to be suffered to grow there unnoticed like a sweet flower under a hedge. Well, I have no more to write. By the by, my friend M—ks has let his beard grow all over his chin and it looks dem'd fine. I think I shall follow his example. He is going to be confirmed at St. Thomas'. Religion is a nice thing for sick and old people, but it spoils life for your true blood! In haste yours, Fitz Henry Barton. P. S. Tom Weston's mare stumbled this afternoon and pitched Tom out on his head and killed him. How dem'd unlucky, for I meant to have another race with Tom, for a basket of `Star Brand.' The mare wasn't hurt! wasn't that demnition lucky? F. B.' The steamer Neptune in which Edward Morris and his aunt came passengers, landed at the pier at four o'clock the afternoon previous to Biddy's elopement. His aunt's carriage was in waiting, and putting her into it he let her proceed to her home in Bleecker street alone, while he took a hack to his stables where he kept his horses, that he might at once drive to his father's country seat.— Was this haste and anxiety to leave the city without seeing any of his friends owing to filial love? He had been absent from home two months, to be sure; but young gentlemen of Morris' age and experience are not apt to hurry back to the paternal roof with precisely such solicitude as he now evinced. There was a stronger and more tender attraction than his father that drew him! `Quick! my horses, Jim!' he cried, jumping from the hackney coach as it drew up at the stables in Crosby street. `Ah, your honor, and you're come back is it ye ar,' said Jim, the ostler, with a broad grin of welcome; `as' its the pretty bastes ye ll find in good ordther. They have been four weeks to grass and came in yesterday as your honor writ to boss, and by the same token I seed the lether.' `Well, well, hurry, Jim,' interrupted Morris; `I dare say that, an' twice over again, an' it'll be no lie at all at all,' said Jim, going to the stalls. `Is it one or the pair your honor 'll have?' `The pair. Put them in at once!' `It shall be done right to the fore, yer honor. Och? wont the darlints feel their kapeing! They'll kick the miles behind 'em like paving stones!' Morris smiled at Jim's encomiums upon his horses, and in a few minutes afterwards was seated in his buggy with the fawn colored lines in his hands. Jim now gave the last gentle rubbing down with the palm of his hand to the beautiful neck of the right horse, and stepping a pace aside from the line of the wheels, pronounced `all right.' Edward Morris did not wait for a second notice, but drawing lightly on the reins so that the horses could just feel the pressure, he spoke a word to them and they started off at a rapid and dashing pace. Turning down Bleecker street into the Bowery he soon crossed upon the avenue when he gave them rein. `Come, my noble fellows,' he said as they flew along the smooth course, `you must make up this afternoon for your long idleness. Trot! you know the road, I see, and are as glad as I am to be on it once more.' Away they flew with their impatient master; and just as the sun was setting, two and a half hours after leaving his stable, Edward drew rein at the gate of the avenue that led to his father's house. His own footman, who had seen him descending a hill a mile distant on the high-way, threw open the gate, and the next instant he alighted from his buggy at the door of his paternal home. `My son!' exclaimed the old gentleman, hastening to meet him and glancing inquiringly at the reeking horses, `welcome, indeed! but what has happened? Your aunt, I hope— `All well, father. Aunt is at home in Bleecker street.' `Well, I am glad to see you, my dear boy. You look finely—but how the devil you do drive!' And the old merchant looked again at the steeds whose breasts and nostrils were white with foam, and shook his head. `They have not been driven for some time, sir,' said Edward, smiling at the secret cause of his haste, which his father could not divine and which indeed he would not frankly acknowledge to himself. `Perhaps so—perhaps so. John walk them about in their harness half an hour, and when you strip them rub them 'till they are dry, and then blanket them closely. If they catch cold Edward will lose them. Come in, my boy, and tell us all about Charleston.' Edward followed his kind father in, but ere he did so he glanced unconsciously in the direction of the Woodhull farm, and beckoned John to him. `John, has anything happened about here since I have been absent?' `Happened—no, sir.' `Anybody dead—that is, anybody married?' `No, sir, I believe not.' `No news then, John? How do the farmers about us get along?' `'Bont as usual, sir.' `Farmer Woodhull still lives up the meadow?' `Yes, sir.' `Sure there is no news, John.' `Yes, sir, quite sure. If there was I'd know it, as I've been here with the old gentleman almost ever since you left.' `Very well John. See that the horses are carefully groomed.' `Yes, sir,' said John, touching his hat as his master entered the house. Edward lingered over the tea table with as much patience as his impatience to get away would permit him to exercise. He related all that could interest his father in reference to his southern tour, and replied to the numerous questions he put to him without any outward signs of annoyance. At length, when the clock struck nine he managed to excuse himself with the plea of looking after his horses, a plea which the old gentleman very readily admitted. Edward, however, merely glanced into the stable and asked John how they were, and then continued past it to a narrow gate which led into a lane. It was a clear, starlight night, and, familiar with the road, he walked rapidly through the lane until be came to its extremity near the creek. Here he struck into a path beside the water, and following it for some time, at length came to the very place in the hedge over which he had sprung after Barton, on first seeing Biddy in the meadow. He again climbed over it and instinctively hastened onward until he reached the old apple-tree where he had parted from her. Here he stopped and took off his hat with a sort of tender reverence. `Yes, this is the well remembered spot!— Here is the old root on which we sat, side by side, her hand in mine! How often have my thoughts wandered back to this tree! How often have I lived over again in memory the happy hour I passed here with her—gentle, guileless, and so fair! Ah, me! I am in love and need no longer try to disguise it! My presence on this spot at this hour should be proof enough of it to my own mind. It is either evidence of love or of madness! I have ill kept my resolution not to see her again. Yet here I am, and I am confident I shall not go back `till I have an interview with her, if not too late at night! Perhaps she may care nothing for me—perhaps may have forgotten me! But my heart tells me differently. I could not think so much and tenderly of one wholly indifferent to me herself. What if she should have a rustic lover! I will go towards the farm house and see how things appear: I may possibly get a glimpse of her—perhaps have an opportunity of speaking to her.' With these lover like thoughts Edward crossed the meadow, and at length reached the yard enclosing the house. He noiselessty crossed the bars and entered a little path that led through a grove to the door. He passed out from the covert of the trees, and the humble house stood plain before him. All was dark! `They have gone to bed,' said he after surveying the unilluminated mansion; `I might have known if I had thought a moment of the habits of farmers. I wonder which is her room! Perhaps this low one with the rose-tree beside it—perhaps that in the attic. Whichever it be, heaven bless her, and angels watch over her innocenc eand beauty!' How happy Biddy would have been in her little attic could she have known, while its prisoner, that such a prayer, from such a heart, was breathed so near for her. How her heart would have bounded to know that she had one devoted lover, and he the youth whose image had occupied so much of her thoughts since she first beheld him, and which always formed a component of all her dreams of coming happiness! Little would she have thought of flying from home in the morning if she had known the handsome young fisherman was hovering around it. Edward gazed a long while at the house, walked all around it, and dwelt in imagina tion upon the loveliness of her who might be sleeping within its walls. `Yes,' he at length said fervently, `I will see her to-morrow, and if she is still worthy and will marry me, I'll make her my wife.' He turned to leave the spot, when Bruin, now first conscious of the presence of an intruder, sprung towards him with an angry growl. He started back and then spoke to him in a low but in an authoritative and fearless tone. The dog's menacing approach was instantly exchanged for one more friendly, and coming slowly up to him he scented round his feet and then stood still beside him. `Noble fellow,' said Morris, who had checked his fierceness by speaking to him in the tone in which he was accustomed to address his own dogs; `doubtless if you had speech you would relieve many a doubt for me.— Now, good night, sweet maiden!' he said, looking towards the house: `to-morrow I will see thee and thou shalt decide my destiny, for thou alone hast it in thy keeping.' With these words he turned and walked away towards home. Bruin trotted gravely at his side, as if to escort and see him quite off the premises. At the bars the sagacious dog stopped and watched him 'till he got quite out of sight across the meadow, and then turned and walked slowly back to the house, wondering, no doubt, what that stranger could have wanted about the farm house at that time of night. About four or five hours afterwards he saw Biddy herself appear with her bundle, when doubtless, his sober wonder was very much increased. His affection for her, however, led him to follow her away without making any remark about thesingularity of the circumstance. Edward safely reached home, and went to bed to dream of apple-trees and haymaking-girls in old straw hats. After breakfast the next morning, he sauntered along the creek and across the meadow, hoping he might fall in with Biddy. Although as our caption has it, `there be little sprites to aid lovers in extremity,' none came to Edward's in the shape of Biddy, and he finally came very near the farm-house without seeing any one. There seemed to be a good deal of bustle there, and two or three neighbors were outside the door talking loudly and earnestly with Mrs Woodhull and her two daughters, who stood in it. Approaching nearer with curiosity, he heard one of the woman say, `Sarved you just right, Mrs Woodhull! The way you've treated her has been a public shame to the neighborhood.' `Yes, indeed, it has,' echoed another one. `She was a lazy trollope, and as sassing as a lady,' said Mrs. Woodhull, lifting her voice in defence of herself. `She had city beaux, and thought herself above common folks,' said Miss Euphrosia `Yes, and I shouldn't wonder if she'd run off with one on 'em, jiss for your treatin' her so onnatural,' said the first speaker. `Biddy was a good gal, and every body liked her.' `Yes,' said another neighbor, `and for my part, I hopes, Mrs. Woodhull, she'll stay away 'till you can learn to act like a human mother towards her.' `She'll bring shame and disgrace on the family,' said Miss Euphrosia, weeping. `Your treatment to her has brought shame and disgrace on it already, miss,' said one of the neighbors, sharply. `Come, folks, let's go home, and not trouble ourselves no more about the matter! I'm glad she's gone! You may go to the other neighbors and hunt, as well as to our houses, but I reckon she's better looked out for herself than to let you lock her up again very soon, as David Woodhull says you did, all day yesterday, on bread and water.' `It's a lie,' shrieked Mrs. Woodhull after them, as they turned away. `Yes, father lies,' said the gentle Miss Euphrosia; `we didn't lock her up; and Biddy lies if she dare tell any body so?' `What seems to be the difficulty, good women,' said Edward, as the neighbors whose Sally's account of Biddy's flight, on going in search of her, had brought over to Mrs. Woodhull's house, were passing the place where he stood by the gate. `Why, it's Mrs. Woodhull, our neighbor, here, sir,' answered one of the most forward, `who has always treated her daughter, Biddy, a nice, pretty, and good girl as ever was, jist like a slave! And, yesterday, because somebody said how they saw, two months ago, a city young gentleman sit and talk with her under the old apple-tree in the meadow, when old David was asleep beneath it, what must she do but lock her up on bread and water.' `The infernal hag,' exclaimed Edward, with indignation. `I'm sorry to hear you swear, sir, but it is a pity to think how the poor thing has been treated by her mother and sisters! and jist because Biddy was so sweet and good natured and pretty—and they knew themselves to be so cross, sour and ugly.' `But what became of her good woman?' inquired Edward, with solicitous interest. `Well, you see, her mother locked her up in the attic there, yesterday morning, and made her work all day like a niggar, and fed her on bread and water; and she said she should be locked up so a week, `till she told who her handsome city bean was. Miss Sally confessed this much to me, just now.' `Did she tell?' asked Edward, coloring. `No, she wouldn't nor couldn't, nor I wouldn't if I could, if I'd been in Biddy's place,' said another of the women. `And is she there now, locked up?' asked Edward, making a step towards the house. `Lor' bless your soul, sir, no! That's what the fuss is all about. She took the hinges off the door as nice as you ever seen a smith do it, and'so comin' down stairs, got off this morning afore day!' `Where is she now?' he asked, with breathless interest. `Dear knows, sir! Her mother, shame to her, has been sending to the neighbors about for her, but I'm thinking she's gone down to York in the early stage. She know'd she could get places enough there, and good treatment at that, if 'twas among strangers. They say old Bruin is missing too.' `And this is all that is known, good woman;' asked he, anxiously. `Yes, and all I hope her mother and Miss `Phrosy'll ever know about her, 'till they repents their treatment on her. You seem to take it to heart, young man?' `No,no! I feel indignation at tyranny in any shape, particularly when the victim is the child of the tyrant, and, as you say young and virtuous. What time does the stage pass by on the road, mornings?' `Why, about five o'clock, or little earlier,' answered the woman, deliberating, after thinking a moment. `I thank you for your kindness, good woman; if you learn any thing from the young woman—Miss Biddy—I would be obliged to you to send word to Woodburn.' With these words, Edward hastened away, and rapidly took the path by the creek, towards his father's seat. `Woodburn!' repeated one of the women. `Why, that's Mr. Morris' place. I wonder if that can be his son that's been in Europe?' `I shouldn't wonder if he was,' answered the other two in the same breath. `What an interest he took in Biddy.' `Didn't he?' repeated the others. `I shouldn't wonder if he was the New-York beau Miss 'Phrosy talks about?' `I shouldn't wonder,' echoed the others; `he is a nice young man, but too high for Biddy to look up to in a honest way.' `I have known stranger things happen, though, in my day,' said one of the women. `So have I. There's no knowin' what may turn up, as I always says to my old man, Joshua.' `No, there's no knowin',' repeated the other two; and the three went on their way home, wondering at, and speculating upon the events of the morning. The intelligence Edward Morris had received, gave impulse and energy to his active spirit. Biddy had flown from persecution, and he had heard her innocence and worth borne witness to by those who had told him of her paternal bondage and of her flight. `How fortunate I arrived from Charleston as I did. How unfortunate I had not gone over earlier last evening?' he said to himself; `I would have rescued her with my life? She has fled, no one knows whither? It is now nine o'clock, and the stage has gone by four hours If she took it, she is in the city by this time. A stranger there, and so young and helpless! I pray that silly fellow, Barton, may not see and recognize her! Ah! may he not have had something to do with her flight! But no, that cannot be! She has escaped because she was imprisoned by her mother, and without motive or end. I heard something said about her getting some situation in town. Perhaps her necessity may compel her to accept of degrading service—perhaps too—but I will not talk—I will act! She must be found if she be living.' He was hastening along the path by the deep still water, when he spoke this, and he shuddered with the idea as he looked upon the dark flood, that she might possibly have thrown herself into it. But he could not harbor the thought of such a fearful voluntary end to youth and beauty like her's, and banishing it from his mind, he hastened onward until he reached his house. John was at the stables attending to his horses. He immediately called to him, and bade him put them at once to the buggy, and prepare to drive him to town. He entered the house to explain to his father the necessity there was of his suddenly returning to New-York, and that he might not be back that night. In a few minutes the horses were at the door, and John in his place, with the lines in his hands. Morris sprung in, and they set off at a pace that carried him soon out of hearing of the old gentleman's reiterated admonition, not to `drive too fast.' Once on the highway, Edward let the horses move at a rapid travelling trot, and in half an hour reached the village of Fordham. Drawing up suddenly at the little inn, he inquired, without alighting, what time the Chester stage had passed along. `About half pasth sax, yer honor,' said the ostler, spunging the horses' noses with a large spunge dipped in cool pump water. `Were there many passengers?' `Four, yer honor.' `Was one of them a young person' `Yes, yer, honor,' said Pat, washing a nostril, `a young gosson of a lad, wid his hat o'er his eyes, and he asleep at dat.' `No, no, a young woman.' `Och, now, and it's thrue for you! there was a young woman inside, an ould man!' `Confound the old man!' `Ay, and divil take him, too, if your honor says the word,' said Pat, with a hearty will. `What kind of a looking person was the young woman?' asked Morris, impatiently. `Och, wasn't she the darlin! She axed me with the swatest musical voice in the world, if I would'nt be so obleging as to be afther givin her a glass o'wather! An' whin I axed her if she would'nt prefar the drop o'whiskey in praferance, she smiled out of her two diamond black eyes, and spake from out her red lips to me, as if I'd been a gintleman, and she the Quane o' Ireland. `No, I thank you, sir,' and so, yer honor, I gave her the water, though I did'nt like to give the naked wather to such a nice jewel of a lady at all, at all! It's the illigant bastes yer honor's honor drives!' Edward, despairing of getting more accurate information from the ostler, threw him half a dollar and, dashed forward at full speed. Though not wholly convinced, from Pat's relation, that he was on the track of the fugitive, yet his hopes whispered to him that this person he described might be her; and with this idea, which grew stronger each moment, till it approached nearly to conviction in his own mind, he pursued his rapid way, on the road towards Harlem.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">`New York, July, 1838. Dear Ned: What a demnition time you are staying out South. What you can find to keep you there this dem hot weather one hour after your aunt's business is done for, unless some pretty pearl, I'm dem'd if I can tell! Every thing goes on just as ever. I had a glorious drive last Friday on the avenue with Bob-tailed Brown, harnessed single in my green buggy. Tom Weston had a new team out, a dem'd handsome thing altogether, and came behind me like a streak of lightning. But I touched Bob and left Tom half a mile in the rear as I drew rein at the Harlem tavern. Dem'd good that, wasn't it! I run over a sow and a litter of nine pigs. Did'nt the young 'uns scamper a few. I took off a goose's neck with my off wheel as neat as you could cut it with a knife. Tom swore Bob was the best bit o' horse flesh in New York. Saw a pretty gearl on the side-walk—looked like a rural—but I was too anxious to beat Tom Weston's mare to stop and ask her where she lived. Sunday went over to Hoboken and saw lots o' second quality class beauties, but couldn't do any thing in my way, as they always have some of those chaps with a bob coat, round slick hat with a narrow crape round it, their hair plaited down on each cheek, aad their bosoms open, and cuffs and shirt-wristbands turned back as if they were ready at any moment for a fight. I can't endure such vulgar people! though I don't mind a set-to, for I have the true science you know, Ned. Havn't been out of town yet, but I believe I shall go to Saratoga next month. Saratogo is getting to be low now that every shop-keeper that can command three dollars can go there.— These steamboats and railroads are getting to be great levellers, Ned. I think I must go to the White Sulphurs, they are the most exclusive. Low people can't afford to get there I saw your uncle last week in Broadway. He would have passed me without seeing me, but I stopped to ask him the name of the farmer on the farm next to his above on the creek where the rural lives. He told me it was Woodhull. If you don't come on soon I shall go down there and get up a little flirtation with her. I think she's too pretty to be suffered to grow there unnoticed like a sweet flower under a hedge.

Tom Weston's mare stumbled this afternoon and pitched Tom out on his head and killed him. How dem'd unlucky, for I meant to have another race with Tom, for a basket of `Star Brand.' The mare wasn't hurt! wasn't that demnition lucky? F. B.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART VI. Morris' blooded bays dashed along the turnpike towards Harlem, at a rate that soon brought him to the stage-inn door. The red headed Scotch estler, leaving a horse that he was rubbing down, sprung to their heads, while all the loafers that usually lounged in the bar and about the door, crowded up to see what had occasioned such a hurried arrival, and to gaze at the foaming animals. `Wull I gie them a cule sponging, sir?' asked Jamie; `it's a warm day for sic fat cattle to be on the road.' `No, no! I shall not stop,' said Edward with impatience, and looking angrily around upon the crowd of loaters who stood staring at him and his horses. `Were you here when the Chester stage came in, ostler?' he asked him in an under tone, `and did you notice a pretty young woman in it?' `I dinna aften tak notice o' bonny lassesi' stage coaches, gude frien,' said Jamie, affecting an indifferent tone. `What, now, would ye be willin' to gi'e a body for the information?' Morris could not help smiling at the Scotchman's shrewdness, and handed him a quarter of dollar. Jamie took `the siller' in his bonny palm, tried it between his teeth, inspected closely the stamp, and then, as if satisfied of its currency, deliberately took from his pocket the thumb of an old leather glove, and added it to a small store of coin which it contained. Then returning his treasure to the receptacle from which he had drawn it forth, he looked shrewdly yet coolly up into Edward's face, and said in his characteristic dry tone— `Sae, its a bonny lass yer'e speerin after, maister?' `Yes! did you notice one in the stage?' `Perhaps I did. Had she black een!' `Yes, very dark black eyes!' `Was she aboot saxteen or thereaway?' interrogated the deliberate Jamie. `Yes I want to know if she continued on with the stage, or got out here.' `Had the lassie a wee bundle wi' her?' `Yes—I dare say—yes;' at length replied Edward, with an impatience to which the philosophical Jamie was quite insensible. `Well, then, I believe that I did see the lass, mon! I mind her bonny black een, weel. She woulkn't alight, but sat quiet i' the coach `till Deck the coachmon changed the cattle. I mind her weel, man.' `Then she kept on to the city?' said Morris, making a sign to John to start forward. `As to hersel' keeyin' on to the ceety, I wunna just answer to aver to ye,' replied Jamie, stepping aside from the horses' heads, as he saw John was about to move, `but she left the inn, inside the coach, and doubtless kept her seat 'till she got to the toon.' Edward was twenty feet off as the last words reached his ears, and moving at the rate of twelve miles an hour towards town. Whoever has had the happiness to drive a pair of fast trotting horses on that delightful pleasure course, the Third Avenue, will easily form an idea of the fleetness with which our hero, having an object so important in view, was whirling over it towards the city. If his horses did not fling the miles behind them `like paving-stones, as his Irish ostler promised they would, they seemed to fly over them with winged hoofs! At length they approached the great city with its hundred graceful spires, towers and gothic turrets, and soon afterwards turned from the avenue into that great artery of the city, the thronged and noisy Bowery. It now, for the first time, occurred to Morris that he had, in his impatience to proceed, neglected to inquire at Harlem, where the West Chester stage put up. This he now felt was very important for him to know, and from that point his search for the lovely runaway was to commence. `John,' he said abruptly, as his servant guided the horses along the intricated and devious passages formed by the numerous vehicles moving in every direction. `Sir,' answered John, touching his hat with his whip hand. `Stop at the first stage office where I can inquire where the West Chester stage puts out its passengers.' `Oh, I can tell you that, sir,' said John, who, until they reached Fordham, had wondered what had caused his master to start so suddenly for town; and who, since he had learned his object by his inquiries, had been puzzled to learn why the moral and staid young Edward Morris should be thus openly engaged in pursuit of a young girl `with a bundle.' Morris, however, had not seen fit to make John his confidant, and so the valet continued in his mystification, though with a very natural curiosity to know in what his extraordinary pursuit was likely to terminate. `It's No. 21, Bowery, sir,' added John. `Then drive thither without delay,' said Morris, his mind very much relieved. What with the detentions caused by omnibusses and rail-cars, it seemed a long time to the impatient young lover before John at length drew up before a low, straw-colored wooden building, just below the theatre on the east side of the way, with `No. 21, Bowery,' painted in large letters on the front. An awning stretched over the sidewalk, and beneath it, round a door leading into a bar-room, sat several loungers and loafers, and idle stage-drivers. Edward's dashing equipage and fine horses instantly drew the attention of two or three of the latter, and they got up to look at it with professional admiration and curiosity. Without heeding them, Edward sprang out, and entered the low bar-room which was also used as a stage-office. Two or three women and an old farmer were seated there, waiting for stages. He glanced round upon them as he entered, as if he expected to see there the object of his pursuit; while instantly his thoughts revolted at the idea of finding her in such a place. A stout man, with a `mine host' like look, was writing on a scrap of paper at a little desk behind the bar. `Does the stage from West Chester County stop here, sir?' he asked of this functionary. The man neither lifted his eyes nor his pen, and replied mechanically, `Yes.' `Can you tell me, sir,' continued Edward, whose own ardor of feeling was chilled by this indifference to his solicitous inquiry, and he spoke now with a respectful deference, that he thought would draw a more civil reply from the absorbed agent or landlord. The man's ear was not insensible to the gentlemanly tone of his voice, and looked up, and seeing Morris, laid down his pen, and said with an apologetic smile— `Beg, pardon, sir, what did you wish!' `Can you tell me if a young person—that is, a young lady, came in the Chester stage this morning?' `Well, I cant, as I was to breakfast when Dick Sharwood got in; but I can see Dick, and let you know, sir.' `I'm sorry to put you to any trouble, sir.' `Oh, none at all, sir! Dick's just at the door. Ho, there, boys, is Chester Dick there.' he hallooed to those on the side-walk, looking at, and commenting upon Edward's horses. `What's that, Mister Corney?' officiously asked a ragged fellow with a watery eye, a round rubicund face, and one of those good-natured smiles one often sees on the features of those wrecked whole-soul'd fellows, who have been ruined by such `devilish good hearted chaps.' It was Tom Conklin, who had a heart like a baby, and would drink with any body that would kindly ask him. Tom had a sort of tenancy for life, of the bar-room by day, and a bed in the stable at night, through the summer months; but in winter, he sought the shelter of the almshouse. Tom was always about the door, and always contrived, when any one came in to drink, to say a civil word to him, tell him that `his pocket ha'kerchief was out, and the boys might pick it,' or that he might lose `that paper in his waist-coat pocket;' or he would see, or pretend to see a little flour or dust on the comer-in's coat behind, and offering to brush it off. So, as men who go to bars to drink, always prefer drinking with somebody than drinking alone; poor Tom Conklin got many an invitation between sunrise and sunset. Thus Tom got along with the drinking part of his living; and by keeping on good terms with the cooks of one or two taverns near by, he got a plate now and then, of cold meat and bread. Tom, however, was always obliging, and ready to do any service for any body that needed it! bring a pitcher of water for the bar, clean the `agents' boots; get the milk from the yelling milkman, and bring it to the maid in the door, and other such little matters. Sometimes he would hold a horse, or do some other service for a gentleman, and get money instead of rum. But Tom was one of those `whole souls,' and he bad a great deal rather have had a drink with, and from the one he served, than the money; for he loved social feeling, to which, alas, for poor Tom, he had become the pitiable victim! Tom had twenty thousand dollars left him at twenty-one, and what with his `social feelings' and dissipated associates, he had not a dollar left at twenty-five. So he became the poor creature that he now was. Poor Tom! poor devil! equally to be despised and pitied, would that thou wert alone in thy sad and degraded estate. `Vot's vanted, Mister Corney?' asked Tom, who, on seeing Edward enter the office, had followed him. `Can I do any thing for you, sir?' he added, touching his ragged beaver, and smiling insinuatingly. Edward glanced at him with an emotion of pain and commisseration, as he replied, `No, poor fellow.' `I am a poor fellow, that's a pos', mister,' said Tom, with his best-humored smile, `a d—n poor fellow. S'p'ose we take a drink, coz I likes your looks. I knows vot a gent'leman is, havin' been one myself, you see; but it's a d—n loafer I've got to be now. But happy go lucky! Vot'll you drink, master? `I never take any thing quite so early,' said Edward, with a smile of pity. `I don't keep no watch, now, and liquor is liquor at all sorts o'clock. I likes it vedever I can get it. Come, let's take a little som'at for old acquaintance.' `I don't recollect that I ever saw you before,' said Morris, staring. `That's nothin' here nor there. God put us all into this world strangers to one another, for us all to make each other's acquaintance. Come, Mr. Corney, hand down the `canter.' `Don't pester the gentleman, Tom. You know you can't pay if he would condescend to drink.' `Pay! Think I'd drink with a gen'leman and he'd let me pay?' The Gen'leman will not let me pay if I axes him to drink.' `Is Dick Sherwook out there, Tom?' asked the agent. `No, he's jiss gone home.' `Did you see the stage stop here?' `Yes. But now, Corney, if you want to pump me,' said Tom, humorously, `put some liquor into me first, or I'm d—d if the pump won't suck.' The bar-keeper laughingly poured him out a dram, which Tom took off after nodding and touching his hat to Morris, who, from a fixed principle which it is to be regretted did not more generally influence gentlemen in such cases, resolved not to pay for any thing for him to drink. Doubtless Tom thought him only half-souled, and the bar-keeper, avaricious, if not mean. `Well, that's good liquor. Yes, I seed Dick when he druv up to the curb-stone.' `Did all the passengers get out here?' asked Edward, eagerly. Tom squinted at him out of one corner of his eye as much as to say, `No go, young un. You don't come the catechism over Tom Conklin.' Edward very quickly understood him, and placed a douceur in his hand, that produced a magic effect upon Tom's aspect. `That's the right tongue-oil, master!' said Tom, sticking it in his mouth for want of a sound pocket: `Now fire away.' `Was there a young lady got out here!' `I seed a young vooman as vould ha' been a lady if as how she hadn't a bundle,' said Tom. `That is the one. Where did she go?' `I seed Dick tell a niggar to take her bundle, and show her some place she wanted to find.' `Did you learn what place:' `No, but I guess Dick could tell.' `And she went with the negro?' `Not cozactly with him, coz he went ahead and she behind,' replied Tom, with a gravity that made Morris smile notwithstanding his anxiety to discover his pretty hay-maker. `What direction did she take?' `Down Bowery.' `Where is this driver to be found sir,' inquired Edward of the bar-keeper. `At his house, I expect, but I don't know where it is.' `I knows, sir,' said Tom, `if the gentleman 'll follow me. It's number five, Bayard St. —a ricketty wooden house, with the up-stairs all tumbling down stairs, that would a been burned up long ago, if the fire had not been ashamed to be seen burnin' sich a hedifice.' `Thank you,' said Edward, leaving the bar room; and hastily crossing the side-walk, he sprung into his buggy, and bade John drive down to Bayard Street, which was the next corner. `There goes a rum un,' said one of the stage-drivers! `he thinks horseflesh is made o'ingy rubber and whalebone. I never see horses druv that devil-behind-catch-me way! It makes me mad to see good animals abused so, jist for a fellow with a strait coat and kid gloves!' `He's got som'at to drive for,' said Tom, making his appearance. `He's after a young vooman as is run avay, I reckon, and come to town in Dick's coach.' `I saw the girl, and a fine pretty one she was, too,' said another of the men; `and she was poor, too, I guess, for Dick gave a niggar a sixpence for showing her some place she was after.' `Them horses is worth all the young women in York,' said the first stage-driver; `I wouldn't drive 'em so for any on 'em, I'll be blest!' `Not even for Jane Bailey, Barney,' said Tom, winking round. Barney's red face looked more crimson still and he levelled a blow of his whip at Tom's head amid the laughter of his companions. But Tom dodged it from long practice, and it descended obliquely, with all its force, upon the shins of the rascally negro who had guided Biddy to the Intelligence office. He set up a yell of pain and danced round on the side-walk, for a few seconds, as if he had stepped in boiling water. `Keep it up, darkey! that's y'er sort! jump Jim Crow,' cried Tom, with delight, as much at his own escape as at the other's suffering and antics. `When you get tired, nig, come in and take a drink! D—n me if I'm ashamed to drink with a niggar who's prove so good a friend, if he is black! I'm no abolitionist though! Come along, Cuffee! I've got the brass! Here, Corney, go in and give us a dram? Hullo, boys, come along! I've got a quarter, and so let's have a treat all round! Hang the expense! What's money for, if it a'nt to spend. Come, boys, step up, and let Tom Conklin treat?' Scarcely one present declined the invitation to drink, and so Morris' generosity contributed to the inebriation of half a dozen, instead of one, as would have been its limit, had he paid for a drink for Tom, which he would have been as well satisfied with as with the quarter. But this does not affect the principle by which he was governed. In one instance, though the evil would have been less, he would have been morally culpable: in the other, though the evil was greater, he was blameless! Uprightness and integrity of principle and action, are always safest; the effects must be left to themselves. Passengers in the street, and neighbors from the opposite window, gazed with surprise and curiosity to see a handsome equipage, with a man in livery, draw up in Bayard Street, before No. 5, and a fashionable young gentleman alight, and survey, with some hesitation, the premises, previous to entering them. Tom's description of the old wooded cluster of houses was not exaggerated; and those who have seen them, will not think it surprizing Edward should pause. They were an old wooden row, black, and out of repair, with broken steps and windows, and inhabited, seemingly, by a dozen tenants. At No. 5, which was about the midst of the buildings, was a sort of stoop, over which hung a dirty sign, with a boot painted on it. `Is this the house of Mr. Sherwood, the stage-driver?' asked Edward of a woman, sitting with a child on her lap, in one of two doors which seemed equally to lay claim to No. 5. `No, yer honor,' she screamed; `it's number fave he lives, the nix' door up stair! Go right up them little steps on the stoop, yer honor, and thin ye'll see the stair right afore ye! Is't washin' doon ye want?' `No,' said Edward, and turned to obey her direction; but the stairs before him were so one-sided, that he hesitated to ascend them, and he knocked on the wainscot with his knuckles. A little girl, cleanly and neatly dressed, came to the head of the stairs, and he asked her if Mr. Sherwood lived there. `Yes, sir. Papa,' she called, `here's somebody come to see you.' `Ask him to come up,' answered the voice of honest Dick, as if his mouth was full of his breakfast; `tell 'em to mind and not break their necks on the stairs!' Edward thought the caution was very necessary, and carefully ascended to the landing, when, through an open door, he saw the stage-driver seated at his breakfast. He stopped in doubt, whether to advance or not, when Dick, turning round, and seeing him, instantly got up from the table, while his wife bustled about for a chair. `Oh, sir, I beg pardon; I thought it some of the boys from 21. Walk in, sir. It's a poor place for a gentleman to come into—but it's the best I can afford these hard times, sir. These railroads and steamboats destroy the poor coachman, sir! Please to sit down. Wife, dust the chair for the gentleman!' Edward entered the room, which was neat, and better furnished than the outward appearance of the house promised, and took a chair, which the tidy Mrs. Sherwood wiped out for him with her check apron. `I fear I am an intruder,' said Morris, `but I called to ask about a young woman, who came down from the country in the stage this morning.' Oh, yes! Wife and I was just this minute talking about her! Didn't I tell you, wife, how I thought after she left the stage, she was a respectable young person, as run away from her home—she was so pretty and lady-like! You know'd her, sir?' `Can you tell me any thing about her?' asked Morris eagerly. `Well, all I know, sir, is, that seeing as how she was alone, and a stranger like in the city and being so gentle and pleasant, I took a liking to her, and asked her where she wanted to go, and she said to some Intelligence office!' `Good Heaven! I may be too late!' exclaimed Edward with a sudden energy, that surprized them. `She is your relation, sir, perhaps,' ventured Sherwood. `No—but I feel an interest in her welfare.' `So would any body, I'm sure, sir.' `What Intelligence office did she go to?' `I can't tell that, as I couldn't go with her myself, as I would ha' liked to, she was sich a young and innocent thing, and so paid a nigger to show her one as she, poor thing, hadn't any money but a short shillin', which I wouldn't take from her. She paid me four ten cent-pieces, instead of half a dollar, but then I'll gladly make this up to the company, out o' my own pocket.' `You are very kind, sir,' said Morris, with grateful emotion. `She—that is, I—will yet remember your disinterested generosity. Can you give me no clue to find where she went.' `I can if I see that niggar, Jim Johnson, that went with her, and carried her bundle for her.' `Could you not find him sir? Think! I will amply reward your trouble.' `I don't want to be paid, sir; I'd do any thing for her I thought would benefit her. Sam is always loafin' about the stage office, sir, when he han't money: but just as sure as he gets a sixpence, he streaks it off to Fve Points to spree it out! I'll go up with you, sir, to Twenty-one, and see if he is about there. If I can find him, you can easily find out where she is!' `I am very sorry, sir, to interrupt your breakfast,' said Edward: `but if you will go up there with me, I will make it worth your while.' `I don't mind the trouble, sir, for I'd like to have the young woman found, and better taken care of than with her pretty face she can take care of herself, in this wicked city. Betty, wife, just put my breakfast to the fire; I'll be back in a quarter of an hour. Come, sir, I will go with you, and if Jim's to be found, I'll find him.' Morris thanked him for his readiness, while he felt grateful to him for the honest and kindhearted interest he took in the lovely fugitive, who, as he learned more and more of her trials, grew more and more dear to him. `John, you may drive back to No. 21,' he said, as he regained the street; `I will walk there with you, Mr. Sherwood.' When Dick saw the fine establishment in which our hero drove to his dwelling, and saw with a practiced eye the blood of the horses, he, insensibly to himself, showed more alacrity to serve him. Dick liked a good horse, and from the animal, always felt disposed to transfer his admiration to the owner `Sam Johnson, however, was not to be found about the stage office, nor in the precincts. He had left, Tom Conklin said, after his drink, and taken the direction towards Chatham Street. `He's gone to the Five Points, sir,' said Dick; `but if you was willing to go there, you might as well expect to find a fat horse in an omnibus, as find Sam, once he gets into them dark holes there.' `I would willingly drive there, and make the search,' said Morris, with a look of disappointment. `No, I'll tell you the best course to take,' said Dick, brightening up at the idea; `I know the niggar is too lazy to go far for an Intelligence office, if he could find one near: besides, I know he wa'n't long afore he came back to me for the sixpence I promised to give him, if he took the young woman safely to one. So I think the best way'll be to go to the nearest one, and so on, 'till you find the right one. This can be sooner done than finding the nigger.' `You are right, my good friend, said Morris. `I will do so.' `You'll find a directory in the office, sir,' said Dick, `and it'll show you the number and street of all the 'telligence offices. Look for them as is in the Chatham Street direction, for that's the course Jim took her. Perhaps she may have gone to the `benevolent office, in Broadway, near Canal.' In a few minutes, Edward had pencilled down in his pocket-book the number of a dozen offices, and returned to his buggy. `I thank you for your kindness,' he said to Sherwood, who stood patting the off horse on the neck; `do me the favor to accept this,' and he thrust a five dollar note into his hand. `No, I am obliged to you, sir,' said Dick, bluntly; `I never likes to be paid for doing any body sich a service as this; I'd rather you'd give me a good hearty shake o' the hand, if it's the same to you. `I'll do both,' said Edward, laughing, and grasping his hand. `Good bye! I'll not forget you, though, for all that.' Thus speaking, he got into his buggy, bade John drive first through Walker Street to the office founded by a benevolent society to assist, gratuitously, servants to situations.— On alighting before the door, which was thronged with persons of both sexes, who looked at him, as he entered the crowded room, anxiously, as if he might have come for one of themselves. An old, benevolent gentleman, with rough kind manners, presided at the little desk, like the patliarch of the varied throng. `Sir,' said Edward, `is there a young woman here by the name of Woodhull, who came to town in the morning stage?' `Woodhull?' said the old gentleman, looking round, and then lifting up his voice so as to reach into the farther of the two rooms into which his office was divided; `is there a young woman here by the name of Woodhull? What's her other name, sir!' `Biddy or Bridget,' answered Morris with embarrassment. `Bridget Woodhull, answer to your name?' added the old man. There was a deep silence provailed through the office, and Edward began to despair! There was, at least, fifty females, of all ages and varieties of appearance, seated on benches along the sides of both rooms; perhaps Biddy might be there, and afraid or ashamed to answer to her real name. `Shall I look through the office, sir?' he asked. `Oh, yes, to be sure! Take off your veils, and show your faces, all you that have honest ones,' said the old gentleman, smiling; `this person wants to see if any of you an't Bridget Woodhull. Edward walked through the rooms, and gave a hasty glance at each countenance, some of them smiling, some cross, others saucy, and others anxious and expecting, but he saw no one there that looked like the pretty hay-maker. `Should such a person call here,' he said to the director, `I would be obliged to you to send me word, and detain her. Here is my address.' `Certainly, Mr. Morris; I will do so. Are you a subscriber?' `Subsbriber?' `Yes, to the society. Every subscriber can have the choice of servants 'till they are suited for a whole year, without additional expense; and all warranted good and faithful domestics.' `Oh, yes, I understand you! but I don't wan't a servant just now.' `Oh, very well—if you take this Bridget, of course you'll subscribe?' `Certainly, sir, in that case,' said Morris, confused. `Good morning, sir.' `Good morning, Mr. Morris; I will look for her. Do you want her for a nurse, or chambermaid?' `Confound the old fellow,' exclaimed Morris, getting into his buggy, with a heightened cheek! `Am I really in love with, and in pursuit of a possible chambermaid! Well, I will not stop to think about it—for I feel afraid of reflection upon my present pursuit! I must fulfil my destiny, and since it is that this sweet hay-maker hath involved it in her's! See her—find her I must!' `Where shall I drive now, sir?' asked John, with a covert smile, which the sensitive young man instantly understood; he hesitated, colored, and then said sharply— `To the stables, and put up your horses; but be ready to leave town at any moment, I will walk the rest of the way I have to go.' With these words, Morris sprung to the ground, and John drove alone off in the direction of Crosby Street. `And am I really engaged in a pursuit that I am ashamed to confess to my valet?' he asked of himself, as his horses turned down Grand Street. I will persevere, however. If she be all my memory and dreams have made her, she is well worthy all my efforts to rescue her. She is lovely, spirited, and all innocence! I will not delay another moment, but seek her through every Intelligence office in town, but what I will find her!' With this generous determination he proceeded down Broadway to Walker Street, and stopped at a neat little office with No. 68 over the door. A young pleasant smiling man, of genteel appearance, stood at the desk, laughing and talking with a fine looking English girl, while three or four others were seated. Every eye was upon him, and the girls put on their best looks; while the one with whom the office-keeper had been conversing perhaps to while away the time, wreathed her face in her finest smile, to attract Edward's regard, as if she meant to get a place through the recommendation of her good looks. Edward, however, paid no attention to her; but slightly glancing round the office, and not seeing her whom he sought, turned and asked the gentleman at the desk, if she had been there. `No, there has been no such person here, sir,' said Mr. Scudderford, politely, and with a look as if trying to recollect. `I would thank you, if such a young woman should come, you would instantly send me word,' he said, giving his address to him. `I will certainly do so,' said the obliging proprietor, and Edward left the office. After visiting three other intelligence offices with equal success, he believed he should have to give up the present pursuit of her, and go in pursuit, with Dick Sherwood's assistance to recognize him, of the negro, Jim Johnson. While deliberating whether to take this step or not, he looked at his list, and found that there were but two more offices to be visited. One of these was in so obscure and disreputable a street, that although it was not far from where he then was, he thought impossible, and shuddered at the idea that she could have gone there; the other was in a more respecatble portion of the city. `It is possible,' he thought to himself, `that a negro who frequents the Five Points, would, from congenial taste, guide a person to this low place, rather than to the more respectable one. I will try there! Am I indeed in my senses? Am I Edward Morris in person—to be seeking through the purlieus of infamy for a girl, whom I have seen but twice, with the intention, if I find her, of making her my wife! I will suppress thought and act, and leave the issue to time, and the result of my research.' He now entered this street, disgusted with the filth and the squalid poverty and unkennelled vice of the occupants of its hundred cellars and miserable chambers. At length he saw, before him the flashy tenement of Beal Tucker, with the sign of Intelligence office, swinging above the door, the first sight of which, two hours before, had filled Biddy's thoughts with instant hopes of `places' So long had Morris been engaged in his indefatigable search, that it was already nearly two o'clock, when he finally came to this office. Beal Tucker had, but ten minutes before despatched Biddy from his room, up stairs, to Chamber Street, with her ragged, freckled, saucy little rascal of a guide. He had eaten his dinner, and already re-opening his shop, where, however, but two or three girls had appeared, who had not been there in the morning, and so did not hear him say he should not be open 'till two. But Beal had succeeded in his little business affair with Mr. Fitz Henry Barton, sooner, and more successfully than he had anticipated he should do before he left his office to call on that interesting young gentleman. He was now shut up in his latticed desk or `counting room,' as he dignified it, engaged, alternately, in thinking on his fifty dollars in esse, and anticipating his fifty, perhaps hundred and fifty, in posse. `Good day's job!' he said rubbing his hands together. `Ah, here's a customer. Not a family man, I see, by his looks. He don't want any women folks. Don't look as if he wanted a mistress, neither, he, he, he. Perhaps he wants a man servant! Sir, your most obedient! Fine day, sir!' he said as Morris entered the low room. `Yes,' said Morris, coldly and haughtily, at once taking a decided dislike to him. Beal wasn't much gratified by his manner, and his heart recipocated Morris' antipathy. The causes of impulsive dislike between strangers, a first sight, is a theme that deserves to enlist the ablest writer on metaphysicial philosophy. Swedenbourg, we believe, has accounted for every emotion and impulse of the human mind but this. Is it connected, remotely, with animal magnetism. Will Mr Dawes or Doctor Collier answer? There might have been some secret spring upon which the sympathies of their knowledge of Biddy—the one for evil, the other for good, met on common ground. But we stop, for we feel we are encroaching upon the mystic regions of transcendentalism obscurity. `Can you tell me?' asked Edward, with as much grace of speech as his dislike for Mr. Tucker would let him use, `if a young woman, calling herself Bridget Woodhull, has been here to-day, seeking a place!' Instantly Beal Tucker's keener faculties were set, for he felt he had a part to Edward's appearance, and the gravity pw which he made the inquiry, showed him that he was the young girl's friend, and would be, if he was not already, her honorable protector. Perhaps a cousin, or some poor distant relation, thought he. Perhaps a real young lady disguised! A hundred surmises ran through his active mind in the interval between Morris' question, and his reply; but his determination to conceal his knowledge of Biddy, remained firm as it had been instant in its formation. `Biddy Woodhull,' he repeated in a doubtful tone, looking round his office, and seeing that those present had not seen her when she was there, `let me see, I think there was some such person here yesterday.' `No, to-day. sir.' `Oh, to-day. Well, perhaps it was to-day! I'll look at my books and see:' And the cool and studied hypocrite turned over the leaves of his books of entries, and seemed to be thoughtfully humming down the list of names, at intervals repeating, `Biddy—Biddy!— Woodhull—Woodhull!' At length he stopped, making a place with his finger. `The name is Woodhull, you said, I believe?' Edward's heart was in his mouth! he believed he had now found her! Beal Tucker meant he should believe so! his looks, manners, and tone, as he put the question, were intended for deception! `Yes,' gasped Edward `Ah, then this can't be it! this is Woodford—Betty Woodford,' said Beal, with a quiet, malicious smile, as he shut the book which contained no such name as he had represented. He saw from Edward's change of countenance, how deep had been the disappointment to the hopes he had raised, and he felt very happy—for another's misery always was gratifying to Beal, especialy if he himself was in any way instrumental in producing it. His sagacious penetration gave him also a pretty correct clue to Morris' anxiety to find her! but his own impure nature led him to do injustice in his suspicions to the purity of Morris' intentions! Yet if Morris had offered him down two hundred dollars, to find Biddy, he would have betrayed Barton, and produced her, if he could have done so without implicating himself in the previous villanous transaction in which the two had been mutually engaged. Morris was turning to leave the office, when his eye glanced through the lattice upon a card carelessly laving upon the desk. On it he saw written, `Bridget Woodhull.' There were other words beneath, which he could not read at a glance. `By heaven, sir, there is the very name!' he cried, fixing upon Beal a look of angry suspicion. Beal Tucker had seen his eye fall on the name he had taken down, and instantly, though quietly took up the card, lest he should also read read the minutes below: viz. `West Chester County—aged about sixteen—very beautiful—with black eyes and hair—never in the city before, and never lived out! `Biddy Woodhull, I think it was. you asked me for, sir?' said Beal, coolly, tearing in pieces the card which he had forgotten to take with him to Barton. `Biddy and Bridget both are one and the same name,' answered Morris, warmly. `If you wish, then, for a Bridget Woodhull, why that is a different matter aliogether, sir! Gentlemen should be accurate when they inquire for dames!' Morris felt like knocking him down, but he restrained the impulse, knowing that he had to do with a elever villain, and that he could only effect his ultimate object by being calm. `Can you then tell me any thing about Bridget Woodhull, whose name you had taken down on that card?' he demanded. `Why there was a young woman who gave me the name you mention, to get her a place, some time this forenoon, but as she had no money, I did not enter her name in my books 'till she could bring money to pay me. My price, sir, is half a dollar in advance. So after sitting here awhile, she got up and went away.' Morris looked at Beal Tucker earnestly while he spoke, and his voice was even, and his face without any particularly marked expression of deceit, and as the story he told was plausible, he could not but give credit to it. He now became distressed at her probable fate. He then prepared to quit the office, but turned back to say he would give him ten dollars, if he could obtain any intelligence of her Beal smiled, for ten dollars was not one hundred. Morris then bade him good-day, and was going out, when a ragged little imp, who had been waiting on the doorstep for some time for Beal to get through with Morris, now came in impatient of his delay, and said in his coarse sancy manner— `I say, Beal Tucker, I have seen your young miss to Chamber street. I know'd the figurs soon as I seed 'em! Numb—' `Hu-s-s-sh!' said Beal, menacingly, and glancing at Morris, who was in the act of going out. `Sh! I'm hanged if I'll Sh!' said the boy impatiently. `I axed the girl to fork over a shillin' and the critter said she hadn't a red cent. Now fork over old 'un!' and the boy thrust his dirty paw through the slats of the desk. `If you don't hold your tongue, I'll give you nothing,' alarmed lest in some way Morris should discover the identity of the person the boy had guided, with Biddy Woodhull. Morris, however, saw in the boy's entrance and language, nothing that could lead him to suspect him in any way linked in the puzzling chain that intervened between him and her, and only glancing at the boy, he passed out, with a heart shrinking with disappointment, and without possessing any further probable clue to her discovery. He slowly took his way up the street, looking into every face he met, with faint and dreary hope of possibly seeing that he so ardently and passionately sought. `I won't take less than a shillin' ' said the boy, as Beal handed him a five cent piece' `Come, old Tucker, out with your dust!' `I'll kick you into the street if you ask me for more,' said Beal, between anger and avarice. `I guess you won't,' said the boy, decidedly. `Come pony up.' `Get out o' my office,' roared Beal, taking a rattan, and shaking it at the boy. `I say, Beal Tucker,' said the boy, not at all intimidated, `I know a thing or two,' and he put his thumb to his nose, and made a rapid and significant movement with the fingers of his open hand. `Know, what do you know, you young rascal?' asked Beal, his voice falling. `That gemman wan't in here for nothing, I guess,' answered the boy, mysteriously. `Here, my lad, here's a sixpense for you,' said Beal, coaxingly. `I doesn't take less than a quarter,' said the boy. `I axes the extra shillin' for being called a rascal. I always axes a shillin' for that.' `A quarter! you young scoundrel, I'll flog you.' `Well, if you won't pay me for the gal, I know who will; if he'd give you ten dollars to know where she is, he'd give it to me, I reckon. I heard all your talk afore I come in.' `Hush, boy!' said Beal becoming pale. `Look here! there's a quarter now—and two cents more to it. Take it and go. You don't think the young woman he was asking for, that one you showed into Chamber street, do you?' said Beal, trying to laugh. `I doesn't think it, but I knows it,' said the boy, stoutly. `I read her name on her pocket handkercher what her bundle I carried was tied up in.' `The devil you did. Well, well, I didn't want him to think it was the person, because I know'd he was mighty anxious to see her, and I knew he'd offer something. It was the ten dollars I was waiting for, Bob. I'll get it, you see, for I mean to send him word by and by, and I'll give you half.' `Oh, cricky!' said Bob, affecting to be highly pleased, `I take!' But he saw with the acute penetration characteristic of New York boys of his class, at the bottom of Beal's subterfuge at once. But wishing not to betray to Beal that he was too deep for him, he pretended that he was blinded, and pocketing the money he went out of the office whistling Jim-a-long-Josey. `The infernal rascal!' said Beal, as Bob went out of sight, `He like to have suspected and he then would have made a pretty mess of it! But I have galled him this time; lost a twenty-two cents by it, for I didn't mean to give the scamp more than five pence. I wonder what the devil this young man wanted with her? Not for the same purpose Barton does, I am sure, for he looks like a different sort of person. I should like his ten dollars; but never mind; Barton has feathered my nest soft enough for one day! Hush that jabber-jabber there, girl! don't you see I'm thinking?' And Beal Tucker resumed his thoughtful, scheming attitude, with his hand on his forehead and his elbow on his desk. Edward Morris took his way at a slow, uncertain pace along the street in which Beal Tucker's Intelligence office stood, towards Broadway. The more he reflected on the conduct of Beal, the more convinced he became that he knew more about Biddy than he revealed. But the plausibility of the story he told him, that she was without money, and he wouldn't get a place for her 'till she paid, recurred to his mind, and he became undecided and perplexed. He was just entering Broadway, his thoughts dwelling on the sad and hopeless subject, when he felt his sleeve pulled; looking round he saw and recognized the same little freckled face urchin that had entered the office and demanded a sixpence of Beal as he was coming out of it. `I say, mister, wan't you axing after a young 'ooman down to Beal Tucker's 'telligence office?' `Yes, my man,' replied Morris, with a kindling of hope. `Do you know anything about her?' `Don't be too quick, mister! What I knows I knows, and knows how to keep, too!' answered the boy with shrewd caution. Edward placed in his hand half a dollar, and at the same time asked eagerly, `Now tell me what you know about her?' `Wan't her name Biddy Woodhull?' asked or rather asserted the lad. `Yes; you know where she is to be found, by your looks and manners.' `So does Beal Tucker,' said the boy with a grin, `for all he nam'd you off with a cock and bull story.' `Did he lie to me, then,' asked Morris, with angry surprise. `Like an auctioneer! You don't know Beal Tucker I guess, mister.' `But the young woman?' `He knew all about her when you was there, pumpin' him! There's` something green in your eye, I reckon.' `There's nothing green in yours, or about you,' said Morris, laughing at the forwardness of a boy hardly eleven years of age. What motive could Mr. Tucker have in deceiving me?' `That's his own look out, not mine; you're too hard for me there. But vot'll you give me if I'll tell you where she is this blessed minute?' `Five dollars, if you will show me the house, so that I can see her.' `I'll show you the house, but as for seeing the young 'ooman, vy you'll have to use your own eyes, and not look to me for a pair. I just came from showing her where she is, where Beal Tucker told me to.' `Good heavens! and it was for this service that you came in and demanded a shilling as I was leaving?' exclaimed Edward with astonishment. `Yes, and I made him fork out a quarter and two red cents, coz I told him I know'd what you were a'ter and I'd call on you and make you pay for showin' the young 'ooman the way.' `Infamous villain! Show me instantly, my boy, where you left her, and I will give you five dollars,' said Edward, wondering why the Intelligence office keeper should so deceive him without any apparent motive for so doing. Edward, however, had got to come to the knowledge of one avenue of iniquitous guilt in New York, of the existence and practice of which he had not the remotest conception. His suspicions, therefore, in the present instance, though active, were wholly at fault. `Five dollars ain't enough, mister; give me what you promised Beal Tucker and it's done.' `Ten dollars; well, I will give it to you.— Conduct me at once, and you shall receive the money at the door.' `Half down is fair play,' said the boy, extending his hand. Morris placed a five dollar note in his hand and then impetiently motioned him to proceed. The boy looked sharply at the bill, as if he could decide by his instinctive sharpness whether it were a genuine note, and then apparently satisfied, he thrust it into some unknown region of his tattered garments, and darted up the street into Broadway. Morris followed him at a rapid pace along the iron fence of the Park until they came to Chambers street, down which the boy turned looking round to see if he was in the track. The sight of the street reminded him of his relative, Barton, and he hesitated lest he might possibly fall in with him, and he did not feel in any mood for being stopped by any of his acquaintances. He, however, followed the boy down the street twenty or thirty numbers, and as he approached Barton's rooms he drew his cap over his brows and walked at a quick step, that he might not be recognized. But judge of his surprise when the boy suddenly stopped at Barton's very door, and pointing, with a jerk of his chin, at the number, said— `Here's the place, mister. I'd know the figurs if I seed 'em in Jerusalem.' Morris was thunderstruck. He stood transfixed with surprise and incredulity. He looked steadily and inquiringly at the boy, in whose face was a sort of dogged certainty and assurance of there being no mistake, that convinced him there was none. `And did you leave that young woman here?' he asked in a deep, earnest and a severe tone that made the boy shrink from it and the gaze of his eyes. `Yes, I did, sir, and I seed her go in after I'd got to the head o' the street. She cooldn't find the bell knob, and a man going by ringed it for her.' `And she went in, you are sure?' `I seed her with my own eyes, to make sure she was going to live there, cos I meant to get that sixpence for carryin' her bundle out on her some day, when she got flush. There's a manty-maker lives there, Tucker said.' Morris was not a fool, though ignorant of the numerous ways and means of villany and vice. A moment's reflection, with the knowledge he possessed of Barton's character, gave him a full explanation of Beal Tucker's motive in deceiving him. `Yes,' he said to himself, `Barton has made her his victim. Boy, here is you pay,' he said giving him another note for five dollars; now go. The lad did not require to be told twice, and bounded off in the possession of greater riches than he had ever before been the honest possessor of. Morris looked again at the number lest he might have been mistaken. It was that of Barton's house. He knew it well, for he had often visited him, especially before Barton had become so dissipated. Indeed he had been so intimate as to hold a pass key, both to his outer door and to his library. Neither of these he had now with him. Once the idea struck him that possibly Barton had moved, and that a mantua-maker lived there. But a glance at the windows, showed him that Battons curlains still remained there. There was then, no error, Biddy was decoyed under the libertines roof. `Yes, I will rescne or avenge her!' he said, with determined energy, `Barton is a sconndrel! and he shall die by my hand if he has injured her!' His first thought was to ring the bell, but this he saw at once would defeat his purpose of surprise, even if it should be answered. He therefore sprung over the iron railing into the area, to force open the basement door. To his delight and surprise it was on the latch. Fred having been too anxious to avail himself of his permission to be absent to stop and secure it. Entering the lower passage he lightly and rapidly ascended the stairs. All was silent on the first floor, but he heard the quick, rapid movement of feet above him. He flew up the other stairs, and as he did so, heard a shrick, a crash, and then a fall, accompanied by a loud cry, in a man's voice, of mingled terror and pain! He sprung to the upper landing with fearful foreboding. The door of the library stood open torn from its lock. He bounded forward into the room and beheld a scene that filled him with amazement and terrific surprise. In the middle of the floor lay Barton prostrate on his back with a huge ban-dog holding him fiercely by the throat. He was pale as death, and struck with mortal fear. Near the bed-room door stood Biddy Woodhull, her hair dishevelled and her kerehief torn from her neck. Her attitude was one of mingled terror and gratitude. Her dark eyes were flashing with fire which streaming tears could not quench. Her virgin bosom heaved with quick and strong feeling; her whole beautiful person was eloquent and instinct with indignation and womanly emotion. How beautiful, how touchingly beautiful she looked at that moment. She instantly recognized him and uttered a cry of joy. He rushed forward and caught her in his arms, and then pressed her to his heart!' `Thank God you're safe!' he cried with mingled indignation and gratitute. `Yes, sir, said Biddy, whose full heart was gushing through her eyes, `I am safe. Bruin is my preserver. Oh! sir, heaven hath sent you here as I was wishing you?' `Wishing for me?' repeated Morris, with delight; then you have not forgotten me!' `Forgotten you?' she repeated with warmth, `Oh no, sir!' and her face was suffused with lovely confusion. Mr. Fitz Henry Barton, the while, lay on the floor upon his back, with Bruin's teeth fastened in the delicate bow of his neckcloth, much to the derangement of that exquisite part of his costume. When Biddy fled from him and found herself in the bathing room instead of in an avenue of escape, she turned back and encountered him in the chamber. He threw his arms around her. She struggled in vain, and uttered shriek on shriek. Appalled by her outcries, Barton released her, when she flew back into the library. He waited an instant to restore his courage and confirm himself in his purpose by a tumbler of brandy, and then seized her as she had raised the window and was springing out. She uttered a piercing cry of despair, when suddenly she heard it answered by Bruin's loud bark on the outside of the door. `Bruin! Bruin! Oh, Bruin!' she shrieked, with difficulty as he laid his hand firmly upon her mouth. The dog heard and answered by fierce whines, and at length dashed himself against the door with such strength that he forced it from its bolt and bounded at a leap into the midst of the room. With a furious bark he sprang at once at the astonished and horrified Barton's throat, who had Biddy in his arms bearing her from the library. He released her with a cry of terrible fear, and fell, dragged bodily to the floor by the huge mastiff. It was at this crisis that Edward Morris made his appearance. Biddy related all this to Edward in a few eloquent words. So soon as the prostrate roue could articulate, he cried in an imploring tone, `Oh, Morris! dear Morris! for the love of heaven take off the dog! He will suffocate me! he will! Oh, he will! I shall die of strangulation!' `Infamous scounnrel,' muttered Morris, looking down upon him with pity and contempt. `But, oh! I shall certainly die here! Do good Miss Biddy, call off the dog! Oh! oh! God—oh!' Morris, seeing that he was really in danger of being strangled by the revengeful animal, and that he could speak with great difficulty, and was rapidly turning black in the face, he asked Biddy to call him away from him. The dog instantly obeyed, and releasing his hold came and licked her hand with mute affection. Mr. Fitz Henry Barton got to his feet with difficulty and staggered to an ottoman. Morris looked at him a long time in stern silence. At length he turned to Biddy, in whose little heart indignation and terror had been displaced by gratitude and love. Was it indeed the noble young man whose image she had so long cherished in her heart in whose presence she now was. And did he really regard her with tenderness. His looks, ay, and manners, all told her the deep and tender interest he took in her. He looked at with the deep gaze of impassioned devotion into her dark eyes, and said, while he pressed her hand, `Sweet girl! this is a happy hour to me. I heard of your flight from home, and have been secking you all through the city. Heaven has directed me hither to protect you and to offer you my heart and fortnne. Say I am not indifferent to you!' `Oh, no, no! Indeed, sir, I have thought of you every day since I saw you,' said she, artlessly. `I think I care for nobody else in the world but you. Indeed, sir, I never was so happy in my life as I am now. I have wondered very much where you were, that you did not come to see me after that pleasrnt hour beneath the apple tree.' Edward's soul drank the words of her frank and ingenuous confession, and he felt that he was indeed loved. A few words, by way of summary, will close this tale. Morris took Biddy home to his father's that day, and told the old gentleman her history. He was deeply interested in it, and took a decided fancy to her. She remained there three days unknown to her family, and then Morris, after being satisfied of her pure attachment to him, sent her to Madam Canda's fashionable boarding school, under an assumed name, as he wished to keep all knowledge of her from her mother and sisters. At the end of two years, he took her to his father's house and made her his wife. Never lovelier bride stood beside an alter to pledge her troth to him of her virgin hearts's choice. This summer they have been to Saratoga and the Falls; and every where the lovely Mrs. Edward Morris has been the cynosure of all eyes. The cross mother and envious sisters heard that the beautiful young lady at Woodburn about to be married to its heir was Biddy. But they were not invited to the wedding, nor would Edward allow his wife to recognise any of the family except honest old David Woodhull, her father, who was at the wedding, in a new blue snit, presented by Morris as a bridal gift. A chapter might be written on the envy and mortification of Biddy's mother and Miss Euphrosia. Mr. Fitz Henry Barton left town the next day after his disgrace for the White Sulpher, and thence he went to Europe, from whence he has recently returned with his hair growing all over his face, after the Parisian fashion, and with a great antipathy to dogs, which he disrespectfully anathemizes as `demnition brutes.' Beal Tucker fled to Texas to avoid a prosecution with which Morris threatened him. Bruin, the faithful old ban-dog may be seen any day in summer lounging at gentlemanly leisure about the lawn and portico of Woodburn, or in winter taking his comfort on the hearth rug beside old Mr. Morris' foot-stool. One of Morris' first acts, after sending Biddy to Madame Canda's, was to call on honest Dick Sherwood, and offer him the tenancy of one of his farms near Fordham, rent free for five years. Dick, has therefore, left the road and taken to agriculture. He says he never knew `four short bits' turn out so well in the long run, and it is his favorite maxim, that a man never loses any thing by being generous. Tom Conklin was, until last week, still patronizing No. 21, Bowery, with his presence, and managing to keep just half and half through the day. But last week one of the committee of the Washington Temperance Union got wind of Tom, and took him up to the Temperance Hall. Tom was, therefore, suddenly seized with a love of temperance and signed his fist to the pledge. He has not drank a drop since, and after his month's probation is up he has the promise of being pro moted to drive a cab—he has fixed on No. 179 as it has four wheels, and he thinks looks more respectable. Jim Johnson is become second boot-black to Peter Kobash, boot black. No. Elebenteen, Jim Crow Alley. Freckled Bob made his ten dollars, the capital for a `root beer' speculation, and has made it so profitable that he intends removing from his present stand at the lamp-post opposite the Astor, into a snug shop corner of Centre and Duane, and increase his stock by confectionary, pies, and apple tarts. Thus having disposed of the several characters in our tale, after the approved method recommeneed by Mrs. Radcliffe, and adopted by the novelists, we beg leave to subscribe ourselves, the reader's very humble servant.</field>
