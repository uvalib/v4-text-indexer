      <field name="fulltext">Opinions of the Press. “The Quaker City.” Lippard's Newspaper. Published at 72 Chesnut St., Phila. $2 per year, or 20 copies for $20. Lippard's Quaker City is decidedly one of the most interesting papers received at this office. At every reception of that paper we cheerfully devote an hour or two to the perusal of its interesting contents. And we have reason to believe that we are not alone in our partiality for the “Quaker City.” But a very short time has elapsed since the commencement of its publication, and yet it already numbers some ten thousand subscribers. Lippard (he will not permit us to say Mr.) is a bold and fearless writer, ever ready to expose crime and vice alike, whether practiced by the lordling or the slave—under the sanctimonious garb of religion, or the more fashionable attire of the upstart and dandy. —Spirit of Democracy, Woodfield, Ohio. The editor is George Lippard, a man who has attended an exalted and enviable rank amongst our native writers, whose style is unique and attractive, and who comes nearer making words the embodiments rather than the substitutes of thoughts, than any man of his age. In his descriptive and narrative pieces, there is exhibited a graphic power of delineation rarely equalled and never excelled. Indeed, such is his sententious brevity of expression and his excellent selection of language, that he rather presents than describes. The image that he would depict is before you to the life — the thought that he would express is literally impersonated in language. No one can read his master-piece, “Washington and his Generals,” without experiencing the wizard influence of transcendant genius — the genius of George Lippard. — Eastern Sentinel, Paulding, Miss. “The Quaker City,” is the quaint title of a weekly paper published in Philadelphia, by Geo. Lippard &amp; Jos. Severns. Its success so far is beyond even the most sangnine anticipations of the publishers. It may seem incredible, but we have reason to know it is nevertheless true, that notwithstanding it has only reached the fifth issue, it already numbers among its readers, ten thousand good subscribers. We are pleased to note the fact, more particularly as we have an intimate acquaintance with both gentlemen. Mr. Lippard, the editor, is well known as the talented author of numerous standard works, much sought after; while the publisher, Mr. Severns, has a wide-spread popularity in the “Quaker City” for enterprise and ability in the publication of former public journals. — True American, trenton, New Jersey. “The Quaker City,” is the title of a new mammoth weekly recently started in Philadelphia, by George Lippard, the author of the celebrated “Legends of the Revolution.” It is devoted to literature, and the work of moral reform. It is conducted in the editor's own peculiar style, and is a very readable and entertaining paper.—Trumbull County Whig, Warren, Ohio. Lippard's new paper—the Quaker City, we think, from its originality, its entire unlikeness to any of the other literary papers, is destined to have a large circuation. Lippard takes hold of some abuses with a giant grasp, abuses that must be grappled with sooner or later, if we would not have our religion a mockery, and our humanity a bye-word; and we say success to any man who devotes himself with heart and soul to the work. Lippard has great advantages for this work, situated as he is where he can see the worst results of the abuses or evils to which we refer, and possessing as he does the powers of description necessary to depict the evils in their real colors.—The Northern Tribune, Bath, Maine. The Quaker City newspaper will, we think, create quite a sensation in the romance reading world. The sheet is nearly equal in size to our largest Weeklies — the type is beautiful, leaving a full, clear, and bold impression, such as delights at once the eye and the fancy. The engravings too are admirable; but above all, the reading matter (there are no advertisements in the paper) is entirely original — the articles all lively, piquant and interesting — possessing that ease and grace of style which genius alone can impart. The subscription price is but two dollars per annum — we say but, for its certainly very low.—Democrat, Columbus, Miss. We desire to shake a huge grip of friendship with this Editor, and bid him “God speed.” He has undertaken to do what he will accomplish, and what should be accomplished in the world of literature, science, and true religion. We shall watch the progress of his “Memoirs” with interest, as we have read his prologue in the first number. Horace Greeley — “slovenly Horace” — has made a stir in the halls of Congress, a stir in the pocket, but George Lippard with his Quaker City, will make a stir in other high places, or we cannot read through the shadow of his futurity — a stir in the heart.—Expounder, Marshall, Mich. We have received the first number of this large weekly, literary paper, emanating as its name implies, from Philadelphia, and place it upon our already crowded exchange list. We do so in the first place, because it is edited by George Lippard, and in the second place because we love the name — having been borne and raised in that respectable denomination from which it derives its significant title. We hope to receive the paper regularly, and what can be done shall be done to further its circulation in this portion of the far west. — Gazette, Davenport, Iowa. Edited by George Lippard, who is too well known to the reading public as a great literary writer to need any commendation from our pen. The first number is on our table, and it is no disparagement to any of the weeklies to say it is equal to any paper we know of.—Illinois Revielle, Bloomington, Illi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MEMOIRS OF A PREACHER. PART TWO. THE SEQUEL. CHAPTER FIRST. “SQUASHAHOGANY.” At this moment let us change the scene. Passing through the thick walls which divide the rooms of Brother Caleb's house, let us enter yonder large chamber, on the first floor, where the light of wax candles falls upon the faces of Brother Caleb and his midnight guests. After a while we will trace the fate of poor Ralph, whom we left hanging on the lattice, with the tin box under his arm. For the present our history calls us to the large chamber on the first floor — the chamber which is connected by folding doors, with the room described by Fanny, in her Magnetic Revelation. A single thought should be borne in mind, while you peruse the scene which follows. Do not blame us, if you discover that our description of the personal appearance of these thirty guests, is vague and sketch-like. We dare not paint their portraits at full length. We should be charged with the use of undue personalities. A hundred gentlemen in Third, in Chesnut, and in Market streets, would swear that these thirty guests, so lightly outlined, were intended as their own personal portraits. Lift the curtain then, and let us take a hasty glance at Brother Caleb and his guests. Brother Caleb sat at the head of the table, stark and grim in his blue coat and snow-white vest. One hand grasping a pen, rested upon a parchment, near an ink-stand. The other held a long necked glass, glittering with amber-colored wine. And Brother Caleb's protruding eyes, lighted with faint lustre, as he surveyed the faces of his midnight guests. Twenty or thirty persons were there, seated in black mahogany chairs, around a table, covered with a white cloth. And every hand grasped a glass, and near every glass — starting blackly from the white cloth — stood a long-necked bottle, which bore the magic words “Cordon Bleu.” The orgie drew near its close. The feast was over. The plates of massive gold glittered on the side-board in one corner, amid the broken fragments of the feast. That midnight festival, in which the guests ate, drank, and were merry, without the presence of a single servant, had now attained the period when lights become double, and walls go spinning round. “What do you think of this plan?” said Brother Caleb, and his eyes ran along the line of wax lights, which shone dimly upon the faces of his guests. “Capital,” said Dicky Bung, making a desperate effort to fill his glass. “Good, very good,” said the lean Quaker, trying to look steadily at the candle before him. “Excels everything of the kind,” said a prim citizen, with demure face and neatly curled hair — “The Grand Subterranean Squashahogany Copper Mining Company! Here's to the President, Caleb Goodleigh, Esquire, and here's to the thirty original stockholders!” And the very respectable gentleman emptied his glass, and arranged his shirt collar, which was very high and white and stiff. “It's good — good I say,” said a pompous gentleman with red whiskers, and scarlet face: “It'll go ahead o' Multicaulis!' Sooth to say, the corpulent gentleman was very drunk. He made a well-intentioned effort to pour out the candle, and drink from the silver candle-stick, and then, as if conscious that something was wrong, gazed sleepily about him with leaden eyes. And thus the midnight guests spoke out, one by one, or in chorus, concerning the Grand Subterranean Squashahogany Copper Mining Company, until it was the turn of the last person at the end of the table. That last person was a jocund dame, dressed in the heighth of fashion — with a kind of matronly coquetry about her — and with a small white hand, glittering with rings, which kept up a perpetual motion between her bottle and her glass. Her eyes grew brighter as she suffered the champagne to glide over her lips, but her voice was clear and sweet, and even as a bell. “What do you think of the plan, Mrs. North?” asked Brother Caleb, from the head of the table. “We have discussed it so long, that I am really sick of the subject. Our names are signed; that is sufficient. We will make money. What those who come into the company after us will make, is another question. By the bye, Mr. Goodleigh, I would like to resume that little argument with you, concerning a First Cause. Do you really believe in a First Cause? You remember the remark of Baron Holbach —” Mrs. North's white teeth smiled between her red lips, as the amber-colored liquor glided down her throat. Mrs. North was a widow, a lady of property, and a Philosopher. Some people were so queer as to believe in a God — as for her own part, she couldn't. Mrs. North was a learned woman. “I will not argue with you, my dear Madam, as to a First Cause,” said Brother Caleb, while his thin lips were agitated by a smile — “But you must not deny the existence of a Devil. Any one conversant with mankind (for your sake I will not add woman-kind) must believe in a Devil at all events. By the bye, where's Scissleby?” At this query a general clamor rose. The name of Scissleby was shouted by twenty voices at once. But no Scissleby appeared. “He was to puff our copper stock in his paper,” said Dicky Bung, with a hiccup — “And now he's cut us! It isn't the fair thing.” And twenty other voices said that it was not the fair thing. The prim gentleman, the lean Quaker, the rotund gentleman, and seventeen others. “Here I am,” said an unearthly voice from under the table — “What—do — you — want? Copy, always copy? I say, is the Steamer in?” Poor Scissleby! Prostrate beneath the table, his long limbs entangled somewhere under Bung's chair, his mind was roaming in the fairy world of the Daily Copper. Even amid the delirium of champagne he heard an imaginary “Devil” crying for copy: with his head swimming like a humming top, he still had sense enough to ask the oft-repeated question — Is the steamer in? “Good for Slinkum,” remarked Bung, as he spilled the contents of a glass over his blue scarf: “Make an item somebody for the Daily Copper. `Drunk, but still attentive to business. Who? Slinkum Scissleby.”' Scissleby groaned beneath the table. “What do you think of the plan, sir?” said Brother Caleb, turning to a portly gentleman by his side — “You are connected with the police department of this great city. Of course you have many opportunities of studying human nature. You can estimate the amount of interest which the mass of people will take in this scheme; you can measure the —” “Amount o' pop'lar gullability,” said the portly gentleman, whose red neckchief looked pale beside his scarlet face: “Why s-i-r-r, in the course o' ten years exper'ence, I have come to the conclusion that the Public is an animal remarkable for the size of its throat, and the magnitude of its swallow. Stands to reason, sir, that a Public as swallows our Poleese system, must have a throat like Mount Wesooveus in the polar regions, or my name ain't Stewel Pydgeon, Esquire, 'Special P. O.!” Stewel was slightly affected with the bottle; very slightly. In his sober moments his geography was not of the most accurate character: you might measure his phases of his inebriety by that word “Mount Vesuvius.” When quite sober he located it in the gulf of Mexico; slightly elevated he placed it in the Polar Regions; pretty far gone, and he spoke of it as a celebrated volcano somewhere in “Asia, or Rooshe-a.” “Here is the plan,” murmured Brother Caleb fixing his large blue eyes on the sheet of parchment: “And here are thirty names each signed opposite from fifty to a hundred shares. This will give us thirty thousand dollars to begin upon. We can commence working the mines with that. Can we friend?” The question was addressed to the prim Quaker gentleman. “Even so,” was the reply: “Twenty-seven of the present company will give thee their checks for a $1000 each, to-morrow morning.” “I'm to have a $1000 worth in it, as `Borer General' 'afore the 'Legislature,” interrupted Bung: “Stewel have the same for his services as “Puffer along the streets” in Fildelfy; and Slinkum, (now under the table,) ditto for his services in the Daily Copper. Mind that. Us three are on the free list.” “Next week” resumed the Quaker, “thee will buy the farm in New Jersey, where this copper ore is located?” “I am now in treaty for it,” replied Brother Caleb. “The ground once bought, we can issue Certificates of stock and —” “There are plenty of workmen, servant girls and such like, who will invest their little carnings in the `stock' of the grand Squashahogany Copper Mining Company. If the Company fails they will loose of course. If it succeeds, we gain. Capital always does.” “Really you are a philosopher,” smiled Brother Caleb — smiled all over his pyramidal face, from his square chin to his flat crown — “But there is no danger of failure. The ore yields ninety per cent. Should you like to see it?” A chorus of twenty voices, said Yes! and Brother Caleb rose from his seat. His tall lean form, attired in the blue coat and white vest, was strongly relieved by the dark mahogany of the folding doors at his back. His singular face, with its hollow cheeks and great blue eyes, protruding from their sockets, attracted even the drunken gaze of the midnight guests. For a moment he surveyed the company, who were gathered in that spacious and luxurious chamber. His thin lips were agitated by a peculiar smile. The dull surface of his blue eyes flashed with momentary light. “Indeed, my dear Goodleigh,” laughed Mrs. North from the end of the table: “A poetical mind would compare you at the present moment, to Milton's Satan surveying his dupes in Pandemonium” — the lady seemed to lose the thread of her thought, for without a moment's pause she continued; “Ar'nt they so very drunk.” Brother Caleb smiled pleasantly, uttered some colloquial compliment, and then exclaimed in a voice that reached every ear: “That specimen of the Squashahogany Copper ore is up-stairs. I will bring it to you. Excuse me for a single moment.” Twenty voices and more excused him, and Brother Caleb opened the folding doors and disappeared into the next room. “Copy! Steamer in,” cried Scissleby from beneath the table. No sooner had the door closed behind the tall form of Brother Caleb, than the thirty original stockholders of the Squashanogany Copper Mining Company commenced an irregular and whispering conversation, concerning their mysterious President. “Rich as Crœsus or Astor!” said the prim gentleman. “Where did he reside before he bought this house?” asked the Quaker. “A singular man,” exclaimed the peculiarly corpulent person near Mrs. North: “Has rich connections in Europe. Duke of Wellington his second cousin.” “Keeps good champagne,” was the emphatic remark of Bung. “Tell the foreman to send up proof of the leader,” groaned Scissleby under the table. “What does thee think of friend Goodleigh, friend Stewel?” asked the Quaker, looking across the table toward the Police Officer. But the Police Officer had disappeared. And as the champagne made the circuit of the table the talented Mrs. North commenced a general discussion upon some abstruse point in Baron Holbach's “System of Nature.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER SECOND. STEWEL AND CALEB. Stepping across the threshold, Brother Caleb closed the folding doors behind him, and approached a table on which a small lamp was burning. It was the large room, described in the revelations of the Entranced Girl. The lamp emitted but a faint light, and the apartment furnished with all the appointments of wealth and luxury, looked vast and cheerless as the dim ray, flickered amid its splendid gloom. As Brother Caleb extended his hand to grasp the lamp, his singular face was displayed in strong light and deep shadow. What was the nature of the thought which gave such a marked expression to his lips and eyes? “I will get the copper ore,” he soliloquized, “and they will bring me the gold dust.” “Mister Goodleigh, I'm a Poleese Officer,” said a voice, and a hand was laid on Brother Caleb's arm. You may well imagine that this voice, breaking abruptly from the dead stillness, startled even the firm nerves of Brother Caleb into a tremor. “Hey? what! what! You here?” he said, as he turned and saw the full-moon face of Stewel Pydgeon at his shoulder. “I'm a poleese offisser, I am,” said Stewel with emphasis: “Don't you remember something about a tin box?” Brother Caleb fairly started with surprise. “A tin box?” he echoed — and then recovering his composure, as his lean form was elevated with an air of dignity; “I am at a loss to understand your allusions, Mr. Pydgeon.” “Bah! Wasn't I present at the office of Is'rel Bonus when he drew up your Deed for this very house? An' did not you put the deed in a tin box with other valleyable papers. An' did not you say that you kept that box in a small room at the head of the stairs?” “W-e-l-l!” ejaculated Brother Caleb. “You have an astonishing memory, Mr. Pydgeon — And what then?” Stewel inserted his thumbs in the arm-holes of his waistcoat: “Why, I'm a poleese offisser. I aint easily fooled. Now, to cut a long story short, do you remember a ragged devil, as came to pay his rent while you and old Bonus was in confab?” “I do not,” said Brother Caleb, opening his his eyes to the utmost tension of their lids. “S-i-r,” Stewel drew a step nearer, “That ragged devil was a burglar. An imported furrin burglar, commonly known as Persimmon Jake.” “A-h!” ejaculated Stewel, and the light slipped from his hand and fell upon the table. “Persimmon Jake and ten others planned the robbery of your house this very night. I'm a poleese offisser, Mr. Goodleigh, I am.” “And you have arrested the burglars?” said Brother Caleb eagerly. “No, s-i-r! Not so green as that! Want to ketch 'em in the act, I do. At this minnut, sir, there's ten burglars in your basement story —” “Ten burglars in my basement story!” “Two of 'em in the small room up stairs —” “What do you say?” — Caleb grasped the lamp, while his face betrayed violent agitation. “And there's ten of my 'special poleese in the next room. In the next room, awaitin' the signal to pounce upon the cracksmen.” “And who is it that will give the signal? Zounds, sir! this looks like a very stupid piece of work on your part —” “There's a closet in that room, a closet with a glass winder —” “Y-e-s —” “Suppose I was to buy over one of the burglars, and put him in the closet, and tell him to holler out the minnit his cronies laid hands on the box?” “Well? You have done this? Ah, I see your idea. Excellent, Mr. Pydgeon.” “And yit he called me stoopid!” exclaimed Stewel, with a proper sense of wounded merit —“Mr. Goodleigh, you'll jist please to take that light, and walk up stairs and see them cracksmen, or two of 'em at least, in the hands of the poleese. My poleese.” At once, Brother Caleb, light in hand, led the way from the room. In a second, he was passing along the wide entry, with Stewel following at his heels. Brother Caleb's face displayed considerable anxiety, while Stewel's was agitated by a succession of singular contortions. “You'll find your tin box as safe as a bug in a rug, and the thieves in the hands of my poleese.” Brother Caleb ascended the wide stairway 2 without a word. At the head of the stairway was the passage leading to the room, and at the commencement of the passage appeared the door of another room. “My poleese is here!” whispered Stewel. “Don't you hear 'em whisperin'? Push on!” Brother Caleb led the way along the passage, whose floor was covered with a thick carpet. In a moment, he stood at the door of the small chamber. It was closed. Stewel remarked that his hand trembled, as it enconntered the silver knob. “I hear no sound,” whispered Caleb—“all is still. Do you think your police have secured the thieves?” “Push open the door. In a minute all will be `self evident,' as Tom Jefferson remarks in one o' his epistolatory letters.” Brother Caleb opened the door, and his light flashed over the walls of the small chamber. At a glance the whole scene was revealed. The closet door was open; the lid of the desk was raised; the closet was vacant; the tin box had disappeared from its appropriate pigeon-hole. Stewel caught a glimpse of Brother Caleb's face. It was white as a shroud. The eyes rolled wildly in their sockets. `Ruined!” he ejaculated, “ruined, by —!” and would have fallen to the floor, had it not been for the extended arm of Stewel. “Keep a stiff upper lip, man,” suggested the police officer. “You forgit that my poleese is on hand. What'll you bet that they aint got the thieves and the tin box in yonder room?” “Go — on!” cried Brother Caleb, wildly waving his right hand: “Do not lose a minute! Quick! quick!” He pointed toward the door. Leaving him alone, Stewel left the small apartment, and hurried toward the room at the head of the stairs. The short time which elapsed during his absence seemed an age to Brother Caleb. “Ruined! ruined!” he ejaculated, his blue eyes flashing with a manic's glance; “Ah! This is some infernal plot! Where is Jervis all this while? Can he have anything to do with the disappearance of the tin box? Why does this Police Officer delay?” Stewel crossed the threshold as the last word fell from his lips. Stewel's visage was per fectly blank. He approached Brother Caleb without speaking, his hands in his pockets and and his nether lip between his teeth. There was a singular vacancy in his glance; he looked very much like a man who is just one minute too late for the steamboat. “Well, w-e-l-l!” gasped Caleb. “W-e-l—l!” echoed Stewel, in a prolonged tone, which terminated in a low whistle. “Speak! You are not dumb! Your officers — where are they?” “Sold,” responded Stewel, “Reg'larly sold. That's the sum total. My poleese aint there, Mister Goodleigh. Nor the thieves, nor the tin box. I'm reg'larly sold, I tell you.” “Scoundrel!” shouted Brother Caleb, making a dash at Stewel's red cravat: “What have you done? This is your plan to entrap the robbers, is it? Do you know that that tin box is worth more than life to me? By — I could brain you as willingly as I ever crushed a snake with the heel of my boot.” “Don't swear,” responded Stewel, cautiously retreating from the enraged man, as he put himself into a pugilistic attitude. “And don't lay hands on me. Tech me, and you tech the L-a-w! Could I help it, if my poleese did not come accordin' to 'p'intment? Th' amount o' th' thing is jest this. The thieves has been here. They have murdered the boy whom I placed in that closet. They have made off with the tin box. I tell you we're sold all round.” “And so you did not assure yourself of the presence of your police, at the time when you placed your spy in the closet?” exclaimed Goodleigh with suppressed rage. “Course not. 'Spose I'm green? Among my poleese was one or two o' th' cracksmen, who'd 'ave been sure to cut my throat if they suspected I was at the head o' th' business. You see the thieves hate me like p'ison.” “If I understand you right,” slowly remarked Brother Caleb, “your police came here in company with the two robbers, as robbers? This is a mysterious affair, Mr. Pydgeon. It may cost you your situation. Do you comprehend me?” This threat, made with due emphasis, did not seem to frighten Stewel quite out of his senses. “Can't say as I do. You wouldn't go to make a complaint to the City authorities? Gammon! Emphatically gam-mon! You want your tin box, I calc'late. Question is — how shill you git it?” These words seemed to have made an impression on Brother Caleb. Shaking in every gaunt limb with agitation, he passed his hand over his brow, and for a moment, seemed buried in thought. “Bring me that box before to-morrow night,” he said, raising his head, “and I will give all the money which it contains. The papers — private papers relating to my family — are all that I care about.” “How much money did you say was in the box?” “Fifteen thousand dollars, more or less.” Stewel started back as though he had been shot. “Fif-te-e-n thousand!” he echoed, and then relapsing into thought, muttered to himself — “Mister Charles Augustus Milliken, I do wonder where you air about this time!” “Speak, do you think you can recover the box?” asked Brother Caleb with great eagerness. “Who knows? There's no harm in tryin' —” “Hush! Do you hear that?” exclaimed Caleb, elevating his hand with a gesture of caution — “Voices in the entry yonder — footsteps too! H-u-s-h! The thieves are in the house yet.” The noise proceeded from the passage leading from the small chamber toward the wing of the mansion. It was now Stewel's turn to be surprised. This noise did not enter into his calculations. “Wonder what it can be?” he muttered — “It can't be young Milliken a-tryin' to get out o' th' house? He's had a half an hour and more already.” “What are you saying?” whispered Brother Caleb: “Do you hear that?” The sound of a key turning in the lock, broke harshly on the stillness. Shading the light with one hand, Brother Caleb motioned with the other to Stewel, and Stewel accordingly crept quietly behind Brother Caleb. The door was opened, and a beautiful girl, clad in a dark cloak, crossed the threshold. Her eyes flashed with spectral radiance from a face white as snow. By the hand she led a blindfolded man, who exclaimed as he crossed the threshold, and entered the small chamber — “Remember your promise! Don't harm me! I'll be quiet and obey.” You may imagine the surprise which dilated Brother Caleb's eyes, as he saw his friend, the Preacher, led blindfolded across the floor, by the hand of the very girl whom he had led from Church. Stewel, peeping over the shoulder of Brother Caleb, beheld the face of the girl, and cried with an oath — “A ghost, or my name's not Stewel Pydgeon!” Advancing with a hurried step, Caleb laid his hand on the Preacher's arm; the girl did not seem to behold him. Her eyes, dazzlingly bright, were fixed on vacancy. “Don't harm me,” whispered the Preacher, trembling all over: “You know your promise. At her request you spared my life. I'm to go with you, from the house, and to go out west, to Ellen's grave. Don't harm me.” “Why Jervis!” cried Brother Caleb. “What's this? A little melo-drama of your own getting up?” As he spoke, a form advanced from the background, a young man clad in a bearskin over-coat, with a fur cap drawn over his eyes. “Let us pass. This matter does not concern you,” said the young man, confronting Brother Caleb. And at the same moment, the young man's arms were pinioned from behind, and the voice of Stewel was heard, as his round face appeared over the young man's shoulder: “Got him, Goodleigh! The thief! Hurray for the tin-box. I say!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRD. THE BURGLAR AND THE GUESTS. “What! am I free?” cried the Preacher, tearing the bandage from his eyes, and at one glance surveying the face of the girl — the gloomy visage of Goodleigh — and the form of Charles Lester, pinioned by the arms of Stewel Pydgeon: `Yes, that's right. Seize him! A thief! a robber! He was about to murder me!” And in his delight the Preacher fairly danced over the carpet. Poor Fanny, still in the Magnetic state, stood like a statue, covered with a drooping cloak, her face glowing in the faint light. “Now, sir,” said Caleb, “will you have the goodness to name your accomplices, and to restore the tin box which you took from this desk?” “Where's your gang?” added Stewel. “A moment, and you would have been too late,” exclaimed the Preacher: “With this girl as his accomplice, he was about to lead me from this house to some haunt of robbery and murder.” “If it is not an imperlite quest'on,” said Stewel, who in a moment had seized Charles and pinioned his hands behind his back: “Which of you two brought the gal up stairs, the thief or the Preacher?” “The Preacher!” echoed that gentleman: “Sir, you are mistaken. I am no Preacher. My name is Jervis.” Charles Lester, with his hands pinioned behind his back, saw the tall form of Caleb Goodleigh glide between his eyes and the form of Fanny Jones. Charles was somewhat pale; his eyes however shone with unchanging lustre. “Will you release me, sir?” he said; “why am I pinioned like a thief?” “Down stairs with him,” said Goodleigh fiercely: “let us confront him with my guests. Perhaps some of them may know this burglar.” Brother Caleb held the light, while Stewel urged the captive from the room, along the passage, and down the stairway. Charles was perfectly still. He suffered them to lead and urge him at their pleasure. They entered the room adjoining the scene of the midnight festival. Charles was placed upon the sofa. Brother Caleb held the light near his face, and whispered — “Restore the tin box, and you are free! Hesitate, and I will proclaim you a burglar in the presence of my guests.” Ere Charles had time to reply, Stewel broke in with the words — “Where's the gal and the Preacher? Say? They'll be needed as witnesses.” Brother Caleb answered him with an oath. “Do not breathe a word about them before my guests,” he whispered: “they do not concern us, neither Jervis or the girl. Now sir,” turning once more to the captive, “your answer, if you please?” “Release me,” exclaimed Charles; “I know nothing of your tin box. Release me, and permit me to go my way.” The answer of Brother Caleb was soon given. Turning away, he flung open the folding doors, exclaiming, in loud and angry tones: “I have been robbed! Yes, my house has been entered by burglars. This way, gentlemen, this way, and tell me what you think of this fellow.” The folding doors were thrown open, and across the threshold thronged the thirty guests; that is, as many of them as were able to keep their feet. Some carried wax candles in their hands, as they surveyed the culprit, and the brow of the pinioned man was soon revealed in ruddy light. “Look at him, gentlemen,” cried Brother Caleb, who seemed beside himself with rage: “This fellow in the bearskin overcoat and fur cap, has entered my house at the head of a gang of burglars. He has robbed me of a tin box, containing the title deeds of all my property. Do you know him — examine his features — there!” He tore the fur cap away, and the face of Charles was disclosed. The young man, sitting on the sofa, his arms pinioned behind his back, and his visage, the object of the united gaze of some twenty-five pairs of half drunken eyes, seemed to have been seized with a leaden stupor. His face pale, his lips apart, he gazed around with large grey eyes, dilating with an apathetic stare. Indeed, the events of the past five minutes seemed to have completely deprived him of the powers of thought and sensation. Not a word passed his lips while he was subjected to this ignominious survey. “A bad face,” said the little fat man; “do you see that eye!” “Desperate villian!” said the large fat man; “looks like a pirate.” “Has thee pistols under thee overcoat?” politely asked the small Quaker: “If thee has, are they loaded? and if loaded, does thee intend to fire them off?” Here the buxom Mrs. North took up the story. Swelling through the crowd, like a billow of satin and velvet, she regarded the pale face of Charles through an eye-glass: “Rather an interesting face. Should not wonder if he had been a pirate. U-g-h! It quite makes one shudder.” Staggering through the throng, Slinkum Scissleby, lean and drunken, rested one hand upon the plump arm of Mrs. North, as he surveyed the visage of the culprit with a leaden stare: “Item for the Copper,” he muttered: “Melancholy effect of the perusal of French Novels. Young man caught robbin' a house — volume of Eugene Sue found in his pocket. W-h-a-t!” he ejaculated, as he bent nearer to the accused: “It's the same! I can swear to him! Threatened me to-night at the — Hotel, Room No. 92. What an escape I've had! —” with a profound sigh — “Yes, gentlemen, yes, Mrs. North, the Daily Copper this very night has been within an ace of losing its Sub. Steamer in, did you say?” Mrs. North quietly pushed Scissleby aside, for his inebriation had reached the Mezzotinto state, and he did not seem to know the difference between her hand and a roll of copy, as he pressed her plump fingers in his grasp. Bung came forward. Bung, with flushed face, curled hair, scarlet vest, blue cravat and plaid pantaloons. At a glance he recognized his friend of the evening party, in the person of Charles Lester. But with a truly Philadelphian instinct, Bung had no idea of acknowledging a friend in difficulty; he never knew a friend whose hands were tied behind his back. “A b-a-d face. Quite Jack Sheppard-ish. Send him to the Station House, Goodleigh, and let's have a look at that copper ore.” Caleb's lean form, arrayed in the spotless white vest and faultless azure coat, with yellow buttons, towered over the heads of all his guests, as he advanced once more and confronted his prisoner. The light which Bung held disclosed Caleb's face in strong relief. Ghastly at the best of times, it was now pale, repulsive, cadaverous. His blue eyes, bulging until they were on a line with the brow, and flashing with cold light over the hollows of his cheeks, gave a marked individuality to his countenance. “Stewel,” said Caleb, turning his head over his shoulder, and seeking with his glance the face of the Police officer; “Take him to the Station House.” Stewel waddled through the crowd “Come, my lark, you'll have to mosey,” he began — When the door was thrown open, and a stranger who puffed and blowed as with violent exercise, pushed through the crowd of guests, and stood face to face with the culprit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER FOURTH. “CAPTAIN BRADBURNE, OF THE FALCON.” “Lester!” he cried, panting for breath, as he lifted his broad-rimmed hat from his head, “I've found 'em, I've found 'em!” The stranger was below the middle stature — attired in a shabby frock coat buttoned to the neck — and his pallid face was surmounted by short brown hair streaked with silver. “Mr. Mervyn!” ejaculated Charles. “I've found 'em, I've found 'em,” continued the intruder, still panting and blowing: “You see I noticed you in the crowd at St. Simon's. Saw your eye fixed upon our friend (he named the Popular Preacher,) and therefore I concluded that I might find you at Brother Caleb's house, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour. — — puts up here, doesn't he, Brother Goodleigh?” “I do not know you, sir,” was the stern response — “Nor do I know this Preacher of whom you speak. Who are you?” “One of th' accomplices,” whispered Stewel, and his whisper was echoed by the thirty guests. The good Mr. Mervyn was abashed. Holding his hat in both hands, he exclaimed — “I never had an introduction to you, but as I saw you so frequently at St. Simon's, I —” “Found whom?” cried Charles, like one waking from a dream. “Harry and Annie!” and Mr. Mervyn turned suddenly and confronted the pinioned man: “What's this? Your hands bound? This is indeed extraordinary —' “Harry and Annie!” exclaimed Charles — and the words roused him from his stupor He started to his feet, bound as he was. His face flushed in an instant; he was in possession of all his powers once more. As he spoke, his voice firm and deep-toned, thrilled the spectators with involuntary respect — we do not say — fear. “Where have you discovered these children?” he said. Mr. Mervyn, who seemed half crazed with joy, replied as he panted for breath: “You remember what you told me to-night, at your room in the — Hotel? Well, that rested on my mind as I went home — followed me to church — I was haunted by the idea that I could identify the woman of your story, with some woman whom I had lately met, in a narrow court of this city.” “Profligate old man,” interrupted Scissleby, from his chair: “Met a woman — at his age. Reads French Novels. Steamer in?” “And going home from St. Simon's the truth burst upon me all at once. I turned back — went to your hotel — hunted you all over the city — and at last, by a lucky thought, called at this house. The door was open. I am here, and that's enough, but the idea which has been working in my brain all night, is out at last. The woman of your story,” his voice fell, and he whispered in the ear of Lester, “The woman Ann Clarke, is none other than Ann Jones of Bonus Court, where I live —” Lester did not suffer him to proceed: “And the children?” he said, his voice tremulous with agitation. “Are Ralph and Fanny Jones, otherwise called Harry and Annie Baldwin,” was the response of the Home Missionary. “Fanny Jones,” repeated Charles Lester, very slowly, but in an emphatic tone, as he felt the blood bound and grow chill by turns, from his heart to his finger ends: “Fanny Jones!” his eye with a lightning glare traversed the faces of the company. “The Preacher and the girl — where are they?” he shouted in a voice of thunder: “Caleb Goodleigh you must answer for this. Let but the finger of harm be laid upon her, and you shall answer with your blood.” The surprise of the guests, at these words, was equal in every respect to the wonder of the Home Missionary, when he surveyed the young man “in bonds.” Brother Caleb alone was calm and smiling. “Stewel,” he whispered — whispered in a tone audible to every ear: “Remove these persons, the robber and his accomplice, to the nearest Station House. In the morning I will appear against them.” Turning to his guests, he continned: “Come, my friends; let us withdraw into the front room. It grows late, and my nerves are somewhat ruffled. We had better postpone all further conversation about the `Squashahogany' until to-morrow.” The guests were turning away; Stewel laid his hand upon the arm of the Home Missionary, whispering, “Ain't you ashamed o' yourself, to go about robbin' in the name o' th' Clergy? You're the pious burglar, are you?” As for Charles, all the blood in his body seemed to mount at once, and in a torrent, to his head. He did not struggle with the cords which bound his hands, but grated his teeth, as he stood motionless with despair. “No way of escape! None — none! And Fanny is here, in this house, in the power of Ellen's murderer. To-morrow will release me, but to-morrow will be too late. Mr. Goodleigh — Mr. Goodleigh hear me — only for a moment, I beseech you.” But Mr. Goodleigh, already on the threshold of the front room, only replied by inviting his guests to follow him. “Leave the culprits in the hands of the Police,” he said: “This way my friends.” “Fanny in this house!” ejaculated Mervyn, who had been thunderstruck by the vague words of Lester. Charles again besought Brother Caleb to hear him — only for a moment — but Brother Caleb treated him with silent contempt. At this moment, a singular idea, which had been working slowly through the brain of the young man for hours, suddenly resolved itself into a distinct shape. Pinioned as he was, Charles Lester advanced a single step: “If Mr. Caleb Goodleigh will not hear me,” he said in a loud voice, “perchance Captain Bradburne of the Falcon, will grant me the favor of a private interview.” Why was it that Brother Caleb turned suddenly on his heel? Why was it that with a changed voice, and altered countenance, he besought the guests to excuse him for a moment? “Perhaps the fellow will confess,” he said smiling: “I don't want the trouble of a public trial. If he restores me this tin box, I will let him off. Walk this way, sir.” And Charles Lester, with his hands tied behind his back, walked through the throng, and passed into the first apartment. And Caleb Goodleigh closed the folding doors, and thus, was entirely alone with the burglar; engaged in a private and confidential interview with the man who had robbed him of his title-deeds. And the guests stood looking into each other's faces, as though a steam engine had exploded in the cellar beneath their feet. And Stewel Pydgeon, Esq., made various remarks to himself, to the effect, that he was struck stupid; his time was burnt; he was knocked into the middle of next week. Amid all this, poor Mr. Mervyn stood thunderstruck, pinching himself slyly to discover whether he was awake, or only dreaming. He made a trifling mistake in his confusion, and pinched Stewel, who looked at him with his large bulging eyes, as though he could have eaten him alive. “Well,” exclaimed Mrs. North, breaking the dead stillness. And the four-and-twenty guests (six were under the table in the front room, we believe,) also exclaimed “Well!” each one modulating the emphatic monosyllable to his own taste. Scissleby alone, swaying to and fro on his chair, asked in a tone of piteous entreaty — “What they meant by looking like stuck pigs? Was the steamer in?” Five minutes elapsed, while Brother Caleb and Charles Lester were closeted in close conversation in the front room. Five minutes were over at last, and the folding doors were thrown open. With one impulse the guests started forward. Brother Caleb appeared on the threshold, very pale, but with a smile upon his face. And Brother Caleb, by his right hand, held the hand of Charles Lester. Advancing into the back room, and leading the young man by the hand, he said in a distinct voice: “My friends I have made a very sad mistake. This young gentleman is the son of an old friend of mine, and I may add, of a very rich friend. He is incapable of a mean action. Mrs. North, allow me to make you acquainted with Mr. Charles Lester — gentlemen, Mr. Charles Lester.” The guests had not time to get fairly through one surprise, before another took their breath, and held them dumb. “Wait a few moments,” whispered Charles to the Home Missionary, and then turning to Brother Caleb, he uttered two very simple but emphatic words: “Now, sir.” Brother Caleb without a word took a silver candlestick from the hands of Bung, and passed through the door-way leading into the hall, followed by Charles Lester. “This way friend Charles,” he said, as he closed the door. The guests were alone once more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER FIFTH. THE GIRL AND THE PREACHER. Along the entry, and up the stairs, passed Brother Caleb, light in hand, followed by Charles Lester. “Remember your promise,” said Charles, “Produce the girl, or I will hold you answerable.” And as they stood at the door of the small chamber, in which, as you doubtless remember, stands the desk, Brother Caleb turned his face over his shoulder, and replied: “I only cultivated the acquaintance of this Preacher in order to throw a gloss of sanctity over my life,” he said with a laugh, in which there was also a tremor: “But we will find him and the girl in the Painted Room. Come on.” The Painted Room was the apartment beyond the curtain. “Find them, and we will talk about the Preacher afterward,” replied Charles, as they entered the small chamber. It was empty. The lid of the desk was still raised, and the closet door yet open. Brother Caleb uttered an oath as he beheld the desk by the light of his candle. “Do not delay,” whispered Charles; “move on, Captain Bradburne.” Brother Caleb led the way into the passage which, lighted by a single window and adorned by a statue, connected the wing of the mansion with the main edifice. At the extremity of this passage appeared the curtain which covered the entrance to the Painted Chamber. “Move on,” whispered Charles, “no time is to be lost.” In a moment they stood before the curtain; Charles listened with his ears and soul. All was still. “Go on,” he said fiercely: “I will not lose sight of you, until you bring me into the presence of the girl and the Preacher.” And, obedient as a school-boy at the command of his master, Brother Caleb parted the curtain and led the way into the Painted Chamber. There was a scowl upon his face, which he endeavored to cloak with a smile, as he held the candle above his head. “The Chamber is empty,” said Charles, in a tone of inexpressible despair. “They are gone. Whither? Answer me, Captain; you must know. How many rooms, with pictures such as these on the walls, have you in this pious haunt?” “There are four rooms on the third floor— two on the second, beside this; and then there is the garret,” answered Brother Caleb, casting his eyes to the floor. His face was very submissive, and yet there was a curl about his lip, very much like a sneer. “Lead me through every room, and without a moment's delay,” exclaimed Charles: “And mark you, at the slightest sign of treachery, I will take care of myself and of you, without a word.” He drew a pistol from the breast of his coat. Brother Caleb calmly arranged a button on his white vest. “Pshaw, Lester, there is no need of any thing like this, I am your friend. Why do I care for the Preacher? Only because there's such a vein of wickedness about him when he's half drunk. Come, Lester, I will aid you in every way in my power.” Brother Caleb smiled again and reached forth his hand, but Charles did not seem to remark the action. Certainly he did not take the proffered hand. He placed his own hand in the pocket of his overcoat, and did not for an instant, release his grasp of the pistol. “Go on, Captain, I'll follow.” They retraced their steps, and returned to the main building. Caleb leading and Charles following — of course — they traversed all the chambers on the second floor. Then ascended to the third floor. The light which Caleb held disclosed a range of apartments, furnished with every thing that wealth could buy, or a taste for luxury in its gaudiest extreme desire. We will not stain our page with a full description of all the secrets of that voluptuous haunt. Room after room was traversed. High ceilings, painted walls, beds of down, floors covered with `Wilton' carpet, flashed in the light at every turn. “You seem to live in fine style,” remarked Charles, as they entered the last room on the third floor. “It must take a vast deal of money — eh!” “When one is rich and a bachelor, one does not care for money,” was the answer of Brother Caleb. “Now, Lester, you must be satisfied. We have searched the whole house — every part, save the garret and the cellar. The Preacher has left the house, and taken the girl with him. Have I not complied with request of yours? Can I do more? Charles did not reply until after a long pause. Glancing around the chamber, furnished like all the others, in a style of extreme splendor, modified by taste, he discovered a small door, half hidden by a curtain which drooped from the ceiling. This door, unlike the one which communicated with the entry, was low and narrow, looking like an entrance to a closet. “Where does that door lead?” said Charles, closely surveying Caleb's visage as he awaited his reply. “To a closet sunken in the walls,” said Caleb quickly. “The old gentleman who owned this house a few months back, used that closet as the depository of his title deeds. He was a great man for real estate. Come — are you satisfied? Let us go below — my guests will become uneasy at my absence —” He moved toward the door of the chamber, but Charles gently laid a hand upon his arm: “Not so fast,” he whispered. “Caleb, I do not doubt your word, but I should like to examine the contents of that closet. This way if you please —” Brother Caleb's face was contracted with an expression of doubt and hesitation. He seemed to be very much engaged in brushing away an imaginary speck from the surface of his spot less vest. As he held the candle above his head, the light fell strong upon his forehead, revealing its marked outline, and giving a sinister glare to his protruding eyeballs. “There is nothing there,” he said — “At least nothing worthy of your attention. Come, Lester; return with me to my guests. They will begin to wonder and make remarks about my long continued absence. We have been engaged in this search for at least a half an hour —” “A half an hour, or a half a century, I care not,” answered Lester fiercely, and a scowl darkened over his face: “Give me the light. I will learn the contents of that closet before I quit this room.” Caleb with an air of deep mortification yielded the candlestick, and followed Charles toward the narrow door. “The key,” cried Lester, as he parted the curtains aside, and examined the surface of the door with a hurried glance. It consisted of a single panel, and was painted in imitation of the rich paper which covered the walls of the chamber. “There is no key. Press your thumb against the panel, in the right corner, near the top” — as Brother Caleb whispered these words, he stood behind Lester, who of course did not remark the expression of Brother Caleb's countenance. “We will examine your closet,” said Charles, smiling, as he obeyed the directions of Goodleigh: “Very likely we may discover something worthy of notice behind this mysterious panel.” The door yielded, and receded from its frame. Charles eagerly crossed the threshold, light in hand, anxious to explore the closet. The light for a moment streamed over Brother Caleb's face, through the narrow door, as he stood near the threshold, and then all was dark as midnight. The door had closed as suddenly and as soundlessly as it had yielded to the hand of Charles. Brother Caleb was alone in the darkness of the chamber.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER SIXTH. BROTHER CALEB'S TRIUMPH. “This trifling door is six inches thick,” he exclaimed with a laugh which resounded harshly through the stillness: “Four inches of iron, woven and welded together, and two inches wood. It opens and shuts by a spring. My Friend has discovered the spring which gives admittance to the closet — how long before he will discover the spring which gives him egress? A half an hour or a half a century — ho, ho, Charles, Charles, it is bad to play cards with Caleb Goodleigh when Caleb Goodleigh has all the trumps in his own hand.” With this philosophical remark Caleb left the Chamber, and familiar with the windings of his mansion, descended toward the first floor. “Ah, curses upon the stupidity of the Police Officer,” he muttered, as he reached the head of the first stairway, from which branched the passage leading to the wing of the main building — “Lester indeed is cared for. He cannot harm any one. But the tin box, the tin box, — I must rogain it at every hazard.” Descending the stairs he hurried along the entry, and in a moment, stood in the midst of his guests again. “Pardon friends, pardon this apparent neglect. But this Lester is a wild fellow — son of an old friend of mine — came into my house by mistake — a little affair of gallantry you understand. I took some pains to soothe his feelings, which, as you may suppose, were a little ruffled by the charge of burglary.” The guests were gathered in a circle around the buxom Mrs. North. They were whispering together in a low tone, and with every appearance of a confidential conversation, as Caleb Goodleigh entered the room. There was an universal start as the voice of Caleb resounded suddenly, drowning the low tones of the good lady, “La, Mr. Goodleigh, you quite take one's breath, with your melo-dramatic surprises,” said she with a mock-heroic gesture of terms — “But where did you leave the young man.” “Gone home — was a little ashamed of his lark — did not like to face this formidable company again. I saw him out of the first door a moment ago. Bless me, how late! After two o'clock, I vow!” This was all said in an off-hand conversational way, and at the last words he drew forth a massive gold watch from his vest pocket. The guests stood gazing at Goodleigh and 3 then into each other's faces, with a look of wonder that was quite grotesque. “Gone home,” said a voice from the sofa, and Mr. Mervyn, the Millerite Preacher, started up like a ghost —“Gone home did you say? And without a word for me? This is rather strange —” The good man looked up inquiringly into Caleb's face, as he stood holding his broad-rimmed hat in both hands “Ah, you here yet?” cried Brother Caleb with a good humored chuckle — “Mr. Tomkins I believe?” “Mervyn is my name.” “Mervyn — oh, yes I remember now. Said Lester at the door, `Tell Mervyn to call round at my hotel after dinner to-morrow.' If I do not mistake he has something of great importance to communicate. Will you bear his request in mind?” He laid his hand on Mr. Mervyn's shoulder in a friendly way, regarding him, at the same time, with a face that smiled in every feature. “I will certainly bear his request in mind,” said Mr. Mervyn, whose pallid face was undisturbed by a single shade of doubt — “Good evening gentlemen and —” ladies, he was about to say, but observing only Mrs. North, he concluded — “and lady.” He left the room. Brother Caleb kindly saw him to the door, observing as he was about to cross the threshold — “Keep an eye on Charles. He needs a friend — he does indeed, a friend like you — good night, my dear Mr. Mervyn.” Mr. Mervyn did not reply, but hurried down the marble steps without another word. This midnight supper party had not impressed him with the very highest notions of Brother Caleb's decorum or morality. When Goodleigh once more entered the scene of the festival, he found his guests in that peculiar stage of commotion, which indicates that the hour of retirement has arrived. Various parties of half-tipsy convivialists were hunting for hats and cloaks all along the room, under sofas, chairs, and tables. Bung was sternly endeavoring to bring Scissleby to his feet, if not to his senses. Mrs. North, all cloaked and muffled, had taken the arm of the fat man — the tallest of the fat men — who although very sleepy about the eyes, an nounced his intention of seeing her safe through the streets, even to the door of her residence. And Mr. Goodleigh, bowing and smiling, was so sorry to see them depart so early, and `hoped to have the pleasure of all their companies once more, at one of his little recherche bachelor suppers, before a week went over their heads.' “Steamer in?” interrupted Scissleby, as lean and very limp, in his melancholy inebriation he staggered to his feet. “What, the foreign news? Cotton easy — corn moderate — money tight — Queen Victoria in daily expectation of another —.” “By the bye where's Mr. Pydgeon?” exclaimed Brother Caleb, noticing the absence of that distinguished personage for the first time. “Said 'twas getten' rayther late,” answered Bung — “and the female Pydgeon and the five little Pydgeons would be uneasy if he staid away much longer. He went half an hour ago.” A sudden cloud came over Caleb's visage. “Gone?” he cried in a tone of impatience. “And I wished to see him very much before he left — in relation to the robbery too. Very provoking. Isn't it my dear Mrs. North?” But Mrs. North was already making her adieux, and Brother Caleb presently followed all his guests to the door, where he wished them “good night, good night!” until they were out of hearing. Bung and Scissleby, last of all, toiled down the marble steps, Scissleby leaning all his weight upon his friend, and asking incessantly for the Steamer while the Dry Goods Man with a crushed hat and an aching shoulder, heartly wished Scissleby, the steamer and the Daily Copper to the — dogs. “That farce is over any how,” was the remark of Brother Caleb, as he gazed from his doorway, down the wide street after the retreating forms of his guests. “How brightly the moon shines to-night! The street is almost as light as at noonday.” He closed the door, and was alone in that great mansion. His steps awoke no echo as he traversed the hall, and yet the very sound of his shoes upon the carpet impressed him with a sensation of loneliness akin to awe. He entered the room of the midnight supper. The candles were burning low; the plate on the sideboard glimmered with a faint dull lustre; the mirrors reflected the ungainly form of Brother Caleb, as he stood in the centre of the scene, his bright blue coat and white vest, only throwing his repulsive features into bolder relief. “I am alone,” he said, while his thick lips imparted in a smile: “There is no spy in the shape of a servant to listen at the keyholes of my house. No — no! On ship board and on shore it's a grand thing to be alone! These folks to-night, doubtless wondered at this splendid supper spread before them, without the presence of a single menial. Their surprise amused me. And yet it was very easy. While they were talking in the back room, the people of a neighboring Hotel, took care of the table, and arranged the champagne. Yes, — y-e-s! 'Tis a good thing to eat yourself into the good opinion of society.” Talking aloud — a habit acquired by persons who are much alone —he strode up and down the splendid rooms, while the candles were burning fast toward their sockets. “I have a large mansion, furnished in `exquisite style,' (as the auctioneers have it) — with gold plate — a cellar stored with the best wines — chambers adorned with rare pictures — blooded horses at a livery stable not far off — have all these, and plenty of funds, and am not so very old a man!” He surveyed his face in a mirror by the light of an expiring candle. “Better than all, there is no one to spy out my thoughts, or to listen to my half muttered words. If I want company, why I can buy the best with a good dinner. Do I want friends, they can be had for money. In fact, I consider myself as an individual remarkably comfortable and as well-to-do as any man in America.” He paused in his meditative walk. “Only two men can cross my path. The Preacher, but he is bound to me by the purest friendship. I feed him, and feed his appetites. This Lester — ah! wonder what he's thinking about just now?” Brother Caleb smiled. It was a peculiar smile, something between a grimace and a scowl. His wide mouth made a gash in his sunken cheeks — his eyes retreated within the protruding lids. “The tin box! The tin box! By Jove, it is curious! How slight a thing may change a man's fate! That box must be in my possession before to-morrow night, if it costs me the price of — this house.” Turning suddenly in his walk, he continued: “Where's the Preacher? What has become of the Girl?” These questions seemed to involve a great deal of reflection. For Brother Caleb, pacing the length of both rooms, hands behind his back, and head sunken on his breast, was silent for a long time. A newspaper spread open on a chair, at last attracted him from his reverie. He took it up, and at a glance, saw that it was the Daily Copper of the previous day. The first paragraph that caught his eye was headed “ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE.” Brother Caleb sank languidly in a chair, and perused the paragraph with great satisfaction, remarking to himself: “It is singular how many of these `mysterious disappearances' occur in this quiet City. A man with well filled pockets comes to Philadelphia, and is heard of no more. An item in the daily papers, is at once his obituary and his epitaph. How does he disappear? Where?” “Really this subject admits of infinite reflection — furnishes matter for hours of quiet musing. But it's late and I must get to bed.” Accordingly Brother Caleb laid down the paper and went leisurely up stairs to his bed chamber, in the second story of the splendid, but still desolate mansion. In the meantime, while he is sleeping soundly, let us ask, what has became of the Preacher and the Orphan Girl? Where is Charles Lester, who disappeared through the closet door in the third story? And Ralph — what has been the fate of this barefoot and half naked ruffian boy?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER SEVENTH. RALPH ONCE MORE. Once more we return to Ralph. We left him hanging in the air, one hand grasping the lattice, the other clutching the Tin Box against his side. It was a perilous moment. Ten feet at least were between the young ruffian and the pavement, the lattice was breaking in his grasp, a ruddy light streamed from the basement story and illumined the shadows of the yard. Ralph raised his grey eyes to the moonlight, muttering between his teeth, that all was lost, and then cast a glance beneath him. It was not a pleasant prospect. The light gleaming in a flood from the opened door of the basement story, showed the surface of the yard, one mass of ice and frozen snow, with here and there the dark face of a brick, by way of contrast. In a moment a world of hopes and fears flashed through his brain. Fanny, his dying mother, the Penitentiary, a scuffle with the robbers in the gloomy yard, terminating in a murder — thoughts which we express in these broken words, hurried through his brain like a flood through the unclosed lock of a canal. “Here's the last o' Jonesey,” he cried, and shut his eyes. He fell. Was he dashed against the pavement covered with ice and snow? Did he lay there, a stunned and death-like mass of wretchedness, clad in rags, insensible to the cold or to the clutch of angry hands? He shut his eyes and fell. For a moment all was dark, a sound like Fairmount Dam roared in his ears, and then — He unclosed his eyes, and found himself hanging in the air within a foot of the pavement. In his fall he had madly clutched the trunk of the vine. And now, as it swayed and and creaked with his weight, he held it firmly with the grasp of a drowning man, looking about him with bewildered eyes. The light from the basement door described a belt of brightness on the snow and ice beneath his feet. Voices, too, grumbling in half-suppressed tones, met his ear, but no face nor form appeared in the frame of the basement door. “Aint all over yit,” muttered Ralph, recovering his presence of mind: “Brass is trumps always, an' legs does when brass falls short. Fust for brass and then for legs.” He dropped upon the ice and snow. His blood boiling with excitement, he did not seem to feel the cold, and stood as firmly with his bare feet on the ice-covered bricks, as though he trod upon a floor covered with a double thickness of Wilton carpet. “This way,”—a hoarse low voice came through the basement door. Ralph did not pause to think, but made the best of his way toward the back of the yard. He saw the fence which separated it from the alley, glowing whitely in the moon. And then, turning the corner of the wing of the mansion, he saw the door which had given him entrance, and the marble steps coated with ice and snow. “This way, this way”— the voice grew louder. “Save your necks — the jig's up,” cried another voice. “They don't track me by the nails in my shoes, nor by my coat nayther,” said a third voice, and then there was the sound of a dozen pair of feet, trampling over ice and snow. Ralph, still girding the tin box to his side, glanced cautiously around the corner of the house, and with that glance commanded a full view of the narrow strip of yard which lay between him and the basement door. A crowd of men, dressed variously, but with their hats brought down upon their eyes, were hurrying from the basement door, up the steps which ascended to the level of the yard. The foremost of the band dashed a lantern against the wall. Ralph knew him by his tattered round-a-bout, and muttered between his teeth, “Blue-jay!” The second person stood for a moment in full moonlight, and, to the great surprise of Ralph, pulled off his overcoat spotted with great white buttons. “Stewel kin take his coat agin,”— Ralph heard the muttered exclamation. And then, still peeping round the corner, he saw the personage deliberately strip his boots from his feet. “You shan't swear to me by them boots, nayther, Stewel,” exclaimed Humming Bird — for it was he — “No doubt you meant it well, when you lent 'em to me, but it won't do, old boy.” But Ralph had not much time to spend in a longer survey of this scene. Scarcely had Humming Bird dashed the great coat and huge boots aside, (both worn over another coat and pair of boots) than Blue-jay pushed him forward over the snow, exclaiming — “Go it Bird! Now' your time to spread your wings.” They were rushing rapidly toward Ralph. Seized with a panic, believing that they had fallen into a trap prepared by Stewel, they were making the best of their way toward the gate. As Ralph stood at the corner of the house, half-way between the basement door and the gate, it must be plain to the most obtuse comprehension, that Ralph and his tin box will encounter the gaze of the fugitives, before another instant passes over his head. And Blue-jay and Humming Bird were followed by a crowd of other forms, dark, ragged, disguised in all sorts of caps, and hats, and cloaks, and overcoats. “Brass or legs? Which is it?” said Ralph to himself, clenching his right hand: “If I make a push for the gate they'll see me: if I stay here they'll be sure to maul me, and as for the tin box — O hokey! Won't they make a rush for it?” One glance toward the approaching thieves, one toward the gate which was at least ten yards off, and then Ralph clenching his hand, turned abruptly resolving to bury himself against the marble steps of the back door. At this moment his foot touched a dead body, which was extended stiffly on the snow, the blood oozing slowly from its severed throat. It was the dead body of a Newfoundland dog — a noble animal, whose black fur lay sleek and glossy, in the shadows, against the cold white snow. And right before the eyes of Ralph, rose a small structure, placed near the foot of the marble steps, and bearing over its gaping entrance the significant words — “BEWARE THE DOG.” To fling himself through the narrow entrance, into the residence of “the dead dog,” was the work of an instant. And crouching there, his knees touching his chin, and the tin box resting by his side, Ralph surveyed the yard, as a man in a light house might take observations along a line of rough and craggy coast. “This is the end of all o' Stewel's plans,” said a voice, well known to the ears of Ralph, and Blue-jay paused for a moment to contemplate the carcase of the dead animal. “He p'isens dogs, plants a nice leetle house breakin' and arter all gits a dozen o' us into a cussed trap. Oh Stewel Pydgeon!” And the voice of Humming Bird by his side echoed with a curse, “Oh Stewel Pydgeon!” Nor did the name of this respectable dignitary die on the air, with the last accent of Humming Bird. For ten other figures came round the corner of the house — stood between Ralph's eyes and the moonlight — and gazed from beneath their downdrawn hats and caps, upon the dead body of the Newfoundland dog. “Stewel Pydgeon!” they groaned in chorus. And Ralph shrinking within his rude retreat, beheld these distinguished faces and stout forms, clad in the very livery of vulgar theft, while the broken sentences of a low muttered conversation came distinctly to his ear. “Shill we go back?” whispered Blue-jay. “Stewel may mean the fair thing, arter all,” was the remark of Humming Bird. “Else why did he p'isen that ar' dog?” muttered a third. There was a pause — the gang of burglars seemed to battle with the panic which had impelled their flight — while Ralph, afraid to breathe, set his teeth together, and began to feel cold for the first time. A sound was heard, breaking horribly upon the stillness. Was it only the crash of an icicle falling from the roof, or the creak of an unclosing door? “They're comin',” shouted Blue-jay, “Stewel and his poleese! Run for it, every chap as wishes to save his bacon!” And away over the frozen snow they scampered, until their footsteps resounded from the back part of the yard. Ralph heard the gate creak on its hinges, and the noise of their footsteps echoed from the alley. Echoed, grew faint and fainter, and then died away. Once more all was the unbroken stillness of a clear, cold winter night, with a bright moon shining in a sky without a cloud. But Ralph still lay quiet and snug in his place of concealment. “When a-body's well off, a-body had better keep dark,” he muttered, and extending a hand felt the tin box, which lay in the straw by his side. For a long time Ralph lay there, listening with all his ears for the slightest echo of a sound. “One, two!” the bell of the old State House Clock rolled over the silent city. Like a tortoise peeping from its shell, Ralph stealthily projected his head from the entrance of the dog-house. The moon was shining down among the dark walls, revealing every nook and crevice of the yard. Not a sound disturbed the dead stillness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER EIGHTH. RALPH AND THE BOX. “Now for brass and then for legs,” he exclaimed, and taking up the tin box crept from the dog-house. Stealthily around the corner, Ralph; with bare feet crushing the frozen snow, toward the door of the basement, Ralph. It is the work of a moment, but the heart of the young outcast beats wildly. One glance toward the window from which you lately made your perilous descent; all is still above, and all is still around you. Your sister is there, above you, Ralph, but you do not know it. No, ragged savage, or else you would hurl the tin box to the ground, and mount to the window by the vine, and fight for the deliverance of your sister from Brother Caleb's house, against all the Stewels and all the Masked Preachers in the world. But stealthily over the frozen snow, Ralph, until you stand at the head of the basement steps. Sit you down there, Ralph, and quietly endue your chilled feet, with the comfortable boots, so carelessly thrown aside by the Humming Bird. It is done. Now the coat; a warm coat, Ralph, though somewhat large; a comfortable garment, though all too conspicuous, with its buttons of white bone, every one the size of a dollar. “Brass has done her duty, now legs must do theirs!” Boots on his feet, great coat on his back, and tin box under his arm, Ralph made the best of his way toward the gate, without once turning round his rude face, with shaggy hair, and large grey eyes. Arrived at the gate, which wide open seems to favor his retreat, Ralph stands still and hesitates — “Two ends to the alley,” he murmurs — “Wonder at which end the poleese is waitin'? Likely at both. Howsomever Jonesey my boy, there's no time to go back now. Now then for a long pull and a strong pull an' a pull all together, as they say on 'lection day!” He passed through the gate into the alley, and along the alley in a western direction, toward the next wide street, running from north to south. As he approached this street he took a firmer hold of the tin box, and endeavoured to suppress the sound of his heavy boots, which at every step sank in the ice and snow with a distinct crash. The street was reached—Ralph stood at the corner of the alley, and looked eagerly around him. The moon was shining brightly over the roofs of the lofty houses, and over the wide pavements, which were alike white and glittering with snow. But no one, not even the phantom of a police officer, was in sight. The street as far as Ralph could see and hear, was silent and deserted Whither should he direct his footsteps? Home to Bonus Court? Ralph shook his head. “The tin box and my idea-r won't allow that. It's my opinion that legs had better carry me out o' this 'ere town as quick as greased lightnin'.” He hurried northward without another word. Clad in the great coat which flapped and draggled about the heels of his cumbrous boots, being only three sizes too large for him, Ralph followed the street, until it crossed the Ridge Road. The Ridge Road, as every body ought to know, is an eccentric street. Instead of running north or south like any well-behaved Quaker City street, it worms and twists as though seeking for something which it had lost. Starting from Ninth and Vine, it winds and zig-zags away, until it becomes “a pike,” somewhere on the outskirts of the city. It is perfectly New York in all its features. Cutting sharp angles, shaving the corners of houses — it would be entirely alone in crookedness, were it not for Old York Road, Dock Street, and one or two others of these eccentric streets, which run pretty much as they please, not having the fear of `due north and south' or `due east and west' before their eyes Ralph entered the Ridge Road, about two squares above the house of the Fairmount Engine. He had no time to think of “De Fairy” now, but pushed rapidly onward, following the windings of the Ridge Road. “Once out o' this village, and I'll begin to talk,” muttered Ralph, when lo! a figure turned a corner, and came toward him with its hands in its pockets. Was it a watchman? Ralph felt his heart beat quicker, with thump upon thump as the figure came from the shadow into the moonlight. “It's one of the boys! Y-a-a-s! He wears his hat over his eyes, an' has his hair cut short behind, and wears soap-locks over his ears. Y-a-a-s it's one of 'em. Hello, Bokey, is that you?” “Why Jonesey!” cried the new-comer halting suddenly and surveying Ralph with one eye closed, in order to give the other a keener vision, “Whar did you gid dat ar wommus,” continued Bokey, speaking in a dialect peculiar to the more enlightened districts of Philadelphia. “You look like Matty Van Buren in Gineral Jackson's trowse's; if you don't” — et cetera. “Never you mind Bokey; I knows what I knows,” answered Ralph. “I say Bokey did you go to see Woodside about paintin' the frontis-piece of the Injine?” “Didn't we? I guess we did hoss. Them other boys of the Committee stood like stuck-pigs — couldn't say a word for their lives. But I spoke up to him. Didn't I? Well if I did'nt, may I be” — et cetera. “What did you say, Bokey?” asked Ralph, anxious to divert attention from the tin box, which he hid behind his back. “Says I, says I, Woodside, and says he, says he, w-ha-a-t? Says I we want a frontis-piece for de Fairy. What'll you have? says he. Then I told him, `Paint us de Genius o' Liberty chained to a rock in de middle of the Atlantic Ocean' — says I. An' he's a-goin' to it. Hello! What you got dar under yer arm?” He saw the tin box. “G-e-t o-u-t! Don't you see I'm 'ployed by the 'Nited States to carry the mail twixt Fildelfy and Manayunk?” With these words, he passed “Bokey” and hurried on, at a pace between a walk and a run. He soon came in sight of Broad street, where a gloomy edifice, one story in height, rose like an evil thing, in the moonlit air. A gloomy edifice, covering a large space of ground, and looking something like a State Prison in its 'teens. “The House o' Refuge,” cried Ralph as he passed on. “Don't git this child in that ar' place I guess” — and as though the building awoke unpleasant reflections, he turned his gaze another way, and increased his speed. “Where shall I go? Can't go out into the woods this cold night. An' I can't loaf about forever with this 'ere tin box under my arm? What shall I do? I should like to take a peep into it, but I can't jist now.” The box was very heavy and weighed like lead upon his arm. He did not hesitate, however, but pursued his journey until he stood in front of a high board fence, which extended along the Ridge Road, on the extreme outskirts of the city. A board was loose. Ralph kicked it violently; it gave way, and he passed through the crevice. Before him rose an edifice of pale blueish marble, which was surrounded by piles of stone and building timber. The roof of the edifice was white with snow. Ralph stole around, turned this building and soon came in sight of another edifice, compared to which the first was but a hut standing beside a palace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER NINTH. RALPH AND THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX. Do you see that vast structure, rising in the moonlight and looking like a vast edifice of snow? Do you behold the massive pillars which support its marble roof? Is it not beautiful — nay — is it not sublime? Around it are scattered piles of timber and stone; the framework over its windows — half shadowed by the columns — shows that it is yet unfinished, and still it towers into the cold blue sky, filling the soul at once with grandeur and awe. And do you see the outcast boy, who stealthily climbs the broad staircase, leading from the ground to the foot of its columns? Beside that great pillar he is dwindled into a very speck. You cannot appreciate the vastness of these columns, until you see them contrasted with a human being. And the moon plays upon the marble roof, and upon the marble flowers which wreathe the summit of each column. And a silence deeper than the grave reigns throughout the marble mountain, with its rooms like vaults and its passages like caverns. Ralph enters the great door of the marble edifice — the door which faces to the south. A chill like death fastens on his veins. For the place is colder than a subterranean vault. He crosses the passage, from whose marble floor a stairway ascends, and pauses in a moment in the centre of a vaulted chamber. The ceiling arches above his head. The floor is marble beneath his feet. A silence, whose very intensity appals him, encloses him as a coffin encloses the dead. And through a window, which is only half covered by unplaned boards, trembles a broad ray from the midnight moon. And in the ray, upon the floor of Girard College, kneels the Outcast Orphan who has been made a thief by a Police Officer of the great city, to which Girard bequeathed his millions. Hark! A footstep sounds without. Ralph trembles, starts to his feet, looks around, and kneels again. “It's only my fancy,” he soliloquizes, “the watchman's sound asleep in his box, and Girard College is the last place where the 'spect to find a fellow with a tin box at this time o' night.” The box is fastened by a small padlock, dangling from the side. Ralph has no key, and in fact is without the means to break the lock. A lucky thought seizes him. “This is Stewel's coat, and it 'ud be queer if there wasn't nothin' like a knife in its pockets.” Plunging his hand into the capacious pockets of the coat, Ralph presently drew forth a bunch of keys, a jack-knife and a file. With the file he forces the lock: the lid of the box opens at his touch. Then quietly he empties the contents of the box upon the marble floor. Do you see him in the moonlight, with his grey eyes growing larger every moment, and his ruffian face stamped in every line with dumb amazement? Before him lie outspread the contents of the box. Papers, bank notes, and gold in handsful. Never a more delicious banquet was spread upon a Banker's table. Ralph was fairly frightened by this display of Bank notes and gold. “Wonder if they haint pennies arter all?” he soliloquized, as he caught at a handful of the glittering pile, and suffered it to glide between his fingers. “Gold, rale gold — why, there must be a thousand dollars here!” A thousand dollars was the utmost limit of Ralph's idea of immense wealth. With a thousand dollars he imagined a man might buy the State House and the United States Bank together. “What shill I do with it? Where shill I put it? Cuss it, but I'm in a purty scrape!” Ralph rose and paced the floor; every step was answered by an echo, which growled through the vast building like distant thunder. Ralph, scratching his tangled locks and “cracking” his fingers, wandered up and down — alone — while the golden pile shone brightly on the floor. “I have it, I have it,” he cried at last, “there is many a dark corner under the marble roof, in the cock-loft of this college. I'll fix the business in five minutes, or my name's not Jonesey.” He gathered up the gold. Not a single piece was forgotten. He gathered up the parchment and bank notes. He placed gold and parchments and bank notes within the tin box again. Then crossing the vaulted hall, he entered another hall as vacant and gloomy, with a tiny thread of moonlight playing through its darkness. This hall was soon traversed. Ralph stood in the passage, or corridor, on the northern end of the building, at the foot of the stairway which, suspended — as it seemed — in air, led to the upper chamber, and to the roof of the College. This slight staircase, built of marble, was covered with rough boards. Ralph clutched the tin box, and hurried upward. It was very dark. A single misplaced step, and he would have been dashed to pieces. At last he reached the topmost step, and stood upon the marble floor in the story of the College immediately beneath the roof. “Dark as the very mischief; but somewhere here there's a wooden stairs, which hangs on the end o' th' college like a martin box.' He found the temporary stairway after much difficulty, and ascended the creaking steps. He was in utter darkness. His mind became confused; he was afraid, and would have retraced his steps, had he known which way to tread. He reached forth his hand, and it encountered one of those massive piles of brick which support (or seem to support) the immense roof of the College. And there, in one of those nooks which at noonday are dark as midnight, he placed the Tin Box, covering it with a mass of loose sand, dry mortar, and other rubbish which overspread the solid floor. “That's done. Now I'll make tracks for home, and have a talk with Fanny. Somehow or 'nother, Fanny has idees which I can never get hold of.” But how should he retrace his steps in the thick darkness? While searching for the wooden stairway by which he ascended, he was attracted by a dim light, shining only a few paces beyond him. “The stairs that lead to the roof of the College,” exclaimed Ralph; “b'lieve I'll go up and take a look at the moonlight.” Up the narrow stairs, between the huge walls, or masses of brick and mortar, which touched him on either side, he ascended. It was not long before he stood upon that pavement of marble blocks, which forms the roof of the College. That roof, covered with snow, was darkened suddenly by a long belt of blackness — the shadow of Ralph the Outcast, standing under the canopy of Heaven, on the summit of the marble pile. The sight which met his eyes for some moments held him dumb. The Great City, a wilderness of roofs, white with snow, extending far away in the clear cold light of the wintry moon! On the east, the broad Delaware shone with a tremulous lustre on every wave; on the west the mound of Fairmount, clothed in a mantle of snow, rose boldly into the cloudless air. Steeples, roofs, towers, on the one hand, and on the other, the country side, whose woods and fields and farm houses looked pure and beautiful in their garment of spotless white. The hills of Jersey, a bleak uneven line, broke abruptly into the eastern sky, while to the west extended a vague prospect of villages amid woods, of mansions on the verge of tranquil waves, and in the far distance rose a glimpse of the hills of Brandywine. Philadelphia was beneath the feet of the Outcast Boy. Embraced by her rivers — the Delaware, flashing broad and deep; the Schuylkill, gleaming like a silver thread — she slept beneath her countless roofs, a vast wilderness of wealth and misery, with the eyes of one of her ten thousand Heathen surveying her every feature by the rays of a cloudless moon. Oh, you may talk of the savage grandeur of the desert, untrodden by the foot of man, of the awful solitude which invests the traveller, who looks upon the world from the topmost peak of Chimborazo; but here, beneath your feet, is a desert, a solitude, whose desolation and whose loneliness are made up — not of rocks and stones — but of the misery of human hearts, scourged and lacerated by the fangs of a barbarous Civilization. Look at Philadelphia, as she sleeps beneath the moon, snow upon every roof — is she not pure and beautiful in her white robes? The outside of the Sepulchre! Without a garment of stainless purity — within `rottenness and dead men's bones!' Pierce their countless roofs; dive into the caverns, which spread beneath that mantle which looks white as an angel's wing; descend into the Sepulchre — What then? Look at Ralph the Outcast, as he stands upon the roof of Girard College. Yonder in the Penitentiary, which rises to your right — a Bastile that intervenes between your sight and the white ground of Fairmount — there are hundreds of convicts, who one day were Ralphs, and who now, having ripened from friendless childhood into felon manhood, are counting the slow moments of the night, by the irregular beatings of their hearts. Shall this young Ralph, ever ripen into the Dead Sea fruit of the Penitentiary? The young ruffian in his uncouth dress, raised his large eyes to the sky, and saw the moon shining there above, with a single star not far away, and then a chaos of half formed thoughts began to break in waves, upon the beach of his barren soul. Was there a God? Did HE love the Rich better than the Poor? Does HE care for me, poor outcast that I am — outcast baptized in want and hardship, and about to be admitted into full Communion with the terrible church of crime? 4 Thoughts like these—of course not expressed in these words—came half muttered from the lips of Ralph as he stood alone on the roof of Girard College. “I'll go home to Bonus Court, and take advice of Fanny,” said Ralph. Clad in his white coat, he descended from the College, left the grounds, and after passing along Franklin Avenue, for a half a mile, entered a southern street, which led toward Bonus Court. At the entrance of Bonus Court he stood at last. The darkness of that den, was only broken by a faint ray. A light glimmered from the window of the lower room. Ralph hesitated. “Wonder if mother's dead?” he said as he entered the Court—“Rayther think Fanny 'll be surprised when she hears I'm so rich. Did'nt I do that Stewel Pydgeon—G-e-t o-u-t! Charles Augustus Millikin you're a precious cuss, you are.” Ralph laughed to himself as he looked through the window, into the room occupied by John Cattermill the Drunkard. While Ralph hesitates before the window, let us return for a few moments to the summit of Girard College. Let us place the young outcast once more upon the marble roof, and listen to a Sermon preached by “a writer of immoral books.” You, that wish to pursue only the plot of this narrative, may skip the ensuing chapter. But you that wish to hear a Sermon, with Girard College for a pulpit, will do well to read the words which follow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER TENTH. A SERMON FROM THE TOP OF GIRARD COLLEGE, By “A Writer of Immoral Books.” Doth not a curse rest upon the Great City? Is it not better to abide in the shadow of the mountain top, where the air of God is free, where the child learns Religion at the mother's breast, where the calm scenes of unpolluted nature—the valley dotted with houses, the mountain rising above into the sky, the Susquehanna singing on among its mountain shores—lift the heart to Heaven at once, without the medium of the Preacher's prayer or the church's psalm? It is good to dwell in the free country. It is good to abide on the mountain side, where the sunlight bathes your face, just after it has left the gate of Heaven. It is good to abide in the vast deep woods, where every flower is a character of Lord's handwriting, and where the summer air and the winter blast are ever singing one great anthem of praise. But there is a Curse upon the great city. A curse that takes many forms and speaks in many voices, but is, ever—to-day, yesterday and to-morrow—the same. At noonday, in front of the Old State House, it stalks abroad, in the form of the Unjust Judge, who has learned his Religion from the bitter waters of Hatred, and who only speaks in accents of damnation. The Curse is in the streets in these shapes of misery and want, these Lepers of Civilization. It is in the Courts, where the dock swarms with criminals, while the bench is solemn with that Justice, whose sword is sharp only for the poor man's throat. There is a Curse upon the great city. With the lowly poor in their dens of want, in the narrow alleys where squallid crime drowns the fever of despair in draughts of liquid fire, and in the great mansion, where the revel, bought with the poor man's labor, roars on from midnight until break of day. It walks into the office of the Editor, the Curse of the great city. It pours vitriol into his heart, and points with vitroil his pen. To stab private character for pay — to pollute the mind of youth with advertisements that give immunity to lust, and for a price, offer to poison the fruit of the Mother's womb — to meet the cry of the poor man's agony with a sneer — to crush with a pious lie, every hope of reform, every throb of progress — to sell the rights of Humanity for a Dollar, as Iscariot for thirty pieces of silver, sold his God — behold the life of an editor who is swayed by the Curse of the Great City. Sometimes it is found in the office of the Lawyer. It turns him into a sower of crime, and he plants dishonor so that he may reap gold. With a brain palsied to all sense of right or wrong, with a conscience seared alike to the wail of Humanity or the still small voice of God, with a hand always grasping, always itching for the wages of pollution, beheld the Lawyer, infected by the Curse of the Great City. Gold! That word overspreads the horizon of his life. Gold however gotten, gold however won — wrung from the widow's palm, or torn from the orphan's heritage, or coined in the damnation of the virgin's heart — always gold. Whence comes the universal Curse? Whence this universal fever for the fruits of labor, without labour's honest work? Why this eternal combat, between man and man, between weak and strong, and all for the wages of the poor man's toil? It is because there is no such thing as Justice for YOU, while YOUR NEIGHBOR has one more dollar than yourself? Does the Curse result from the unnatural association of all classes of the human tribe in a large city? Sad and pitiful spectacle! Is there only one loaf of bread in the world, that you and your neighbor, must take knife in hand, and fight for the right to live? Does this eternal warfare, engender a spirit of avarice in its last extreme of lust, a morality of selfishness, that can descend into no lower depth of baseness, a Religion that has no more heart than the stone on which you tread, a Justice that, like the Hindoo Car, only moves to crush the weak and rend the poor? Jefferson, whose memory we will forever wear in our hearts, thanking God who gave us our apostle of Humanity, to say iron truth in the face of brazen wrong, once uttered a volume in this line — “A great city is the sore of the body politic.” What an ulcer for the knife of the Great Physician of souls. What a canker for Satan to cure with his vast fund of quackery! With Preachers that talk theology while man lies bleeding in the last ditch of sufferance; with lawyers that prate of Blackstone, while the Law of Christ is trampled under their feet; with Judges who whine forth words of smoothest sound, while they pour the miserable and the wronged, into the Alembic of the Penitentiary. Sweep the roofs from this large City at midnight. Look down upon the scenes: here a murder — there a seduction — yonder a forgery — then a midnight outrage that cannot be named but in a whisper — all crowded together, enacting at the same moment, going on under this moonlit Heaven, while law and judge and priest, are slumbering sound. Gaze from the summit of Girard College, upon the great city — the house-tops are uncovered. The Anatomy of civilization lies open to your gaze. Summon the fiends of darkness to your side. How they chuckle as these scenes unclose before their gaze! Then with a voiceless prayer, beseech the Angels, who watch yonder by the Throne, to turn their gaze for a moment only, upon this dumb tragedy, which only manifests its agony, in broken throbs. Look! The tears are falling from the Angels' eyes. Tears of blood? Yonder at the lonely hearth the widow starves, with her babe lying dead upon her breast. Yonder the bank directors hold their orgie, and plan a new and legal robbery of the common people. Yonder the White Slave toils at her needle, sewing the garments of luxury with tears, and bartering her lungs for a crust of bread. Yonder glides the Priest, under the quiet mantle of the night — he has just finished some potent sermon — something against “the Pope,” or maybe something flavorous with sulphur, upon “Eugene Sue” and “French Novels.” Ho! Sir Priest whither tends your steps at dead of night? Shall you take wine with the Deacon, or join the orgie of these smooth robbers, who speculate upon the gain's of the poor man's blood? Shall you, with the odor of pulpit and sermon fresh upon your garments, steal to these Homes of Baker Street, and tell the Lepers there, that the Lord Christ died for them? No — home to your study. The wine is good, and the pen is sharp. Before you spreads the Rent-Roll of Trinity Church. Come — we are waiting. Write straightway a good sermon, in favor of Trinity Church and her Forty Millions of Dollars. But while you are writing, look yonder for a moment, to that lake of Galilee — look firmly, though your gaze traverses the mists of eighteen hundred years — and tell us what do you behold? “The Christ who has just been preaching to multitudes of the Poor, is now sitting in their midst, feeding these poor with actual bread!” Is this your answer Priest? Do you pretend to believe in this Christ; you who preach to the Poor, and at the same time rob them of land, of bread, of the means of life, and of life itself? But look again from this summit of Girard College. Yonder in the lonely sick room dies the father, gazing around with a glassy eye, while the children and the lawyers are fighting about his will. Yonder in his snug room the Judge is sleeping — and there, on your right, the Penitentiary blackens on your sight. That great Coffin of Stone, in which the living are buried. Judge! how many of your victims are withering there? The night is very clear, Judge, and the voice of Abel's blood goes up yonder, from many a cell of the penitentiary. Do you hear it? No? But when you are dying, Judge, shall you not hear it then? Jeffreys was once as brave as you are now. Once seated on the Bench, he talked of “good old English law,” and washed his hands in blood. So legal and demure was Saint Jeffreys. How did Jeffreys die? Can you tell, Judge? Another scene! A maiden is kneeling at the feet of a rich man's son. He is smoothly clad in fashionable attire; she wears the faded garb of poverty. She has worked so hard, she has worked so long, for a wretched pittance per day — and there is so much wealth, so much luxury to be won by the mere sacrifice of her honor. Even she the poor girl has honor. The Rich Man's son is pleading — she is pleading at his feet, hesitating ere she crosses the line which divides Heaven and Hell. How eloquently he pleads! “No one cares for you. You work sixteen hours for sixteen pennies. I have money. You talk of Religion — what has the Religion of the Church done for you? You talk of Law, what has Law or Justice done for you? Poor, you must give your life for a crust. But you are young and very beautiful — ” And do you blame the White Slave, that she listens to the voice of Sin, when it comes clad in gold, while Virtue by the custom of the large city, only bears injustice, starvation, and cankered lungs? But we will descend from the roof of Girard College. The sights that we see, and the words that we hear, do not amuse us very much. Yet ere we go, let us look back through the shadows of eighteen hundred years, and ask whether the Gospel which shone from the casement of a Carpenter's Hut, shall ever walk in its divine force, along the avenues of the Great City, feeding while it preaches, and transforming the wilderness of despair into a Golden City. A Golden City! Golden with brotherly love, golden with justice higher and deeper than “old English law,” golden with impulses born of God, and working for the good, not of the greatest number, but of the whole number? O, if this leaf which I have written should wander down the pathway of the next century, and encounter the eyes of 1949, how will the readers of that era, living admist a redeemed civilization, wonder at the barbarous laws and fiendish theologies of the year 1849?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER FORTY-SEVENTH. [sic] RALPH AT HOME. “There's a glim o' light inside, but I can't see no one,” soliloquized Ralph, as he looked through the window, “Fust of all, I must get rid of this coat and these 'ere boots.” Ralph opened the door, and entered the room of Cattermill on the first floor. All was still. A candle burning fast toward the socket, shone over the comfortless place, but it was utterly deserted. “Where's John an' his wife an' his baby?” exclaimed Ralph, gazing around the naked floor and walls. “Cuss me, I'd forgot! Did'nt I see John with the gang, when I was in the dog-house? Stewel got hold o' him too! A precious Stewel! Nancy's up stairs with mother, I 'spose. Now for business.” Ralph took off the great coat. Placing it upon the fireless hearth, (he had in his walk from the College emptied its pockets) he threw off the heavy boots, and arranged them on top of the coat. “Here goes for a little 'lection fire,” he said, as he applied the candle to the coat; “I did'nt like to throw it away, a-cause I was so cold. Howsomever it 'ill burn. Look there! John and Nancy are poor folks,” he continued with a grimace, “and poor folks can't do without fire. There's a blaze to bring out the Fairy!” A heavy smoke, accompanied by a dingy flame, began to ascend upon the hearth. Squatting down like a beast on its haunches, Ralph placed his face between his hands, and — listening all the while for the sound of a footstep — began to reflect calmly upon the strange incidents of the night. “Sartainly Stewel took me for somebody else. Sich lots of fun as Fan and I will have to-morrow, when we go out to th' College and count them specie and bank notes! Now if mother could only live, we'd have a nice time of it together. Mother! 'Guess she's gone dead about this time, but” — looking to the stairway door — “Can't go up stairs until Stewel's coat and boots is gone into smoke. A precious smellin' pair o' boots them is to be sure! B-a-u-g-h!” At this moment, as Ralph half stifled by the smoke, was endeavoring to arrange the fire, the door opened behind him, and a form entered the lonely room. “A great deal o' fun can be got with a thousand dollars,” cried Ralph, when a mild voice was heard at his shoulder — “Mister Charles Augustus Milliken, how are you!” Ralph looked up and beheld Stewel Pydgeon. Stewel in all his plenitude of flesh, with his full moon face glowing over a closely buttoned overcoat; Stewel with a glazed cap drawn over his forehead; Stewel with his hands in capacious pockets, and a cigar in his extensive mouth. “Come, my young gentleman! Fork over that tin box, and then we'll come to some understandin'!” At the same moment the stairway door opened. The mild face of Hannah, the Millerite's daughter, appeared beside the visage of the Quaker woman, Martha Lott. Ralph, however, did not see them. He only beheld Stewel Pydgeon. Rising slowly to his feet, his bony from clad in its rags once more, he folded his arms, and confronted the Police officer. His matted hair encircled the upper part of his face, but his teeth were set, his lower jaw fixed and rigid as iron. “That tin box,” said Stewel, drawing a mace from one pocket, and a pistol from the other. At this moment, a scene of deep interest is progressing in the third story. The Priest with the skull-cap fitting closely over his brow, and small eyes glimmering from the depths of their socket — the Priest whom Ralph called from the Church of Saint John — is sitting by the bed of the dying woman. Her hand, stricken by pestilence, clasps his wrist as it has clasped it for three hours. He turns his gaze away from that face, made fearful by fever struggling with the damps of death, and shuddering in his dark attire, listens to the words which fall, low, muttered, but distinct, from her clotted lips. The candle is burning low, the fire has gone out in the sheet-iron stove. The place would be chill and damp, were it not for the fetid atmosphere of pestilence. The Priest is very pale; his thick lips have lost their hues of red, and the hand which the dying woman clutches by the wrist, quivers incessantly. For three weary hours, he has been alone, with the departing soul. Alone, (for Hannah and the Quaker Woman had retired to the room on the second floor) alone, and yet he has not been conscious of the flight of time. Those three hours in the death-chamber have passed with lightning wings. Many times has he endeavored to free his wrist from the death-clutch of the woman's hand, but never once has he wished to seal his ears to the accents of her Last Confession. Her face, with dark hair streaked with silver, has appalled him with its unnatural look, but her words have passed one by one, into his soul. For the Confession uttered by the dying woman was wild, improbable, exceeding in every detail the most incredible creation of fiction, and yet it bore truth upon its every word and tone. “I cannot believe it,” exclaimed Father John — at the moment when we take up the scene, at least three hours since his entrance into the death-room — “You are not speaking of human beings, but of fiends.” The dying woman repeated two names in a clear voice, while her eyes rested vaguely upon the pallid face of the Priest. “Reuben Gatherwood!” she said, “Lemuel Gardiner!” By the agitation which pervades the frame of the Priest, we can discover that these names have been uttered often, and with fearful power, in the course of her Confession. The Confession we will now repeat, in our way, leaving the Priest and the dying one alone for a little while. In our own way, for the exact words of the Confession are too fearful in their character, to be recorded on our page. While Ralph confronts Stewel on the first floor, while the clutch of that death-stricken hand holds the Priest by the bed of despair, let us look at a Leaf from the Past. Let us look at Tragedy which is enacted every day, but which has never been described in a work of fact or fiction, for reasons that will occur to every reader, after the perusal of the following Revelation. It is dangerous ground that we are about to tread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER TWELFTH. THE HISTORY TOLD BY THE DYING WOMAN. This world of ours has many beautiful sights, but the holiest spectacle which it offers to the eye of God, is, a husband and a wife sitting by their own fireside, while the winter's sleet and snow beats against the window pane. Upon the knee of the wife sleeps a rosy boy, whose tiny hands are folded over his breast, while the light of Home plays over his golden curls and over his face, which smiles in slumber as though a dream was passing before the eyes of his soul. There they are, shut out from all the world, the curtains drawn across the window, the old clock ticking in one corner, and hickory logs blazing upon the hearth, with a cheerful glow and an odor that tells of forest trees, green and hearty with the vigor of the summer time. The snow lays white and cold upon the fields without, beneath a dull and leaden sky. A silence reigns over the leafless woods, deep as death, and only broken by fitful gusts of the drear north wind. All is drear and desolate around that grey stone house, built upon the side of a hill, with a strip of woodland encircling it on every side but one, and that one side opens through the darkness of night a glimpse of Philadelphia, with a light haze resting upon its wilderness of roofs. Within the two storied stone house the old clock throbs in its walnut case, and the hickory fire burns beneath the chimney arch. The husband sits on one side, with an open volume resting on his knee. His eyes are fixed upon the face of the wife, who is seated opposite, her hands clasped over the sleeping boy, nestling on her knee, while her gaze rests dreamily upon the fire. The husband is a man of only twenty-five years. He has thrown aside his coat and boots. A loose dressing gown falls aside from his chest, and his feet encased in slippers are placed near the fire. A man of regular features, brown hair, eyes of clear deep blue, and a lip that gives a light like a ray from heaven to his face whenever he smiles. The wife is a woman, or rather a girl, of only nineteen years. Her form is enveloped in a loose gown of a light azure color, which, with its flowing folds, conceals rather than discloses the outlines of her shape. Along her pale face stray loosened curls of golden hair, and beneath the arch of her brows shine eyes that are as blue as a cloudless heaven. Her hands and feet are small; her cheek pale but transparent as alabaster; her neck elegantly shaped and white as a snow-flake. Altogether, it is a beautiful picture. You can imagine for yourselves the details of this room. The walls covered with a plain paper, the floor concealed by a carpet of rich warm coloring, the mahogany stand on which the candle is placed, and the mirror which, hung near the old clock, reflects the face of the husband, as he looks into the eyes of his wife. They are listening to the beating of the storm upon the window pane. As each gust of wind dies away, they are looking into the fire, and from the very coals framing some picture dear to memory. The wife suffers her mild eyes to rest for a moment upon her slumbering Boy, and the Husband turns his gaze from the cheerful fire to the glowing face of his Wife. Altogether, this scene is very quiet; entirely common-place in its character, such a scene in fact as may be witnessed in ten thousand homes by the light of a winter's fire. At length the Husband broke the deep stillness, which had prevailed for a quarter of an hour, by an exclamation: “God bless us, Alice!” he said, fixing his eyes upon the fire with a dreamy gaze: “How time flies! Here, in this quiet home, three years ago, we were married. Three years! And yet it seems but yesterday. Don't you remember, Alice, that it was our intention to have been married in the large mansion in Arch street, but you preferred this quiet country seat of Oakleaf?” “It is so beautiful in summer time,” responded Alice in a whisper, as she passed her hand through the curls of her sleeping boy: “and even in winter, when all is bleak and dreary. It is so pleasant to escape from the noise and bustle of the great city, and sit down by our quiet Oakleaf fireside. Then, you remember Arthur, that it was here at Oakleaf that we first met, when we were but children.” Arthur rose and laid his hand upon the golden tresses of his young wife — “Here,” he whispered, bending down so that his lips well nigh touched her cheek, so pale and transparent, “Here our first and only child was born, and Alice — ” his words were scarcely audible, but the pale cheek of his wife was flushed with a glow like the day-break of a summer day in June. As he bent over her, she raised her face and looked up into his eyes. Very beautiful it was to see her gaze, as her soul — the soul of the Mother and the Wife — seemed to pass from her clear deep eyes into the eyes of the Husband. “I may die.” she whispered, “Die in giving life to my child. You will not forget me, Arthur? O, how beautiful Oakleaf is in the spring! And yet when the spring flowers come they may bloom upon my grave!” There was a holy sadness written upon the face of the young Wife, who, on the threshold of the joys and anguish of maternity, spoke of Death with a tear, and yet with a smile. “Banish these gloomy presentiments, Alice! You will not die before me. And then, Alice, we should always bear in mind that there is a kind Father yonder, who guides the courses of our life, and does all things well.” Look upon this scene with your own eyes. Contrast the face of the young husband, with dark brown hair, curling over the forehead, with the countenance of the young wife, with flowing hair of sunny gold — a countenance chaste and womanly, in which the maiden and the mother seem to mingle — and last of all, let your gaze rest upon the sleeping child, where the beauty and the thought of each face, is reflected as in a mirror. Surround these three forms with the sacred atmosphere of Home. Listen to the music of the winter fire as it crackles and sings under the chimney arch. Listen to the voice of the old clock, as it throbs away in its walnut case. Hark! The gust beats against the window, but all within is the quiet, the unutterable peace of Home. What can mar the peace or wreck the happiness of this Husband and Wife, who find a Heaven by their winter fireside? And after you have surveyed this scene, and drank in its calm and unpretending sanctity, come with me to another apartment of this mansion of dark grey stone. Seated beside a lamp, which breaks the shadows of a small room, furnished after the fashion of the Revolution, behold a young woman of twenty-two years, whose jet-black hair and eyes darker than midnight, give a peculiar beauty to a pale face, with sharp coldly chisseled features. She wears a dark dress, which fits closely to her neck, and envelopes a slender but symmetrical shape. Her hand small and death-like, with long and tapering fingers, rests upon the mahogany table, on which the lamp is burning, and her eyes gleaming beneath their dark lashes, are fixed intently upon the person seated opposite. That person is a young man who seems prematurely old with thought and study. His figure long and lean, and bent as with untimely age, is clad in the Quaker garb. Upon his great coat of shapeless drab, hang particles of sleet and snow, for he has but a moment since passed from the dreary night, into the warmth and comfort of this dimly lighted room. His face you cannot see, for it is shadowed by an ample hat, very broad in the rim, and with fur like yellowish snow. With large hands clasped upon his knees, he sits there like an ungainly statue, his head drooped, as he converses with the young woman in low and measured tones. “You had a stormy ride from the City?” remarked the young woman. “Truly so. It is a strange fancy that induces friend Bayne to reside here in the winter. I even put my horse away with my own hands, for it seems there are no servants at Oakleaf but thyself?” “I am no servant,” answered the young woman, with a proud curl of her thin lip — “I am the friend of Alice Bayne.” “O! Thee sews for her, and she pays thee with food and clothing?” said the Quaker, falling into an ungrammatical dialect, peculiar to portions of his sect: “I had forgotten.” He spoke without raising his head, but his words were not without their effect on the young woman. She colored from the neck to the forehead — her bust small but beautifully shaped, rose and fell with quick pulsations. “As you please, Doctor,” she answered, “I am only a poor relation of the rich merchant's wife. A poor relation is something worse than a slave. I know that.” Silence prevailed for a few moments, when the Quaker remarked, in his whispering way — “Do they expect me?” “Alice expected your father, Doctor Gatherwood,” was the answer. “Ah! My father is palsied, and of course unable to attend to his patients. I have taken his practice off his hands. Why should Alice expect my father on a night like this? Was I not here, in this very house, two years ago when her first child was born?” The speaker did not raise his head, but his words seemed to create a singular emotion in the mind of the listener. Her slight frame, from the small foot to the white neck, shook with a violent tremor. Her features grew sharper and more compressed. She hid her brilliant eyes with her death-like hand. “I remember,” she said in a low but emphatic voice. “Does thee?” was the answer in a lower tone, but with an emphasis more distinct. These words, I remember, and does thee? unmeaning as they look on paper, acquire a deep significance from the accent and the emotion which accompanied their utterance. The young woman trembled as she spoke, while the Doctor uttered the words with a sound very much like suppressed laughter. “Does Alice Bayne ever speak of me?” asked the Doctor after a pause. “Never,” was the answer. “Does Arthur Bayne ever speak of me.' “Often. As the son of old Doctor Gatherwood, the friend of his father. And as —” she paused, still shading her eyes with her hand. Yet beneath the shadow of that hand, you may see the thin nether lip quiver with a violent tremor. “And as —” the Doctor echoed, without raising his head. “As the able and benevolent Physician, who, two years ago, saved the life of a beloved wife.” These words appeared to give a vast deal of satisfaction to the Quaker. He drew a long breath, gave utterance to an emphatic sound, which neither sigh nor chuckle, seemed a composition of both, and — “Ann,” said he, “thee may prepare me a glass of Jamaica spirits and hot water, spiced with a little lemon, and sweetened with sugar, as it is very likely that I will have to sit up all night, watching for the event which is soon to add another blossom to the hearth of friend Arthur.” After this exceedingly long sentence, the Quaker drew another deep breath and spread forth his large hands upon his bony knees, still keeping his face within the shadow of his broad rim. Ann did not seem to hear his words. Her hand over her eyes, she sat like a statue, her bosom heaving and her lip quivering. “Does thee hear Ann?” cried the Doctor in a sharp tone. Ann rose, and with a noiseless step left the room. Turning his head over his shoulder, the Doctor eyed her slender form until it disappeared. He was now alone, in that quiet room, furnished in an old-fashioned style, with a wood stove roaring away beneath the carved mantel-piece. Still he did not change his position, nor remove the broad-rimmed hat from his brow. “Well — w-e-ll!” he soliloquized — Truly a Doctor's life is a troublesome affair! Night and day one is the slave of every body who chooses to summon one from the dinner table or the comfortable bed. Arthur here is very rich, and loves his wife with an affection that is truly idolatrous. Indeed they are a comely couple.” At this moment Ann returned, and held before the Doctor an antique silver bowl, carved all over with flowers and Cupids, and steaming with some fragrant liquid, which poetically might be called nectar, but more familiarly is designated “Rum Punch.” The Doctor seemed to gaze intently into her pale face, as she extended the bowl, in her delicate hand. “Take it Reuben,” she said quickly—“Oh! such a headache as I have!” She pressed her unoccupied hand against her forehead. Reuben took the bowl, and seemed — beneath the shadows of that ponderous hat — to inhale the combined fragrance of rum, lemon, and sugar, with all the nostrils of his soul. At the same instant Ann glided toward the door by which she had entered, but passed for a single moment behind the back of the Doctor, pressing her finger to her lip, while her dark brows met in a frown. It was a picture. The lean Doctor in Quaker garb, calmly inhaling the fragrance of the steaming bowl, while behind him stood that slender form, with a pale face, darkened by an emotion which looked like the intensity of hatred or of fear. “Ann where is thee?” asked Reuben, without turning his head. She glided to the door, opened it with a sudden jar, and exclaimed in a careless tone — “Did you speak, Reuben? I was about going up stairs to see Alice for a moment — ” “Very good. And thee may give my best wishes to Alice and Arthur, and don't forget to say that I am here. Thee understands?” “Yes, Reuben,” said Ann, and with that word she left the room. Dr. Reuben Gatherwood was alone. For a moment he listened to the subdued echo of the young woman's footsteps as she ascended the stairs. After that moment was passed, all was breathlessly still once more. The sleet was heard beating at intervals against the shutters, and the wood-stove beneath the mantel -piece sung away, with a low simmering sound. Reuben rose from the chair, and advancing to the bureau which stood in the shadows in one corner, he held his hand for an instant over a capacious silver pitcher. When he returned to the light again, he held the punch-bowl in his hand, but it was empty. Bending to the lamp — his face shadowed by the broad rim you will remember —he intently examined the interior of the silver bowl. And at the bottom of the bowl appeared a white sediment, very thin, and scarce perceptible, had it not been for the strong ray of the lamp, shining into the glittering interior of the vessel. Dr. Reuben Gatherwood uttered an emphatic “humph!” “Truly his sugar is exceedingly white,” he murmured — “only the flavor is very peculiar.” Reuben quietly placed the silver cup beneath the table, and without removing his hat, drew a book from his pocket, and began to read by the light of the lamp. As leaning back in his chair he peruses the pages of the volume, the light shines upon the lower part of his face. You can discover a wide mouth with almost imperceptible lips, and a chin remarkable for its massive outline. The lips move in a peculiar smile as Dr. Reuben reads; a smile which indicative of neither joy nor sorrow, conveys a meaning which strikes you with an unpleasant sensation, but which you in vain attempt to define. “Truly these French writers are a very singular race,” soliloquized Reuben as he read: “Now here is a work by an eminent French Physician, with annotations on the margin by a Preacher of this city. The work itself displays considerable science, but the annotations are exceedingly curious. For instance — ” Reuben reads aloud, but in suppressed voice, the passage which follows — Hark! a cry, very low but full of agony, resounds through the Home. For the first time that sound disturbs the stillness of a Home which Marriage has made sacred to the eye of God. It is the wail of the young wife, who struggling in the agonies of motherhood, is about to give life to a first child. That sound only strikes upon the ears of the libertine to produce a sneer or a laugh. Brutal in his estimate of woman at all times, he regards her sacred agonies, when she is passing from the Wife into the Mother, with cold indifference, or a ribald jest. At this time, however, Woman is a spectacle for the reverence of men and angels. Her love consecrated by marriage, is now ripening fast into the fruit of a New Life. She is on the eve of giving birth to a NEW SOUL. She may yield her life a holy gift to her new born babe. She may survive, but volumes cannot depict, after what a chaos of pain and agony. At this epoch of the life of woman, what is the 5 course of your modern civilization? At this crisis of life and death, too often of life out of death, how does the custom of the world treat this woman, who a year ago was Maiden, who has been sacred and sealed to all but the eye of a Husband? It introduces a Stranger into the marriage chamber. It invests that Stranger with powers that far exceed what the most bigoted Protestant attributes to the Roman Catholic Priest. And to this Strange Man, society entrusts the life, and more than life, the purity of the Wife and Mother. And — “Truly that is very fine!” remarked Doctor Reuben, when he had completed this passage. “We men of the Medical profession are fearful people. Yet let me read further — Why should not Woman be prepared by education to fill the place which now is occupied by the Male Physician? Do you say that she is not capable of receiving such an education? The history of the world, the very fact of woman's organization, gives you the lie. How many thousands that are unmarried, or that are widowed, might by a reform in the opinions of the social world, be elevated into the position of Ministering Angels by the couch of Maternity! “How many!” echoed Doctor Reuben, while his thin lips curled with a frightful sneer — “That is the question? Truly it seems to me, that society might find this out some day. But until it does find it out, the world will wag as usual. Women who are unmarried, or who are widowed, may slave for nine pence a day, or take up the life and the wages of prostitution. But the idea of educating women into Doctors — is it not absurd? The public think so. Is not the public the best judge. Again — ” Doctor Reuben read another passage: How often have we seen THE Doctor, seated in his easy chair, bottle in hand, and a few chosen boon companions round him, telling with many a sneer and obscene jest, the secrets of some Home into which he has been admitted as a professional visiter! As a Student this Physician learned his art by practicing in the huts of the poorest of the poor. As a Doctor he gains admittance into the households of the respectable and the rich. Husband! you are wont to welcome the Doctor as your best friend. Listen to him now, as he tells in detail the agonies of your wife, and for the amusement of his bottle companions, pollutes with every elaboration of a libertine fancy, the dearest sanctities of your Home. Wife! you look to the Doctor as the saviour of your life; he aided you in the hour of life and death; he lifted you from death into life; he saved the child of your bosom. Behold this same Doctor as he leaves your home, and enters the room in which the friends of his leisure hours await him. Hark! to the laughter as he tells his pleasant story, and turns the anguish of your maternity into a brothel joke. “This is bitter!” soliloquized Doctor Reuben. “Truly these annotations flatter my profession. Yet hold — here is another note in pencil — ” How many homes have been poisoned forever by the treachery of an eminent, long trusted, and even sanctimonious Physician! Do you blame him, Husband? Reflect. It is yourself that have tempted him. You have placed life, honor, purity in his hands, and then wonder that he betrays them all. If the dark history of women's degradation were truly written, how many cases of lost purity should we trace home to the treachery of a confidential physician! “Very well!” was the exclamation of Doctor Reuben — “Worse and worse! What will not these Physicians do?” Doctor Reuben laughed and read on: There is but one remedy. Respect that modesty which is an eternal barrier between Woman and dishonor. Let no man cross the last and most sacred retreat of your Home. Let no libertine sneer, let no oracular dogma uttered by a renowned Professor, shake you from your purpose. Woman, and none but Woman, is the proper Physician by the couch of Motherhood. “But thee forgets, my good annotator, that Woman is a being of inferior intellect,” was the commentary of Doctor Reuben. “Doth not society think so? Should we not be foolish indeed, did we refuse to believe what society preaches?” Woman can be educated, and well educated in the most difficult branches of the Medical profession. The day is coming when the introduction of a Strange Man into the Home, will be looked upon as an act of shameless insult to the Wife, yes, as a crime only second to dishonor itself. Doctor Reuben placed the book in his pocket again, for he heard a footstep in the entry. In an instant Ann Clarke entered the room. As she came near the light it might be seen that her pale face indicated an effort to suppress a violent agitation. “Doctor,” she said, resting her hand on the back of his chair, “I trust you found your warm drink palatable?” The Doctor did not turn his head, much less glance toward the speaker, as he replied — “It was indeed pleasant. I thank thee, Ann. How do our friends come on up stairs?” Ann bent her head, and whispered in his ear. “Ah! indeed — so soon!” he exclaimed, and rising from the chair, left the room with a hurried step. And then Ann Clarke, left alone, sank into the chair which he had occupied, and clasping her hands, exclaimed aloud — “God help me! That I should be in the power of a man like this!” It is impossible to depict the intense anguish of her pallid face. The features were sharpened as with the touch of death; her eyes flashed with feverish light. “But,” she said slowly, “his career is almost done.” She paced the floor with irregular steps — now pausing as if the act of listening, now turning a horror-stricken countenance toward the light. “What matter,” she murmured incoherently — “A life like his only curses the earth. It is no harm to destroy a noxious reptile.” She paused, and glanced around the room, from the table to the side-board. “The cup, what has he done with the cup?” Ere she had time to solve this question, the door opened and Arthur Bayne entered the room. His countenance was pale and troubled. Go up stairs, Ann,” he whispered, sinking in the chair which the Doctor and the young woman had occupied by turns — “Quick, Ann, for God's sake! There is no time to be lost.” Ann hurried to the door, and as suddenly retraced her steps: “Mr. Bayne,” she said with a face utterly colorless, and a voice that trembled in every accent: “I have an important revelation to make to you — ” Arthur looked up with a mingled look of impatience and wonder — “To-morrow, Ann, to-morrow I will talk with you — ” he said with a hasty gesture. “To-morrow will be too late — ” “Ann, Ann, would you have me sacrifice the life of Alice, for the sake of any revelation, however important?” cried Arthur, his face flushing with anger — “Up stairs at once, and for God's sake!” At this moment Ann caught a glimpse of the silver cup which the Doctor had concealed beneath the table. “He has not drank,” she exclaimed aloud, wringing her hands, as her face was stamped with an inexpressible dismay. Arthur looked upon her as one would survey a lunatic. “Why Ann, what can be the matter with you? Who has not drank? What mean you?” “Nothing, nothing,” she replied hastily; “You know I was watching very late last night, and I am feverish for want of sleep. I will go up stairs without delay. Poor Alice! How could I be so thoughtless as to attempt to converse with you, on a matter which can just as well be told to-morrow!” She left the room without another word. The young Husband would have thought strangely of her broken words, and her hesitation, at any other than the present time, but now the extremity of his wife absorbed every faculty of his soul. “Doctor Reuben is indeed a tried Physician and a faithful friend.” He repeated these words very often in a low tone. Then resting his arm upon the table, and supporting his cheek in his hand, he gazed upon the floor witth a look of the keenest anxiety, the most harrowing suspense. The moisture started from his forehead; he pressed his lip between his teeth, and — wrung by the agitation of mind and body — even bit his nails until the blood started from his finger-ends. “If Alice should die!” he exclaimed repeatedly — “If Alice should die!” For three hours the Husband kept his weary watch, and after a world of suspense and mental torture, he heard a low footstep in the entry. Ann entered the room — her face was deathly pale. “Speak,” cried Arthur, in the tone of a frenzied man — “Alice — she is not dead?” “Alice surrives,” answered Ann in a whisper — “Come up stairs and look upon the new-born child.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRTEENTH. THE HISTORY TOLD BY THE DYING WOMAN. PART II. Not many moments after this scene. Doctor Reuben and the young woman entered the room on the lower floor together. The Doctor had assumed his overcoat and broad-rimmed hat; he was evidently prepared for a journey. “You do not intend to return home to-night Doctor,” said the young woman, as she paused near the door, while he advanced toward the light. “Certainly; I have many patients to attend to, early in the morning,” was the reply — “By-the-bye, Ann, will thee brew me another warm drink. Yet hold — come here friend Ann —” As he lifted the broad rimmed hat from his head, the young woman advanced to the light. For the first time we can gaze freely upon Dr. Reuben's face. The forehead is wide, but the top of his head is perfectly flat. The eyes are large, in color a cold glassy azure, and protruding until they are in a line with his brows. Add to these features, a nose bold and prominent, a wide mouth with thin lips, a chin large and square, and you will have a faint idea of the peculiar expression of Dr. Reuben's face. As the young woman came within the circle of the light, it might be seen, that her eyes unnaturally bright, shone from a face which was stamped with a corpse-like pallor. “Ann Clarke,” and as he spoke in a sweet and even voice, the Doctor's protruding eyes emitted a glance which penetrated the young woman to the soul — “Ann Clarke I have a word to say to thee. When a young woman, unmarried, has placed herself in a Doctor's power, by destroying a life which is the fruit of her passions — does thee hear?” Ann with her eyes cast to the floor, stood trembling from head to foot. She was silent. “Why in that case, Ann Clarke, the young woman aforesaid, should never think of mixing any white dust with the punch of the Doctor aforesaid. Does thee understand? Especially if that white dust should look and smell like arsenic. Do my words seem plain to thee?” Before these words were completed Ann fell at his feet, her eyes closed, her limbs stiffened, as if in death. Laughing heartily to himself, Doctor Reuben resumed his broad brim, and left the room and the house. In a few moments the sound of his horse's hoofs echoed on the midnight air. When Ann recovered her senses, she found Arthur Bayne bending over her, his cheeks flushed, his eyes brilliant with an unnatural joy. “Give me joy, my friend,” he cried, “Give me joy. Alice survives, and her child will also live. But you are worn out: this late watching has been too much for you. Take a little sleep Ann — I myself will watch while you sleep. Dr. Reuben told me that I need have no fear for Alice—” Assisted by the hand of Arthur Bayne, the young woman rose from the floor, and took her seat by the table, by the light of the waning lamp. “God bless us! What ails you Ann?” and Arthur started back at the sight of her face. “You are terribly changed within an hour. I scarce can recognize you —” Ann, whose face stamped with a livid pallor, was compressed in every line, as with the resolution of despair, raised her lack-lustre eyes to the face of the young Merchant, and said in a low voice — “Sit by me for a few moments, Mr. Bayne, and I will tell you all.” Her tone filled Arthur with a feeling of terror which he could not analyze. “All? What mean you?” “All,” she continued, “And when all is told, you may spurn me from your doors, or murder me if you like, but speak I must, and now.” Clad as he was in a dressing gown, the young Husband sank in a chair, his noble face manifesting a sudden interest in every lineament. “When you were married, Arthur Bayne, some three years ago, your wife gave me, her poor relation, a home —” “Do not speak of it Ann. You have been to Alice friend, nurse, and sister. Rather speak of the vast debt of kindness we — Alice, myself, our children — owe to you.” A smile crossed the young woman's face. Such a smile, as reminds you of sunshine playing over the face of a corse. “A vast debt, indeed!” she continued, with an accent of singular bitterness — “Hear me first, and then you can estimate the amount of this debt at your leisure.” With a voice that never faltered, and an eye that never once changed its glassy lustre, Ann Clarke, “the poor relation,” then uttered these words: “This is no time for woman's modesty; this is not the hour for maidenly shame. You think me a pure and innocent girl. Know once for all that I am a lost and guilty woman. Nay! Do not start, and gather that look of incredulity upon your face. Hear me — I shall be brief — and then form your own judgment. It is not for myself that I care, but for you and yours —” “Ann! You are surely in a dream —” “A little while before your marriage, I became acquainted with a young man who bore the name of Lemuel Gardiner. It was before my mother died, when I lived in a narrow court, and attempted to gain bread and shelter by the hard slavery of the needle. This Gardiner was a young man — not without good looks, and yet not pre-eminent for manly beauty. But his voice was low and smooth; his eyes always shone with an expression of quiet sympathy. He became — it matters not how — a visiter to our home. He won my love. We were then too poor to think of marriage. He was the only friend I had in the world. Blame me if you will, taunt me with my shame, but the truth must be told. I became his, and without marriage.” An expression of wonder and compassion stole over Arthur's face. “Poor as I was, I had yet rich relations, who would be horror-stricken at the story of my shame. Poor as I was, I yet feared the jibe and the scorn of the great world. While my shame was a secret in my own home, I did not care for the morrow. But at the same moment, when I became conscious that a new life was throbbing within my breast, I was told by my lover that he could never redeem my shame, with a marriage vow. He was a Priest. Lemuel Gardiner was a name assumed for the occasion. He was a Priest of my own Church —” “A Priest! It is incredible! A Priest of the Catholic Church —” “Spare that look and accent of horror. He was indeed a Priest, at the time of which I speak, but since then, he has been degraded from the service of the Altar. He is now, if I mistake not, a Convert to the Protestant Church, full of hatred to `the Pope,' and overflowing with gall at the mere mention of `idolatrous Rome' —” “I think I have heard of the man,” muttered the listener. “This lover told me that he could not marry me. But he would spare me the anguish of bringing into life a child, leprous from the hour of its birth with the brand of its Mother's shame. In a word, he brought to my humble dwelling in the narrow court, a very dear friend, whom he called Dr. Reuben Gatherwood —” “Reuben Gatherwood!” ejaculated Arthur, in a tone of unfeigned amazement. Her voice sank low, and deeper as she went on. Many times her livid face was overspread by flushes of burning scarlet. More than once she veiled her eyes, while her lips still continued that narration of dishonour and despair. “And thus,” she exclaimed, after the nameless tragedy of her life had been told: “Thus deserted by Lemuel Gardiner, the forsworn Priest, I became the bound Slave of Dr. Reuben Gatherwood. A word from Dr. Reuben could at any moment blast me with the name of MURDERESS! From the hour which Dr. Reuben entered my home, until this moment, I have been his slave.” “Reuben Gatherwood! I cannot — cannot believe it;” and the merchant looked with vague incredulity into the face of the agitated woman. “But Ann,” said he, kindly taking her hand within his own, “The past is with the past. Do not think that I have for you any emotion that approaches to condemnation or contempt. What need to make this revelation of your life to me?” “Because it concerns you, and none other,” replied Ann, in an emphatic tone. “I am in the dark; I cannot see the drift of your words —” “You will know, alas! too soon —” Ann hid her face in her hands. The young Merchant did not seem to hear her words. A smile that was born at the fountains of a generous heart, gave a new life to his handsome face. “And as to Dr. Reuben Gatherwood, he will never breathe a whisper of this early misfortune,” he exclaimed. “He is not the man to abuse the confidence of any living thing.” “Reflect for a moment,” said Ann, in a tone of peculiar emphasis. “For two years Dr. Reuben Gatherwood has (in the absence of his aged father) been the confidential Physician of your home. For two years has Ann Clarke been an inmate of your house.” Arthur could not understand the expression which came over the young woman's face. Her cheeks became more and more death-like, while her eyes flashed with dazzling light. Her accent was clear and distinct; every word from her lips seemed invested with a peculiar and hidden meaning. “I am in the dark yet, Ann,” murmured Arthur. “You have doubtless often heard the enemies of the Roman Church speak in terms of the utmost horror concerning the influence which the Priest exercises in every Catholic family. And yet what is the influence, what is the power of the Priest, compared to the confidential Physician? Once I heard it said, that a just Physician was the truest Minister of God on earth. Familiar with ailments of the body and mind, he can administer to the wants of both, while the Priest only pretends to care for the Soul. Can you imagine the power of evil which rests in the hands of the corrupt Physician?” “You speak in enigmas,” answered Arthur, smiling in spite of himself, at the earnestness and gravity of the young woman: “Upon my word, Ann, I cannot fathom your meaning.” “Enigmas! Alas, that an evil like that which I am about to describe, cannot be spoken of in any other way than by hints and whispers.” She paused, and her eyes assumed again that vague and dreamy lustre. Bending forward, Arthur earnestly perused each feature of her pallid face, as if to wrench from her looks the hidden meaning of her words. “The woman is mad,” he muttered to himself; “The story of her fault is only the fancy of a bewildered brain.” “Listen,” she said quietly, and then commenced a narrative, which held Arthur Bayne enchained for the space of half an hour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER FOURTEENTH. THE HISTORY TOLD BY THE DYING WOMAN. PART III. Mark the sudden changes of his face, hear the broken exclamations which escape between his set teeth, and then as the very apathy of horror gathers over his every lineament, guess if you can — if you dare — the nature of the narrative, that now falls word by word into his soul. At last the narrative was told. “I do not curse you,” said Arthur in a changed voice, “Nor do I charge this crime upon your head.” The young woman regarded with terror this unnatural calmness of look and tone. “Pity, for God's sake pity!” she cried falling on her knees. But he turned away, and with an uneven step left the room. The agony of a lost soul was gnawing at his heart, but his face was calm as marble, and as colorless. No groan came from his lips, as he passed along the dark entry and ascended the stairs. He hesitated for a moment, when he stood upon the threshold of his wife's chamber, but gathering strength for the effort — an effort that in his present state of mind demanded superhuman strength — he pushed open the door and crossed the threshold. A taper standing upon a side-table, flung a faint light upon the gathered curtains of a bed. Those curtains were like the driven snow, and from their folds appeared a small white hand, whose delicate outlines were distinctly drawn upon the silken coverlet. You cannot see his face, as he approaches the bed and looks within. A wife and her new born babe are slumbering there, but the curtains hide them from our sight. He for a moment conceals his face among their folds, and then lifts the white hand to his lips. Without a word he passes from the room. The Mother is sleeping with her new-born child upon her breast — whither tend the footsteps of the Husband and the Father? Ann, frightened by the terrible calmness of his manner, has passed from the lower room into the entry. In the dark she is waiting — listening. She does not watch very long, before a step is heard descending the stairs. A figure wrapped in a cloak with many capes hurries by her, and the next instant she hears the front door open and shut, with a stealthy sound. The figure is gone. The young woman would fain hurry to the door, and arrest his steps, but she is palsied. She has lost for the moment the power of motion and speech. In the dark she stands, clutching her throat, as though in the attempt to crush the agony, which swells in a torrent of fire, from her heart to her brain. Hark! The beat of hoofs upon the road, in front of the door — for a moment the sound is heard distinctly — and then it whirls away and mingles with the blast. “My God! He is gone!” ejaculates the young woman — “Whither? For what purpose?” The wind is howling around the quiet Oakleaf home. The sleet is beating against the upper window pane. In the room, where a dim light is glimmering, sleeps the Mother and her babe. The rosy boy, is slumbering too, within that soundless mansion. The fire on the hearth is burning low, but the old clock throbs on — the only sound within those dark grey walls. Look yonder on the road which leads toward the Schuylkill, and toward the haze now glimmering over the distant city. A horseman with closely muffled form is spurring on, through mire and snow, with the cold blast beating full upon his uncovered brow. He does not once look back, though Oakleaf, and a Mother and her babe, are slumbering there. Toward the city, with mad haste he flies, spurring his horse, as though he would fill the generous animal with some portion of the spirit now boiling in his own veins. Change the scene for a moment to Arch Street, where a line of lofty mansions, break indistinctly into the leaden sky. A horseman comes madly along the street; he flings his steed back on his haunches, before a door, which by the light of a neighboring lamp, glitters with a broad silver plate. Dr. Reuben Gatherwood — is the name inscribed upon that plate. The horseman dismounts. Muffled in his heavy cloak, he ascends the marble steps, and in an instant the bell is in his grasp. Hark! How that sound echoes through the lofty chambers of the mansion! After a brief delay the door is opened, and a servant clad in the Quaker garb appears. “I wish to see young Dr. Gatherwood on an errand of life and death.” Shading his eyes from the street lamp, the servant regards this muffled form for a few moments with a wondering look. “Thee cannot see him, for truly he is not in the house.” “Where can I find him?” was the next question, in a quiet but impatient voice. “Well — now — he has so many patients — truly —” stammered the servant. “Quick! I tell you man it is on a mission of life and death,” cried the muffled figure. “It is very late — truly it must be near morning. I rather think thee can find young Dr. Reuben at —” He hesitated, and surveyed the stranger with a cautious glance. “Where?” and a vigorous hand was laid upon the servant's shoulder. “Lose no time, but tell me at once —” “Thee is a very rude man, I must say. Thee can find Dr. Reuben at his Dissecting Room —” “And that is —” “In an old building, fourth story, in an alley that runs from Second to Third, below Chesnut.” The horseman on his steed again, urges him with word and spur, and through the sleet and mire, the sparks fly from the horse's hoofs. It is an alley narrow and dark, and in the day-time the sun-beam may scarcely struggle down between these high and gloomy walls. It is, at this moment of the night, as silent and deserted as the grave itself. From yonder window in the fourth story, a ray flickers out, and dies in the sleety air. Let us ascend to that window, and look within its dingy panes. It is a long and narrow room. Furniture there is none. The walls are high, the ceiling black with smoke, the floor spotted with blotches, and the solitary window, half covered with a ragged curtain. The atmosphere is dense and sickening. In the centre, stands a large table of unpainted pine, and upon this table burns a lamp, which emits a small flame, obscured by a cloud of smoke. By the table, or rather bending over it, behold a lean figure, with a black muslin apron bound across his narrow chest. The sleeves of his shirt, for he has thrown his coat aside, are spotted with blood red stains. In one hand he holds a small instrument of steel, glittering through the blood which drips from its slender blade. His homely face, is agitated by an unnatural enthusiasm; his eyes, protruding at all times, now seem about to start from their sockets. His lips, thin and wide, are tightly compressed, and his hard deep breathing, may be heard through the whole extent of the long narrow room. His forehead glitters with large beads of moisture. He is entirely absorbed in the task, which has called him to this lonely room. Upon the table, beneath the gaze of his protruding eyes, lies stretched the body of a human being. Only yesterday that body was the casement of a woman's soul: now, by the ray of the smoky lamp, behold the casket from which the eternal spark has fled. Alas! Alas! Not even the grave was a resting place for you, poor Daughter of the Poor! Many times, in want and misery you wished for Death, and prayed God for the resting place of a quiet grave. There, after hunger, cold, sin and despair, you would at last, be at peace. They buried you only yesterday in Potter's Field. They crushed your limbs, into the rude coffin, and laid you to rest, without a word or prayer, but with the music of a rattling spade and a falling clod. But even in the grave, rest is denied you. You died poor — science now demands your Corpse. It is necessary for Science and the world, that even the unblest mould of Potter's field, should be stripped from your unpainted coffin. The rough lid is tore aside, and your form grasped by the hand of wretches, who are forced to earn a dollar in this way, is huddled into a cart, and borne through the populous city to the inner Temple of Science — the Dissecting Room. It must be a comfort to you, Poor Woman, to think that all this is done in the cause of Science — Science that did so much for you and yours, while life was in your veins. And over this corpse, like the Ghoul of eastern legend over its loathsome meal, hung Dr. Reuben Gatherwood, with sharpened knife and gloating eye. “Immortality of the soul — let me cut the body into a thousand pieces — shall I find any proof of it here?” Thus soliloquized Dr. Reuben, as he bent over the corpse; “Truly the great Frenchman, Broussais, was right! Let me dissect these nerves, and I will show the cause of all sensibility. A cut or two at the viscera will reveal the cause of all passion. As for the mind it is only a secretion of the brain. Truly the scalpel is a great Teacher!” Reuben belonged to that class of Physicians who open the casket from which a diamond has been stolen, and demonstrate from the very structure of the casket, that it never contained a diamond at all. In other words, after the soul has left its casement, Reuben seeks for it, by rending into pieces, the body from which it has fled. Reuben was an Atheist. With all his knowledge of Science, the veriest Child babbling amid its toys, could have taught him a Science as far above his own, as the canopy of heaven is above the kennel. The Child can believe. Reuben was incapable of belief. “Broussais was right,” said Reuben, passing his knife along the brow of the dead. “Matter is God, and God is matter —” At this moment, the light was extinguished. How we cannot tell, but it went out, as though the wick had been snapt by a pistol shot. “Truly,” cried Reuben, as he found himself alone in the dark with the dead — “Truly this is singular —” Then a weapon descended upon Reuben's skull, with all the force of an arm nerved by frenzy. It was the stock of a pistol, or perchance a knotted club, but it did not give Reuben much time for thought. In the thick dark it descended upon Reuben's head, his breast, his shoulders. He made an attempt to grapple with his unseen enemy. In the attempt he fell backward upon the table, and upon the breast of the corpse. He lay struggling there, while the club or pistol stock, continued to rain its blows upon him. Reuben moaned, cursed, pleaded, but still the work went on. Beaten to a jelly, his face streaming blood, his limbs mangled, Reuben endeavoured to rise from the corpse and battle with his unseen enemy. “Devil!” he gasped, “Does thee mean to murder me?” An iron instrument struck him on the skull, with terrible, yes, fatal force. Reuben struggled no more. On the table, side by side with the dead woman, he lay, while a hand was inserted beneath his vest, next to his heart. Does the heart still beat? The hand is withdrawn, and a step is heard followed by the jar of a door. Late in the afternoon of the next day, a brother Physician entered the Dissecting Room, and found the mangled body of Dr. Reuben stretched beside the woman's corpse. It was a ghastly and repulsive spectacle. On the morning of the next day, a riderless horse stood covered with foam before the door of the Oakleaf mansion. And on a rock, beside the Schuylkill, a blue cloak and cap were found by a fisherman who was wandering near the shore. They were recognized, by a letter in the cap, as the property of Arthur Bayne. For many days Philadelphia rung with the details of two sad and painful events. “Dr. Reuben Gatherwood has been assailed by assasins while in his study, and is now lingering at the point of death.” “Arthur Bayne, one of our first Merchants, was drowned in the Schuylkill by the fright of an unmanageable horse.” These topics supplied matter for the discussion of the gossips of the street and the press, for at least three days. Three days have passed. We stand once more in the chamber of Alice Bayne. The curtains are drawn, the place is very still, a faint taper is burning by the bed. From the next room you hear the smothered voice of mourning. No relatives are gathered there, neither father nor mother, sister nor friends — none watching for the last moment of the dying Mother, save a solitary woman, whose tears fell unseen by any human eye. But in this chamber all is still. Once the bridal chamber, then the chamber of motherhood, it is now the chamber of death. She has been dying for three days. Ever since the word of her Husband's death reached her ears, she has been sinking slowly into the shadow of Eternity. Soon the mystery of her life will be revealed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER FIFTEENTH. THE HISTORY TOLD BY THE DYING WOMAN. PART IV. “Ann,” said a low voice within the curtains of the bed, “Has he come?” But there was no answer to the question. For no living being was within sound of the dying mother's voice. “Bring Harry to me, Ann. Bring him at once. I must see him once more before I leave you all.” Again the voice of Alice was unanswered. But soon, from the door leading into the next room, there comes with stealthy tread, a young woman whose slender form, is enveloped in a black dress. Her face, pale at all times, is now furrowed with the traces of burning tears. In her arms she carries the Boy, with clear blue eyes, and sunny golden hair. And the little fellow, unconscious of evil or death, struggles in her arms, and laughs gaily as he looks up into her pale, haggard face. “I will go to pa's room,” he exclaims in infantile tones, as he endeavours to release himself from her embrace. “He is home. I know he is. There now — don't you tell a story, you naughty Ann.” “Hush! Child! Your mother — your poor, mother is very, very sick” — whispers Ann as she surveys his laughing face with a sigh. “Ann, are you there?” exclaims a low voice. Ann slowly draws the curtains, and the light streams dimly in upon the dying mother and her babe. The face of the mother, half buried in the silken pillow, is colorless, save a tint of red on her cheek. Her eyes, large and bright, and impassioned with a mother's love, are turned toward the young woman, who stands beside her bed. One hand, white as marble, 6 is laid upon the coverlet; the other rests upon her babe, whose tiny face, smiles in the light, from the opposite side of the bed. “Ma! Ma! Let me see my little siss,” cries the Boy, clapping his hands, and making an effort to spring from the arms of Ann, upon the bed. A tear stole down the cheek of the young Mother. “Hold him near to me Ann. There,” she pressed a kiss upon the lips of her boy — “Go to bed, now, that's a good Harry. In the morning you shall see me — shall he not, Ann?” With a faint smile she uttered these words, as her white hand wondered through the golden locks of her boy. Ann could not restrain a burst of tears. For when morning comes, this young mother will be dead. The first sunbeam that steals through the window pane, will only light her white lips and glassy eyes. “When I am dead — you remember, Ann — your promise?” “I will — I will,” said the young woman amid her sobs, “I will take care of Harry and be a mother to your new-born babe.” “What is `dead?”' asked the boy, turning his large eyes from face to face. “You talked with old Doctor Gatherwood, when he was here to-day?” whispered Alice — “He told you that I could not last till morning!” The young woman could not answer. This preternatural calmness of the dying mother, affected her with an agony too deep for words. “Don't cry, cousin,” whispered Alice — “I shall soon be with Arthur.” And she lifted her eyes, with an expression of rapture, which you never see, save on a face, which has been touched by the holy hand of Death. Ann could no longer gaze upon the scene. She hurried from the room, bearing the boy in her arms. As she crossed the threshold, he looked over her shoulder, and clapped his hands, and said with a tone that we in vain endeavour to depict — “Morrow, Ma! Morrow I will see you!” The next moment the young mother was alone once more, with her sleeping babe. She spoke her thoughts in words, as she gazed vacantly upon the dim light. “Arthur and I were orphans, when we married. His relations live far, far away, and mine cannot reach the city until I am dead. Then it storms so, that our friends in the city, cannot come in time to bid me farewell. Ann is a good friend. She will be a mother to my children. That takes the bitterest sting away. Arthur! Arthur I will not be long —” Once more Ann entered the room, and on tip-toe approached the bedside. In a low voice, she told the dying one, that a number of friends — the friends of the husband and of herself — had just arrived, and were impatient to see her for the last time. “Let them come up. Yet stay — has he arrived?” “He! Of whom do you speak!” “When old Dr. Gatherwood was here this afternoon, I besought him to send me a Minister. You know, that neither Arthur nor myself were members of any church. Had I my life to live over again, I would more faithfully attend to the service of God. Has he come — speak — I would not die, without a prayer?” These words, spoken with great effort, caused a singular change in the listener's countenance. She stood with her back to the light, and therefore the dying one could not see the shadow which came suddenly over her brow. “A Minister!” she exclaimed — “Did you name the Minister of a particular Church?” “No — I did not. Has no one arrived?” “There is a Minister down stairs, but — ” “Why do you hesitate?” and Alice raised her eyes with an imploring look — “Tell him to come — do not refuse me, cousin.” As she spoke a third voice, interrupted the conversation: “There is no time to be lost — ” the voice was deep and sepulchral — “Sister I would be alone, for a little while, with this departing sinner.” As though every accent of that voice, was the poisoned sting of a loathsome reptile, Ann turned pale, shuddered, and with a quick movement confronted the speaker. “Lemuel Gardiner!” she ejaculated, raising her hands. Near the light, with hands clasped on his breast, he stood, his huge white cravat, contrasted with his dark attire, throwing his marked features, into strong relief. His eyes half closed and sunken in their sockets, his wide mouth with deep red lips, his prominent nose, and massive lower jaw, gave altogether a decided expression to his face. “It is I, sister,” he answered meekly. “You, and here!” the young woman confronted him with a flashing eye. “It is, I,” his voice sank into a whisper, and his eyes were dropped meekly to the floor: “Lemuel Gardiner, once a Roman priest, in the gall and bitterness of anti-Christ, but now a Minister of a truly Evangelical Church. Do you upbraid me, sister, with the sins of my early life? Do you refuse me the privilege of a moment's conversation with the departing soul?” He spoke very low, but his sunken eyes, suddenly flamed up, with a light that conveyed a deeper meaning, than all his measured words. Ann trembled from head to foot. “Pray! Converse! But I will — I must remain in this room —” “Must you?” Lemuel slowly raised his finger while a smile agitated his warm red lips. “Remember! Think again. Indeed, will you?” Ann without another word left the room. Lemuel surveyed the chamber of death, with a calm and complacent look, and then approached the bed, on which the dying woman rested, her decaying life soothed by a half repose, between sleep and wakefulness. “Sister, you are departing,” he said, as he bent over the couch: “Shall I pray with you?” She unclosed her eyes with a vague yet lustrous stare. “I am the Minister,” Lemuel whispered. “Thanks,” she murmured, lifting her hand from the silken coverlet: “Pray for me, pray that I may soon join Arthur up yonder, pray for the children that I am about to leave alone in this drear world.” Lemuel knelt by the bed. He prayed. Was it a prayer full of Love, upon whose every accent, the dying soul might take wing, and ascend in peace to God? No. It was a prayer of wrath. It spoke of a life spent in sin, of an offended God, of an eternity of torture. Up in the bed started the dying Alice, her eyes flashing with terror, her breast swelling fearfully, beneath the silken coverlet. “Hold! Hold!” she cried, spreading forth that hand, whose nails were already blue with the chill of death. But Lemuel prayed on. Low, but deep and sonorous his voice swelled through the silence of the death room. Tears streamed down his cheeks: he clasped his hands: he seemed to feel horror-stricken at the very doom, which he was compelled by his duty to denounce upon the dying sinner. Sinner? Remember, Alice was by the revelation of Ann Clarke, an innocent woman. Remember, by that revelation, Alice was unconscious of the treachery of young Reuben Gatherwood. And yet she was a sinner. A sinner lost to hope and mercy, with nothing in prospect beyond the grave, but an eternity of torture. Lemuel said so in his terrible prayer; Lemuel with sepulchral voice, and streaming eyes, and hands knit together, uttered words like these, to the ear of the dying Alice. At last, starting up in the bed, her eyes lighted with the fires of a preternatural horror, Alice cried in a voice that was interrupted by gasps — “O, Sir, what shall I do to escape all this? Tell me — I must not be parted from Arthur, in another world. Speak! Speak!” She sank back upon the pillow, panting, trembling, her pale cheek flushed with unnatural color. At once Lemuel rose. In the pocket of his dark coat, descended his large hand. He drew forth a portable ink-stand, which contained a newly-mended pen, and a small phial of ink. “Sister, do you think you could sign your name?” She turned her eyes to his face, with a look of vague wonder. “Sign your name to a piece of paper, which will give a small portion of your wealth, to the sick and suffering, who are without shelter and without bread?” He spread forth the parchment upon the coverlet. He placed the pen in that death-chilled hand. It was a curious parchment, covered with writing — writing in all kinds of text and script — and adorned with one or more seals attached to ribbons of a bright azure. “Sign, Sister, and all shall go well with you up yonder.” Placing one hand, behind her neck — among those curls of sunny gold which escaped from her cap — he raised her gently from the pillow, and pointed to the parchment, as he whispered in her ear: `It is for the poor. It is for the suffering. You cannot take your wealth with you. Sign!” A faint smile played around the lips of Alice. She gazed upon the parchment, with a large, a very bright, but altogether vacant eye. The light tinted with faint warm colour, her golden hair: she looked like death but still very fair and beautiful. The pen moved in her hand. Lemuel still lifting her from the pillow, kindly guided the pen, as it moved along the parchment. Alice Bayne — that name was written in a cramped, but very bold and legible hand. “Alice Bayne!” murmured the young Mother, gazing vacantly at her own — and her last signature. Gently, Lemuel suffered her to fall back upon the pillow. Quietly and suddenly he signed his own name opposite the name of Alice. “Brother Jacob, you can come in!” he said aloud. The door opened, and a short, portly man, dressed in dark attire, with small features in a very large and fleshy face, stepped over the threshold and approached the bed. “You acknowledge this to be your hand and seal, act and deed?” said Lemuel, as he turned to Alice. Alice smiled. It was a vague and wandering smile, that imparted a sad loveliness to her face. “Yes,” she exclaimed — “my hand, my own hand. Then you know I shall see Arthur!” “You hear her, Brother Jacob,” said Lemuel to his friend. “Sign your name, Brother Jacob. Here, Brother Jacob! do you observe what a pleasant frame of mind she is in just now?” Brother Jacob (otherwise Jacob Something, Esq., Attorney at Law, and Communicant of Rev. Lemuel Gardiner's Church,) bent over the bed, and signed his name, beneath the name of the Preacher, in a round and clerkly hand. At this crisis the door opened, and Ann Clarke, once more entered the room. She started as if stricken by a pistol shot, when she beheld the details of this scene — the form of Lemuel and Jacob in the foreground, with their gaze fixed upon the parchment, which lay upon the coverlet; while in the dim background, appeared the sad, happy face, of the death-stricken Mother. “What do you here, with pen and parchment?” she cried suddenly, as with a single step she reached the Preacher's side: “Lemuel, there is some mystery here —” “Only a bequest to my Church, Sister,” answered Lemuel, with a kindly smile. “That is all: a bequest to our Church,” echoed the short and portly lawyer, as he folded the parchment and handed it to the Minister. Ann surveyed each face with a deep and anxious look: “Lemuel, beware! There is a limit to endurance!” she whispered. “Ann, be careful! There is a limit to sience,” he answered. And his look, flashing from beneath his compressed brow, gave a singular significance to his words. Ann sank back, as though some inexplicable witchcraft had at once chilled her blood, and deprived her of the power of utterance. The light swam before her eyes. She extended her hand, and grasped the curtains of the bed, and it was a moment before her entire consciousness returned. She looked round, in search of the Preacher and his friend. They had disappeared. But over the threshold, one by one, came the friends of the dying woman. Grave matrons and aged men, young wives and girls in the blush of virgin loveliness, all swarmed into the room, anxious to take a last look at Alice Bayne. Alice greeted them all with an extended hand, and a cheerful smile. For every one she had some kindly word. And yet, as she spoke to them, she said at the end of every farewell — “I shall soon see Arthur.” Her eyes were bright, O, all too bright for this dull world of clay. Her voice was touched with angelic rapture. “Soon I shall see Arthur?” she never ceased to speak the words, amid those whispered farewells. The friends had gone: it was midnight: Alice was sleeping with her babe, beneath the pressure of her extended hand. Ann, with her head buried in the coverlet, was praying and weeping by the bed of death. Midnight passed, and morning drew nigh. She was sinking slowly—slowly, gently into death — talking all the while of Arthur, of her children, of heaven. “Take care of Harry!” she said, as morning was dawning through the window curtains. “And, do you hear, cousin? I want my baby called after you? Ann — Annie — you remember?” Ann did not raise her face, but reached forth her hand and clasped the hand of the departing Mother. That hand was cold as ice. “O, can you believe it?” said Alice, after a pause, “that the words which he spoke to me last night are true —” Ann raised her face, and saw the countenance of the dying woman, tinted by the first rays of the dawn. “What words?” she whispered, bending over the bed. “About a lost Soul, and a God who was angry, and torture after death,” said Alice, in a very low voice. “You can't tell how it frightened me —” A shudder pervaded the frame of the young woman. “Ah! Coward! Blasphemer!” she muttered, “Hast thou been tampering with the last hour of the dying one?” “Do you think the good Lord will shut me out of Heaven? I am only a poor weak woman, that have loved my children better than life. Do you think HE will be very angry with me? Speak, Ann, speak — I am going — will it be dark, dark with me, up yonder?” It is a fearful thing to witness the departure of a troubled soul. It is a beautiful sight — the holiest sight in all the world — to witness the going forth of a Soul, that goes up to God, as to a kind father. Last night, before her interview with Lemuel, Alice saw in the Deity, only a parent who was calling her home. Now — on the verge of eternity — she shrank back, troubled and afraid. The grave which had been all light, was now all darkness. You may imagine the emotions which filled the bosom of Ann Clarke, as she became conscious of this truth. She took the hands of Alice within her own. She gazed long and fixedly into her glassy eyes. “Alice!” she whispered, “Alice! Look up yonder! It is the Lord who now awaits you and calls you to your home!” Was there power in the words, or in the faith of the speaker? It lies beyond us to answer; but the face of the dying woman brightened with a calm rapture, and she raised her eyes heavenward, with a look that may have been only a reflection from the light of a Better World. “I see! I see!” she cried, in a voice of unutterable gladness, and gently pressed her hands together. The next instant she was dead. Her gaze fixed and glassy. She breathed no more. The young woman closed her eyes, and smoothed her golden hair along her marble cheek, all the while repeating in a low voice these words: “Depart, Christian soul! out of this world, in the Name of God the Father Almighty who created thee: in the Name of Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, who suffered for thee; in the Name of the Holy Ghost, who sanctified thee; in the name of the Angels, Archangels, Thrones, and Dominations, Cherubim, and Seraphim; in the Name of the Patriarchs and Prophets, of the Holy Apostles and Evangelists, of the Holy Martyrs and Confessors, of the Holy Monks and Hermits, of the Holy Virgins and of all the Saints of God; let thy place be this day in Peace, and thy abode in Holy Sion: Through Christ our Lord. Amen.” The first sunbeam came. It shone upon the dead mother and upon her babe, which slumbered in the arms of the young woman, who sate upon the bed. A glad shout burst upon the air of the death room. The door opened with a crash, and a little boy, with cheeks flushed with color, and golden hair floating on his broad shoulders, came plunging into the room. “Ma, it's morning!” he cried as he sprang toward the bed. The Mother is buried: the yellow earth of her grave, is seen distinctly amid the churchyard, white with snow. Alone in the mansion of Oakleaf, sits the young woman with the new-born babe upon her knee, and the boy by her side. There is warm light upon the tiny face of the babe, warm light upon the golden curls of Harry, warm and rosy light upon the haggard visage of the young woman, their protectress. What shall be the Fortune of these children? Wait, and we will see. After the Mother has been buried many days, her Uncle — her nearest and most beloved relative — arrives from the West, and hastens to Oakleaf. The death of Arthur is proved: and he sees the grave of his niece. This niece Alice Bayne, was worth, in her own right, something like Ten Thousand Dollars. Her husband possessed near Fifteen Thousand Dollars. This property was in stock, in lands, in houses and in gold. Did Alice make a will? This question of course is answered. No. Then, reasons the Uncle, the property descends to the children, to Harry the boy, and Annie the new-born babe. Of course the Uncle is correct. He is about to take out letters of Administration, as Executor of the deceased, When — Ah! That is the very point of the matter! When there came to Oakleaf the Rev. Lemuel Gardiner (or the Minister whose real designation we conceal under this fictitious name) and with the reverend Convert from Rome, came Jacob Something Esq., Attorney at Law. `The dear blessed young lady before her death, deeply affected with the perilous condition of the Heathen World, left all her own property to the Universal South Sea Island Missionary Association.' This was one half of the Rev. Lemuel's story. It may be as well to state that Lemuel was the President, actual President if not nominal, of the “U. S. S. I. M. A.” `Then she by her will appointed the Rev. Lemuel Gardiner and Jacob Something, Esq., Executors and Administrators of the estate. She also appointed these gentlemen guardians of her children, and trustees of her estate, until these children become respectively nineteen and twenty-one years of age.' This was the other half of the Rev. Lemuel's story. These events, you will bear in mind, occured in the course of the year 1826. You may fancy the surprise of the Uncle when he heard the story. As for Ann Clarke, she said nothing: the eye of Lemuel was upon her, but she remembered well the prayers which Lemuel uttered by the couch of the dying Alice. The Uncle thought deeply? Should he go to law? Go to law with the U. S. S. I. M. A., and fling himself into the face of the Church over which Lemuel was Pastor? The will was before him, properly written, signed by the dead woman, and legally witnessed. What could the Uncle do. He went out West again, and never saw Harry or Annie from the hour when he left Oakleaf until the day of his death. As for the Rev. Lemuel behold him installed as the Master at the Oakleaf Mansion. He is the Guardian of the Children; the Trustee of the Estate. For Jacob Something, Esq., is only a blank. And Ann Clark, protectress of the children, is notified that her presence at Oakleaf is no longer needed. A month after the death of Alice, Ann is coolly dismissed from Oakleaf by the Rev. Lemuel Gardiner. Two months afterwards, both children, Harry and Annie, are stolen from Oakleaf by some person or persons unknown. The Rev. Lemuel fills the papers with advertisements; he seeks for the children in every quarter; and after the lapse of a few more months, disappears suddenly himself. The papers, speak at length of his mysterious disappearance, and universal sympathy prevails, which is materially modified, when it is discovered, that before leaving, the Rev. Lemuel had sold lands and houses without number, and realized some Twenty Thousand Dollars in gold and silver. Meanwhile what has become of the children? And did Dr. Reuben Gatherwood die of the wounds inflicted by his unknown assailant? No. He suffered much, but he lived. His practice grew, his fees multiplied, his fame was echoed through all the Medical Schools. But not more than a year after the death of Alice, he also suddenly disappeared, and like the Rev. Lemuel Gardiner, was never again seen nor heard of in Philadelphia. But the children, and Ann Clarke — what has become of them? Let us listen to the poor wretch who is dying in the third story of Bonus Court. Still clutching the wrist of the Priest, she whispers the last words of her Confession — that Confession on which we have based the Narrative of the preceding chapters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER SIXTEENTH. THE DEATH-ROOM IN BONUS COURT. We are once more in Bonus Court. Again we behold the face of the Priest, who is held to the couch of death, by the clutch of the dying woman's hand. “I could not live apart from the children. I knew that Lemuel Gardiner had procured that will by fraud. I stole the children from Oakleaf, and changed their names. For years I worked and slaved to give them a support, and —” she paused and gasped for breath — “Behold the end of all!” Her eyes wandered about the desolate room, and the light revealed each repulsive feature of her pestilence-smitten face. The Priest, stricken as he was by horror, mustered sufficient calmness to ask a question: “Have you ever since 1826 heard of Lemuel Gardiner?” “Once, after his flight, I heard that he still lived — that he was preaching against the Pope in a distant part of the country.” Even touched as it was by death, her face assumed an expression of scornful laughter. “And Reuben Gatherwood — this treacherous Physician — have you ever heard of him since 1826?” “Some years ago, it was stated that he was engaged in the African Slave Trade. The name under which he passed was Captain something, Brad — Bradbury, or some such name.” The Priest's brow became clouded. “And the children?” “One a white slave; and the other an outcast. Yes, yes —” her voice rose in a shriek of horrible laughter — “One is hastening rapidly to the public streets — you hear me? Her future is that of the woman who traffics her favors for bread. The other is hastening as rapidly to the Penitentiary. And these are the children of Arthur and Alice Bayne! Don't you think this Reuben will have a rich account to settle up yonder?” She laughed again: “And Lemuel — O, the Apostate and three-fold Traitor! Would I could see him now, to tell him what his crimes will bring him to at last!” The Priest trembled at the horrible expression of her countenance. He endeavored to withdraw his hand, but she only clutched his wrist with a firmer grasp. “Come,” he said, “I will absolve you for all these sins. I must leave you now.” He began to repeat a prayer from the ritual of the Roman Church. It was the same prayer which many years before, Ann Clarke had uttered by the bed of the dying Alice: “Depart, Christian soul! out of this world, in the Name of God the Father Almighty who created thee: in the Name of Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, who suffered for thee: in the Name of —” “Death is near, and there is no longer a mist before my soul,” cried the dying woman, as her eyes flamed with an unnatural light — “Do not pray for me Priest — not yet! not yet! Not until I have told you the fate of Reuben Gatherwood and Lemuel Gardiner!” “Hold!” faltered the Priest, “you must not employ your last hour in curses.” The tone of the dying woman became strangely calm and measured. “I do not curse,” she whispered, “I only predict. This Reuben and this Lemuel are linked together in crime. Reuben a Physician false to God and man, and steeped to the lips in pollution. Lemuel an apostate Priest, a faithless lover, a wretch in holy robes who guided the hand of Alice, when she signed away the heritage of her children. Do you behold those comrades in iniquity? Have you listened to the history of their crimes? Now listen, while I describe the manner of their death.” “No! No!” shrieked the Priest, struggling with the hand which clutched his wrist — “I will not hear you. Remember! you are about to leave this world, with all its trials and its hatreds. Do not curse.” Up in the wretched bed, started the miserable woman. She flung her black hair, streaked with silver, aside from her hideous face. Then, clutching the Priest with one hand, she stretched forth the other — blotched by disease — as though pointing toward a scene, which rose before her glazing eyes: “They shall die together,” she whispered, “Reuben and Lemuel locked in the embrace of despair, and taunting each other with their mutual crimes. Do you not see them? Look! Look! There —” Her voice was gone. With that prophecy, uttered by lips livid and loathsome with the pestilence, her soul passed away. The Priest was grasped by a dead hand, whose fingers encircled his wrist with a clutch of iron. His harsh features, thrown into relief by his skull-cap, were distorted by a look of fright and terror. “Take your hand from my wrist,” he cried, “I will not hear your curses! Away! away! Don't force me to battle with a dying woman.” Bewildered by his fright, he started to his feet, but the hand still clutched his wrist. “Curses upon my folly! Why did I enter this den? Why, lured by the hope of hearing something that might bring me gold, did I hurry to the death bed of Ann Clarke?” with his freed hand he wiped the cold moisture from his forehead — “Ann, you should not be revengeful,” his voice fell into an accent of whining entreaty — “We are all frail — not one of us is free from sin. I am not the cause of the degradation of these children. Indeed I am not.” His voice grew faint and fainter. He sank on his knees. His eyes closed, and his head fell forward, upon the ragged coverlet. His black skull-cap and dark attire, were distinctly disclosed by the light fading in its socket, while gaunt and loathsome, the body of the dead woman, half uncovered, was stretched upon that bed of despair. No one was there to close her lifeless lids. Her jaw had fallen, and her cold eyes seemed to glare with a defiant look, upon the Priest, whose face was buried in the coverlet near her side. The light was fading low and lower, the place was still with the stillness of death, and the dead woman's hand still clutched the wrist of the Priest. Once more we return to the room on the first floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER SEVENTEENTH. RALPH AND STEWEL ONCE MORE. “That ar' tin box,” said Stewel, puffing his cigar. Ralph once more clad in his outcast rags, confronted him with folded arms, and teeth set together. “What does thee mean!” asked a mild sweet voice, as Martha Lott advanced from the shadows. “Thou hadst better put thy pistol and thy club into thy pocket again.” Poor Hannah Marvin said nothing, but her eyes expanded with a look of vague wonder. “What do I mean?” said Stewel, as with mace and pistol, he seemed to embody all the plenitude of the Law, in his own corpulent person: “Why it's enough to break a-body's heart, so it is. Here's this young gallus been robbin' a most respectable individual of a tin box filled with valleyable papers. A parfic burglar Ma'am!” “Ralph what has thee to say to this?” said Martha Lott laying her hand gently upon his shoulder. Ralph was silent. With knit brows and compressed lips, he was endeavouring to solve a singular problem, or rather a series of problems. Had Stewel really taken him for a rich man's son, whose name was Charles Augustus Millikin? Or, had Stewel, knowing his residence in Bonus Court, deliberately planned the robbery, and aided him in his escape from Brother Caleb's House? These queries were passing through the mind of Ralph: he was bewildered by a torrent of suspicions and surmises which buzzed like a nest of bees, in his brain. “What do you mean? S-a-y?” he exclaimed, determined to put a bold face upon the matter: “I know nothin' o' yer tin box. Yer mistaken in the person — you are.” Stewel, pistol in one hand and mace in the other, advanced a step, and whispered a few words, audible only to the outcast boy. “You see young man, I know'd you had genus, and so I put the management o' this little affair into your hands. I seed you often with the Fairy boys, and I ses, ses I, here's the young man, as can make his fortin by helpin' the Constitooshun and Laws. You take? I'm the Constitooshun and Laws; I am. Well, my chick, when I heer'd these covies were plannin' the robbery of Goodleigh's house, I pitched upon you as the very chap to settle their hash. I kidnapped you in front of the Church, made believe that I thought you was Charles Augustus Milliken, and put you, in the dark, into Goodleigh's house. Don't you take yit? Why bless your soul, I know'd you'd git the tin box all the while — you're so enterprizin'! And I know'd you'd make a straight track for Bonus Court — though I took keer not to tell you so. And now my dear, I've killed two birds with one stone. I've got the robbers safe in the lock-up, and through you, I've got the tin box. D'ye see? Jist pitch it over, and say no more about it.” Ralph heard this candid explanation with a singular complication of emotions. It was clear that Stewel himself had planned the robbery. No less clear, that Stewel himself, had entangled each one of the burglars, in a plot to rob Goodleigh's house. And clearest of all, that he, Ralph Jones, familiarly termed “Jonesey the B'iler,” had been made the scape-goat of Stewel's “speculation,” and the dupe of Stewel's pleasant game of “Constitooshun and Laws.” Will Ralph give up the tin box, and thus put the cap-stone to Stewel's magnificent scheme? Let us listen. “Go way from me,” growls Ralph squaring his elbows: “You're gass-y man! What do yer mean, by jawin' about a tin box? Get out!” Stewel cocked the pistol. Stewel brandished the mace. “Come along,” he said mildly, as he puffed his cigar — “We'll quit these primises together. Moyamensin's the word.” With one movement the Quaker woman and the Millerite's daughter, advanced and interrupted the scene, with their respective exclamations: “Take care! you will shoot him!” cried Hannah. “Friend, thou art behaving exceedingly bad,” said Martha Lott. “Fie! Shame on thee! to brandish these weapons at the breast of a defenceless child!” “Let him come on,” growled Ralph: “If he shoots he'll be hung. An' there 'aint been a Polees Offisser hung for these fifty years. Won't it be a sight? Crickey! How he'll kick!” And Ralph, as if inspired by the picture drawn by his vivid fancy, burst into a hearty fit of laughter. At the same time, eyeing Stewel from head to foot, he added in a more quiet tone — “It 'll take a thunderin' rope, though! Why you must weigh six hundred. Was you ever 'sibited in a cattle show?” Stewel was but human. Even the placid current of his official temper was ruffled by the taunts of the ruffian boy. He dashed the cigar from his mouth. “Now will you come, or won't you come?” he brandished his mace before the eyes of Ralph. “Thee had better go with him,” said the Quaker Woman. “Doubtless he is mistaken. To-morrow all things can be made right.” The mild voice, the calm face of the Quaker woman, seemed to subdue the rugged spirit of the young ruffian. His face changed; he seemed to hesitate whether to make an attack upon Stewel, or to submit quietly to his guidance. “Go, Ralph,” whispered Hannah: “in the morning father will get you bail —” “What if I give up the tin box?” said Ralph suddenly — “That is, admittin' for argument sake, that I've got the tin box?” Stewel's face brightened. “Why then my lad, I'll give you an even ten dollars, and say no more about it.” “An' if I won't give it up?” “Then you snooze in Moyamensin' to-night and come up afore Judge Choktaw at the next Court —” “Chocktaw?” echoed Martha Lott — “Whom does thee call Chocktaw.” Stewel cast upon the questioner a look of bland condescension and replied: “Chocktaw is an ornament to any Christ'en community. He does things up brown, I tell you. If you come before him, he just takes a squint at your dress, and at a squint he knows your character, and measures your punishment. He's down on rags, I tell ye. Rags always get a full dose in the Pennytensherry, Rags does when Choktaw's on the bench. But 7 broadcloth — Lord! How he loves it, and smoothes over its weakness, and remembers what a good family it comes from! Choktaw's one of 'em.” “I gin in,” interrupted Ralph: “Come up stairs. The tin box is yours.” He moved toward the stairway, but Stewel arrested his step with a levelled pistol. “None of your attempts to escape,” he exclaimed: “The first move o' that kind you make, I fire. You know? Go ahead — I'm at your heels.” Ralph accordingly ascended the stairs, followed close by Stewel, with mace and pistol in his hand. “Well!” cried Martha Lott, as they disappeared — “This surprises me! Ralph has not been up stairs, and therefore I conclude that the tin box is not there.” “And the poor Mother is alone there, making confession to the Priest,” added Hannah. “She will not last until to-morrow. Where does Fanny stay?' And with evident impatience the twain awaited the re-appearance of Ralph and Stewel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER EIGHTEENTH. “THE CONVERTED MONK.” As Ralph ascended the stairs, followed by Stewel, a crowd of opposing thoughts struggled through his busy brain. “There's a trap door in the ceilin' and I might get through that ar' door into the loft and from the loft out upon the roof, and then good mornin' to ye Mister Stewel Pydgeon!” So Ralph determined to escape from Stewel by the trap-door, in the ceiling of the third story. He passed through the room on the second floor. It was wrapped in darkness. “Where are you feller?” cried Stewel and Ralph heard the click of his pistol: “The fust sign o' foul play, and I shoot —” “'Nother story higher,” answered Ralph: “Come on! Here's the stairs! You shall have yer tin box, or my name's not Jonesey.” They were ascending the stairway which led upward into the death room. Ralph's heart beat wildly under its ragged jacket, as he saw the light shining through the chinks of the door. He laid his hand upon the latch. “Wonder how mother is?” he said, and opened the door. Stewel followed him into the room, closed the door, and calmly surveyed the various details of the scene. The Corpse resting upon the ragged bed, with a red gleam of light playing upon its disfigured features. The dark figure kneeling beside the bed, with one hand grasped by the hand of the dead. The light flickering in its socket, now shooting up in a vivid flash, and suddenly dying away, until the blank walls and the miserable bed, were wrapped in vague twilight. Stewel beheld the scene, and uttered, in his surprise a blasphemous oath. His hands sank by his side; both mace and pistol were pointed to the floor. As for Ralph he did not seem to heed the kneeling figure, nor remark the tattered coverlet, which gave such a look of utter misery to that scene of death. The first sight, the only sight that enchained his gaze, was the face of the dead woman, the cold eyes fixed upon the ceiling and the black hair, streaked with silver, floating over her clammy forehead. Ralph passed his hands through his hair. He picked the buttons of his ragged coat. And standing by the bed with large, lack-lustre eyes, he continued to thread his matted hair, and pull the buttons of his coat, while Stewel remained like one spell-bound at his side. “I guess the old woman's dead. Don't you think she's dead?” he whispered, turning to Stewel, with a strange grimace on his face. “Kicked the bucket — eh?” And then he laughed. Such a laugh! Low, and growling through his set teeth, it even made Stewel start aside, as though something unpleasant had stricken him in the face. “What a cuss!” muttered Stewel — “aint got no nateral feelin's.” Ralph, who in good sooth, felt in every nerve that Death was in the room, but who did not know how to control or to express his feelings, seated himself quietly upon the bed, and laid his hand upon the head of the corpse. “So you're gone, old woman,” he muttered, with an idiotic grin upon his face: “Left us for good — hey? No more hard work, and slavin' and starvin' where you're gone to?” Thus saying Ralph pulled his matted hair over his eyes, and Stewel by the uncertain light, saw a large tear glitter down the cheek of the ruffian boy. Stewel began to feel exceedingly uncomfortable. He felt that the dignity of the Magistracy was in danger. “Come, hand us over the tin box, and we'll say no more about it,” he said, with some effort, for there was a thick and choking sensation in his throat. “Go round 'tother side o' th' bed,” answered Ralph — “Feel under the pillow.” Stewel without a word, passed the figure of the kneeling Priest, and in a second stood between the bed and the wall. “What's the matter with that Preacher?” he exclaimed, pointing to the unconscious man —“Where did you say? Under the pillow?” “Y-a-a-s,” muttered Ralph. Stewel laid both mace and pistol upon the bed, while his eyes began to tremble with an expression of serene complacency. Stewel muttered, “the tin box is here — is it?” and placed one hand beneath the pillow, bending very low in the action. Ralph silently tore the hand from the wrist of the Priest, and lifted the body of the dead woman in his arms. When Stewel looked up he was confronted by that half-covered form; that face, stricken by pestilence in its most loathsome phase, was right before his eyes. The fixed eyeballs were glaring upon him; the naked arms dangling by the side of the corpse, only half concealed by the streaming hair, touched his hands. At this moment the light died away and flashed up wildly, giving the raised corpse, a look which bore a ghastly resemblance to life. “There! Take yer tin box!” shouted Ralph, and pushed the corpse against the breast of the Police officer. At the same intant he seized the mace and pistol, and started to the door. “Follow me, and you'll git jesse!” cried Ralph as he opened the door, levelling the pistol at the face of Stewel. “How do you like it, old hoss? Come and ask for a tin box when there's a dead woman about?” Stewel shrank back horror-stricken from the cold touch of the corpse, and in his effort to release himself from that loathsome contact, he missed his footing and fell to the floor. The body of the dead woman, fell heavily upon him, its face close to his own, its hair streaming over his shoulders. “Good bye, old boy!” he heard the voice of Ralph, and then felt the jar of the closing door. You may imagine that it was some time, ere the Police officer could recover sufficient presence of mind, to extricate himself from his unpleasant situation. Shuddering, in every fibre of his corpulent frame, he raised the corpse, and placed it once more upon the couch. Stewel's face was no longer red: every vestige of color had fled from his round fat cheeks. He uttered an oath, and came round the bed, with unsteady steps, passing his hand over his eyes, as though he was the victim of some horrible dream. “Why cuss the thing, the boy is gone!” he ejaculated at last: “Where's the pistols? Hello? I'm sold — reglar'ly sold. Fire! murder! Stop thief!” He was hurrying to the door, when his footsteps were arrested by the Priest, who aroused from his swoon by the action of Ralph, now stood silent and pale, in the centre of the room, his arms folded over his narrow chest. He lifted his eyes to the face of Stewel, without raising his downcast head. “You here? Lemuel Gardiner! That is to say, Father John, alias Converted Priest, alias Monk of Blarney! Why I thought you was a firin' at the Pope — aint this your lectur' night?” Stewel stopped suddenly, and surveyed the man of a dozen aliases from head to foot. In this slender personage, with that coarsely featured face, surmounted by a black skull cap, Stewel recognized an old friend, whose real name long lost to the mass of Philadelphians, was vividly remembered by the Police Officer. Lemuel Gardiner — whose name was uttered with curses by the dying woman — has returned to the Quaker City, after many years absence, and in a new character. Once known as a Converted Priest, then as a fugitive for Justice — behold him now, in the character of a Converted Monk. For Lemuel has taken the No-Popery people by the inmost heart, and Lemuel delivers lectures against the Pope, to audiences composed of boys and girls, at a quarter of a dollar per head. Sweet lectures, too, composed of all that is foul in thought or language, and refreshingly spiced with a fervent hate of Rome, and all that appertains to the very name of Rome. And now, Lemuel Gardiner, otherwise called Father John, and more frequently the Converted Monk, regarded Stewel with a cautious and searching look. His small eyes sunk deeper in their sockets, and his lips, remarkable for their gross expression, were agitated by a violent grimace. “Stewel,” he whispered, “We knew one another in other times — many years ago.” “We did hoss,” was the quick response of the Police officer. “You know me well, and I know you. To come to the question at once, did you ever hear of the Ship Falcon?” His face was animated by a look of sudden malignity; his voice grew hard and strident. “The Ship Falcon?” responded Stewel, “Why bless you `Monk,' that's the slave ship, as has been seized by the 'Nited States authorities. She was brought in from the coast o' Brazil by an American Frigate. She's now layin' safe and snug, over yonder, in the bay o' New York.” “Very well,” continued Lemuel, “Did you ever hear of Captain Bradburne?” Stewel could not restrain an ejaculation, which was more remarkable for its nervous force then for its elegance or polish: “Burn my time! Of course I have! Don't you think I read the papers? Wonder if he overheerd my talk with Ralph? Does he know anythin' about the tin box!” The italicised words were uttered to himself, in a tone which was unintelligible to the `Converted Monk.' “Captain Bradburne was the commander of the Slave vessel,” quietly remarked Lemuel. “He escaped, just afore his ship was taken off Brazil,” interrupted Stewel. “The authorities have been in pursuit of him, for at least three months. They are very anxious to secure him, as he made himself notorious as the Captain of a Slave Ship —” “Not mentionin' the half a million he's made by that very rispectable business,” again interrupted Stewel. Lemuel, without heeding this interruption, continued in a lower voice — “He has been heard of, since the seizure, in various parts of the Union. Under various names too, and in all kinds of disguises. Come, Stewel, what do you think his capture would be worth?” He placed his hand abruptly upon Stewel's shoulder, as his small eyes, buried in their sockets, shone with a sudden and sinister lustre. “Worth?” echoed Stewel, with a vacant stare, “Does he know anythin' o' th' tin box?” he added to himself. “Why you know Stewel, that his capture will be worth at least ten thousand dollars to his captors. Suppose him once taken, and the proofs of his guilt brought clearly home to him?” “He'd give ten thousand to get off — hey?” “Or, the Government would give ten thousand, for proof, which would convict him. Do you understand Stewel?” Stewel as if impressed by a new thought uttered an ejaculation, and struck his forehead violently with his clenched hand: “Stoopid! Captain Bradburne of the Falcon!” he said in a low voice — “Did not I hear that name to-night somewhere? Where? Was it at Goodleigh's house?” “Goodleigh?” cried Lemuel, “I think you uttered that name?” “Caleb Goodleigh, the man what owns a mint or two of the dimes,” answered Stewel, “He lives in — street and —” “Caleb Goodleigh and Captain Bradburne are the same person,” Lemuel's voice sank, while his eyes lifted up with a sudden lustre: “Do you understand me, now?” “Ho, ho! Now I know what the tin box contained. Valleyable papers; indeed! I rather guess so. Why Lem, my dear, this Captain Bradburne 'ud give thirty thousand, yes fifty thousand to get off!” One word in these somewhat incoherent remarks of the Police Officer arrested the attention of the `Converted Monk:' “The tin box? What do you know of the tin box?” “It was stolen to-night from Goodleigh's house. As we're chums now, I'll tell you the whole story. The boy what jist escaped stole it — I was arter him, when you started up afore me. That box, that identical box, contained the proofs of Goodleigh's connection with the Slave trade? Hey? Come — there's no time to be lost. Let's make tracks arter him —” “Hush!” said the `Converted Monk,' raising his right hand with a gesture of caution: “The tin box contained valuable papers, but the most valuable are concealed in Goodleigh's house, in — Street. Do you want to arrest him tonight? Come with me. I have a key to his front door. You can secure him in his bed, while I search the Iron Room, where these papers are concealed.” He moved a step toward the door, but Stewel grasped him by the arm: “Wait a minnit,” he whispered, regarding the sinister face of the “Monk” with a suspicious glance: “You don't mean any foul play? If you do —” he paused and muttered in a vague manner — “The Iron Room! I think you mentioned a place o' that name. Where is it?” “Come with me,” was the answer of Lemuel. “Once in Goodleigh's house, we can quietly arrange the plan of this important affair. Come —” “Had not we better sarch for the tin box afore we leave?” suggested Stewel: “It's somewheres in this room —” “Pooh, pooh! When we obtain the papers in the Iron Room, we will not need either the tin box or its valuable papers. Come — in an hour Goodleigh can be arrested and the proofs of his guilt secured.” “We go sheers, don't we?” suggested Stewel, closing one eye. “That rests with you. Money is not my object. I have an old account to settle with Captain Bradburne. That is all. When he is arrested, you may do what you please with the reward —” “But suppose he makes an attempt to buy off? You said something about that?” `Did I?” the face of Lemuel was agitated by an expression of doubt and wonder; “That must not, cannot be!” He placed his hand upon his forehead — “You must not think of anything of this kind, Stewel. The money, which I will place in your hands, at Goodleigh's house, money which you can pocket without danger, will far exceed any bribe that he can offer you. But we lose time. Let us be going.” He took his broad rimmed hat from the table, and as he turned to the door, his face was reddened by a sudden gleam of the waning light. Every feature was convulsed by emotion. The Corpse also warmed by the sudden flash, into a hideous mockery of life, lay stiff and gaunt before him. “Ann Clark!” he muttered, “When I first saw you, in the home where you supported your aged mother, by the slavery of the needle, I little thought that we would ever part, to meet at last, in a scene like this!” “None o' your nonsense `monk' — move on,” exclaimed Stewel. By the bye hoss, jist explain the mystery o' that Iron Room as we go along.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER NINTEENTH. JOHN CATTERMILL. They left the room together, as the light flared up for the last time. And as he closed the door, Lemuel Gardiner, looked over his shoulder — looked once and for a moment, but with a shudder — at the bed, whereon was stretched the lifeless and distorted form of Ann, the friend of Alice Bayne. Then the door closed, and they descended the stairs, in one darkness. At every step Lemuel whispered the name of Goodleigh, and gave Stewel a hurried description of the Iron Room in Goodleigh's House. Presently they reached the first floor. The Quaker woman and the Millerite's Daughter were waiting there, but a third person had entered upon the scene. It was the wife of John Cattermill, who with haggard face and dishevelled hair, poured forth a broken train of ejaculations, as she pressed her babe against her breast. “O, John, John, how could he go to do it! Jist think of it Ma'am! To turn a thief at his years! I think I shall go crazy.” “What does thee mean?” asked Martha Lott, who gazed upon that troubled face with a look of deep compassion: “Thee has been out in the cold, with but scanty covering. Be calm — and tell me the cause of all this suffering —” “Yes, Nancy, tell her the story, and she will do her best to relieve you,” interrupted a mild voice, and the face of Hannah Marvin, confronted the weeping woman: “What has become of your husband? He left the house, an hour ago — did he not!” At this moment, the form of Stewel, emerged from the stairway door, the visage of Lemuel, scowling from the shadows, behind his broad shoulders. “Lay low, `Monk!”' whispered the Police Officer: “Lay low, and hear something rich.” And standing in the doorway of the staircase, these respectable worthies, listened to the story of Nancy Cattermill: “Why you see Ma'am, a couple of hours ago, when John had got over his fit o' delerious tremens, and was sittin' by the fire, talkin' of Isr'el Bonus, there comes in, a fat man with with a green patch over his eye, and a red face, a very red face — that is as much of it as could be seen.” “That's me,” whispered Stewel to his companion — “Don't she take a pictur' with a rale daguerreotype touch?” “An' this fat man begins to talk with John, and to tell him, what a shame it was that he was so poor. An' then they talked in whispers — I couldn't hear much — but I see'd John's eyes light up, and after a long while heard him say — `I'm your man. For anything I'm your man.' An' then Ma'am they goes out together, John and the fat man with a green patch over one eye. I asks John where he was goin', but he pushed me away, and — O! Is'nt it too bad? Don't you think it is?” She burst into a violent fit of sobbing. “Don't know she's a detainin' the audience,” whispered Stewel, still waiting in the stairway door: “I'd like to know what became o' John arter this.” Martha Lott and Hannah Marvin in vain endeavored to assuage the grief of the wretched woman. Gathering her babe in the tattered shawl, she sank into the only chair — turning her face toward the light, she continued: “An' I waited for John and waited, and waited, O! ever so long, but John did not come back. At last, a while ago, I went out o' the court, and went down the street, and stood at the next corner. It was bitter cold, but I tried to keep my baby warm as well as I could, an' you don't know how bad I felt, as I stood there all alone, thinkin' o' things as they are now, an' o' things as they were last year. O! sich a change!” “A lick of pathos!” whispered Stewel. “Well, thee waited?” said Martha Lott. “Waited there, Ma'am, at the corner of the street, with my baby in my arms, and at last I hear'd a step, and know'd it was John's, and I saw him comin' across the street. `John, where have you been?' says I, springin' toward him, when —” she dropped her babe upon her lap, and wrung her hands — “when two strange men, who had follered John across the street, jumped upon him, and tied him, and took him off in a wagon. They did — and what's worse than all, they said he was a thief — yes, that he'd been robbin' a house in — street. I think they told me the name of the man who owned the house — Goodleigh, I think it was. And they took him off, and he's in Moyamensin' this blessed night. Don't you think it's hard, Ma'am?” Before Martha could reply, the police officer stepped from the doorway, and followed by the converted Monk, approached the light with a measured stride. Stewel's hands were in his pockets, and Stewel's cap was drawn over his eyes, but beneath the leathern frontlet of that cap, his cheeks appeared in all the plenitude of bulk and color. “Folks, I jist thought I'd mention to you, that the lady up stairs has gone out o' this subulnary vale o' tears,” said Stewel, “In other words, she's dead. Did you see anythin' o' that scapegrace boy, Ma'am?” he added, turning to Martha Lott. At the sound of his voice, Nancy Cattermill raised her face, and looked about her with a vague stare. “Did you hear that?” she exclaimed, taking Martha Lott by the hand. “That voice, I mean. It's his voice. The fat man, with the green patch over his eye, who came here, and turned my husband into a thief.” She raised her eyes, and beheld the benevolent face of Stewel Pydgeon. “It's him — I know'd it!” cried Nancy, starting from the chair, with her babe in her arms: “Now, Mister, jist tell us — what did you do with my husband?” “This is a serious charge, friend,” said Martha Lott — “Especially serious when we reflect, that thou art a police officer.” Stewel smiled blandly, smiled throughout his lips and cheeks, even to his eyes, half hidden in bulging lids. “Lord bless you, Ma'am,” he waved his hand with a gesture of great dignity: “It's a way they all have. Every one o' these creturs asks me for her husband. Just as if I carried a pocket-full o' husbands, wherever I go.” “You are a villian!” shrieked Nancy, clenching her hand: “Worse than Isr'el Bonus — that you are” “Da-da-a, folks!” smiled Stewel, as he moved to the door. “Come along my Reverend friend. This society, no doubt, don't agree with your moral wholesome.” He took the arm of the Converted Monk, and hurried him through the front door. “I will see about this, to-morrow,” whispered the Quaker woman, as she laid her hand upon Nancy's shoulder: “Thou shalt have justice. Thy husband shall be cared for. To-morrow, my friend.” Nancy heard the low musical voice. She raised her eyes, and caught the impassioned benevolence of the Quaker woman's countenance. “God bless you!” cried Nancy with a burst of tears. “If there was more Quakers like you, there would not be many sich places as Bonus Court.” A few whispered words passed between Martha Lott and the Carpenter's wife, and then the Quaker woman took Hannah by the hand, and led her silently up the stairs, into the third story. Nancy remained by the decaying fire, hushing her babe as it moaned in its slumber, and fixing her vacant gaze upon the walls of her desolate home. Meanwhile in the third story, the Quaker woman, aided by the Millerite's daughter, performed the last sad offices for the dead. Together they straightened those cramped limbs. They were not afraid of contagion even in its most hideous shape. They smoothed the hair aside from the brow, and closed the eyes, and arranged the body of Ann Clarke, in an attitude of calm repose. It was not without its meaning — that sight which the lamp revealed, as the last hours of the night were fading into day. The daughter of the Millerite, kneeling beside the bed, her hands joined, her eyes uplifted in voiceless prayer. The Quaker woman, gazing upon the face of the dead, her eyes moistened with tears. “O, if men and women, would only leave creeds and forms alone, and attend with all their souls, to those simple words of the Saviour, `Love thy neighbor as thyself.”' This was the muttered ejaculation of the Infidel Quakeress, who derided by all the synagogues of the Orthodox, found peace and religion, in visiting the homes of the desolate — the haunts of the poorest of the poor. Hannah Marvin the daughter of the despised Millerite, said nothing for a long while, but as she remembered the good deeds of the Quaker woman — as she saw that noble face, lighted up by the warmth of a divine humanity — she could not repress an ejaculation, which bubbled from her heart to her lips: “I, also, am an Infidel,” she said, “That is. I had much rather possess your Infidelity, than the Christianity of many Churches.” Martha Lott you will remember, was a Rich Woman. That a Rich Woman should have the heart to feel for the poor, a hand to relieve their manifold miseries, a courage to enter the veriest dens of their wretchedness — all this excited much wonder, in the mind of the Millerite's Daughter. But we must leave the place of death and follow the other persons of our history. The poor woman lies stiff and cold in Bonus Court. Where are the children, whom she has loved with all a mother's love, for seventeen years?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER TWENTIETH. “FI-ER!” Ralph in the streets once more! Barefoot, cold and hungry, he was skulking in a narrow alley, which, gloomy at all times, was now dark as midnight. Far overhead some gleams of moonlight fell upon the icicles along the roofs, but around the wandering outcast all was dark, silent and dreary. He pulled his cap over his matted hair, folded his arms upon his tattered jacket, stood for a moment upon one foot, and then upon the other, but still could not banish the cold, which sent a chill through his tired limbs. “I should like to know where I'm to sleep to-night — I would. If I go home, Stewel 'ill ketch me. If I don't I'll freeze to death. It's a toss-up between Potter's Field and Moyamensin'.” Ralph gazed up and down the narrow court; the shutters were closed, and not a gleam of light, from an upper window, broke the gloom of that desolate haunt. “Where's Fan? I should like to see Fan. Jimminey! Won't she start, when I tell her to-morrow, how rich I am, and what a fortin' I'm heir to! Cuss me, but I wish I had some o' them bright pieces in my pocket jist now! On'y to think of a man o' fortin' like me, not havin' a crust to eat, nor so much as a cellar-door to sleep on!” Running up and down the snow-covered pavement, Ralph endeavored to restore some warmth to his chilled limbs, but in vain. Stopping at last, in very despair, he sank upon a wooden step, muttering as he clenched his hands, this remarkable ejaculation: “I wish the Old State House bell 'ud ring — I do. If there was only the least touch of a fire, the Fairy 'ud come out, and a feller 'ud have a chance to warm hisself. But there ain't no sich luck for me. There's lots o' Carpenter shops a achein' to be burnt and nobody to burn 'em.” In the height of his chagrin, he dashed his cap upon the pavement, at the same time uttering an oath which it is not necessary to repeat. “Wonder if day is ever a-goin' to come? There's a fine pair o' feet to be froze — ain't they? I rather expect, they'll find me in the mornin' layin' along the pavement, froze all over, into a perfec' chunk of ice. Then it 'ill be put into the papers — `'Nother young vaggrant froze hisself out o' spite.' Won't it?” For a moment, reader, surround yourself with the darkness and the cold of this narrow alley, which diverges from the broad street, like a by-path from a highway leading through a lonely forest. Picture the outcast, crouching on the wooden step, his naked feet upon the pavement, his cheeks supported by his bony hands. Then call to mind this solitary fact: But for the crimes of Reuben Gatherwood and Lemuel Gardiner — Doctor and Priest — this savage of city life, would have been surrounded with the light of education and religion. Something like the echo of an approaching footstep struck his ear. Ralph started up, and listened intently, while his heart beat violently against his ragged jacket. “Is it a watchman? It can't be Stewel — hello! There she goes! Ding — dong — boom! The old State House forever! Now for the Fairy! These wild ejaculations, were produced by a very simple circumstance. Deep and echoing, the sound of the State House bell, rolled over the silent city. “F-i-e-r! F-i-e-r! F-i-e-r!” shouted Ralph at the top of his lungs, as he ran along the alley toward the neighboring street. “Give way there boys! Let her drive! Wake her up, Fairy — wake up I s-a-y!” Before the third sound of the bell reaches our ears, Ralph is gone. Poor fellow! Little does he dream, what singular events — events connected with his own history — are now being heralded in every tone of the State House bell!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER TWENTY FIRST. BROTHER CALEB'S DREAM. It is near daybreak, and the moon is shining brightly upon the broad front of Brother Caleb's House. The carriage no longer waits in the shadows on the opposite side of the street. What has become of Lester's hardy friend, who at midnight was watching there, anxious to do the bidding of Ellen's Brother? We cannot tell. All is silent and deserted along the broad street. Brother Caleb's House, with its shutters fast closed, from the first story to the roof, glows in the moonlight, but is silent as the grave. Not a ray streams from a window, to tell us that this mansion is tenanted by a waking soul. What deeds are those, which at the moment are enacting within the walls of Caleb Goodleigh's mansion? We will enter the door, step quietly along the broad entry, ascend the stairs, and pass into Brother Caleb's room on the second floor. A lamp, which stands upon a small mahogany table, sheds its dim light over the curtains of Brother Caleb's bed. Very luxurious curtains, rich crimson in colour, velvet in texture, and spotted with small flowers and bees, embroidered in gold. The light falls upon one side of the bed, but all the rest of the chamber — you may picture its elegant furniture for yourselves — is enveloped in vague twilight. The curtains are parted, and the light shines on Brother Caleb's face. His lean form wrapped in a blue satin dressing gown, he rests upon the coverlet, and turns him in his sleep, as though he was the victim of some troubled dream. His face — whose bronzed hues and bold features are strongly defined against the soft satin of the pillow which supports his head — is turned to the light, and you discover that Brother Caleb is sleeping with his eyes wide open and teeth set firmly together. Brother Caleb's face, with sunken cheeks, wide mouth and thin lips, forehead widening over the brows, and eyes bulging from their lids, does not present a pleasant picture at any time, but now, agitated by the terrors of a dream, and mocked by the very contrast of the silken pillow and velvet curtain, it is as hideous as the phantom of a nightmare. And yet he is sleeping there, the owner of the splendid mansion, like an unsightly kernel, within a rich, luxurious shell. He is so very, very rich. A bachelor, too, with no care of wife or child upon his soul. For him, a thousand, and ten thousand slaves, are waiting ever — not slaves with black faces, and owned by the life-time merely — but slaves of all hues and races, whose services he may purchase with his pieces of gold, and his slips of bank note paper. There is something grand in the idea. Here sleeps a Rich Man who has no care, save that involved in the legal enjoyment of his appetites. His money — how gained, where acquired, is not your business — his money, is but the embodied toil of some ten thousand slaves; the work of ten thousand common people, petrified into bank notes and brick walls. This money would make ten thousand poor men happy. This money would give educa tion to twenty thousand poor men's children. This money, properly applied, would deprive the penitentiary and the gallows of many a victim, and very likely turn every victim into an honest man. But away with thoughts like these. Who talks of depriving Brother Caleb of his — PROPERTY? Property, however won, is defended by Law, and sanctified by Religion. Whatever robbery Property may choose to commit, it is your part to remain silent. But let any ragged wretch, pilfer only one of Property's bank notes, and you shall see, forthwith, that Property is soundly backed by Judge and Penitentiary. One day I saw a crowd of meanly dressed women, holding children by their hands, go sadly up the marble steps of a Bank. That bank had failed, and these women and children were by its failure, deprived of the very means of life. There was no law for the woman and the child; there was no Judge, bold enough to try these robbers of the Bank. Another day, I heard, that some thief — or band of thieves — had stolen seventy thousand dollars, from the President of a bank. At once the whole community was in uproar. The press rung out, the terrible theft, from Maine to the Rio Grande. Judges and juries were ready to try the thieves, and Courts sat week after week, in patient investigation, of the enormous crime. Fifty thousand dollars of the people's money, were spent in recovering seventy thousand dollars, which had been stolen from the Bank. Do you wonder that I compared these two cases? In the first case, a bank had robbed a crowd of women and children of at least one hundred thousand dollars. Other banks, by scores and hundreds, had committed similar robberies. Robberies, not of money merely, but of the very means of subsistence, robberies of life itself. And in these cases there was neither Judge, Jury, nor investigation of any kind. But in the second instance, a Bank had been robbed — robbed of only seventy thousand dollars — and then Judges and Courts awoke, and Juries hungry to be just, sat up day and night, until the Bank, once more received the Stolen Dollars. You need not wonder at the contrast between 8 these cases. The explanation is as clear as a sunbeam. In one case Property was robbed; in the other, it was only Labor. The laws, the courts, the judges, belong to Property. What Labor has on its side, is not often named: it is amply provided, however, with Factory, Almshouse, and Penitentiary. And Brother Caleb was a Rich Man. Is there no music in that name? Rich Man! Rich because others have toiled by night and day, in hot and cold. Rich at all hazards, and in spite of every tie that binds the human heart to God; rich, upon the harvest of the common laborer's suffering; rich, with the price of blood! This may be. Yet he is Rich. That is enough. What a pity it is, for Brother Caleb, that his path covered with gold, must end at last at the same point which terminates the poor man's way, which is only paved with flints and thorns — end at last, at a narrow pit, seven feet long, by eight feet deep! Why is not Brother Caleb immortal? Why must your Rich Men come down to dust and grave worms at last, just like your ragged common people? This question troubles me oftentime. Why does the New Testament speak so terribly of Rich Men? Why does it pronounce the awful sentence of divine wrath upon the usurer, the money changer, and “the Rich Man,” in all his varied shapes? This also causes me much anxiety. Could we not have a Rich Man's edition of the New Testament, with all improper expressions carefully expurgated? Think of it. A Money Changer's Gospel, warranted not to offend any Rich Man in the world, or any Rich Corporation, from the last broken Bank, up to Trinity Church. It is a fine idea; ponder upon it, Preachers and Vestrymen of the Rich Churches. While these thoughts pass over me, I am often forced, against my will, to frame a thought like this: Suppose every poor man in the world, could be removed to some other state of being only for a month, leaving the globe to the care of your Men of Money. What a scene would ensue — just picture it for a moment! Rich Men dining on gold, wearing bank notes, and sleeping upon parchment title deeds — it would be very singular. Trinity Church would find a hard time of it, then. How would it pay its Preachers, and feed its Vestrymen? Could they eat brick walls, and drink ground rents? So, we must be forced to the conclusion: All the comfort, wealth and luxury in the world, is produced by the sinew of labor — labor that is oftentime without a crust to eat or a couch for its repose. And some day perchance — a thousand years hence it may be — this ragged and hungry Labor, may open its eyes and say to Property, certain words, which I dare not write, but which you can easily imagine. But while we are preaching upon the sacred rights of Property; our friend, Brother Caleb, tosses uneasily upon his silken pillow, and turns his writhing features, from side to side. Rich, very rich, he is still afflicted by a hideous dream. This dream divides itself into four scenes, which sometimes appear to his soul as separate pictures, and then melt confusedly into each other, like the colors of a kaleidescope. First, Brother Caleb beholds a brave ship resting upon the waters of a waveless sea, under a burning sky. The sky is without a cloud, the ship is distinctly mirrored in the glassy surface of the becalmed ocean, and the sun, from the very centre of the heavens, pours down a flood of intense, yes, intolerable heat. “My good ship Falcon!” muttered Brother Caleb in his dream. “If we land the cargo at Cuba, we will clear two hundred thousand dollars.” Then from the lower decks, yes from the nooks, and caverns of this gallant Ship, the “cargo” comes crawling into light. For it is a living cargo. It breathes, eats and drinks, and may be sold, for actual dollars. It is composed of three hundred men and women and children, who now throng the deck, and gaze with fevered eyes, upon the fiery sky. But lo! a boat, propelled by oars, and bearing armed men, with the Flag of the Union at the helm, appears on the horizon, within sight of the telescope, and skims silently over the waters. It is many a mile away, but Brother Caleb sees it with his telescope and knows it well. “The boat of that cursed frigate, which has pursued me for days, and which I would have escaped but for this calm.” Thus he murmurs in his dream. The boat comes nearer — what shall Brother Caleb do? Make resistance? The idea is vain, for two-thirds of his men are sick with a plague, engendered by the foul atmosphere of the Slave Ship. Shall Brother Caleb be taken, on board of his good ship Falcon, and arrested as a Slaver, a sort of mercantile Pirate, whose Capital is flesh and blood? Look with your own eyes, and see how Brother Caleb relieves himself from his peril. The negroes are sent below, and then brought forth again, one by one. To the plank with him, to the plank with her, to the plank with every one! Weights of iron and lead are tied to each negro's limbs, and a walk along a plank, followed by a sudden plunge into the still ocean, removes the cargo, from the sight of day. Thus Brother Caleb rids himself of his cargo — men, women, children, all, are quietly put out of sight, under that fervid sky, and beneath the gloomy surface of that waveless sea. “Ho, ho, now let them come,” laughed Brother Caleb in his dream. “Overboard with handcuffs and manacles — overboard with every thing that may even hint the character of our late cargo. Up with the Star-Spangled Banner, and then we'll see who dares to call our good Falcon by the name of Slaver.” This was the first part of Brother Caleb's dream. The light beside the bed shone full upon his cold blue eyes, as his soul became absorbed in the details of a new scene. “Come, Lemuel, we are in Paris, and we will have a quiet game of rouge et noir. This way — up the stairs, my boy — we are in Frascati's saloon. Stake your money, on the red, on the red, my good fellow.” And in his dream, he saw his friend Lemuel Gardiner stake his money on the red, until twenty thousand dollars — the heritage of Annie and Harry Bayne — had passed from Lemuel's hands. “Poor Lem!” mutters Brother Caleb — “So unsuspecting! Little does he dream that ten of the twenty thousand passed into my hands.” In his sleep his chest heaved violently, and he made an effort to raise his hands to his face, but they remained cramped and stiffened by his side. Then came the third part of his dream. A beautiful woman with golden hair and eyes of summer blue. Alone in a darkened chamber, she awaits the coming of Dr. Gatherwood. “Alice Bayne!” mutters brother Caleb, and then pursues this scene to its sequel. It must have been a fearful sequel, for as he dream it over, Brother Caleb's forehead was wet with beaded moisture. The last scene of the dream. Brother Caleb stood at the foot of a stairway, which led upward — far, far upward, into the clouds. It seemed to him, that he was forced to ascend this stairway, whose every step of cold white alabaster, quivered to and fro, like the folds of a curtain. He shrank shuddering from the first step, but an invisible influence urged him onward. In his dream he began to ascend. And as in his dream, he touched the first step of the stairway, he arose from the bed, and clad in the loose dressing gown, took the light from the table. He moves to the door of his chamber, while his eyes are cold and death-like, imagining that at every step across the velvet carpet, he is gaining another step upon the stairway of his dream. He passes into the entry, still asleep, although his limbs possess the power of motion. He begins slowly to ascend that wide stairway of his own mansion, up which he passed with Charles Lester, an hour ago. And while his body ascends the real stairway, his soul is absorbed with the endless stairway, which leads upward, into infinite space. Is it not a strange spectacle? Light in hand, the dressing gown flowing loosely around his gaunt frame, he passes upward, with a noiseless step, at the same time, gazing straight forward with his fixed eyeballs. Following the windings of the stairway, he reaches the third floor, and his light streams in uncertain gleams, upon the entry below. Two figures steal from the shadows — they approach the stairway and look upward toward the light. You recognize the rubicund face of Stewel Pydgeon, and the spare form and harsh features of Lemuel Gardiner, “the Converted Monk.” While the lamp sheds a dim light from the third floor, listen to the hurried conversation of those men: `Who is it Lem? Kin you see his face?” asks Stewel. “Yes — yes — it's Goodleigh,” whispered Lemuel, grasping the bannister of the staircaso. “Awake too, and at this hour!” “Then our cake is all dough,” again said Stewel. Lemuel presses his hand to his forehead, and at that moment the light passes away. “I have not gained entrance into this house, at this hour, for nothing,” says Lemuel with an oath: “Wait here, Stewel. I will go up stairs, and meet him face to face. When I call, you come — will you?” “Yes, my dear,” responded Stewel. “Wait,” whispers the Converted Monk and with that word he stealthily ascends the stairs. As he reaches the top, a sudden light flashes upon his face. He beholds the form of Brother Caleb, as he stands before the door of an apartment, on the third floor. “He goes to the Iron Room,” the thought half escapes Lemuel's lips, and at the very moment Brother Caleb disappears. Cautiously along the entry, steals Lemuel Gardiner. He listens for a moment at the door — all is still — but the light from within streams once more into his face. “I will enter, and meet him face to face,” he mutters, and pushing open the door, enters the apartment. It is the same into which Brother Caleb conducted Charles Lester, an hour ago. Brother Caleb is there. His back toward Lemuel, he holds the light extended in his right hand, and pauses before a narrow door-way, which is sunken in the thickness of the wall. “The door of the Iron Room!” mutters Lemuel. Through that door, you remember, not long ago, Charles Lester disappeared. Lemuel does not pause, although his blood is cold and hot by turns — although his heart leaps to his throat. He glides on tip-toe across the floor, he stands directly behind Brother Caleb, as Brother Caleb is gazing upon the panel of the narrow door. It is a moment of feverish suspense. Clenching his hands, Lemuel surveys the tall form of Goodleigh, awaiting with set teeth and hushed breath, the moment when he shall turn and look into his face. “It rocks, this cursed stairway, but I shall soon gain its summit,” thus Brother Caleb, still asleep, murmurs as he ascends the stairway of his dream. The sound of his voice, breaking so abruptly upon the stillness, penetrates Lemuel at once with the extremity of cowardice and hardihood. He is resolved to dare the worst, although he trembles in every nerve. Brother Caleb turns, and looks into the face of Lemuel, with his glassy eyes. Here, at the entrance of the Iron Room, let us leave them for a little while, and take up the adventures of Charles Lester. It is an hour since he passed that threshold. Let us relate the history of that hour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER TWENTY-SECOND. THE IRON ROOM. Charles Lester, unconscious of threatened evil, passed through the narrow doorway, and surveyed the place, which was disclosed in all its details, by the light of his candle. It was a room or closet not more than six feet square. The walls, the ceiling and the floor were formed by solid panels or plates of iron. There was no window in these iron walls; no other entrance to the closet, than the doorway through which Charles had passed. “It looks like a coffin,” said Charles with a smile, as the flame of his upraised candle, well-nigh touched the ceiling: “It was doubtless built into the thick walls, long ago, as a place of safety for title deeds and gold. But now, there is nothing in the place that I can see, neither chest nor money-bag. Not even a window — yes! upon my word there is an aperture near the ceiling, about a foot square. Does it open in the neighboring closet Goodleigh?” He turned on his heel, surprised by the silence of Goodleigh, and beheld — with what emotions you may imagine — that not only Goodleigh, but also, the secret door had disappeared. The wall before his gaze was composed of iron panels of equal dimensions, reaching from the iron ceiling to the iron floor, but all traces of the secret passage had been suddenly obliterated. Charles slowly paced the narrow space, in which he found himself a prisoner, examining with a careful scrutiny every point of the iron panels, every foot of the iron floor. The only opening in the walls — that aperture twelve inches square, in one corner, and near the ceiling — did not escape his observation. “What does Goodleigh mean? To make me a prisoner in this closet? The idea seems incredible, and yet the man is capable of almost anything in the form of treachery.” He soon became conscious that the candle which he held, began to loose the brightness of its rays, burning dim and faint, as with the pressure of a confined and unwholesome atmosphere. And then his chest began to heave and swell, and an uneasy sensation agitated the muscles of his throat. He cast an affrighted glance over the sombre walls which enclosed him, above, around, and below, as a coffin shuts in the dead. He beat his clenched hand against the panels, seeking with a pallid cheek and brightening eye, the spring or lock which commanded the secret door. Holding the light in one hand, he thrust the other through the square aperture near the ceiling, but it encountered nothing but the air. All his exertions to discover a mode of egress from this “vault above ground,” were in vain. The air became more dense and difficult to breathe. The light, every instant, burned with a fainter lustre. Charles Lester, imprisoned within these iron walls, felt a chill creep through every vein, while his brain swam, as in a deadly vertigo. “Goodleigh! Goodleigh!” he shouted, but the iron ceiling flung back his voice without an echo. “Goodleigh! Release me, and I promise eternal silence.” He spoke with difficulty. There was, of course, no answer to his frenzied exclamations. “Death in any form but this,” he gasped, “But here it seems I am buried alive. And while I am dying here, the poor girl, perchance in the next room, is listening to the voice of Edmund Jervis — listening to the voice, which once spoke Ellen's death-sentence, and which never speaks, save to betray!” Let us draw the veil over the mental agonies of the imprisoned man. No words can depict the horror which palsied his soul while an hour passed away. At the end of the hour, behold him, prostrate on the iron floor, his eyes feverish with despair, uplifted to the solitary aperture near the ceiling. Near his arm stood the candle, its pale light illumining with but a faint glare the surface of the iron panels. Was it the sound of human voices, that reached the ears of the bewildered man? Voices, heard through the aperture, and broken in their distinctness by walls of brick and stone? Was it the voice of Fanny, or the accents of the Preacher, which came faint and murmuring to the leaden ear of Charles Lester? Even as he listened, his consciousness slowly faded from him. He sank on his back, with his hands outspread, and his face toward the ceiling. The dim light glowed faintly upon his pale face, and tinted with faint color the masses of his dark brown hair. Overpowered as much by the disease, which had for months been slowly working at his heart-strings, as by the confined atmosphere of the Iron Room, Charles Lester has laid himself down to die. That disease, solely the result of long continued mental anguish, defies all medical analysis. It kills its victim by slow degrees. What Physicians call it, I cannot tell; but to me it seems to be only the destruction of the body, by the silent action of the soul. The soul, by its will, desires to surrender to earth, its earthborn organization. It wishes to be free: sick of earth, it pants for the pure air of a Better World. And brave Charles Lester, whose life has been wrecked in its youth of hope, by the deliberate crime of a consecrated Minister, has laid himself down to die. His lip moves, his eyes unclose, his hand is stretched forth toward the light, and then he is motionless as stone. The candle sheds only a feeble and dying ray. Meanwhile, in the next room the Preacher is alone with the daughter of Alice Bayne. Not in the room through which Lester reached the closet of Iron. But in the chamber which lies beyond yonder the aperture in the panels. That aperture opens into a closet, and beyond the closet, lies the room which we are about to enter. While Charles Lester is dying, let us slowly lift the curtain from one of the most glorious scenes in the Preacher's life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER TWENTY-THIRD. THE STUDY OF THE PREACHER. Tread lightly, reader, and compose your features into a look of reverence and awe — for we are about to enter the “Study of the Preacher.” In the third story of his mansion, Brother Caleb has set this chamber apart, as the especial haunt of Edmund Jervis. Here, when sick of the world, and eager to escape its crowds of flatterers, the good man may withdraw within himself, and devote an hour to uninterrupted meditation. It is a small chamber, with one door, leading into the entry on the third floor, and two windows, looking into the wide street. Now the windows are closed; the very panes are covered with silken hangings. The walls are covered with a light drapery of faint crimson, spotted with gold and silver flowers. A lamp, shaded by a clouded glass, sheds a rich and softened light through the apartment. That lamp stands upon a desk, which is covered with volumes of sermons, with loosely scattered letters, and with pen, inkstand, and letter-paper. Beside the desk, an opened trunk, packed with fashionable attire, and with disguises, suitable for any adventure which may chance to engage the mind of our Popular Preacher. Amid the heap of fine apparel, a manuscript volume peeps into light, bearing on its first broad page, in the delicate hand-writing of Jervis himself, this significant title—“Memoirs of a Preacher. To be published after my death.” Near the trunk, is a marble dressing-stand, well furnished with all the details of an exquisite's toilette: phials of perfumes, patchoulli, orange, cologne; cakes of scented soap; oil for the Preacher's hair, and cosmetics for the Preacher's skin. A half-dozen of the finest cambric handkerchiefs, carefully laid one upon the other, complete the picture. Look at it as you will, the room with crim son hangings, spotted with gold and silver flowers, is a very comfortable place, in every way adapted, for the more retired devotions of the Popular Preacher. He is sitting in a velvet cushioned chair, near the desk. He has thrown his frock coat aside. A gaily flowered dressing gown floats in loose folds from his shoulders to his slippered feet. A spotless vest, with a rolling collar, clothes his chest, and entwines his slender waist. Resting his elbow on the back of the chair, crossing one leg over the other, in an attitude of careless ease, he gazes intently, yet with a smile, upon the face of the Poor Girl. Opposite, also seated on a velvet cushioned chair, with her hands placed on her knees, and her eyes glassy with the magnetic slumber, behold the unconscious maiden. Does she not look very beautiful, as the mild radiance falls over her warm cheek, and bathes the tresses of her raven hair? Still clad in the velvet boddice, which reaching from the waist to the neck, discloses the outline, while it leaves the entire loveliness of her shape to the imagination: still enveloped in the blue skirt, which flows in loose folds from her waist to her feet, behold the Daughter of Alice Bayne, as her soul is entirely subject to the will of the Popular Preacher. A half an hour may have elapsed, since the good man entered this room. In that time, he has gathered from her lips all the mysteries of her life, which in her waking state, she herself could not know. No longer opposed by the antagonist Will of Charles Lester, he has commanded her soul to traverse every scene of her life, from the hour when Alice her mother sank into death, until the present moment, when she is face to face with Edmund Jervis. He gazes at her, with one of those smiles which make his face look young and even handsome. Listen to his half-spoken soliloquy: “And soh, my pretty one, you are not altogether the child of poverty and shame! A rich man's child — is it so? And your father did not drown himself in the Schuylkill, seventeen years ago? Arthur Bayne lived — fled to the west — took the name of Arthur Baldwin, and became eminent as a Physician. And Arthur Baldwin lived in that town of Prairie-Home, which was also the native place of Ellen Lester. He attended Ellen in her last hours — and to Ellen's Brother confided the secret of his life — of your life, and of your brother's — for it seems you have a brother. Soh, soh, this explains Lester's presence in Philadelphia. He has money — money for you — well, well. I am wearing away, and need the comforts of a home. We will be married Fanny, my child: married my dear. Lester may oppose the match, but there is one way, by which his consent may be forced. Let me place all the strength of circumstances on my side.” Making one or two passes, with both hands, the Preacher soon aroused the girl from her magnetic slumber. Her eyes began to assume their natural lustre. Rosy flushes of warmth gave a new light to her cheek. Her bosom heaved with an even and natural pulsation. After a few moments she started in her chair and looked around with a vague stare, like one who has been suddenly aroused in the depth of a dreamless slumber. “Where am I?” cried Fanny, looking at the hangings, the desk, the lamp, and then surveying her own form, clad in such unusual attire. “Where am I? It is a dream. I am not awake.” “You are awake, my child,” was the kind response of the Preacher: “Awake, and in the care of your friends.” “My mother” — faltered Fanny, raising her hand to her brow, in an effort to recover the control of her memory. “Your mother is well, that is the person who has passed for your mother is well. But my child, you must listen to me. I have a singular revelation to make. A few hours ago, while I was preparing to accompany you to the home of your supposed mother — “My supposed mother!” echoed Fanny. “You fainted, yes, my child, you fainted, whether from anxiety, or from too long exposure to the cold, I cannot tell. I then discovered — it matters not how — that you are the child of a dear and valued friend of mine, who lives out west, in the State of Illinois. I am lately from the west, my dear. I am charged to seek you out, and bring you back to the arms of your father. Instead of being the daughter of the poor woman with whom you have resided, you are the child of the wealthy Dr. Arthur Baldwin, of Prairie-Home, Illinois.” Fanny opened her beautiful dark eyes, in a vague and dreamy stare. “It cannot be so,” she exclaimed — “You are making sport of me —” “It can, and it is, my child,” said the Preacher emphatically, as he drew his chair nearer to the girl: “Seventeen years ago, your father resided in this city. Your mother died, my dear, in the act of giving you life. But mark you, the person whom you call by the name of mother —” “She is my mother, Ann Jones, and my name is Fanny Jones,” exclaimed Fanny, clenching her small hand, as she spoke in a tone of decided emphasis. “This Ann Jones, having an old grudge against your father, stole both you and your brother —” “Ralph,” ejaculated Fanny. “— From the paternal roof. Your father sought for his children for two years, and sought in vain. At last broken-hearted, he went to the west, to die. But he mastered his sorrows, became successful as a Physician, and is at the present time, the wealthiest man in his county. Six months ago, he was informed by a Philadelphian, that Ann Jones was still in existence, and that she lived in an obscure court, with two children, whom she called her own, but whom it was strongly surmised, did not belong to her. I need not tell you that this made the deepest impression on your father. Aware that I was about coming to Philadelphia, he entrusted the management of this matter to me. And to-night, my child, I left you insensible in the care of my good friend Caleb. I hastened to your residence. I listened to the confession of this Ann Jones — she believed it to be her last confession, but she will recover — and from that confession, I derived a knowledge of the truth. You are the child of Arthur Baldwin! To-morrow you leave Philadelphia, on your way to the house of your father! You and your brother, will together journey to the west, under my care. Now, do you understand me, my good child!” Smooth and persuasive were the accents of the Preacher. Fanny heard every word, looking all the time into that face, where honor and sincerity seemed to have made their immoveable stamp. “No! No! I cannot believe it!” she cried, clasping her hands, while her form was agitated in every pulse: “It is a dream — only a dream —” Again the Preacher spoke. Taking her hand he told the story over again, and confirmed its every point, by new and overwhelming evidence. Fanny was forced to believe in spite of herself. She did not swoon with the surprise; but her cheek grew death-like; she swayed to and fro upon her chair, and would have fallen to the floor, had not the Preacher caught her in his arms. “Yes, yes, you shall see your father,” he said, gazing upon her face, which pale and flushed by turns, was bathed in tears. “In less than a month, you shall see him, my child.” He kissed her kindly — perchance warmly — on the lips: “Ralph, your brother, shall go with you —” again he pressed his mouth to her lips — “and this poor Ann Jones shall be forgiven, and cared for.” The Preacher placed her on her chair again, twining his fingers in the waves of her loosened hair — in an absent way of course — as he exclaimed: “To-night you will rest in this house, my dear — to-morrow we begin our journey.” Poor Fanny utterly bewildered, shaded her eyes from the light, and remained for some moments absorbed in thought. Had a thought ever crossed her brain before, that instead of being the child of poverty and want, she was indeed the daughter of respectability and wealth? It is needless to tell you, reader, that the truth of her life, had, in the mouth of the Preacher, been interwoven with a web of intricate falsehood. Arthur Bayne had in reality fled to the west, and risen into eminence as a Physician, under the name of Arthur Baldwin. He had been long convinced of the death of his children, when he received intelligence from an unknown person that Annie and Harry were still living, under the care of Ann Clarke. Before his decease (which took place at Prairie-Home soon after the death of Ellen,) he en trusted Charles Lester with his last Testament, which bequeathed all his real estate, together with fifteen thousand dollars in money, to his lost children, Annie and Harry Bayne. In his dying moments, he besought Charles to hasten to Philadelphia and make search for these children. In case the search proved unsuccessful, Charles Lester would become his heir. The other details connected with this trust, the reader will doubtless gather from the current of our history. From the young girl, while in the magnetic state, the Preacher derived a full knowledge of these facts, which he distorted in order to suit his own purposes. “I will see my father!” whispered Fanny, with an accent of inexpressible rapture as she lifted her eyes to the light, while her face kindled into a warm loveliness, that was hallowed by her tears: “I shall see my father! And Ralph will be removed from the city, from want, from cold, from misery and temptation! O, the news is too good to be true!” Very beautiful was Fanny, as she bent forward in her chair, clasping her hands and raising her streaming eyes to Heaven. “You can't imagine what a beautiful valley of the prairie spreads around your father's home!” The Preacher spoke in his blandest whisper, and with persuasion — eloquence — in his sparkling eyes: “There it stands — I see it now — a white mansion, amid a grove of oaks, with a garden on one side and a wide sweep of lawn on the other. Through the trees you catch a glimpse of the river, and as you wander upon the lawn, the deer, browsing quietly, as though impressed with the peaceful atmosphere of the place, raise their large eyes but do not start and tremble at your tread. And then the flowers, my child, O, you should see the flowers! They clothe the prospect on every side, grouping at the feet of the old trees, starting up from the grass, trembling over the river, until you might imagine yourself in Eden.” Fanny uttered an ejaculation of delight. Beneath the dark boddice her bosom heaved and fell, as with the very fullness of youth and hope. The Preacher surveyed her ardently and continued: “A road passes near your father's house. In a week or so, my child, we will stand at the entrance of your father's place. With you on one arm and Ralph on the other, I will lift the latch of the gate, and enter the walk which winds among the trees, up to your father's door.” “Yes — yes” — gasped Fanny. “He will come forth to meet us! I see him stand upon the porch — his venerable hairs bathed in the morning sun. He beholds you as you draw near. He pauses for a moment in doubt, and then you hear his voice, as he comes trembling to you with outspread arms —`My Daughter! My Son!' And then, ah! then the lost children will find a father and a home!” “Father! Father!” cried Fanny, starting from the chair, as the picture drawn by the Preacher took bodily shape before her eyes. She spread forth her arms as if to clasp her father's neck. Blushing, trembling, panting, she fixed her eyes upon vacancy, as though there, in the twilight of the room, she beheld the mild face of her father smiling welcome to his long lost daughter. “But this is not all —” exclaimed the Preacher, starting to his feet and taking her hand within his own. “This is not all, for —” A slight sound, heard audibly through the profound stillness, interrupted his words. It was very much like the creak of a suddenly opened door. The Preacher turned his head over his shoulder, and as his glance pierced the shadows, a deep ejaculation escaped his lips: “Curse me, why didn't I lock the door.” Frightened at the changed expression of the Preacher's face, Fanny turned as if to gaze upon the cause of his alarm, and in the action fell forward upon his breast. “I've heer'd you talk considerable. Thought I'd drop in and take a look for mesself. How air you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURTH. MAGIC IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. A tall, broad-shouldered form, advanced to the circle of light, as these words pronounced in a gruff bass, penetrated Fanny's ears. Fanny supported by the Preacher's arms, her face upon his bosom, cast a sidelong glance upon the intruder. She beheld a huge, almost gigantic form, attired in a singular costume, composed of a cap of course grey fur, a scarlet great coat ornamented with buttons the size of a dollar, and corduroy pantaloons inserted in the tops of ox-hide boots. Above a plaid neckerchief, appeared a hardy face, tanned by wind and sun, with whiskers white as snow, and eyes brilliant as lighted coals. “I'm sixty years old,” said the Giant: “Heap of rascals I've known in my time. Pour 'em all into a mould and run 'em out into one com-plete scoundrel and yit that scoundrel won't hold a candle to you!” From one pocket the Giant Peter — for it was our old friend — drew forth something very much like a pistol, and from the other, he produced another something, which might have been a gag and which might have been a gridiron. “I've heer'd you. I know you. I say —” his voice growing deeper and hoarser, quivered as with rising rage — “I know'd Ellen!” The Preacher appeared to be much surprised by this intrusion. Scarce conscious that he held the trembling girl in his arms, he looked towards the huge Peter, but did not seem to see him, nor to be conscious of his presence. “Come g-a-l. Come 'long with me,” said Peter, dropping the something which looked like a gag, into his pocket, and extending his brawny hand. “It's a robber,” whispered the Preacher. “No, no, I will not go with you,” cried Fanny, scarce knowing what she said, as she clung to the Preacher's neck. “You won't?” Peter burst into a roar of laughter — “Good that. Tell you he's a scoundrel. Druv Ellen to her grave. Killed her Father. Killed her brother. A devil in a white cravat. Come 'long. I 'spose your Doctor Baldwin's da'ter — Charley told me sutthin' and I heer'd the rest.” “No, no, I will not go with you,” faltered Fanny, clinging yet closer to the Preacher. “You must go with me?” cried Peter, “tell you gal he's been lyin' too. It's his way. 9 Told you Dr. Baldwin was alive. A lie gal. Dr. Baldwin's dead. Been dead this year.” Fanny heard these words, and turning her head over her shoulder, looked into Peter's face, with an expression of vague terror. “My father dead? It cannot be!” She turned to the Preacher, looking into his eyes, her breath fanning his face: “He is not dead! Speak! O, you would not deceive me!” “Your father lives, my child,” whispered the Preacher: “This person knows nothing of you or your family.” Peter seized his pistol by the barrel, as though it were a mace or club. “I give you two minnits to let go the gal and come along with me,” his voice was hoarse with anger, and his eyes shone with a significant expression: “Jist refuse, and I'll tip you over as I would a mad dog.” He drew nearer, and clenched the pistol with a determined grasp. Jervis began to recover from the overwhelming surprise and dismay, occasiond by the sudden intrusion of the giant Peter. A thought flashed through his brain. Could he but carry this thought into action, all his plans might be accomplished without difficulty. “Whar's Lester?” asked Peter; “What have you done with the boy?” “Be seated, my child,” whispered Jervis forcing Fanny into a chair; “Now Sir, I am prepared to listen to you.” Thus speaking, he confronted the giant, gazing steadily into his face, as he inserted his thumbs into the armpits of his white vest. Fanny shuddered as she remarked the contrast between the two. Peter, strong and rugged, his huge form clad in a red overcoat, which displayed the magnitude of his burly chest. The Preacher, slender and diminutive — at least in comparison — his graceful form, enveloped in the folds of a loose dressing gown. One armed not only with a giant's strength, but with a deadly weapon; the other, altogether inferior in strength, and without pistol or weapon of any kind. “W-a-l?” said Peter, with a burst of laughter: “You aint a-goin' to fight, air you?” “You are armed, I am defenceless,” said the Preacher: “You can crush me with superior strength, yes, you can kill me with a sin gle blow of your brawny fist. But that would n't be a coward's deed — would it, my friend?” Peter dropped the pistol into his pocket. “Never use fire-arms to reptyles,” he exclaimed, extending his open hand: “Thar! D'ye see that?” While Fanny, clasping her hands, surveyed the twain, with a look of terror and suspense, the Preacher, still calm, although very pale, devoted every faculty of his soul to the accomplishment of his Thought. “You are a strong man,” he whispered, “and yet you are afraid to let me grasp your hand.” Peter laughed all over his sunburnt face. “I am rather afeerd,” he chuckled, “Thar! Don't hurt me! Please don't, that's a good man.” He extended his brawny hand, which the Preacher clutched in a peculiar manner. “Now is the moment for my thought,” he muttered: “If it fails I am lost.” For a moment, he grasped the brawny hand, without speaking a word, while his eyes, flashing with steady light, were fixed upon the eyes of the giant. Peter regarded him with a grimace of pretended terror — “Don't hurt me if you please!” he said. Fanny, half starting from the chair, watched the issue of the scene, with quivering suspense. “Now, Sir, you are afraid to extend your right arm,” whispered the Preacher, still grasping the left hand of the giant: “Afraid I say!” “Thar it is,” — and Peter quite jocularly, extended his right arm, clenching his fist in the action. “It don't look like gallopin' Consumption — hey?” The Preacher gave a sudden and peculiar pressure to Peter's left hand, and then whispered: “Now if you dare, stretch forth your other arm!” he released the hand, and made a rapid pass, from the giant's temples to his brawny chest. Peter stretched forth his left arm, and clenched his left hand. Thus, with both arms extended, throwing his brawny chest into light, he resembled the figure of a colossal cross. The Preacher stooped and touched him on the knees. Then rising again, he rapidly passed his hands over the arms, breast, and mouth of our good friend Peter. “Now, Sir,” he cried in a voice which swelled deep and bold through the stillness: “You cannot close your arms! You cannot move a foot — You cannot open your mouth! I defy you! You are in my power! Aye, struggle, if you will — it is out of your power to move or speak!” Was this Magic? Starting to her feet in wonder, Fanny beheld the huge form of the giant, standing in the centre of the room, motionless as a figure of stone, save that a slight movement, agitated his closed lips and outstretched arms. “You are in my power! You cannot speak — You cannot move! I defy you to do either! Fanny, my child, look upon this palsied wretch, and behold the power of Heaven!” The Preacher solemnly raised his right hand above his head. “You would steal this child from my care? Speak, if you can! Dr. Baldwin is dead — is he, indeed?” Stiffened in every nerve, palsied in every fibre of his giant frame, Peter stood with outstretched arms, closed lips and clutched hands — stood like a frozen man — without the power of speech or motion. The Preacher, flushed and triumphant, still raised his hand to heaven, and defied the palsied man to speak or move. “It is the hand of Heaven!” gasped Fanny, as she surveyed the strange scene with a feeling of irrepressible terror. “He came hither with a lie on his lips, and the lie has choked his utterance.” The Preacher hastily took his frock-coat from a chair, and in a moment it replaced the dressing-gown. Then placing his hat upon his brown hair, he passed Fanny's arm through his own. “Come, my child,” he whispered, “Heaven has placed this man in our power; let us leave him to the contemplation of his sins!” Alas for Peter! He saw the Preacher and the girl pass before him, but had not the power to move or speak. Turning his head over his shoulder, he gazed into the shadows, and beheld the Preacher in the act of taking the key from the lock, while Fanny was gliding through the opened door-way. And yet Peter stood with arms outstretched and lips sealed, his sinews writhing, his face distorted by his struggles. He saw the Preacher pass through the door-way, saw the door close after him, and the next instant heard the sound of the key turning in the lock. And ere that sound had died upon his ears, the power of speech and motion returned to him, like the gift of a new life. At the same moment, he closed his arms violently upon his chest, started forward as if to test his power over his lower limbs, and opened his mouth to its utmost capacity. “It's the Devil hisself!” shouted Peter, brandishing his arms, and lifting his feet one after the other — “The rale Devil, and no mistake.' He hurried to the door; it was locked; the panels were one solid piece of time-hardened oak, and apparently impenetrable. Peter was a prisoner in the Preacher's study. At the same moment, separated from him by thick walls, and panels of rivetted metal, Charles was dying in the Iron Room, while Caleb and Lemuel stood by its narrow door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIFTH. MAGIC EXPLAINED. You ask the secret of the Preacher's power over the giant frame of the hardy Peter? Was it magic, wizard-craft, or animal magnetism? It was none of these. Magic demands incantations, wizard-craft must work by spells, and animal magnetism can only act when it is favored by a compliant Will. Magnetism thoroughly destroys, for the time, all consciousness through the senses. It is the operation of one Will over another, and can never be accomplished in its important phases, unless the subject yields his will captive to the will of the operator. Yet here in the case of Peter, we have a strong man, in the full possession of his every-day faculties, stricken suddenly into a paralysis of speech and motion, while his Will, more powerful even than the Will of the Preacher, resists with all its force. How shall I explain this? Let us suppose for the moment, that the substance or element called electricity, is the agent by which Mind acts upon Matter, or to speak more plainly, the instrument by which the Brain commands the motion of the Arm and Tongue. Comprehend this in all its phases, and then admit a second supposition. Suppose that you can control the electricity of another person — control it against that person's will — by touching a certain nerve in the hand, the finger, or the arm? This control once obtained, accompanied at the same time by an impression upon the subject's mind does it not follow that all his powers of muscular motion, are, for the time, made prisoner to your pleasure? Thus, the Preacher, inferior in strength and will to our friend Peter, obtained the mastery over his muscular powers, against his will, by controlling the electric force of his organization. Advance a step farther. Admit that the senses do not reside in the tongue, the eye, the ear, the hand, and the nostrils, but in the brain. That brain can only act by electric force. Make an impression then upon the electricity of the brain, and it follows that the subject will see, taste, smell, touch, hear and feel, at your pleasure. These suppositions, which recent discoveries have established as facts, fully explain all the wonders of magic and witchcraft. We have seen, more than one incredulous person who laughed with all his soul at the very mention of these discoveries in science, suddenly confounded into involuntary belief. The unbeliever has been made to taste, hear, see, smell, and feel in accordance to the will of another person. Thus a glass of water, has been changed into acid, into wine, into honey — changed not in reality, but to the taste — by an impression produced by the operator upon the electric force of the subject's brain. We have seen with our eyes, and experienced in our own person, wonders that far exceed the most improbable legends of magic — wonders that appear miraculous and yet cease to be wonders at all, when the secret of their operation is explained by a reference to the unchangeable laws of Nature. Our limits will not permit a complete discussion of the science. But hundreds of persons in Philadelphia and New York, persons of all shades of disposition, temperament and intellect, can testify to the performance of ex periments, in their presence and upon them personally, which mock the powers of belief, and leave the exploits of olden time sorcery, far in the distance. And unlike the history of ancient magic, the cause of these experiments is not made a mystery, nor surrounded with all the display of scenic effect, and theatrical pomp. The cause is known to the persons who witnessed the experiments; and the cause, which we but crudely describe is as simple and as scientific in its explanation as the operations of the law of gravity. The fact that a man like the Preacher, exercised such control upon the physical powers of a giant like Peter, was known to us long before we became acquainted with the cause. Indeed such facts are scattered copiously over the history of all ages. That the Preacher abused the knowledge of the great Truth, is no more an argument against its reality and its benefits to mankind, than his abuse of the Gospel, to purposes the basest, is an argument against the truth and benefits of Revelation. In our history, a knowledge of the great Facts of Electricity, and its Connection with the Brain, is used by a bad man for the accomplishment of a bad end. But this knowledge, properly developed, is capable of the greatest benefit to the human family. By it may be cured, or at least alleviated, one half of the diseases which afflict the human organization. Through its influence, all those diseases, especially, which spring from the Mind, and from the operation of Mind upon Matter, may be swept from the history of human suffering.* * The knowledge of this great science, has lately been developed, in a series of lectures, delivered in New York and Philadelphia, by Dr. John Bovee Dods and the Rev. Theophilus Fiske. In these lectures the science was termed — “Psychcological Electricity.” Thousands of the first citizens of New York and Philadelphia can attest, from their own observation and experience, the apparently miraculous character of these experiments. Not the least important of its benefits, is the fact, that it rears a platform on which Reason and Faith may meet in concord. It crushes scepticism, and not by calling infidel! — but by unrolling the curtain which has for ages concealed those simple and awful Laws by which God governs the Universe — not the Universe of worlds alone, but also the Universe of Immortal Souls. In the Dark Ages, men of learning were doubtless familiar with these great truths. But they were forced by fear of priestly faggot or mob outrage, to cloak them in a veil of scenic mystery. So, in the Dark Ages, Priests of the Church either from fear of man or want of faith in God, cloaked under a drapery of cumbrous mystery the great facts of Religion: That all men are brothers, and God is the Father of all. To do good to men, is to truly worship God. The brotherhood of mankind and the all-paternal character of God, are the vital truths, hidden under all forms of Religion. And then Priests and Learned Men, instead of making Faith and Reason, and Science and Religion meet in concord, took isolated paths, and cursed the world with a barbarous Faith and a mountebank Philosophy. But the day comes, when the heart of the child and the brain of the learned man, will arrive by different paths, at the same great centre: when Reason will be married to Faith: and both Faith and Reason terminate their pilgrimage at the altar of God. Every step in scientific discovery, is also a step gained towards this altar. Two great truths we should gird forever to our hearts: — The Scientific man, whose researches in science do not confirm and enlarge the belief in God and Immortality, is a false Philesopher, who gropes his way every hour far and farther from the throne of God. — The Priest, whose faith does not teach him that God as the Father of all mankind, wishes and will accomplish the salvation of all, is a false Prophet, also groping his way from darkness unto deeper darkness. The false Priest and the false Philosopher, are twin-blasphemers. Their Faith and Reason are alike corrupt. Their teachings are a mockery of Humanity and a denial of God.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIXTH. PETER, FANNY, AND THE PREACHER. “Peter, Peter! You've got yerself into a scrape,” was the remark of the giant as he tried the door: “Preacher and gal both gone, and here you air.” Peter flung himself against the door, kicked its panels with all his might, and wrenched the knob until the sinews started like whip-cords on his iron wrist. All his efforts however were fruitless. Ten minutes elapsed while he was occupied in this manner. “What's become of Charley? If he should happen to meet the Preacher a-goin' down stairs! The reptyle! If I only had a club I'd send them panels into splinters in a minnit. Hello! I've an idea. You're stupid Peter, not to think of it afore.” Drawing a pistol from his pocket, he levelled it deliberately at the lock of the door. His hand was on the trigger, when the key turned in the lock again and the door sprung open. At the same instant the room was filled by a thick cloud of suffocating smoke, which blinded the sight of the giant and forced him to pant for breath. “Save yourself! Save yourself!” cried a voice — “The house is on fire.” Through the cloud Peter beheld the form of the Preacher, with the young girl lying pale and insensible upon his breast. And from the entry, through the opened doorway the smoke continued to roll, in a thick and stifling cloud. The light was suddenly darkened: that dense mass of smoke, illumined by a lurid and hazy light, wrapped the giant, the girl, and the Preacher, in its folds. “To the window,” cried Peter, stumbling forward, “Let's have a breath o' fresh air.” “The windows are nailed shut,” he heard the voice of the Preacher in reply: “Our only hope of escape is —” his voice was broken, as if in the effort to get breath — “is by the roof.” Plunging about in the darkness, Peter encountered the door-way, and with a sudden bound, endeavoured to pass from the threshold to the head of the stairs. But the smoke drove him back. He was blinded and stifled by the dense cloud. Struggling through its folds, he once more found himself in the room, and his extended hand encountered the hand of the Preacher. “You cuss you, don't you know that you'll kill that gal, unless you git the winder open?” he muttered, as he gave the Preacher's hand a wrench, which made him howl with pain — “Wait a minnit! I'll burst the winder open if I have to ram yer head through the sash!” He plunged forward through the gloom, and fell over the Preacher's trunk, at the same moment crushing the lamp with his outstretched hand. “Here we air,” he cried, and raising the trunk with both arms, dashed it at random through the darkness. It chanced to encounter the window, and a sound of crashing glass announced that his effort was in part successful. “I am dying,” moaned a faint voice, which Peter scarcely recognized for the voice of the Preacher — “For God's sake, help! help! help!” Peter felt the shutters, in the darkness. Felt the bolts and bars, which held them close and fast. Again he raised the trunk and hurled it forward, with all the strength of his arms. The shutters started — another blow — they flew open — and Peter starting forward, thrust his head from the window, and at the same instant caught a glimpse of the day-break sky, and inhaled one deep breath of pure air. A strange sight it was to see his red face peeping from the window amid a cloud of thick and inky smoke. At a glance, Peter surveyed the street beneath, and as he looked he saw the burly form of Stewel Pydgeon passing down the marble steps, in the act of emerging from the house, while Stewel's hoarse voice awoke the echoes of the night, with “Fi-er! Fi-er! Fi-er!” But no time was to be lost. Peter turned from the window, and dragged the Preacher from the darkness to the fresh air. In the Preacher's arms lay Fanny, pale and beautiful in her fantastic attire, her face resting on his breast, while her hair streamed over his arms. “Don't kill me — don't —” muttered the Preacher, as in a half swooning state he projected his face from the open window — “I really didn't mean to hurt your feelings.” “You're a purty magician, you are,” gruffly responded Peter. “You can turn a live man into a corpse, but you can't put out a house, when it's a-fire. But let's have a-hold o' th' gal — don't you see she's dyin'?” Lifting the unconscious girl from the arms of the Preacher, Peter grasped her firmly in his stalwart hands, and held her face toward the pure air, while the smoke streamed in a thick cloud, through the aperture of the window. The Preacher meanwhile moaned pitifully — “Why don't they fetch the engines? Don't they know that we'll be burned alive?” “How'd the house get a-fire?” growled Peter, still endeavoring to recover the unconscious girl. “Went down stairs — into second story — was about to light a lamp — smelt fire — opened the door, and was stifled by the smoke — got up stairs with the girl, and managed to find the door of this room.” The Preacher spoke with difficulty, his language vague and almost incoherent, while projecting his neck to its utmost capability, he rested his hands upon the window frame, and endeavored to inhale one long deep breath of fresh air. “Could somebody have turned on the gas and set it a-fire?” muttered Peter, as he shook the form of the girl, in the effort to restore her to consciousness: “But I guess it's been burnin' down stairs, this hour and more, for I smelt smoke when I first came in.” The wind without, blowing fresh and strong, for a moment drove back the smoke into the house. Our friends by the window experienced a sudden relief, and Peter with great satisfaction saw Fanny unclose her dark eyes, as he grasped her in his arms. “Why don't the engines come?” groaned the Preacher, as he turned his face, pale and distracted with affright, toward the giant. “Hark! D'ye hear that? The State House Bell! And that! God bless us, the engines are coming!” His voice fairly shrieked with the violence of his joy. And at this moment, while Fanny gazed around with a vacant glance, there came a sound from the depths of the mansion, which penetrated the Preacher's heart, like the echo of his death-knell. It was the low, deep roaring sound of a vast body of flame, shut up within thick walls. “The house is burnin' away beneath us,” exclaimed Peter. “What is the matter? Where are we?” whispered Fanny, as she turned her gaze from the frightened visage of the Preacher, to the bluff, but imperturbable face of the giant. “We are parficly safe my dear. Just stick your head out o' the winder, and get as many mouth-fulls o' the fresh air as possible.” “They are coming, they are coming!” shouted the Preacher, as the street below, was suddenly illumined with a red glare of torch-light, while the air echoed merrily with the sound of the engine bells. “Don't you see them? They are fixing the hose to the fire-plugs— there! there!” The street echoed to the tramp of busy feet. Crowds of men, half clad, hurried to and fro, by the torch-light glare. The brass ornaments of an engine, flashed back the light, as it was hurled along, by the impulse of an hundred manly arms. The street so lately still as the grave, was now all light, confusion and uproar. “Quick! Quick!” shouted the Preacher, as he stretched forth his arms from the window: “Don't you see that we're burnin' to death: Hall-oo! Murder!” “I see him!” cried Fanny, as far below among the busy crowd, she saw a half-naked form reddened by the torch-light: “It is Ralph!” “Look here you cuss, is there anybody else in the house?” and Peter shook the Preacher roughly by the arm. “Don't trouble me! All my books and papers, all my clothes will be turned into cinders! Why don't they bring a ladder? Hall-oo!” But Peter was not thus to be denied. Clenching the Preacher with his vice-like grasp, he repeated his question, with a slight addition in the way of rhetoric: “Anybody else in this house? Give us an answer, or out you go from this winder, by —!” “There's a man in the entry,” gasped the Preacher: “I stumbled over him as I came along.” “Take the gal, you cowardly vagabon',” cried Peter, and ere the Preacher could manifest his astonishment by an ejaculation, the giant had disappeared. He had plunged once more into the cloud of smoke. Our history now returns to Brother Caleb and the Converted Monk. They stood at the door of the Iron Room, at least fifteen minutes before the Preacher was driven back to his “Study,” by the fire and smoke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVENTH. BROTHER CALEB REACHES THE TOP OF THE STAIRWAY. Brother Caleb, holding the light above his head, turned slowly round, and gazed upon Lemuel with his cold fixed eyeballs. That gaze penetrated Lemuel with the very extremity of fright and terror. The luxurious folds of the dressing gown, which clothed Brother Caleb's gaunt form, only increased by contrast, the hideousness of his unearthly countenance. “You can't scarce me, Gatherwood,” whispers Lemuel through his set teeth, as his form trembles with the desperation of cowardice: “The time has gone by for that kind of thing.” “Another step, and I will reach the top of this cursed stairway!” murmurs Brother Caleb, still absorbed by the adventure of his dream. His rigid face, motionless eyeballs, and slowly muttered words, suddenly strike the “Converted Monk” with an impression of the truth. “A Somnambulist!” the thought only half escapes his lips. “Walks in his sleep, does he? I'll wake him up, when I have the proofs of his guilt in my hands. Go on, my dear Gatherwood!” Bowing with much gravity, Lemuel uttered these closing words, with a grimace, accompanied by a burst of half suppressed laughter. Brother Caleb, still asleep, was of course unconscious of his presence. Turning, he touched the spring of the narrow door. It opened, and light in hand, he crossed the threshold, imagining that he had won another step on the stairway of his dream. Lemuel stealthily creeping at his heels, followed him across the threshold, into the Room. And Lemuel, with all his soul absorbed in the contemplation of the movements of Brother Caleb, did not observe a prostrate form which was stretched upon the iron floor. His own shadow added to the shadow of Brother Caleb, completely veiled the prostrate form from observation. Nor did Lemuel, watching with an unchanging glance, the movements of Brother Caleb, behold the haggard face, which slowly uprose from the shadows, gazing around with a dull vacant gaze. It was the face of Charles Lester, who aroused from his deathlike stupor, by the current of fresh air, slowly raised his head, and beheld the motionless form of Brother Caleb, standing gaunt and erect, in the centre of the Iron Room. And near Brother Caleb, Charles beheld the slight figure of the “Converted Monk,” crouching behind the gaunt form, like some noxious reptile, about to dart upon its unconscious prey. Charles slowly rose to his feet. But half conscious, and impelled by an influence which it is in vain to analyze, he crossed the narrow space which separated him from the door-way. Lemuel heard the sound of his step, and turned to him, suddenly whispering, “Go back, Stewel!” but ere his words were uttered, Charles had crossed the threshold, and closed the narrow door. Lemuel still believing that it was Stewel's footstep that had disturbed his silent watch, turned again, and watched with flaming eyes the motions of his friend Gatherwood, otherwise known as Brother Caleb. “No! No! You will not drive me back!” groaned Brother Caleb, in a tone of acute agony: “Do not hurl me from this dreadful height! Extend your hand — only for a moment — and I will be saved!” Brother Caleb had attained the last step of that stairway, leading into the clouds, when there — upon the summit, amid white folds of waving mist — appeared the figure of Alice Bayne. There was a smile upon her beautiful face, and her golden hair waved freely to her uncovered shoulders. But even as Brother Caleb's foot touched the last step, the stairway began to rock with a frightful motion. He reached forth his arm, and attempted to clutch her hand, but that hand evaded his grasp, while the face of the beautiful woman was agitated by a look of calm mockery. Brother Caleb cast his eyes below — the awful height made him dizzy. Thousands and ten of thousands of fathoms of space, lay between him and the solid earth. And Alice could save him — save him by the single extension of her hand — but Alice smiled in calm mockery, while she murmured in a calm musical voice, these words: “Dr. Gatherwood, my home was happy before you passed its threshold! Give back my home, my husband, and my children, and then I will help you to ascend the stairway!” And while the stairway rocked like a reed in the blast, Alice shook her golden hair, from the summit, and taunted the poor wretch with the history of his crimes. — Such was the course of Brother Caleb's dream, as he stood in the centre of the Iron Room, with the keen eyes of Lemuel Gardiner fixed upon his rigid face. “Alice! Thee must forgive me!” cried Brother Caleb, relapsing into the dialect of his youth: “Thee will not refuse to aid me! Mercy, Alice, mercy upon me, or I will fall —” Brother Caleb strode madly forward, thinking that he was gaining the last step of the dream-stairway, and Brother Caleb pitched violently against the iron wall of the Iron Room. With cold sweat upon his forehead, he awoke. You may imagine his surprise, when the reality succeeded to his dream. The form of Alice, and the dizzy stairway had passed away. He found himself in the Iron Room, with the eyes of Lemuel Gardiner gazing into his own. Lemuel, with his narrow figure contracted into the smallest possible compass, crouched in one corner of the closet, his head sunken on his breast, his chin resting on his hands, pressed nervously against each other. And thus Lemuel's eyes, looking upward from the shadow of his compressed brows, imparted a singular, almost ghostly character to his visage, covered by a close-fitting skull-cap. And Lemuel did not move — not even for an instant change in the slightest degree, his statue-like position in the corner. Lemuel looked for all the world like some mischievous animal, of the lower order of the feline race, which, while in pursuit of its victim, has been suddenly confronted by a more aristocratic beast of greater capacity for carnage and destruction. Very much like a cat, abruptly cornered by a tiger, looked Lemuel, the “Converted Monk.” “What does this all mean?” said Brother Caleb after a long pause. His projecting eyeballs began to lose their vague and glassy aspect. There was some trace of “Captain Bradburne of the Falcon” in their glance. Lemuel preserved his fixed attitude, but did not reply. “I have not seen you these three months,” resumed Brother Caleb, holding the light above his head, while he took a more attentive survey of Lemuel's face: “Yes, it's three — possibly four months. What are you doing here, in my house? Is this a `Chrismas Play' to amuse the children?” Brother Caleb smiled with his imperceptible lips; a sort of cadaverous smile, which only deepened the hollows of his cheeks, while it gave a sudden lustre to his eyes. And Lemuel, crouching in the corner, saw the smile — felt it too, in every pore of his slender frame — and still had not a word in answer. Brother Caleb was wrapped in thought. Placing the finger of his unoccupied hand, between his brows, he seemed earnestly engaged in an effort, to recollect distinctly, the events of the past four hours. “I have been walking in my sleep,” he exclaimed, “and have wandered from my bed to this room. The Iron Room! Eh! Where's Lester? Did you see anything of Lester?” A miracle! Lemuel so glib in speech, when acting in the character of a “Converted Monk,” is now silent as the President of a Broken Bank, when questioned concerning the causes of its failure. “Who told you of this place?” cried Brother Caleb folding his blue gown about his spare limbs: “How came you into my house at this hour? How dared you, Sir, to follow me to the Iron Room?” Then Lemuel speaking in a bland and whispering voice, as he joined his hands, while his face assumed a look of mock-gravity, uttered this simple exclamation: “O, Reuben!” Now Brother Caleb had not heard that name for many years. Pronounced by his associate in the crimes of seventeen years ago, it struck harshly upon his ear, and with the memory of his late dream still pressing heavily upon his brain, it sounded like an accent uttered by some mocking Demon, from the shadows of a dark and guilty Past. The very audacity of this Lemuel — this despised dupe and tool of former years — penetrated Goodleigh with an impression of involuntary fear. “You have set yourself upon my track. You have spied out the secret of this house. You have even discovered the secret of this room. Since the moment, now three months ago, when I scorned you in the street, and refused you the charity of a single dollar, you have dogged me, like — like —” he paused for a word — “like the common eaves-dropper and vulgar busy-body that you are. And now you have joined hands with this Lester — is it so?” While Brother Caleb thus poured forth this torrent of incoherent reproach, “the Converted Monk” maintained his fixed position in the corner, as silent as the iron walls against which he leaned his crouching form. “Is it so? You have some petty plot working in your craven brain? How much must I pay for your silence? You have made some discovery — eh? Have succeeded in identifying Caleb Goodleigh, with Captain Bradburne of the Falcon? Ho — ho! Lemuel, you grow amusing in your old days.” “This night,” said Lemuel, speaking very low, his chin still resting on his clenched hands: “This night, I witnessed the death of Ann Clarke.” Goodleigh started — a convulsive motion of his features was perceptible — but in an instant he recovered his grim composure. “Did you?” he blandly replied: “Said she anything of that child — the pledge of your early loves?” Lemuel Gardiner was a despicable coward. All his life had been devoted to despicable and cowardly deeds. Through seventeen years of baseness, he had slimed his way with a devotion to the smallest details of depravity, worthy of one of those vulgar fiends, which make you laugh and shudder, in the pages of some grotesque German story. But all his baseness, rich at first in money, had at last left him — poor — miserably poor. He was now, at the age of forty-seven — to a casual gazer he O1 seemed not more than thirty — a desolate and blasted man. Virtue he could not understand; it was one of the incomprehensible words in the Dictionary to him. But Poverty was a word that conveyed an intelligible, a palpable idea to his dwarfed soul. Poverty sounded in his ears, as Leprosy sounded in the ears of the ancient Hebrews. And he was poor — poor after seventeen years of perjury, trick, and fraud — while Reuben Gatherwood, his old-time associate, stood before him in all the plenitude of Real Estate and Bank Deposits. He was poor; forced to get his bread by pandering a nightly stimulant to the appetite of bigotry, in the shape of “No-Popery Lectures,” to drag his weary way through the tortuous details of small hypocrisies, and pettier hatreds, while Reuben Gatherwood the Apostate Physician and blaspheming Slaver, was the Lord of half a million dollars. Lemuel had been thinking of all this, for three long months. Churning it over, while he wandered dark streets, at dead of night, and digesting it in his very soul, as he threaded through the crowd of Chesnut street by day. And Lemuel had long resolved upon revenge. He did not hate Caleb because he was bad; only because he was the Rich Scoundrel. Resolved upon revenge, in what form he had not determined, Lemuel had spied out the secret of Goodleigh's connection with the Falcon, or rather spied out a clue to the proof necessary for Goodleigh's conviction, before a Court of Justice, for the identity of Goodleigh with Captain Bradburne had been known to Lemuel for many years. This was the state of affairs with him, when Ralph summoned him from the Church of St. John — where he had wandered under the influence of some lingering trace of early belief — to the bedside of the dying woman. But his interview with Ann Clarke had altogether changed the current of his ideas. It had left upon him a shadow of overwhelming despair. Perchance his brain, long fitted for the reception of mental disease, had suddenly been seized with that most terrible form of insanity, known as Monomania. There is a monomania which makes the veriest coward brave. A purpose of revenge, nursed in the very core of the heart for weary days and nights — nursed in dreams and elaborated slowly in the hours of waking hatred — may at last ripen into the two-fold idea of Suicide and Murder. Did this two-fold idea impart to Lemuel Gardiner the courage to confront the man whom he feared; feared supremely, and from the depths of his coward nature? Let us await the issue of the scene. “Said she anything of your child — the pledge of your early loves?” “Yes,” replied Lemuel, “and something of Alice Bayne, the victim of your cowardly outrage.” “Do you know that I've a mind to strangle you?” Caleb's voice was hoarse with suppressed rage. He advanced threateningly, but Lemuel still crouched motionless in the corner. “Have you? Hush!” Lemuel's voice sounded like the accent of a woman who endeavours to still a boisterous child: “Hush! Reuben! The Police Officers may hear you. They wait without.” Brother Caleb recoiled, as though a blow from a strong man had stricken him in the chest. “Have you dared?” he whispered, “Cur! Why I could beat your brains against these walls — beat out the miserable heart which rots in your living body — and leave you here, in this room, which in that case, should be your only coffin. Who would ever hear of your death? That door once closed, and your carcass would be shut up in darkness forever.” Lemuel advanced from the corner. His lean shrunken figure dilated in its every fibre. “The door is closed,” he said in a whisper, and with a singular smile. Caleb turned on his heel, and at a glance, saw that the door of the Iron Room was indeed closed. Closed so tightly and effectually that it was not distinguishable from the iron walls. And then Brother Caleb gave utterance to a frightful oath, for — he knew not the secret of the spring which opened the door from the inside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHTH. THE INSIDE SPRING. “When you bought the house, you were informed of the existence of the Iron Room,” said Lemuel, remarking the changed countenance of Caleb with calm satisfaction: “The original owner built it with a particular object. He wished to secure his title deeds and his hoarded gold. Therefore — Reuben are you listening? He procured the services of a celebrated Locksmith. He had the door constructed in such a manner, that it opened and shut with a secret spring. The burglar might possibly discover the spring on the outside, but once within the Iron Room, it was imposible to discover either the door, or the spring which opened it from the inside. You have heard these facts before?” Brother Caleb raised his hand to his forehead — it was wet with beaded moisture. The lamp quivered as he held it above his colorless face. “You may remember that a burglar once stole into this Room, while the `original proprietor' was absent from the city. He — the proprietor — was absent for two weeks. When he returned he visited this `patent safety chest' and found the burglar's dead body, stretched among piles of mortgages, and heaps of boxes, filled with specie. Did you hear of it?” Again he paused, but it was now Caleb's turn to be silent. “The secret of the `inside spring' died with the former owner of the house,” resumed Lemuel. “When you bought the property (Israel Bonus was the Conveyancer I believe?) you were duly informed of the `outside spring' but at the same time, told that the secret of the `inside spring' (excuse this reptition, Reuben) was lost forever. Do you remember?” It seemed indeed as if the power of speech had passed from Caleb Goodleigh, as the sound of Lemuel's voice penetrated his ears. Frightfully pale, and shaking as with an aguefit, he gazed toward the place where he supposed the door to be, with a vague yet earnest look. “Lemuel,” he whispered, after a long pause: “There is no need of any quarrel between us. Let us go down stairs, and settle our dispute over a bottle of wine. You know the secret of that door — eh?” “When I came to your house to-night, it was in company with a Police Officer,” resumed Lemuel: “It was then my purpose to procure proofs of your guilt, and have you arrested in your bed. I left the Police Officer on the first floor, while I went through the apartments, in the wing of your mansion. I was absent from his side only a few moments, and when I came back, no change in my countenance belied the nature of my occupation, during this absence. He little dreamt, poor fellow! that I had torn your splendid carpet from the floor, and arrayed your furniture in a pyramid, and then set your Painted Chamber in a blaze!” Goodleigh's face was agitated by a horrible distortion. “By —! You are mad! You could not think of such an infernal deed!” “No worse than setting fire to a ship filled with three hundred negroes, when a United States Frigate is in sight, and your boat under the stern. Eh, Goodleigh?” “Come — you are raving!” said Brother Caleb, wiping the sweat from his forehead. “I did this, not fifteen minutes ago, and then joining the police officer, came up stairs, in order to ascertain whether you were fast asleep. Lemuel's eyes blazed in the sunken sockets, while his lips parted in a grimace — a grimace that was the very extravagance of mockery. “This is a jest, Lemuel,” said Caleb, gnashing his teeth — “a jest for which you will pay dearly —” “For which both of us will pay dearly,” interrupted the “Converted Monk” — “But as I reached the head of the stairs, I saw you emerge from your room. I followed you, and not until you reached the threshold of this closet, did I discover that you were walking in your sleep. Then the mere idea of burning your house, with the chance of burning its owner with it, was displaced by a much better thought —” “A much better thought?” echoed Goodleigh, while the hand which held the lamp began to droop slowly from its raised position. “I thought of the `inside spring' of the Iron Room. And from this thought arose a kindred idea, which I put to myself in the form of a question — `What if Dr. Reuben Gatherwood should enter the Iron Room, enter it in his sleep, and only awake to find himself shut up in an Iron Coffin — an Iron Coffin enveloped in the flames of blazing rafters?' It was a fine question, Reuben — can you answer it?” The speaker stretched forth his arms, in the very earnestness of his mockery, while his eyes, that seemed to burn in their sockets, assumed a wild and singular expression. Brother Caleb at the same instant became conscious of two facts, which promised to have a decided influence upon the course of his life. He was alone with a madman. It needed not his medical lore to tell him that. The eyes blazing in their sockets, the lips distorted by a grimace, and whitened by an almost imperceptible foam, the outstretched arms swaying vaguely in the air — conveyed a language which Brother Caleb could not misunderstand. And this was only the first fact of which he became suddenly conscious. Looking over his shoulder, Brother Caleb saw a slight cloud of smoke, issuing from the aperture near the ceiling. “The house is in flames, and I am alone with a madman!” This was the thought which Brother Caleb deduced from the two important truths just mentioned. Could he tame the madman by threats, by promises, or by the magnetic power of the eye? That strange power which the eye of a sane man, has over the mind of the Insane? Brother Caleb was so Rich — so very, very Rich — and Lemuel Gardiner so Poor — so miserably Poor! And Brother Caleb must die in an Iron Coffin, heated red hot by the flames of his burning mansion, die with a madman's yell in his ears, die a death such as had never befallen the leprous negro, in the infernal history of the Slave Trade! There was no time to be lost. The thin line of smoke, issuing through the aperture, began to thicken rapidly into a cloud. This coffin-like room, whose atmosphere was close and oppressive at all times, began to grow uncomfortably warm. The air began to heat. “Lem, my good fellow, the joke has been carried far enough,” as he spoke, in a tone of good-fellowship, he raised the lamp, with a firmer hand, and surveyed the face of the “Converted Monk”: “You know the secret of the inside spring. Open the door and let us begone. Once outside and —” “You will give me a dollar, for char-i-ty's sake — won't ye?” said Lemuel in a subdued voice. “Hark! These walls are thick, but you can hear the State House bell. By this time Reuben, the wing of your big mansion is provided with a plumage of flames. Good figure that? Hark! Do you hear a sound, like the tread of a large crowd? Hundreds of people are in front of your doors, Reuben, but not one of them — not one among ten thousand — can release you from this room.” Caleb cast an uneasy glance toward the aperture. The cloud of smoke was increasing rapidly. The atmosphere of the Iron Room, grew warmer every moment. And a deep roaring sound, like the echo of a vast furnace, throbbed at intervals, upon the ear of the affrighted man. “Let us go!” shrieked Caleb, now fairly wild with terror, as the big drops of moisture coursed down his hollow cheeks: “I swear to you that I will forget the past. You shall be rich, rich I say! I will divide my wealth — I swear it!” “He talks of riches and of wealth, who in less than an hour, will be nothing but a heap of cindered bones!” said Lemuel in a low voice, as though communing with himself. “Madman I defy you!” cried Brother Caleb, fixing his gaze, with sudden intensity upon the visage of Lemuel: “Why need I beseech, when with a look I can disarm your madness! My eye is upon you. You know it. You cannot move but at my bidding. Ha, ha, have I mastered you?” Indeed Lemuel shrank from that fixed gaze, which was imbued with peculiar magnetic power. He shrank, and turned his body away, but his eyes he could not remove from Brother Caleb's face. Was the mind of Goodleigh about to triumph over the will of the Madman? Lemuel seemed to have become in a moment, the victim of an intolerable physical and mental agony. He trembled violently, and the foam grew thicker and whiter, over his lips. Turning his body from side to side, at pleasure, he could not remove his eyes from the burning fascination of Caleb's gaze. “Come! Open that door — I command you!” exclaimed Brother Caleb, while his projecting eyeballs, emitted flames of magnetic light: “You are in my power. I command you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINTH. “A LITTLE PRIVATE CONVERSATION.” Lemuel began to move along the iron floor, slowly, almost imperceptibly, and without raising his feet. Not for an instant did he remove his gaze from Caleb's face. He was chained to Caleb's eyes, as by the power of an irresistible magnetism. “To the door! Discover the secret spring! I command you!” Brother Caleb dared not turn away his eyes from Lemuel's face. That steady gaze, one instant changed, and all was lost. But he felt the air was growing warmer every moment, and the smoke issuing from the aperture, now began to flow like a misty veil before his face. Gliding, shuffling over the floor, Lemuel approached the wall, where it was supposed the secret door was concealed. His features were terribly agitated; he was gathering all the force of his Will, in order to combat the fascination of Goodleigh's gaze. Halting abruptly, he flung his body backward, while his feet moved as if in opposition to his will. And as he struggled with that gaze, as a man would wrestle with an enemy, arm to arm and breast to breast, Brother Caleb drew nearer, until the lamp which he held came within the reach of Lemuel's uplifted arm. The face of Caleb was bathed in moisture. His eyes flashed with a sinister, malignant lustre. “You dare not disobey!” he said, and — Lemuel's struggling arm, dashed the lamp from his hand. They were alone in the Iron Room, alone in the darkness, enveloped in the stifling atmosphere, as in a shroud of heat and smoke. The power of Caleb's gaze was gone; and a burst of mocking laughter which seemed to resound from the very heart of Lemuel, told Caleb that the hour of the madman's vengeance was at hand. “Ha! Ha! This atmosphere grows comfortably warm. How do you like it Reuben?” “Devil!” gasped Caleb through his grating teeth. “You can hear the State House bell? Hark! to the sound of the firemen's tread as they are hurrying along the street. But they cannot save you Caleb. No! No! N-o-o!” Caleb uttered a howl of despair and plunged in the direction of his enemy's voice, but Lemuel slid like a snake from his outstretched arms. “When I stood upon the threshold, I thought to myself, that it would be better for me to obtain the proofs of your guilt before I had you arrested. But I changed my mind, Reuben, changed my mind — d' ye hear? I will not arrest you; I want no proofs of your guilt. I only want” — another burst of laughter — “the opportunity of a little private conversation with you.” “This place stifles me,” groaned Caleb — “I can scarcely breathe. By Satan it is only a horrible nightmare. Lemuel! Lemuel! Relieve me from this place, and name your price. I am rich — rich” — “And you must die the death of a leprous negro in a burning ship,” whispered Lemuel in his ear. “I have riches scattered over all the world. Release me, and I will share with you! You have heard of my plantation in the West Indies? A beautiful place that stretches from the sea-shore, adorned with everything that can please a man of pleasure. Beautiful slaves — they are mine — cellars filled all with old wine — a voluptuous atmosphere — days and nights of sensual pleasure. These — these I offer you as the price of my life! Quick, Lemuel, quick, I say! There is no time to be lost!” “You grow poetical, Reuben,” was the only reply that resounded from the darkness: “Strike a more practical vein. Somehow I like the sound of your voice.” “Do you desire money? Long condemned to poverty, you shall taste the enjoyment of money for money's sake. You shall become a Capitalist. You shall have the control of half my fortune. Think of it Lemuel! As a man of money, you can revenge the insults received in a lifetime of poverty, you can command” — “The twenty thousand dollars of which you robbed me, at rouge et noir in the good city of Paris. Eh, Reuben?” That roaring sound, which throbbed through the burning mansion, was now heard with appalling distinctness. Faster and thicker poured the smoke through the aperture in the iron walls. The heat became intolerable. Caleb groaned in anguish: he heard the sound of bells and trampling feet, and shouting voices, all subdued and deadened by thick walls, and every sound penetrated his heart like his funeral knell. “Will no one save me!” he shrieked — “Must I die in this cursed place?” “I burn! I burn!” answered the voice of Lemuel — “These iron plates are heating. Reuben, Reuben I say” — “You relent — you will discover the secret spring?” There was silence, only interrupted by that dull, roaring sound. Lemuel roused from his monomania by the near prospect of an appalling death, had indeed relented. The madness which had seized him, after his entrance into the iron room, now suddenly passed away. He started from his frenzy, like a man roused abruptly from a horrible dream. “Search for the spring. Reuben,” he cried in a changed voice — “Years ago, the secret of that spring was communicated to me by the lock-smith, on his death-bed. In his last hour, he repented that he had made the lock, for the death of the burglar weighed heavy on his soul” — “The spring!” shrieked Caleb, “Where is it? Do you not feel that we are burning alive?” “A small iron knob projects from the iron panel. It is about half-way between the ceiling and the floor.” In the darkness, they began to search for the iron knob. While the atmosphere grew more dense, Caleb and Lemuel placed their hands upon the iron panels, already warming under the influence of the fire, and with the eagerness of despair sought for the inside spring.' They passed around the narrow room, in opposite directions, and met again, their hands pressed upon the iron panel, touching in the darkness. “I cannot find it,” groaned Lemuel — “We shall be burned alive —” “Dog! This is your work?” hissed Caleb through his set teeth: “You will share my fate. We shall die together. Ho, ho, friend Lemuel are you caught in your own trap —” “But I am not rich,” whispered Lemuel. Goodleigh mad with rage, sprung toward him in the darkness. Lemuel avoided his grasp, and Goodleigh stumbled and fell upon the iron floor. A sensation of intolerable heat, pervaded his frame, as he came in contact with the heated panels. “I would give ten years of my life, to have you in my grasp,” he shrieked, as he staggered to his feet. “You had better think of your misdeeds, Reuben,” answered Lemuel — “Think of Ann Clarke who was innocent, until you crossed my path, and made her the Murderess of her own child” — “And you, now that you are about to die, shut up in flames, you my good Lemuel, think of the Church whose rites you have blasphemed, whose vows you have broken. Think of that life of forty years, which is marked in its every moment, by the tricks of a craven and a swindler —” “Think of Alice Bayne! You are silent — have I touched you? Ah, cowardly knave! Did not your heart fail you, when you stole into that peaceful home, and under the cloak of your profession, damned the purity of a mother, drove the father to suicide, and sent the children adrift upon the world? Did you ever feel remorse good Reuben?” “I did not creep to the bed of a dying woman, and under the cloak of a Preacher's frock, extort from her fears a will that made her children beggars. Indeed I did not. That was reserved for a `Converted Monk.”' “But you robbed this Preacher of the inheritance of the children — robbed him at the gambling table — at the very moment, when he was about to return to America, and surrender his ill-gotten wealth. Do you remember Frascati's?” “Is there no way of escape?” groaned Caleb in a changed voice. “Ah! This is a horrible death!” He gasped for breath, and staggered over the floor, while his temples throbbed with an intolerable torture. The roaring sound grew more distinct. It drowned the tramp of the thousands who hurried along the street, and enveloped the iron room on every side. Panting for breath, his lungs oppressed by the stifling air, the sinews of his throat writhing under a sense of suffocation, his brain fevered and his temples throbbing with acute agony, Brother Caleb felt that his consciousness was rapidly passing away, that he was sinking fast into that stupor which terminates only in Eternity. He began to utter incoherent oaths and imprecations of despair, as he staggered over the heated floor. “Alice! I defy you! You shall not drag me down! A ship in sight, did you say? Ho, ho, we'll foil them! Into the sea with our living cargo — overboard with them all! Wash the stain of blood from the decks, and let hand-cuff and manacle follow the negroes, into the sea. For the sea is silent — it tells no tales! How much did you say I was worth? Half a million? A great deal of money! Change it into gold, gold, d'ye hear? Let me see it all in gold. Let me bathe in it, let me swim in it, for with gold a man can move the world. Curses upon the knaves! This gold is heated — it withers the flesh from my fingers as I grasp it!” Staggering to and fro, Brother Caleb at last, encountered the form of Lemuel. Lemuel was on his knees, muttering as he gasped for breath, a prayer of the Catholic Church. They grappled together, and fought in the darkness, Caleb endeavoring to dash the head of Lemuel against the heated wall, while Lemuel clinging to him, with maniac strength, sunk his teeth into Caleb's shoulder. Their curses died half-uttered on their lips. Suffocating with the intolerable heat, they lost the power and coherence of audible speech. It was a fearful struggle which they maintained in the darkness, in that Iron Room, enveloped in a whirlpool of flame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRTIETH. THE BRAVERY OF THE PREACHER. Our narrative once more retraces its steps, and resumes the adventures of the other characters of this history. “They're bringin' a ladder! Look! Look! They're bringin' a ladder! Don't you see 'em!” Wild with fright, the Preacher bent from the window. Reaching forth his arms he surveyed the thousand faces which were upraised in the glare of the blazing house. Fanny by his side, in her gay attire, with her hands joined and her black hair floating over his shoulders, fixed her gaze upon a single form in the crowd, whom her eye singled out among a thousand. Poor Ralph! While the engines worked by sturdy arms were playing upon the roof, while the smoke and flame rolling into the sky together, alternately illumined and darkened the scene, he stood on the edge of the pavement half naked and barefoot, with his eyes raised to the window in the third story. He had secured a plug for the Fairy, and now leaving the Fairy Boys to work the engine, he leaned against a tree-box and made his voice heard above the clamor of the crowd: “Durn my riggin! There's a gal up yander! A live gal! Why don't you fetch a ladder! And a man too! Moses! — how he shakes his neck and wriggles his hands!” Presently a ladder was brought, and after much hoarse shouting and rugged motion, it was raised and placed against the window in the third story. “Save the gal!” shouted twenty rough voices, and twenty fellows in scarlet shirts leaped to the ladder with one bound. But Ralph was before them. No sooner had the top of the ladder touched the window sill than his naked feet were upon its rounds, and his hardy visage lifted upward, and reddened by the glare, gazed with its large grey eyes, upon the face of the woman far above, as he ascended with the agility of a monkey in search of cocoa-nuts. “Go it Jonesey!” shouted a score of voices — “Save the gal or bust yer b'iler!” Fanny gazing from the window beheld her brother's face as he rapidly ascended. Peter when he left the room, had closed the door — whether by design or accident we cannot tell — and for a while, the place was free from smoke, although the flames from the wing of the mansion, were every instant rolling nearer to the main building. She breathed freely, but the uproar, the sky reddened with flame, the echo of falling timber, and the shouts from the thronged street, filled her with a terror that can be readily imagined. But Ralph was coming — he was half way up the ladder — he would save her. Fanny uttered a loud shriek of joy. The Preacher darting into the shadows, secured some articles which he took from his trunk within his white vest, and placed the MSS. of his life, entitled “Memoirs of a Preacher,” in the pocket of his dressing gown. Darting to the light again, insane with terror and incapable of thinking of anything but the safety of his precious life, he began to creep from the window. His feet touched the rounds of the ladder. Turning his face, distorted by his panic, over his shoulder he began to descend. “You are not going to leave me?” cried Fanny. He did not seem to hear her; but a thousand eyes uplifted from the street, beheld this illustration of his gallantry and courage. Beheld the Preacher descending, while the face of the girl looked from the window. But Ralph was rapidly ascending. In a moment after the Preacher left the window Ralph's hand encountered his right foot. “Go back you cuss,” he shouted, pinching the Preacher in the calf of his leg — “Into the winder agin, or I'll chuck you overboard.” “Don't! Don't!” cried Jervis — “Let me go. The house is on fire —” “O' cou'se it is” answered Ralph, converting his head into a battering ram, and urging the Preacher upward again — “Keep movin' my superfine feller! My name's Jonesey and I al'ays goes in for burnin' a chap like you, into small pieces. Will you get into the winder or shall I chuck you over?” The Preacher looked below — his fears increased the distance between himself and the pavement — he began to grow dizzy. But Ralph, conscious that the eyes of the Fairy Boys were upon him, propelled the Preacher gently upward, by using his head as a battering ram, and the Preacher's delicate person as the object of attack. Comprehending this manoeuvre, you will not be surpised to learn, that the Preacher soon reached the window, and entered it again by a movement which would have gained him great applause in any respectable Circus. To be brief, he plunged head under heels into the window. “Hello! What's this!” cried Ralph as he reached the top of the ladder and found himself face to face with his sister — “May I be turned into a Snapper if you don't look like our Fan!” “It is Fan, yes it is Ralph,” answered the girl flinging her arms about her brother's neck — “O, I am so glad you're come!” “Don't doubt it! But what do you mean dressin' yerself like a play-actor?” cried Ralph gazing with big eyes at the changed attire of his sister — “Have you found any rich relations, an' did they set their house a-fire, for joy, at seein' you?” But Fanny with a firm hand and courageous heart, had already ascended upon the window sill, and placed one foot upon the ladder. She was a brave girl. Her life of neglect and want had given her presence of mind and firmness of nerve. “Go down, Ralph,” she said, “when we are safe I'll tell you all. Go down — I can take care of myself — only do you keep my frock from blowing in the wind.” “You look like a rale super at the theater,” cried Ralph, beginning his descent, as with one hand placed upon his sister's dress, he steadied her movements: “Don't look below, Fan, and we're safe!” The wind lifted the masses of her dark hair, and the glare of the flame, showed her form, in distinct relief, as assisted by her vagabond brother, she slowly descended the ladder. “Take kear Jonesey!” shouted a Fairy Boy from below. And the spectators of the conflagration, held their breath with suspense, as they beheld the form of the girl, descending the ladder, her rich attire contrasted strongly with the ragged apparel of the outcast Ralph. Fanny was half way down the ladder before the Preacher recovered from his acrobatic movement through the window. Gathering himself up again, he placed his hands upon the sill, and beheld the face of Fanny uplifted, with the reflection of the fire, giving a wilder beauty to every feature. “I must not loose the girl,” he murmured, and crawled out upon the window sill, when a strong arm, dragged him back again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIRST. STEWEL HAS HOPES OF THE TIN BOX. Peter stood before him, holding the form of an insensible man in his arms. Peter rushing from the smoke and flames of the entry, had closed the door again, and dragged his burden toward the window. “It's Lester,” faltered the Preacher, as he beheld the pallid face of the insensible man. “To be sure it is, an' I found him thar in the smoke! An' when I found him he wanted to jump down the stairs into the fire, and so I had to knock him, jist to bring him to reason. Arter us is manners!” Throwing the form of the insensible Lester over his shoulders, he emerged from the window, and began to descend the ladder. “You are not going to leave me?” shrieked the Preacher, “I tell you I can't get down myself, I'm sick — I haven't strength. The fire has reached the entry — I'll be burned alive —” “What's the odds!” shouted Peter, lifting his ruddy visage toward the affrighted man, who projected his head from the window —“If you can't use your hands an' feet you'll have to burn.” The Preacher, whose terrors, long agitated by glimpses of hope, now left him trembling and powerless, leaned against the window, his teeth chattering and his hands shaking as they grasped the sill. “I can't get down, I tell you I c-a-n-t!” he shrieked. Peter with his insensible burden on his shoulders, was now on a level with the second story. At the same moment, Fanny and Ralph had reached the pavement, amid the cheers of the spectators. “Wait a minnit and I'll come up for you!” cried Peter, “You deserve a good burnin' but I'll let that be postponed to a futur' occasion!” “Quick! Quick! I hear the fire in the entry!” and as his voice was borne away by the wind, the spectators beheld his pallid face and outstretched arms. For two or three minutes the wretched man endured all the tortures of a thousand deaths. He heard the roaring of the flame, as it swept from the wing to the main edifice of the man sion — he felt the heat which despite the open window, was fast becoming insupportable — and it seemed to his craven soul, that his heart as it knocked against his ribs, was only the sound of a death-watch, announcing his approaching hour. “He's nearly down the ladder! Why don't he hurry? It's horrible — burned alive, burned alive and at my age! He means to leave me here — I know it, I know it! Curse me, why have not I strength to descend the ladder myself? Hah! He's down, he's down! He's giving Lester into the arms of those men, and there's the girl, too — all safe, all safe! And I'm up here, burning alive” — The eyes of the wretched man fairly started from their sockets. Grasping the window, with both hands, he bent forward, and traversed the extent of the ladder with a madman's gaze. “He's coming, he's coming?” screamed the Preacher, as he caught a glimpse of the scarlet coat — “Quick! Quick! If I once get out o' this I'll be a better man, indeed I will!” Peter is indeed upon the ladder once more — Peter is ascending rapidly — and Peter reaches the window, at the same moment that the fire bursts from the roof above, in one vivid and dazzling sheet of flame. “Come!” and the Preacher reached forth both arms. Peter seized him, as though he had been a bundle of goods. “Be quiet and don't kick or I'll drap you —” he whispered, as he slowly descended. At this moment, the pipe of the Fairy directed towards the roof, poured in one steady column full upon the head of the Preacher. In an instant he was saturated from head to foot. “Murder!” he shouted, scarce knowing what to make of this last calamity — “Fire!” “Be quiet, can't you,” whispered Peter, and as he spoke the flames rushed in a torrent from the third story window. “Look thar!” Raising his dripping face, the Preacher beheld the sheeted mass, and was blinded even as he gazed, by a sudden cloud of smoke, which whirled along the front of this mansion, burying himself and Peter in its folds. “Hold me tight,” he gasped in agony — 11 “Don't let me drop! If I'm safe out o' this, I'll be a better man!” “O, you will?” growled Peter —“I reckon so! Till you run off with somebody's wife or murder somebody's darter? Hey?” In a few moments, half dead with affright, wet to the skin, and shivering in every nerve, the Preacher was placed upon his feet, at the foot of the ladder. The instant that his feet touched the ground, he seemed to recover his presence of mind. Gazing around the crowd, he beheld the ragged Ralph standing beside his sister, near the foot of the ladder, while Lester was in the arms of a stout citizen who was endeavoring to restore him to consciousness by dashing water into his face. And as he looked around, Fanny rushed eagerly toward him, holding Ralph by the hand, while the giant Peter turned to the insensible Lester, and assisted the stout citizen in the effort to restore him from his death-like swoon. “This is Ralph — this is my brother,” said Fanny. A deep bass voice resounding from the very foot of the ladder, for a moment drew the attention of the spectators from the face of the beautiful girl. “Gentlemen! This is a free country,” said the deep bass voice, and the portly form of Stewel Pydgeon was revealed by the torch light — “An' I don't hold it to be the correct thing, to let a man burn to death in a free country.” “Where's any body burnin' to death?” cried a Fireman, who was busy at a fire-plug which stood in front of the burning mansion — “Where is he? Say? Don't you see we're gettin' the fire under, old hoss? There's more chance o' yer friend bein' drowned than burnt by a long chalk.” “He's in that house, an' he's my friend,” cried Stewel, in great excitement — “An' I've got a warrant for him in my pocket! I should like to know if the ends o' justice are to be evaded in this way? A man goin' and burnin' hisself to death when I've got a warrant in my pocket for him?” Singular to relate, these words of Stewel, pronounced with much eloquence of gesture and an emphasis of the deepest bass, only elicited a roar of laughter from the surrounding crowd. “I say Stewel, I'd get a habe's corpus on him,” suggested the fireman at the plug — “That'll fetch him sure!” But a new object of interest had attracted Stewel's gaze. He beheld the Preacher in his dressing gown, with Fanny on one side, and the half-naked Outcast on the other. “Goodleigh's gone — but the tin box is sure!” cried Stewel, grasping Ralph by the collar. “Come along Jonesey — that tin box my dear!” And Ralph who had been listening to the whispered words of the Preacher, started as if he had been aroused in the midst of a dream, and found himself in the hands of Stewel Pydgeon. “What has my brother done to you?” cried Fanny. “Why do you seize the young man by the throat?” exclaimed the Preacher laying his hand on Stewel's arm. “What's that your business? I say my buck you'll have to come along. The tin box is safe if Goodleigh has gone and burnt hisself to death.” He tightened his grasp upon the collar of the young man, and began to drag him roughly along the pavement. Ralph at first thunderstricken by the apparition of Stewel, now regarded him steadily, surveying his rubicund face with flashing eyes. “Jist let go a-me,” he said — “Or I'll be apt to raise the Fairy on you.” As he said this, Lester stretched in the arms of Peter, at the foot of the tree-box, unclosed his eyes. He beheld with the first glance of consciousness, the face of Fanny and the visage of the Preacher. At the sight, the blood coursed through his veins once more. He sprang from the arms of Caleb and rushed toward the Preacher. “Fairy boys to yer work, to yer work I say!” — cried Ralph, and Stewel under the influence of a clenched fist, which Ralph had planted between his eyes, fell back upon Lester, and Lester unprepared for this shock, fell once more into the arms of Peter. “You're a fugitive from justice!” shouted Stewel, as soon as he recovered himself. “Gentlemen I call upon you to assist me in arrestin' this desperate villain!” He looked around for Ralph, but Ralph had disappeared. “It is Jervis,” whispered Lester as he released himself from the arms of Peter, “Jervis and the daughter of Alice Bayne.” Rushing by the portly form of Stewel, Lester looked eagerly around in search of the Preacher and the girl, but Jervis and Fanny had also disappeared. Lester and Stewel formed the centre of a compact group, who regarded their movements with a burst of laughter. “He shall not escape me!” shouted Lester, as the light streamed on his uncovered head and colorless visage, “I will pursue him to the end of the earth” — He attempted to force his way through the crowd, but the crowd presenting a compact front, forced him back upon the portly form of the Police Officer: “This is an attempt to resist the Law!” shouted Stewel in a rage — “I know you gentlemen! I've got all your names! You may laugh, but to-morrow, Judge Choktaw 'ill hear o' this” — The crowd seemed to be impressed with the idea that Lester and Stewel were alike functionaries of the law, and therefore they resisted all their attempts to pursue the fugitives. Peter came quietly to Lester's side — but at this moment, a scene took place, which entirely changed the surface of affairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRTY-SECOND. A FIREMAN'S FIGHT. “A fight! A fight!” resounded from the opposite side of the street, and in a moment the engines ceased to play, while the glare of the burning house revealed the faces of a dense crowd, tossed to and fro, in inextricable confusion. It was a Fireman's fight. Before we gaze upon the features of this exciting scene, let us lightly sketch a few prominent characteristics of the Philadelphia Fireman. A mysterious character is the Fireman of the Quaker City. At the sound of the Bell, he starts from his slumber, and hurries forth but half clad, eager to battle with the flames, and save the property of the rich man from destruction. He calls no hour of the twenty-four his own. He has no hearing but for the sound of the fire-bell. His only idea ef motion is an engine or hose carriage, hurled along the streets, by the impulse of vigorous arms. Music to him is only found in the brass horn, through which the voice of the engineer rings in hoarse emphasis, exclaiming “Give way!” “Let her drive!” or “Wake up Snappers!” or “Here we are Hornets!” or some expression of similar eloquence and rough Saxon energy. Happy is the Fireman who “carries the horn!” The Horn is the climax of your incipient fireman's idea of glory. “To carry the Horn” in the thought of the Fireman, is as important and as glorious, as twenty-five per cent in good paper, is to the Third Street Broker. The Engine or Hose Carriage is the centre of all the fireman's thoughts. He lives in the life of “the machine” — a new-fangled term lately introduced from New York, and not recognized by Orthodox Firemen. Her frontis-piece, the amount of polish of which her brass is capable, the height which she plays, and the speed with which she runs — these are the only topics which occupy the attention of the true Fireman. The soldier goes to battle in a gay uniform, and faces death for pay or for glory. The Fireman battles with flames, with falling rafters, with the chances of disease, and very often the certainty of an untimely death, and battles always without pay, very often without a word of thanks. His only glory is in action; he seems to be possessed with a monomania that forces him to devote time, health, strength — very often life — to the good of other people, who too often call him a ruffian and a blackguard, by way of recompense. The Knights of old were divided into classes, ranks, and orders. So are the Modern Knights: the Firemen of the Quaker City. There is the Fireman Dandy who sports white kids on Chesnut street, and yet is always ready to tear them off at the first tap of the State House Bell. This Fireman belongs to an aristocratic company, composed of staid citizens and gentlemen of the counting-house. They have a great supper once a year, and rather pride themselves upon their elegant equipments, the long established name of their company, the respectable standing of their members, to say nothing of the neat little back room in their Engine House, where no cigar is smoked that does not breathe Havana in every puff. Then there is the Fireman Hero who delights in the poetry of epithet, and always has a feud on hand, with some rival company. The very manner in which he dresses has something formidable to the unsuspecting. Hair very short behind the ears, and very long and shiny before them; hat with wide round rim, pitched significantly on one side of the head, and brought down very sharply upon one eyebrow; shirt of red flannel, adorned with a broach of the size of a dollar, representing some event in the Fireman's life, or perchance the figure of a horn done in silver, or yet again merely the initials of his company's name. Like the Knights of old, the Fireman Hero affects the poetry of epithet. True he does not call himself the Knight of the Burning Brand, or the Knight of the Silver Fountain, nor even the Knight of the Golden Horn. His titles have a vigorous old-fashioned Saxon significancy. He is a Snapper, or a Hornet, or a Tartar — or in his more dangerous moods — a Fairy. A Fairy six feet high, in a white overcoat trimmed with horn buttons, and with corduroy pantaloons inserted into the tops of unpolished boots, would be something of a novelty to the minds of those ignorant persons, who have derived their ideas of Fairies, and Fairy life, from books. There are also the Rancheroes of the great Firemen army, who skulking on the outskirts of the camp, take to themselves such fearful names as Bouncers, Rats, Killers, Screw-Drivers and Blue Injins. These do not belong to the army of Firemen any more than the camp followers belong to an army of disciplined soldiers. They are the real guerrilereroes of the Fire Department. Terrible are they with brick-bats on a Sunday afternoon: formidable are they, with paving stones, on a dark night, when the number of the enemy, is as one to twenty. Fearful are they in noises — noises of all kinds — very hoarse always — and sometimes very drunken. They practice the Indian war-whoop in their leisure hours. They prepare themselves for the arduous work of battle, by a severe training around piles of brick, and heaps of paving stones. They are eloquent swearers. The number of times, when they confirm their statement, by invoking fierce condemnation, upon their eyes and livers, cannot be estimated by any known Arithmetic. The true Firemen looks upon these Rancheroes with especial disfavour. As the Newfoundland Dog endures much from an ill-grained Cur, with defective eyes and scanty tail, so the real Firemen suffers much and suffers in silence, from the annoyances of the Ranchero. But as the Newfoundland dog sometimes drops his senerity, and seizes the cur by the neck, and shakes him at first gently, and then with justifiable violence, so the real Firemen, at times, is tempted to tap the Ranchero with his closed hand, and even to adorn the Ranchero's eyes with touches of a rich mezzotinto shadow. To do the real Firemen the most scanty justice, we must record the fact, that he does more work for less pay, braves death oftener for less glory, than any other member of the the community. Your shrewd money-making citizen, who never does a favor without a direct return in the shape of coin, looks upon the Fireman with an overflowing fullness of contempt. Very often he rewards the Fireman by insinuating in conversation or in the papers, that he only extinguishes flames which he himself has created. He rewards the Fireman for his thankless sacrifice of self by calling him an Incendiary. A just man and a grateful, is your sagacious citizen. Battles have often been described, that is battles fought with cannon and bayonet, but what pen shall dare attempt the description of a Fireman's Fight? The time midnight, or very often the small hours, near the break of day. The combatants some six hundred men, blocked up amid a mass of spectators, whose faces are reddened by the light of a blazing house. The weapons, fists, horns, spanners, bricks, clubs, and paving stones. The cause — a hose has been discourteously trodden upon, or a plug has been taken away, or a Snapper in the heat of debate has spoken irreverently of a Hornet. Then the war-cry resounds along the crowded street. Then, over dripping paving stones, and around glittering engines, and along sidewalks slippery with mire, swells the tide of war. You see a mass of heads, arms, fists, horns, feet and bodies, wind into a knot, and unwind again, to the sound of “Go it Snappers!” and “Ha-a! Ha-a! Tartars!” The air, by turns, darkened with cinders and red with the glare of blazing roofs, grows thick with brick-bats and paving stones, all on the wing, and doing fierce work, on eyes and crowns. The wounded fall, only to rise in more savage wrath. The fight grows miscellaneous: anybody can procure a broken head, without the least trouble. All along the curbstones, droop weary warriors with bended heads and bleeding noses. The uninitiated who desire a definite idea of a scene like this, have only to remember that fine old Legend of the Cats of Kilkenny, or to imagine the Halls of Congress on the last night of the session. A faint idea may be obtained in this way. A battle like this, was now in progress, in front of the burning mansion. How this fight originated, after a careful search into the most recondite branches of history, we are unable distinctly to relate. But certain it is, that just as the fire was beginning to yield to the combined attacks of half a dozen engines, in front of the mansion, and four in the rear, that the war-cry rose, and the combat began. In a moment hose and engine pipes were dropped. The crowd began to roll and toss, in a huge wave of heads and arms. Little knots of firemen were fighting along the curbstone, while in the centre of the street, swelled the concentrated fury of the war. Then through the uproar might be heard the war-shouts of the rival clans. Wake her up Snappers! was answered by Hey! Hornets! hey! Go it Fairies! was mingled with Now's your time Tartars! and Let 'em have it Injins! was greeted by the stern response, To your duty Rats! Horns were freely used. Brick-bats began to hurtle through the stormy air. Along the extent of an entire square, rolled the tide of battle, mingling the combatants and spectators, into one inextricable mass of heads and fists, over which distinctly rose the figures of the engines, glittering in the flame, like islands in a stormy sea. Stewel Pydgeon, Charles Lester and the giant Peter, collected in a group, in front of the burning house, surveyed the field of battle, with various emotions. “Gen'elmen respect the law,” cried Stewel, in a voice of thunder — but alas! a blow from some unknown fist, which shot suddenly around the corner of the tree-box, brought Stewel to his knees. And a second blow, administered freely on the back of the neck, made Stewel kiss the bricks. Thus was the Law, brought to shame, in the person of one of its most respectable Ministers. Peter, in his red coat, surveyed the scene, not precisely with eyes like saucers, but with eyes very large, and very full of vague astonishment. “What air they fightin' about? How they rap one another! They're they go! Why don't they stand up two by two and fight it out like men, instead o' mixin' 'emselves up like a basket o' black cats?” “Come — let us make our way through the crowd,” cried Lester seizing Peter's arm: “The Preacher disappeared in this direction. Come, I say. Unless we pursue him now, he will escape us altogether.” Peter did not remark the pallid cheek and flashing eye of his young friend. Peter, gazing into the centre of the combat, beheld a solitary man, fighting alone, against a crowd of twenty. Dressed in a red shirt, with the blood flowing freely from his battered face, this lonely warrior, was attempting to defend his engine, from the assault of twenty foes. His brothers in arms were fighting in another part of the contest. By the chance of war, he was left alone, near the Engine of his company, which the twenty had resolved to deface if not destroy. But he kept up the fight right heartily. “Tell yer I'm one of de Fairy boys,” he shouted as he fought through his foes — “Yer don't smash dis engine. No yer don't. I keeps a graveyard of my own, jist to bury my dead. I keeps two Coroners and a depitty busy all the year round. Go it Fairy! You never know'd I was brought up to the business —did yer?” Tossing into the crowd of his enemies, the Fairy distributed his blows with a high-toned impartiality, that soon littered the paving stones, with wounded and bleeding warriors. Five of the enemy measured their length upon the ground. But others rallied. Adding new fire to their fury, by frequent shouts, they rushed upon the solitary Fairy, and bore him upon his knees. He, fighting as he fell, continued to converse with his tongue and fists. “I'm a Fairy — I am!” he shouted gallantly as a hail-storm of fists, descended upon his unprotected head. At this crisis Peter beheld the scene. And Peter, with a bound reached the centre of the fray, and interposed his giant form, arrayed in the scarlet overcoat, between the Fairy and his ensanguined foes. “You mus'nt crowd. It ain't perlite. Besides I never like to see twenty wolves upon one dog.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRTY-THIRD. PETER BECOMES A FAIRY. With these words expressed without the least appearance of heat, Peter raised his right arm, and showed his right hand, high over the heads of the combatants. “Jist strike this man agin,” he cried, “and you'll find me thar!” Surprised for a moment by this apparition, the combatants presently recovered their presence of mind. “Go way old man, this is a private fight —” “Sarve him out! Give a horn over his top-knot —” “Hey! Hey! Down with him, down with 'em both —” “He's a Fairy — let him have it —” And accordingly one of the combatants, struck Peter in the breast, just as the solitary Fairy, protected for a moment by his intervention, was rising from his knees. `Come, children you better go home and let your mammies spank you and put you to bed.” With these paternal remarks, Peter described a circle with his right hand, followed by a circle with his left, at the same time projecting his right foot with sudden and rapid force. “Lord! how the old hoss mows 'em down!” ejaculated the admiring Fairy. It was indeed true. Peter in sober verity had “mowed 'em down.” He went through them, with great composure, using his hands and feet at the same instant, and littering the ground with the forms of the Fairy's enemies. Two alone resisted his progress, making desperate battle, over the heaps of their wounded comrades, but Peter seized them by the neck, and knocked their heads together, until they dropt like ripe apples to the ground. “Where did you larn it, hoss?” cried the admiring Fairy, seizing Peter's hand — “Jist larn me how to mow — do.” But there was not much time for conversation. The battle which had been raging in the middle of the street, now rolled toward the sidewalk, and entangled Peter and “the Fairy boy” in its vortex. Fifty other Fairies were battling with as many of Crocodiles. They fought around the Engine, and Peter much against his will, was forced to strike right and left, in order to save himself from being trampled under foot. Soon the Rats, the Bouncers, the Blue Injins, and the Snappers, joined the fray, and the Hornets came hurrying to the ranks of war. It was no longer a fight of feuds, a war of clans, but a promiscuous battle, in which every one struck his neighbor without regard “to party or creed.” Peter mingled in the broil, and fought like a buffalo at bay. Charles Lester, gazing from the sidewalk beheld the scene, as an hundred faces streaming blood were illuminated by the glare of the burning house. Soon he lost sight of Peter. He then made his way as best he might in the direction taken by the Preacher and the girl. The day was breaking, and the fight was raging, when a sound like the thunder of an hundred cannon, drowned the yells of the combatants, and made every one start, as though a magazine of gunpowder had exploded near his feet. The cause of this sound merits an explanation. While the fight was in progress, the fire, which had been slowly yielding to the force of the engines, blazed up with increased vigor. One by one, the windows of the mansion, from the second story to the roof gave out a torrent of flame. The roof itself was one mass of fire — fire that shot up into the canopy of smoke in long and tremulous flames. The western wing of the mansion was on fire from foundation to roof, and the wind swept the flames to the main building with the force and thunder of a tropical hurricane. Far over the city flashed the light of the burning mansion, far over the wilderness of roofs and the waters of the Delaware, spread that vast volume of smoke, reddened in every fold, until it resembled an immense pall tinged with blood. And the State House Bell never ceased to strike. Toll, toll, toll — it rung as though it was pealing a funeral knell. The battle in the street, and the flames of Brother Caleb's house, raged together. The startled denizens of Drab Row, alarmed for their safety, were projecting their heads from every window, and from the houses immediately adjoining Goodleigh's, crowds of half clad men and women, and heaps of costly furniture, began to stream in an unceasing torrent. And the fire burning fiercely on, had long enveloped the Iron Room in a shroud of flame. At last the timbers beneath the Iron Room gave way, and the huge mass plunged with a horrible crash into the depths of the fiery whirlpool. As it fell, crashing from floor to floor, the fire was suddenly darkened. A volume of inky smoke rose from the depths of the mansion, and then the sky was strown with countless sparks, glittering through the darkness like a meteoric shower. It was the fall of the Iron Room, which had produced the sound resembling the combined thunder of an hundred cannon. It was the darkness which followed this awful sound, that brought the combatants to a pause, and sent a thrill through the nerves of a thousand infuriated men. The Iron Room had fallen. Where now is Goodleigh and the Converted Monk? The darkness did not last long. The flames rushed once more into the sky, as though the fall of the Iron Room had only deadened their fury for a moment. The street was once more bright as noonday. It was no longer Goodleigh's house that was threatened, but the mansions of the entire square. A voice was heard through the death-like stillness, which had descended upon the crowded street. Giant Peter mounted upon the “Fairy” engine, with the marks of the late combat on his face, seized a trumpet and made himself heard along the entire square: “Put out the fire, boys,” he shouted, “An let's fight arterwards.” The suggestion was received with cheers. In a moment engines and firemen were at their work again. Separate columns of water were playing upon the roofs of Drab Row. Mounting to the roofs, nine sturdy firemen, with hose pipes in their hands, poured as many torrents into the abyss of Goodleigh's house. Snappers, Hornets, Crocodiles, Bouncers, Blue Injins and Tartars, buried their feuds for awhile, and with all might of fire-plugs and engines, went to work sturdily to accomplish the salvation of Drab Row. And Peter, high on the Fairy Engine, was working with the Fairies, his giant form rising and bending, as he continued to encourage them with the oft-repeated remark— “Put out the fire boys, an' arterwards we can lick one another like blazes” When the sun arose, Drab Row was saved. But Goodleigh's house was a mass of blackened ruins. The walls alone remained, begrimed with smoke and dripping with water. Floors, windows, doors, everything but the brick walls had been consumed by the flames. And buried beneath masses of smouldering timber, the Iron Room, rested in the depths of the cellar, its panels still joined together, but heated red hot by the surrounding fire. Descending from the “Fairy” as the sun shone over his scarred and blackened face, Peter cast his eyes over the crowd, who thronged the sidewalk, blackened with cinders, and piled with heaps of damaged and broken furniture: “Where's Lester?” he ejaculated aloud. “Where's Goodleigh?” cried a stout gentleman near his side: “That's the question.” It was Stewel Pydgeon, who stood on the curbstone, gazing toward the walls of the house, whose desolate windows, still gave passage to clouds of inky smoke. “What do I know of Goodleigh?” answered Peter, surveying the Police officer, with a vague stare. `Don't be affronted Sir,” replied Stewel with a saddened air — “I had a warrant for him, but he's gone and burnt hisself to death, in that cussed house. That's all. But I have some feelin's and a thing like this never happened to me afore.” It was not until the close of the day, that the fire which smouldered in the depths of the ruined mansion, yielded to the combined force of a half a dozen engines. Stewel, anxious to discover some trace of Goodleigh, hovered all day, near the blackened walls. More than once he determined to descend into the cellar, and search among the smouldering timbers for the body of Goodleigh. Of course no idea of Goodleigh's wealth buried in the ruins ever entered Stewel's brain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOURTH. “A BLUE PARTY.” Peter sought for Lester, and found him in his room, No. 92 of the — Hotel. Stretched upon his bed, he raved with a madman's look and voice, about the Preacher, the daughter of Alice Bayne, and his dead sister— Ellen Lester. For two weeks Peter watched by his bedside. Everyday came the Millerite Preacher, eager to watch and pray with the sick man. Charles at length began to recover from the delirium and fever. Very pale and weak, he besought William Marvin to watch by his bed, while Peter hurried forth to gain some intelligence of the Preacher. Peter searched the city through, tried every means within the reach of mortal man, yet still no word of the Preacher reached his ears. He had disappeared. He had not been seen since the night of the fire. Had the daughter of Alice Bayne, gone with him? Was she in his “charge?” The second day after the fire there was a funeral in Bonus Court. A rude hearse, containing a pine coffin, moved slowly through the city, followed by the Millerite Preacher and his daughter. It paused on a bleak common, near the Eastern Penitentiary, and in front of an unpainted fence, which separated a space of barren earth some two acres in extent, from the surrounding waste. The hearse passed through a gate, and entered the space surrounded by the rough fence, and halted again beside a new made grave. Then William Marvin and the driver lifted the pine coffin and lowered it into the grave. The driver shoveled the earth upon it, while the Millerite on his knees, with Hannah by his side, uttered a prayer. That was the manner of the funeral of Ann Clarke, who was buried in Potter's field. The second day after the fire, Stewel Pydgeon was lounging near the Railroad Depot, at the corner of Eleventh and Market streets. He was anxious to gain some intelligence of Goodleigh. Thinking that he had escaped the fire, and might make an attempt to leave the city, Stewel watched for him at the Railroad Depot. While his eyes were fixed upon the aperture where tickets are sold, an aged man with long white hair approached, and bought tickets for himself and two boys, who, attired in blue cloth round-a-bouts, walked by his side. These boys were somewhat contrasted, in the details of their personal appearance. One was slight and slender; the other bony and rugged. Both were attired in round-jackets and pantaloons of blue cloth, and both wore cloth caps, of the same color. The aged man, attired neatly in a blue overcoat, carried a bundle under his arm; a bundle, which, resembling a large book, was covered with a scarlet handkerchief. Stewel watched the three, as they left the ticket office and entered the cars. The place where he stood was dark, even in daytime, and he could not see their faces with much distinctness, but their attire seemed to please him exceedingly — “A blue party!” he exclaimed — and laughed at his own joke — after the manner of police officers — “They look as if they been dipped in indigo.” With this joke — or apology for a joke — the incident passed from Stewel's mind. He suffered the old man and his two boys to enter the cars, and go on their journey to Baltimore, without a word. And yet the old man was our friend, the Popular Preacher. And the tallest of the boys was Ralph Jones, otherwise called “Jonesey the B'iler.” The other boy was Fanny, the sister of Ralph. And the bundle, which looked like a large book, was the TIN BOX, which Ralph had concealed beneath the roof of Girard College. And yet Stewel, standing near the ticket office, watching for Goodleigh, looked upon these three figures, dressed in blue, without a suspicious thought. Alas! for Stewel! While he watched for Goodleigh, the TIN BOX slipped by him, and passed on to Baltimore without an opposing word.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIFTH. THE LAST OF ISRAEL BONUS. And while two days wore on, much wonder was felt and expressed in Bonus Court. Rent Day had come and gone, and Israel Bonus had not appeared to collect his rents! Had the sun risen in the west and set in the east, doubtless the inhabitants of Bonus Court would have expressed some surprise, in common with the other citizens of the Quaker City, but that Rent Day should come and go without Israel Bonus, this was a thing which made every heart in Bonus Court dilate with a feeling akin to awe Never for thirty years had Israel been known to miss a Rent Day. “Hannah,” said the Millerite Preacher, taking his broad rimmed hat, on the third morning after the fire: “This absence of Israel Bonus fills me with wonder. I will call at his house — something may have happened to him. The day draws near, Hannah, when the Lord will come in the clouds of Heaven, we must meet him with clean hands and pure hearts. I would not wrong Israel out of his rent, though he is hard upon the poor. And while I am gone my child, do you take some wood and some bread to poor Nancy over the way. Her husband is in jail, you know, on a charge of theft. The poor woman must not be forgotten.” “I will not forget her father,” was the response of Hannah, as she pressed her father's hand, while her face warmed with the same looks of calm enthusiasm, which animated the countenance of the Millerite Preacher. “You have heard nothing of Fanny — or Ralph?” “Not a word. Their disappearance is mysterious. And what is still more remarkable, Mr. Jervis, the popular preacher, has not been heard of since the night of the fire.” The Millerite left his home, and made the best of his way to the residence of israel Bonus. The sun was shining brightly upon the face of the mansion, as the Millerite paused at the foot of its marble steps. But there was an air of unusual desertion about the residence of Bonus, which the bright sunshine only made more apparent. It was an old house, three stories high, and presenting the appearance of age and wear, in every faded brick. It stood in a wide street, not far from the heart of the city, and yet removed from its noise and bustle, as effectually as though it had been built in the very heart of Bonus Court. It was one of those mansions, which are not so much remarkable for the prime neatness of their exterior — characteristic of the great mass of buildings in the Quaker City — as for a look of battered antiquity, which spreads like a great spider web, over the surface of dingy brick, from the garret to the cellar. Marvin when passing this way, had often noticed the windows on the lower floor, which were adorned by curtains of faded green reaching half way up the uncleanly window-panes. And who among the thousands of passers-by had not noticed the tin sign, which affixed to a shutter, bore in faded letters this significant inscription:— ISRAEL BONUS, CONVEYANCER. N. B. Real Estate bought and sold. But to the great surprise of Marvin, the shutters on the lower floor were closed, hiding green curtains, dirty windows, and the very name of Bonus, from the public gaze. The upper windows had no shutters, and therefore it may be reasonably imagined, that their dusty panes were opened to the light of the winter's 12 day. The house, faded at all times, and always reminding the spectator of an old parchment deed, now looked as though it had not been tenanted for years. Marvin ascended the marble steps covered with snow and ice, and rung the bell, whose nandle was coated with a rich layer of verdigris, and waited with some impatience for the sound of Bonus' footstep. Bonus, when destitute of a housekeeper, or a housekeeper's pretty daughter, was wont to answer the bell himself, and dart upon his visiter in all the magnitude of ruffled shirt, fair-top boots, and bone-headed cane. Marvin rang and waited in vain. A half an hour elapsed, and still no Bonus appeared. Casting his eye along the door, he for the first time beheld a small piece of paper, pasted upon the panel, and containing the following important information: “OUT OF TOWN: Back in a few days.” “Gone to see some of his relations who live in the country,” soliloquized Marvin, as he returned slowly homeward. “He has no relatives in this city, I believe. An old bachelor, without a soul on earth to care for him, or bear his name.” Two days passed, and yet Israel Bonus did not appear in Bonus Court. The wonder of the tenants increased beyond all power of expression. Five days had now elapsed since Bonus had been seen on Third street. The Men of Money began to wonder at his absence. His fair-top boots were sadly missed along the Coast of Barbary, and the Algerines began to ask of one another: “What has become of Bonus?” To top the climax, and develope simple wonder into the very intensity of astonishment, on the fifth day a note of Bonus' for five hundred dollars, due at the Shaver's Bank, was handed over to the Notary Public. Bonus protested! Third street began to shake in its shoes, and the Board of Brokers was affected to its inmost soul. On the morning of the fifth day, Marvin once more ascended the marble steps — after a due survey of the closed shutters — and once more pulled the bell, with a verdigris handle. The notice of Bonus' absence was still pasted to the door — and Marvin pulled and pulled for an half an hour, without awaking the most remote sign of life in the silent mansion. At length he tried the handle of the door. It yielded to his touch, and the door sprung open. “Strange indeed! Israel out of town and the door not locked!” ejaculated Marvin, as he surveyed the broad entry by the light of the morning sun: “The old man may be sick. At least it will do no harm to enter and test the matter for myself.” He entered the house of Israel Bonus, and passing along the entry — whose chill atmosphere pierced his very marrow — he soon stood at the foot of the stairs, which lighted by a circular window, wound upward into the second and third stories. He listened for a moment: all was breathlessly still. He began to ascend the stairs, and discovered with some surprise, that every step was littered with small pieces of parchment, looking like the fragments of old title deeds. He reached the entry of the second story, and beheld the sun shining through the door at its farther end. Along the entry and through the door he passed, and in a moment found himself in a large room, furnished with but four articles of use or adornment. A huge pine desk, painted red; an old stool with three legs; a chair with a broken back; and a map of “building lots” pinned to the smoky wall. This was the Confessional Box of Bonus, where Bonus lent money, and listened to the pleas of money borrowers, and wrote their names in his big book, with a red morocco back. “He is certainly out of town,” murmured Marvin — “But bless me, what does this mean?” Under the red desk, a mass of papers was rudely scattered, which to the eyes of Marvin looked like the wrecks of an hundred title deeds. The floor was littered with bits of parchment. The cover of the great book with a morocco back lay near the fireless grate, and on the bars of the grate itself, were piled the leaves of the great book, evidently in readiness for the application of a lighted match. In a word, the sanctuary of Bonus had been violated by unholy hands. The great book, in which was inscribed the damnation of a thousand souls, was now only a mass of fragments. The title deeds, and mortgages of Bonus, severed into innumerable little pieces, now only served to relieve the nakedness of the uncarpeted floor. “There have been robbers in this house!” ejaculated Marvin. Was it a fancy! The sound of a human voice, seemed echoing faintly, in the next room. A very low voice, murmuring in a monotonous tone, reached the ears of the Millerite Preacher. He left the sanctuary of Bonus, passed into the entry, and halted before the door of the back room. He now heard the voice again, but could not distinguish the words. Hush! Pressing his head against the door he listens — there are two voices! He hears them distinctly and can gather the meaning of their words. Those words leave Marvin no time for thought. Silently unclosing the door, he gazes through the aperture, and beholds a bed resting under the light of two windows, opening toward the yard of Bonus' house. And on that bed is stretched Isarel Bonus, in full dress — wide skirted coat, ruffled shirt and fair-top boots. His broad rim and bone headed cane, lay on a chair, near the bedside. Bonus in full uniform, Bonus in bed with his clothes on, but alas! no longer the gay, jocund Bonus of other days! For, holding the door slightly open — gazing through the aperture as he pauses on the threshold — William Marvin, beholds the face of Israel Bonus, as it is turned upwards towards the light. That face is hideous with the same pestilence which destroyed the life of Ann Clarke. Blotched from the double-chin to the eyes, buried in wrinkles — blotched in every line and feature — the face of Israel Bonus presents a loathsome spectacle. His very eyes are sealed by the pestilence. His hands, still encircled by rufiles, are covered with the marks of the appalling disease. And stretched upon the coverlet, in his every day attire, the wretched man turns his head from side to side, lifts his blinded eyeballs to the light, and moves his clotted lips — “Thee must pay the mortgage by twelve o'clock, this day, or verily I will foreclose.” These words escape from his lips, as he tosses about, in the delirium engendered by the pestilence. Marvin listened no longer, but opening wide the door entered the room. Entered, and stood thunderstricken by a new surprise. There, perched upon a chair at the foot of the bed, was the figure of a half-naked man, who resting his elbows on his knees, and his cheeks in his hands, gazed steadily upon the face of Israel Bonus. A pair of coarse trowsers and a check shirt, constituted the apparel of this man who watched by the bed of pestilence. His hair, tangled and disordered, fell over his forehead to the very brows, but could not veil the intense glare of his eyes. “Do you think I must pay the mortgage Isr'el?” exclaimed the half-naked man, in a jesting tone — “Couldn't you let me have a leetle time?” “Thee must pay or I will foreclose! Thee must pay or I will foreclose!” was the response of the delirious Bonus. Marvin advanced, and at once the truth burst upon him, as he took a nearer view of the features of the man at the foot of the bed. It was John Cattermill, watching by the death-bed of Israel Bonus. “John! John!” ejaculated Marvin: “What does this mean?” Without starting the man raised his face from his hands, and surveyed Marvin with a steady but half-vacant look. “Mornin' Sir. Sit down and take a cheer. We're rayther bad off for wood, and so I had to make a fire as well as I could out o' them old books and papers.” Marvin, glancing over his shoulder, beheld the grate packed to its topmost bar, with huge account books and parchment deeds. A slight flame, half choked in a cloud of smoke, ascended from the mass. “John! John! What have you been doing?” John very quietly replied: “You know I was put in M'yamensin' last Sunday night?” “Yes — very sorry I was to hear of it.” “Well, on Tuesday mornin' I was brought up for a hearin' afore Alderman Rumjug. But I giv' the officer the slip, and came here to have a talk with old Bonus. I got in the back way, over the fence, and by that winder.” “What was your intention, John? Surely you did not mean —” “Fact is Mr. Marvin, I meant to settle an old account with the man. I was sure of goin' to jail for an offence which I never committed, so I thought I'd giv' 'em a reason for lockin' me up. You may have heer'd that I was rayther a quiet, sober sort of man, afore I met old Bonus?” “Yes, John. You never drank until you encountered him —” “And arter I met him, I became a drunkard — a loafer — and was in a fair way to become a thief. So, I thought all this over, and last Tuesday mornin' I crawled into that winder, afore Bonus was up, and to be candid with you, did think of givin' him a rap or two with some stick or poker, over his head. But —” “Yes, John. But you relented —” “I found him in bed, sick with a fever. I took pity on him.” The face of John, haggard and pale, with an inexplicable light in the large vacant eyes, was agitated by a slight grimace as he uttered these words. “I took pity on him. Found a notice on his table — `Out of Town: won't be back 'till next week” — and put it on the front door. Didn't want anybody to disturb him, you know? That was on Tuesday — this is Saturday. Ain't I a good Christian? Ever since Tuesday I've watched by the old man's bed.” “But John, why have you destroyed these books and papers —” “There wasn't no wood. Do you think I was a-goin' to let the old critter suffer for fire?” “You attended to his wants, then? How did you procure food?” “There was a cold b'iled ham in the cellar. That I've lived upon myself. As for Bonus” — he looked into Marvin's face with a broad grin — “Don't you think a severe course o' dietin' is good for a disease like that?” He pointed with his lean and skinny hand toward the bed. “John, John, how could you behold the old man suffer, without extending a hand for his relief?” “Did you think I was a-goin' to give him bread, when it 'ud only heighten his fever? As for water — Lord bless you! He cried for it often enough, but knew more o' th' natur' o' his disease than to give it to him. Not a drop! Not a drop!” “This is too horrible for belief!” ejaculated Marvin, gazing first upon the half naked man, and then upon the wretched occupant of the bed. “Horrible? How green you talk! Don't you know that unless all of old Bonus's had blood comes out in the shape of eruptions, that the dear old man 'ill kick the bucket? Jist look at him! You think them's small pox on his face? Bless your soul — no! It's only the mortgages and ground rents a-comin' out. That's all.” And at these words, he placed his elbows on his knees, his cheeks between his hands, and turned his eyes to the bed once more. “Isr'el, I raly can't pay up to-day —” he exclaimed, assuming the tone of a pleading debtor — “You won't turn me out into the street — will you?” “If thee cannot pay thee must go!” said the delirious Bonus — “Hair and hide, bag and baggage, thee must go! What? Does thee think I am to be defrauded of my rent in this manner? Tut-tut!” “Rulin' passion strong in death,” cried John, turning his face to Marvin, with a grotesque leer — “Don't you think when he goes down there, he'll be apt to get a mortgage on the Devil hisself, and turn the imps out o' perdition, for not payin' ground rent? Hey?” “John, how can you desert your wife?” exclaimed Marvin, wishing to touch the heart of this monomaniac — “Poor Nancy! She is destitute of bread and wood —” “One's duty to the public al'ays take the precedence of private affairs,” answered John; “I've watched by Bonus since last Tuesday, and I'll sit here till he gets well. You little know how I love that ar' old crittur!” Marvin approached the bed. His face was clouded by an expression of unfeigned horror, when he saw that Israel Bonus, dying as much of starvation as of disease — was near his last hour. Tossing on the pillow, rolling his blinded eyeballs from side to side, the dying man still murmured in his delirium — “Can thee pay? If thee can't pay, thee must go! So, thee has a pretty daughter? Eh? Then thee shall come and keep house for me, and I'll take care of thee daughter's education. Not less than two per cent a month. Could'nt think of it. How did thee say Pennsylvania Fives were yesterday? Can thee pay? Don't talk to me. If thee can't pay thee must go.” “Jist hear him,” whispered John — “ain't it a treat? What's that the poet says about the good man's death?” The eyes of Cattermill began to assume an expression, which impressed the mind of Marvin with a sensation of terror, which he in vain endeavoured to repress. “He is mad,” the thought crept over him — “and if I attempt to leave the room, he will prevent me with a madman's strength.” “Well, John, I must go home,” he said aloud, moving to the door — “call and see us when Bonus recovers.” To his utter surprise, John calmly replied — “Good mornin', sir. The next time you walk this way, drop in and see us.” Marvin left the room and hurried from the house, and in five minutes again returned with a crowd of neighbours, whom he had summoned to his assistance. Once more he opened the door, and followed by the wondering crowd, entered the death-room. Israel Bonus was there, not stretched upon the bed, but seated in an arm chair, near a window, with his broad rim on his head, and his cane in his hand. Israel Bonus was alone; seated in the arm chair which had so long been the throne of Mortgage, Ground Rent, and Title Deed; with half his face in shadow, and the lower portion blotched by pestilence, bathed in the cheerful light of the morning sun. It did not need a second glance to tell the spectators that Israel Bonus was no longer numbered among the living. John Cattermill had disappeared — no one could tell how — and the spectators, gathering silently around the dead man, with wonder and awe upon every face, stood for many minutes, rooted to the floor, their eyes centred upon the dead face of Israel Bonus. John Cattermill was never seen again in the Quaker City.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIXTH. “THE END OF THE WORLD DRAWS NIGH.” Charles Lester, recovering from his fever, began to walk abroad again. The spring was upon the earth once more, and despite the gloom which overshadowed him, he began to feel the blood bounding freely in his veins again. Peter pursued his search after the Preacher; and of course his search was vain. Charles was much in company with the Millerite Preacher. His mind, depressed by an ever present sorrow, was prepared for the reception of the Millerite's doctrine. They talked long and earnestly together —together they read the Bible, and attempted to follow the finger of God, in the book of Daniel and the book of Revelations. “Is Charley a-goin' to jine these Millerites?” Peter soliloquized one day; “Should like to know. Wish I could get him out of this town, into the prairies once more. Bad, very bad, the atmosphere of the Quaker City.” A month passed in this manner. Still no intelligence reached the ears of Charles Lester concerning the Preacher or the daughter of Alice Bayne. Wandering through the city, day after day, in company with Marvin the Millerite, Charles sought incessantly for the Preacher and for Fanny, and his search was fruitless. And the Millerite many times concluded his long and earnest conversations, with these singular words: “Never mind, Charles. These matters will soon cease to trouble you. The twenty-third of April draws nigh.” Charles' eyes, vacant at other times with the abstraction of a settled melancholy, would light up at these words, and impart a look of sudden rapture to his haggard face. For at the moment when the birds were singing, and the leaves were budding — when the world recovering from the death of winter was springing into life again — Charles had given up all the prospects and hopes of existence. He was the last of his race. The graves of all his people were in the churchyard of the western land. Fanny, the daughter of Alice, whom he had hoped to save, was now lost to him, and lost to purity forever. The last victim of the Popular Preacher, she was following the path which led to an untimely death and an unblest grave. “The twenty-third of April!” these words often passed the lips of Charles after a long-continued reverie. On the Twenty-third of April the world was to come to an End. The Saviour would appear in the clouds of heaven; the earth and all the elements would melt with fervent heat. The awful images of the Revelations would start into actual life. From the chaos of an expiring universe, a new heaven and a new earth would struggle into being. How many thousand, and tens of thousands in the year 1843, throughout the extent of the Union, held this belief, and daily watched for the coming of the Lord? How many hearts throbbed with unutterable awe, at the mention of the day, when all these things should come to pass — the twenty-third of April, 1843? The Twenty Third of April came at last. In the morning, Peter who had wandered into the — Hotel in Chesnut Street, (where seated in the reading room he awaited the appearance of Charles,) was much interested in the following paragraph which met his eye in the columns of the Daily Copper: “The Rev. Edmund Jervis.—This cloquent gentleman was in Adamston, State of Illinois, in the latter part of March. We are pleased to learn that an extensive and interesting revival of religion, was in progress in Adamstown during the presence of this pious and eminent Minister. Thousands were affected to tears by his preaching, and hundreds, impelled to a better life by his irresistible appeals, have become members of his Church. Indeed wherever this gentleman goes, the blessings of Providence attends his efforts, in a manner too remarkable not to be mentioned.” This paragraph, its grammar, piety and praise, was evidently from the pen of Slinkum Scissleby, Sub-Editor of the Daily Copper. “Adamston is not five miles from Prairie Home,” ejaculated Peter, “Charley must know this afore I'm a-second older. The vil lian! Holdin' one of his revivals not five miles from Ellen's grave!” Peter hurried without delay to the room of Charles, but Charles was not to be found. “He is in Bonus Court with that Millerite!” exclaimed Peter, and without delay he hurried to Bonus Court. The place, drear and gloomy at all times, now looked the very abode of desolation. The house where Ann Clarke had died, was tenantless. The doors and windows were open, and the dust had accumulated on the floors. At least one-half of the houses of Bonus Court were in a similar condition. Peter hurried to the residence of the Rev. William Marvin. Doors and shutters closed, it presented a blank and deserted appearance. “This is queer,” soliloquized Peter — “Everybody out o' town and Charley not to be found.” As he spoke, his attention was attracted by a paper pasted upon the shutter, and bearing the following inscription, traced in a round and legible hand: The owner of this house has gone to wait the coming of the Lord. Wm. Marvin. April 23, 1843. “Well he might a-told me whar he's gone to, and whar he expects to find the Lord!” Thus soliloquizing, Peter once more departed on his search. All day long he sought for Charles — sought in every haunt of business or pleasure — in the Hotels, the Stores, and along the crowded streets — and toward night, was forced to give up the search in very despair. As night fell, he went to the Post Office, as was his custom and enquired for a letter for “Charles Lester.” To his surprise, the clerk placed a letter in his hand, directed to “Charles Lester, Philadelphia,” and bearing the following post-mark “Prairie-Home, Ill., April 5.” This letter completed the wonder and deepened the anxiety of our good friend Peter. “Prairie Home! Did'nt know that anybody thar know'd anything about Charley's comin' to 'Fildelfy. What's this letter about? That Preacher and the gal! I'll stake my head upon it.” Much perplexed, Peter returned to the — Hotel, and took his seat in the reading room, inspecting the face of every new-comer, in his anxiety to behold the countenance of Charles Lester once more. Attired still in the scarlet coat, he placed his huge boots upon a neighboring chair, drew a cigar from his pocket, and soon encircled himself in a cloud of tobacco smoke. His eyes fixed upon the letter he resigned himself to his meditations, and murmured every now and then, between the puffs of smoke, some broken sentence like this — “Know'd her when she was a baby. Know'd her when she was a gal. Know'd her when she was a corpse.” The honest backwoodsman, thus quietly meditating, little knew the contents of the letter, which he held in his brawny hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVENTH. “THE CAMP OF THE LORD.” Leave Philadelphia, reader, and cross the Schuylkill by the Market Street Bridge. Follow the road that leads into the open country, and do not pause, until you stand beside a black and barren field which slopes from the turnpike to a distant wood. The sky is obscured by driving clouds. A misty rain is falling, and the wind howls in gusts. Gaze over the bleak expanse of this field, and tell me, what is it that intervenes between your gaze, and the dull leaden sky? A white tent, rising distinctly from the brown field, and with gleams of light escaping from its parted curtains. From that tent, a low murmuring sound escapes. Approach its curtains; do not heed the leaden sky and driving blast; cross the field, and stand within the gleam of those wandering rays. Listen! That sound, lately so low and murmuring, now becomes distinct and intelligible. It is the voice of praise and prayer. The voices of men, women, and children, melting together, in one incessant hymn and supplication. This white tent, echoing with praise and prayer, the storm beating on its roof, and the bleak waste and the dark night, all around it, strikes you with an impression of curiosity modified by awe. You pause on the drenched sod; you place your hand upon the curtain; while the gust howls over the field, you part the curtains and look within: Dim lights are burning there. Rude tallow candles, inserted into rough boards, shed their uncertain light over a thousand faces. The faces of aged men — of fair and delicate women — of children, who had scarcely passed the dawn of life — all uplifted, and all imbued with the same look of rapture and fear. They are singing now — listen to their hymn! Its burden steals into your soul, you know not why. 'Tis but an unpretending hymn, deficient in rhyme and rugged in its words, and yet the voices of these kneeling worshippers, mingling in one sound, as if their hearts were inspired by one soul, impart to it a music and a passion that may well be deemed supernatural. “The Lord is coming” — this is the burden of the hymn — “ere the midnight hour has struck, Jesus will come in the clouds of Heaven, and call his wandering children home. The unbelievers will expire in the agonies of an expiring world. The children of the Lord, those who have loved his name and watched for him long, will pass into Eternity without the change of death. Gathered from a burning world, by the Divine Redeemer, they will arise at once — without a sigh or pang to the Mansions of their God.” In a word, reader, we are in the Camp of the Millerites. These men and women, these rich and poor, these people gathered from all classes of the social world, have pitched their tent in the barren field, away from the sin and life of the Great City, and here they have determined to await the coming of the Lord. Do not call them fanatics. Grave Divines, for hundreds of years, have been writing great books, concerning the Prophecies of Daniel and the Book of Revelations. These people of the tent, these despised Milllerites have merely carried the speculations of the learned Divines into practice. They have summed up the opinions of the sagacious theologians, concerning the Millenium, and the amount of their researches, is comprised in this line — “On the Twenty-third of April, 1843, the world will come to an end, and the Millenium begin.” Do not treat with idle scorn this fanaticism of the Millerites. It is true, that the only Millenium preached by the Bible of Revelation, and the Bible of Nature, is embraced in a single brief sentence: “When every man in the world looks to the welfare of his brother, then the Lord Christ will appear on the earth, not in bodily shape, but in the happiness of the whole family of man.” The truth contained in this sentence, has been too simple for your Theologians. They prefer to amuse themselves with speculations on the moods and tenses of dead languages, or the Prophecies of Daniel, or the Mysteries of Revelations — and blunder deeper into learned darkness, until they have left the plain facts of the Gospel of Nazareth, altogether out of sight. Do you blame the poor that they have at last believed the theologians, and turned their theological riddle into an every-day fact? A solitary man stands up in the centre of the kneeling throng. It is William Marvin, whose plain features are now imbued with a calm — almost — god-like rapture. Clasping his knees, a little child with hazel eyes and nut-brown hair looks lovingly into his face. And behind Marvin, in the shadows of the rude pillar which supports the roof of the tent, behold a young man who stands alone, with folded arms and head bent upon his breast. His eyes are well-nigh buried under his compressed brows: there are the traces of a violent mental struggle — a struggle of doubt and hope — visible in every line of his countenance. It is Charles Lester, listening in silence to the words of the Millerite Preacher. “Brothers! Sisters! The time approaches. The end of all things is at hand.” The voice of Marvin scarcely rising above a whisper, is heard distinctly in every part of the tent; heard in every heart, and answered by sobs of prayer. “The hour of twelve is near. When the clock strikes twelve, the Lord will come.” These words doubtless seem altogether plain and unmeaning. But there was the power of a singular magnetism in the Preacher's eye, and every heart within the shelter of that tabernacle, beat with that divine magnetism which men call FAITH. Charles Lester drew forth his watch: it was within five minutes of the hour of twelve. Impressed by the long conversation of the Millerite, and yet unable to believe in his doctrine, Charles had come to this tent as a mere spectator. He had watched there all day long. And now against his will he felt the magnetic tide which flowed from heart to heart — pervading the crowd as with the pulsation of a supernatural power — glide into his own soul, and storm the last entrenchment of his unbelief. His eyes caught the fire which shone from a thousand eyes. He clasped his hands, and raised his voice in prayer. Beside the form of the Millerite, rose the figure of a woman clad in white, who lifted her hands above the crowd, and spoke to their hearts a rhapsody such as might have fallen from a Prophetess of the far gone olden time. A young woman, whose plain features, shaded by light brown hair, warmed suddenly into a hallowed beauty — whose eyes of dark grey, suddenly shone with the clear deep lustre of enthusiasm or prophecy — whose voice, at first faint and tremulous, rose gradually into accents of melody, which swept into every heart like music from a Better World. It was Hannah Marvin, the Millerite's Daughter. Alone she stood, lifted above the crowd, her whole dress standing out palpably from the background of deep shadow. It was now within three minutes of the hour of twelve. “He comes! The Lord who walked the sands of Palestine, and watered the earth with tears. He comes! The Lord who made his resting place with the Poor, and went day after day, among their homes, raising their sick, feeding their suffering and telling every one — even the basest child of want — `in my Father's house are many mansions —' ” At this moment, Charles who stood near the pillar, entranced as much by the tone as by the words of the Woman, felt an unknown hand pressed within his own. He turned and beheld the rugged visage of our friend Peter “Read!” he whispered foreing a letter into the hand of Lester. Charles broke the seal, and by the dim light read the letter, and without pausing for a moment after he had devoured its contents, he descended from the platform and hurried through the kneeling crowd, with Peter following at his heels. “Whither go you!” cried Marvin, his eye vacant and absent, with the light of enthusiam. Charles did not pause to answer, but hurried on. “He goes to mingle once more with the cares and sins of earth,” the voice of the Millerite Prophetess reached the ears of the fugitive — “Woe! woe! to the disciple who turns his back upon the Lord!” And the words were echoed by a thousand voices, but Charles hurried on. The contents of the letter, eagerly traced by the dim light, had once more aroused the fires of Revenge within his breast. His teeth set together, his face corrugated with the dark lines of hatred, he rushed from the tent into the dark night, exclaiming as he pointed to the distant city: “There lies our way! We will track this fiend in human shape to the end of the earth! Before morning light, we must be on our way to the wes: — aye — on our way to Prairie Home.” And they went forth together, the hardy back woodsman and the Brother of Ellen. Meanwhile within the tent of the Millerites, a thousand hearts were beating in expectation of the Coming Lord. While the Prophetess spoke, her every word answered by bursts of praise and prayer, the last three minutes passed away. The hour of twelve came at last. And a thousand hearts were hushed in awe while the voice of the Woman were in the accents of triumph that was almost divine — “Arise! Arise! I hear the footsteps of the Lord — I feel the rustling of the angels' wings — I feel the presence of our God! Arise! Arise! And greet the first day of the new-born world!” And for three days and nights they waited there in rain and storm, in hunger and cold, looking to Heaven with a faith that grew stronger with every hour. And returning at last, sad and dispirited to their deserted homes — mocked at every step by scoffs and jeers — derided by the very Theologians whose speculations they had so blindly followed — these believers in the Millenium, sat once more amid the cares and and pains of life. Many of them who had looked for the Lord in the clouds of Heaven, found him in the quiet of their Homes and in the peace of their Hearts. Shall we read the letter, which postmarked “Prairie Home,” aroused once more the love of life and the passion of vengeance within the breast of Charles Lester? A single paragraph may throw some light upon the progress of this history: Prairie Home, Ill., April 4, 1843. Jervis has been preaching in this county. He is accompanied by a man who calls himself Dr. Arthur Baldwin, and who has two young persons with him, whom he calls his children. Do you know anything of this “Popular Preacher?” May he not be the same person who, under an assumed name * * * * * * * * * * * * And thus it appeared that Fanny and Ralph had discovered their Father at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHTH. CHOKTIPAW. Do you see yonder mansion which stands upon the hill, above the town of Choktipaw? The night is dark; the sky is obscured by one dense mass of leaden clouds, fringed with lightning gleams upon the horizon, and the town of Choktipaw sleeps quiet and snug between the hillside and the broad river. But this mansion, tall and stately, and built half-way up the hill, is illuminated from garret to cellar. The lofty trees which rise on either hand, with trunks like sculptured columns, and foliage thick and branching like the canopy of a tent, are reddened on every leaf by the gleams of light which stream from the mansion windows. That house to-night may be seen from a great distance. Illuminated for a festival, and crowded with guests from far and near, it shines through the darkness, and looks glad 13 and joyous in the midst of the black and desolate night. And where is this town of Choktipaw? In Arkansas, good friend, near a commanding hill and upon the shore of a broad river. More we dare not tell. For a week the town of Choktipaw has been the scene of great excitement. The Celebrated Preacher — the Popular Preacher — the eloquent and pious Edmund Jervis, appeared last week in Choktipaw, and has preached in the — Church of Choktipaw, and fired all Choktipaw with the enthusiasm of his own saintly soul. For a week a revival has been in progress; one of the Popular Preacher's revivals, which spread like fire in a drought, and bring mourners by hundreds to the altar. Everybody is occupied with Jervis. His looks, his tones, the whiteness of his cravat, the elegant fit of his black frock coat, the pathos of his uplifted eyes, the alabaster delicacy of his hands, the sweetness of his manner — such have been the topics of Choktipaw for a week, and Choktipaw still talks them over and over again. And to-night the Great Preacher is to be married. To whom? Do not be impatient. Look through the windows of this elegant mansion on the hillside, and survey the brilliant assemblage of wedding guests. Beautiful girls, grave matrons, sober farmers, and dashing gentlemen of much leisure and many slaves, are gathered there in a spacious parlor, by the light of waxen candles, awaiting impatiently the appearance of three persons — the Minister, the Bridegroom, and the Bride. For the whole country, at least the religion and gentility of the country for twenty miles, have been gathered to-night to the mansion of Col. Thorberry, where the Popular Preacher is to wed his young and beautiful Bride. While the guests are waiting on the ground-floor, while the rich steams of the marriage supper steal out into the open air, and charm the nostrils of the negroes, who are grouped near the brilliantly illuminated windows — let us ascend into a chamber on the second floor, and listen to an important conversation. A grave sedate man, with a round face, short and portly figure, black dress and white cravat, is seated in an arm chair, beside a table, on which a lamp is burning. He rests his elbow on the table, and supports his round cheek in the hollow of his hand, and gazes with a calm sweet look, into the face of a young girl, who attired in spotless white, kneels at his feet, and places her clasped hands upon his knees. Her dark hair is covered by a veil of transparent lace, which relieves the colorless pallour of her face, and imparts a new loveliness to her calm white forehead, and delicately pencilled brows. Beautiful in her white bridal dress, she looks upward, into her Father's face, her large eyes swimming in tears. For it is Fanny and her Father that we behold. In other words, Dr. Arthur Baldwin and his long lost Daughter. But Dr. Baldwin has been dead for a year past — Has he? Tell that story to the gossips of Choktipaw and they will laugh in your face. Do they not know the whole story? How the eloquent Preacher discovered the long lost daughter of the wealthy Dr. Baldwin, in the suburbs of Philadelphia, and how the beautiful girl fell in love with the Preacher, and obtained her father's consent for the marriage? Not a child in all Choktipaw but has the story by heart. And now, while the marriage supper is preparing and while the marriage guests are waiting, here in this quiet chamber, the Father and the Daughter have met for an interesting conversation. “Did not Edmund discover you in Philadelphia?” “Yes, Father” — “Did he not rescue you and Harry from the dangers of a city life? Answer me, Annie?” Annie and Harry you must bear in mind, have taken the place of Fanny and Ralph? “Yes, father —” “Did not Edmund send me word that he had found you — found my long lost children —” the Dr. passed a finger over each eye; “And did he not bring you to meet me, without delay?” “I remember it well, father. We met near Prairie Home in Illinois. And then we resumed our journey, and came to this town a week ago. I remember it all, and thank Edmund for his kindness, and speak of him every hour, in my prayers, but —” “But Annie!” answered Dr. Baldwin, gently raising his right hand, while an expression of deep sorrow came over his face — “But you don't wish to marry him. Can it be, my child! Edmund who has restored you to my arms — Edmund who has been the means of your conversion — Edmund who walks the earth, like a Disciple of the Apostolic era — Edmund, gifted, pious, eloquent and popular! And you do not wish to marry a man like this! My child, my child!” Covering his face with his hands, he seemed much affected by the conduct of his beloved child. Poor Fanny — for we must call her by her old name — beheld his unfeigned emotion, and burst into tears. “Father! Father! Do not I beseech you, think me ungrateful or unkind! You have only to speak and I will obey —” He raised his eyes, and smiled and patted her cheek with his hand. “That's a good child. You will obey your poor, weak, affectionate father, who loves you, all too fondly? You will chase these tears away, and forget these words of disobedience, and give your hand, willingly to our dear, dear Edmund?” “But Father —” “That's enough, my dear. Go, child. Your bridesmaids are waiting for you in the next room. Go — compose your thoughts — whisper a prayer or two that the old Adam may be conquered in your heart — and prepare to meet your dear Edmund, with a loving heart, and countenance adorned with peace.” He raised Fanny from her knees. Hushing her words by a gentle pressure of his hand upon her lips, he urged her to the door, and kissed her on the forehead, whispering — “Bless you my child! Don't break its poor old father's heart — that's a blessed child.” And thus Fanny left her father, and went to join her bridal maidens. Dr. Baldwin was alone. Walking along the carpet, from the window to the light, and back again, he seemed absorbed in a pleasing reverie. He drew forth his watch, after a silence of some fifteen minutes and exclaimed — “Half-past eight! Eh? The time moves slowly. At nine they are married.” When he raised his gaze from the watch, the Popular Preacher stood before him. You may have often heard the bold figure, “he looks as if he had just stepped from a band box” — but bold and imaginative as it seems, it was realized by the Popular Preacher on this occasion. His dress coat was of the sleekest and glossiest black cloth. His cravat was of cambric, elaborately starched; his pantaloons, fitting closely to his limbs, were as black and as glossy as his faultless coat. Boots of polished leather, very neat and tight, pinched his feet into the smallest possible compass. And then his face — blooming on the cheek, white upon the forehead, smiling on the lips and flashing in the eyes — his face seemed to have suddenly cast aside the burden of twenty years, as a ripe silk-worm casts aside its caterpillar skin, and in an instant, starts into a rainbow butterfly. From the cocoon of forty-five years growth — to grasp a bold figure — the silk-worm of a new youth, had emerged into life. The top-knot on his forehead, was softened down, into a mild and wavy curl. There was an odor of cologne and patchoulli about the man, from head to foot. The delicate hand — we mean his left hand — sparkled with a diamond ring upon the marriage finger. No sooner did the Dr. behold him, than he laid his finger significantly upon his lips: “Well, Doctor? How is it now?” whispers the Preacher. “All right. She yields to her fond old father.” “You will marry us Dr.? You are an Elder of our church you know, and have a right to celebrate the rites of marriage? Besides it will be a fine spectacle — the father not only giving away his beloved child, but performing the marriage ceremony for her. It will have a good effect.” “Well, Edmund if you insist. I suppose I must comply. By the bye Jervis we leave in the morning” — “On our way to New Orleans. There — you understand — we will sail for Europe” — “That is, you and I?” “Yes — of course. Leaving these children in New Orleans, while we make the European tour in company.” “Yes. The funds are all right — eh? What have you done with Ralph? Harry I should have said, but one forgets the name of a child, whom one has lost for nineteen years.” “He is all right, Dr. He has long since entrusted the tin box to my charge. And then I have had many opportunities to win his confidence, during our journey to the west. You know the boy is uncouth — but grateful —” “Where is he now?” “I was afraid his rude demeanor might give our friends an unfavorable opinion of him, so when he told me an hour ago that he wished to join a hunting party to-night, I cheerfully acquiesced. And he will not be back until morning.” “Go my dear Edmund. It is near the time. Compose your mind for this affecting ceremony. Go — I will join you down stairs in a few moments.” And with these words the Father parted from the Bridegroom. Their conversation which we have just recorded, may not seem important to the reader. But had you witnessed the smiles, the winks and gestures, which accompanied its every word, you would have been in no doubt concerning the prospects and intentions of this worthy pair. The Marriage Ceremony! Pale and beautiful in her white robes, Fanny stood in the centre of the crowd of wedding guests, and took the Preacher by the hand, while her father pronounced the marriage vows. And many a beautiful damsel there, envied the lot of the daughter of Alice Bayne, and many a wealthy father, desired with all his soul, a Bridegroom like the Preacher for every one of his children. When the marriage words were spoken, Jervis pressed the marriage kiss on the lips of his young wife. Fanny blushed and trembled, and seemed to shrink from his touch, but that was only maidenly modesty. Close upon the heels of the marriage ceremony, followed the marriage supper. Why chronicle minutely the events of that bountiful feast? How Fanny in all her blushes, sat at the head of the table, beside the portly owner of the mansion, Col. Thorberry; with her Husband on one hand, and her Father not far away? How the feast began with a voluminous grace and continued for two busy hours, until midnight drew near? The negroes are dancing on the lawn without, and the sound of banjo and fiddle, rings merrily on the air. A happy marriage, a beautiful bride, a pious, learned, eloquent and handsome bridegroom!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHTH. [sic] THE BRIDAL BED. Soon after midnight, the Bridesmaids led the Young Wife to the Bridal Chamber. And after a prayer, which long and full of unction, seemed to consecrate the harmless mirth of the marriage festival, the Bridegroom slipped quietly away, and went up the stairway toward the Bridal Chamber. At the threshold he paused, even as his hand was laid upon the door. He listened — all was gaiety and uproar below, but where he stood a silence like death prevailed. Gently opening the door, he entered the Bridal Chamber. It was the largest chamber in Col. Thorberry's elegant mansion. Rich curtains along the windows, which opened upon the balcony, rich carpet upon the floor, and pictures in glittering frames upon the walls. Upon a small table, near the centre of the carpet, stood a lamp, which shed a faint, and yet voluptuous light around the place. And in the rays of the light, appeared the snowy canopy of the Marriage Couch, with curtains as white and stainless, falling to the carpet, in long and sweeping folds. As he beheld the bed, the Bridegroom paused and pressed his finger to his lips, while his small eyes, enlarging in their sockets, shone with a fiery lustre. There, sheltered within the white curtains — like a budding flower, within its leaves — his Bride awaited him. “Fanny!” he whispered, in an impassioned tone, calling her by the name which she had borne from childhood. She did not answer. Was she sleeping? The Preacher stole on tip-toe to the bed, and laid his hand upon the curtains. They were closed, and the Bride was concealed within their tightly gathered folds. “Fanny!” he breathed her name once more and listened. His face kindled with a warmth that gave a singular look of youth and passion to every feature. His eyes emitted a stream of magnetic light. Still no answer was heard from within the curtains of the marriage bed. “She has sunk to slumber,” whispered the Preacher-Bridegroom — “I will gaze upon her as she sleeps. I will wake her with a kiss.” He drew the curtains and looked within. He did not behold his young wife's face, for in her slumber she had drawn the coverlet over her head, but the outlines of her form were dimly perceptible by the faint light. “Poor child! Scared by an unpleasant dream, she has buried herself in the coverlet. Let me wake her gently. Yes, let me wake her with a kiss.” He slowly raised the coverlet. And the next instant his face became livid, he stood paralyzed by the bed, unable to speak or stir, his lips apart and his eyes projecting from their sockets. What was the sight which caused this sudden and fearful change? Fanny in her sleep, with her dark hair, waving in glossy blackness, over her stainless bosom? No. Fanny dead — her eyes fixed — her bosom pulseless — her stiffened hands, folded over her lifeless yet beautiful form? No. Let us explain the mystery in a few words. When the Preacher slowly lifted the coverlet, a voice very deep and hoarse, and altogether unlike the mild accents of Fanny, greeted him, with these remarkable words: “How air you?” And the Preacher, in the place of the young and blooming form of his Bride, beheld a red face, adorned with white whiskers, and surrounded by a fur cap. And beneath this red face, appeared a huge form, clad in a scarlet over-coat, corduroy trowsers, and boots with soles half an inch thick. It needed no second glance to inform the Bridegroom, that where his Bride should have been, his old acquaintance, even the giant Peter was snugly reposing. It was indeed our old friend, Peter. There was an affectionate smile upon his lips, and a jovial twinkle in his eyes. “How air you?” he repeated, turning his face toward the Preacher: “How air you, honey?” and lovingly he spread forth his brawny arms. You cannot fail to perceive, that the Preacher had good reason for his surprise. Braver men than Jervis, would have been astonished by an occurrence like this. “Why don't you speak to me?” cried Peter, extending his brawny hand, and clenching the paralyzed wretch by the collar — “Don't you love me?” Peter displayed his teeth from ear to ear — “Come to bed honey. It's late and we'll have to be stirrin' airly in the mornin'.” He dragged the Preacher upon the bed, and impressed upon him, the sad necessity of silence with these words: “Jist speak above your breath dear, and —” and the cold muzzle of a pistol touched the Preacher's forehead. And then Peter, drawing from the fathomless depths of his pockets, a piece of cord, and certain silken handkerchiefs of various colours, proceeded to bind the limbs of the bridegroom, even as he lay upon his marriage bed. “Where is my wife?” gasped Jervis. “Ellen? She was in her grave when I last heer'd from her. You may have a chance to meet her soon.” “You don't mean to kill me?” the poor wretch shuddered, as he lay upon the bridal bed. “Not so loud. Low, very low you must speak, if you don't want to raise my temper. Hark now! The folks down stairs are about retirin' to their beds. The niggers have gone away from the front of the house. Now if you'll do me the kindness, jist obey a few directions, and it 'ill be mighty good for your wholesome. You hear —” “I am listening —” murmured Jervis. “I'm jist a goin' to carry you out o' the winder and along the balcony. Thar at the end of the balcony, a ladder is ready, and near the ladded a half dozen good fellows, on stout horses. You'll jist have the kindness, to let yourself be carried off quietly. That's all. If you make the least noise, I'll be obliged to —” once more the muzzle of the pistol touched the forehead of the Preacher. “I consent,” faltered the Preacher, “only spare my life.” Peter bound a black kerchief over his eyes. Then creeping from the bed, he raised the blindfolded man in his arms and bore him through the opened window, out upon the balcony. The Preacher felt a strange sinking of the heart, as he passed the confines of his Bridal Chamber. Peter passing along the balcony, descended a ladder which stood at one extremity, and by this ladder reached the ground. He found himself in the centre of a crowd of horsemen, whose faces were not distinguishable in the darkness. “All right?” said a voice — the Preacher knew it, and muttered to himself the solitary word: “Lester!” “Yes — right and snug,” exclaimed Peter, answering the voice. “Mount then, and let's be moving,” the voice was heard again. “Aye, aye,” said Peter, as holding the Preacher in his arms, he sprang into the saddle. “Forward!” cried the voice again, and twenty horses thundered over the lawn, toward the public road. The Preacher, clasped in the firm embrace of Peter, could not realize the scene. He believed himself entangled in the wonders of a nightmare. For an hour the horsemen pursued their way in silence. Every time that the Preacher attempted to speak, his mouth was closed by Peter's brawny hand. “You see, my dear,” Peter whispered, growing communicative as they dashed along: “You ought to feel grateful to Charles and me. We came all the way from Fildelfy arter you. We arriv' jist afore dark to-night at Choktipaw, and met Ralph in the woods a little west of the town. He spoke of a huntin' party did he not?” The Preacher uttered a deep groan. “That child looks green, but he ain't. Bless your soul, not a bit of it. Do you know that he had overheer'd some conversation between you and that Dr. Baldwin whom you raised from the dead, and consequently he begin to have some suspicions about you. But he did not know what to do, or whom to talk to. He was resolved, howsomdever, to watch you and the Doctor purty close, and to keep an especial eye to that tin box. You take? So jist afore dusk he meets us in the woods a little west of Choktipaw, and we soon come to an understandin'. You don't know who “we” means? Listen, my gospel brother, and I'll give you a hint. Suppose a dozen stout boys from Illinois get on your track, and suppose a dozen boys from Choktipaw j'ine 'em. What then? The Choktipaw folks (in the secret) go to your weddin' while the suckers from Illinois lay their plans around the house, and make their reckonin' to steal your wife away fust — and then her father — and then you!” Again the Preacher groaned. “You see Charley wanted to take Fanny away from the house without raisin' a fuss. So he waited until the weddin' was over, and the bride safe in bed, when — d'ye hear, my friend? When Ralph gits into her room through the balcony, and has a talk, and a very important talk it was, with his sister. Arter that talk, it was all up with you, my dear. When poor Fan was told by her brother, that her father wasn't her father, an' that the minister who married her wasn't a minister at all — Lord! The poor girl fairly jumped for joy!” The Preacher uttered a sound between his teeth, which very much resembled an oath. “One reason why Lester didn't seize you at the weddin' party, was this, my friend. The Choktipaw folks, whom he acquainted with your villany, just wished to see for their own satisfaction, whether or no you would really go on with your mock marriage. They saw you married, sat aside o' you at the supper, and then were convinced, that you was — exactly what you air!” “But where are you taking me?” groaned Jervis, as he was borne rapidly over a road, which led through a dark forest. “Wait a little while, and you'll see. Fanny and Ralph and your Dr. Baldwin, have gone ahead. They're expectin' us now.” “But Col. Thorberry will avenge this outrage!” muttered the Preacher. “I'll give you a hundred dollars if you'll go back to Thorberry's arter we're done with you: that is supposen' you can walk or ride, arter we're fixed you. Bless your soul, Thorberry, and all about Choktipaw will know all about you, to-morrow mornin'. It's only to spare you the pain o' layin' some years in jail, that we take you off in this way, and give you a touch of Justice in the rough.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINTH. THE END OF THE PREACHER. And the horsemen dashed on. Thus another hour passed away. At length the company came to a halt, and the bandage was removed from the Preacher's eyes. Placed on his feet once more, he gazed around, and found himself in the centre of a novel scene. It was a nook in the forest bounded by the the trunks of colossal trees, and shaded by their closely matted branches. Torches, held in the hands of brawny men, dressed in great coats and armed to the teeth, gave a red glare to the leaves, to the massive trees, the forms of the horses, and the faces of the spectators. Jervis surveyed these spectators, who encircled him on every hand. His heart leaped to his throat, as he recognized many of the planters, who had graced his marriage supper, not more than three hours before. And there too, were sturdy men, from Illinois, whom he had known during the life of Ellen Lester. “It's all up with us,” said a voice at his back — turning suddenly, Jervis beheld a half naked figure, very short and somewhat corpulent, whose uncovered back bore the red marks of a hickory rod. “I could'nt stand it, Jervis — they struck so awful hard — and so I owned up. You'd better follow suit.” The voice and the half naked figure belonged to the pretended Dr. Baldwin. “Aint you a purty pair!” the Preacher knew the voice, and turning, beheld the form of Ralph, clad in blue jacket and trowsers, with the tin box in his hand: “To go and run off with a couple o' orphans in this style! What do you expect will become o' you, arter the devil gits you?” At this point of the scene, another form advanced. The Preacher knew the face at a glance, and a fear, such as he had never felt before, thrilled him in every vein. It was Charles Lester. Pale, haggard, his head uncovered, and eyes deep sunken in their sockets, he advanced from the crowd, with weaponless hands, and looked into the Preacher's face without a word. The Preacher shrank back from that steady gaze. He could not meet the eye of Lester. “Friends, you have heard the story of this man's crimes,” said Lester in a voice unnaturally calm. “I have followed him for many an hour, and over many a weary mile — Edmund Jervis! we have met at last!” He made a sign to Peter, and Peter came from the throng of silent spectators, holding a knotted rope in his hand. “Mercy! Do not hang me!” cried Jervis, as his limbs gave way, and he sank to the ground: “This would be a murder! You dare not attempt it —” Peter without a word, tore the white cravat away, and arranged one end of the cord around the Preacher's neck. The other end he flung over the oaken branch which extended above the kneeling wretch. “Say the word, and he'll swing,” exclaimed Peter. “You dare not murder me!” shrieked the Popular Preacher, as he felt the rope about his neck: “Brother Markham, Brother Edmunds, Brother Finchley, you know me — you have heard me preach — you will not permit this outrage!” He turned toward the persons whom he addressed by name, and who had sat near him at the marriage festival. There was no response. The torch light only revealed a circle of stern and unpitying faces. “Mount my friends,” cried Charles Lester. Before an instant passed every horseman was mounted again — every one save Peter who stood beside the criminal. “We rest to-night at your house, friend Williams, which if I mistake not, is but a quarter of a mile distant from this place? The young lady whom we rescued from the clutches of these villians, is already there? Is she not?” The horseman whom he addressed, murmured assent, and the Preacher heard him declare that Fanny was sleeping in the mansion, not more than a quarter of a mile from the spot where he was kneeling. “If she was here, she at least would save me!” he gasped, turning his livid face from the light. As for the pretended Dr. Baldwin, he was borne in the arms of a sturdy horseman, who had determined — in accordance with the judgment of the company — to convey him some miles from the scene, and then set him free with the convict's stripes upon his naked back. “Are you ready?” cried Charles: “Extinguish the torches, and let us begone!” With one movement the torches were dashed to the ground, and the scene was wrapped in darkness. The sound of hoofs suddenly broke upon the stillness of the woods. “Spare me,” groaned Jervis, when he found himself alone with Peter — the rope about his neck and the oaken bough above his head. Peter did not reply in words, but drew the limb down toward his breast and tied the rope firmly around its rugged bark. When he released his hold the limb sprang back to its place, and the body of the Preacher dangled in the air. “I know'd Ellen,” ejaculated Peter, as he left the scene, and walked along the path by which the horseman had disappeared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue. Wiskonsan! Among the latest-born of the great family of American Nations, this young state by her code of humanity, shames the barbarous laws which yet prevail in the Atlantic States. Reader let us leave the Quaker City, and go forth together, into the free forests of Wiskonsan, where the blessing of God is written in every flower — where the breeze, that comes over river and prairie, is not tainted with the breath of the Great City's crimes. It is a summer evening, in the year 1848. Let us stand upon the brow of the rock, which overlooks the broad river, and drink in the wild beauty of the prospect, the calm fragrance of the evening air. The sky is clear, and the setting sun, bathes the woods and rocks which rise yonder, on the opposite shore of the river. Look around you — and tell us — what is it that meets your gaze. Gaze through the interval, which breaks the compact mass of foliage, on the heights of the opposite shore. It is a beautiful prospect. At the end of a green field, stands a massive house built of substantial logs, two stories in height and with a line of blue smoke rising from one of its many chimneys, into the sky. Behind the log-house, spreads a prospect of tremulous gold — a field of wheat, extending as, far as you can see, until your gaze is lost, in the blue haze of the distant woods. Skirting this golden prospect, a field of emerald green, also extends behind the log-house, and loses its verdure, only in the shadows of the distant woods. It is a beautiful prospect. A log-house built in the wilderness, not far from the river, shore, and rising in the very lap of fruitful fields — fields rich with harvests of emerald and gold. And on the distant hills, herds of cattle were grazing, their shadows lengthened by the setting sun. Let us cross the river. Let us enter one of those nooks of shadows and flowers, which are sunken amid the foliage of the opposite shores. There, seated on the sward, behold the owner of the house, a young and hardy man, whose rustic attire cannot divert your attention from the traces of thought and education, visible in every lineament of his face. Beside him, leaning on his arm, behold a young woman, whose beautiful face is shadowed by raven hair. Very plainly clad, and yet very beautiful, she is seated on the sward, with a child not more than two years old, upon her knee. This you will confess, is a picture full of interest and meaning. A young husband, a young wife, sitting in the shadows by the river shore, their faces turned to the western sky, and their hearts swelling with that peculiar joy and sorrow, which is produced by the sight of a calm sky, a broad river and lonely woods, all bathed in the glow of departing day. “Thank God for the free woods!” exclaims the Husband, after a long pause. The wife does not speak, but she takes her husband by the hand while her eyes fill with tears. As she compares the Present with the Past, so dark and troubled, her heart swells with a sensation of unutterable thankfulness. And while they are sitting there alone, the sound of footsteps resound among the bushes, and presently two new figures appear upon the scene. An old but hardy man of almost giant stature, and a young man whose lithe and active figure, does not indicate more than twenty-two years of life. They are dressed in huntsman's gear: with game-bag, powder-horn, and shot-pouch, and each one carries a rifle on his shoulder. As they come into sight, the old man — whose sunburnt face with white whiskers, beams with the good nature of a rough but honest heart — is telling to the young man, some story of adventure in the wild woods, which brings the fire to his large grey eyes. “It is Peter and Ralph!” cries the young wife in a glad accent. And in a moment the new-comers are seated beside the husband and wife, while the old man brings forth from the game-bags the fruits of their ramble in the woods. “We stopped at Marvin Farm in the course o' th' arternoon,” said Peter: “All well. Old Marvin, Hannah, her husband and the leetle boys.” “We were also at Cattermill's a little while,” exclaimed Ralph. “I wonder if Israel Bonus was alive again, whether he'd know John?” Ralph laughed at the idea. “Couldn't help thinking of Bonus Court, as I saw Nancy and her children sitting under a cherry tree, while John was busy with the men in the harvest field. Something of a change — isn't it?” Lester Farm, Cattermill Farm and Marvin Farm, are the names of three adjoining plantations — if we may use that word, in regard to free land, worked by free labour — and the owners of these farms, were respectively Charles Lester, William Marvin and John Cattermill. After his marriage with Fanny, Charles had purchased a tract of land in Wiskonsan, and divided it into three farms. One he presented to William Marvin, the other to John Cattermill, and the last he reserved for himself. “That Cattermill ain't the same man,” exclaimed Peter. “Don't you remember, Charley, when we first met him — but three years ago — livin' in Cincinnati, a poor, miserable sot, who depended on the labour of his wife for his support? You told him to pack up and come with you. He did that. You giv' him an object to live for. I wish old Bonus could rise from his grave and see John Cattermill as he is — not as he was. I do.” “And Marvin,” said Ralph — “He told me to-day, as we walked in the fields, that he had looked for God in the clouds long enough. `Now, my child,' says he, `I find him here, in these free woods.”' And this change had been accomplished by the agency of Charles Lester. Aroused from the lethargy of mental disease, by his love for the daughter of Alice Bayne, Charles had found development for his energies, in cultivating this tract of forest land, and in gathering the wandering children of civilized misery and landless toil, to a Home in the wilds of Wiskonsan. Marvin, Cattermill and Ralph, were by no means the only monuments of the redemption, accomplished by his kindly heart and active brain. And then as the evening begins to gather, the conversation turns upon the events of other days. Peter and the young husband begin to converse in low tones, while Ralph and the young wife look significantly into each other's faces. Ralph, completely transformed since we last beheld him, presses his sister's hand, while his chest heaves and his eyes brighten with emotion. Fanny, very pale and trembling, listens to the conversation of Peter and her husband, and silently returns the pressure of her brother's hand. “You heard that he was living?” whispers Lester, gazing into Peter's face, as it is warmed by the last rays of the setting sun. “Livin' and preachin'!” answered Peter 14 “The feller that we left hanging in the woods, has been a preachin', not two months since, in Fildelfy and New York. Thousands of souls—so the papers say — have been soundly converted under his ministry.” “He is alive!” ejaculated Lester: “I am glad of it! Base as he is, I would not have his blood upon my conscience. The worst punishment that you can inflict upon a man like him, is to bid him live!” “How did he get off the rope? That puzzles me. It's a reg'lar sockdologer.” “Shall I tell the story, Fan?” whispered Ralph to his sister. “Yes,” assented Fanny, blushing and trembling, as she felt conscious that she had kept a secret from her husband. “Well, Peter,” began Ralph, “Do you really want to know how the Preacher escaped?” Peter looked at him, in much surprise. “Of course,” he answered — “What do you know about it?” “I cut him down,” quietly exclaimed Ralph. “You cut him down!” was the simultaneous ejaculation of Charles and Peter. “Forgive me, Charles, it was my fault,” interrupted Fanny, laying her hand upon her husband's arm: “You remember that night, when I rested at the stone house in the forest — ” “While us folks was a-hangin' the Preacher? Yes. Go on gal,” cried Peter. “Ralph came into my room, after I had gone to bed, and told me the whole story. He told me that not five minutes before, he had left the miserable man, struggling with death, alone in the dark woods. I besought Ralph to hurry back and set him free. After much entreaty, he consented — ” “You had a hard time to persuade me, Fan. But I did hurry back and cut him down, just as he was kicking his last. And I brought him to, and gave him some money, and sent the poor devil on his way. Couldn't help it, Charley: Fan begged so hard, and then it was a shame to send him to the devil, before he had done all the devil's work.” “You are an angel,” whispered Charles to his wife, quietly pressing her hand: “You know not how many hours of painful thought you have spared me by this deed. Ralph! Your hand! It was a good deed, and I like you the better for it.” “Not quite sartin about its goodness,” said Peter, as if thinking aloud: “I've know'd many a rattlesnake of much better heart than that same Preacher. Hallo, Charley! I'd almost forgotten it. We stopped at the Post Office on our way home. Here's a letter for you.” Charles took the letter, and glancing at the superscription, beheld the post-mark of Philadelphia. He opened it, and held it toward the light of the setting sun, and thus managed to peruse its contents. “It is from a good-hearted but eccentric friend of mine,” said Charles — “A singular man, indeed, for he is a lawyer in tolerably good practice, and withal an honest man.” Philadelphia, June 16, 1848. My Dear Friend: — In answer to your enquiries, I hasten to state the following facts which I have gained, after some trouble, and not a little research. Goodliegh died without heirs. His property (that is what there is left of it) has been absorbed by lawyers, administrators, and police officers. The State took a, slice; another slice was swallowed by the United States as some compensation for Goodleigh's ownership of the Slaver, Falcon. In the course of legal investigations, made into this little affair of Goodleigh's connection with the Slave Trade, it appears that the foundation of his wealth was laid in a robbery of the Rev. Lemuel Gardiner, at a Parisian Gambling table. Lemuel you well know had no money of his own. All that he took with him to Paris, was stolen from the orphan children of Arthur Bayne. You may, therefore, come to the same conclusion with myself, in relation to “THE TIN BOX.” It belongs to the aforesaid children of Arthur Bayne. Tell Ralph to hold on to it. Goodleigh's mansion in Drab Row has remained in ruins ever since the fire. You have doubtless seen in the papers some account of the manner in which an iron chest, or rather an Iron Room, was discovered, in the cellar, buried beneath a heap of rubbish. The door was forced open, and two bodies, or wrecks of bodies, were found clasped in a close embrace. They were recognized as the bodies of Caleb Goodleigh, and Lemuel Gardiner. Odd kind of death for two such worthies — don't you think so? You make enquiries with regard to certain other persons whom you met, during your visit to Philadelphia, in 1843. Let me be at once succinct and graphic. 1. Dicky Bung — failed in business, cheated his creditors, and may be seen every afternoon in Chesnut street, dressed in the last agony of fashion. Mem: Lives by the “bones.” 2. The Squashahogany Copper Minino Com pany. Died with Goodleigh. Its members gone into other speculations. 3. Slinkum Scissleby, Esq. Still edits the Daily Copper, Copper still terrible in regard to French Novels, and prolific in obscene advertisements. You're familiar with the natural history of the Ostrich? 4. Stewel Pydglon, Esq. Alas for the vanity of human glory! Three years ago, Stewel was at the head of a virtuous fraternity, composed of Police Officers, lawyers and thieves. Now! Stewel's glory has departed. Read the Public Trials in the daily papers. Stewel is barely outside of the Penitentiary. Hoping that all this, will meet with your cordial approbation, I am yours, &amp;c. “So Ralph, the tin box is yours at last!” cried Charles: “You entrusted it to me, some three years ago. I will now give it back to you. What do you intend to do with it? It is of course, a separate matter altogether, from the property which you inherit in common with Fanny.” Ralph was silent. He grasped the hand of Charles, and with that silent grasp, spoke the full volume of his gratitude. By the light of the rising moon, the party ascended to the hill, and returned to the log-house, Fanny leaning on her husband's arm, while Ralph and Peter brought up the rear, with young Arthur in their charge. Once within the walls of their forest home, Ralph drew Charles aside, and whispered “The tin box — I'd like to speak with you about it.” Charles took a light and led him into a small room, which fitted up with some neatness, served as the library. Placing the light on a desk, which supported a small book case, Charles opened a drawer, and Ralph presently beheld the tin box — for the first time in five years. Charles watched him closely. Ralph's visage, entirely changed from its old-time look of precocious suffering and stolid defiance, was agitated in every lineament. He regarded the Tin Box for some moments in silence, his lip quivering slightly, and his grey eyes dilating with an intense light. “Open it Charley,” he said at last. It was opened. The bright surface of golden coin, packed snugly in that narrow space, glittered in the light. “Take it Ralph. It is yours. You can leave us, and go into business for yourself. Either here, or in some large city.” Ralph took the box and placed it under his arm. Fifteen thousand dollars in gold and bank notes, were now altogether his own. He left the room abruptly and passed from the house, followed by Charles, who did not know what to make of his movements. Once more in the moonlight, Ralph seized a spade, and hurried down the path which led to the river. When Charles next saw him, he discovered him engaged in digging a cavity, at the foot of a massive oak, whose wide arms overhung the waters. Charles watched his movements in silence. The cavity once dug, he dropped the Tin Box into its depths, replaced the earth and smoothed the sod, until it looked even and green as ever. “There Charley,” he exclaimed — “When I want to leave you, and go into business for myself, in some large city, I'll dig up that Tin Box again. Not before.” And as they clasped hands over the grave of the Tin Box it was resolved by Charles and Ralph to leave it rest there, until the year 1849, when (in case Ralph changed his mind, and desired to leave the free forest for the enslaved city,) it should be brought forth to light once more.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">A WORD BEFORE WE PART. You have now perused this Revelation of the Church and Home. It is to the Home, that we turn for consolation and repose, when our feet are weary, and our hearts are suffering. For the Home is the holiest altar which God has reared upon the face of the earth. Better that all the Churches in the world were levelled to the dust, than that the peace of one Home should be destroyed. But there are two persons who continually threaten the peace and too often destroy the sanctity of Home. The False Preacher and the False Physician. Entrusted with the confidence of every member of the Home, these men, every day abuse that confidence, and reward a blind faith, with treachery and outrage. Certain victims of the treachery of the False Preacher and the False Physician, delineated in the preceding pages, after many trials, survive this treachery and foil these traitors. But what says the experience of every-day life? Who shall count the families that have been sundered, the children that have been cast, helpless and stigmatized, upon the mercy of the world, the husbands and wives that have been torn from each other, the Homes that have been transformed into Hells, through the influence of these Criminals of Society — The False Preacher and the False Physician? In these pages you have seen one member of each class of criminals, delineated with the sincerity and the power, that always attends an earnestly spoken Truth. The previous work lacking the unity and compactness of a mere Novel, has claims to be considered as a History of Real Life. But there are other False Preachers, there are other False Physicians, whose crimes upon society and the home — crimes striking at the very heart of woman's purity and man's honor — demand a volume much larger than the present, a pen much more powerful than mine. In another, and a larger work than this, the task will be attempted. The reader who has traced the characters of Reuben Gatherwood and Edmund Jervis — these Iscariots who betray the Home, as Judas sold his God — will find other members of the same family delineated in the pages of a larger work, more extended in its plan, more exciting in its incidents, more comprehensive in its plot than the “Memoirs,” and entitled “THE EMPIRE CITY, OR NEW YORK BY NIGHT AND DAY.” THE END.</field>

THE ENTRANCED, OR THE WANDERER OF EIGHTEEN CENTURIES: BY GEORGE LIPPARD, Author of “Jesus and the Poor.” To be published, in one volume — price 25 cents. “A story extending over the space of eighteen centuries, and destined to create a deep sensation in the reading world.” “We should say one word here of George Lippard, author of `Jesus and the Poor,' a gem which we have transferred to our own cabinet. Whether he or the world know it or not, he is a true apostle — not made such, indeed, by the laying on of any fleshly hand, whether of Priest, or Bishop, with its solemn mockery of divine right and power, but called and consecrated by the spirit of God within himself, commanding him to lift up his voice, and plead the cause of those who have no utterance for the wrongs that are crushing them — to follow directly in the footsteps of his Divine Master, however widely it may diverge from the beaten track of such as rejoice in the wearing, or in the shadow, of cassock and of band, to impersonate the good Samaritan, though Priest and Levite pass coldly and scornfully on the `other side.”' —(Univercœlum.) III. THE EMPIRE CITY; OR NEW YORK BY NIGHT AND DAY. BY GEORGE LIPPARD, Author of “The Quaker City.” One volume, splendidly illustrated, and making 250 pages. Complete for 50 cents. (Extract of a letter from a distinguished literary gentleman to the author.) “Your greatest book is the Empire City. It far surpasses your world-renowned novel, `The Quaker City.' If you finish it as you have commenced, it will be, beyond a doubt the most absorbing novel of the Age.” (From another letter.) “New York is certainly the greatest city in America. It is decidedly Metropolitan in its character. In its streets will be discovered representatives of all the classes and races which have an existence on the American Continent, mingled with many others from the Old World. Thus New York furnishes more abundant materials for a great book, than any city in the world. It is the task of the Author, in `the Empire City' to picture New York not as it seems, but as it is. He traverses its huts and palaces, pictures its scenes by Night and Day and delineates characters from North, South, East and West, who are lured to the great city by every motive that can sway the mind of man. The great question of Trinity Church, which it is said will be treated in the pages of the “Empire City” will alone make it more thoroughly and earnestly read than any work of the age. The few chapters that have been published, display all the powers of a master hand: we look for the complete work with indescribable interest.” IV. THE SEQUEL TO THE MEMOIRS OF A PREACHER. BY GEORGE LIPPARD, Author of “The Memoirs of a Preacher.” One volume. Price 25 cents.
