      <field name="fulltext">“Entered according to the act of Congress, in the year 1831, by Richard Penn Smith, in the clerk's office of the District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.” DAVID CALDWELL, Clerk of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. I did but ask a kiss, and yet that boon Which she bestows on ev'ry morsel that Her lips receive, was scornfully denied. O! woman, thou art lavish in thy gifts To those who cannot prize them; but to those Who estimate their worth a thousand fold, Thou art a very niggard. —The Sultan. The American prisoners were confined in the Walnut street jail, and, as if in mockery, even the very building in which the declaration of independence was proclaimed, was also converted into a prison house. Joy was again in the camp of the invader, and `grim-visaged war had smoothed his wrinkled front, and capered nimbly in a lady's chamber.' Corwin, who was among the prisoners, suffered much from his wound and neglect. He was looked upon as a maniac, and too frequently we find that the loss of reason is attended by the loss of sympathy in the bosoms of others. As soon as man ceases to maintain an equality with his fellow man, he has little to hope for from his compassion. So it was with Corwin. He daily became more pitiable in his appearance, and frequently did he exclaim, in the language of the weeping prophet, `Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens. We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.' In consequence of his apparent imbecility of mind, after a few days imprisonment he was permitted to go at large. His mental disorder had increased during his brief confinement, but on returning to his usual course of life, there was a gradual improvement in the health of both body and mind. He had sighed for action, and being restrained in his movements, his imagination preyed upon itself. There was no outward object to relieve it from one isolated thought, that remained immovable, and burnt like a living coal. The morbid mind, when excited, finds relief from a corresponding motion in the body, but as this was denied him, there was every prospect of poor Corwin soon becoming a fit subject for a receptacle of maniacs. Timely release saved him from a fate the most appalling to those stricken as he had been. Mauns Talman was confined in the State House, with others captured at Germantown. He had too long experienced privation, to feel acutely this reverse of fortune, and as he never permitted more than one idea at a time to enter his mind, he was not much annoyed by unpleasant reflections. Your single minded man is a happy fellow. The thought with which honest Mauns now laboured, was of a nature to call all his powers into action. It was simply this. He was in prison, and the question occurred, how was he to get out again? It was a puzzling question, but it pleased our philosophical Swede so much, that he studied night and day to give a satisfactory answer; and what may not man accomplish when he concentrates his whole power upon a single point? The prisoners were at times permitted to walk in the public square in which the building stood, and 1* tradition tells us that it was not unusual to see them fed there as swine by their captors. Victuals was thrown down on the earth before them, and as famine compelled them to partake of it, their coarse meal was imbittered by the unmanly jeers and jests of those who had them in charge. While we recoil at the instances of barbarity recorded in the history of the earlier ages of the world, let us turn to the record of modern times, and philanthropy, instead of boasting of her triumph, should decorate her brows with a cypress wreath. The sun was declining rapidly in the west, and many of the prisoners were in the yard contemplating the beauties of a fine autumn evening. Among the number was sergeant Talman, but he was apparently too much engaged with his one idea to remark the splendor of the setting sun, or attend to the mournful dirge of the wind as it passed over the faded beauties of nature. He resembled Sterne's starling, and their constant cry was much the same—“I cannot get out,” said the bird; “How the devil shall I get out?” said the sergeant. In the midst of his reflections several soldiers entered the yard, bearing food for the evening meal. They approached where the group was standing, and emptied their baskets on the bare earth. A scramble ensued among the prisoners, which was considered highly comical by those who kept guard over them. Many a coarse joke was passed, and no matter how pointless, it passed currently, and elicited shouts of laughter, for those who are disposed to boisterous mirth care not upon what garbage they feed. When wit failed, practical jests were called in requisition, such as casting a piece of food at a distance, and tripping the poor fellow who hastened to secure it. Of all created beings, man is the only one that laughs; and it appears to be his constant study to excite this peculiar faculty. He treats life as a jest, and death as the same. With or without a cause, his laugh he must have. If other creatures were similarly endowed, what a noisy world it would be, for the welkin would incessantly ring with scoffs at the scoffer. But happily for man, he has the laugh altogether on his own side. Mauns stood at a short distance from the group, and made no attempt to secure any of the food. Indeed, he appeared unconscious of what was going forward. “What is the matter with that maypole, that he has no appetite for his supper?” said Gordon, who was among the crowd. His head was bandaged, and his cheeks were paler than usual. “He laid in abundantly yesterday,” replied one of the guards, “and you see he has a store-chest large enough to contain provisions for a week.” “He is of the kine breed, I suppose, and is chewing the cud.” “It must be the cud of reflection, then,” replied the other, “and I have never seen the man who grew fat upon that food.” This sally was accompanied by a roar of approbation. Mauns raised his head at the shout, without being aware that he was the subject of it, and the humourist approached him, elated with his sally, which he repeated. “How is it, friend, are you chewing the cud of reflection?” “Anan!” ejaculated Mauns, and the question was again repeated. “No,” replied the sergeant, gravely; “I am chewing a quid of tobacco.” Both cheeks were distended with the staple of Virginia, and his grinders were actively engaged. Another roar of laughter followed the reply, but as Mauns saw nothing to laugh at, he stared in vacant astonishment at their merriment. Miriam now crossed the square, and approached the spot where Talman was standing. “A fair prisoner, this,” said Gordon, “and better worth keeping guard over than the ragged rascals we are watching.” “I should like the post,” replied another, “and would be willing to lose an eye if she escaped my vigilance. Which way, my pretty lass?” “Can you inform me, gentleman,” replied Miriam, “whether there is among the prisoners, an officer by the name of Jurian Hartfield?” “I thought as much,” muttered Gordon, who overheard the question. “What kind of an officer is he, my pretty girl?” demanded the soldier. “A lieutenant, I believe, sir.” “That is no guide, for they all seem to be either lieutenants or captains, and it requires sharp eyes to discover a staff officer from a private, for they are all ragged alike.” “And brave alike too, sir,” replied Miriam. “Well said, my little rebel. But what sort of a looking man is this you are in search of—old or young?” “He is young, sir.” “That I might have sworn to. Go on with your description.” “He is light of frame, sir, with curly black hair, and a countenance dark and serious.” “And handsome, too?” “Some have pronounced him handsome,” replied Miriam, her eyes cast down. “And you do not find fault with their opinion?” “I see no reason why I should.” “A lover, on my life!” “O! no, sir, not a lover,” replied Miriam, and her pale cheeks coloured. “He is but a friend—nothing more than a friend.” “A happy dog in having such friends,” replied the soldier, smiling. “Can you direct me to him?” “There is no one here answering to your description,” replied the soldier. “Then I must seek farther,” said Miriam, and was about to depart. “Before I permit you to go, I must have the pass word,” said Gordon, approaching her. “The pass word, Mr. Jones, I know it not,” replied Miriam, trembling as she spoke. “Then you must remain my prisoner, or suffer me to whisper it in your ear,” he replied, taking hold of her familiarly. “Your prisoner! I do not understand you.” “I will soon make myself understood,” continued Gordon. “I never met with one so ignorant at your age. You have a tempting eye, faith, and a pair of lips that would make a saint turn sinner.” “This rudeness to an unprotected female!” “Call you it rudeness? I shall be as polite as it is in the nature of man to be, I promise you.” He attempted to kiss her, and a struggle ensued. The soldiers looked on, and smiled at the contest. “Are you ruffians—will you patiently witness such an outrage!” “Where's the use of being so coy with me, Miriam?” The soldiers, so far from interfering, only laughed. Truly may we say, in the words of the author of the Merry Beggars; `Are not all things, any thing, every thing, to be laughed at? And if nothing were to be seen, felt, heard, or understood, we would laugh at it too!' “Save me from this ruffian, if you have the feelings of men,” cried the affrighted Miriam. Sergeant Talman, who had been long contemplating the huge clock built by the side of the State House, was roused by her appeal, and now for the first time noticed the struggle. He recognised Miriam, and leisurely stalking to the spot, for the sergeant moved as systematically as a timepiece, he dragged the rude assailant from the trembling girl, and the next instant planted a fist, resembling a sledge hammer, between his eyebrows. Gordon fell, and a cry arose among the soldiery—“Knock the damned rebel down;” “Pin him to the earth.” Half a dozen bayonets were immediately presented towards the sergeant, and Miriam clung to him to protect him from his danger. Oaths and epithets were dealt out liberally, and the prisoners crowded around to protect Mauns. All was confusion; the only one who appeared perfectly calm, was the phlegmatic sergeant himself. “Make way with your bayonets—down with the rebels!” exclaimed several voices at the same time. They pressed upon the crowd, in the centre of which stood the sergeant, his tall lank figure towering above the rest, and Miriam still clinging to him. Three or four officers passed through the avenue of the State House, and entered the square during the excitement. “Down with him—stab him in her arms,” continued the infuriated guards. “What is the meaning of this confusion?” demanded one of the officers. He was youthful, graceful in his person, and possessed of a handsome and manly countenance. “A rebel has dared to strike one of the guards.” “And a dozen of you have espoused his quarrel,” replied the officer. “Bravely done! Was he not able to take his own part, that you are all up in arms?” “You would not have us stand by, major, and see a comrade trampled on?” muttered one of the guards. “No,” replied Andre, for it was he, “nor would I have you stand by and see an enemy trampled on. What is the cause of this disturbance?” “He but took a harmless liberty with that young woman, sir, and the prisoner interfered,” replied the soldier. “To protect a female from insult; was it not so?” “Why, sir, I must say, the young woman did not seem altogether willing,” muttered the soldier. “Then you have reason to blush at having taken part against her protector, and the ruffian may rejoice at escaping with a punishment so light.” He moved towards the sergeant, and the crowd gave way. “I admire your spirit,” he continued, addressing Talman, “and no prisoner shall receive insult or injury in my presence for asserting the feelings that become a man. You have done well.” “I thank you, major,” replied Mauns, “but master Jones does not appear to think so.” The refugee, who was known to Mauns only by his fictitious name, got up and stood by sullenly and silent. “Now, as he is not satisfied, I am ready to box him for a shilling, if you will only stand by and see fair play.” Andre smiled at the proposition. “That's reverting to first principles,” exclaimed M`Druid, who had entered with the officers, “and is a much prettier way of settling trifling disputes than any of your modern improvements. It's the way we have in my own native isle.” Andre turned to Gordon, and said— “I am astonished that this disturbance should have originated in one who has so much reason to cultivate a good understanding with his countrymen.” “I am not to blame, sir,” replied Gordon. “The liberty I took was perhaps warranted by my intimacy with the young woman.” The clock struck six, and Mauns counted every stroke on the bell, during which his attention was again riveted upon the huge structure. “It is time that the prisoners retire,” said major Andre to the sergeant of the guard. “Conduct them to the place of locking up.” This command was followed by a few strokes on a drum, and the prisoners repaired from different parts of the square to the centre building. They entered the avenue of the State House, and the doors were closed after them. Mauns Talman, as he slowly retired, endeavoured to comfort and encourage the still agitated Miriam, and at the same time he cast a lingering look at the clock, whose mechanism he had been so intently studying ever since he entered the yard. Gordon approached Miriam, and attempted to soothe her feelings. “Away, your sight is hateful to me.” “Dear Miriam, I did not mean to offend you,” he replied. “The intimacy between us should rather create confidence than fear, then why is it that you are always thus agitated when I am in your presence?” “Leave me; you are as the glossy serpent to my sight.” “Miriam, have I deserved this!”— “No more—no more!” “Hear me but speak.” “My heaviest curse would be removed, were I never to hear that voice again.” “Well would it be for thee, perverse girl, if there were no heavier curse upon thee than passes my lips.” His countenanee indicated that he meant more than his words conveyed. “What greater curse is there on earth than the presence of one we hate?” demanded the agitated girl, in a voice scarcely articulate. “Sometimes the presence of one we love,” replied Gordon, in a cold tone, while a malicious smile curled his lips. “Even such have proved a greater curse, to such as thee, than the worst enemy.” “To such as me!” “Your secret's known,” replied Gordon, in a tone that fell like a bolt of ice upon the heart of Miriam. “O, heavens!” she sighed, and hiding her face in her hands, her whole frame trembled. “Your secret's known, but confide in me, and your confidence shall not be betrayed as it has been.” She sobbed aloud, and Gordon continued—“You have fallen into the hands of a villain, and have therefore reason to distrust all mankind, but dear Miriam, look upon me with kinder feelings, and it shall be the study of my life to heal the heart that has been so wantonly wounded.” “Leave me—leave me—I would be alone.” “I cannot leave you, friendless as you are, and deserted by the world. My heart sicknes to think what your fate may be without a protector.” “I look for none on earth.” “Exposed to the scoffs of all, and broken down in spirit, you must sink before the obstacles you have to encounter. A friend offers to comfort and protect, and yet you turn from him with as much horror as if he had pulled down this ruin upon you. Is this justice, either to me or to yourself! Think more kindly of me, Miriam, and all may yet be well.” “Is there no one to save me from this man!” exclaimed the heart-broken girl, and burst into an agony of tears. The officers, who, during the foregoing, had stood conversing at a short distance, were attracted by her voice, and approached. Miriam recognised M`Druid, having seen him at Mr. Morton's house, on the night of the capture of Jurian, and she hastened to him. “Yes, you are kind,” she cried, “you, you will save me.” “Be comforted, poor trembler,” replied M`Druid. “No harm shall come near you. What is it you fear?” “That man—take me away from that man.” She shuddered, as she pointed towards Gordon with averted eyes, and M`Druid desired him to withdraw. He obeyed, and sullenly ascended the steps of the building, where he remained, looking at the group. “Whither shall I conduct you?” demanded M`Druid of Miriam. VOL. II.—2 “I came in search of one to whom you can best direct me, but I know not whether it is proper that we should meet again.” “Who is it you would see?” “Lieutenant Hartfield.” She blushed, and held down her head as his name passed her lips. “He is in prison—no friends near him, and possibly I may serve him. It is a sad thing to be in prison, without friends.” “If you desire it, I will conduct you to him,” replied M`Druid. “I know not whether I ought—and yet I have not the fortitude to say, I will not see him.” “Lean on my arm; it is but to cross the square, and your search will be at an end.” “I accept your kindness—you are unlike most men.” “Not much, my darling; but my heart and hand are always at the service of a weeping woman.” They walked towards the prison, and the officers followed, while Gordon from the steps stood gazing after them. As they crossed the square, Andre demanded of one of the officers— “Delancey, how long is it since you left the barracks in the north?” “Scarcely an hour,” replied Delancey. “Are the yagers prepared for the attack on Red Bank to-morrow?” “All will be in readiness at the hour appointed for crossing the river.” “Does Donop appear sanguine of success?” “When did he ever appear otherwise? He is a rough soldier, and partakes more of the boor than the gentleman.” “It cannot be denied, that he is better adapted to a darker age than the present, and his followers would have made themselves conspicuous among the Vandals or the Cimbri.” “It is proper that they are chosen for this attack, for as the rascals wo'n't fight without pay, they should be compelled to earn their wages.” “They are in the right,” replied Andre, smiling, “and have classical authority for becoming mercenaries. Even the gods Neptune and Apollo trounced Laomedon for cheating them of their hire.” They crossed the square, and when they came in front of the prison, an officer of rank was ascending the steps; they bowed to him, and he entered the jail. M`Druid followed him, with Miriam trembling by his side, and having succeeded in getting her past the guard, he made her wishes known to one of the attendants, and returned to his companions, when they pursued their way down the street. Gordon was still standing on the steps of the State House, ruminating on the result of his interview with Miriam. He felt that her dislike to him was inveterate, and that there was not the remotest probability of her sentiments undergoing a change. This conviction created a corresponding feeling in his own mind, and eradicated the slight degree of tenderness that he had entertained for her, though the personal charms of the poor girl still maintained their influence. His hatred for Jurian was also inflamed by the knowledge of the impossibility of weaning her affections from him. The crowd in the yard had now disappeared, save here and there a few straggling soldiers, who were released from duty for the night. Alice Grey entered, and approached the door where Gordon was standing. She walked as one who had been stricken by sorrow, with her tall form bent, and her head hanging down. She was dressed in a long gray cloak, and her face was concealed by the hood. As she drew nigh to the spot where Gordon stood, sullenly, leaning against one of the pillars of the door, she paused, and throwing the hood from her face, accosted him— “Am I too late to see one of the prisoners?” “The doors are closed for the night, and no one may pass the guard at this hour.” “I feared as much. Can you tell me how he is? Is his wound better? This is a sad place for an invalid to be confined in.” “Who do you mean, good mother? “Who should I mean, but Corwin—that much wronged and wretched man?” “He is no longer here.” “Not here! Where is he, then?” “That I know not. Major Andre, on visiting the prisoners this morning, perceiving the condition of his mind, out of compassion, procured an order for his release, and he is now at large.” “God reward him!” ejaculated Alice. “Compassion towards the afflicted will smoothe his way to heaven.” “Very likely,” replied Paul. “If you know nothing further of Corwin, there is another, of whom you can give me some tidings. I have heard of her being at 'squire Morton's, but she is no longer there. Where have you placed your victim? Where is my lost child, Miriam?” “No victim of mine, mother Alice; she is as innocent as the lamb unborn for me.” “Have you not betrayed her? Broken her heart and mine, and yet pronounce her innocent!” “Is it in nature to betray the being that we love? I know not how this slander has reached your ear, but in defiance of calumny I pronounce myself guiltless of the charge; but there is another, you little dream of, who will not be able to vindicate himself as easily.” “Another! what other?” demanded Alice, in a faltering voice. “Jurian Hartfield.” “That boy, who has been as dear to me as a son, and yet I knew not why my heart yearned towards him—to sting the bosom to death that cherished him! Impossible! It cannot be!” “The adder is sometimes concealed beneath a flower,” replied Gordon, his stern features relaxing into something like a smile. “Virtue is but a mask, that even villains may assume upon occasion, to betray.” “You wrong him; it cannot be!” “I will swear it is as true as holy writ, and call upon Miriam herself to attest to the truth of what I assert.” “So confident! Gracious heavens! if I have been deceived in that boy, I will abjure my species—there is nothing like virtue in the world!” “There is a great deal like virtue, mother Alice, but very little of the thing itself; but as times go, the counterfeit passes currently for sterling coin.” “What proof have you of the truth of what you assert?” “She was here but a few minutes ago in search of him, and even now is within the walls of that prison, where he is confined. I saw her ascend the steps as you entered the yard.” “My poor misguided child! Could we but meet again, I might reclaim her from her error, and save her from the fearful destiny that awaits her!” “None stray so widely, mother,” replied Gordon, gravely, “but that the right path is still open before them.” “Few return, who have strayed as she has,” replied Alice; “still will I hope she may be awakened to a sense of her error, and that her afterlife will cancel the remembrance of her present shame.” “Is that in the nature of man?” “I know not what I say! My own experience should have taught me that shame is a never-dying fire, upon which fresh fuel is daily cast, and when it has burnt down to the very embers, it rekindles among the ashes of the dead. It is a merciless world we live 2* in, and even the most sinful are ever ready to cast the first stone at the sinner.” “A merciless world, and a blind one too, good mother,” replied Gordon, “or you would not have attempted the life of your sincerest friend.” “I did you wrong, and I repent of it,” replied the humbled Alice, “but I was born to err.” “To return good for evil,” continued Gordon, “is a line of conduct that is attended with its own reward, and I wish to adopt it towards you. Miriam is fallen, and yet I cannot cease to love her devotedly. So far from it, her affliction has increased my tenderness, and in order to alleviate it, I am willing that her shame should fall on me.” “How fall on you?” “Let her become my wife. The knowledge of the author of her wrong rests in our own bosoms, and the shaft of slander will not be thrown at the wife of the humble Jones. Thus will she be saved from an appalling fate, and one who loves her be rendered happy.” “But her affections are devoted to another.” “And that other has betrayed her. A sense of duty will teach her to forget one so unworthy, and when this fatal infatuation is broken, gratitude will induce her to yield her heart to him who stepped in between her and ruin.” “I will think of it,” replied Alice, in a low voice. “Do so, and remember I live but for Miriam.” He descended from the steps, and they walked slowly and in silence across the square, towards the prison, together. Gordon was one of those who entertain the ideas of Solomon and David with regard to matrimony.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. 'Tis better to suffer treason, than act the traitor. —Rollo. Go seek the happier maiden, who lur'd thy love from me; My heart with sorrow laden, is no more priz'd by thee: Repeat the vows you made me, say, swear thy love is true; Thy faithless vows betray'd me—they may betray her too. But, no! may she ne'er languish, like me in shame and wo; Ne'er feel the throbbing anguish that I am doom'd to know! Leggett. The night that Jurian was apprehended he was conducted to the Walnut street prison, where he had leisure to reflect upon the misery he had entailed upon himself by his headlong passion. He felt that his motives in visiting the city, while invested by the enemy, were liable to be misconstrued, and he was fully conscious of the odium he had entailed upon his name by following the dictates of his feelings. He had betrayed the confiding Miriam, and increased the sorrows of her afflicted mother; forfeited the esteem of her he loved most, and totally destroyed his hopes of ever obtaining her hand. He had become the companion of a common robber and a spy; had been his dupe, and was now at his mercy, for he had sold himself to the enemy of his country at a time when she most required his services, and if betrayed, he must become a fugitive from the land of his birth. Such were his reflections on the evening to which we have brought our narrative, and he was pacing his prison, meditating on the darkness of the picture, when the chain of thought was broken by the entrance of the keeper of the prison, accompanied by an officer, whom Jurian recognised to be the same that presided at the council-board on the night he had entered the city. The jailor withdrew and left them alone. “I regret, Mr. Hartfield,” said the officer, “that you have experienced such harsh treatment among us. To-day, for the first time, it reached my ears, and I have hastened to tender any amends that may be within my power.” “Your lordship is considerate,” replied Jurian, “but you need not feel concerned at a circumstance that I have reason to rejoice at. I view my imprisonment as the most fortunate event that could have occurred.” “How fortunate?” “It has afforded me time for reflection, and calmly to weigh the magnitude of the folly I have committed. I have done so, and tremble as I contemplate the abyss of degradation from which I have escaped.” “You speak in riddles.” “And yet my words are plain. My lord, I am not suited to the office you have imposed upon me; and as my crime has thus far been confined to thought only, injuring no one but myself, I am resolved that it shall never assume a more hateful aspect by being put in execution.” “Am I to understand that you are false to the faith we have reposed in you?” “Rather ask, whether I am true to my struggling country, and I will answer.” “And what is your answer?” “That I would rather lay down my life this instant, than place the slightest obstacle in her pathway to freedom.” “So patriotic! Reflect, sir, you have gone too far to recede.” “Perhaps so. The step I have taken cannot be recalled, but I have not gone too far to stand still, and I prefer that position to the one you would persuade me to assume.” “Are you aware of its danger? You reject our friendship, and break your faith the same moment it is plighted. Under these circumstances, can you hope that what has passed between us will long remain concealed? and if you return to the rebel ranks, daily dread of exposure will render your life miserable.” “Not more so,” replied Jurian, “than daily to mingle with my countrymen, converse with them, feed with them, and sleep in their tents for the base purpose of betraying.” “And to escape from that position you are ready to become a double traitor; false to them and to us also. This bat-like policy is the most despicable that can be adopted.” “You have made me a traitor, and are astonished at the workmanship of your own hands.” “I am indeed astonished. You are an apt scholar, and are fit to take your degrees after a single lesson.” “The praise is due to my preceptor,” replied Jurian, sarcastically; “under different tuition, I might have been a long time in acquiring the proficiency I have already attained. In my turn permit me to offer a precept, which may be of service to you in future.” “I am all attention to so admirable a sophist.” “Never place confidence in the man whose soul is black enough to betray his country, for whenever he finds it his interest, he will deceive both man and God without compunction.” “And this sage corollary you draw from your own conduct?” “No, sir, my conduct has been the reverse, for I refuse to become the abhorred wretch that you would make me; and though you may regret the failure of your attempt, you cannot condemn the sentiments that have led to its failure. You are aware of the arts employed to entrap me; I acted from the impulse of the moment, and became the victim of my own feelings, but happily I have had time to reflect before I had gone too far, and while I labour to regain self-esteem, my contempt is increased for those who so basely conspired against me.” “I have said your reward shall be munificent.” “What is the wealth of the Indies to the slave who has sold his life, conscience, and every earthly hope for gold? I have received one bribe already, and my only consolation is that I was not polluted by appropriating it to my own use. It merely passed through my hands to those of your instrument—the base contriver of the plot against me. Still its stain is upon me, and I shall not rest until the amount is restored to its original owner, for until that is done we cannot meet on equal terms.” “Inexplicable man, I neither ask nor expect you to return the money. It is yours.” “No, sir, it is not mine, nor shall it be. I am unwilling to compromise my standing with any man. We all are equal, and he is a fool, who, Esau-like, sells his birthright for a mess of pottage. Suffer me to go at liberty, and the money shall be immediately returned.” “That I cannot do. You are either our friend, or our prisoner.” “Prisoner be it then,” replied Jurian, “for that, in the worst condition, is a better title than that of traitor in the best.” “How can the name of traitor attach itself to a man for an act by which he evinces his loyalty to his king?” “But when that king is not recognised, and his sovereignty is looked upon as a presumptuous claim, which neither the laws of nature nor man acknowledge—how then? Passion, sir, may at times lead me astray in spite of reason, but sophistry never on a subject so plain. My mind is made up, and is not to be changed by the erroneous views of others.” “You then consider the rebellion of the colonies as justifiable resistance?” “That, sir, is a weak phrase, and scarcely embraces my view of the subject.” “What stronger language would you employ?” “I should pronounce it tyrannical invasion on the part of the British, for what can be more preposterous than the claim of a small island, so far removed, to an extensive continent in a different quarter of the globe? The pretension is too absurd to be recognised for a moment, for the laws of both nature and man declare against it, and I should rather suppose the arrogant isle itself was originally designed for a province, and not for the lawless usurper over both land and sea, that she has become. But this is not the only instance in which the order of nature has been perverted by the visionary notions of man.” “In the intercourse between nations there is but one rule which has been reduced to a homely proverb—`might makes right,' and as this war must terminate in the reduction of the colonies to their former allegiance, it is useless to argue on the validity of your pretension to become an independent nation. The thing in itself is too chimerical, and the only hope that remains is for them to acknowledge the errors of their ways, before they have strayed too far from the path to return. The door may not long remain open.” “Still the stale prejudices of the old world! As to closing the door, we wish it closed, for it would be better for us to be shut out from you forever; and in return for the friendly advice you have given, I will presume to offer mine. Do not smile when I tell you to embark for Europe without delay—before your shipping crumbles to ashes on our coast, and the blood of your armies fattens the soil they have pillaged and attempted to render desolate.” “Pardon me, sir, I must smile, even while I admire your ardour.” “Then, sir, you will smile on when I predict that the time must come when this nation will give a tone to all Europe. It is idle to judge of the effect of this revolution from the result of those in the old world. Governments have been overthrown, one system has succeeded another, and the people remained the same moral agents, having effected nothing more than a mere change of masters. And this is readily accounted for—they received their tone from the nations by which they were surrounded, and it required too powerful a struggle for the mind wholly to disengage itself from its chains. With us it is different; we are removed from this influence, and are at liberty to think for ourselves—and what is the consequence? A spirit is already abroad that no earthly power can suppress— you may check it for a time, but it must continue its progress, and will not rest until the mind becomes regenerate, and freed from the mouldy and bigoted opinions that have been blindly handed down from father to son, for ages. When such a revolution begins, there is no foreseeing where it will end, for even sceptres and crowns must crumble before it.” “I deplore this misdirected zeal, for it is worthier of a better cause. I will take my leave, for while your mind is engrossed with these visionary notions, it is in vain for me to endeavour to reclaim you to a course that might tend to your elevation.” “By the neck, I presume you mean, my lord,” replied Jurian, smiling. “Reflect on what I have said,” continued the officer, “and when next we meet, I trust our opinions will not be so widely at variance. Farewell sir.” Jurian bowed, and the officer withdrew; and a few moments afterwards the jailor again appeared conducting Miriam, who, pale and still trembling from the fright she had undergone, stood beside Jurian in silence, the same passive and devoted creature she had ever been. “This is kind and unlooked for, Miriam,” he said, as the jailor withdrew. “I came to see whether I can be of any service to you,” she meekly replied, “for as you are deprived of your liberty, even I may be of service.” “I wished for a friend, and you have come opportunely. You have doubtless, ere this, heard of the disgrace that I have brought upon myself.” “I have not, nor do I desire to hear it, even from your lips. I have been so long accustomed to hear nothing but praise connected with your name, that I should now doubt my senses to hear disgrace attached to it.” “And yet, sooner or later you must hear it.” “But not now. Let that unwelcome tale be put off as long as possible, for it will reach me soon enough without your aid. You say I have come opportunely; what would you have me do?” “Can you find some one to bear a message from me to captain Swain or surgeon M`Crea?” “I can do it myself, and then I shall be certain that your messenger is faithful.” “You, Miriam! You are not aware of what you will have to encounter on your way to the army. The season is far advanced, a lawless soldiery are prowling in all directions, and an unprotected female to be exposed to insult and danger on my account! Miriam, I cannot think of it.” “I have no fears, if I can serve you.” “Find some other who will undertake it.” “I may—possibly I may. What message would you have delivered?” “Tell them I am not ungrateful for the many services they have already rendered me. Tell them, this favour may be the last I shall ever tax their friendship with, and that it is to redeem my honour that I again VOL II.—3 appeal to them. I blush to call upon their generosity again, but imprisoned as I am, I have no other resource.” “How can they aid you?” “By loaning me what money they can conveniently command. My honour, perhaps my life, is in pledge; to redeem that I call upon them, though the bauble is scarcely worth redeeming.” “On such a mission, Jurian, I could wish that the wings of the swallow were mine, for my speed will never keep pace with my impatience.” “How can I ever repay you for the interest you still feel in one so unworthy! one who has done you irreparable wrong.” “Suffer those thoughts to rest while they may,” she replied. “I have never blamed you, Jurian, nor do I. The fault was in the weakness of my own heart, and on it, alone, must the crime and the shame fall. I did not err from ignorance of the consequences attendant upon guilt, for they were daily before my eyes in their most distressing form—a mother's incurable anguish!— and yet I had not the virtue to turn from sin. I beheld how her mind had been prostrated, and knew there was but one course that could have wrought so complete a ruin in a mind like her's—at times I trembled to behold the fearful workings of her remorse, and with this lesson, daily before me, I have pulled down ruin on myself. I am to blame, and I only.” “Have you seen your mother since you left your home?” “Not yet, and may heaven spare me the anguish of that meeting, for there is nothing on earth I dread more. I cannot support the idea of being humbled in her sight, for such was her blind partiality, that she thought me incapable of error; and now to appear before her, fallen and degraded!—Kind heaven! spare me that pang—I shall never be able to bear the glance of her eye again.” “She was never harsh to you?” “All kindness and love! It is that, it is that!— Had she not been the best of mothers—did I expect to hear reproaches, I might bear all. But she will be as kind as ever—I know she will, though I have broken her heart. O! my poor mother!” “Return to her, Miriam, return.” “I cannot. I have more than once resolved to do so, but my soul sunk at the thought, and my courage failed. It is impossible, Jurian. Dear as she is to me, I shall never venture to see her more. Duplicity towards her, at a time when she thought me devoid of guile, was insupportable, and drove me from her sight, then how shall I stand in her presence, overwhelmed with shame! I cannot, I cannot!” Tears trickled down her pale cheeks, but there were no violent signs of emotion, for the channel had been so long open that they flowed freely from her wounded heart, without even a sob or a sigh. “Is Gordon acquainted with your feelings?” demanded Jurian. “Gordon! who is he? I know no one of that name.” “Poor girl! you know not then half the extent of his villany. I mean Jones; is he acquainted with your sufferings?” “I fear he is, for this evening I met him, and he appeared familiar with circumstances that I thought hidden from the world. But why do you single him out for such a question? A man from whom my soul recoils in horror.” “Is there no reason that he should be singled out, Miriam?” “None, unless it is because I fear him more than all mankind.” “And wherefore do you fear him? Should not his presence rather create confidence than fear?” “Confidence! There is a meaning in your words I cannot comprehend. He is acquainted with my shame, but how it came to his knowledge, I know not. You could not have betrayed me to such a wretch, and yet he knows it. Speak, Jurian, what covert meaning is there in your words?” “Should he not know it, Miriam?” “You torture me. Explain.” “Have you not deceived me in relation to that man; and notwithstanding your affected dislike, is he not even now in the full possession of your heart?” “O, Jurian! have I lived to be doubted by you!” “I have his word for it.” “His word! what weight should be attached to the word of one so unprincipled?” “But there is other evidence that carries full conviction upon the face of it; evidence than cannot lie.” “This is cruel!” replied Miriam, and burst into tears. “If you seek for an excuse to cast me from you, it is useless to resort to such means, for I shall not trouble you. Be happy where you may, I shall never bring a pang to your heart, or a cloud to your brow. Farewell.” “Stay one moment, and answer me, have you not written to him?” “Never; and there is nothing could have called forth so acute a sense of my shame as such a question.” “Then how did he become possessed of a letter from you, Miriam?” “A letter from me! I have already said I never wrote to him; then why trample on me to make me feel that I am as a worm beneath your feet?” “Reflect, Miriam, reflect.” The poor girl struggled for a moment with her feelings, and then calmly replied— “Farewell, Jurian. I perceive that I have lost your confidence, it is therefore time that we part, and I would to heaven that this interview had never taken place. Farewell.” “Before you go, answer me. Is there any means by which he could have obtained such a letter without your knowledge?” “I know not—he may have forged it.” “This was no forgery; I knew the characters too well.” Miriam's agitation increased, and it was some time before she recovered herself sufficiently to make a reply. “I recollect now—a few weeks ago I handed him a letter to deliver to you.”— “To me!” “I had not seen you for several days, and my anxiety became insupportable; I wrote to you, and sent the letter by Jones, who told me that he would see you in the city. He may possibly have kept it.” “He did, he did! Fool that I have been to be duped by so shallow an artifice!” “This then accounts for his knowledge of what I hoped was concealed, and I have published my own shame.” “Unprincipled villain! Justice shall yet overtake him, and I trust I may be the instrument she will employ. Miriam, you have relieved my mind from a painful burden.” “And you have cast an additional weight on mine, for I supposed I should still possess your confidence, though all the world distrusted me. But even that last delusion is at length broken.” “Thou deeply injured and betrayed one, I am sensible of the enormity of my conduct towards you, and abhor myself for having so long delayed to do you justice. But from this hour I cast off all other considerations, and as I hope to prosper, it shall be done.” “Justice—is that in the power of a human being? 3* Is there any act can restore me, even to the humble state from which I fell? There is none.” The calm countenance, steady eye, and low unfaltering voice in which she spoke, denoted that there was no hope remaining. “Are you not my wife, by the divine law, as firmly so as any human institution could render you? It is written, that `thou shalt be my wife, because I have humbled thee, and I may not put thee away all my days.' The obligation is positive, it is the divine command, and no human law can weaken its force.” “Still the decree is no longer recognised, and it is hard to believe conduct innocent in the sight of heaven, which man, with one consent, has stigmatised as criminal.” “It is not in the power of men to invent sins, Miriam, and then charge them upon the consciences of their fellow mortals to their condemnation before God.” “Few minds can sustain themselves against the opinions of the world, however fortified by a consciousness of right.” “And what is the opinion of the world! As well might we make the chamelion the standard of colour as human opinion the standard of truth, for it varies in every age and every section of country. The Hindu widow goes to heaven by mounting the funeral pyre of her husband, while the christian is condemned to everlasting punishment by committing suicide. And this is human opinion. Still, Miriam, the world is before us, and if our happiness is destroyed in one part, we can fly to another in search of it.” “But shall we find it there, unless we carry it with us?” “We shall be together, and while that is the case, Miriam, can we be otherwise than happy?” “That rests with you, Jurian. The time may come when the thought will occur, that for me you sacrificed all, and then you will weigh how very little I have brought you in return.” “Never, Miriam, never.” “A stranger in a strange land, without friends and destitute of the means of support, your present thoughts must give place to others of a less generous nature.” “Fear not that, Miriam; he is but a fool who starves with the wide world before him.” “And yet many starve with the world before them.” “But I am not that fool. While I live I will have my share of the benefits that nature has bestowed in common upon all, and when I die, I will venture to say I shall take as much out of the world as the wealthiest. Since I know not my parentage, I shall be true to my mother Nature, who will ever find me her own child.” “Visionary man!” “And what is the world but a vision, crowded with ideal beings whose real characters are never ascertained from the time of entering upon the scene until they pass away. Many a coward is looked upon as a hero, dressed in his laced coat and feathers: hypocrites as saints beneath their long robes, and fools in purple and gewgaw crowns, as demi-gods, until death strips them of their masquerading dress, and the poor players mingle in the tiring room upon a par together. The world at large is indeed but the archetype of the stage, where he who seizes upon the most prominent character, figures to the greatest advantage, and has the merriest time of it, until the curtain falls.” “And why are you ambitious of joining in a farce like this?” “Because the player is the only one who profits by it, while the mere spectator is cheated of his time and money. Yes, Miriam, I shall join in it for your sake, and the character I shall assume shall not be a subordinate one I promise you. I doubt not that I shall acquit myself with applause, stimulated by your presence, and again I shall see that pallid cheek glow, and that dim eye sparkle with delight, your mind throw off the cloud that now envelopes it, and my Miriam become the same bright being that nature had formed before the blight of the world had tarnished the exquisite workmanship.” “Enthusiast!” “There is much still in store for us. The stormy night may be succeeded by a cloudless day, and even the most desolate winter must give place to a blooming and joyous spring. Look forward, Miriam, it shall not be always winter with us, for our hearts shall peep forth as smilingly as the spring flowers when the snow wastes away, and their songs shall be as cheerful as those of the bluebird as he plumes himself in the vernal breeze. Look forward, Miriam; the birds, the trees, the brooks, the earth, the air, all nature teaches us to look forward, then do not close your mind against the inspiring lesson, for spring must return.” “The picture you have drawn is a bright one, Jurian, but unhappily there is one figure you have omitted. Agatha, where is she?” “That name, dear as it is to me, awakens the recollection of feelings that never can be revived. I can hear it now calmly, and while I repeat it, my pulse beats as temperately as ever.” “Still the spell is not broken.” “She herself has broken it, and pointed out the path I must pursue. Her innocent bosom would recoil from one stained with perfidy towards her own sex. My thoughts are changed—the hopes that led me to forget what is due to you have vanished, and I blush that they ever found entrance in my bosom. But they are gone—and henceforth I shall study how to heal the heart that I have so mercilessly wounded.” “Still the spell is not broken, for she is as dear to you as ever.” “She can never be otherwise than dear to me, but my feelings may change.” “And why should they change? She is as unspotted and lovely and innocent as ever. Your hearts have been intertwined from infancy, and her love is still as holy as in the days of childhood. Then why talk of change? No earthly power can weaken the ties between you. You may be sunk in poverty; steeped to the very lips in guilt, and she will love you still. Such is woman's love, while man can calmly talk of transferring his fickle heart from such a being.” “Miriam, hear me.” “Deal with my heart as you please, Jurian, for it is but a toy that you received as it were but yesterday. But do not talk of crushing feelings for my sake that you have nurtured for years, and watched over from the germ to the very hour of fruition—do not permit me to believe you capable of such an effort, lest I too should learn to change.” “Noble-minded girl.” “And why this sacrifice of two hearts—to heal a wound that knows no cure? You may remember, Jurian, the favourite hyacinth that grew in our little garden last spring.” “I do; the stem was broken by the storm.” “You may also remember that we propped it with care, and used every art to restore it, and still the flower withered and died.” “Miriam, what mean you?” “That I shall never hold up my head again in this world. Sustain me as you may, I shall droop as did that flower, upon which you tried your skill and failed; it is useless to try it again.” Her voice was low and unfaltering, and her dark eye steady and mild. She continued, “It is time that we separate. Farewell! Your mission shall be fulfilled.” “Miriam do not leave me thus; your voice freezes my very soul. And can we part with nothing more than a cold farewell?” “And how should we part?” “O, Miriam! and cannot your heart direct you?” “It is a lesson that it has not yet acquired, and one that it did hope it would never be obliged to learn. Farewell!” “No more than that!” “Again, farewell!” She slowly withdrew and closed the door after her, while Jurian stood petrified with astonishment at the calmness of her manner. She who had so repeatedly evinced the warmest affection and entire devotion to him, had parted from him, and perhaps for the last time, as if he had been a perfect stranger. Was her heart estranged from him? He knew that could never be; but passion had had its day, folly came next, and that in its turn gave place to despair. The most violent ebullition of feeling could not have awakened so keen a sense of remorse, as did the calm and collected manner of the heart-broken girl. Many minutes had not elapsed before a shriek was heard in the street in front of the prison. Jurian recognised the voice of Miriam, and on looking through the grated window, he beheld her in the presence of Gordon and her mother, who had awaited her coming forth. She struggled to escape, but the attempt was fruitless, and in a few moments they moved off together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. Bear him By word of mouth a single challenge from me, That, man to man, if he have honour in him, We may decide all difference. —Chances. Jurian was still looking out of the window after Miriam, when the jailer again appeared at the door, accompanied by a man enveloped in a tartan plaid. “This is the gentleman you inquire for,” said the jailer, pointing at Jurian. “Leave us,” replied the other, “I desire to be alone with him for a few moments.” The jailer withdrew, and the stranger approached the window where Jurian stood. “I presume, sir, you can divine the purport of this visit?” “I am not blest with the gift of divination,” replied Jurian, “but perhaps I might read your thoughts, had I a better view of your person.” “Am I so soon forgotten?” said the other, throwing off his cloak. “Colonel Lindsay! You are not forgotten, and I presume I am remembered too.” “Right, sir,” replied the earl, biting his lips—“and what do you augur from this visit?” “Neither good nor harm. Good I have no reason to expect, nor injury as long as I remain a prisoner.” “True; until we can meet on equal terms, it is my duty to suppress every thing like animosity; but the time is not far distant when we may meet as enemies should meet.” “Your mind, I perceive, is still imbued with your Highland superstitions,” replied Jurian, with a smile. “What superstition, sir? I do not understand you.” “You have faith in the number three. Well, there may possibly be a charm in a third trial that no one but a Scotchman could discover.” “You may discover it, sir.” “So confident in the spell! I shall be impatient until we put its virtue to the test— `Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd Thrice; and once the hedge-pig whin'd.”' “Shall I finish the incantation you have commenced?— `Cool it with a baboon's blood, Then the charm is firm and good.”' “Your wit is sharper than your sword, and of the two, the latter is by far less offensive; so, sir, I should be pleased to learn when we shall spill the baboon's blood?” “To-morrow at sunrise, if you are prepared.” “Impossible! how shall I leave the prison?” “Here is that will dissolve the bolts and bars,” replied the earl, handing Jurian a slip of paper which he perused. “An order from the commander-in-chief that I shall be released!— `Sponte suâ patuisse fores lapsasque lacertis, Sponte suâ fama est, nullo solvente, catenas,' says Ovid, and this is quite as wonderful. To whom am I indebted for this act of kindness?” “At my solicitation general Howe granted it,” replied the earl. “I shall begin to believe that you deal in magic, indeed. And in return for this favour you expect”— “That you will meet me as a man.” “Your wishes shall be complied with, for it would be a pity to disappoint you after the pains you have taken.” “Have you a friend among the prisoners, whose presence you would desire on the occasion? If so, name him, and I will contrive that he shall accompany us.” “You are generous, and I do not apprehend that you will take any undue advantage. All I desire is my own sword.” “It shall be returned. Young Morton is your friend, and it would be a satisfaction to me that somebody should act as your second.” “My friend! a pretty cabalistical word, containing about as much meaning as the abracadabra of the Syrians, and yet more pregnant with mischief than the whole vocabulary besides.” “You object to him, then?” “Not I; he will serve to look on as well as another.” “Major M`Druid will act on my behalf, and I feel convinced, from his sense of honour, he will be as much your friend as mine upon the occasion.” “Friend again, and in a different sense! A whole dictionary might be filled in explaining that little word! I am perfectly satisfied, sir, with the names you have mentioned.” “What weapons do your prefer?” “Not the broadsword, or possibly the charm of number three might be cut asunder,” replied Jurian, smiling. A slight tinge coloured the cheeks of Balcarras, and the other continued: “Pistols, I presume, will place us more upon an equality; you can, however, make your own selection, and give the charm a fair chance.” VOL. II.—4 “I have no objection to pistols, and as you have not a case of your own at hand, you can take your choice of mine.” “I accept your offer.” “Then to-morrow, at sunrise,” continued Balcarras, “I may expect you on Walnut street wharf. We will cross the river and fight on the opposite shore, that in case I fall, there will be no danger of your being overtaken and carried back to prison.” “You are considerate.” “Descend with me to the door, and there we part for the present.” They left the room and met the jailor in the passage, to whom Balcarras handed the slip of paper, saying, “here are your instructions, sir; this prisoner must be delivered into my custody; I am colonel Lindsay of the Highlanders.” “All is right,” said the keeper, and accompanied them to the gate of the prison which he unlocked, and they descended the rough granite steps to the street, where they paused for a moment, and Balcarras turning to Jurian, said— “We are now equals, sir, and I rejoice at it; but to-morrow will prove which is the superior.” “That I deny. It may possibly decide which is the better shot, but nothing more.” “Well, that is sufficient for me.” “The devil it is! I must say you have a vast deal of curiosity on the subject, to hazard your life to gratify it; for my part, I would not give five straws to settle the question.” “This is singular language, from one reputed brave.” “The truth does appear rather singular in these degenerate times.” “If such are your sentiments, why have you accepted the challenge?” “Purely out of courtesy to you. Society sometimes imposes heavy taxes upon those who are willing to pay them, and this is among the number. I should be voted a savage, unfit for polished life, if I did not cut your throat, or permit you to cut mine.” “You then reprobate this mode of settling quarrels?” “It is one that I would never willingly resort to, and perhaps shall never have the courage to decline. Still there are injuries to which we all are liable, and unless the injured party becomes his own avenger, the offender will escape with impunity. No man, it is said, should take the law in his own hands, even though his feelings may be outraged by a villain, and the law add to their poignancy by disavowing cognizance of the offence. This is demanding a vast sacrifice of natural privilege, and one that many are unwilling to concede. The social compact is founded on intellect and refinement of mind, and in order to secure its duration, it is necessary to protect the basis of the institution. Let us not be told that the law may not enter into the refined feelings of the party aggrieved, for to such feelings is society indebted for its proudest institutions, and without them, we should speedily return to a state in which brute strength would maintain the ascendency. As long as we are liable to outrages which the law cannot adequately punish, man will assume the character of the self-avenger, though laws be enacted for his punishment, and the consequent protection of him who called forth his vengeance. So, sir, farewell until to-morrow, when we shall discuss the subject with keener argument.” “Farewell, thou inexplicable being.” Balcarras wrapped his cloak more closely around his form, and bending his head to protect his face from the keen night wind, directed his steps down the street, while Jurian followed him slowly, at a distance, without having any definite object in view. It was now about ten o'clock, and the moon shone indistinctly, as the gathering clouds that were flying rapidly and low, obscured her brightness. At this period the dock was open from the Delaware to Walnut street, at which place a substantial stone bridge was erected. The creek above the bridge had already been arched over, and formed a street, as at the present day, while below it was uncovered, and at flood tide boats ascended the dock as high as the bridge. As Balcarras approached this spot, he was accosted by a hoarse and low voice— “I have been waiting impatiently for you.” He stopped, and raising his head from the folds of his cloak, looked around, but beheld no one. “Who was it spoke?” demanded Balcarras, but no answer was returned. He heard footsteps approaching, and a few moments after he was addressed by another voice from a different direction. “Why are you standing here alone, colonel, at this hour? Your mistress is not so deaf to your complaints, I hope, that you have come forth to tell your sorrows to the moon?” He turned, and beheld M`Druid by his side, who continued—“By my hilts, you have chosen a romantic spot, and the very place where your true lover may finish his business according to established rules, for if the fit comes over you, it is but to leap from the bridge, and you find a watery grave up to the chin in the mire.” “Ah! major, well met; was it you spoke?” “By the powers, what a question is that for a man in his senses! To be sure and it was, my darling. But where have you been since we parted?” “At the prison, in order to effect a meeting with that upstart, Jurian Hartfield.” “And how have you arranged matters?” “He is to meet me to-morrow, at sunrise, on the wharf, and then we shall cross to the opposite shore, where the career of one of us must close.” “That now will be beautiful; the affair could not have been better managed if I had had a hand in it myself.” “And before it is finished, major, you shall have a hand in it. But come along; I have a few affairs to settle, in case of the worst, and time presses.” They crossed the bridge, turned into another street, and soon disappeared. Immediately after a squalid figure came from a recess between the buildings, where he had been concealed during the foregoing dialogue, and also slowly crossed the bridge; after remaining on the opposite side a few minutes, as if waiting for some one, he proceeded down the street towards the river. He had not advanced many steps before he was met by a man ascending from the wharf. “You have come at last; I began to fear you had been discovered.” “Corwin, well met.” “You have overstaid the hour; what detained you?” “I have been endeavouring to find out the best means of escape,” replied Mauns, for it was he, “and have been as far as the headquarters in the north. The council has just broke up, and from what I can learn, there is some important movement on foot.” “Of what nature?” “That I could not ascertain, but from the bustle in the Hessian quarters, I conclude colonel Donop is to take an active part.” “Have you discovered any way by which we can regain our freedom? True, I am permitted to wander at large as a harmless being, and it matters little whether I am here or elsewhere; but with you it is otherwise. What can be done?” “As I came along the wharves,” replied Mauns, “I saw a man mooring a boat at the extremity of this street, and as the night is dark we may elude the vigilance of the sentinels, and escape by this means.” “I fear the attempt will be hopeless.” “I am certain it is the only sure way. The tide is high ebb, and I am a Swede and have faith in water.” While they were yet speaking, a man was indistinctly seen crossing the bridge, and slowly advancing towards 4* the spot where they were standing. They endeavoured to conceal themselves beneath the shade of the houses, but as he drew nigh the sharp eyes of Talman recognised Jurian, and he accordingly accosted him by name. “Who calls me?” “A friend,” replied the other, and advanced from his place of concealment. “This is a fortunate meeting.” “I should rather term it unfortunate, considering the place we are in. But, Mauns, how have you escaped from the State House?” “By means of the great clock at the gable end.” “The clock! how did that assist you?” “When they locked me up for the night, I crawled in among the works, and descended by the ropes by which the weights are suspended.”[1] [1] One of the worthies of the revolution stated to the author that this means of escape was successfully put in practice by a prisoner, he therefore trusts it may not be considered romance, improbable as it may appear. “An ingenious mode, truly. I presume you lost no time while you were in the clock,” said Jurian. “No, I lost no time,” replied Mauns, paying no attention to the attempt at a witticism. “The hand of Providence has brought us together, and will point out the path we are to pursue,” exclaimed the hollow voice of the mendicant. “Who is that?” demanded Jurian. “It is Corwin, the maniac.” He came from his place of concealment, and Mauns continued—“We are about to attempt to escape, and you, of course, sir, will accompany us.” “I cannot leave here at present.” “Nor do I know that we can,” replied honest Mauns, “but still it is worth the trial.” “The snares of Satan have encompassed him, and he fears to break the web,” said Corwin, in a solemn tone. “Are you on parole, sir?” demanded the sergeant. “No; but in honour bound to remain here until to-morrow.” “That he may spill the blood of a fellow mortal, or have the sluices of his own heart opened,” continued Corwin. “How have you learnt this already?” “The knowledge of it is not confined to me; it is known where it will be remembered,” continued the mendicant, pointing above. “Pause, ere thou art sullied with a stain that no tears can wash away.” “Impossible; it is now too late.” “And thou art prepared to go forth and do the deed that hath the primeval curse upon it. Obdurate boy, rocks have been dissolved to water, and steel become pliable, but who hath the skill to change the heart of man when it rises in rebellion against the laws of God!” The solemn manner of Corwin had an effect upon the mind of Jurian, who replied— “You may torture my feelings, but cannot change my purpose,” and at the same time moved off, as if about to leave them. “Ay, turn from me,” cried the mendicant, “for he who defies his heavenly Father, need not hesitate to treat with contempt his earthly sire.” The conduct of Corwin from the first had made a deep impression upon the mind of Jurian, which was increased at each succeeding interview. There was nothing definite to be gathered from the vague expressions that escaped the unhappy man, and though Jurian at times supposed them to be nothing more than the incoherencies of a man devoid of reason, still he could not wholly relieve his mind from the idea that there was a link which joined his fate, in some degree, with that of the wretched wanderer. But the nature of the tie it was impossible to divine. This idea now prevailed in all its force, and as the desire of ascertaining his parentage had long been an all-absorbing thought, as Corwin concluded, the young man clasped his hands, tottered towards him, and fell upon his neck— “Are you my father? Speak, O! speak, are you my father?” “I know not what I say. I am not, though the time has been when I would freely have given all that this world affords to have called thee son. But it might not be, and so my heart was broken and my brain was turned.” The moon emerged from behind a dense cloud, and shone full upon the face of Corwin, which was raised above, and indicated the acuteness of his feelings. “Speak,” exclaimed Jurian, “and relieve me from this agony of suspense: speak, do you know my father?” The whole frame of the maniac trembled violently; he burst into a wild laugh, which having subsided, he replied in a tremulous and guttural tone— “Know him! I have cause to know him. The angels of heaven have recorded my injuries, and the demons of hell have registered his crime in characters of never-dying flame. Know him! yea, as the victim knows the serpent that has stung him.” “My mother; speak to me of my mother.” Corwin shrunk from him, while a convulsive sob for a few moments obstructed his voice, and he replied, in the utmost agitation— “Peace, thou poor unfortunate, ere you set my death-wound bleeding afresh, and call forth the curse of the child upon the grey head of the parent.” “My mother; speak to me of her. Does she still live? “If to endure the unceasing gnawings of remorse can be termed living, she lives, but only to undergo in this world, the sufferings of the world to come.” He stared vacantly at Jurian, and laughed wildly. “If this be living, I am among the living too; I am not ready for the grave yet, though dead to all creation save myself.” “In mercy speak.” “No; I am not ready for the grave yet, though I marvel how the earth can bear one so wretched. I have endured enough to crush a giant's strength, and still I am not ready for the grave. Pour on, pour on; what additional weight must I endure!” He tossed his arms, and strode rapidly to and fro along the pavement. “Guide me to my mother,” continued Jurian, “though the most miserable outcast, she is still my mother, and as such I will reverence and cherish her.” Corwin raised his hands, clenched them across his forehead, and after remaining in this posture silent for some time, abruptly exclaimed— “My brain aches to bursting; the whirlwind is there, and the rush of thought comes on in terrible array. Action, action, or I shall go mad.” He took a few hasty strides towards the river, and Jurian followed him. “Do not leave me yet,” he exclaimed, clinging to him; “My fate is in your hands; do not leave me yet.” “I must move, I tell you, or I shall go mad. Release your hold—I will not be stayed, for I am my own master yet—free to think and act, wild as my thoughts and deeds may be, and when they get beyond bounds, why whips and chains will bring me to reason again. Ha! ha! ha! a rare way that, a cunning way, indeed. Whips and chains! whips and chains! Ha! ha! ha!” “For pity's sake, satisfy my doubts.” “Off, I say, I'll not be restrained. You are not my keeper yet; not yet; off, off, and let me depart, for I will harm no one, not even a worm.” He broke from Jurian's hold, and hurried towards the river; the young men followed, and in a few moments they descended the hill that originally formed the western bank of the majestic Delaware. A sentinel was pacing the wharf with measured tread; as soon as Mauns discovered him, he darted forward and arrested the progress of Corwin, who was advancing without being conscious of the danger of a discovery, and they concealed themselves behind a flight of steps which ascended from the street to the second story of a building. By this time an unceasing roll of the drums from the northern part of the town, and the creaking and plashing of oars was heard upon the water. As the moon emerged like a fairy bark from the ocean of clouds which almost continually obscured her brightness, barges, with soldiers on board, were indistinctly seen passing to the Jersey shore, while others, empty, were returning to the Pennsylvania side. The sentinel occasionally paused to contemplate this movement, without being able to form any conjecture as to its meaning. Mauns watched his opportunity, and while the sentinel's face was turned up the river, intent on what was passing in that quarter, he darted rapidly forward, and by clinging to the wharf, let himself drop lightly into the skiff that lay moored in the shade, out of the view of the soldier. Jurian's thoughts were now confined to a single channel. He was on the eve of drawing the veil from the mystery that had preyed upon his mind for years, and all other considerations were absorbed in that single thought. The moment had arrived, and if suffered to pass it might never occur again, he therefore determined to follow Corwin, until his doubts should be fully satisfied. As a dense cloud obscured the face of the moon the sentinel resumed his heavy tread, but paused again when the moon reappeared. Jurian now followed the example of Mauns with equal success, and seated himself in the bottom of the skiff, in obedience to the instructions of the other. The greatest difficulty still remained to be achieved, for Corwin was not yet on board, and even should he succeed in passing the sentinel, how should they get afloat without being detected? All the wharves were guarded, and should they suffer the boat to be borne along by the tide without the use of the oar, they would run great hazard of being taken or fired upon before they passed the southern boundary of the city. Honest Mauns was sorely puzzled to devise a plan to surmount these difficulties, as he sat ruminating beneath the shadow of the wharf. The curiosity of the sentinel was still attracted by the movements in the north, and at intervals he paused to scrutinize into what was going forward. Corwin availed himself of a favourable opportunity to emerge from his place of concealment, but before he had reached the edge of the wharf the sentinel turned and discovered him, and commanded him to stand. He obeyed, for it was now too late to attempt to escape. “What are you doing here?” demanded the sentinel. “Looking out upon the heavens and the water,” replied Corwin, “for there is no sight in nature so well calculated to calm the troubled mind.” “By the powers,” exclaimed the sentinel, “if you were stationed here for three hours at a stretch, I am thinking you would be after changing your opinion. But stand back; this is neither time nor place for star-gazing.” “I am a harmless man,” replied Corwin, “and would but read the book that nature has unfolded to the gaze of all. Do not drive me from my study.” “Faith, master philosopher, you must study elsewhere, so retire within the line.” “Come with me, and I will read to you the wonders of that immeasurable scroll. What a work is there for the study of man! since every step he takes opens a new field to explore, and though his brief life were extended to the end of time, and he had hourly studied, until he believed that he had mastered the mysteries of the universe, still he would find that with all his labour he had scarcely taken a drop from the fountain of knowledge. Come with me.” “And what for,” demanded the sentinel, “should I study that same book, which from your own showing I may not understand?” Mauns raised his head above the edge of the wharf to ascertain what was going forward, and Corwin's quick eye no sooner perceived him, than he called the attention of the sentinel to an opposite direction. “Behold that star in the west, that brilliant star, just above the horizon, that shines forth as a queen amidst her satellites. Move this way, and you will see the star I mean.” “Botheration, now, and don't I know her as well as I do my own mother's son? She's one of the planters; but by the powers, master philosopher, if you were to see the stars we have in sweet Ireland, you would be ashamed of this blarney about your rushlights here. The smallest among them is as big as your moon, and bigger too. Such a twinkler as that now, wouldn't be noticed at all at all. But this is a new country, and the like may answer until it becomes thickly settled; but when your population thickens it will never do. Of a dark night now, you will be beautifully bothered to find your way with nothing more than a firefly-lamp like that to light you. Don't come over me, I say, with the pride of your stars, for even your moon itself is as dull as a pewter pint-pot.” During this bravado of the sentinel his back was turned towards the river, and Corwin made a sign to Mauns to push off with the boat, as he himself had abandoned all hope of escaping by that means. Mauns understood the signal, and lost no time in fixing the oars and cutting the rope by which the boat was secured. This was attended with some noise, which attracted the notice of the sentinel, and the boat no sooner emerged from the shade than he discovered and hailed it. Mauns returned no answer, but seated himself and seized hold of the oars. “Hold on, and give the word,” cried the sentinel, “or by all the saints in the calendar, I will blow you out of water.” “The king,” returned Mauns, who had fortunately overheard the man who left the boat give the word as he landed. “Right,” replied the sentinel. “What is the meaning of all this commotion in the upper part of the town; have you heard?” “The yagers are under marching orders,” replied the other, at the same time dashing his oars lightly into the water. “You told me you were colonel Lindsay's servant. Has he a command in this expedition?” “No; his quarters are too comfortable. Good night,” which reply was accompanied by a second pull at the oars. “Hold on. Who is that with you?” “A friend.” “But what has become of your brogue, Sawney? demanded the sentinel, who perceived that the voice was different from that of Lindsay's servant: “By the mass it was as thick as my leg not half an hour ago, and now you speak as clear as a whistle. Hold on, and tell me what you have done with your brogue, man.” Mauns made no reply, but pulled away at the oars. “Hold on, I say, or I shall pepper your jacket.” As this threat failed to arrest the progress of the skiff, the sentinel raised his gun to put it in execution, when Corwin, who had stood near him during the foregoing, intent on the result, sprang forward and seized the gun, as it was elevated to his shoulder. The soldier, thus taken by surprise, was soon disarmed, and Corwin threw the gun to the ground, when a scuffle ensued, the result of which was doubtful for some moments, VOL. II.—O the sentinel having the advantage on the score of activity, which was counterbalanced by Corwin's superior strength and stature. Fortune, however, soon decided in favour of the latter. The contest took place near the edge of the wharf, and the sentinel, in endeavouring to disengage himself from the grasp of Corwin, made a sudden and powerful effort to break from him, which was successful, but unluckily his impetus was so great that he could not check it before he reached the river. He no sooner arose to the surface of the water than he cried out lustily for assistance, and Corwin perceiving that he was a good swimmer, and in no danger, darted up the street by which he had descended, and soon disappeared. Mauns, in the mean time, made the light skiff glide over the water as though it had been a creature of the element, and the sentinel having regained the wharf, clambered up, muttering imprecations upon the head of the star-gazing philosopher. His cries for assistance had by this time brought several soldiers to the spot, and as the boat was still in sight, the cause of the alarm was soon made known, notwithstanding the confusion into which the passion of the Hibernian had thrown his ideas. As he stood dripping on the wharf, he urged his comrades to search for the star-gazing philosopher, as he termed Corwin, and seemed to consider the escape of the prisoners in the boat a matter of minor importance, provided he could be found. The moon also came in for a share of his ill humour, and he protested that the accident would not have occurred had she only shown as bright as a tin saucepan, that he might have seen what he was doing; and then he deplored the condition of the country, being so badly lighted, and protested roundly that as the population increased, we should never be able to get along at all, of cloudy nights, without sending to Europe to get a new moon manufactured. Many were long of the sentinel's opinion with regard to every thing else but the moon. The alarm having passed from one sentinel to another, boats were seen putting off from different wharves in pursuit of the fugitives, and at intervals a gun was fired in order to arrest their progress, but it had a contrary effect, and made Talman redouble his exertions. As he heard the creaking of oars in his wake, he remarked in a tone that approximated boasting, that he must be a skilful waterman who overtook them, for he could feather an oar with any man on the river, wind and tide favouring. Before they had passed the southern boundary of the city, half a dozen boats had commenced the pursuit, and an occasional shot was fired after them by the sentinels on the wharves. Fortunately the tide was ebbing rapidly, the skiff was a light one, and Mauns had not boasted of his skill at the oar without reason, for the little vessel glided over the surface with all the buoyancy of a water-fowl, while the lumbering barges were labouring wearily after her. Scarcely a sound was heard to proceed from the oars as they were lightly dipped in the water by the skilful Mauns, while those of the barges creaked lazily on their pivots at every stroke that was taken. It was not long before Mauns had outstripped his pursuers, and they were lost sight of in the obscurity of the night, still the creaking of the oars, borne by the breeze over the surface of the water, denoted that they were following in his wake. For half an hour the chase continued, but as there was no sound to guide them in the pursuit, they paused, and after a short consultation, turned their boats and pulled against the tide for the city. The quick ear of Mauns caught the sound, and understanding the movement he relaxed in his exertions, at the same time remarking, with an air of triumph, that they might as well send a buzzard after a red-neck, as such lubbers in pursuit of a Swede on the water. Mauns was not much given to boasting, but he prided himself upon his skill at the oar, and at times he was disposed to make known that he considered himself a little superior to any other in this branch of science. This was an excusable piece of vanity in Mauns, and one that he shared in common with the rest of mankind, for most of us imagine we possess some faculty peculiar to ourselves, and he who can balance a pole upon his nose, or eat six pounds of bacon at a meal, boldly challenges the admiration of all, and considers himself the eighth wonder of the world. Jurian during their progress down the river remained silent, for he had failed in the accomplishment of that which he most earnestly desired. His hopes had been defeated by the absence of Corwin, and when he perceived that there was no prospect of his getting on board the boat, his first impulse was to spring on shore, and remain with the mysterious man, with whose fate he believed his own to be intimately connected. This feeling was, however, checked by reflecting that by so doing he would totally defeat honest Talman's prospects of escape, and that no personal consideration would justify a step of the kind. He accordingly remained passive. The following morning at the time appointed, Balcarras and his two friends were upon the wharf, where they waited impatiently for about an hour, at a loss to account for the tardiness of the other party. “What can it mean?” demanded Balcarras. “It cannot be possible that he has become craven.” “My life on it, his courage is not to be questioned,” replied Morton. “You may say that,” replied M`Druid, “and if questioned, it is not here to answer it.” “There is no sign of the boat, and yet Sawney protests that he moored it safely at the wharf,” said Balcarras. The servant called half a dozen saints to bear witness to the truth of what he asserted, and again pointed out the spot where he had secured it. “It is all very comical, by my hilts,” exclaimed M`Druid, and having grown weary of waiting, they returned to their breakfast with rather an unfavourable opinion of the honour and courage of the young American, though with a much better appetite for their meal than if they had found him at the place appointed. Physiologists agree that there is nothing that tends so completely to the destruction of appetite as a duel before breakfast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5* CHAPTER IV. “Soldiers! those German gentlemen are bought For four pounds eight and seven-pence per man, By England's king—a bargain, as 'tis thought. Are we worth more? Let's prove it now we can— For we must beat them, boys, by set of sun, Or Mary Stark's a widow.”—It was done. —Halleck. “We are once again beyond the reach of the red jackets,” said Mauns, resting on his oars, as he heard the barges returning, “and though a polished set of gentlemen, I am not sorry to be rid of their company.” “I rejoice in your escape, Mauns, more than I do in my own,” replied Jurian, “for gladly would I be in my prison again.” “That is strange! your prison must have been more comfortable than mine was, or you would never express a wish of that nature. For my part I am perfectly satisfied where I am, and they will not catch me among them again with my own consent.” “And now I have had time to reflect,” said Jurian, “my escape may be the means of saving myself. True, I have been disappointed in what was nearest my heart, but I may procure the means of redeeming my honour, and as to Balcarras, another time may occur.” This was all unintelligible to Mauns, and was spoken in a tone that betrayed that he was rather communing with himself than addressing another. When Jurian perceived that poor Miriam had fallen into the hands of her mother, he abandoned the hope that she would be able to fulfil the mission she had undertaken, but as he now had it in his own power, he felt less chagrin at the absence of Corwin, and being obliged to leave his honour in the hands of Balcarras. Talman still rested on the oars, and suffered the boat to float with the tide. “You have overexerted yourself, sergeant,” said Jurian; “permit me to take the oars.” “My wound pains, sir, a little,” replied Mauns, “or I would not give my seat up to the best boatman on the water.” “I am familiar with your skill,” replied Jurian, “for many a time have we been fishing and duck-shooting together, it is therefore useless to make a display before me at the risk of your health; so exchange seats, my good fellow.” “Those were happy times, sir,” replied Mauns, seating his tall figure in the stern of the boat, while Jurian took charge of the oars. “Those were happy times, indeed. There was but one man in all Tinicum could pull an oar with me. You remember Aoki Shell; a smart fellow was that Aoki!—he understood drawing a seine, and was a pretty good shot at fifty yards, but then he was wonderfully given to bragging.” “The sheldrake he shot from the Point in the season of '66 made a good story, and he spoke of little else throughout the year,” replied Jurian. “You havn't forgot the sheldrake. What a famous story he made of it by the time he was done.” “I remember,” replied Jurian, “the fifty yards had extended to one hundred and fifty, and the drake had grown to a swan. But what has become of him?” “From that day he set up for a marksman,” continued Mauns, “and considering the game in these parts too small for a shot like himself, he sold his boat and the few things he had gathered around him and started for the back settlements, with no property but his rifle on his shoulder. He since wrote to me that he was doing well, and was the best shot within fifty miles of him.” “That's the way with us all,” said Jurian, “we are never at rest until we have the reputation of doing something better than our neighbours, and he is a happy man, indeed, whose ambition is fully gratified in being the best shot in a village. Armies have been slaughtered, and kingdoms overthrown, to attain a distinction which, in the end, amounted to little more than this. No one is willing to stand upon a line with his fellows. From the monarch down to the beggar, we scarcely meet with one who is not possessed of some peculiar faculty for which he challenges the admiration of mankind. The king fills his throne with unrivalled dignity; another bestrides a horse with superior grace; a third will hop ten feet backwards; and the poor beggar who lives on common charity, when every other source of pride is destroyed, will boast that he can catch his vermin with greater skill than another.” Jurian now plied the oars briskly and with skill, and as they glided along, Mauns repeatedly reminded him that he had acquired the art under his tuition. As the tide was in their favour it was not long before they arrived in front of fort Mercer, upon Red Bank, at that time under the command of colonel Green. As they were stepping ashore, they were hailed by the sentinel who was seen by the moonlight pacing on the outworks of the fortification above. Jurian answered him, and stated that they were prisoners who had just escaped from the city and wished to gain admittance into the fort, as they had information of importance to communicate. In a short time a guard came from the fort, and the prisoners, in compliance with their wishes, were conducted to the commander, and immediately recognised to the friends by several of the soldiers. Jurian made known that the enemy had an expedition on foot, but to what point it was directed, he was unable to say with certainty; but they had ascertained that the troops were forming upon the Jersey shore, under the command of colonel Donop, and fort Mercer was as liable to the attacked as any other strong hold, as the British army could not have a free communication with the fleet, as long as this place, and fort Mifflin, on the island opposite, remained invested by the Americans. Of this colonel Green was aware, and plainly foresaw that an attempt would shortly be made to dislodge him: but as he knew the importance of his station, he determined to hold out to the last extremity. A boat was speedily launched, and the report communicated to colonel Smith, the commander of fort Mifflin, who disposed of his slender forces to the greatest advantage, as he hd every reason to apprehend that in case of an attack, a desperate and bloody conflict would ensue. At a late hour the following day, a strong detachment of Hessians was seen marching along the eastern bank of the river, until they arrived in the rear of fort Mercer, where they halted, and formed a line of battle. The Americans witnessed the formidable array with considerable emotion, which was not abated, when they beheld a flag approaching, with a demand to surrender the fort in the most peremptory terms. Colonel Green replied— “I shall defend the fort to the last extremity.” “Your walls are unfinished and unmanned,” said the officer, taking a view of the imperfect ramparts. “The less blood will be spilt upon the occasion,” replied Green. “What answer shall I bear?” “Tell your commander, if he wants the fort, he must fight for it, and fight bravely.” The officer with the flag turned his horse and galloped toward the main body, and having reported the answer, concluded with stating that the garrison was very small, and the outworks not half completed. This information increased the hopes of the rugged Donop, and in a short time the attack commenced, when the Americans, finding their number too small to man the outer intrenchment with effect, in consequenc of its extent and unfinished state, after a vigorous resistance, withdrew into the bodyof the redoubt, whichh afforded a better covering. The Hessians perceiving the fire from the outward battery to abate, pushed forward, and mounted the rampart, when a joyful shout denoted that they imagined they had obtained an almost bloodless victroy; but a sharp discharge of musketry soon dissipated the idea, and presented a new aspect of the affray, for numbers reeled from the breastwork into the ditch beneath, where they perished. Disappointment aroused the determination of the assailants, who pressed on, to avenge the death of their comrades. Thhe conflict every moment became more sanguinary, and count Donop, who was charging with great intrepidity at the head of hhis forces, was wounded and taken prisoner, when thhe Hessians fell back in dismay, but were soon rallied again by colonel Mingerode, the second in command. They marched to the charge withh unfaltering step, and were met with equal determination by the Americans. The rattling of musketry was now unceasing, which was occasinally drowned in the deep thunder of the cannon, rolling across the river, for the attack upon fort Mifflin had also commenced with spirit. As colonel Mingerode had received a dangerous wound, and several of his best officers were either killed or disabled, confusion prevailed throughout the ranks of the Hessians, and after sustaining a loss of five hundred men, they were obliged to retreat precipitately; in doing which they suffered severely by the fire of the American gallies and floating batteries. A brisk cannonading was still kept up on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware, between fort Mifflin and a portion of the British fleet. The shipping, in consequence of the obstructions which the Americans had sunk in the bed of the river, had much difficulty in reaching the post assigned them, from which they poured in incessant and heavy fire. The shades of night were now rapidly approaching, and from fort Mercer the black hulks of the ships of war were imperfectly traced on the deep gloom that lay beyond in the west, except at intervals, when the blaze of a broadside, like a flash of lightning, illuminated the spot for a moment, and then passed away, leaving the darkness more impervious than before. The garrison at Red Bank were anxious spectators of the scene, for whatever mighht be the result, it was out of their power to participate effectually in thhe engagement. Still an occasional shot was sent booming over the water, to proclaim to their friends the interest they felt, rather than as a messenger of ill to the enemy. Jurian and his companion were contemplating from the breakstork of the fort the interesting conflict, and though fatigued by their exertions to repulse the attack of the yagers, still they were impatient to play a part in the stirring scene before them. “We came, sir, in good time to be of service,” said Mauns. “This, now, is much better than lying idle in the enemy's quarters.” “Much better,” replied Jurian, without turning his eyes from the scene of carnage. “I should like to be among them,” continued Manus, “for I am thinking my skill at the oar might come in play before it is over, and I should be proud to show them how to manage a boat on suc an occasion.” Jurian smiled at the remark of the hhonest Swede but made no reply, while the othher leisurely stretched his long limbs upon the rampart, and supporting his head upon his right hand, contemplated the battle in silence. “That shot was well directed,” exclaimed Jurian, as several pieces were simulataneously discharged from the fort on the island. “Every grape told, I'll warrant you,” responded Mauns. “It is hard, sergeant, that we must lay idle with such a scene in view.” “Very hard, indeed, sir. If Aoko Shell were only here with his gun, something might be done even at this distance.” “Look there; is not the Merlin shifting her moorings?” “She is; she must have had a warm berth of it where she lay.” “And had she continued longer, Mauns, she might have been cooled in hte water.” The dark form of the vessel was now seen slowly moving down the river, and when she had arrived beyond the reach of the fort, the firing ceased for a brieinterval. “She is a cripple, sergeant, and walks as it were uponcrutches through the water.” “Rather like a red-neck, sir, with a broken wing,” replied Mauns. “But mark the course she is steering! Twenty yards farther and she will be upon the bar.” “They have bad pilots aboard for our waters, sergeant, that is clear. But why has the firing ceased? This calm is more awful than the rattling of artillery.” “True, sir; I must say I like the storm better, and wish they would finish the business without loss of time, since it must be settled.” Mauns had scarcely ceased speaking when the stillpess of the nighht was again broken by thhe deep-toned thunder of the cannon, which was succeeded by a sudden flash of light and a tremendous explosion, which agitated the river and shook the foundation of the fort on the Jersey shore. Every eye was turned towards the spot in fearful suspense, when, bursting through volumes of dense smoke, large flakes of fire betrayed that one of the vessels was enveloped in that consuming element. As the flames gained the ascendency, and were reflected in the water beneath, the light was so powerful that the movements of those on board could be distinctly seen. “What is the meaning of this, sir?” demanded Mauns. “The sloop is aground, and no doubt the crew have fired her,” replied Jurian. “Bad pilots, sergeant. They have not fished there as often as we have.” “I knew she must find the bar, unless she made short tack of it,” replied Mauns, and shouted “Victory! victory!” whle every voice in the garrison reechoed the joyful shout. All was bustle and confusion on board the hurning ship, and numbers threw themselves overboard and swam to the nearest vessel, while others let down the boats and leaping into them, rowed for life from the scene of destruction. The American gallies were seen moving to and fro in the blaze, and pouring a destructive fire upon thhe fugitive enemy. “Do but mark thhat boat, sir,” said Mauns, who watched with increasing interest the movements of the different craft, “I mean that one nearest the Merlin.” “I see the boat you mean; but why does that one in particular attract your notice?” “There's not a man on board, sir, who understands the use of the oar, or she would never move through the water in thhhat lazy fashion. Now, for my part I dislike to see men pretend to matters they do not understand, for they only expose themselves, Mr. Hartfield.” “And they have exposed themselves with a vengeance, for see, there goes a barge in pursuit of them.” “It serves them right—Pull away, boy! steady! There are some knowing ones, I warrant you, at the oars in that barge, for see how lightly she moves, as VOL. II.—6 though she were a creature bred in the water. Pull away! There, now, is a sight worth looking after.” “They gain upon her; the boat must be captured.” “It serves them right, sir; they should have stuck to the Merlin, for what have men to expect from a boat who do not know how to handle an oar?” The Merlin was scarcely cleared before similar bustle and confusion prevailed on board the Augusta man of war, which was also grounded at a short distance from the other. In a little while the deck was cleared, with the exception of four or five seamen, who were busily engaged before they abandoned her. The burning sloop sent forth so strong and steady a light, that the dancing waters shone like a sheet of liquid fire, and reflected every object that passed over their glittering surface. The cannonading had subsided, but still the British were annoyed by a discharge of musketry from the floating batteries. All the shipping, except the two alredy mentinoed, now withdrew with the utmost expedition, and when sufficient time had been allowed them to sail beyond danger, the few seamen who remained on board of the Augusta descended into a boat, and rowing down the river, soon disappeared in the obscurity of the night. The skill they displayed called forth the admiration of honest Mauns in as great a degree as the want of it in the former boat had his censure, and in after-life, whenever he attempted a description of the attack upon fort Mifflin, these two boats were sure to carry off the whole interest of his story. A dead calm now succeeded, which was only broken by the crackling of the spars and the roaring of the flames as they flaunted in the night breeze. The sailors had not forsaken the latter vessel long before a second explosion took place, and as the smoke dispersed the Augusta was discovered to be in flames, which ascended the rigging with the rapidity of lightning, to the top of the masts, and presented as imposing spectacle to the victors, who looked out in admiration from their galleys, stationed in different parts of the river. The British had retired to a distance, and many a proud spirit paced the deck that night with feelings of the bitterest mortification, and repeatedly paused to gaze at the consuming vessels, until they wer burnt to the water's edge. The following morning the melancholy office of burying the dead devolved upon the garrison at fort Mercer; and among others whom they consigned to the dust was colonel Donop, who led on to the assault the preceding evening: his wounds were beyond human aid, and he died shortly after he was taken prisoner, and was buried beyond the fort, where his tomb is still to be seen. “No useless coffin confin'd his breast, Nor in sheet nor in shroud they bound him, But he lay like a warrior taking his rest, With his martial cloak around him.” In the course of the day, Jurian and his companion left fort Mercer, crossed to the Pennsylvania shore, and pursued their course towards the main body of the army, under the command of Washington. The British commanders were not discouraged by the unfavourable result of these attempts, for such was the importance of opening the navigation of the Delaware, that they resolved to leave no means unassayed to accomplish it. Accordingly, the garrisons were almost daily annoyed, until the morning of the 15th of November, when the whole British fire was directed towards fort Mifflin, from their land batteies on Province island, and their shipping in the river. The small garrison of three hundred men sustained the shock with intrepidity for several hours, but towards the middle of the day, the works were battered down, and the ditches filled with their ruins; their situation now became critical, and officers and men expected their fate in the midst of carnage. Night put an end to the cannonading, but as the Americans perceived the English were taking measures for storming the body of the fortress the following morning, and being sensible that in the present state of things it was indefensible, they removed their military stores, fired the barracks, and crossed the river to Red Bank at twelve o'clock at night, and the next day the British took possession of the smoking ruins. It still remained to dislodge the soldiers of Congress from Red Bank, before the obstructions of the Delaware could be entirely removed. This operation was of absolute necessity; for although occasional vessels brought scanty supplies of provisions to Philadelphia, from the country about Chester, where the inhabitants were well affected towards the royal cause, yet the scarcity in the city became daily more distressing; and it was difficult to procure firewood on any terms. On the night of the 18th of November, lord Cornwallis marched with a considerable force, and the next day crossed the Delaware on his way to Red Bank. Upon the news of their approach, some continental generals were appointed to give colonel Green, who commanded the garrison, their opinion as to the expediency of waiting the attack. They favoured an evacuation, and wished that he would join them. He answered—“I shall follow your directions, either to evacuate or defend the fort. I know what we have done when the works were not half completed; and now they are finished, I am not afraid of the event.” But the direction was to evacuate, which was complied with, though with manifest reluctance; and the British shortly after dismantled the fort, and demolished all the works. The American shipping having now lost all protection, several of the galleys and other armed vessels took the advantage of a favourable night, kept close in with the Jersey shore, passed the batteries of Philadelphia, and escaped to places of security higher up the river. The enemy, on perceiving this transaction, took the precaution to prevent the escape of a considerable number, which being completely environed, were abandoned by their crews and fired. The British, having secured the command of the river, laboured to clear it of all the impediments with which the Americans had obstructed the channel. About the middle of December, after making a general forage on the western side of the Schuylkill, sir William Howe determined to retire to winter quarters at Philadelphia; and Washington, who had fruitlessly endeavoured to tempt him to an attack, while encamped on Chesnut Hill, felt the necessity of providing immediate winter quarters for his suffering, and almost disheartened troops. He accordingly commenced his march towards Valley Forge. The season was inclement, and the soldiers were so ill clothed, that some were seen to drop down dead with cold, while others, without shoes and stockings, had their feet cut by the frozen ground, and left their tracks in blood, from White Marsh to Valley Forge. After the most painful efforts, the troops reached their destined quarters on the 19th of December. This was the most critical period of the revolution. The American soldiers were worn down with fatigue and suffering,—without sufficient food, and nearly naked in the depth of winter;—disheartened by a campaign rather unsuccessful, and encouraged in their discontent by certain officers, who, envious of the commander-in-chief, in order to tarnish his glory and effect his removal, readily attributed to him all the privations the soldiery were doomed to undergo. The victories of the northern army were enlarged upon, and invidious comparisons were drawn between Gates and Washington, to the disadvantage of the latter. He was openly charged with incapacity, and these slanders were not confined to private individuals, but were repeated by men in office, and from the several state legislatures 6* resounded in the hall of Congress. The object of these machinations was to induce Washington to retire in disgust from the head of the army, and thus make room for the promotion of Gates to the exalted station. Pennsylvania was chagrined at the loss of her capital, and on the report that Washington was moving into winter quarters, the assembly addressed a remonstrance to Congress, severely censuring the measure, and plainly expressing their dissatisfaction at the mode in which the war had been conducted. Such was the state of public feeling, when Washington was struggling to keep the remnant of his exhausted army together, knowing that the liberties of the country depended upon the event. The soldiers were too ill clothed to admit of being exposed to the inclemency of that season, under mere tents; and when it was proposed that a sufficient number of huts should be built of logs and mortar, in which they would find more effectual shelter, some treated the idea as ridiculous, and few thought it practicable; they however immediately set about constructing their habitations, which were erected upon the plan of a regular city. All was in active motion; some cut down trees, while others fashioned them, and in a short time all the barracks were completed, and the soldiers comfortably lodged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. A worthy man is Stephano, but too much prone to talking. Old Play. Habit has been pronounced a second nature, and its influence over major M`Druid was truly remarkable. The State House clock seldom rung four, post meridian, without his starting from his seat, should he peradventure be sitting, and drawing from his fob a massy silver watch of curious workmanship, he would test the accuracy of the town timepiece. He would then pull his shirt collar above his black stock, and endeavour to brush up the nap on his foxy beaver, in order to give himself a more buckish appearance before he sallied forth, for the major had seen enough of the world to know that a fair outside will make even a counterfeit coin pass currently, while a genuine one, a little tarnished, is frequently rejected. But what was the reason of the major's propensity to walk at the hour of four? He had discovered that it was an ancient custom in 'squire Morton's family to set the wine circulating daily at that hour, and it has already been shown that the major was strict in his devotions to the fire-begotten, provided another furnished the libation: we do not mean to insinuate that this was the sole cause of his periodical visits; it would be improper in us so to do, for certain it is Miss Buckley attributed the frequency of his calls to a widely different motive, and she had an opportunity of forming a correct opinion on the subject; still it had its influence on the major, and doubtless would have led to the result mentioned, without the additional attraction. The major and the 'squire had fairly discussed the merits of a second bottle of the Anno Domini '65, when a servant informed the latter that the earl of Balcarras desired to see him in another apartment, and as he withdrew Miss Buckley entered to entertain the major. She seated herself upon the extremity of the sofa upon which M`Druid was anchored, and casting a fascinating look upon the soldier, began to open her battery. “It is astonishing to me, major, that a gentleman of your gallantry and address should have passed through life without having your heart perforated by the shafts of Cupid.” “By my hilts,” replied the major, “excuse the coarseness of my favourite expression; my heart has been a target for the blind god to shoot at from the age of fifteen to the present speaking, and I am of opinion, before he is done with his sport, he will leave it like a cullender.” “A just comparison, major, as they appear to possess equal powers of retaining what they receive.” “Smaller particles may escape, madam,” continued the major, “while all that is valuable is still retained. But there is no hole large enough to permit a lady to pass, I promise you.” “If so,” replied the spinster, “how is it that you have never ventured upon the connubial state? Ah! major, I fear you are a reprobate after all, and credit the cant abuse of matrimony.” She looked uncommonly fascinating as she concluded; that is to say, as much so as the nature of things would admit, for Cupid somehow loses his rosy smiles when dangled on the knee by father Time; still she looked archly, and the major recognised the signal, and sat more erect upon the sofa. His rosy face mantled with what was intended to be an engaging smile, but the spirit of wine was in him, and like most men who attempt to look remarkably sagacious while in that condition, by some strange mistake he moved the wrong muscles of his countenance, and appeared more like a simpleton than became a man of his age and distinction. “You do me injustice,” he replied, bowing. “I consider the marriage state the happiest that can be entered upon in the walks of civil life; but for a military man, Miss Buckley, that changes the whole complexion of affairs—a military man”— The major's words became thick and his ideas confused, and accordingly he forgot to conclude his sentence, for he did not belong to that numerous class who consider words the only essential part of conversation, and ventilator-like are kept in constant motion by the slightest puff of wind. Miss Buckley, however, was differently constituted, and thinking it but idle waste of time to wait until he could collect himself, she continued— “You are right, major; though we sometimes meet with a pair who wrangle like Xantippe and Zoroaster, yet, on the other hand, we are gratified by seeing numbers imitate the example of Plutarch and Laura, and Peter and Harriet.” The major drew his large hand slowly across his capacious forehead, in order to confine his wandering ideas within as small a compass as possible, and after a few moments of silence, he gave a deep hem, and said— “Peter and Harriet! Some of your neighbours, perhaps? Really, madam, I have not the pleasure of an acquaintance with the happy couple.” “Their melancholy fate,” replied the spinster, “is recorded in the Roman history, and remains a lasting example of female fortitude and constancy.” “In the Roman history,” replied M`Druid, “that was before my time; I however remember something about one Petus and Arria, which in truth is a very pretty story, and for any thing I know the modern historians may have changed the names of the parties in the translation.” “I think,” said the spinster, “that such an example of constancy should silence the sneers of the railers against matrimony.” “I think so, too,” replied the major. “And when we are told that Alexander the Great swam the Red Sea to visit a Hero—what are we to think then, major?” “Think—that he was a master in the art of swimming,” replied M`Druid, gravely. “Nothing else, major?” demanded the spinster, at the same time bestowing an expressive glance, by way of prompting an answer. “Yes, madam, I should pronounce John Mandeville a spalpeen in the art of lying, compared to the man who would venture to record such a fable for gospel.” “Then you don't credit it?” “By my hilts, madam, not until I see it, unless I am to understand that you vouch for its authenticity.” “O! major, major,” exclaimed the spinster, “I find you are a downright heretic after all. You may talk of your heart being a target for Cupid, but you know nothing of the power of love. You are the first of your sex that ever denied that Alexander the Great swam the Red Sea.” The conversation now turned upon the conduct of Jurian in avoiding the duel with Balcarras. The subject had been enlarged upon in the family circle, to the disadvantage of our hero, for the purpose of estranging the affections of Agatha, for it is one of the irreconcilable contradictions in the composition of woman, that while she recoils and sickens at the sight of human blood, she will despise and avoid the man who refuses to imbue his hands in it. Still the representations of the conduct of her lover had little effect upon the mind of Agatha, for she well knew that cowardice had not influenced the step he had taken. Her father declaimed in good set terms against him, and her aunt, in whose bosom chivalry and romance still smoked in the embers, was eloquent on the subject, and brought Richard Cœur de Lion, Peter the Hermit, and Don Quixotte, to bear her out in the assertion that he had forfeited all claim to female regard—notwithstanding which Agatha obstinately remained of a different way of thinking. It is remarkable how firm the most timid and undecided female will become on a subject of this nature. It is not uncommon to behold a delicate creature, as ethereal as if she were nourished by `the chameleon's dish;' so timid that she will tremble as the aspen leaf, if the wind but pipe hoarsely; sensitive as the mimosa that shrinks within itself, if the minutest insect in nature crawl upon it; one that would blush blood deep, should you presume to imagine that there was any thing corporeal between the ankle and the chin; and yet this delicate creature, so timid, so sensitive, so modest, speaking in the vernacular, when a man is in the case, possesses the surprising faculty of divesting herself of all the qualities just enumerated, and assuming their very opposites, as if nature knew not what she was about when she mingled the materials. And why is this? The fact is such, but as we have not leisure to analyze the subject, we must leave it to the ladies themselves to explain. We have said that Miss Buckley had changed the subject of conversation to Jurian's conduct. She had delivered her sentiments in the same strain for the twentieth time, to which M`Druid listened with all the drowsy patience of a judge who holds court after dinner during the summer term. After enumerating the countless objections to our hero, and descanting on his presumption in aspiring to the hand of her niece, she concluded— “Under such circumstances, major, there can be no fear of his entering one of the most respectable families of America. We have all set our faces against him, and my niece's pride will prevent her from frustrating our wishes. We know what is due to our station, and the man who marries Miss Morton must be like Cæsar's wife, major, take my word for it.” “Then, by the powers, he will not be the man for Miss Morton, take my word for that,” replied the major. The spinster affected to blush, and exclaimed— “Fie, fie major, what do you mean to insinuate?” “Nothing, madam,” replied M`Druid. “Nothing!” repeated the spinster, stealing a look that seemed to question his veracity. “Nothing, on the honour of a soldier,” responded the major, gravely. Miss Buckley's inquisitive look vanished, and she turned away evidently disappointed, for it is said, and perhaps truly, that there is nothing so trying to a lady's patience, as to excite her curiosity and refuse to gratify it. Much to the satisfaction of M`Druid, their conversation was interrupted at this critical juncture by the entrance of 'squire Morton, accompanied by major Andre and Balcarras, for the old major, notwithstanding his unlimited gallantry, was impatient to be relieved from the burden of a tête-a-tête, that he was not in a condition to sustain with spirit. It is among the greatest bores that society imposes upon its votaries, to be obliged to talk by the hour when you have exhausted all you have to say during the first five minutes, and feel that you are becoming excessively stupid while endeavouring to maintain your character of an agreeable fellow. Such were the feelings of the major during the foregoing; true, he struggled against them, but they had gained too great an ascendency to be thrown off at will—we can therefore account for his recovering his usual spirits upon the entrance of the company, for he felt like one reprieved on his way to execution. Extremes, it is said, are nearly allied, and the major's spirits were an evidence of the truth of the assertion. “Major,” exclaimed Andre, “we have a project on foot, and require your assistance to carry it through; and as it is for a charitable purpose we will take no refusal.” “Och! now, my jewel, at this present speaking I could not find it in my heart to refuse you any thing, charitable or otherwise; so name your project.” “By way of adding to the amusements of the winter,” continued Andre, “we propose getting up theatrical entertainments, in which the officers will sustain the principal parts. There is a good theatre in South street, Delancey and myself have some skill with the brush, and will decorate the stage. We are now beating up for recruits for our dramatic corps, and as soon as our numbers are filled we shall commence business.” “I am your man for the heavy line,” exclaimed M`Druid. “By my hilts, there is not a better in the whole army. But you spoke of charity; now, for the soul of me, I can see nothing like charity in all this, unless you mean that charity begins at home, and intend to pocket the proceeds accordingly, which would be following the example of stage-managers throughout the world.” “That is by no means our intention,” replied Andre. “The receipts shall be appropriated to the relief of the widows of our brave comrades who have fallen, and there are many of them, God knows, who need assistance, however small it may be.” “Your heart was ever in the right place, major,” VOL. II.—7 replied M`Druid, “and when the spark of charity is kindled to cheer the heart of the widow, never let it be said that M`Druid was the man to throw cold water upon it. On or off the stage, I shall ever be ready to play the fool at woman's bidding; so, major, I say, mark me for the heavy business, and if you have a better actor in your company, eggs are not eggs, for you'll find me no novice in the art, Mr. Manager.” “No novice! have you ever tried your wings, major?” “To be sure and I have, and a bold flight I made of it, my jewel. It was at Drogheda that I made my first appearance in the Ghost in Hamlet, and by the powers I played it to the life, that is to say, there was never seen such a lively ghost on the stage before or since. It was beautiful.” “This is the first I have heard of it,” replied Andre. “Read the chronicles of the day, sir, read the chronicles of the day, and you will find it somewhere recorded that Mr. Phelim M`Druid, having obtained merited applause by enacting in Terence's comedies at Father O'Flogagain's grammar school, despised hiding his candle under a bushel, and accordingly exhibited the full blaze of his talents upon the public stage to the amazement of a numerous audience.” “I am astonished at this confession, major,” said Miss Buckley, “for we are told that the condition of players among the Romans was infamous; true, it was more honourable among the Greeks, but when the poet Laberius was forced upon the stage by the tyranny of Cæsar—” “Faith, madam,” exclaimed M`Druid, “we have little to do with the ancients in the present day; they had their way of thinking and we have ours; and though perhaps we look upon players in the same light as the Romans did, yet we live among them, and treat them as did the Athenians; and as the business of life is to sustain life, to my mind it matters little how the end is attained, provided the means be not vicious. We are all merely players upon a mighty stage of which Providence is the manager, and he who struts the hero of the day should not affect to despise even the candle-snuffers of his company, for when the scene closes and the curtain falls, they must mingle promiscuously together.” “You were ever a radical, major,” replied Andre; “but, pray, tell us how did this frolic of yours terminate?” “Some said I was a great deal too fat and rosy for a ghost,” continued the major, “but, by my hilts, fat as I was, they came near to making a real ghost of me before the play was over.” “How so?” “Having made my face as pale and ghastly as a pound of meal could make it, I stalked on, truncheon in hand, and though I say it, was as kingly a looking ghost as you would see in a summer's day. When I turned my mealy face upon the audience, shouts of applause arose, and I of course made three graceful bows, after the latest fashion, to show that my breeding had not been neglected in that particular.” “It was quite in character,” replied Andre, “for you were playing the ghost of a king.” “I never lose sight of nature, no matter what character I assume,” replied M`Druid, gravely, “for propriety is the very soul of acting. Horatio and Marcellus seeing me so civil, were not quite as much alarmed as they ought to have been at my presence, especially as I had directed brimstone to be burnt behind the scenes to remind them of the place I came from. As soon as one of them exclaimed— `Stay; speak; I charge thee, speak;' I gave him a most kingly look of contempt, just by way of showing that he was too familiar, and turning short upon my heel, vanished in a twinkling, amidst a volume of smoke. It had a prodigious effect, I assure you.” “I dare say it had,” replied the other. “The torrents of applause had scarcely subsided,” continued the major, “when I re-entered upon the succeeding scene, in which you know I had nothing to do but stand still, and look at the players and audience until the cock crows. I was perfect in the play in all its parts, and as the actor who appeared as Horatio preferred his own language to the author's, no uncommon circumstance in the profession, instead of standing idle on the stage, I did double duty, that of prompter and ghost at the same time, and in order to show my parts I prompted as loud as Horatio roared and ranted. It was a fair trial between us, but the spalpeen stood no chance, for I had the audience all on my side, and they applauded my zeal mightily.” “I will venture to say they did.” “One bad player,” continued M`Druid, “is enough to destroy the effect of the whole piece, and so it proved in the present instance. The bogtrotter, stationed behind the scenes to play chanticleer, forgot to crow, and I became impatient to vanish, but you know could not conveniently do it without the summons. I waxed warm at this unpardonable neglect, and in order to show that I was perfect in the part, while the other players were going on with the dialogue, I hopped to the centre of the stage, clapped my arms against my sides two or three times, and then crowed as loud and beautifully as ever you heard from the throat of true game in the cock-pit; after which I vanished, as every true ghost is in duty bound, in a flame of blue fire and rosin.” “Really, I think it was time,” replied Andre, while Balcarras and the 'squire laughed heartily. “The thing was relished mightily, I assure you,” continued the major, “and when I appeared again they were all on tiptoe to hear me. I began— `I am thy father's spirit;' and by the thunders of applause, concluded I gave general satisfaction, until I came to the line— `But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air'— where I followed Hamlet's advice, and literally suited the action to the word, for I stalked about the stage, with my head raised, like a pig in a storm, snuffing the air from the four points of the compass. The whole house was delighted!” “That was certainly what the players call striking out a new reading,” observed Balcarras. “I thought so,” continued M`Druid, “and so I went on with even greater spirit, until the poor Ghost cries out— `O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!' I had no sooner delivered this line, than a tall Ulsterman, with a brogue as thick as my leg, stood up in the pit, and cried aloud— “By Saint Patrick, and you may say that with a safe conscience.” “Well, what effect had this?” “The laugh was rather against me for a time, but my friends made so much noise in applauding that they soon obtained silence, and I went on peaceably to the end of the speech, then making three polite bows to Hamlet, as became the ghost of a king, I concluded— `Adieu, adieu, adieu, remember me.' The tall Ulsterman stood up again, and cried—`Good bye to ye, and thank ye for going.' I shall never forget the rough brogue of the bogtrotter.” “Well, what ensued?” “A shower of rotten oranges and other filth from all parts of the house,” replied the major, gravely. “And you of course decamped?” “No, by my hilts, I withstood it like a soldier, until I found it too much for flesh and blood to bear, and then I stalked off and quietly gave up the Ghost—and thus ended my theatrical career.” 7* “You have mistaken your forte, major,” replied Andre, “and had better engage for the low comedy line, for if you were so successful in creating a laugh in a terrific part, in comedy you would certainly be irresistible.” “We shall not fall out about parts, Mr. Manager, though it has been the bone of contention among actors from time immemorial. Comedy or tragedy, it will be all one to Phelim M`Druid, for the player should make the part, and not the part the player. Still, you will find that I am your man for the heavy business.” “I am of opinion,” replied Balcarras, smiling, “that you will play the heavy business, no matter what walk of the drama you may attempt.” “Let me alone for giving them something substantial,” replied the major, who did not appear to understand the Scotchman's sarcasm. “They shall get none of your whip-sillabub from me, but a plain wholesome dish, where they may cut and come again.” Miss Buckley was of opinion that the major's representation of the Ghost was not true to nature, and that they did these things in a widely different style among the Romans and Athenians, but the major contended, that as few people were so fortunate as to have seen a ghost, and as they had discontinued their visits to this sphere entirely of late years, an actor was at liberty to exercise his own imagination in personating one, and no matter how fanciful his conception of the part, it would be absurd to pronounce it untrue to nature, as he was just as capable of judging of the nature of a ghost as his most sagacious critic. Miss Buckley now entered into a critical examination of the character of Hamlet, but as a whole library has already been written upon this subject, and no doubt, in the course of time another will be produced, we shall spare the reader the trouble of either perusing or passing over the remarks of our blue stocking, though they were as much to the purpose as most that has been said by her predecessors or followers. Major Andre succeeded in organizing his corps of Thespians, of which he and Delancey were the scene painters, and they decorated the stage with taste, but as their dramatic library was rather circumscribed, they were obliged to advertise in the tory press for copies of the popular dramas of the day. Eventually all difficulties were surmounted, and they figured away much to their own satisfaction and the edification of all loyal subjects in the good city of Penn, who felt charitably disposed towards the widows and orphans of those who had fallen in battle. The young officers were pronounced far more successful in the fictitious scenes, than in the eventful drama of real life which at that time engrossed their attention, but whether or not M`Druid performed the heavy business we have been unable to ascertain, after the most patient and laborious research. Neither have we been so fortunate as to meet with any record of the names of this corps, which could not fail to prove an interesting document in these days of antiquarian research, when it is deemed important to inform posterity who it was wore the first silk stockings, and who the last cocked hat in our favoured city. We were once introduced to an old lady who, it was said, was a reigning toast of the day, and present at all the entertainments, but on interrogating her, she protested that she was too young at the time to remember any thing of the matter, but as the old lady was married to her third husband a few days after, there was no difficulty in accounting for her absence of memory. Several other sources of information were applied to with similar success, when we relinquished the pursuit in despair, more fully convinced than ever that the path to useful knowledge is indeed a rugged and an arduous one. If such a matter as this required so much trouble to produce nothing at last, what must not the philosophical Bacon or the antiquarian Watson have encountered in opening their mines of learning to the world! While this pious attempt to cheat Satan at his own game, and travel to heaven as it were through his favourite hothouse, the stage, was in progress, the soldiers of the garrison were committing daily depredations on the inhabitants of the vicinity, and leaving the marks of fire and sword wherever they appeared. Neutrality and passiveness were no plea for protection. It was sufficient cause for savage brutality and wanton devastation, that the inoffensive victim resided on the soil that the invader came to pillage. The husbandman at midnight was dragged from his bed, his house plundered and fired, his cattle driven away, and his barn containing all his earthly store, reduced to ashes in the sight of his terrified and houseless family. This is no solitary picture, for the whole district was for years after dotted and disfigured with vestiges of this sort, that tended to kindle in the bosoms of their sons the animosity that the sufferers carried to their graves. And yet this was the policy adopted throughout, in order to reduce the colonies to subjection. They were to be scourged into bondage, without any regard being paid to their grievances, for the little aristocratic isle has ever been disposed to arrogate to itself a superiority over the rest of the world, and to view her colonies, whence she draws the nourishment that sustains her, in the light of plantations worked by slaves, and she will continue to do so until they have, one after another, taught her to consider them in the light of free and independent states. John Bull was ever a hard landlord, disposed to exact the whole product of the soil for rent, which if not paid on the day it became due, he would immediately distrain and bluster most terribly; now this is very bad policy on the part of master Bull, inasmuch as his title to most of his farms is exceedingly questionable, and his tenants may be driven by oppression to contest his right to exact any rent at all. We have been wandering; it is time to return.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. Attend to my discourse, and by the rules Of the duello I shall clearly prove He is a base bezonian, and beneath The notice of a cavalier who wears His cloak o' the court fashion. —The Sultan. Agatha entered the parlour just as her aunt finished her dissertation on the character of Hamlet, by which she lost exactly as much as you have, most courteous reader, by our omitting to transfer her remarks to our pages. This, we admit, was an inexcusable piece of neglect on our part, of which Miss Buckley with reason may complain, for by some unaccountable chance, on this occasion she spoke to the purpose, and as we have made her talk so widely of the mark throughout this veracious history, it is but justice that we should notice whenever she came near the thing she aimed at. But unfortunately it is the prevailing fault with historians to seize with avidity upon the most glaring features, which they ingeniously distort and exaggerate, while the more amiable but less striking traits are frequently passed over unnoticed, or if noticed, but slightly touched upon. A thousand minutiæ go to the formation of a character, without a knowledge of which it is impossible to be understood, and yet the historian will narrate a few of the most prominent events of a man's life, distort them that he may form his own corollary, and then leave the reader to decide upon the force of his logic. And such is history! As well might a painter daub an eye or a nose upon a piece of canvass, and palm it on you for a finished and striking likeness, in spite of your protest against the possibility of the man having no other feature than an eye or a nose in his countenance. But we are wandering again. On the appearance of Agatha the 'squire revived the subject of Jurian's conduct, which he discussed with more prejudice than justice, and Miss Buckley acted as junior counsel against the party arraigned. She gave her opinion at large, and touched upon as many subjects as a young advocate in making his maiden speech, which is usually a succinct history of the world from the days of Adam, and a little farther back. She spoke much and learnedly, for it is said to be cakes and ale to ladies of a certain, or rather an uncertain age, to sit in judgment upon character, and upon the slightest trail they will follow like a setter, knowing as little as he does the nature of the game pursued, and at times mistaking a stone for a bird. Still it is very pretty pastime, and your true sportsman never fails to bring down the object aimed at, though he should shoot as wide of the mark as Bob Acres himself, who is notorious for a long shot. Miss Buckley continued her declamation until she had nearly exhausted all the words to be found in Webster's new dictionary, and had began to coin others, most of which that able philologist has since introduced, when the 'squire's patience was wrought to the point of explosion, and he hinted at the propriety of postponing the balance until a future occasion. Agatha was quick to perceive the bearing of their remarks, and expostulated against the injustice of condemning a man unheard. She reminded them that the evidence produced was on one side only, that Jurian would doubtless furnish a different version of the story, and that common charity required them to suspend their opinion until such time as all the facts might be laid before them. “But do not actions speak more plainly than words?” demanded Balcarras. “They sometimes make a more lasting impression,” replied Agatha, smiling, “as you, my lord, no doubt can testify. But still they may be as equivocal as words.” “But not in the present instance,” replied Balcarras. “There is, unfortunately for the side you have espoused, not even a loop to hang a doubt upon. He has broken his faith, employed a base artifice to escape from confinement, and avoid giving honourable satisfaction to the man he had injured, and yet such conduct can find an advocate in one whose zeal almost makes me envy such a state of degradation.” Agatha blushed slightly at the compliment of the Scot, and replied— “Should your lordship ever attain the state you envy, I fear you would prize less highly the zeal of your advocate, for my ingenuity would avail but little before judges, who are disposed to decide contrary to the evidence of their own senses.” “Miss Morton surely cannot accuse me of such injustice?” “You have thus far been but a witness, my lord; I have heard your testimony, but not your decision, which I confess I am curious to learn.” “The circumstances of the case can lead but to one conclusion,” replied Balcarras. “And that is, my lord—” “That he avoided the meeting from cowardice, or if you consider the term too harsh, call it prudential motives.” “I fear,” replied Agatha, with an arch smile on her lips—“I fear all the evidence is not before the court, or we should have a different decision. I must therefore move in arrest of judgment, and proceed to cross examine the colonel.” Balcarras betrayed uneasiness, for he had more than once experienced the severity of her sarcasm. “What does the giddy girl mean?” demanded the 'squire. “Never bother yourself about the meaning, sir,” exclaimed M`Druid, whose eyes had been for some time fixed in admiration on the animated countenance of Agatha. “Only let her speak, and I care not if she talk in Hebrew.” “Exceedingly gallant, major, indeed,” replied Agatha. “Cato the censor could not have been more severe,” said the spinster. “By my hilts, you misunderstand what I would be at. There is, to my ear, so much music in woman's voice, that I would as soon think of finding fault with an Italian air because I could not comprehend the words of the song, as to criticise her meaning. There is no sound in nature half so sweet, and it may be termed the universal tongue, for it is understood throughout the world, no matter to what language the words may belong.” “Machiavel himself,” exclaimed the spinster, “could not have escaped from your dilemma more adroitly.” “Still, major, it appears that you care more for sound than sense?” continued Agatha, “and if that be the case, you doubtless hold a kettle-drum in higher esteem than a woman's voice, notwithstanding your pretended admiration.” “Would not the town-clock be a better comparison?” said Balcarras. “And why the town-clock, colonel?” “For it has the faculty of circulting information, without being sensible of what it publishes to the world.” He affected to smile, but instead of concealing, it only betrayed the bitterness of spirit in which the remark was made. “The days of sir Charles Grandison are over,” exclaimed Miss Buckley. “Diogenes in his tub was a courtier to him,” said M`Druid, “and, by my hilts, he does not deserve to stand in the sunshine of a woman's smile until he recants his libel.” “Still his comparison fails,” replied Agatha, “for the clock speaks but once in an hour, and where will you find a woman of that description?” “It fails in another respect,” replied Balcarras, forcing a smile, “the clock speaks seldom, but always to the purpose.” “The savage! a true descendant of the ancient Picts,” muttered Miss Buckley, and her veneration for the titled man fell fifty per cent. at least. “I will imitate the clock, colonel,” replied Agatha, and for once speak to the purpose; so come into court and let us proceed with your examination. Now, upon the affidavit you have made, you know of no reason why Jurian Hartfield should not be branded with the name of coward?” Balcarras hesitated, and the old 'squire said— “What means this trifling, you little puss?” “Trifling, sir? I was never more serious in all my life, and I expect a serious answer to my question.” “You have espoused a desperate cause,” replied the old man, “and as the weight of testimony is against you, you may as well abandon it in despair.” “No, sir, I contend that all the testimony has not yet been heard, and that it is contrary to every principle of justice to go on to trial in the absence of the defendant.” “That is certainly the law of the present day,” said the spinster, “though it was different among the Greeks and Romans.” “But will he return,” demanded Balcarras, “and refute the charges?” “If he does not,” replied Miss Buckley, “he will VOL. II.—8 forfeit his recognisance, and in that case you can proceed against the bail.” “Still you evade my question,” said Agatha to Balcarras. “Not intentionally, I assure you,” replied the earl, “for I know of nothing to alter the opinion created by his conduct in the present instance. “Since your memory is so treacherous, my lord, I must bring a dumb witness into court.” “A dumb witness!” “Ay, but one, as my good aunt would say, that will speak as eloquently without a tongue as Cicero or Demosthenes.” Saying which she hastily left the room. “There are certainly no orators of the present day to be compared to them,” said the spinster. “What can the little witch mean?” exclaimed her father. “By my hilts,” exclaimed M`Druid, “she is too deep for my line, but she speaks most musically, and that's sufficient for me.” “But I fear, Balcarras, not as much to the purpose as the town-clock,” said the 'squire, jocularly. “She has long been preparing to strike,” replied the earl, forcing a smile, which only betrayed that he was not as much at ease as he wished to appear. “And, zounds, she has armed herself for the blow,” exclaimed the squire, “for here comes the jade with her dumb witness.” Agatha entered, as he spoke, with a drawn sword in her hand, and Balcarras with difficulty concealed his confusion as she approached him, and said— “This, I believe, is your sword, my lord, as your name is on the hilt. I need not remind you how you lost it nor where it was found, but pray wear it for my sake, and if it does not eventually work a change in your opinion of Jurian, henceforth I discard all faith in magic charms and spells.” “Zounds, child, is the sword bewitched?” exclaimed the 'squire. “I believe it was, sir, on one occasion. What say you, colonel?” replied Agatha, with provoking archness. He stammered a reply, which was happily interrupted by Miss Buckley. “Orlando, we are told, fought with an enchanted sword, but we do not meet with any thing of the kind in modern times.” “But your dumb witness,” said the 'squire, “which was to speak as eloquently as Cicero, says nothing after all. When, pray, is it to begin?” “You are mistaken, sir,” replied Agatha, laughing. “It has already held a long colloquy with the colonel; true, it was carried on in a whisper, but my ears were quick enough to overhear it.” “How delightfully she prattles,” exclaimed M`Druid, who was lounging on the sofa, his jovial face enlightened with benevolence, “there is more music in her tongue, than in the harp of old Carolan the bard.” It is strange how widely men will differ in their opinions, for Balcarras thought that the voice of Xantippe, when strained to the highest pitch, must have been the very soul of melody, compared to the discord that proceeded from the pretty lips of Agatha. “Come, child, give us the substance of this dialogue, “exclaimed the 'squire, “for we must have no whispering in company.” “It said, colonel,” continued Agatha, “that a woman can never keep a secret, so you must pardon me if I afford another instance of the truth of the adage.” Balcarras bowed haughtily, and Agatha continued— “Having the colonel's consent, I need not hesitate. Then, sir, in the first place the sword saluted the colonel, and said, `I am very happy in being restored to you, sir, for I thought we were parted forever.' To which the colonel replied, `I was in hopes never to have seen you again, for I have no faith in you. You could not possibly have timed your visit worse, and instead of being here, I wish you were at the bottom of Darby creek, with all my heart.”' “You have sharp ears, indeed, girl, if you have heard all that,” said the 'squire. “Rather a fruitful imagination, sir, than quickness of hearing,” responded Balcarras, whose ever-ready smile but ill concealed his rising indignation. “Fact, my lord, fact,” exclaimed Agatha, “every syllable, besides much more that I heard as distinctly.” “Let us have the balance, by all means,” said M`Druid. “The sword then demanded of the colonel whether he was a brave man,” continued Agatha, “to which he replied, with some temper, `who dare question it?' `Not I,' says the sword, `but for a brave man, methinks you have suffered an old and trusty friend to be treated rather cavalierly by one whom you pronounced a coward.”' The confusion of Balcarras became more apparent, for he found himself in that awkward situation in which common courtesy required him to affect good humour, while his blood boiled with indignation. As well might you command a lobster to keep cool while his shell is turning `from black to red.' “Well, niece, how did this singular dialogue terminate?” demanded Miss Buckley, who perceiving the uneasiness of Balcarras, notwithstanding the cloak he had thrown over his feelings, thought it a favourable opportunity to be revenged on him for the sarcasm he had cast upon the sex. Since knight errants have disappeared, the greatest stickler for the supremacy of woman is your virgin of sixty-five. Agatha continued— “The sword, dear aunt, replied in your own language, and reminded the colonel that Octavius Cæsar acquired more honour for having conquered Brutus, than from any action of his after life.” “The sword speaks in parables; I do not understand the reply,” said the spinster. “It is sufficient that the colonel does,” replied Agatha. “Octavius was considered a weak man, and Brutus himself pronounced him such, but after the battle of Phillippi, Brutus was silenced and his laurels were transferred to the brow of Cæsar.” “Brutus and Cæsar!” exclaimed the 'squire, “this, Becky, is all your doings; I shall have another pedant in petticoats, and curse me if I shall understand a word that is spoken under my roof. What do you mean, you little playful fawn you, what do you mean?” “I must leave his lordship to explain,” replied Agatha, smiling, and left the room. She had sustained the foregoing conversation with a degree of archness and levity that ill accorded with her feelings, for notwithstanding the constant succession of amusements that the gallantry of the officers afforded, and the novelty of the scene to our heroine, it was impossible for her to disengage her mind from a sense of the danger in which the companion of her childhood was involved. It lay like a poisonous mineral at the very fountain of thought, and corrupted the whole stream. The delicate hue of her cheeks had faded away, and her bright eyes no longer sparkled with their wonted animation. Still she was calm. There was no outward display of grief, but notwithstanding her struggle to appear as cheerful as ever, it was impossible to deceive her anxious and doating father. He perceived that both her mind and frame had undergone a fearful change, and knowing that the most delicate and beautiful of Nature's works fade soonest, as if the portion of heavenly essence with which they are endued disqualified them for a prolonged existence in this world, he experienced all the solicitude of a father whose only hope is suspended by a spider's web, and who is alarmed at every breath of air that may agitate the fragile strand. Still Agatha at times recovered her natural spirits, 8* and her voice would break forth as joyously as the notes of the blue-bird when he heralds the approach of spring; the well known sound was as a medicine to the heart of her father, and she in her filial piety intended it as such, but like the notes of a bird in the wilderness, it cheered the solitude for a moment, but when it died away, the gloom again prevailed unchanged. The unrestrained intimacy of Balcarras in Mr. Morton's family had tended to increase the ardour of his passion for Agatha, which was heightened as he became more fully persuaded of its utter hopelessness. Love, though pictured as a weak and timid child, glories in the rocking of the storm, and gathers vigour while encountering difficulties. Balcarras was not aware of the extent of his passion until Agatha's preference for another, and the apparent improbability of estranging her feelings, became too manifest to be questioned. He trusted that the disgrace that had attached itself to the character of Jurian would operate in his own favour, but in this he was disappointed, for so far from weakening it appeared to strengthen her devotion, and every argument that he adduced to detract from the reputation of his rival, recoiled upon himself, until he was finally discomfited with his own weapons. The railery of Agatha was keenly felt. His proud spirit was mortified at being exposed to ridicule before his companions, and his chagrin was increased at the idea of having established his rival's character for bravery by the very means by which he had hoped to prove him a coward. It is no easy task to turn a stream from its original channel, and when a man's thoughts have been directed for months together towards one object, it is not a slight obstruction that will change their course, but like the brook it appears as if obstacles only tended to increase the force of the current. It was a part of the creed of Balcarras, that no simple girl in the colonies would be able to withstand a gallant of his address, with a ribbon in his button-hole, and a title to his name, which proved conclusively that he had a grandfather before him, but the earl had now begun to question the correctness of this belief, though he could not comprehend the reason of things being ordered so differently in the new world from what they are in the old. He ultimately, however, placed it to the score of ignorance, and deplored the state of society that refused to pay him the homage to which he considered himself entitled by prescriptive right. The homely proverb, that `every tub must stand on its own bottom,' he conceived was fraught with rank injustice, as it deprived him of an unquestionable part of his birthright, the respect and admiration of the world, and he had been startled some time before at this singular departure from established principles, by the remark of a rough Virginia captain who had been taken prisoner at Germantown. Several of the scions of nobility were cutting their swells in the presence of our honest Virginian, and the earl contended that the public consideration to which a nobleman's progenitors were entitled, was an indefeasible part of the inheritance of the representative of the family honours, and no matter how weak or rotten the scion might be, his influence was not to be affected, provided the parent stock was a good one. Our Virginian replied—“We hold a different doctrine here. When weeds and nettles spring from the root of the prostrate oak, we treat them as weeds and nettles. Among us every man must hoe his own row, and he must do it well too, or he will get devilish little corn, I promise you. He need not expect a second crop, because his father happened to hoe it before him.” Balcarras, on leaving Mr. Morton's house, determined that Agatha should constitute a part of his travelling equipage, in spite of the many obstacles that presented themselves. His pride had been excited by her sarcasm, and his passion inflamed by the difficulties he had to encounter. But by what means could he accomplish his desires! It was evident that she would never reciprocate his love as long as Jurian was able to maintain his present position. He had attempted to hurl him down, and had suffered a mortifying defeat; still there were other means untried, from which a miracle alone could save the young man. He had sold himself to the enemies of his country, and if this fact were made known, he would be obliged to fly the land of his birth, or undergo an ignominious death, in either case the field would be left open to our magnanimous earl. The plot is a good plot, thought Balcarras, but who is there to put it in execution? He was not long in casting about to find a suitable instrument, for he had no sooner resolved upon the step than Paul Gordon entered his lodgings to inquire for young Morton. The subject was proposed, and a well filled purse was produced to settle any abstract points that might arise in the mind of honest Paul, but none presented themselves, for the earl was not more anxious for the removal of Jurian than was Gordon himself, as he hoped such a result might advance his views with Miriam. He accordingly pocketed the purse, which he considered being handsomely paid for doing his own business, and assured the earl, with an oath, that `he would blow the young rebel out of water before he was many days older.' Paul always swore roundly when he wished to be emphatic, and to impress his hearers with a due sense of his importance. Preliminaries being settled, our hero of the stirrup cocked his hat upon his head in a manner that showed that he was on very good terms with himself, and stalked out of the room perfectly satisfied with the unexpected result of his visit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. — All the works Are blown in fumo, every glass is burst, Furnace and all rent down! as if a bolt Of thunder had been driven through the house. Retorts, receivers, pelicans, bolt-heads All struck in shivers! —The Alchemist. The American forces had not been long established in their winter quarters at Valley Forge, when famine appeared among them, and nearly occasioned the entire dissolution of the army. In the depth of an unusually inclement winter, surrounded by a waste of snow, poorly sheltered from the elements, insufficiently clad, and worse fed, it is not to be wondered at that discontent prevailed, from officers of high grade down to the meanest subaltern. To add to their sufferings, sickness had made greater ravages in their ranks than the sword of the enemy. Their hospitals were filled with the dead and the dying, and those who were required to perform duty, moved like shadows through the garrison, disease upon their cheeks, and their emaciated bodies shivering as though every blast of wind would congeal the nearly exhausted fountain of life, and as they turned their eyes from the sickening scene, they beheld little to revive and console the drooping spirit, for nature herself was in a state of desolation. A succession of reverses had rendered almost hopeless the cause in which they had embarked their fortunes, and among the master spirits there were to be found those, whose minds, fired by ambition and embittered by envy, instead of endeavouring to allay the prevailing discontent, they promoted it to the extent of their power, and thus committed a suicidal act upon their fair fame. It has been stated that the encampment was built upon the plan of a regular city, and that the huts were constructed with logs, the interstices between which were filled with clay and mortar. Captain Swain and his friend M`Crea were quartered together, and in the rear of the cabin the surgeon had erected another, which he fitted up as a laboratory, where he made his philosophical experiments towards the discovery of the arcanum of prolonging human life, though hourly called upon to visit death's doings. This cabin was strewed with crucibles, retorts, receivers, and curiously constructed air-pumps, which he had the temerity to experiment upon himself, when at a loss for a patient possessed of a greater share of courage and credulity than common sense. Countless were the decoctions that he tasted, various were the powders that he formed from the whole pharmacopœia of nature, and he withstood the discharge of his electrical battery like a true hero, until his frame had wasted away to such a degree that he bore a more striking resemblance to the anatomy suspended in the case behind the door of his cabin than to a being of this world. Truly has it been said that the hill of science is hard to climb. It was the wonder of all how he managed to sustain life in a place where death was daily revelling, and the miracle was only to be accounted for by presuming that the King of Terrors, as he took his rounds, seeing him so often beside the sick bed of a victim, mistook him for one of his own disciples labouring in his vocation, and accordingly passed him by without throwing his unerring dart. A council had been called by the commander-in-chief in order to adopt measures for the immediate relief of the famishing army. Captain Swain, as he returned from head-quarters, where he had been to learn the decision of the council, was met by Jurian on a similar errand. “What have you learnt, sir; what is the result of their deliberations?” demanded Jurian. “It is said that general Howe has sent a strong detachment to forage in the islands of the Delaware, and the neighbourhood of Chester and Darby,” replied the captain. “And of course a detachment must be sent in that direction to prevent it,” replied the other. “Well, thank Providence, I am in health and ready for the expedition.” “So it was at first determined, but your patriotism will not be put to the test in that way,” said the captain. “How so?” “Because we are on the verge of starvation, and instead of cutting off the supplies of the enemy, it is necessary that our own magazines be first replenished, for on examination it appears that they do not contain a single day's provisions.” “Great heavens! this will increase the discontent which already prevails to a fearful extent throughout the garrison.” “I dread the consequences,” replied captain Swain, “for unfortunately we have those among us who care not what injury they do the cause, provided they can blemish the name of Washington, and such are already busy among the suffering soldiery.” “What measures have been adopted in this emergency?” “Foraging parties are to be despatched forthwith to seize provisions to satisfy the present wants of the army.” “The measure is a harsh one, and cannot fail to be unpopular.” “True; but the exigencies of our situation compel us to this step, and it is far better to commit this apparent injustice, than to suffer the army to be dissolved, upon which depends the emancipation of our country.” As they moved along the narrow alley between the huts, the doors of many of which were thrown open to admit the feeble rays of the sun, their hearts sickened as they heard the complaints of the half clothed and emaciated inmates. The murmurs were loud, nor was there any disposition to conceal the general discontent that prevailed. Those who were sick offered up their prayers for health, that they might quit the scene of famine, while those who enjoyed comparative strength threatened not to await the expiration of their term of service, fearful of being speedily reduced to the condition of their comrades. In the midst of these expressions of discontent, a gaunt figure, seated at the door of one of the cabins, was labouring hard to discipline a most unharmonious voice to the movements of one of those fine old continental airs, the effects of which are only surpassed by the fabulous account of the influence of the songs of the Thracian poet. True, they did not make trees and rocks join in the mystic mazes of the dance, but then they infused a new spirit into the bosom of the most insensible, and awakened feelings that otherwise might have slumbered through life. Our vocalist began in a voice that might have been heard half over the camp, for he evidently despised those delicate touches that throw the soul of a modern amateur into ecstasies. “Come all ye brave Americans whom liberty inspires, Whose hearts are warm with all the zeal our country's cause requires, Let not defeat dishearten you, but now your metal show, And join our gallant Washington against the haughty foe.” “No meat, no soldier, is my maxim,” exclaimed corporal Drone, who was shivering in the hut, with no other covering than his tattered rifle shirt, “and you may preach patriotism until you are hoarse, but you will be bothered, I am thinking, to keep even an army of shadows together without food.” The singer continued, without making any reply, or even noticing the interruption— “Although upon Long Island, the foe a victory won, Although fort Constitution fell, fort Lee and Washington; Remember they at Brunswick, boys, and Princeton felt the blow; Our troops were not discouraged there, but bravely fought the foe.” “Now where's the use, sergeant Talman, in bragging of our victories?” continued the corporal. “Hang me if I would give an Indian blanket, at this present speaking, for the honour of the whole of them.” The sergeant was too intent upon his song to be diverted from it by the remarks of the corporal. “The third of January, boys, the morning being clear, Our troops attacked the regulars near Princeton we do hear. Within a mile of Princeton, boys, the battle it begun, And many a haughty Briton fell before the fight was done.” “A better fate than to live and be famished in such a garrison as this,” muttered the corporal. Honest Mauns did not even turn his head towards the malcontent, but continued— “Th' invaders were dispersed, in fright they ran away; They ran across the country, boys, like sheep in great dismay; Loud crying out, `O! hide us, O! hide us, hide us do, For the rebels they'll devour us, so hotly they pursue.' “Then let us not despair, though we march to meet our graves, Since we can die as freemen, we'll never live as slaves; And should kind heaven protect us, and victory crown the day, We'll cheer our fallen heroes with many a loud huzza!” “Your huzza will be rather a feeble one, unless you get something to eat speedily,” replied the corporal; VOL. II.—9 but Mauns proved that his lungs were still in good condition, by shouting— “Huzza! huzza! We'll cheer our fallen heroes with many a loud huzza!”[2] [2] I have taken a few liberties with this song, which was a popular one during the Revolution. I am ignorant of the author's name, and know not whether the song itself is to be found in print, as I received it from the lips of an old gentleman who has treasured it in his memory from childhood, and sings it every fourth of July in the good old style of honest Talman. “There is one of the true descendants of Sven's army,” said captain Swain, pointing at Talman. As he finished his song, a soldier approached the cabin, without stockings on, and little other covering than a blanket thrown over his soldiers. “Here comes one, let us see whether you can get him to join in your huzzaing,” said the corporal. “That he will,” replied Mauns, “as long as his voice holds out, and when that fails, he will wave his hand as a token that his heart is in the right place.” “I wish I had a token that my bowels were in the right place,” replied the corporal, “for by their growling I should conclude they could not be in a worse one than they are at present.” “Your mouth is never silent but when it is filled,” said the captain, approaching. “It is very hard, captain,” replied Drone, “after all my services at Brandywine, Paoli, and at Germantown, to find that I am not a crust of bread the better. I am willing to fight for my country, but curse me if I can starve for it.” “Is your condition worse than that of many thousands?” “No sir, nor can I discover that my burden is the lighter for their sharing in it. I came to fight with the foe, and not with famine.” “Famine drove you to the camp, corporal,” replied the captain, “and we shall be the gainer if she hunts you from it again;” then turning to the new comer, he demanded what he wanted. “I have been ordered on duty, sir, and having no coat, have come to borrow the sergeant's.” Mauns stripped off his coat in silence, and handing it to the soldier, received his blanket in return, which he wrapped round his gaunt figure, and resumed his seat. “You are a stout fellow,” said the captain, “and I am glad to see that you keep up your spirits.” “How the devil he manages it,” muttered the corporal, “is a mystery to me, for we have not had a drop of rum since Friday.” “Silence, thou eternal raven,” cried the captain. “Nor bread for three days,” continued the corporal, “and that was as dry and mouldy as the bones of my grandfather.” “I wish the crust had been hard enough to choke you,” replied Mauns. “Nor meat since yesterday morning,” continued the pertinacious corporal. “Our commissaries must think that we have the stomachs of Nebuchadnezzar, and can subsist on hay, for we are in a fair way to give the experiment a trial before the grass grows.” “Thou mutinous rascal, stop thy clamorous throat, or I shall do it for you,” cried the captain. “I wish you would, provided you do it with a piece of bread and beef,” responded Drone. The captain turned to the sentinel, who stood listening in silence— “You hear this discontented fellow, who no doubt has come among us because he could not subsist elsewhere. There are, I fear, too many of the same description in the camp, but do not suffer their complaints to poison your mind, my brave fellow. True, this is a trying hour, but all will be well in a few days; only keep up your courage.” “Yesterday, at noon, sir, I stood sentinel at head quarters,” replied the soldier. “And what did you see there?” “The general at his dinner. The meat was as coarse as that in my own cabin, and yet he ate it with appetite, and returned thanks when he was done. I have thought of it ever since, and damn me if I desert him as long as there is as much as a corporal's guard remaining.” The soldier withdrew, and the corporal continued muttering, until sergeant Talman rose from his seat, and without opening his lips, deliberately took him by the collar, and leading him to the door of the hut, shoved him out of it, and then resumed his seat as composedly as if nothing had occurred. Drone retired muttering sedition, until he came to a hut in which several malcontents were assembled, which he entered, and added fuel to the fire that every hour threatened to burst out with irrepressible fury. Sergeant Talman was possessed of astonishing equanimity of temper; he was seldom disconcerted, and he would occasionally remark that a man can always attend to business with greater coolness and comfort to himself when he is not in a passion, and for his part he could never discover the advantage in getting out of humour. True, there is a tradition that on one occasion he swore a tremendous Swedish oath, but what the oath was no one remembers, and few understood it at the time, but all agree that the sergeant's temper was somewhat ruffled. The occasion was briefly this: he had a favourite pipe, with a curiously fashioned meerschaum bowl, as big as a tea-cup, which had descended to him from his great grandfather, who smoked it throughout the memorable siege of fort Casimer, and Mauns set great store by it on this account. Jurian, who, when a youngster, was fond of playing his pranks upon the honest Swede, who took the roughest in good part, for he loved the boy, one day got possession of this relic of antiquity, while Mauns was taking an afternoon nap, and filled the bowl with gunpowder. Mauns was prone to gossip at the village inn with Aoki Shell, at that period celebrated for his long shot on the Schuylkill, and no sooner did he awake, than taking his pipe, he repaired to the inn to hear the news, and become as philosophical as the fumes of the `devil's weed' could make him. A good story was broached, to which Mauns listened with deep interest, and being a man of few words, he usually called in the aid of his pipe to supply an occasional hiatus in the conversation, and substituted smoke for wind. It is no uncommon occurrence to see two Dutchmen converse for hours together by means of their pipes alone, and what is more astonishing, provided they are good smokers, they may rise quite as much edified as if their tongues had been running like mill clappers the whole time. Mauns never relished a long story so much as when he had a meerschaum in his mouth; accordingly Aoki, who was a very Arab in the way of fiction, no sooner commenced, than our worthy began to fix his pipe, and called for a coal of fire, aware that Aoki's story was entitled to a patient hearing, and thus prepared he could have set out the Arabian Nights without interruption, other than that which might be occasioned by knocking the ashes from his pipe, and replenishing it with tobacco. The fire being brought, and Talman having leisurely examined his pipe, and finding it well filled with mundungus, lighted it, and took his seat in silence among the company assembled beneath the shade of the old elm tree in front of the inn, and it must be confessed he was the most philosophical looking character present. Jurian was also a looker on, and vastly did he admire the gravity of the Swede, which increased in proportion to the interest of Aoki's story, and the density of the cloud that encircled the brow of the smoker. Aoki now began to probe the marrow of his narrative, 9* and while all were listening with intense curiosity, the interest that honest Mauns felt was indicated alone by two or three vigorous inspirations through his friendly tube. Jurian, leaning against the tree, kept his eyes fixed upon the interminable smoker, in anxious expectation of the explosion. Aoki continued, and Mauns smoked more vigorously than before, while the boy chuckled to himself, `a whiff more like the last will do the business.' The story drew towards a close, and Mauns smoked harder and harder, and the boy laughed outright at his earnestness, when lo! just as Aoki arrived at the climax of his tale, his last words were lost in the alarming explosion. Mauns bolted upright, and stood aghast, and it is said to have been the only time that he was ever frightened, or stood erect in his life, but no sooner did he behold the damage done to his meerschaum, that had withstood the racket of the Dutch war, than he ripped out the terrible oath already referred to, and which is said to have been the same that his great grandfather muttered betwixt his teeth when the fort of the Holy Trinity was surrendered. It had descended as an heir loom with the pipe to Mauns, and was only used by him on momentous occasions, but is said never to have passed his lips after the destruction of his family relic. “Is that all?” methinks I hear the reader exclaim. Not quite. The boy repaired the honest Swede's loss with a pipe of tenfold value, but as there was no traditionary history attached to it, it required all his philosophy to reconcile him to the exchange, and he discontinued smoking from that day. “But wherein lies the moral?” True, what is a story in the present age without a moral, when all that is written and all that is done must tend to the amelioration of mankind? Thrice happy and disinterested age, in which every man labours to improve the moral condition of his neighbour, without feeling the slightest concern for his own. Would not the work of reform be more effectually promoted if these philanthropists would begin with themselves, and among the various institutions for the suppression of vice and immorality, establish one that might tend to diminish pride, ambition, hypocrisy, and cant? But to return to the moral of this episode. It goes to show that boys were fond of crackers as far back as the middle of the last century, and that they may not place them in a tobacco pipe without doing a mischief; a lesson that the mischievous rogues should bear in mind when celebrating the fourth of July. “Hang such a moral!” Nay, sir, the lesson is calculated to do much good if properly taken, and though there is not as much point in it as we find in those admirable productions issued by the various tract societies, still the subject might be enlarged upon, and the irreverence of pinning crackers to the skirts of our sober and staid citizens illustrated, and in that case who would be bold enough to take an exception, since there is many an orthodox sermon wider from the purpose? “Pshaw! get on with your story,” exclaims the critic. “This digression destroys the unity of your design, and if tried by the rules of Aristotle—” Patience, most learned sir; I will get into the right track again, and carry you as expeditiously to the place of destination, as though you were on board a locomoter or a steamer. After sergeant Talman had ejected the corporal, captain Swain and Jurian continued their way to their own quarters, and the sergeant resumed his song. As they moved along the line of huts, complaints saluted them at almost every step, and numerous were the sickly and nearly naked beings that crossed their path. When they reached their hut, they found that M`Crea had retired to his laboratory, where indeed he passed the greater portion of his time in making his philosophical experiments. The discovery of the secret of prolonging animal life now engrossed his studies, for he deemed it unnecessary to trouble himself about his theory of gravity, as short rations had made more rapid strides towards its consummation than all his scientific researches; and he wisely concluded, that under existing circumstances it would require all his art to keep body and soul together. Jurian, since his return to the American army, had acquainted his benefactor with the necessity of rendering him pecuniary assistance, but pride induced him to withhold the knowledge of his degradation. Nor did the benevolent old man press the point; it was sufficient for him to know that his favourite required his aid, and he pledged himself to render it, though in consequence of the state of the times, the task was not an easy one to accomplish. Still this assurance did not relieve the mind of Jurian. He did not question that all he asked would be granted, but there was an isolated thought that seared his very soul; it clung to him with the tenacity of fire; sleeping and waking it burnt on alike, and there was little prospect of its progress being arrested until it had consumed the fountain of life itself. Captain Swain and our hero had been but a few minutes seated in their quarters, and the worthy descendant of the lord of Passaiung had scarcely commenced one of his favourite reminiscences of Swedish history, when he was interrupted by a violent explosion that proceeded from the rear of the cabin. “Heavens above us! what noise is that?” exclaimed the captain. “It comes from M`Crea's laboratory,” cried the other, and hastened around the hut to ascertain the cause. His apprehensions were realized, for volumes of dense and offensive smoke were issuing from the mouth of the laboratory of the infatuated chemist. Jurian rushed in, and lying among the air-pumps and crucibles upon the earth he found the unfortunate surgeon, and carried him into the open air, where he made rather a ludicrous appearance, his foxy wig being singed all over, and his face bearing the complexion of that of a coal-heaver, who like the miserable Kehama had been denied the advantages of water. A crowd of soldiers was soon attracted to the spot by the report made by the explosion; among whom was a young surgeon, who, seeing the situation of the chemist, opened a vein, and he shortly after came to his senses, when the first object that presented itself to his view was the stream of blood flowing from his arm. He looked wildly around him, while indignation was fast kindling in his eye. “What idiot has done this?” he cried, with a contemptuous sneer. “I did it, with the hope of relieving you,” said the young surgeon. “Of murdering me, you mean,” cried the enraged chemist, “or how came you to think of letting blood in such a case as this?” “Really, sir, it is the daily and regular practice in the service,” replied the other. “And so, provided I am killed by rule, you conclude I have no reason to complain.” “Killed, sir! you are now perfectly recovered, and I apprehend—” “You apprehend!” ejaculated M`Crea, eyeing the young operator with utter contempt; “and who the devil gave you a right to form an opinion of matters that the accumulated wisdom of ages has not yet mastered. We have come to a pretty pass, indeed, when geese cackle of science before their backs are freed from the egg-shell, and children in bibs and tuckers boldly advance their opinions.” “If I have erred, sir, all was done for the best,” replied the young surgeon. “And so you might have said had you killed me. But what satisfaction is it to me to know that you inflict the greatest injury with the best intentions?” Then turning to captain Swain and Jurian, who supported him, he desired to be conducted to his quarters. As he was hobbling off, assisted by his friends, he paused, and looking back upon the unlucky operator said, “Young man, I bear you no malice, but freely forgive you this act of thoughtlessness, which has shortened my life at least fifty years.” The group of soldiers stared at each other in astonishment, and considered the chemist mad. “I perceive that the days of the patriarchs have not yet been stricken from your calendar,” replied Jurian. M`Crea glanced his eyes upon him; there was something like a horrid grin upon his countenance, which might have been intended for a benevolent smile, but was spoilt in the making by the effect of his burnt wig, and the smoke which begrimed his wrinkled face from the chin to the forehead. A bucket of water was brought into the hut, and the woful countenance of M`Crea was in some measure restored to its original complexion, but he remained silent and evidently chagrined at the unfortunate termination of his experiment. Captain Swain shook the crisped locks from the wig, which now bore some resemblance to the back of a sheep too closely shorn, and replaced it upon the bald head of the surgeon, who witnessed the operation in silence and with a rueful countenance. “You appear dejected,” said Jurian; “I trust you have not been seriously injured by the accident?” “More so than an ordinary observer would imagine,” replied M`Crea, gravely. “In what part are you wounded? I see no external marks of injury.” “In my reputation:—I had accomplished the labour of my life—I should have satisfied an incredulous world of the truth of my theory, and have lived forever.” “That is rather a longer period than any man need bargain for,” replied Jurian; “so you may bless your stars that the accident has made you a mortal again.” “My life might have been limited, but my fame would have lasted to the end of time,” said the chemist, without raising his eyes. “I had consummated the study of my life; I had brought to a focus the rays of human knowledge: but the heat was too intense, and—” the chemist paused— “It all ended in smoke,” added the captain. “There was but one grain more of azote to have been infused into the crucible,” continued the chemist, “and the elixir would have been perfected, and my name descended to after ages with those of Kelly and Dee.” “I don't know as to that,” observed the captain, drily, “but it was near being the means of your paying those worthies a visit rather unexpectedly.” “Captain Swain, Horace tells us, `magna movet stomacho fastidia,' and my stomach already revolts at thy miserable attempts at humour. Jam desine, jam desine.” Then turning to Jurian, he said, “Prithee, boy, go into my laboratory, and fetch the crucible I had upon the furnace.” “Impossible, sir! It has been fractured into at least a thousand pieces.” “Each of which is worth its weight in gold,” continued the chemist. “It cannot be otherwise, for transmutation must have taken place before the unfortunate explosion.” “Perhaps so; but a very expeditious change from gold to crockery ware must also have succeeded, if this is a part of the crucible,” replied Jurian, picking from the floor of the hut a piece of the pot, which having lodged in M`Crea's apparel, had been carried into the hut. The chemist seized it eagerly, and after examining it closely, said— “Oh! the blindness of ignorance, and the vanity of all human projects. One instant longer, and I should have made the greatest discovery the sun ever shone upon, and now this little piece of earth is all that remains, after the labour and study of many years.” Saying which, he carefully put the piece of crucible into his pocket. “A melancholy reflection, sir, and might have been made by the bier of Alexander the Great or Julius Cæ sar, with the same propriety as upon this occasion.” “True, boy; even I, in despite of the influence of science, feel that I am but a piece of earth, and that to earth I must return; and I fear my day is not far distant,” replied M`Crea, in a solemn voice, his countenance increasing in longitude as he proceeded. “Oh! the curse of ignorance; why did you suffer that villanous farrier to bleed me?” “What serious injury do you apprehend from the loss of a few ounces of blood?” “It has confounded all my calculations; and now I am nothing more than a blind mortal like yourself. I had ascertained precisely the proportion of fluids and solids in my system, and being possessed of this knowledge, could have kept the machine in motion, until the burthen of life became too heavy to be supported. But the study of years has been subverted in an instant by the thumb lancet of a villanous bleeder. But it is as well perhaps as it is, since I have lived half a century without having yet discovered the use of living.” Smile not, courteous reader, at the infatuation of M`Crea, nor rashly pronounce his pursuit idle when compared with the various studies of his fellow man. Look among those whom the world pronounces learned, and how many do we find spending their lives in calculating the degree of heat in a moonbeam, or the thickness of a soap-bubble, and when they have discovered a rule by which the point may be ascertained with accuracy, they rest from their labours, satisfied that they have lived for the benefit of mankind, and that fame will inscribe their names in golden and imperishable characters in the record of science, though learned alone in such branches as give to wisdom the aspect of folly. Alice Grey was now seen slowly passing in front of the hut, her head bent down, and the hood of her cloak drawn over her face. Jurian could not conceal his emotion at this unexpected apparition, and M`Crea exchanged glances with captain Swain, that indicated his surprise at seeing her there. Still no one accosted her, and she passed on without turning her head either to the right or left. Her step was slow but unfaltering, and M`Crea stood at the door of the hut and looked after her, until she turned into another alley of the encampment and disappeared. “What can possibly have brought that woman here,” muttered the surgeon, “at this inclement season and so far from her home? Something of moment must have occurred.” “I hear that her daughter Miriam has deserted her,” replied the captain. M`Crea sighed, and Jurian changed colour. “Unhappy woman, she began life in sorrow, and in sorrow will it close.” “Touch not on that string,” exclaimed M`Crea, “or you awaken discord in my bosom more frightful than the jubilee of fiends. Touch not on that.” “Poor creature, she has more than paid the wages of sin.” “The wages of sin,” exclaimed M`Crea, “would be as a reward compared to what she has suffered; for the wages of sin is death, and she has endured through life pangs more poignant than the agonies of dying. And still she lives on without a prospect that they will ever be mitigated in this world. So far from it, that grief treads upon the heel of grief, and the last is the greatest.” Jurian withdrew from the hut, and M`Crea seated himself, and abruptly changed the conversation to a subject less painful. Half an hour had scarcely elapsed, VOL. II.—10 when Alice was again seen slowly returning along the narrow alley. Her mind was still absorbed in her feelings, and she made no reply to the occasional salutations of the soldiers in passing her, until she came in front of M`Crea's hut, when she paused, and stood in the door-way. “Why are you here, Alice; what is it you would have?” demanded M`Crea. “Help for the dying; human aid to keep a wretched being in this world who is anxious to flee to his God.” “Where shall I find the sufferer?” “In one of the out-houses belonging to the forge in the valley, but hasten, or death will have afforded him that relief which man has denied.” “Who is he that has awakened the sympathies of one more wretched than himself?” “A fellow mortal; he needs no stronger claim.” “What is his name?” “Will charity stand by the couch of a wretch, and withhold her aid until the name of the sufferer be spoken? Sorrow and sickness plead more forcibly in his behalf than the name by which he was known among the prosperous. Shall I say you will come and sooth the last hours of the dying?” “I am ill myself, Alice, but will procure you medical aid.” “Medical aid when the soul is bound to its tenement of clay by a spider's web!” replied Alice, in a tone of bitter derision. “You were sent for, and you alone; and have you the cruelty to deny the last wish of a dying man?” “I will see him.” “It is well. I will tell him you are coming, and though his soul had already spread its wings, those words would arrest its flight until you come. Farewell.” “Stay a few moments, and I will accompany you.” “And wherefore should they who have been a curse to each other in this world, walk side by side? Better that they be separated as far as the earth can divide them, when the fascination that led to crime has vanished, and nothing save its bitter consequences remains. Besides, I have that to do which must be done alone; however, I shall meet you at the place appointed, and partake of the poisoned chalice that we have prepared together for our own lips.” She turned from the door, and drawing her hood over her face, pursued her way; and the surgeon, after getting his apparel into better trim, for it had suffered wofully in the recent explosion, furnished himself with a lancet and medicines, and sallied forth to minister to the dying man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. — There is no wrong Like to the breach of wedlock; those injuries Are writ in marble time shall ne'er rase out. The hearts of such, if they be once divided, Will ne'er grow one again—sooner you may Call the spent day, or bid the stream return That long since slid beside you. Marmyon's Antiquary. When Jurian left the hut, he withdrew beyond the limits of the camp, for solitude to the morbid mind is preferable to society, though it increases the disease even while it seems to sooth. He sighed for a state of nature, for it appeared to him that the evils arising from society, as at present organized, far more than counterbalance the benefits conferred. The strong are upheld, while the weak are trampled on, and wealth is lavished on the prosperous, while the indigent are suffered to perish in their want. Presumptuous ignorance puts wisdom to the blush, and knavery well clad is noticed cap in hand, while honesty in rags is spurned and spit upon. Reflections of this nature led him some distance beyond the line of the encampment, and as he emerged from a wood, he discovered in the valley beneath, a horseman well mounted, in conversation with a female, walking slowly beside the horse. A second look satisfied him that it was Gordon and Alice Grey, and when he recollected what had transpired when they last met, no doubt remained that Miriam was the cause of the present interview. As Jurian approached, Gordon descried him, and abruptly breaking off the conversation, clapped spurs to his horse, and disappeared along the winding of the valley, while Alice entered the wood, and commenced gathering from beneath the snow a bundle of the fallen branches, upon which she was employed when Jurian approached. He accosted her, and from her manner he did not suppose that she was yet acquainted with his conduct toward Miriam, for her answer was mild, and the passions that he believed inseparable from her nature were apparently subdued. Neither look nor motion betrayed what was passing in her mind. “Who was that parted from you, mother Alice, as I descended the hill?” “One who can feel for the forlorn state of the widow and the orphan.” “And yet a villain!” “Of that I know not. Man may be an angel of light to one, and yet a devil to the rest of the world. By his acts towards me alone do I adjudge him, and let others decide upon the evidence within their knowledge.” “Beware, for I know the man.” “Impossible, for there is not that man on earth that another may say, `I know him.' We know not our own hearts, with which we daily commune, and yet arrogantly adjudge others from a single action that may not accord with our unsettled notions of right and wrong.” Alice, as she spoke, turned not her head, but continued gathering her bundle of faggots. “For what purpose are you gathering that wood?” demanded Jurian. “To warm the dying, and keep the stream still flowing that the hand of death has already chilled.” “And who is it, good mother, that claims your pious care?” 10* “One who has repeatedly called upon your name, for he would see you again before his eyes are sealed forever. I mean Corwin, that man of many woes.” “Where is he? direct me to him, for him of all men do I most desire to see.” “Come along with me, and you shall be satisfied.” She raised her billet of wood upon her shoulder, and moved towards the path that led to the forge. Jurian offered to relieve her of her burden, but she replied— “No; let my sufferings be as bitter as adversity can heap upon me; let my pride be prostrate, and my spirit broken, that not one spark may remain of that earthly vanity which leads to sin.” They descended by the narrow path through the wood into the valley, and after a silent walk of a few minutes, they paused in front of a temporary shed which had formerly been employed as a coal-house to the neighbouring forge. “Enter,” said Alice, “and you will find the wretched man here.” On a bundle of straw, wrapped up in a foul blanket, lay the emaciated form of the suffering Corwin. In the centre of the hovel were a few dying embers, the smoke from which escaped by an aperture in the roof occasioned by the storm. Alice threw down her faggot, and bending by the fire began to rekindle it, while the sick man raised his head, and inquired in a feeble voice who had entered with her. On being answered, he sighed— “Thank God, I shall see the boy again before I die.” Jurian approached the spot where Corwin was lying, and taking his cold and bony hand, said— “It grieves me to see that you have been so sorely visited.” “My trials have been many and severe,” said the sick man, “but mourn not for me—rather rejoice, for I am going where the weary are at rest.” To Jurian's inquiry how he had escaped from the enemy, he replied, that being looked upon as a harmless wretch, and permitted to go at large, an opportunity soon presented itself of passing the lines, and he was urged to seize upon it from the restlessness of his nature, though every spot on earth was alike to him. “As the existence of each of us,” continued the mendicant, “has in a very material degree governed the fate of the other, I was anxious to make known to you the circumstances of my life, while breath is spared me. The brief career of thine is fully known. A cup of water, Alice, for my lips are feverish, and my throat so parched that I can scarcely breathe.” She brought the water, and stood beside him in silence. “Thank you.” He took the cup, but was unable to drink. “Raise me gently; my frame is so wasted and cramped with cold, that the slightest touch is torture. Softly, or I shall expire.” She raised him, and he drank, but the exertion nearly exhausted his strength. While she was busy about him, tears started in her eyes, and coursed down the furrows in her cheeks, which Corwin beheld, but breathed not a word of condolence. He desired Jurian to approach, when Alice withdrew to the fire, and busied herself in preparing some refreshment for the sick man, who proceeded in his narrative in a tremulous and broken voice— “I was born in Virginia, of wealthy parentage, and as I was an only child my education was suited to the fortune I was to inherit. My parents were doatingly fond of me, and their affection was not misplaced, for every act of kindness made my heart swell with gratitude, and I looked upon the world as a Paradise, without a serpent in it. I had never felt a pang, and could not conceive an idea of human suffering. Behold me now! “The first blow that awoke me from the bright vision of this world, was the death of my venerated father. It was a heavy one, but my mother was still remaining, though no longer the cheerful and happy woman that had watched over my childhood, for what are the vanities of this world to the widow! My mother was perfectly resigned to her fate; fulfilled all the duties of life; and mourned not her loss with irreligious tears; but still her smiles were buried in the grave with my father. “My feelings towards the world were gradually changed. The loss of one parent redoubled my solicitude and affection for the other; but at the expiration of three years her earthly sorrows terminated, and mine increased to an appalling magnitude. When our affections become bankrupt in this world, we naturally turn to heaven for consolation—and no one, however severely stricken, can ask for it in vain. I felt this conviction, and thought that my life could not be better employed than in endeavouring to persuade the skeptic to the same opinion. I was still a young man of extensive property when holy orders were conferred upon me. This world again looked cheerful. I dwelt in the mansion of my fathers, and `blessed was my basket and my store.”' Corwin paused to recover himself, for the effort of speaking had exhausted his strength, and Alice concealed her face in her lap and gave vent to her tears. The attention of the sick man was awakened by her sobbing; he cast a look at her; a tear started in his eye, which he hastily wiped away, and proceeded with his narrative. “I will not attempt to describe the serenity of that period, the comparison with the present might prove too much for my feeble brain, for I have too often, in the midst of my sufferings, impiously cried, `what is my strength, that I should hope; and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?' But God gave me strength to hope, and life, however abject, still seemed a blessing—though I have seen friends pass away as the course of the eagle, and have had this devoted head anointed with sorrow that consumed me to the very bones. Had my strength been the strength of stones, or my flesh of brass, I could not have endured more patiently.” His recollection became painful, and his imagination wandering: he sunk upon his pallet of straw, until sufficiently recovered to proceed. “About two years after I entered on my holy functions, a young woman appeared in the village where I resided. She was lovely, and her mind was above the ordinary level;—it was, however, tinctured with melancholy, which to me was an additional attraction, and though an entire stranger, her manners and appearance gained her the confidence and respect of the most reputable families of the village. We became intimate, and she gained my affections. My whole soul was devoted to her, and we were married. Time passed on swiftly, and each succeeding day awoke me to new enjoyment. There was still a shade of melancholy over the lovely features of my wife, but as I considered it constitutional, I did not urge her to assign a cause. I could not have conceived so angelic a being capable of an action, the remembrance of which would overcast her countenance with sorrow. My solicitude gradually dissipated the gloom; at least she appeared more cheerful when in my presence; and I flattered myself her mind was perfectly restored. “Our loves were blessed with a daughter. Who can describe the feelings of a parent upon the birth of his first offspring! Until that occurrence my feelings had been in the bud; but they now blossomed. I was awakened to new life; and looked upon the world through different optics. If I loved my wife before, I now adored her, and my soul was never at rest but when hovering around her and child. My measure of earthly joy was full; but there was a smack of bitter in the cup that poisoned all. “About three years after my marriage, a traveller rode up to my door and alighted; as I went out to welcome him he advanced, and accosting me by name, shook me cordially by the hand, and expressed his satisfaction at our meeting. I retained a faint recollection of his features, but could not remember where I had seen him before. Perceiving my embarrassment, he introduced himself by name, and proved to be an early college acquaintance, and one for whom I had entertained sentiments of regard. I had not seen him since he was a youth of seventeen, and ten years had expired, making a considerable alteration in his features. I rejoiced at the meeting, and pressed him, if it would not interfere with his business, to pass some days with me. He stated that he was travelling to the south, but his business was not so urgent but that he could accept of my invitation. His horse was taken to a stable, and we proceeded to the parlour where I had left my wife sewing but a few moments before. She was still seated on the sofa, engaged with her needle, when we entered. She arose to receive us. I introduced my friend by name; she uttered a piercing shriek, and fainted on the sofa. “The stranger had skill in medicine—he applied the remedies the nature of the case required, and my wife was speedily restored to her senses. She was still much agitated and feeble, and apologised for the awkward occurrence, which she attributed to recent sickness, which she said had shattered her nervous system to an alarming degree. I credited it all; for I should as soon have questioned the veracity of a saint, as suppose my wife capable of dissimulation. As she still felt faint, she excused herself and retired to her chamber to recover her spirits, assuring us that an hour's rest would perfectly restore her. “The stranger and myself walked out to view my improvements, and talk of our early recollections, and the events of our lives since we separated at college. Meetings of this kind, are as rays of light crossing the gloomy pathway of life. When at college he was a wild youth, obeying no law but such as his own pleasure prescribed, and was considered a libertine both in principle and practice. His manners were fascinating, and his conversation pleasing and instructive. He was generous and brave—romantically so—but his religious principles were vague, and his moral conduct undecided. He was a polished scholar, and even at that early age could read character intuitively, and had the power to make whomsoever he pleased his friend. I became sincerely attached to him. “Ten years had made a striking change in his deportment. The levity of youth had disappeared, and the sedateness of age was already on his brow. He appeared ten years older than he actually was; and his mind had improved in the same proportion. Wisdom dwelt upon his lips, and virtue now found an advocate in his tongue. I hailed his conversion with a glad heart, and imagined I beheld in the friend of my youth a suitable companion for my riper years. My wife appeared at the tea table perfectly recovered, and more cheerful than usual, though still pale, which I attributed to her indisposition in the morning. The stranger was at first reserved, but gradually entered with spirit into conversation. He had travelled much, and nothing seemed to have escaped his penetrating observation;— he had read much, and profited by what he read. We listened to him with delight, and new life seemed to kindle in the eyes of my wife as the words flowed from his tongue. “Two months had passed away cheerfully, when one evening he expressed his intention of proceeding on his journey the following day. My wife changed colour, and faltered out, `you will not leave us yet?' It came to my senses as nothing more than an expression of civility, though to him it conveyed a far different meaning. I also entreated him to prolong his visit, but he excused himself by saying, that though his wishes inclined that way, his affairs would not admit of it. “It was a calm evening in autumn,—the moon was shining serenely, and invited us to walk abroad. We strolled along the banks of a river which flowed in front of my dwelling, and as we drew near the humble cottage of one of my parishioners, a child ran towards us, and exclaimed, sobbing—`Oh! sir, my grandmother is dying, and wishes to see you before she dies.' I desired my friend and wife to pursue their walk, while I followed the weeping child to attend to my parochial duties. I found an aged woman at the point of death, and her descendants mourning around her. I administered hope to the troubled spirit, and remained with her about an hour when she breathed her last. I then withdrew, that I might not interrupt the feelings of the mourners; for grief is not to be subdued at the flood with consolation. “When I arrived at my home, the lights had burnt nearly to the socket, and my wife had not returned. I was astonished at the length of her absence, but imagined she had visited some one of my neighbours, and with this thought I sat down contentedly to read. Another hour elapsed, and still they did not return. My astonishment increased, and my alarm was excited lest some accident had occurred, and accordingly I called up one of my men-servants to go out with me to ascertain the cause of their absence. We met them at the door; there was evident confusion in the countenances of both, but as they stated they had passed the evening at the house of a neighbour, and had hurried home on discovering the night so far advanced, I attributed their excitement to this cause. We retired to rest, and the following morning our guest took his departure. “From that hour my wife relapsed into her former melancholy, which I in vain endeavoured to dispel, for my solicitude only served to increase her sorrow. Every attempt to probe the cause proved fruitless: she constantly evaded my questions, and appeared relieved when the subject was changed. She never mentioned the name of our late guest, and when it passed my lips, she betrayed an involuntary shudder. I accidentally met the neighbour, at whose house they gave me to understand they had passed the evening. I rallied him for keeping such unseasonable hours, and detaining systematic housewives from their families; but he recollected nothing of the visit, and stated my wife had not been at his house for a month previous. This was to me inexplicable,—and the doubt arose, `Has she then been guilty of falsehood!' but my heart disclaimed the suspicion, and I returned to my fireside— she was seated there, her needle in her hand. I fixed my eyes upon her countenance—it was melancholy. She raised her eyes to mine, and she never appeared half so dear to me as at that moment. I turned from her gaze, and sighed, `if this be guilt, what garb must innocence assume?' I then kissed her, resolving to banish all suspicion, and my conduct towards her was now more affectionate than before, if possible.” “It was, it was,” cried Alice, “to the grave I shall never forget it.” The foregoing recital was repeatedly interrupted by the sobbings of Alice, which became loud and bitter as memory recalled the scenes of happiness that her guilt had destroyed. Corwin proceeded— “A month passed away, and the melancholy of my wife increased. My solicitude was redoubled, but she received with coldness all my attentions, and my caresses with disgust. I proposed travelling, to divert her mind, but she declined it. I pressed her to make known to me her secret cause of grief, if any existed; and she fell upon my neck in tears, and then withdrew to her chamber. She remained there for several hours, and when I sought her again to sooth her feelings, I found her employed in writing. She extended her hand to me as I entered, and said she felt better, but desired to be alone. I kissed her and left her. She again sat down at her desk and continued writing, and VOL. II.—11 I did not see her until the evening. She came to the tea-table, and conversed more cheerfully than usual. She caressed our little daughter repeatedly, and handed her to me to receive my blessings. I shall never forget that evening. The child was more playful than usual; and as I turned to my wife, and reflected that she was the mother of that child, my love increased almost to adoration. It was the happiest hour I ever experienced, but it was the last hour of happiness I have known. We retired to rest at the usual hour; but the next morning when I awoke both my wife and child were missing, and no trace remained of the direction they had taken. After a long and fruitless search, I returned disconsolate and heart-broken. I entered my study, and as I threw myself in a chair in an agony of grief, I beheld a letter lying on the table before me. It was in my wife's handwriting, and addressed to me. I trembled in every limb as I broke the seal, and my eyes wandered vacantly over the characters. She stated that a sense of her own worthlessness had driven her from me, for she could no longer endure a life of duplicity. That my caresses were torture, since she had wronged me, and was a guilty and heart-broken being; for the friend I had received at my fireside had betrayed me. She conjured me to forget her, but was that in nature! The paper fell from my hand, for my whole frame shook as if the palsy of age had smitten it; my brain whirled in the confusion of half formed thought. I laughed wildly, for I saw madness coming on, and at every stride I laughed and laughed, until the horrid vacancy of my own voice startled me back to a sense of reason; and then I stood before my God, awed as if his finger had been laid upon me, and from the very depth of my soul I called upon him to curse the guilty pair.” “And the malediction was heard, for he has cursed them,” exclaimed Alice. “May endless remorse corrode the hearts of the wretches who could thus repay your kindness!” responded Jurian. “Peace, peace, thou deserted one,” cried Corwin, “they should be curst, they have been curst, but not by thee, O no! not by thee.” “By every one who has a sense of virtue—may heaven in its justice—” “Hold, hold, unnatural boy—you know not what you do—they were your parents,” exclaimed a voice from another part of the building. “God of heaven!”—Jurian turned and discovered that the voice proceeded from M`Crea, who had entered unperceived during the foregoing. “The serpent has come in time to see the end of his own work,” cried Corwin, and laughing wildly, fell exhausted upon his pallet of straw. “Father and mother both,” exclaimed M`Crea, “now while before you, complete the punishment due to their offence, and curse them. It is right that guilt should create its own punishment, and the fruits of guilt curse the guilty.” “Ay, let the fruits of guilt curse the guilty,” cried the maniac, and the building again resounded with the wildness of his laughter. “Father and mother both!” uttered Jurian, in a voice nearly choked with emotion—“art thou my mother?” “I know not that,” replied Alice; “he best can tell, for he had charge of the evidence of our crime.” “She is your mother,” replied M`Crea. “Thou art her first born—a child of shame, for she was a mother before she beheld that injured man.” Jurian stood silent and motionless as a statue, while horror was strongly depicted in his countenance. Corwin continued to laugh convulsively, and Alice proceeded in hurried and wild accents that betrayed her remorse— “O God! that I had never seen him—never wronged him—never reduced him to this abject condition! I then might hope, and should not fear to die.” She approached Jurian, who still stood as motionless as if he had been transformed to stone: “But you, my son, will not despise and shun me. I have been guilty— too guilty to hope for pardon; but I have been penitent and wretched—so wretched that my heart has been broken with the fulness of my affliction.” “And mine has been broken too,” cried Corwin, and laughed aloud. “The world has heaped reproaches on me,” continued Alice—“mankind has persecuted and trampled on me. I merited all, and bore all without repining. But you, my son, will not spurn me, you will not despise and upbraid me. Let me sink to the grave, and do not reproach my ashes.” “Let me sink to the grave, let me sink to the grave,” responded Corwin. Alice fell upon the neck of the youth, but he was still silent and motionless, as though a thunderbolt had transfixed him to the earth. “Speak to me, my son,” she continued, “it matters not how great my offences against the rest of the world, nothing can dissolve the link that exists between us. Though degraded and guilty, remember I am your mother still, and to embitter the remnant of my life is to entail a curse upon thy own head. One that you may not hope to escape, for it will surely light upon you before you reach the grave. Speak to me, I conjure you, speak to me.” Jurian remained insensible to the appeal, and apparently unconscious of what was passing before him. Alice turned from him in despair— “He will not speak to me! The guilty mother kneels to her son in vain—the offspring spurns the author of his being!” Corwin called to M`Crea, in a voice scarcely articulate; the surgeon turned to him, and the wretched man continued with a vacant laugh, pointing at the stricken beings before him— “This is your work, this is your work! The ways of crime are seldom so intricate but they may be unravelled at last. This is your work, I say, this is your work!” His voice was lost in the rattling in his throat, and was succeeded by a vacant chuckling laugh. He stretched his emaciated limbs, and a convulsive shudder agitated his whole frame, but still he kept his eye fixed on Alice and Jurian. M`Crea stood mutely beside him, horror-struck at the fatal consequences of his crime. He watched the changes in the maniac's countenance, and taking his hand, of which the other appeared unconscious, felt his pulse, which throbbed as a single thread along his shrunken limb. He then laid his hand upon the bosom of the dying man, to feel the pulsations of his heart. Alice seated herself at his feet, but Jurian had not yet moved, for there was one thought that absorbed every faculty. She is my mother; then what is Miriam! The rattling in Corwin's throat increased, and he breathed with greater difficulty. “You are dying,” said M`Crea, in a low voice. “I know it—could my mother have foreseen that such would have been my death-bed, would she have rejoiced, think you, when I was born?” “Pray, Corwin, pray.” “And what is there in a death-bed prayer? Thank God I have prayed through life.” “And have you forgiven those who wronged you?” “Heaven is no place for earthly passion,” replied the dying man. “Be all animosities settled in this world. Mine are settled; and now there is but one to stand between me and my God.” “And he?—” “Will plead for me.” “Press my hand in token that you die in peace with all mankind.” 11* Corwin stretched out his hand, already as cold as stone, which the surgeon eagerly grasped, but the other was too feeble to return the pressure. “Press it,” repeated the surgeon, “or make some sign that you forgive.” Corwin struggled to speak, his lips moved, but no sound passed them; still the expression of his countenance denoted that every spark of rancour had departed from his bosom. M`Crea again pressed the cold hand with energy—his heart was too full to speak, and he fixed his eyes on those of the dying man, who steadfastly returned the gaze, and appeared to read what was passing in the mind of the penitent M`Crea. A guard now entered the building with captain Graham at their head, who approached Jurian, and said— “Lieutenant Hartfield, we are come in pursuit of you, with orders to place you under arrest.” Jurian turned to him with a vacant look, that betrayed that he did not understand the import of what was said. Alice was roused by their entrance, and started to her feet. “Upon what charge?” demanded M`Crea. “One that I trust can never be substantiated,” replied Graham, “he is accused of being a spy in the British service.” “And who has ventured to make so preposterous a charge?” “There stands his accuser,” replied Graham, pointing at Alice, whose restless glance passed rapidly from one object to another, and every moment became wilder and wilder. “Woman, can this be so? and have you attempted the life of your own son?” demanded M`Crea. “Her own son!” exclaimed all present in amazement. “We have reached the last link in the chain of crime,” muttered Corwin, in a voice scarcely above his breath. “Speak, wretched woman, what led you to commit an act so unnatural as this?” “Madness!” shrieked Alice. “I am destined through life to commit crime after crime, and each succeeding act is more appalling than that which has gone before. Murder my own son! husband and son both murdered by me! What is there left for me to perpetrate more damning than that already done. Point it out; I am ready; there is no escape—my destiny must be fulfilled. My own life by my own hand, is the only deed worthy of one so blackened, and that would insure the punishment merited by a career of ignominy and guilt.” “Lead me to prison,” said Jurian to Graham. “Do not leave me,” cried Alice, throwing herself upon his neck, “do not leave me—no sooner found than lost! O! Jurian, I will forswear what I have said. Hear me, he is as innocent as the babe unborn. I was mad when I accused him—I did it in obedience to the malice of another, but now I say it is false. Hear me! Ye will not take away the life of a man upon the testimony of one too guilty herself to live!” Jurian released her hold and beckoned to M`Crea to receive her, and then turning to captain Graham, said— “I am ready; do your duty,” and they moved a few paces towards the entrance to the building. “Hold, ye men of blood!” cried Alice, ye would not have a mother murder her own son! Hear me, I say he is innocent. Ye will not drag him to a death of shame upon the accusation of one whose life has been one unbroken tissue of shame! Are ye men, and yet destitute of mercy? Ye shall not tear us asunder; if he is to die, let me die with him.” She broke from M`Crea, and again threw her arms frantically around the neck of Jurian. “Take her away,” said the young man, in a cold tone, that chilled for a moment the fervid feelings of Alice. “And now,” continued he, “take me away also.” “That voice freezes my blood! Stay, stay, my son, nor hasten to a death of shame!” “Mother,” replied Jurian, calmly, “I owe to you a life of shame, and it is right that I should be indebted to you for a shameful death also.” Alice sunk into the arms of M`Crea, while Jurian motioned to the guard to conduct him from the building, and his miserable parents were left alone. The shades of night were fast approaching, and the piercing wind carried along with it a dirgelike strain as it swept over the waste of snow. The wretched pair stood silent until the receding tread of the soldiers, breaking through the encrusted surface, was no longer heard, and they hung upon that sound as though it had been a note of joy, for it seemed to disarm despair of half its poignancy. The wretched never feel the extent of their wretchedness until left to commune with their own thoughts, where no human sound may reach them, and call them back to what is passing in this world. When the footsteps of the soldiers were no longer heard, Alice turned to M`Crea, and said in a low tremulous voice— “How silent it is!—Speak to me, M`Crea, though you heap reproaches on me—I care not, so I hear a human voice, for it is as fearfully silent here as though we were among the dead.” “And we are with the dead,” responded M`Crea. She turned her eyes towards Corwin, who had expired, and seeing that he lay motionless, she hurried to him, and placed her hand upon his forehead, but recoiled at the touch, and shrieked— “Cold as stone! the damps of death are there! his eyes are fixed and glazed! O God! he has gone without pardoning me!” “Not so; your fault was forgiven; he died in peace with all mankind.” “Impossible! He has not, he could not pardon me, but has died with all his bitter feelings towards me still fresh in his mind, and there they will remain appalling evidence against me in heaven, as they have been in this world. I did hope that offence might have been expiated here, but he is dead, and now there is no hope left.” “I say he pardoned you, and his last breath was a prayer for those who wronged him.” “What is there on earth that I would not give to have heard that prayer!” She gazed fixedly upon the face of Corwin, and bursting into an agony of tears, kissed him repeatedly, all the while exclaiming, “O! that I had heard that prayer!” When her feelings had in some measure subsided, M`Crea proposed going to the camp to procure assistance to remove the body, and leave Alice to watch by it until his return. “I fear not the living,” she replied, “but I may not stay alone with the dead.” He then directed her to go and acquaint Mauns Talman with what had occurred, and he would await her return. Alice left the building, and he rekindled the fire, and seated himself beside the inanimate clay, and communed with it, as though it still retained all the faculties of life. And where is he who has not spoken to the dead, and for a moment fancied that he was understood! While gazing on the deserted tenement of the soul, it requires a struggle to believe that the form, but late elastic with life, and through which the ethereal essence moved so mysteriously, imparting its influence to every atom, that they appeared to be one and indivisible—the master-work of the master-hand—it requires a struggle, I say, to reconcile the mind to the idea that an eternal divorce has taken place, that all the exquisite faculties of that complicated work have been in an instant paralyzed and forever, and that he who had usurped all things to his own use, has been hurled from the summit of his arrogance to the insignificance of the clod of the valley, without a solitary attribute remaining superior to the dust with which he is doomed to mingle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. No funeral rites, nor man in mournful weeds, Nor mournful bell shall ring his burial. —Shakspeare. May I not take mine ease in mine inn? —Ib. The morning succeeding the events related in the preceding chapter, captain Swain was despatched with a foraging corps with instructions to impress not only provender for the garrison, but such articles of clothing as the possessors would not willingly part with, as the troops were perishing with cold. He was averse to the expedition, as he could not find it on record that his illustrious ancestor had ever resorted to similar means of sustaining his army, and our worthy captain eschewed all modern innovations. There was not a post and rail fence to be seen on his whole farm, as he gave a decided preference to the zigzag means of enclosure introduced by his Swedish ancestors, and when one of his neighbours tried the experiment of a hawthorn hedge, the worthy captain pronounced him without qualification a fit subject for bedlam. He carried his primitive notions so far, that to the day of his death he had his coat cut after the fashion of one that belonged to his grandfather, and most religiously believed that every departure from that venerated model tended to render the human form divine, ridiculous, and was an approach towards barbarism. What would be the feelings of the honest old grazier, could he witness the present age of rail-roads and canals, in which fashion undergoes mutation before our clothes are dismissed from the taylor's shopboard, and inventions succeed each other in such rapid succession, that we have not time to give one a fair trial before our attention is attracted to another! The sun was just rising as captain Swain, at the head of the foraging party, left the camp. It had rained during the night, and the trees and surrounding objects, encased in ice, sparkled in the feeble rays of the morning sun as though they had been hung with gems. The snow was encrusted, and lay in dazzling whiteness before them as far as the eye could extend, and as they moved on, they seemed to pass through `a world of entire chrysolite.' Every twig and blade of grass was hung with diamonds, and nature in her desolation appeared in a few hours to have been transformed into a fairy region, and the stirring notes of the reveille added to the illusion. The foragers had not proceeded far from the camp, when on the sunny side of a hill, near the forge mentioned in the last chapter, they beheld a group of four beneath a spreading oak, two of whom were busily employed in shovelling away the snow, and the others were standing mournfully at a short distance contemplating an object lying on the ground. The group was silent, and as the foragers approached they recognised in one of the labourers sergeant Talman, whom they hailed, but he returned no answer, nor did he as much as raise his head at the salutation. He continued his work, and the two beings who stood near him were too much engrossed with their own feelings to attend to what was passing. The foragers halted at the foot of the acclivity, curious to know what that silent group was about, which another glance explained—they were performing the last rites to the dead. Not a word was spoken by the group on the hill, while conjecture passed from one soldier to another as to whose mortal remains commanded this unusual mark of distinction. They had been in the habit of seeing their comrades consigned in an indiscriminate mass to one common grave. Captain Swain no sooner recognised M`Crea and Alice standing by the body than all was plain to him, and he commanded his troop to move forward, and they left the mourners to perform their melancholy duty. They proceeded along the valley that led to the river, and the solemn scene was not yet out of view, when one of a widely different nature presented itself. A burst of wild revelry saluted their ears, and after riding around a hillock, thickly covered with scrubby pine, they came in full view of the river, and immediately discovered whence the sound proceeded. On the bank of the Schuylkill was a company of about twenty soldiers seated around a large fire, before which was an entire hog roasting. Liquor was circulating freely, their mirth was boisterous, and the foragers were forcibly struck with the contrast between this scene and that they had left a few moments previous. The revellers proved to be certain officers of the Virginia line, and others. Captain Swain and his company halted; and one of a swarthy complexion, dark heavy eyebrows, and large and commanding features, approached and exclaimed— “Captain will you partake of our barbacue? you will find it wholesome, though not as palatable as it might be.” He was of the middle stature, and of a slender form. His dark eye was penetrating and serious, while a smile enlivened the lower part of his countenance: his dress was that of a confirmed sloven, or in other words, a man whose mind is superior to things of that nature, but his equipments indicated an officer of no ordinary grade. Captain Swain politely declined the invitation. “Come, captain, and partake with us,” cried Graham, who was among them, “there is no treason in the feast: for the devil has long been exorcised from hog's flesh.” Others spoke more plainly, from which it appeared that the company consisted of those who were desirous of having Washington removed from the chief command of the American forces. “What duty are you upon?” inquired the officer who first addressed the descendant of Sven Schute. “To forage the neighbourhood,” was the reply. “A politic mode of conducting a campaign. Are you in an enemy's country, that you sally forth to plunder, and wrest from the hand of the needy labourer his last morsel of sustenance?” “Our magazines are exhausted, and they must be replenished speedily, or famine will be in the garrison,” replied Swain. “Pretty management, by G—,” exclaimed the other, curling his lip with contempt,” after a distressing campaign, which has disheartened the soldiers and worn them to skeletons, you enter winter quarters in miserable huts, without clothes, blankets, or straw; or even as much as a dry biscuit in your stores. Fine management, truly! Have you an army of chameleons, that you expect them to endure all this patiently?” “We hope to remedy the evil by taking it in hand at an early period.” “It should never have existed,” replied the other, “and had competent men had the control of affairs, it never would have existed. But you modern Quixotes have not work enough with the enemy, but you must create a hydra, merely for the pleasure of lopping off its numberless heads. Why were not provisions secured before we hutted? and why are the soldiers suffered to run naked, while there is an abundance of clothing provided for the army rotting upon the road and in the woods, for the want of means to bring it to the camp?” VOL. II.—12 “As that subject is not embraced within my line of duty, I am unable to give a satisfactory answer,” replied captain Swain, and the officer withdrew towards the fire in silence. Corporal Drone, who was much more partial to eating than fighting, hearing that there was to be a barbacue near the Schuylkill that morning, he made it his business to stroll that way, and trust to his wits to help him to a share of the feast. He was accordingly upon the field of action before the company arrived; and when they came, he officiously offered his services to build the fire, attend to their horses, prepare the pork for cooking, or any menial office that might be considered a sufficient excuse for his remaining in the company. This worthy, finding that his threadbare rifle shirt was not altogether adapted to the season, no sooner heard that captain Swain was on a foraging expedition, than he volunteered his services to accompany him, with the hope that his wardrobe might be replenished before he returned to camp. The corporal was one of that numerous class, who consider mankind in no other light than as tenants in common, in regard to the things of this world; he had not yet acquired sufficient Latin to discover the difference between meum et tuum, and in consequence of his defective education, he was continually mistaking the property of other people for his own. Or perhaps the corporal acted upon the broad principle of natural law, which says that possession alone gives right, and as soon as the possessor relinquishes his hold, the property reverts to the common stock, and is at the service of whoever may wish to employ it. Or perhaps the corporal did not trouble his head much about the subtleties of the law, or care much in whom the right of property was vested, so that he had actual possession. Be this as it may, the corporal had of late become weary of marching and countermarching; and meeting with a half starved Rosinante in his travels, when a little leg-weary, he patriotically devoted him to the service of his country, without as much as asking permission of the owner. This charger was now fastened to a laurel bush hard by, endeavouring to quell an intestine war by mumbling a few dried leaves, with as much earnestness as if they had been corn or luxuriant clover. Drone no sooner saw the foragers about to depart, than he bestrode his war-horse, and shambled after them, though his stomach exclaimed loudly against leaving the barbacue untouched—and the corporal was a humane man to his own stomach—but his back cried aloud for covering, and after much perplexity he listened with becoming charity to its petition. The foragers not being very successful along the river, for the British had already been over the ground, changed their route, and took a southerly direction. After a ride of about two hours, they came in sight of Ephraim Horne's house, a substantial stone building, which indicated the prosperity of the possessor. The political principles of Ephraim were well known, and as it was suspected that in disposing of his provisions he preferred receiving British gold to continental paper, the party approached the house with fewer compunctious visitings than they would, had he been friendly to the cause, or passively inimical. Ephraim saw the troop approaching, and though greatly alarmed at such an unwelcome sight, he hastened to the front of his house, to ascertain the object of this unexpected visit. It was with difficulty he mustered sufficient courage to sustain the interview, for as he had been to the city within the preceding week, his conscience whispered there was danger to be apprehended. He was therefore considerably relieved when captain Swain announced to him their business. Ephraim expressed his regret, but protested he had no provisions on his farm, as the enemy had been there a few weeks before, and swept every thing away. Corporal Drone was as well acquainted with Ephraim's premises as he was himself, and was not ignorant of the stock he had on hand; and as the corporal at present considered it expedient to make himself both conspicuous and useful, he quietly slid from his garran and disappeared, while the farmer was giving a piteous account of the imaginary losses he had sustained by the depredations of the British. The quaker spoke so smoothly, that captain Swain credited implicitly all he said, and was about proceeding, when the corporal appeared, driving three fat steers before him. Ephraim turned pale at the sight, and approached, with the intention of driving them back. “Hold,” cried the corporal, interposing, “it is true these steers were designed for the British market, but they must turn their heads in another direction.” “You do not mean to rob me?” “Not at all,” replied the other, “you will be liberally paid in continental paper for every pound we take; but as it would be treason in us to leave these fat steers—” “Treason! what does thee mean? it will be barefaced robbery if thee takes them.” “But treason if we leave them,” interrupted Drone, “for they will certainly find their way to the city to feed the enemy. So they must go along with us, and you should thank me for saving your conscience from such a reproach, and perhaps your neck from a halter.” Ephraim, upon the mention of a halter, thought proper to drop the altercation, and captain Swain desired him to set a price upon his steers, which was accordingly done, allowing a liberal advance upon receiving depreciated paper instead of sterling coin. While this was transacting, the corporal drew nigh to the door, which being partly open, he had a view of the hall, in which, from a row of pegs, he beheld a portion of Ephraim's wardrobe suspended. Drone glided in, and instantly appeared, with a drab quaker coat over his torn rifle shirt, and a surtout across his arm— “Captain Swain, while your hand is in, you may as well strike a bargain for these articles, which come within the letter of our warrant.” Ephraim expostulated. “For shame of yourself,” continued the corporal, “Saint Martin divided his mantle with a beggar, and as you are a good christian you should imitate so praiseworthy an example.” As Ephraim was well clad, these additional coats were considered superfluous; he therefore expostulated in vain, for though the case was a hard one, yet the emergencies of the army would not admit of an argument as to the justice of the measure: the quaker was obliged to set a price upon his apparel, which was paid, and the soldiers departed, driving the steers before them. Ephraim stood watching them with a heavy heart until they were out of sight, and then cast a sorrowful look upon his paper money. His mortification was twofold, as he had intended the following day to drive his cattle to Philadelphia, and transmute them into gold. Two of the soldiers took charge of the provender collected, and returned towards Valley Forge; the rest of the party continued their search through the counties of Chester and Delaware. The corporal had no sooner accomplished the object that induced him to volunteer his services, than his zeal evaporated, and he availed himself of the first opportunity of taking French leave, to the no small satisfaction of his wretched garran, who was all unused to the rapid locomotion employed by the troopers. The corporal now being at liberty to follow his own inclination, turned his horse's head in the direction of the Crooked Billet, for it was a custom he observed most religiously, never to pass within three miles of Nicholas's tavern, without stopping to inquire after the health of that worthy personage, and at the same time drink to it in a glass of Geneva, if he could get credit for the value of the liquor. A tavern sign maintained an influence over the corporal, 12* corresponding with that of the north pole over the magnetic needle. He could never pass without turning, and seldom without stopping. On his way to the Crooked Billet, one of these signs that ruled his destiny caught his eye—it was the Seven Stars—and the corporal was always disposed to study astronomy when he beheld his horoscope so near him. His horse also had a like propensity with his master, and when he halted in front of the inn, Drone felt exceedingly compassionate towards the dumb beast, and dismounted that he might breathe and be fed, after the unusual exertion of the morning. He accordingly directed his horse to be taken care of, entered the inn and ordered dinner for himself in a tone as commanding as if he had intended to pay for it, for Drone was a decided autocrat where he imagined he had a right to command. We occasionally meet with this feature in the minds of the loudest declaimers against arbitrary power. The corporal drew forth his pipe, lighted it, and taking the choicest seat before the fire, made himself perfectly at home. He talked politics to the landlord, and recounted his military exploits to the landlady and her daughter, until they imagined that the destiny of the new states was at the disposal of their unknown guest. Their humble roof had never been so highly honoured, and the corporal perceiving the impression he had made, assumed a patronising air, and invited the whole family to dine with him, instead of inviting himself to dine with the family, which was his original intention. A distinction without a difference, for it amounted to the same thing to all parties in the end. What with smoking, talking, eating, and drinking, the corporal found himself in comfortable quarters, and so much was he delighted with his entertainment, to which he did ample justice, that he protested roundly, that for the future he would take that inn under his especial protection, and evinced his friendly disposition by suggesting various alterations, such as removing the bar to another part of the room, converting the door into a window, and a window into a door, tearing down a stack of chimneys on this side, and running up another on the opposite; by widening the piazza, building a new kitchen, and retouching the Seven Stars, for they appeared to be under a cloud—he suggested twenty other improvements, most of which were as impracticable to mine host as a pilgrimage to the moon, but still they tended to impress him with vast ideas of the importance of his guest, which was the mark the corporal aimed at. He belonged to that numerous herd that plan palaces for others to build, without the means within themselves to construct a pigstye, and who talk largely of the luxuries of life, even while they sit cross-legged to conceal the rent in their apparel. There is no one so abject but that he imagines himself capable of planning for the comfort of another, and his fingers itch to put his schemes in execution, in order to afford the world an example how to live. Evening was now approaching, and the gathering clouds in the west portended a coming storm. The corporal bethought him that it was time to move towards the Crooked Billet, satisfied that he would meet with comfortable quarters there, and a hearty welcome from Nicholas, who was a good-natured fellow in the main, and fond of having his joke with the corporal, who was nothing loth as long as he got his liquor scot free. But how was he to quit the Seven Stars, and escape the disagreeable ceremony of first adjusting the score! This idea made him thoughtful, he knit his brows, cursed the Stars, and cocking his hat fiercely, took several turns around the room in silence. The landlord beheld this sudden transition in amazement, for Drone had been in excellent humour all the afternoon, and laughed vociferously at every joke mine host had perpetrated. The corporal continued pacing the room, and occasionally muttering unintelligibly, which tended to increase the amazement of the other, who believed he was planning the overthrow of the invading army at least, when Drone paused abruptly, and desired him to make out the bill, “and harkye, landlord,” continued he, “charge your own entertainment to my account, for I play the host to-day.” The landlord withdrew behind the bar to consult Cocker's Arithmetic, and Drone commenced pacing the room again, at double-quick time. His moody humour increased, and more than once did mine host raise his eyes from his paper, in amazement at the rapid movements of his guest, who suddenly left the room, and afforded him an opportunity of working out his abstruse calculation without interruption. This was quite a relief to him of the Seven Stars, and in the space of ten minutes, he was prepared for that most disagreeable part of an entertainment, the presentation of the reckoning, but as the corporal never had any stomach for such a dessert, he bethought him that he had better take a ride first, by way of sharpening his appetite. There was nothing in life that he abhorred like a tavern bill, and frequently did he protest against the selfish custom that tended to put the best natured man out of humour, and render him uncomfortable. He of the Seven Stars sat long, in expectation of his return, but though he had sat until his Stars had vanished, he would not have caught a glimpse of the corporal again. Growing impatient he went out to the stable, when the absence of the corporal's horse let him into a secret, and searching further, he discovered that Drone in his hurry had mistaken the best bridle of mine host for his own, which he charitably attributed to an absence of mind occasioned by the weight of public affairs, and he now considered his guest a greater man than ever. A pompous bearing is a jewel beyond price, for even paste may pass for a diamond with the unskilful lapidary. The storm was gathering fast, and mountains of dense clouds arose like contending armies above the western horizon. They moved on gloomily in solid phalanx, column after column, until the whole western sky was covered to the zenith, and the armament appeared arrayed, ready for the conflict. Drone, as he beheld the imposing spectacle, lost but little time in admiration, but pushed his horse to the top of his speed, which was a peculiar gait between a shamble and a gallop, for the corporal had two objects in view, and luckily for him they went hand in hand together— the first was to escape from the storm, and the other from the host of the Seven Stars. Never were the rib-displaying sides of the corporal's garran so belaboured with crab-tree cudgel, nor had the valiant corporal for many a day performed such a task of thrashing as upon this memorable occasion. He laboured with a zeal that became a better cause. Many a glance did he turn towards the threatening clouds, thence his eye would descend to the road he had traversed, and the third motion was a dexterous flourish of the crab-tree cudgel, which the poor beast acknowledged by a toss of the head and a switch or two of the tail, and there was an end of it. The longest lane must have an end, says the proverb, and so it was with the corporal's journey, notwithstanding its discouraging aspect. In the course of an hour his eyes were greeted with the welcome sight of the Crooked Billet swinging in the wind that piped mournfully. Night was closing in, the rain had commenced falling, and it froze as it fell; the corporal was not well equipt for travelling in such a night, and he already enjoyed in anticipation the comforts of Nicholas's bar-room. Even the president of a Temperance Society, under similar circumstances would acknowledge that some good might come out of Nazareth. The corporal rode under the shed, and having secured his horse, entered the Crooked Billet with as little ceremony as though he had been confident of a cordial welcome. Nicholas was alone, seated at the fire, musing, or rather seeming to muse, for the mind is seldom so inactive as when wrapped in what is commonly called a brownstudy. “Here you are, Nicholas, my boy,” exclaimed the corporal, as he entered, “as snug as a thief in a mill. Let the storm pour, here we may laugh and be merry, and though it knock until the morning, we will bar the door, and it shall not enter, for we look not for such watery guests at the Crooked Billet, ha! Nicholas!” “Some rum ones enter without knocking;” replied the bruiser, in a surly tone, without rising from his seat. “Such are always welcome at an inn,” replied the corporal. “Who is it fills your bar with rosy liquor but the rum ones? Who is it makes your hearth blaze so cheerfully but the rum ones? Who is it makes your table groan with plenty, albeit they consume but little? why the rum ones. And let me tell you, Nicholas, if it were not for the pimple-faced jolly dogs, you might lay the axe to your sign-post, and warm yourself with it before spring.” “Humph!” grunted Nicholas, without turning his face from the fire, and the corporal began to question his welcome. But he was a man not easily to be driven from a bar-room, and believing that if he could only get Nicholas into conversation, he would succeed in talking him out of his ill humour, and thus prevent a summary ejectment, he continued— “Have you heard the news, old boy? Strange events have transpired since I last tasted your Geneva. By the beard of Aaron, 'tis passing all belief. Jurian Hartfield—you know the boy—has been charged with being in British pay. A spy, Nicholas! a traitor to his country! think of that. Patriotism has become nothing more than a word to gull the credulous, and we who honestly contend for freedom shall have our lives bartered by those in whom we repose the greatest confidence.” “Is that all?” said Nicholas. “The boy has been placed under arrest, and I fear it will go hard with him on his trial, for the evidence is as clear as noon day.” “That's his affair, not mine.” “But what is most remarkable,” continued Drone, “the principal witness against him is his own mother, who it was denounced him.” “Is Alice Grey his mother?” demanded Nicholas. “So it is said, but she was not aware of the fact until after the accusation was made. But how is it that you are acquainted with the circumstances already?” “That's my business, not yours.” “Zounds! Nick, you are as crusty as if you had lived in a bake-oven all your days.” “That's my affair. But if you do not wish to be benighted, it is time for you to be gone.” “Be gone! benighted!—Why zounds! Nick, it is as dark as the devil already.” “That's your affair, not mine.” “Only look to the west and behold what a storm is brewing; such a one as would have drowned all the frogs and locusts that curst the kingdom of Pharaoh, and can you have the bowels to drive me out to abide its fury?” “Humph!” ejaculated Nicholas, and pointed to the door. “Be not so laconic, but speak out like a host of hospitality.” “You came uninvited, and even so depart,” said Nicholas. “You are jesting! By the beard of Aaron, you cannot be in earnest!” The scowl on the dark countenance of Nicholas became more lowering, but the corporal continued— “You were always a wag, Nick, a merry wag;” the shaggy eyebrows of mine host pursed closer together; “and as I have made a vow never to leave your house with a dry lip, I will even scent my way to your jug of Geneva.” This was accompanied by a short chuckling laugh, and he made a move towards the bar; Nicholas rose, remained stationary, and without speaking, waved his right hand towards the door. His fist was clenched; the corporal hesitated; he looked in the landlord's countenance, and beheld a more threatening storm gathering there, than that without; Nicholas advanced one step; the corporal retreated towards the door; he advanced a second; the corporal seized the wooden latch, and kept his eyes fixed on the threatening attitude of the other, and while in this position the door was violently pushed open; the corporal staggered beneath the shock, and in stalked Paul Gordon. In an instant Drone vanished, slammed the door after him, and left the worthies alone. “The poor corporal,” exclaimed Nicholas, laughing, “was loth to turn out until you turned in, but faith, he was not long in making up his mind on your appearance.” “It is an ugly night, Nicholas,” replied Paul, “for either man or beast to be abroad. Are we alone?” “Quite alone.” “Then this night's campaign does not promise to be a very profitable one. I have taken but one purse from a committee of safety man, who was travelling to the west. He had lodged it in his bosom, next his heart, and from his care I supposed I had taken a prize, but on opening it, I found it crammed with continental paper. What rubbish man will lay next his heart, Nicholas!” “Damned rubbish, indeed,” responded mine host of the Billet. “The business I spoke to you about, Nicholas, is in a fair train, and it will be necessary for you in a few days to go to the Forge, and give your evidence against the accused. Have you thought well upon the story you are to tell? Look out that there be no flaws in it, for if we succeed the reward will be liberal, and all in gold. Think of that, Nicholas.” “I have, and if I don't make out a plain case, they will have very little faith in a kiss on a book, I promise you. I may swear with a safe conscience, for it will be all true, you know; and though I did not see the transaction myself, you will vouch for it, and that's the same thing in the end.” “I will vouch for every word,” replied Paul, “and would give my evidence myself, could it be done with safety, but I don't think it would be prudent for me at present to appear before an American court martial.” “I don't think it would,” said Nicholas. “But that's no reason why the guilty should escape punishment,” said Paul. “Certainly not,” replied Nicholas, “and I think it a virtue to strain a point on such an occasion.” “Especially if you be well paid for it,” said Paul. “Virtue should always be rewarded,” said Nicholas, “otherwise vice would be the most profitable pursuit, and that should never be the case in a moral community.” “You speak like a preacher.” “It is necessary for us to be quick on the trigger,” continued Nicholas, “for Jurian is already in limbo, and his business will doubtless be settled speedily. Some folk complain of the law's delay, but I am not of the number.” He chuckled dryly as he concluded. “Jurian already apprehended!” exclaimed Paul; “where heard you this?” “From the corporal, who also brought a stranger piece of news?” “What news?” “The boy turns out to be Alice Grey's son.” “Alice Grey's son! Impossible.” “True! The mother has condemned her own son VOL. II.—13 to the scaffold. A strange world, and strange things come to pass in it!” “Strange, indeed! Poor Miriam!” “And as we cannot hope to have the benefit of the old woman's testimony in the present case, we must look around for another witness; for possibly my story may require bolstering.” “True; another shall be found.” “But don't you think that a good round sum might still tempt the old woman?” “You know her not. Though the earth were piled to the heavens with gold, it would not tempt her.” “It is astonishing how very silly some people are!” ejaculated Nicholas. “Well, what's to be done?” “Leave that to me. Jurian her son! Bring me some liquor, Nicholas, and look out and tell me whether the storm has abated.” He placed a bottle before Paul, and went to the door. “It is confounded dark and cold,” said Nicholas, “but it does not rain as fast as when you entered.” “It is well. Sit down, old boy, and let us drink success to our enterprise. I have not many moments to stay.” “You had better make a night of it.” “No; time presses, and I must see Madge, and prepare her for the occasion. I will call here as I return to-morrow.” “Then all will be snug; for there is not a clearer witness in a nice case in the whole county than that same Madge.” By the time our worthies had finished the bottle, the storm had abated its fury, and Paul remounted and pursued his way towards the cottage of Madge Haines, while Nicholas barred his door and retired to bed, and commenced weaving his chain of testimony against Jurian.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. Heart of my body, here's a coil indeed, With your jealous humours. —Cynthia's Revels. Paul Gordon had of late become more remiss in his attentions to Mistress Haines, who did not fail to upbraid him with his faithlessness in order to reclaim him to his allegiance; but it is the decided opinion of Socrates, that when the blandishments of love cease to have an influence, it is in vain to attempt to bully a man into affection. Mistress Haines, however, differed from the philosopher, and was unwilling to consider the point as fully settled: accordingly, the perjured Paul, when on his amorous visits, instead of meeting with such a reception as he had reason to expect from a disciple of the sea-froth goddess, was obliged to buckle on his armour and withstand the sharp encounter of an Achilles in petticoats. This for a short time Paul considered the very spice of life, but as it daily became more highly seasoned, he found it rather unpalatable, and felt uncomfortable after partaking of the repast. In proportion as his visits became less frequent, Madge seasoned the entertainment, which finally became so pungent, that even the fireproof palate of Paul could not bear it; and Mistress Haines found too late that man is faithless, and woman is born to trouble as the sparks fly from them. On the night to which we have brought our narrative, Madge, while ruminating alone in her cottage, listening to the pelting storm, and watching the blaze which occasionally arose from the embers, mouldering in the huge fireplace, and after playing for a few moments about the surface of the ashes, and casting fantastic shadows over the smoke-dried room, would go out and leave all in total darkness—the pensive damsel was disturbed by a gentle tap at the door, which at first was scarcely audible, owing to the continued pattering of the rain upon the roof of the cottage. The knock was repeated and the door was opened, when Miriam Grey entered, drenched with rain and nearly fainting with fatigue. She sunk exhausted upon a seat which stood beside the door, and it was some moments before she recovered sufficient strength to apologise for the unceremonious intrusion. When she raised her head her countenance was pale and melancholy, and her eyes were red with weeping, and tears were still trickling from them— “I hope you will excuse the liberty I have taken,” she said, “but the night is a frightful one, and I feel I have already gone beyond my strength.” “You are welcome to my poor hovel,” replied Madge, “for the night is too stormy for any christian soul to be abroad, much less a feeble woman. Come, draw your stool to the hearth while I rake the coals together.” “The blessings of heaven be on you: I thought I should have perished in the woods this night, but your charity has saved me.” Madge drew the coals together, and threw some light wood upon them, which speedily blazed up. “Come, you are shivering with cold; draw up to the fire and warm yourself. Doubt not your welcome.” Miriam rose, but reseated herself immediately, being unable to walk to the fire. Madge observed her distress, and said— “You appear quite overcome with fatigue.” “I am, indeed,” replied the other faintly. “Lean on me; poor soul, how pale she looks, and how feeble.” With the assistance of Madge, the sick woman supported herself to the fire, and sunk upon a stool which the other had placed in the corner to receive her. “Thank you, thank you, heaven's blessing be on you,” said Miriam, with a feeble and faltering voice. “Your cloak is dripping with rain: take it off, and I will hang it behind the door to dry.” “You are kind, but I fear I am troublesome.” “Don't think of it. Come, give me your cloak, for if you sit longer in your wet clothes, you will take your death of cold.” Miriam untied her cloak and handed it to the other, who scrutinized her figure as if she recollected having seen her before. “Which way are you travelling?” “To Lancaster; but I fear I shall never reach it.” “It is a long journey for a lone woman and a young one; and you are already worn down with fatigue. Have you any friends in the place you are going to?” “Friends! alas! I have none on earth!” replied Miriam, and began weeping. “So young, and so forlorn! Where do you intend sleeping to-night?” “I know not; in my grave, if I am turned from your door. But I care not, though it be in the grave.” “Poor wretch! I am not so hard-hearted; my own sufferings have taught me to feel for others. Would you have any thing to eat?” “Nothing: rest is all I require, for I feel very faint.” The door now opened, and Paul Gordon entered. He shook the rain from his broad brimmed hat, which he hung upon a peg behind the door; and as he approached the blazing hearth, Miriam raised her languid head, and immediately shrunk back with horror, 13* as she recognised in his countenance the features of her persecutor Jones—though his Quaker apparel was well calculated to deceive a less scrutinizing eye. She involuntarily articulated his name, and averted her face, and though she spoke almost inaudibly, the name fell distinctly upon the watchful ear of the jealous and neglected Madge. Paul, as he stood spreading his large form before the cheerful blaze of the fire, pretended not to recognise in the miserable being who sat trembling beside him, the once lovely and innocent object of his persecution. He said, in a careless tone— “A rough night this, stranger, to be abroad, and I thank Fortune that I have got under cover at last.” Miriam made no reply, for the well known tones of his voice only served to increase her terror and agitation; and as Paul himself did not feel altogether unconcerned at her presence, a profound silence prevailed for some moments. After having warmed himself, he said— “It is growing late, and my ride through the storm has chilled and wearied me, so good night to both; I will go to bed.” He entered the adjoining room, but on closing the door he cast a look upon the unfortunate wanderer, which did not escape the notice of his Dulcinea, who followed him with a light. “So; you are acquainted with this trull too it seems,” said Madge, after a pause, which was spent in working herself into a passion. “I have seen the poor girl before,” replied our knight of the stirrup. “And will see her again?” “Doubtless!” “But never under this roof.” “Then she will have to be very expeditious in departing,” replied Paul. “And so she shall: for out she goes this instant.” “No; she shall not.” “Who will prevent it?” “Your heart.” “Pshaw! my heart! You make us devils, and yet expect to find us angles. My heart!” “If your's wont, mine will.” “Your's! ha! ha! ha! a highwayman preaching mercy and charity. What has the Devil to do with the pater-noster?” “Nothing, that I know of,” said Paul, gravely. “Or you with morality and a feeling heart?” “Humph! I can't boast much of either.” “Then out she goes.” “No; that's a mistake, as I have already said.” “Am I the mistress of this miserable hovel or not?” “You are.” “Then I will do as I please here.” “Not always.” “Why not?” “Because I am master of both you and the miserable hovel,” replied the other sternly. During this dialogue Paul had seated himself upon the foot of the bed, and was proceeding leisurely to undress himself. His last remark completely silenced the enraged woman, who, however, gave him a glance which superseded the necessity of wasting words. Paul observed it, and having read that book often, was at no loss to understand its meaning: he therefore thought it prudent to allay the storm while brewing, rather than encounter it in its fury. He proceeded in a more conciliating tone— “Man seldom becomes so debased, as to be wholly deprived of the feelings of humanity.” “True.” “And woman, as long as the milk of human kindness flows from her bosom, no matter how great the account between heaven and herself, is an idol for man to worship.” “Very fine: but what's that to me?” “It goes to prove that I still love you, for I know you have a feeling heart.” “Pshaw! come round to the point. Who is this wench?” “Miriam Grey.” “I have heard of her. And you would have her stay here to-night?” “She appears feeble and sick; and might perish, if turned out to wander in the storm.” “Well; her death would not be at my door.” “No; but certainly on your conscience.” “Conscience, mercy, and charity!” exclaimed Madge, with a sneer;” the man is better calculated for the pulpit than the highway. Well; you shall be obeyed; I will make her a bed in the adjoining room by the fire.” “Right, my brave girl! Faith, I love you now better than ever, for woman never looks so much like an angel as when administering to the wants of a fellow being.” There was but little of the angel in the appearance of Madge, or painters have flattered the sublimated race outrageously; still, she believed there was both justice and sincerity in the remark of Paul. “You have a flattering tongue,” said she, “and if you please to wheedle, I can refuse you nothing.” “So, the storm has fortunately gone by,” said our hero to himself, as Madge entered the adjoining room to prepare a bed for the sick woman; but Paul, with all his observation, had not yet discovered that usually a dead calm prevails throughout nature, immediately preceding the most violent tempest. Madge rebuilt the fire upon the hearth, and prepared a bed for the unhappy girl, who appeared to be too much engrossed with her own feelings to attend to the movements of her hostess. The bed being finished, Madge wished her `good night,' and withdrew into her own room and assumed a smile which was as welcome to Paul as the face of the sun to the mariner, who, from the gathering clouds, had prepared himself to encounter a war of the elements. It was broad daylight the following morning when our hero awoke, and after stretching himself, he started up in the bed and exclaimed, “Zounds, Madge, I have overslept myself,” but as no answer was returned, he looked around, and discovered that his fair partner was not quite as much of a sluggard as himself. She had already arisen and left the room. Paul dressed himself, and on entering the room in which Miriam had slept, discovered that she also had disappeared. He called aloud, but no answer was returned. He opened the door, but there was no sign of either of the fugitives. “What the Devil is the meaning of all this,” said Paul to himself, as he took a seat, and began to cogitate, in hopes of resolving the mystery; but the more he thought, the more he became perplexed, and he finally abandoned it in despair, and exclaimed, “I might as well attempt to find out the longitude as the motive of a woman's actions: so if she has gone, even let her go, and the Devil go with her, for he has got his due, and I am fairly rid of a termagant.” Such is the plastic and accommodating nature of the human mind, that man will become reconciled to any affliction or privation which heaven in its wisdom may deem proper to impose; and to such an extent has this praiseworthy resignation been carried in modern times, that it is not unusual to see a tender husband following his beloved wife to the grave with cheerfulness; and a young widow, turning to her dower to console herself for the loss of her aged spouse; a brother beholding, with christianlike calmness, the ruin of a brother; and a dutiful son, in the fulness of his grief, dancing with all his might, like the man after God's own heart, upon the tomb of his wealthy parent. Paul had no sooner become reconciled to his loss than he was under the necessity of calling upon his philosophy again, to aid him in a more arduous trial. He had resolved to take his final departure from the spot, and forget Mistress Haines forever; but at the moment he rose to put this resolution into execution she entered, with her skinny face crimpled into what she considered an engaging smile, but it must be admitted, that those who are familiar alone with the laughing dimples of a rosy-cheeked Hebe, would have been at a loss to comprehend the peculiar expression of Madge's countenance. Paul looked rather abashed at this ill-timed apparition, for his mind fell headlong, as it were from a pinnacle to a bottomless pit, and he would not have felt half as foolish had he been taken in the act of picking a pocket. He was prepared for her loss, but not for her recovery, and in evident confusion he stammered out— “You are stirring early, mistress; what business could have taken you abroad at this hour of the morning?” “I have been to the next neighbour's, to provide a breakfast for you,” replied Madge. “Considerate girl! Well, how have you succeeded?” “I will not speak as to the quality of the fare, but you will have enough to digest, I warrant you,” she replied, at the same time placing the half consumed brands which lay promiscuously about the hearth together. “Right,” exclaimed Paul, “homely fare is the best suited to a wholesome stomach; but be stirring, the sun is high, and I should have been on the road at least an hour ago.” “You are always impatient to leave me, in spite of all I can do to detain you.” “No, on my life, sweet Madge, but pleasure you know must give place to business, or I would not be absent a moment from this delightful spot.” “If so, you will not deny me the pleasure of your company half an hour longer?” “Certainly not, certainly not,” said Gordon, at the same time resolving that it should be the last favour she should have an opportunity of requesting of him. He was anxious to know what had become of Miriam, but feared to broach the subject. “You are already equipped for starting; pray, put down your arms, for it appears as if you begrudged me the few moments you stay with me.” “You shall be gratified every way,” replied Paul, taking off the belt by which his pistols were secured, and laying the weapons upon the table. “I will put them out of sight, for they only serve to remind me that I am to lose you in a few moments,” said Madge, and carried them into the adjoining room. “How fond the hussy is of me,” said Paul to himself; and he felt an unusual degree of self-importance, as the idea came across his mind. “How fond the hussy is of me.” It is a nice point, and still unsettled, whether man or woman is possessed of the greater portion of vanity. Madge immediately returned, and standing behind the chair upon which Paul was seated, began to fondle upon him. “You are loving, you rogue; you are loving.” “What fools we women are for our pains,” said Madge, “one half the trouble that we take to secure an old lover would obtain us twenty new ones.” This was accompanied by a kiss, and our hero turned up the whites of his eyes; put on a gracious smile, and endeavoured to look as fascinating as a man could possibly look in such a dilemma. His arms were suspended over the back of the chair upon which he was seated, and his hands were twined within each other. Madge slyly slipped a noose over both hands while in this position,— “What frolic are you about?” cried Paul, gaily, as she drew the cord tight around his wrists. “As I have lost all hold upon you,” replied Madge, laughing, “I have taken the surest mode of securing you for the future.” “A merry joke, faith; a merry joke; but, zounds, you hurt my wrists; don't draw the cord so tight, my angel. Damn it, I say, don't draw the cord so tight.” “You are surely jesting,” said the other, “you can release yourself from these fetters as easily as you have from mine.” “For all that, sweet Madge, devil a peg can I stir.” “Are you quite sure of that?” “As sure as I am my name is Paul Gordon.” “Then I will call some one to your assistance. Hallo! the lion's in the toil.” The door was burst open, and three or four countrymen rushed in, armed with guns, and in their rear the valiant corporal Drone, flourishing his rusty sword. “Down with the Philistine,” cried the corporal; “shoot him; strike, and spare not.” The guns were instantly presented towards the breast of the highwayman, who attempted in vain to rise, as the false Delilah exercised all her strength to keep him stationary. “Hold!” cried his betrayer, “spare his life, he is perfectly secure.” “Sampson has lost all his hair,” cried the corporal, “then let me at him.” “Gadfly, begone! Traitress, let go your hold that I may tread him out.” Gordon made a violent exertion to rise, and sprang to his feet, his hands still secured behind him. The corporal slunk back, not emulous of being the first to encounter his fury, should he by possibility regain his freedom; but in his retreat he called loudly upon the others to advance and secure him. Paul rushed towards the adjoining room. “Do not let him enter there,” cried Madge, “or he will escape,” saying which, she threw her gaunt figure between him and the door. “Out of the way, you treacherous hag, or I will trample your lights out,” shouted Paul. He pressed upon her, a struggle ensued, and the woman in order to escape his fury darted into the adjoining room, but before she could close the door, Paul followed and dashed it to after him. The next moment the falling of a heavy bar was heard, and the countrymen on trying the door found it secured. “Cowards!” cried the corporal, “you have suffered him to escape. Had I attempted to take him alone this would not have happened. But I am rightly served. This comes of trusting to others to do what I could have done myself,” saying which, he strutted about the room in as great a huff as did a certain distinguished character, who has been likened unto `a roaring lion,' on a memorable occasion. “Help, help!” cried the woman from within, “or he will murder me.” “Break open the door,” shouted the corporal, and they battered against it with the butts of their guns, while Madge continued to cry for assistance. “Run round the house,” cried the corporal, “and if he will not surrender, shoot him through the window.” Two were about to obey this order, when they were arrested by the report of a pistol in the adjoining room, which was succeeded by a heavy fall upon the floor. “He has murdered the woman,” cried the corporal. “Down with the door, I say.” The bar across the door was now raised, the door flew open, and Madge came forth, her hair and apparel in great disorder, that indicated the violence of the struggle she had encountered. In her left hand she held Paul's belt with a pistol in it, and in the other the remaining pistol, which was still reeking from the recent discharge. The countrymen rushed into the room, and found Paul upon the floor. He had succeeded VOL. II.—14 in raising himself upon his knees, and was about springing to his feet as they entered, but they pointed the muzzles of their guns to his broad and bloody chest, and he remained in that attitude without attempting to rise. His hands were still bound behind him. “Fire,” cried Paul, “if you please;” and he fixed his unwavering eyes fiercely upon his captors. “Shoot him down,” cried the corporal, peeping in at the door. “Spare his life,” cried Madge, approaching, “you can secure him now.” “Hell-cat, begone!” shouted Paul, and sprung to his feet. Madge retreated, and the corporal withdrew his head. “Surrender, or we fire,” cried one of the countrymen. “Then fire, for that were a more welcome death than upon the gibbet.” “Spare his life,” repeated Madge, “for what have you to fear from a wounded man with his hands tied?” “The devil's dam has turned oracle,” said Paul, in bitter irony; “what have you to fear from one whom a woman mastered?” They laid hold of him, and he suffered himself to be secured without further resistance. They now opened his bosom to examine the state of his wound, and discovered that the ball had passed through the fleshy part of the right breast, and grazed the right arm near the shoulder. “The wound is not fatal, I hope,” said Madge. “Well aimed, devil, but not fatal,” replied Paul. “Come, cover up the scratch the hell-cat gave me, and let us begone.” “Paul, you know I would not have fired, had it not been to save my life,” said Madge, in a penitent tone. “And that alone saved it,” replied Paul; “but for that, you should not have triumphed in your treachery,” The corporal, perceiving that there was now no danger, ventured to come forward, and after reconnoitring the captive for some time, was amazed on recognizing in the terror of the country his quondam acquaintance Jones. He gazed in mute astonishment, with eyes and mouth both open, and seemed to question the evidence of his own senses, but when fully satisfied that it was no illusion, he exclaimed— “Damn it, Jones, and is it you after all who have keen kicking up such a confounded dust that no man could travel the highway with comfort! But give us your hand, old boy—I am heartily glad to see you, for months have elapsed since we have had a social cup together. Give us your hand.” Drone took him familiarly by the hand, and he of whom the whole neighbourhood had for months stood in awe, was now divested of his terrors even in the eyes of the cowardly corporal. “By the beard of Aaron,” continued Drone, “if I had but known that honest Jones was the bugbear all this while, I should have settled the hash long ago.” Truly has it been said, that no man is a hero to his valet de chambre. The corporal took Paul's belt from the woman, and buckling it around his waist, strutted fiercely about the room, issuing his orders to the countrymen, and occasionally exclaiming, “If I had but known that this fearless desperado had been no other than my pot-companion Jones, I should have settled his business in short order.” Even Paul smiled at the consequential airs of the corporal, as he strutted about in Ephraim's plain coat, begirt with the highwayman's belt and pistols. To complete the anomaly, a long sword was hanging by his side, and portions of his tattered rifle shirt were seen beneath his anti-warlike apparel. They finally concluded to lodge the prisoner in Chester county jail, and they left the cottage with that intent, the corporal walking beside Paul, and chatting familiarly with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. That form of seraph sweetness, where the eye enraptur'd gazed, Is a piteous wreck in its loveliness, for the lost one's brain is crazed. Twere better she were sleeping, within the silent tomb; Oh, never more to her frenzied eye, the flowers of life shall bloom. Wetmore. The morn arose brightly after the storm, and the elements that had contended like fiends during the gloom of night, now smiled as sweetly as a wearied child. The sky was clear, the sun was bright, and the bracing north wind was scarcely audible as it played among the ice-covered groves and swept over the encrusted plains. Paul's cottage was surrounded by a wood, through which there ran a horse-path leading to the Lancaster road. Along this path the corporal, mounted upon Paul's horse, directed the steps of the prisoner, who was guarded by the two stoutest of the countrymen, and the others with Madge followed promiscuously in the rear. Drone chattered familiarly with Paul, and reminded him of his inhospitable reception the preceding night at the Crooked Billet, and concluded by protesting that if he had only known his man, the business should have been settled on the spot. Paul, however, made no reply to the boasting corporal—not even by a look, or a contemptuous curl of the lip, but he moved on gloomily, with his eyes fixed upon the path along which he travelled. They were still in sight of the cottage, when Madge, who had deviated slightly from the path, uttered an exclamation of horror, upon which the corporal commanded the guards to halt, and then he rode to the spot where the woman stood in violent agitation, and beheld a spectacle calculated to make even his uncouth feelings shudder. At the root of a lofty oak lay the dead body of a new-born babe, half covered with fallen leaves and snow. They had scarcely recovered from the first shock occasioned by this discovery, when the figure of a female was seen, at a short distance, slowly moving through the wood, as if she wished to escape observation. One of the countrymen went in pursuit of her, and as he approached, her feet refused their office, and she fell to the ground, exclaiming— “Have mercy! I did not murder it; I did not murder it!” The countryman seized hold of her. “O! whither would you take me! For pity's sake do not drag me so. I tell you the little innocent lives yet. It was very cold, and I feared that it would freeze to death, and so I covered it to keep it warm. Come with me, and I will show you where it is sleeping sweetly.” “You must answer this before a judge of the court,” cried the countryman. “Stand up, you baggage.” “Alas! I am too weak to stand, but I will crawl to the spot where the cherub sleeps. This way; follow me, but tread lightly, lest you break its slumbers. This way; this way.” “Stand up, I say,” repeated the countryman, and dragged her to her feet. She stood for a few moments, and then sunk to the earth again. It is a trait in human nature, that as soon as a fellow mortal is accused of a crime, to consider him beyond the pale of humanity, and deserving of all the indignity and odium attendant upon a full and open conviction of guilt. The 14* world usually prejudges and condemns, without going to the trouble to distinguish the accused from the criminal, and too frequently the most unfounded charge proves sufficiently venomous to poison the public mind, and crush the brightest reputation. Corporal Drone by this time came up, and recognising Miriam, interceded in her behalf, and rescued her from the insults of the countryman. The remainder of the party drew nigh from motives of curiosity, and Gordon could not conceal his emotion as he rivited his dark gray eyes upon the miserable being before him. His feelings did not escape the notice of the jealous Madge, who exclaimed scornfully, and with an air of triumph— “There is your dirty trull: why don't you go comfort her now? And is this the wicked drab that I was slighted for? Heaven mend the taste of some people, but dirt will mix with dirt, in spite of every thing.” “Peace! thou foul-mouthed hag,” cried Paul, “for her greatest crimes had less of guilt in them than your brightest virtues; but woman cannot feel compassion for the fallen of her own sex.” “But you have a large share of compassion for the whole of us, it seems,” returned the other, scornfully; “well, it comes in good time, for you stand in need of compassion yourself at present.” Our knight of the post turned from her, with all the dignity that a gentleman of his nice feelings could call to his aid under such embarrassing circumstances. The corporal raised the sick woman from the ground; she made two or three steps, but unable to support herself, sunk exhausted in his arms, and scarcely articulated— “For mercy's sake, let me lie down and die: I wish to die, for I am no longer fit to live. But take care of the little babe when I am gone, for it is a sweet babe.” “Make a litter of saplings,” said Paul, “upon which you can carry her to my old friend, Ephraim Horn's house, about a mile from this.” One of the countrymen was about returning to Gordon's cottage to get an axe, for the purpose of making the litter, when Paul added, “Bring a few blankets with you, for the poor girl's situation requires every tenderness.” “Very fine, upon my life! but the devil a piece of blanket shall go out of my house,” exclaimed Madge, in a shrill key, at the same time making use of appropriate gesticulation. “You will let me have covering for my babe,” said Miriam, in a supplicating tone. “I care not for myself—I can bear the cold, but the poor little innocent, I fear, may take harm.” “Bring the blankets, I say,” repeated Paul, “and do you hear, pillows too, for they will be needed.” “How kind and considerate!” said Miriam. “I will bring the babe to thank you. He lies sleeping at the foot of yon tree. I covered him up warm, lest the cold should reach him. Let us steal softly there, and see how sweetly he sleeps.” Madge again protested against converting her property to such a use, until the corporal interfered with the loud voice and strong arm of authority, when her objections were silenced, and the countryman immediately procured all that had been called for. It is remarkable, how much more imperative the voice of authority is than that of mercy. The litter was speedily made, and the unhappy girl, with the dead body of her child, were placed upon it, and they slowly commenced their march towards the residence of Ephraim Horn. Miriam nustled the child in her bosom, and covered it up. “How cold it is!” she said. “Poor little sufferer! it chills me to the very heart, but I will warm it yet.” She sang a lullaby, and hugging the child closer to her bosom, rocked her body as if she designed to put it to sleep. A few minutes after, she uncovered her bosom, and held the child to it. “What are you doing?” said Madge, who was walking beside the litter, and had observed her movements for some time; “Cover yourself, or you will take your death of cold.” “The poor thing must be fed,” said Miriam, “but it is strange it will not take the breast.” “Cover yourself,” said Madge, whose rugged feelings were touched. “Cover yourself,” she repeated, and threw the blanket over her bosom. “You doubtless are a mother,” said Miriam. “Can you tell why the child refuses the breast.” Ephraim was a substantial farmer; his large stone house and outbuildings indicated the wealth of their possessor, and the comforts of those who resided within their walls: but thick walls, though they keep out the weather and unwelcome visiters, do not unfrequently exclude humanity, and all compassion for the sufferings of others. As the corporal and his company approached the house, through a long avenue of lofty trees, he ejaculated— “This is comfortable! my ideas, to a hair, on the subject of domestic happiness, and when my country shall no longer require my services, I shall seat myself down like friend Ephraim here, and enjoy the remnant of a life of successful enterprise.” The corporal moved on in silence, big with the conceit of his importance, until he arrived under the porch of the mansion, when he paused for a moment, and taking a survey of the premises, said— “Well, Paul is right; this is the place to obtain the necessary relief for that suffering woman;” and accordingly he knocked at the door with rather more authority than wisdom. Having waited a few minutes and no answer being returned, he repeated his summons with redoubled vigour, determined to make himself heard; and Ephraim shortly after appeared, unlocked the door, passed through, and closed it after him. “Well, friend, thee makes a great deal of unnecessary noise; what is thy business with me?” “Charity,” replied the corporal, pointing at the litter. Ephraim raised his eyes, paused for a moment, and then said— “Thee should have gone to the door the other side of the house, and not have put me to all this trouble for nothing.” “I have knocked at the wrong door, sure enough,” thought the corporal; and then resuming his confidence, proceeded—“as this young woman is sorely afflicted, I came to ask of you some means of conveyance.” “And where would thee take her to, friend?” “It behoves us to take her to prison,” replied the corporal. “Then it behoves the law to provide a mode of conveyance,” said Ephraim, gravely. “You are right,” answered the corporal, “but christian charity should be extended by the mightiest of mankind, even to the most fallen of God's creatures.” “Charity begins at home,” responded Ephraim. “And your's is likely to remain there,” said Gordon, taking a step or two from the crowd, towards Ephraim, who shrunk back in dismay at his approach. “Well, friend Horn,” continued the corporal, “as you have refused to grant me a trifling favour, I have a small demand to make as a right. Here is your advertisement offering a reward of five pounds, hard money, for the apprehension of Paul Gordon; and here, in my custody, you behold that alarming personage.” Saying which, he took the advertisement from his pocket and commenced reading it. “What thee says is all very true,” replied Ephraim, coolly: “but before I pay the reward Paul must be prosecuted to conviction.” The corporal's countenance suddenly fell from the height of expectation to the depth of disappointment, and he remained gazing at the quaker in silent astonishment. By this time Horn's wife had come to the door; a tallow-faced personage, with a clean long-eared cap, who made up in rotundity her deficiency in longitude. “Ephraim, what is it these people would have?” inquired his wife, taking a survey of the company; and on being informed she approached the litter, where the wretched Miriam lay, almost unconscious of what was passing around her. “As I live, it is the impure one we cast from our house but yesterday:—good friends begone; her presence is painful and offensive to the eyes of the undefiled.” “Then afford us the means of conveying her out of your sight,” replied the corporal. “Hence, thou reviler,” cried Ephraim, “for it is written, `the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.”' “Well, we wish to get out of your congregation as soon as possible,” observed the pertinacious Drone. “He revileth, yea, verily, and his words are abomination to my ears,” exclaimed the fat wife of lean Ephraim. “The devil they are; your eyes are offended with the sight of wretchedness; and your ears abominate a petition of charity:—which way are you travelling; up or down, old lady?” “He is one of the scornful, Ephraim, come in and hearken not to his voice; for like the blighted willows on the banks of the Jordan”— “I am not a blighted willow, and I was never on the banks of the Jordan in my life.” “On which the children of Israel hung their harps and wept,” continued the old lady, with a strong nasal twang. “This is nothing to the purpose,” interrupted the corporal; “will you lend me a conveyance, or will you not?” “We will praise the Lord, for he hath dealt bountifully with us,” continued Mrs. Horn, “but the good things of this world are for the righteous, and not the unclean.” “Leave off canting, and give a plain answer, yes or no.” “No,” said Ephraim, and turned on his heel. “We will not lend our weakness to strengthen the enemies of the Lord,” canted forth his wife, and followed his example. “Then go in,” cried the corporal, “and worship Dagon and the golden calf.” “Thou art a sinful reviler.” “Moses and mammon; Aaron and his rod.” “Hear how he blasphemes; verily his voice offendeth mine ear.” “The locusts of Egypt; the frogs and the bullrushes.” “Verily, Satan moveth his lips.” “Jephthah and his daughter; Sampson and the Philistines.” “We will shun the presence of the scoffer.” “Balaam and his ass; Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.” The corporal pursued Ephraim and his wife with a shower of words until they closed the door in his face; he then took a survey of the house from the roof to the foundation, and said— “High walls keep out charity, and may your niggardly souls have a fine crop of grass before your inhospitable doors.” They took up the litter again, and proceeded to a farm house about half a mile distant. As Miriam was too unwell to be removed she was left there to recover strength, and the corporal proceeded with Paul to prison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. — There she lies, The daughter of affliction! whelm'd with woes So vast, humanity trembles to think her Of its own species. Hecuba, a tragedy. Not Phœbus with his art, or all the drugs Of Thessaly can ease my grief; the sea Knows no such straight as I now labour in. A Fine Companion. In a few days Miriam was removed to the jail of Chester county, whither Gordon had been previously conveyed. She had been kindly treated at the farm house, and her mind was now restored to a full sense of her condition. There would have been relief in insanity. Towards the close of the day after her removal to prison, a horseman muffled up in a cloak, apparently more closely than the piercing wind required, rode up to the prison, dismounted, and knocked at the door. This summons was immediately succeeded by the rattling of keys and the creaking occasioned by the unbolting of bars, when the door was opened, and the turnkey demanded why he had been summoned. “A friend would speak with Miriam Grey; can you grant his request?” “It is now the hour of closing up; if you had come sooner”— “I would but speak a few words to her,” replied the stranger, “to let her know that she is not forgotten. Even that will be a solace to one afflicted as she is.” “It will, so come in,” said the jailer, “for the poor thing needs to be comforted.” The stranger entered, the door was barred after him, and he followed the jailer in silence to the room where the wretched Miriam lay, and the door being opened, he stood in the passage for a few moments contemplating the scene that it presented to his view. On a bed in one corner of the room lay the miserable girl, whose figure was scarcely visible, by the feeble light of a lamp placed on the hearth. In another corner was a small rough table, upon which stood an earthen pitcher and some broken bread. Miriam raised her head as the door opened, and on perceiving that tall lank figure of the jailer, faintly said— “Mr. Foster, is that you? It is kind, for you cannot think how weary I am of hearing no human voice!” “Here is one would speak with you,” replied the jailer, raising his lamp, the light from which fell upon the muffled figure standing behind him; Miriam caught a glimpse of it, and shrinking with fear, exclaimed— “Ah! what man is that? Why is he here? Have they sent already to drag me to trial? I am innocent— I have told you over and over again I am innocent. As God is my witness, I am no murderer.” “Be pacified,” said Foster, in a soothing tone, “you have nothing to alarm you yet.” She concealed her face in her hands, and sobbed— “O! do not take me to trial yet; spare me but this one night, for I may die before to-morrow, and they will not have to answer for my blood.” “Raise your head, Miriam, for none but friends are near you,” replied the stranger. “Friends! I have no friends! Even heaven itself has forsaken me!” The stranger approached the bed, and called her again by name. At the sound of his voice she raised VOL. II.—15 her eyes, and after gazing wildly at him for a few moments, uttered a piercing shriek, and fell senseless upon his bosom. “The surprise has overcome her,” said the stranger. “Bring the water, Foster, and bathe her temples.” The jailor brought the pitcher from the table, and the stranger bathed the pallid face of the unconscious Miriam, who slowly revived. “Miriam, Miriam, be collected—They are friends who are with you.” “That voice—I know that voice,” she faintly said, “but then it sounds so hollow! It is no longer clear and full as in former days. Speak to me again; I cannot have been deceived.” “Miriam!” “It is he! But wherefore is he here? How did he escape? And no sooner free than to rush upon ruin for my sake! Wherefore have you done this? “Silence, Miriam, we are not alone,” said Jurian in a low voice, for it was he. “Braved an ignominious death for my sake! A thing so worthless!” “Be composed—your emotion will betray me.” “A joy so unlooked for! Praise to heaven, I am not deserted yet!” “Good Foster,” said Jurian, turning to the jailor, “can you leave us together? I would speak alone with her.” “He will not refuse,” said Miriam, “for he has been so kind to me, you cannot think how kind.” “May heaven reward him!” The jailor took his lamp and withdrew, leaving the door partly open, and the room was now imperfectly lighted by the dim lamp on the hearth. The wretched pair remained silent for some moments, during which Miriam examined with interest the altered countenance of her lover. “How pale you are!” she said; “and your cheeks are hollow. That blue vein across your forehead, that once added beauty and expression to your countenance, is now swollen and painful to behold. How fearfully that dark line contrasts with the waxen hue of your skin! And your eyes too, Jurian, that once sparkled with a fire that I imagined death alone could extinguish, are now as the eyes of one that is dead.” “True, they are dead, and buried too, my Miriam,” he replied, forcing a smile, “deep sunken in my head.” “O! do not smile! what is it has wrought this fearful change?—not sorrow for me, I hope. Let me not believe that I have done this. Cease to think of me, Jurian, or if you needs must think, only remember me as I was, and not as I am. That thought will not bring you pain.” “They are united, Miriam, by a link never to be broken.” “This is madness! What comfort will it afford me to know that you are wretched? It is enough for one to suffer, and if there be any virtue in penitence, surely what I have endured should be sufficient to expiate our crime. There is no hope for me, Jurian, in this world, then why should two lives be sacrificed? It is enough, I say, that one should feel condemned in the eye of heaven for an offence committed against the laws of man.” “Speak no more of it. Think not of me.” “What else have I to think of on earth! and when I behold this change can I do otherwise than speak? But a few weeks have passed since we parted, and your frame has wasted away—your voice is so hollow that I scarcely recognise its familiar tones,—and your hands—behold those swollen veins, attenuated fingers, and discoloured nails!—it is the hand of age already.” “Too much thought has made me ill, Miriam, since we parted.” “You must have been very ill to have produced so great a change!” “Doubtless, and yet I knew it not.” She brought the light, and examined his countenance intently— “What new lines are here! Familiar as that face is to me, I never before beheld those lines. Your hair has lost its gloss, it no longer curls as formerly, and— gracious heavens! it is sprinkled with gray!” “I knew not that. Put down the light, Miriam, put down the light.” She did so, and reseated herself beside him— “Were you not formerly acquainted with Foster?” “I was,” replied Jurian; “I knew him well. You remember but a few years ago he lived in our neighbourhood.” “I remember.” “Then wherefore the question?” “I thought it strange that he did not recognise you, but even I did not know you at first, which was more strange.” The conversation was now changed, and Jurian related the manner of his escape from his place of confinement at the Valley Forge. The evening preceding, Alice Grey called at the hut in which he was confined, and demanded of the guard permission to see her son. Honest Talman was on duty, and though he had discontinued the habit of smoking ever since the destruction of his meerschaum, it was remarked that on this occasion he had a pipe in his mouth; the same that Jurian had bestowed upon him years before. He also abounded in anecdote of the juvenile adventures of our hero, and if they did not appear more remarkable than were ever before performed by infant prodigy, it was not the fault of the partial narrator. Poor Mauns was not in the habit of talking much, but when on this theme, he would talk until his own eyes overflowed, and those of his hearers were closed, for there was scarcely a wild duck or a rockfish taken by Jurian, whose fate did not call forth the most minute description. Actions trifling in themselves, assume an aspect of importance when connected with one in whom we feel an interest. The wishes of Alice were no sooner made known to the sergeant than complied with. She entered the hut, and Mauns sat smoking at the door, the pipe, that through the misfortunes of the donor, had become dearer to him than ever was his favourite meerschaum. A few minutes after Alice had entered, Jurian came forth enveloped in her cloak; it was the dusk of the evening, and the sergeant being too single-minded to suppose that any thing like deception would be practised, satisfied himself with casting his eye on the figure, and perceiving the same dress, felt persuaded that all was well, while Jurian passed on to a spot beyond the limits of the camp, where he found M`Crea, with a horse and cloak, in waiting, who directed him to fly and conceal himself, until such time as he might appear in safety, assuring him that when the extent of his offence should be fully known, he did not doubt that all proceedings against him would be discontinued. The first use he made of his liberty was to visit Miriam, whose fate he had learnt from M`Crea. “Then my mother is still alive!” exclaimed Miriam, as he ceased speaking; “but driven from her home to wander through a scoffing world, with a daughter's shame added to her own sorrows—she cannot bear it long, and I shall have murdered her. That thought will kill me yet. O! Jurian, does she still think of me with kindness, or as a wretch who had doubly imbittered the last hours of a life of sorrow?” “She loves you as her child, and nothing but the hope of seeing you sustains her beneath her load of calamity.” “How had I the heart to forsake so good a mother! And yet, Jurian, even she has been cruel to me—but her cruelty was meant in kindness. When I last parted from you, I met her at the prison door, with Gordon— that wicked man, whose arts have destroyed my happiness 15* in this world. They were deaf to my entreaties, and forced me along the street to where my mother lodged. Gordon then left me alone with my mother, and she spoke not until he returned. O! Jurian, there was the concentrated agony of a whole life, in the few moments that I sat silent and self-condemned in the presence of my mother. I dared not to raise my eyes until Gordon returned. There was a man with him, a clergyman they said, who had come to make me the wife of him whom most on earth I abhorred.” “And you are now the wife of that guilty man?” “That curse is spared me! Heaven gave me strength to avoid that misery. Three times, Jurian, was the ceremony repeated, while my mother stood calmly by, without a sign of mercy in that face that hitherto had beamed alone with tenderness and love. My soul sunk, still I summoned all my strength to answer when the fearful question was proposed, and thrice I shrieked, `death sooner! death sooner!' Finding me resolute, Gordon and the clergyman left us, and my mother used every argument to convince me that the step was for my own salvation. Three days I was confined, during which her entreaties were unceasing; threats were resorted to, and the following day was fixed upon for the consummation of my fate, but that very night means of escape occurred, and I availed myself of it; whether for the better or the worse it is hard to tell.” “Had you remained, Miriam, we might have been spared an accumulation of suffering and guilt.” “O suffering, but not of guilt. Since that time, I have led a life of sincere penitence, and not of guilt. O! no, I have done nothing but weep and pray, but even when my thoughts were most free from sin, I am supposed to have been most guilty.” “The child, Miriam, the child?” “You cannot think me such a wretch! If you can doubt my innocence, what have I to hope from my judges?” “Miriam!” “Jurian, you have known me in my days of purity, when my heart did not harbour a single thought it would have concealed from the world. I need not say how madly I have loved you—more than any thing on earth, and at times, I fear, more than any thing in heaven. Then can you think I would have sought the life of the child of one so beloved, at a time when the little innocent was all that remained to me of you?” “Do not imagine that such a thought could enter my mind. No, Miriam, I know you are innocent of the fearful charge, but I would hear from your own lips all that occurred on that fatal night, that your innocence may be made manifest to the world.” “And wherefore? what is life to me? A name once deeply stained can never be purified; and it matters little whether falsehood has stamped the blot, or the the frailty of human nature has occasioned it. Few gain credit for their good actions, their evil ones are never to be forgotten; and though my innocence be made as clear as noonday, I shall never again raise my head among those who were the witnesses of my shame.” “Still, Miriam, remember you are about to answer a fearful charge, and I am here to save you, if possible, from a death of shame.” “True, true, and few have the fortitude not to struggle for life, even while they wish for death. I will recount to you all that I remember of that dreadful night. I had been turned from the house where I had sought shelter, for the mistress of it had discovered my shame, and had no mercy for the frailties of others, even while she expected it of heaven for her own. She closed her doors upon me with revilings, and though I was scarcely able to stand, and sick to the soul, I dragged my feeble limbs about a mile from the house, when I sunk exhusted upon the ground, where I lay near an hour, and earnestly did I pray to die. God willed it otherwise. Night had closed in, a storm was gathering, and there was every prospect that unless I found shelter my prayer would be heard before the morning. I have said we struggle for life even while we pray for death. I arose, and having been driven from the door of the prosperous, I determined to appeal to the compassion of the poor, whose sufferings had taught them to feel for others. After wandering for some time, the rain began to fall in torrents, the night was dark, and my strength had nearly failed, when I was attracted by a light to Gordon's cottage, and I knocked at the door and entered. Rather would I have stayed in the wood and perished than have entered there.” “Go on, Miriam, go on.” “The woman was at first kind to me, but I had not been seated long before Gordon came. At the sight of him I felt ready to die with terror, and was so feeble and distressed that I could scarcely move. On the instant the woman's conduct changed towards me. They retired together, and I fancied I overheard him mention my name. My fears increased, and even when left alone to sleep, I could not close my eyes. Before day the woman passed through the room where I lay, and left the house. The thought of being alone with my persecutor awakened my terrors to such a degree, that I silently arose and crawled into the wood, preferring any situation to that in which I was. The exertion was too much for me. I was seized with racking pains; my brain was wandering—there was but one idea that it could grasp, and that was, that I was hunted by my worst foe. I struggled and writhed in agony, for I thought he had fastened his fangs upon me, and was tearing me limb from limb. What I fled from, I knew not, for all was vague; still there was an undefined feeling that I contended in mortal strife with the most appalling creature that imagination could form. O God! Jurian, what I did suffer on that night! Long I contended; I thought the strife would never be over, and was astonished at my own strength that enabled me to bear up against the tortures I endured. At length the agonies of death came over me; I shrieked —it was the only shriek I had uttered—it was followed by a momentary consciousness, and I swooned. How long I remained in this state I know not, but when I awoke it was daylight, and I felt as though I were in heaven. My relief was but momentary, for the first object that struck my sight was a dead infant beside me, and madness returned.” As Miriam concluded, Foster again appeared in the passage, and opened the door of a cell opposite to that in which she was confined. Jurian turned at the sound, and both doors being partly open, he caught a glimpse of Gordon in the opposite room, secured with shackles. Foster placed a pitcher of water upon the table, and demanded of the prisoner whether he desired any thing further, as it was time to lock up for the night. “In good faith, Foster,” replied Gordon, “you are too humane by half for your calling, and appear unwilling to lose sight of your old acquaintance Jones in the highwayman Gordon; however, I shall not trouble you again to-night.” As the jailor was about returning, Gordon perceived Jurian, and demanded of Foster who he was. “A friend of Miriam's,” replied the other, “who has come to consult with her on the subject of her approaching trial, and I hope he may be able to make out a good defence.” “Do you know who it is?” demanded Gordon, keeping his eyes fixed upon the figures in the opposite room. “He is a stranger to me,” replied Foster, “though he bears some resemblance to Jurian Hartfield. I would have spoken to him for master Jurian, but that this man is ten years older at least than the other. I suppose it is some lawyer who intends to undertake the defence of poor Miriam.” “If so, Foster, he will not object to having two clients, nor I to an additional counsel. Will you permit me to say a word to him? for I would secure the whole bar, and judges and jury too, if it were practicable, for I fear my case will require pretty strong argument.” “I am for letting every man have a fair chance for his life, Gordon, and if you think that this gentleman will be able to throw dust in the eyes of the jury, tell him your story and set him to work.” Gordon approached the door slowly; he was heavily ironed, and the clanking of his chains awakened the attention of Miriam, who recoiled as he approached. He stood silent in the door-way, and his hard features denoted something like feeling, as he contemplated the forlorn state of the miserable girl. Foster intimated to Jurian that the prisoner wished to speak to him, and he rose and approached the spot where Gordon stood. “Do not leave me,” cried Miriam, clinging to him. “I shall not leave you; but why do you tremble?” “The sight of that man recalls all that I have suffered. O do not leave me for an instant; do not speak to him! He has been the bane of your life, and if possible he will sting you to death before he dies. Avoid him as you would certain ruin.” “Be pacified; what have I to fear?” “I know not, but the sight of him has stricken such terror to my soul, that I feel convinced if you speak to him, you are lost. Your names have already been linked together, and beware how you give malice another hold upon you.” “What hold, Miriam?” “Remember, he is supposed to be a British spy;— he is about to answer the insulted laws of his country— and your name connected with that of a wretch like this, under existing circumstances, may prove fatal. He hates you, and will not die without showing it.” “Be it so; but his malice cannot reach me.” “Be not so confident, for even the poisonous spider can weave a powerful web from frail material.” This conversation, though carried on in an undertone, did not escape the quick ear of Gordon, and a change in his countenance indicated that jealousy and hate were already contending in his bosom. Jurian drew nigh to him, and said— “You desire to speak to me?” “I do, but in any other place than this, I should almost question whether you are the man. Can a few weeks have done the work of years?” “Spare your comments, and speak to the point.” “I shall be brief, sir, but I cannot refrain from expressing my astonishment at this change. I may presume, from the hazard you have run this night, that you still love Miriam, and as ardently as ever?” A slight shudder ran through the frame of Jurian, which he in vain endeavoured to conceal, as the other fixed his cold gray eye upon him. “Did you call me to catechise me?” demanded Jurian; “if so, farewell.” “Be not so hasty,” continued Gordon. “Though you may not love her as ardently as formerly, you doubtless have still sufficient regard remaining, to attempt to rescue her from her impending fate, since even I, though rather like the blustering November than the showery April, could weep for her.” “Her safety is the object of my visit here.” “It can be effected—draw this way. You are not aware that the evidence against her is strong enough to consign her to the gallows. She privately buried the child, at least so the law will say, and was absconding to conceal its death, when apprehended. Trust not to a jury, or her fate is certain.” “What hope has she but in the justice of her cause?” “Law and justice will not shake hands in the present case. But you know the statute better than I can explain. I remember, some three years ago, Mary Thorp, though as innocent as her dead babe of the charge brought against her, was convicted and sentenced upon slighter testimony than will appear against Miriam. You remember poor Mary, therefore trust not to a jury, I say, while there are means more certain.” “What means?” “The prison is not well guarded, and the door would soon yield before an axe or two.” “Explain yourself.” “I have always admired your courage, Mr. Hartfield, and now you have an opportunity of exercising it to some purpose. You know that the day after to-morrow her trial will take place.” “I know it, I know it.” “Follow my instructions, and in a few hours you will find yourself at the head of twenty determined men, and if led on by one of your spirit, the project cannot fail. To-morrow night attack the prison, and take my word for it, you will find it a surer way to save Miriam than trusting to law and justice.” “And is it for the sake of that poor girl, or your own, that I am to mingle with your unprincipled associates?” “For both; and surely you cannot refuse to save the life of one you love, because in doing so you may possibly benefit one you hate.” “Gordon, I have been your dupe more than once, but as my conduct heretofore has not been criminal, do not suppose from what has past, that I am ready to become the guilty instrument of a wretch so abandoned.” “Why give way to passion? What I propose is for your own good. Turn not away, but bethink you, if she dies, her blood will be upon your soul.” Jurian made no reply, but entered the room where Miriam was and closed the door after him. “And dare the moral idiot spurn my proposal!” exclaimed Gordon in a rage, “but he shall learn that I am not to be so easily foiled in what I undertake.” He dashed his foot violently against the door, and it flew open. “Come, sir,” he continued, “old friends should not part so soon and unceremoniously. I have a word or two more to say to you, so come and hear me.” “Do not stir from me,” exclaimed Miriam in agitation. “Let it not be said that you communed with that man in secret here, or utter ruin must follow.” “Peace, abandoned girl,” exclaimed Gordon, “lest your voice awaken the slumbering devil in my heart. Come, sir, I would speak to you, I say, and must I call a second time? You forget you are in my power.” “I despise your threats,” replied Jurian. “Foster, take that villain to his cell, that we may no longer be subjected to outrage.” “This from one who already has the halter around his neck! Be warned in time, for there is that within my bosom, which, if spoken—” “Begone, and do the worst your malice can suggest.” “Has the gallows then no terrors?” demanded Gordon, “or are you already steeped so deep in infamy, as to brave an ignominious death with composure? Reflect upon the course you have adopted: I would be your friend; be careful how you make me your foe.” “Better have him your foe than friend,” exclaimed Miriam, and clung around the neck of the young man. “Girl,” replied Gordon, his gray eye kindling with rage, “better that he had been your foe than friend; but if you have a spark of mercy for yourself or him remaining, raise not your feeble voice against me.” Miriam shrunk from his gaze, and concealed her face in Jurian's bosom. “Begone, villain,” cried Jurian, “and cease to insult this injured being, or I will strike you prostrate.” The eyes of Gordon flashed for a moment, and suddenly all was calm again. “Keep your temper,” he said, “for neither you nor myself will profit much by a war of words or blows. In VOL. II.—16 spite of all that has passed, circumstances compel us to bury our animosity. Again I will ask you to extend the hand of fellowship, and promise to befriend me. You know the way I mean.” “Never.” “Decide not rashly; weigh the matter well and dispassionately, for life or death depends upon your answer. Pause, I say, for you know me well enough to be convinced that I will not die singly.” “You have had your answer; leave the room.” “Have you no pity for my condition?” “Begone!” “No mercy for yourself?” “Leave the room, I say.” “No compassion for your sister?” saying which, he pointed his finger at Miriam, and the young man immediately sprang upon his throat, exclaiming— “Infernal fiend! could you not have spared me this?” The struggle was of short continuance, for Jurian's strength had been reduced by previous sickness, and the agony of his present feelings soon exhausted it. Gordon thrust him from him, and he fell to the floor. “His sister! what horrid tale is this!” shrieked Miriam. “There lies the son of old Alice Grey,” replied Gordon, coolly, “at least so the story goes, and he has received a lesson that will make him a better man for the future; and should he at any time stand in need of mercy, he will be ready to extend it towards others.” Miriam stood for a few moments petrified with horror, and then fell senseless upon the body of Jurian. “My errand is performed,” continued Gordon, turning to Foster. “My words are verified; I said I would not die alone. Think you not the shaft is there, old boy? and am I not a sure marksman to the last? Now lead me to my cell, for I grow weary; it is time to rest.” “What can all this mean?” demanded Foster in astonishment. “No matter, for the present,” replied Gordon, “but you must admit that he is a good marksman who can bring down two at a shot; say you not so, old boy?” Then slapping the jailor familiarly on the shoulder, he entered his cell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. Peace: thou hast told a tale, whose every word Threatens eternal slaughter to the soul. —Ford. The first rays of morning, as they stole through the grated window, discovered the miserable pair as mute as statues beside each other. No chiselled marble was paler, and they were as motionless, settled despair having already succeeded the deep agony of grief. Not a word had passed their lips during that tedious night of mental suffering, and the dead silence had scarcely been broken even by a convulsive sob. The shaft was poisoned with despair, and it no sooner reached the heart than the death of hope followed without a struggle. When they first awoke to a sense of their condition, after being left alone, the light of the lamp was insupportable to them, for it served to betray the one to the other, and they could not withstand each other's gaze. Jurian arose and extinguished it, and fervently did they pray, but no words passed their lips, that the sun might never rise again, and that time henceforth might become one eternal and starless night. With anguish did they behold the first rays of the sun gradually stealing along the wall, as it dispersed the sense of loneliness with which the gloom of night had enveloped them, and they no longer desired to look upon a joyous world in which they could not mingle. Miriam was the first to break the deep silence that had prevailed for hours. The sound was an involuntary ejaculation from the heart, and scarcely audible— “It is already day!” she sighed. “Where shall I hide myself from the eyes of the world; where from the sight of heaven!” “Miriam, speak to me. Let me hear the sound of your voice again. This fearful conflict of thought must be interrupted, or it will terminate in madness. Speak to me, in pity speak to me.” She turned to him, struggled to speak, and burst into tears. “Weep on, Miriam,” he continued. “Thank God that you can weep, for tears may assuage the anguish of your heart. O! that I could weep with you.” “Have you not wept? Your eyes are red as fire.” “And burn like fire; but I cannot weep. I have not shed one tear. Thought has become as subtle and scorching as flame, and it seems as if the very fountain of tears were dried within me. My heart is swoln too large for my bosom, my eyeballs ache to bursting, and yet the natural channels that might relieve my anguish are closed. I have often thought if I could weep I should feel relieved.” “I now no longer wonder at the alteration in your appearance that I remarked last night.” “Incessant thought has wasted my frame away, for what chance has the body when the mind is struggling to cast off its earthly fetters! I knew not, until lately, the mighty attributes of that mercurial essence. They say that the human form is its dwelling place, and yet the bounds of the universe are too narrow to confine it. The elements cannot obstruct its progress, for it will traverse the world of waters to their uttermost limits in an instant, and cleave the highest heaven with greater rapidity than light itself can travel. No place is so sacred that it may not enter. It can delve through the earth to the centre, and hear the groans of the condemned; and it can stray unfettered through the happy 16* fields above, and at times even the judgment seat of the Most High appears to be approachable. At least so it seemed to me; for there methought I have stood, Miriam, for days together, awaiting my sentence, loth to depart until judgment should be pronounced upon me. And so strongly was I impressed with the belief that it was no hallucination of mind, but that I had actually visited the world of spirits, and learnt that I should there be adjudged with greater clemency than on earth, that at times my soul has cast off the mountain that weighs upon it, and resumed the serenity of former days.” “How can that be!” “And wherefore should it not be? It is the intention that constitutes the crime, and not the act, for crimes of the deepest die have been perpetrated, and passed under the name of virtues. Human sacrifices have been made to appease the gods of the heathen, and the judge of Israel offered up his own daughter, and believed the unnatural sacrifice acceptable to a merciful Judge. And was he criminal, or was the appalling act purged and purified by the deep devotion that dictated it? If the intent can divest such a deed of its horror and criminality, and instead of punishment it is to meet with reward, then surely, Miriam, there can be no crime in any act, if crime were not intended.” “Why reason thus? We are steeped to the lips in sin, and no sophistry can shake that dreadful conviction!” “And what is sin, my sister?” “O! call me not by that name! Until I am dead, never breathe that word again.” “It shall be buried in my heart, Miriam. But what do you understand by sin? Are the principles of right and wrong immutable? Came they into the world when creation was new, or have they grown out of human institutions, so that that which was sanctioned and enjoined upon man in one age, may become an offence against heaven in another? If so, and there be no appeal from the opinions that now prevail, we are indeed criminal, but if that race of people, who we are taught to believe possessed the most immediate knowledge of the divine law, sinned not with their eyes open, then Miriam, there is still room for us to hope, for that which was free from moral guilt at one period, no subsequent rule that man may prescribe for his conduct can render otherwise. True, the infringement of those rules may call forth human punishment, and to keep them inviolate, man in his arrogance may threaten us with divine vengeance, and impiously lay down a rule of action for the Creator, but it does not follow that those rules shall be recognised beyond this world.” “Whither would you lead me?” “If human laws are to test the degree of moral turpitude, there can be nothing more undefined and uncertain in its nature than crime, for that which one nation sanctions another may condemn, and deeds which at one period were calculated to paralyze every hope in heaven, at another may be considered justifiable.” “Can our crime ever be palliated?” “Call it not crime—we are unhappy, but not criminal. We are taught to believe, Miriam, that there was a period when the natural ties that subsist between us, would have been so many links to bind us more closely together. Who was it that solaced Cain in his wanderings? Who was it that Abel took to his bosom? There are many instances wherein it was pronounced right that the germ of natural affection should be permitted to expand, and that the ties which heaven had entwined should be strengthened by those which earth had created. But that is no longer right; and I am aware that he who credits it has a fearful weight of human condemnation on him; heavier than mortal can contend with, but has he also the condemnation of heaven to oncounter?” “O! do not reason thus! You are mad, Jurian! It is blasphemy to doubt it.” “I fear it is; but like a drowning man, Miriam, I grasp in my desperation even at the bubbles on the surface. I have endeavoured to divest myself of the prejudices of education, to turn the mind into a frightful path that heretofore it trembled to enter, and I have laboured to extinguish the very light of reason, that I might not see the inky waters that lay before me, but I struggle in vain, and like a weary swimmer soon must sink. O, Miriam, is it not a fearful thing to be plunged thus in utter despair—to meet with execration here, and condemnation hereafter, for crimes of which we were unconscious! In trying one accused, by human laws, they judge him by the intent, and if the absence of evil design be manifest, no matter how atrocious the wrong inflicted, but slight stain is left upon him. Then is it just that we should be utterly condemned who knew not—It cannot be possible! We will not sink yet! Hope, Miriam, hope!” “For nothing in this world.” “True, there is nothing left us here. Our race is run—but in the next! Look there, with confidence look there.” “I dare not raise my eyes—my thoughts ascend, but the weight is so heavy they sink to earth again.” “Despair not yet. Let me not see you sink. Struggle to bear up. You must not sink.” “What have we to hope for?” “Every thing to hope, and nothing to lose. Let not thine eye rest upon earth, or thou canst not fail being wretched. Look abroad, and thou wilt perceive that it has been so ordered that even the most abject may behold more of heaven than earth in his pilgrimage. It matters not whether he stand upon the mountain top or in the depth of the valley, still heaven appears to him boundless, while the orb he treads upon is circumscribed.” “But in all that boundless space is there one spark of mercy for me?” “Doubt not, Miriam. Bear up, or you are lost. Suffer not despair to take such full possession of your soul, that not a spark of hope remains to solace.” “It is in vain to struggle, Jurian. Support me; I would lie down.” “How pale you are, and faint! Gracious God! you are dying!” “Not dying—not yet; but sick to the soul.” “Mercy, mercy heaven!” “O! that I dare pray!” He supported her to the bed, and she lay down and covered her face with her hands. He kneeled beside her, and a few minutes after Foster opened the door of the cell and ushered in M`Crea. Jurian rose as he entered, and on recognising the surgeon, he exclaimed in a deep and hurried tone— “It is well, sir, that you have come, that you may behold how one sin begets another, and witness, before you die, the last bitter fruits of your own crime. You have been a prolific source of misery to many, but here lay your last victims, and earth supports not two so utterly wretched.” “I must answer for my own sins, Jurian,” replied M`Crea; “but why am I to be reproached with your's?” “Because they are but fruits of the same tree. Had you not been criminal, I should have been innocent, and that polluted one have passed from this world as spotless as she entered it. To you alone, sir, is to be attributed our eternal shame and misery.” “Add not to the bitterness of the present moment, by reproaching the gray head of your father with the errors of his youth,” replied M`Crea, with evident agitation. “Is it now a time to claim the name of father,” replied Jurian, “when it can be of little moment to you, and of less to me? We have passed through life, thus far, as strangers, and have but a few more steps to travel, then where is the use of making a parade at parting?” “Unfeeling boy! can you disown a penitent parent, and treat him as a stranger!” “Did not that penitent parent disown his son? You cast me off, from infancy, and yet expect to find a heart overflowing with filial love, without bearing in mind that your neglect was calculated to chill every germ of affection that nature may have implanted in my bosom. Your kindness never put a pulse in action. The channels of natural love, if such there be, were soon chilled; the warm blood never passed through them, and it is now too late to find the way. That fault rests on your head, not mine. It is in vain, sir, to trust to natural ties when we refuse to create factitious ones, and too frequently are the latter mistaken for the former, as I am perfectly satisfied that they do not exist in this bosom. I can readily conceive that there can be no bond so strong, no friendship so sincere, as that which may exist between father and son, but then it rests with the father to create it. Implanted in infancy and growing with years, it may at times be mistaken for the mysterious link by which nature is supposed to connect those of the same blood, but my heart can recognise no such tie.” “Is it in man's nature to become so depraved, as to lose all feeling for the author of his being?” “True, I owe you life, but look into the extent of the obligation. I was stigmatized with shame when first I breathed, and you were the cause. In my progress through life that shame has adhered to me as a consuming leprosy, and there is no cure. It was your will that I should enter upon the world a proscribed being; with a ban against me that even the grave cannot remove. You foresaw this, and yet cared not. You curst me at my birth, avoided me through life, and now expect me to bless you in return. The talismanic word of father can work no miracle in a heart that has never experienced a father's love.” “O! spare me, my son,” exclaimed M`Crea. “Spare me the most humiliating consequence of crime. A father to be rebuked by his offspring—to have the errors of his youth called up in judgment against him, until he trembles with shame and remorse; to have the death-wound torn open and made bleed anew, by the hands of a son, is unnatural. Spare me that; and if you knew what I have already endured, your bitter reproaches would be changed for tears of compassion.” “It may not be expected,” replied Jurian, in the same cold tone, “that he who cannot shed a tear for his own griefs, will weep for those of another. But why still dwell upon the tie that should exist between father and son? Let us remove the veil that blinds your better judgment. Am I indebted for my existence to the gratification of your own selfish passions, or to a holy wish to possess a son in whom your affections might concentrate? Assuredly to the former, and you would have rejoiced if death had removed me from your sight when I first breathed. I was looked upon as a foe to your peace. Nature formed no covenant between us, at least you did not acknowledge it, and from that hour, through life, we have been as strangers to each other. Then wherefore should you expect to find a heart overflowing with natural love for you? As well might the husbandman who scatters no seed look for a golden harvest, and complain at finding nothing but weeds and nettles. “Jurian, I feel in all its force the truth of your rebuke. I have lost a son by my own injustice towards him, and such a one as would have realized my most sanguine hopes. But it is not yet too late to redeem what has past.” “It is now too late. As well might you expect verdure from the tree that the lightning has blasted, as to revive hope in this bosom. Behold the change that a few days have effected, and you may conclude that the cause is deep rooted, and not upon the surface. And look there,” he continued, pointing at Miriam, who sighed deeply, and sobbed aloud, “the storm has also passed over that delicate flower: think you, will it ever hold up its head again? No, never in this world; she has been too cruelly crushed, and there is no relief but in the grave. Look there, I say; and can you recall in that forlorn being the once lovely creature whose joyous voice filled every heart with gladness? Behold, and reflect that to your errors may be traced this utter desolation.” “To my errors! I am lost in amazement. In what manner have I wronged her?” “Had you been candid to me; had I known to whom I owed my being, she would still have been innocent, and escaped the accumulation of horror that now weighs her to the earth. But, no, the secret was preserved until our ruin was consummated, and then divulged to show the extent of our guilt, and the hopelessness of our fate. Why was it not permitted to die in the bosom that had sheltered it so long! Why was it at this time brought to light, and with it the damning truth that I had laid the crime of incest on my sister's soul. It would have been mercy to have let us died in ignorance of this.” “Jurian, hear me.” “And wherefore? Is it in the power of words to extenuate your conduct, or mitigate my crime? If not, it is but idle waste of breath to speak. Go, and leave us.” “Hear me, I say. Your offence does not assume the frightful aspect you imagine, for she is not your sister.” “Merciful heaven! say on.” “I repeat it; she is not the child of Alice Grey, who is at hand to attest the truth of what I now assert.” “Can this be true! Miriam, hearest thou the words he has spoken? Thou art not my sister. Arise from the bed of eternal death, to new life, my Miriam, for thou art not my sister.” The poor girl sobbed as if her heart were breaking, while Jurian continued— “Be comforted, for if this prove true, we shall be relieved of more than half our wretchedness.” “I know not what to think,” she replied. “My brain is bewildered, and like a troubled sleeper, I but pass from one horrid dream to another.” “But thou hearest, thou art not my sister—that frightful dream is over. Awaken thy mind to a full sense of that truth, and it will inspire you with new life, and give you courage to bear what remains.” “Yes, thank God, that dream is over—a dream that I feared would disturb even the repose of the grave. But how is it over! Are we awake, and find it but a dream? Perchance, Jurian, we but sleep deeper, and the horrible phantom will again return.” “Here is one will put it to flight forever,” said M`Crea, as Alice entered. “My mother!” “Not your mother, Miriam, not your mother,” replied Alice, receiving her in her arms. Alice now stated that Miriam was her sister's child; that the child she had by Corwin had died shortly after she deserted her husband, and that her sister dying, leaving Miriam an orphan, she had adopted her and brought her up as her own. She further stated, that the deranged condition of her mind had prevented her from informing Jurian of the nature of his relationship with the unhappy girl, nor had she, until a short time previous, reverted to what might be their sufferings while labouring under the belief that they were so nearly allied in blood. This thought came upon her as VOL. II.—17 soon as she had effected the escape of Jurian, and nearly drove her frantic, as she now saw no means of communicating the secret to him. She believed that he would fly the country, and remain undeceived until death, while a single word from her lips would have spared him a life of misery. While occupied with these reflections, M`Crea entered the cabin in which she was confined, and she made known her feelings to him. He left her to consult with captain Swain, who immediately acquainted the commander-in-chief with all the circumstances of the case—the fact of her having placed the life of her own son in jeopardy—his subsequent escape —the deception that had been practised upon the guard, and the nature of the offence for which Jurian had been arrested; the result was an immediate order for the liberation of Alice, and a promise to suffer the young man's conduct to pass without undergoing a public investigation, as there was no evidence against him, except that which was now locked up in the bosom of his mother, and as the charge appeared to have been dictated by the spirit of revenge. Their minds were relieved by this information, although the weight of misery that still remained, under different circumstances would have been sufficient to crush them, yet we are happy or wretched by comparison, and the magnitude of their offence had so greatly diminished, that they felt comparatively happy. Jurian was permitted to go at large, as Foster had no warrant for his detention, and was unacquainted with the transactions at Valley Forge. The day of trial arrived. The principal witnesses that appeared against Gordon, were Ephraim Horn and the woman who had betrayed him; others came forward to testify as to their having been robbed on the public road, and identified the prisoner as the person who had waylaid them. There were no witnesses on behalf of Paul, except 'squire Morton and Nicholas the innkeeper, both of whom bore testimony as to the general good conduct of the party accused; but this had little weight, as the evidence before the court left not a shadow of doubt as to the guilt of the prisoner. Gordon, during the trial, behaved with calmness and self-possession. He cross-examined Ephraim with considerable adroitness, and notwithstanding the solemnity of the investigation, more than once elicited a laugh from the jurors and the thoughtless by-standers. When Madge came to the book to be sworn, his countenance fell, and his demeanour became serious. He turned his face from her, and said a few words to Nicholas, who was standing hard by; wishing to conceal under the veil of indifference, the emotion occasioned by the presence of his betrayer. The testimony of Madge was conclusive, but the treacherous part she had performed excited abhorrence in the minds of all who listened to her. Her testimony was no sooner received than she withdrew among the crowd of spectators to conceal herself from observation, and as she passed the prisoners' box she covered her face, and did not venture to encounter the gaze of the man her voice had condemned to the gallows. Paul scarcely turned his eyes towards her as she passed. He was found guilty by the jury without leaving the box, and the awful sentence of the law was pronounced by the judges. The trial of Miriam came on. The interest excited by her appearance was intense. She was as pale as death, and so feeble that her limbs could scarcely support her, when the clerk of the court called upon her to stand forth and hold up her right hand, while he read the indictment. At a few paces distant on the right of the prisoners stood M`Crea and his son, awaiting in dreadful suspense the event of the trial, while the agitated Alice was leaning on the railing immediately behind the prisoners. Silence was strictly observed throughout the court-house, as every one appeared to be too much engrossed with his own feelings to be communicative. The witnesses examined were corporal Drone, the countrymen who were present at the time of discovering the infant, Madge Haines, and Ephraim the Quaker. The corporal stated the circumstances of the case as they appeared, but as he could not relieve his mind from prejudice in favour of the prisoner, he was unwilling to permit a cause of such importance to rest solely with the ingenuity of the counsel employed; he accordingly gave his own colouring to the case, and was prepared to enter largely into its merits, but was interrupted in his harangue, and desired to confine himself solely to an unvarnished statement of the facts, which somewhat disconcerted the corporal, and materially abridged the thread of his story. He was mortified at losing so fine an opportunity of displaying his eloquence, and after repeating the facts three or four times over, with several fruitless attempts to branch out, he was dismissed, and he resumed his station among the crowd. The countrymen corroborated the statement of Drone, but Madge when called upon, was governed by her jealously, and gave quite a different colouring to the charge against the unfortunate Miriam. She commenced with the time she first knocked at the door, previous to the arrival of Paul, and supplied her narrative with fictitious circumstances, alleged to have transpired during the night, which, if credited, went fully to establish the guilt of the prisoner, and that the deed was in agitation before the unhappy victim was ushered into the world. Her testimony was heard with patience to the close, when Paul rose, and in a deep voice, exclaimed— “It is a fabrication from the beginning to the end. If you will hear me, I will state the facts fairly and impartially. I am a doomed man; this world is nothing to me now, you may therefore depend upon what I say, for I have now no reason to deviate from the truth.” One of the attornies suggested, that as Paul was a convict, his testimony was inadmissible, and he was accordingly rejected. “I am then thrown beyond the pale of society,” exclaimed Paul, his large gray eyes kindling; “be it so; I have lost but little by it, if the word of a sinner has sufficient weight with you to take away the life of a saint. Beware, lest you condemn to death a lovely being who has been guilty of but one fatal error, upon the bare assertion of a wretch, covered with crime, and so blotched, that all the fires below will not purify her. Her offence towards me is sufficient to blast her character, and impugn her testimony. Doubtless I merited punishment, but not at her hands. She should have been the first to protect; but was the first to betray. What act have I been guilty of, that is not spotless, compared to her treachery? And yet the law protects and cherishes her, and sends me to the gallows.” He was interrupted by the judge, and ordered to sit down; Paul obeyed reluctantly, and the testimony of Ephraim Horn was taken, as to what transpired during the brief residence of Miriam at his house. Having heard all the testimony, the lawyers addressed the jury, and were listened to with breathless silence by the friends of the unfortunate girl. During the speech of her advocate, a slight ray of hope stole across their countenances; which gave place to the gloom of despair, as the counsel for the prosecution proceeded in his harangue. He was the abler man; nature had lavished on him the persuasive power of eloquence, by which the light of reason becomes obscure, and the spotless robe of innocence is made to appear as the garb of hypocrisy—by which the most virtuous action is converted into guilt, and a cherub's smile into the grin of a demon. Hope fled from the bosoms of Miriam and her friends, as the opposing advocate concluded. Alice, in her despair, cried out, “Do not listen to him—there is poison in his words—he has prostituted God's gifts to the service of Satan—he has doomed to death the innocent—he has robbed the widowed mother of her child!” She was silenced; the jury retired, and shortly after returned a verdict that the prisoner was guilty of concealing the death of her 17* child. As the clerk pronounced the verdict, Miriam fainted in the prisoners' box, and was supported by Gordon, while Jurian bent over the railing to assist her, and Paul placed her in his arms, accompanied with a look which bespoke the deep contrition of his soul. Alice stood horrorstruck, and M`Crea could not conceal from the by-standers how deeply he was interested in the scene. Miriam revived, sentence was pronounced, and the court adjourned. As the judge was speaking, the poor girl repeatedly exclaimed, “I am innocent; as God is my witness I am innocent;” but the acquittal by the conscience of the accused has but little weight in this world, if the voices of his fellow mortals pronounce him guilty. The prisoners were taken back to the jail. Gordon walked firmly but dejectedly by the side of Foster. Jurian and his wretched mother supported Miriam, dissolved in tears, to the prison door, where he left them, and went in search of M`Crea, who had been led out of the court-house, overpowered by his feelings, as soon as the unhappy result of the trial was made known. Alice entered the prison with Miriam, and Foster obtained permission for her to remain with her daughter until the day of execution should arrive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. You must rise and be hanged, master Barnardine. Measure for Measure. The day fixed for the execution of Gordon and Miriam having arrived, a large concourse of people assembled, at an early hour, to witness the awful scene. The gallows was erected upon a common, a short distance from Westchester village, and every tree in its vicinity was bending with anxious spectators. Human nature, however sublimated, possesses the power of extracting a horrid sense of enjoyment from scenes too appalling to contemplate in solitude. Few who join the crowd to behold a public execution, could bear to be the solitary witness of the violent death of a fellow being, and yet, if the bustle and circumstance of the world be around us, we become philosophical, and calmly count the struggles it requires to force an immortal soul from its tenement of clay to the presence of its Creator. The street in front of the prison was crowded, and as every one was anxious to get the first look, it was with difficulty that the guard could keep the passage open to the door. A short thickset man, whose bushy beard gave him the appearance of a Jew in mourning, made repeated attempts to get as near as practicable, but was constantly repulsed by the guard, which he bore with dogged perseverance, until he reached the station he was ambitious of attaining. His arms were folded, and he hung down his head as if wishing to avoid observation, but kept his eyes riveted towards the door, from which no remark of the crowd could divert them. The impatience of the crowd increased as the hour approached for the appearance of the condemned, and there were those whose curiosity was excited to such a degree, that they begrudged the few fleeting moments of preparation allowed to those who were to suffer. We revert with horror to the cruel pastime of the Romans, who condemned the gladiator to death for the amusement of the multitude. We recoil from the bloody sacrifices that bigotry has required, under the mask of religion, from the commencement of the annals of the world to the present hour, and we shudder at the hellish delight experienced by the child of the forest, while dancing like a fiend around the fire that consumes his foe. The philanthropist recalls these appalling scenes, and rejoices at the melioration of mankind; but has that savage feeling yet been rooted from the human heart, or does it only slumber from the want of stimulus to awaken it? Behold the crowds that constantly flock to every public execution, as to a place of recreation, and notwithstanding the boasted improvement that has taken place, we are irresistibly led to the conclusion, that the important change is of as little moment as the migrations of the honest vicar of Wakefield, from the blue bed to the brown. At length the prison door was unbarred, and Foster appeared with Alice and M`Crea, who had just taken a final leave of the unhappy Miriam. The outward signs of grief had subsided, but the heart was inwardly bleeding, as they took their station beside the person above described, who no sooner recognised Alice than he stepped back to make room for the mourner. The doors were again thrown open and the prisoners came forth, Paul walking with a firm and steady step. His ruddy features were somewhat bleached by thought and imprisonment, but the fire in his large gray eyes was still undiminished. He was clad in white, a cap was on his head, his hands were bound behind him, and the halter was about his neck. Miriam had been subjected to similar treatment, and she was dressed in white also. Her step was faltering, her eyes cast down, and red, and her countenance was as pale as death, but calm and resigned. She was supported by one of the officers of justice, who appeared more affected by the melancholy duty he had to perform, than the unfortunate being he assisted. When they arrived in front of the spot where Alice stood, the heart-broken woman sobbed aloud, and called upon her child by name. The eyes of all were directed towards her, and Paul as he turned caught a glimpse of the rugged figure standing beside her, and a gleam of recognition crossed his pallid countenance, as he beheld his friend Nicholas, the quondam host of the Crooked Billet. Nicholas raised his shaggy eyebrows, as his eyes met those of Gordon, and they gazed on each other for a moment in silence, but their looks were pregnant with meaning. “Have I any friends here to see me die?” demanded Paul, in a subdued tone. “More than one,” responded Nicholas, but in such a guarded manner, that even those who stood next to him knew not from whom the answer proceeded. “Then I shall die,” replied Paul, “as the upright man dieth, surrounded by his friends.” “Even so must you die,” was the answer returned, but Nicholas looked not towards him as he spoke, and Paul had turned his face in an opposite direction. He then bent his head in token of farewell, his features resumed their former sternness, and he firmly moved forward towards the cart prepared to receive him, and in his passage he recognised several of his lawless companions mingling in the crowd. Miriam followed closely behind him, and as they advanced, Alice rushed forward, and laying hold of her garments, exclaimed— “O! God, you will not murder my child. Monsters, she is innocent, and you lead the lamb to slaughter.” The guards thrust her back; she rushed forward a second time, and threw her arms around the feeble frame of Miriam. “Spare her life; O! spare her, or you must answer to God for the shedding of innocent blood. She is innocent, I say, as innocent as the saints in heaven, of murder; then why drag her to death!” The guard attempted to tear them asunder, rather rudely, for Alice in her agony clasped the poor girl so firmly, that considerable force was required to separate them. “Do not injure my poor mother,” said Miriam. “Respect her feelings, though you spare not mine.” “We must do our duty,” was the reply, and Alice was driven back to the crowd. “If you are not merciless,” she cried, “let me embrace my child once again before you murder her.” “Lead on; the time has already expired,” said Foster, and they advanced slowly. “If you would have the prayers of a broken-hearted mother,” continued Alice, “grant me but one kiss, and I will yield her to your bloody justice.” They still advanced, and she fell on her knees. “I beseech you, let me but touch her hand—her garment—and I will yield her up without a murmur. Hear me, as you would have God hear you in your extremest need. I ask but to touch my child—to have one look from her before she dies—and can you deny a broken-hearted mother even this!” Still they moved on. “Farewell, mother,” sighed Miriam. “Let us hope to meet in a better world, for we meet no more in this.” “My child, my child!” Mercy was deaf to the petition of Alice, but as it fell upon the cold ear of Gordon, it found the way to his soul, and awakened recollections far more painful than the remembrance of the offences for which he was about to suffer, for his villany had occasioned the misery that he witnessed. He shuddered at every word that passed the lips of Alice, as she continued her petition `for one kiss,' until they reached the cart, when they were placed in it, and the procession slowly moved on towards the gallows, while Alice and M`Crea followed with the rest of the crowd. As the procession moved, Nicholas hurried on and stationed himself as near the gallows as the guards would permit, and near him stood the dwindled figure of Ephraim Horn, with spectacles on nose, and elongated to his utmost altitude, in order to have a full view of the coming scene. At a short distance from Ephraim stood the corporal, and beside him the false Delilah of the hapless Gordon. As Nicholas cast his lowering eyes upon the company he was in, the corporal made an attempt to renew their former intimacy, but mine host eyed him sternly from head to foot, and turning away, muttered something like the Devil's benediction. The corporal retreated a few paces, and did not make a second attempt to attract the notice of the once jovial host of the Crooked Billet. He spoke to Mistress Haines, but she was engrossed with her own reflections, and her eyes were riveted on the spectacle before her. He then turned to Ephraim, but as the spirit had not yet moved the man of primitive manners to pay the promised reward for the conviction of Gordon, he also turned a deaf ear to the salutation of the corporal, and would not suffer even a violent tug at his skirts to attract his attention. He seemed as though his mind were wholly engrossed in moralizing on the awful scene, though he found it impossible to disengage it from the idea of five pounds sterling money, the amount of Drone's demand. This is not strange, as we occasionally meet with men who can get their whole souls within the narrow compass of a sixpence. The corporal, however, was one of those who are not to be put off with a slight rebuff, and as the first tug at the Quaker's skirts was unnoticed, he tried a second, which brought forth an ejaculation from the spirit of Ephraim. “Verily, it is an awful thing to meet Death and all his terrors, when one is unprepared!” But as this had no bearing upon the corporal's five pounds, he responded— “And, verily, it is an awful thing to meet a creditor, when one is unprepared!” This was spoken in a tone loud enough to excite the attention of all around, but Ephraim, and as the corporal was a persevering man, he tried a third and a fourth tug, until the stitches in Ephraim's skirts began to crack, when it appeared that he had not entirely lost the sense of hearing, for he turned hastily upon the corporal, and exclaimed— “Verily, friend, I believe thou art picking my pocket, and unless thou dost desist, I shall be compelled to hand thee over to justice.” “Bear witness,” cried the corporal, “he charges me with picking his pocket, and he shall either prove his words, or learn what it is to slander the character of one who has served his country.” “I did not charge thee, friend, with picking my pocket,” replied Ephraim; “I mere expressed an opinion that thou wast doing it, and if I am in error, pray what dost thou mean by tugging thus at my coat?” “I would have five pounds hard money, fairly earned,” replied the corporal. “O! the power of Mammon!” exclaimed Ephraim. “Canst thou thirst for the vanities of this world at such a time as this?” “To be sure I can,” replied the other, “and hunger after them too.” “Reflect upon the evanescent condition of thy mortal state.” “I do, and therefore want my five pounds to sustain it.” “Remember, friend, that thou hast at this present speaking a coat of mine upon thy back, which I consider a fair and legal setoff against thy demand of five pounds.” “Your coat be d—d,” cried the corporal, “you have already been paid two prices for it, with the usual allowance for staytape and buckram. But a word in your ear, old broadbrim. If I cannot get my five pounds out of your pocket, burn me if I do not take it out of your hide.” “Verily, I cannot give ear unto thee now, for my spirit is otherwise engaged.” Ephraim endeavoured to move out of his way, but Drone stuck close to his skirts, vociferating for his five pounds, and boasting of the magnanimous part he had played in the apprehension of Paul. The cart containing the prisoners now drove under the gallows, and an address to the Dispenser of all good was made by an aged man who officiated on the occasion. The prayer being closed, he sung a hymn, in which he was joined by those immediately around the gallows. The clear full voice of Nicholas was heard above the rest, and his head was now elevated, and his rugged features exposed. Madge also joined the chant, but her head was bent down on her breast, and her voice was tremulous and almost inaudible. Among the crowd, the reckless companions of Gordon were seen moving to and fro; he recognised them as they passed, but from the armed force on the ground, he was aware that any attempt at rescue would be fruitless. Alice Grey looked on in despair; the hood of her cloak hanging on her shoulders, her head bare, and her eyes riveted upon the faded form of Miriam, whose pallid face was raised towards heaven. The hymn being finished, the executioner demanded of Paul VOL. II.—18 whether he wished to address the multitude, but he shook his head, signifying that he did not, and the executioner proceeded in his duty. He secured the rope around the beam of the gallows, adjusted the knot, and drew the white cap over the eyes of the criminal. “Why am I to be hoodwinked?” demanded Paul. “Raise the cap from my eyes, that I may look upon the world as long as I remain in it.” “It is the custom,” said the executioner. “To live blindly, but not to die blindly,” replied Paul. “This holy man has been labouring to open my eyes, and you would foolishly close them. Come, let me die with my eyes open.” Miriam turned her face with horror from the appalling ceremony, and Gordon stood erect in the cart, while all eyes were directed towards him in fearful expectation, and a dead silence prevailed throughout the concourse. The silence was broken by the sound of a bugle, which was succeeded by a press in the crowd towards the gallows. Paul recognised the familiar notes of his own bugle, he saw the movement in the crowd, and a momentary hope arose that his companions would yet attempt to save him. It was, however, but a fleeting hope, for the next instant he heard the voices of the guards commanding the crowd to stand back, and the heavy tread of the mass receding. Order was again restored. Miriam's terrors had nearly deprived her of every faculty, physical and mental. Her eyes were vacant and tearless, her cheeks ashy pale, and her lips as colourless as her cheeks. She trembled in every joint; every muscle was relaxed, and her languid head fell upon the bosom of the executioner. As he gazed upon her, a tear dropped from his glazed eyeballs upon the death-like cheek of the law's victim. It was but a momentary gush of feeling, and his pulse again beat as temperately as ever, as he proposed the usual question, whether she forgave him. “You have never wronged me,” she faintly replied, “then what have I to forgive?” “He would be forgiven the wrong he is about to do,” replied Gordon; “and as it will be too late to ask the question after it is done, he prudently takes time by the forelock.” “Let him rest satisfied, I shall carry no animosity to the grave.” He now systematically adjusted the knot, cast the cord over the gallows, and ascended the ladder to fasten it, while Foster supported her. Alice stood gazing at the fearful preparation, stupified with horror. All her faculties seemed to have abandoned her. She watched every act that was done with painful intensity, but neither attempted to speak nor move. Her lips quivered, she gasped for breath, and big drops of perspiration stood upon her forehead as the executioner secured the rope around the beam. The feelings of the frantic mother were wrought to a crisis; human nature could bear no more; she rushed forward a few steps, uttered a frantic shriek, and fell to the ground. Miriam recognised her as she fell, and exclaimed, in an agony of grief— “Mother, mother! why are you here!” “My child! O! spare my child! “Away, and let me die. Farewell! and may heaven support you in this affliction. Mother, beloved, farewell!” Her voice was inarticulate, and scarcely audible, and as she concluded, her head sunk upon Foster's bosom. Corporal Drone, and some of the by-standers, advanced to administer relief to Alice, while one of the officers demanded of the executioner, who had paused in the administration of his duty, whether all was ready, to which Foster replied that she had fainted, and was still unconscious of what was passing. “We are nearly an hour over the time appointed for her death,” continued the other. “It would be unchristianlike to take her life while in this state,” observed Foster. “Then wait until she revives.” “That will be at the day of judgment,” added Gordon, eyeing the motionless and relaxed form of the hapless girl, as she was supported in the arms of the jailor. Some confusion and uproar now took place in the crowd, and immediately after a man appeared on horseback, bareheaded, his hair flying loosely, and his shirt open. He dashed through the crowd like a madman, heedless of whom he trampled on; his horse was in a foam, and he rode to the foot of the gallows, in spite of the resistance of the guards, who attempted to thrust him back. He checked his horse, and casting a look of distraction towards the gallows, exclaimed— “She is reprieved, she is reprieved! but, merciful heaven! I am too late!” Saying which, he fell exhausted from his seat to the earth. “What is the meaning of this interruption?” demanded one of the officers. “It is Jurian Hartfield,” replied Foster, “who went to Lancaster to solicit a reprieve from the executive council.” “And has he been successful?” “It would appear so.” “Where is she?” exclaimed Jurian, as they raised him from the ground. “She is reprieved, I tell you, and you commit murder in the eye of man, if you touch her life. But, O! I am too late! Ten minutes sooner, and I should have saved her! But, O God, I am too late!” “Be composed; you are not too late,” replied Foster, and Jurian gazed at him vacantly. “Be satisfied; you are not too late.” “Heaven is merciful! But where is she!” “Here, unharmed.” “That form so like to death, with all the fearful preparation for death already done!—Can it be possible that thou art saved at such a time, my Miriam!” He hurried to the cart, and threw his arms passionately around the insensible form of the poor girl, and Foster, released from his burden, removed the cord from her neck. “Look up, my Miriam; open thy eyes again, fear not, for thy friends are with you. Look up, look up; thou art saved, Miriam—I have succeeded. Dost thou not hear me?—Thou art saved.” “The dead do not hear,” said Gordon. “The dead!—It cannot be! Awake, thou injured one. Speak to me. Move but thy hand—give any sign that life is not yet extinct.” “The dead can make no sign,” continued the other. “Fiend in the shape of man, what meanest thou?” “I said, I should not die alone,” replied Gordon, “and you see my words are verified.” “Dead!—she is not dead. O no, I feel her warm breath upon my cheek, and her heart still beats, though faintly. Wretch, that savage triumph will be denied you. Look, Foster, she revives; her eyes art partly open—and here, feel her hand; it still glows with the warmth of life, and does not feel as the touch of one that's dead.” Foster took her hand and pressed it in his own for a moment, and as he relinquished it, it fell languidly by her side, and he was silent. “Why do you not speak?” continued Jurian. “Is not the warmth of life there? She has only swooned from terror. That was not the touch of death. Speak, Foster, speak.” “There is no hope,” said Foster. “She is dead.” “Dead! It cannot be that she is dead!” he exclaimed, in a tone of bitter anguish. “She is dead!” shrieked Alice, catching the words 18* of her son, and who had witnessed the foregoing, in an agony of mind little short of madness. “Yes, she is dead,” repeated Gordon, “and I do not die alone.” “Is this a time to triumph?” “Remember, sir,” he continued, addressing Jurian, “there was a way to have saved her, but you refused, and took your own course. Behold her now.” Jurian frantically called upon the name of Miriam, and being satisfied that the vital spark was extinct, he burst into an agony of tears. The body was taken from his arms by Foster, and removed to the spot where Alice and M`Crea were standing, and a vehicle being procured, Jurian and his parents left the scene of death, bearing the remains of Miriam with them. Gordon now stood alone in the cart. A breathless silence prevailed throughout the crowd, and the hymn again ascended. “Gordon, you forgive me?” said the executioner. “I do.” He then waved his hand—the cart moved, and as the criminal felt it receding, he sprang into eternity, and a shriek of horror arose from the crowd. Nicholas watched the body until it ceased to struggle. A few moments and all was over—when the shrill notes of a bugle were heard, and he hastily disappeared, and others, who had been hovering closely around the gallows, followed him. Madge also withdrew as soon as she beheld the consummation of her treachery, and the concourse slowly dispersed, each to his worldly avocation, and the revolting exhibition, which the law allows under the name of a salutary warning, was only remembered as a holyday recreation. They had witnessed the violent death of a human being, and found it no such awful matter as imagination had pictured.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. Non est cantandum, res vera agitur. —Juv. Sat. IV. While the American forces encountered an unbroken series of privation in their quarters at Valley Forge, the British were enjoying every luxury within the walls of a well built city. Their amusements were better suited to times of peace than war, and frequently the sun arose, and beheld the orgies yet unfinished, that had commenced at his setting the preceding day. Major M`Druid was almost a daily guest at 'squire Morton's table, and belonging to that class who make love from habit to every female that accident may throw in their way, he said innumerable fine things to Miss Rebecca, but without committing himself, or arriving at any definite conclusion. The spinster manœuvred to draw forth a formal declaration of his passion, but the major was too old a bird to be taken with chaff, and when she imagined that she had dexterously driven him into a corner, he would dart off at a tangent, and be perfectly free, before she could discover by what means he had evaded the net. The major possessed great volubility of tongue, and as his ideas flowed rapidly, he would traverse the four quarters of the globe, and pay a visit to the centre; commence with Adam and Eve, take you through the flood, and be present at the building of Babel, then dart off among the Greeks, Trojans, and Scythians—lead you through the fall of empires in safety, and shed the light of noonday upon the darker ages, and all this while drinking a glass of wine, and without leaving a solitary idea upon the mind of the hearer. Volubility of tongue is a great blessing, when a man wishes to evade an unpleasant question. While affairs stood thus between the major and Miss Buckley, Balcarras prosecuted his suit to Miss Morton with zeal, though she constantly urged him to banish it, as it was hopeless, but instead of following her advice, he became more earnest to convince her of the impossibility of living without her. How circumscribed is the lover's world, and how thinly peopled! `Music is the food of love,' says Shakspeare, and the colonel cried, `play on.' Accordingly, the neighbourhood in which Agatha resided was not permitted to be at peace of nights for the drone of bagpipes, and other more melodious instruments. “Plague take the fellow,” the 'squire would exclaim, “he is become a downright nuisance with his serenades; and because he cannot sleep himself, he imagines he is at liberty to keep the whole town awake.” Music certainly has a more heavenly influence at the dead of night than at any other hour, but the 'squire did not relish being startled from his first sleep, after a debauch, to listen to it, for not one time in ten would the singing in his head accord with the pitch-note of the bagpipe. Balcarras, however, paid little regard to the comforts of the 'squire, and most heroically devoted the whole winter in endeavouring to fiddle himself into the affections of Agatha. Sir William Howe, being dissatisfied at not receiving such reinforcements as he deemed necessary for the speedy termination of the war, and the ministers, on their part, complaining of a want of energy in his military career, tendered his resignation, which was accepted, and sir Henry Clinton, who was appointed in his place, arrived at Philadelphia on the 8th of May, 1778. To grace the departure of their late commander, the officers of the army prepared a brilliant entertainment, which they called the Mischianza, and which was perhaps the most splendid triumph ever bestowed upon a hero for victories never won. The fete began at four in the afternoon of the 18th of May, by a grand regatta on the Delaware, consisting of three divisions, a galley and ten flat boats in each, dressed out in a variety of colours and streamers. In the front of the whole were three flat boats with bands of music, and six barges rowed about each flank to keep off the swarm of boats that covered the river from side to side. In the stream, opposite the centre of the city, the Fanny armed ship, magnificently decorated, was placed at anchor, and at some distance lay the Roebuck, with the admiral's flag hoisted at the foretopmast head. The transport ships, extending in a line the whole length of the town, appeared with colours flying, and crowded with spectators, as were also the wharves and houses on the shore. The signal being given, the three divisions rowed slowly down, preserving their proper intervals, and keeping time to the music that led the fleet. Agatha was of the party on board the Cornwallis galley that brought up the rear, and a slight flush on her pallid cheek indicated the exhilarating influence of the scene. Many bright eyes grew brighter in the group of beauty by which she was surrounded, and `grim visag'd war had smooth'd his fearful front,' for even the rugged features of old Knypthausen, who was on board, were twisted into something that approached the caricature of a smile. He felt that it was the most poetic passage of his life, for even the dullest life has its poetic passages, and though some are so happily constituted, that a bright day, or a solitary sail by moonlight, on the bosom of some sequestered lake, will call forth thoughts that are not of this world, yet there are others of so sluggish a temperament, that it requires the bursting of a volcano, or the din of battle, to convince them that they are not composed entirely of earth. Still there was one on board that galley, who witnessed the bright display with a cold eye and an unchanged countenance. He looked inward for his thoughts, and not upon external objects, if we except the delicate form of Agatha. It was Jurian. The procession having passed the Fanny, a signal was made from one of the boats ahead, and the whole lay upon their oars while the music played God save the King, and three cheers given from the vessels, were returned by the multitude on shore. By this time the flood tide became too rapid for the gallies to advance, they were therefore abandoned, and the company disposed of in the several barges. While this change was being made, the officer who presided at the council board, on the night that Jurian was deluded by Gordon, stood for a moment in front of him, and their eyes met. “Is it possible,” exclaimed the officer, “that I find you among us at last?” “Among you, but not of you.” “Then why are you here? Mere curiosity could not have induced you to take so rash a step?” “I came in search of you, sir.” “Make known your wishes.” “Not now; it is neither time nor place. When this parade is over, shall we meet?” “Certainly, if you desire it. But pardon me, if I doubt my being the sole object of your visit here,” replied the officer, at the same time casting a look towards Agatha, who had taken her seat in the barge. “Well, then, perhaps I had an additional motive,” replied Jurian, “for I would see her too.” “Then why delay speaking to her, since she is at hand?” “I would not have the eyes of the world witness our meeting, nor yet our parting. Nor would I, from mere selfishness, disturb the pleasure that this gay scene may afford her.” “You are right; I have heard your story since our last interview, and think it prudent not to interrupt her present enjoyment. Will you descend to the barge? There is still room.” “I will follow in the next, lest she discover me.” “Do so. You will see me again, when we reach the place of landing.” The respective barges having received their freight, the procession proceeded to the landing place at the old Fort, a little south of the city line. As soon as the barge that contained general Howe was seen to push for the shore, a salute of seventeen guns was fired from the Roebuck, and after some interval, the same number from the Vigilant. The company, as they disembarked, arranged themselves into a line of procession, and advanced through an avenue formed by two files of grenadiers, and a line of light hourse supporting each file. This avenue led to a square lawn, railed in and prepared for a tournament, according to the customs and ordinances of ancient chivalry. Each side of the lawn was lined with military. The procession moved through the centre of the square, preceded by music, consisting of all the bands of the army. In front of the avenue appeared sir Harry Colder's house, bounding the view, through a vista formed by two triumphal arches, erected at proper intervals in a line with the place of landing. Two pavilions, in the form of amphitheatres, in which were rows of benches rising one above another, and serving as the advanced wings of the first arch, received the ladies, while the gentlemen ranged themselves on each side. On the front seat of each pavilion were placed seven young ladies, dressed in Asiatic habits, and wearing in their turbans the favours with which they meant to reward the several knights who were to contend in their honour. These arrangements were scarce made when the sound of trumpets was heard at a distance, and a band of knights, dressed in ancient habits of white and red silk, and mounted on grey horses, richly caparisoned in trappings of the same colours, entered the lists attended by their esquires, on foot. They were accompanied by four trumpeters, properly habited, and their trumpets decorated with small pendant banners—a herald in his robes of ceremony, and on his tunic was the device of his band, two roses entwined with the motto, `we droop when separated.' A low murmur throughout the crowd signified their admiration. Lord Cathcart, superbly mounted, appeared as the chief of these knights, and two young slaves with sashes and drawers of blue and white silk, wearing large silver clasps around their necks and arms, their breasts and shoulders bare, held his stirrups. Two esquires, one bearing his lance, and the other his shield, walked on either side of his horse. Then came in order the knights of this band, each attended by his esquire, bearing his lance and shield. They made the circuit of the square, and saluted the ladies as they passed before the pavilion, and then ranged themselves in a line with that in which were the ladies of their device. “A brilliant spectacle, indeed!” exclaimed the officer, to whom we have several times referred, and who now stood beside Jurian, near the pavilion in which Agatha was seated. “Would not your heart swell with pride to be in the lists, and have so many bright eyes looking on in admiration?” “If they were the lists of death, I should indeed wish to be there,” replied Jurian, “but I am not ambitious to add another unmeaning scene to the farce of life.” “Thou art a strange being, if such a display cannot awaken a sense of pleasure.” “I came not here for pleasure.” They were interrupted by the herald advancing into the centre of the square, and after a flourish of trumpets, proclaiming the following challenge: “The Knights of the Blended Rose, by me, their herald, proclaim and assert that the ladies of the Blended Rose, excel in wit, beauty, and every accomplishment, those of the whole world; and should any knight or knights be so hardy as to dispute or deny it, they are ready to enter the lists, and maintain their assertions by deeds of arms, according to the laws of ancient chivalry.” “There is surely no one present rash enough to accept the challenge,” said Balcarras to Miss Morton, “since you are of the Blended Rose.” “Rather of the White Rose, my lord,” she replied, “or my mirror is treacherous.” “Impossible! For even a Dutch looking-glass that would operate as a paralytic stroke upon the face of Venus fresh from the sea, could not fail to reflect perfect beauty, if you were to smile upon it.” “But if I did not smile, how then?” “Then from the bottom of my heart do I pity the poor mirror, for I know how painful a task it is to endure your frowns.” At the third repetition of the challenge, the sound of trumpets was heard from the opposite side of the square; and another herald, with four trumpeters dressed in black and orange, galloped into the lists; he was met by the herald of the Blended Rose, and after a short parley, they both advanced in front of the pavilions, when the black herald ordered his trumpets to sound, and thus proclaimed defiance to the challenge: “The Knights of the Burning Mountains present themselves here, not to contest by words, but to disprove by deeds, the vainglorious assertions of the Knights of the Blended Rose; and enter the lists to maintain that the ladies of the Burning Mountains are not excelled in beauty, virtue, or accomplishments, by any in the universe.” VOL. II.—19 He then returned to the post of the barrier through which he had entered, and shortly after the Black Knights, attended by their 'squires, rode into the lists, preceded by four trumpeters and the herald, on whose tunic was represented a mountain sending forth flames. After they had rode round the lists and made their obeisance to the ladies, they drew up fronting the White Knights, and the chief of these having thrown down his gauntlet, the chief of the Black Knights, who was dressed in a magnificent suit of black and orange silk, and mounted on a black managed horse, with trappings of the same colours as his own dress, directed his 'squire to take up the gauntlet. The knights then received their lances from their 'squires, fixed their shields on their left arms, and making a general salute to each other, by a graceful movement of their lances, turned round to take their career, and encountering in full gallop, shivered their spears. In the second and third encounter they discharged their pistols, in the fourth they fought with their swords, and finally the two chiefs, spurring forward into the centre, engaged furiously in single combat, till the marshal of the field rushed in between them, and thus proclaimed aloud:— “The fair damsels of the Blended Rose and Burning Mountains, are perfectly satisfied with the proofs of love and the signal feats of valour given by their respective knights, and command them, as they prize the future favours of their mistresses, that they instantly desist from further combat.” The chiefs, like true knights, paid immediate obedience to this order, and rejoined their respective bands. The White Knights and their attendants filed off to the left, the Black Knights to the right, and after passing each other, at the lower side of the quadrangle, moved up alternately, until they approached the pavilions of the ladies, when they gave a general salute. 'Squire Morton, who was by no means among the least interested of the spectators, as the tournament ceased, exclaimed to his sister-in-law, in whose bosom the ashes of romance began to glow— “What do you think of all that, Becky? Is there any thing in the whole course of your reading to be compared with it? Come, rummage your lumber-room, and let us have your ideas on the subject.” “Really, brother, I remember but one scene of the kind, that with reason may be brought in comparison with it.” “And what is that, Becky; what is that?” “The celebrated attack, sir, of the chivalrous Don Quixote upon the wind-mill,” replied the spinster, gravely. “You were a born idiot, Becky, and what is very remarkable, with all your learning you have not made the discovery yet.” “For shame, brother!” A passage being made between the two pavilions, the knights, preceded by their 'squires and bands of music, rode through the first triumphal arch, and arranged themselves to the right and left. This arch, which was erected in honour of lord Howe, presented two fronts in the Tuscan order, the pediment was adorned with various naval trophies, and at the top was the figure of Neptune, with a trident in his right hand; in a nich on each side stood a sailor, with a drawn cutlass, and three plumes of feathers were placed on the summit of each wing. A wide extended avenue, lined on each side with a file of troops, and the colours of the different regiments planted at proper distances, led to the second triumphal arch. Between the colours the knights and their attendants took their stations. The bands continued to play, and the company moved forward in procession, with the ladies in the Turkish habits in front; as these passed they were saluted by their knights, who then dismounted and joined them, and in this order they entered a beautiful garden that fronted the mansion, through the second triumphal arch, of the Tuscan order, and dedicated to the general. On the top of this arch stood the figure of Fame; on the right hand pillar was placed a bomb-shell, and on the left a flaming heart. From the garden they ascended a flight of steps, covered with carpets, which led into a spacious saloon, decorated in a style of splendour more befitting Asiatic luxury than the simplicity of the new world. Here the company partook of a variety of refreshments, during which time the knights came in, and on their bended knees received their favours from their respective dames, and thus were rewarded for that prowess in the mimic joust that fortune had denied them on the field of battle. While these fantastic ceremonies were going forward, the officer already alluded to, approached Jurian, and said— “I have now a few moments leisure, sir, and feel impatient to hear your commands. Let us retire to another apartment, where we may be less liable to interruption.” They withdrew, and as soon as they were alone, and the door closed, Jurian addressed him— “I have come, sir, to redeem a pledge that I once placed in your hands, and though it has become somewhat tarnished since I parted with it, and is now of little value to its owner, still I will redeem it.” “What pledge? You speak in riddles.” “I mean my honour. When it was of value, I bartered it away for dross, and now that it is worthless, I return the price received, and cancel the obligation between us. Here, sir, is your due.” Saying which, he handed a purse to the officer, who looked at him in amazement. “I promised, when we last parted, that the money should be returned, and I have kept my word.” “Thou singular being,” exclaimed the officer, “and was it for this that you have come among us?” “It was, but not for this alone. Here, take the purse.” “Nay, keep it; it is of little moment to me, and I cannot think of receiving it again, knowing the deceit that was practised on you.” “True, it may be of little moment to you, but it is of less to me, and as you were instrumental in my degradation, I demand it as an act of justice that you receive it again.” “I readily enter into your feelings, and respect them too highly, to wound them longer by opposing your wishes.” “Thank God,” exclaimed Jurian, as he handed him the purse, “that black account is closed. It has been as the spot of leprosy on my soul, and though there is no cure, still there is some relief, in feeling that I am no longer a bartered slave.” “Why suffer your morbid feelings to picture your condition in such gloomy colours?” Is there a mantle too inky for me to wear! But no matter. I am about to ask a favour, and as you conferred one that destroyed me, you will not deny another, which, under different circumstances, would prove a curse also. I wish to leave the country, and as sir William Howe will sail in a day or two, I would obtain a passage on board his ship, if possible.” “You would leave the country? Then you have changed your opinion, and now consider the present struggle hopeless?” “My opinion is still the same; the war cannot end until the country is free; and when the spirit of order shall move through the chaos that now prevails, and reduce it to a shape, posterity will look back to our present struggles with the enthusiasm of the Greeks to the Persian war; will date the era of their greatness from the American revolution, and mark out the Marathon 19* and Platæa in this hemisphere, where their liberty was purchased with the price of blood.” “The ardour of your enthusiasm, I perceive, has not abated. But if such be the destiny of the colonies, why do you abandon them at a time when, as you imagine, they are about to take their place among the nations of the earth?” “Because I should here feel as a slave among the free. I would go where my name and my shame are unknown.” “Reflect, before you adopt a course so rash. There are still ties to bind you to your native land, that may not be idly broken.” “There is one, and one only. Still that must be broken.” “What, though her heart be broken in the effort? I have already said that I am acquainted with your story, and her's even a less observant eye than mine may plainly read. The winter has been one uninterrupted scene of gaicty, and she mingled in it, yet partook not of it. Her ears have been hourly greeted with adulation from the lips of the most courtly, and she heeded it not. Fortune and distinction have combined to wean her thoughts from you, and she has turned from them to endeavour to discover a star of hope in the gloomy future. Then how can you talk of abandoning a being so devoted?” “That I may not imitate the tyrant of old,” replied Jurian, “and chain the living body to the dead. Think you that would be a proof of the holy love I bear her, and a just return for her matchless constancy? No; rather let me go where my name may never again reach her ears, and she may cease to think of me as among the living until other thoughts shall have effaced the remembrance of her present sorrows.” “Why this is absolute despair. I thought you possessed of a mind that would rise superior to any human affliction. For shame! Even the card by which you gained admission here should have taught you hope. Look at it again.” “A gay card,” said Jurian, taking the ticket. “Here is a view of the sea, with the setting sun, and in the wreath a motto:—`Luces decedens aucto splendore resurgam.' True, the mighty and mysterious movements of the planetary systems are calculated to elevate the mind from the grovelling thoughts of this world, but my sun is set, never to rise again.” “This is womanish.” “The stoutest bow may be bent until its elasticity is destroyed. You have not yet said whether you will comply with my wishes?” “If to-morrow you continue in the same mind, I will endeavour to procure you a passage. But, hark! the company move towards the ball-room. Shall we join them?” Jurian bowed assent, and they entered a spacious apartment decorated for the ball, which was begun by the knights and their ladies, and such was the exciting influence of the scene, that even 'squire Morton, in spite of the gout, attempted to lead his antiquated sister-in-law through the mazes of the dance. Agatha moved like a sylph, and though all eyes followed her in admiration, yet the sad expression of her countenance denoted that her mind partook not of the enlivening spirit that prevailed. Jurian stood in the crowd, and the only object that his eye rested upon in that vast assemblage, was the light and delicate form of Agatha. He heard not the enlivening notes that set the puppets in motion. The taste and skill that had decorated the scene was lost on him, and the gay knights, whose presence carried back the imagination to the days of romance and chivalry, moved before him unseen. His mind was chained to one thought, that operated as the spell of his evil genius that defied the influence of all others to weaken. Agatha's eye caught his figure as she moved through the dance, and he hastily changed his position. The windows were now suddenly thrown open, and a display of fireworks was exhibited, equally various and beautiful, towards the conclusion of which, the interior part of the triumphal arch, dedicated to general Howe, was illuminated amidst an uninterrupted flight of rockets and bursting of baloons. The military trophies on each side assumed a variety of transparent colours; the shell and flaming heart on the wings sent forth Chinese fountains, and Fame appeared at top, spangled with stars, and from her trumpet blowing in letters of light—`Thy laurels shall never fade.' It is remarkable that, notwithstanding this flattering promise, that trumpet has been mute on the subject ever since. A sauteur of rockets bursting from the pediment, concluded the feu d'artifice. The magical illusion that had prevailed throughout the entertainment, was kept up to the last. As the clock struck twelve, large folding doors, hitherto artfully concealed, were suddenly thrown open, and discovered a magnificent and extended saloon, from which came an overpowering stream of light, from countless tapers, lustres, and mirrors. Tables were spread profusely with the various luxuries of the old and new world, and that nothing might be wanting to assist in deluding the imagination into the belief that it was but a dream of oriental splendour, upwards of forty black slaves in eastern costumes, with collars and bracelets, were ranged in two lines, and they bent their bodies to the ground as the company descended from the hallroom to the saloon. This assemblage of gay objects combined, and bursting thus unexpectedly into view, formed a scene magnificent beyond description, and thus they put a brilliant close to the unsuccessful campaign of sir William Howe. This was a piece of dramatic art that they acquired while enacting at the South street Theatre—it is a good rule, and should be strictly observed, to enable the principal actor to make his final exit amidst three rounds of applause. As the company descended, Balcarras approached Agatha, with the view of escorting her to the saloon. “I can undergo no more,” she faintly said. “Will this fantastic display never have an end! My spirits are overpowered; my brain reels, and the atmosphere is so close that I can scarcely breathe.” “Allow me to conduct you to the fresh air; the night breeze will revive you.” “Call my brother.” “He is at the further extremity of the saloon, and the crowd is so great that some time may elapse before I can reach him. Why not allow me to wait upon you?” “I would not take you from this scene of pleasure.” “It ceases to be such to me when you are absent.” “This is folly, my lord, or worse, as you know my thoughts. Pray, call my brother, and I will here await his coming.” Balcarras withdrew to attend to her commands, and as the crowd dispersed, Jurian was seen standing at a short distance from Agatha, with his eyes fixed intently upon her. She turned and beheld him. “That figure there again!” she exclaimed. “It has haunted me throughout the day, and has so bewildered me, that I doubt whether I am in my senses, or dream. What can it mean!” “I have sought this moment for hours,” said Jurian, approaching, “and there is no time to lose. Agatha, we meet again.” “That voice! Jurian! can it be!” “Well may you doubt the evidence of your own senses, when you behold a wretch so changed.” “Changed, indeed, since even I questioned your identity. More than once have my eyes caught a glimpse of you in the crowd, but not dreaming of meeting you here, or seeing you thus, I knew not what to make of the strong resemblance, and I began to fear that the excitement of the day had bewildered my brain.” “Heaven grant that no greater excitement ever bewilder you! I would speak to you alone, Agatha, but one word; yet, I would have no other hear that word.” “Lead me to the open air, where I may breathe more freely, and you speak without fear.” “Ay, in the open air, where the countless eyes of heaven may look down upon us—that is well—but no other eye.” “What means this! Are you mad!” “Not now, Agatha, not now. True, my life has been little better than a madman's dream, but whips and scourges have at length awakened me to reason. Come to the open air, where we may breathe more freely, with the bright face of heaven before us.” She leaned on his arm and they left the hall, then crossed the garden, and proceeded in silence until they reached the triumphal arch nearest the mansion, which was now deserted. “Here let us pause,” said Agatha. “How brightly the stars shine, and how refreshing the breeze as it comes from the water.” “We have before us the placid splendour of heaven, the inviting beauties of earth in spring, and the ostentatious display that man puts forth to magnify his insignificance. Nature and art have combined to awaken the most grateful feelings, and yet in the midst of all this fascination, the darkest moment of my life has come.” “Wherefore the darkest?” “Because I am now about to tear out the last human tie from my bosom—the last and deepest rooted. There is no tie so sacred but that it may be broken. If it survive the changes that all hearts are prone to, still death will come in at last and sever it. Parents pass to their graves, are mourned for a season, and no matter how tenderly beloved, in time their loss is remembered without pain. Kindred who were nourished at the same breast, slept in each others' arms from infancy, and whose joys and griefs were the same, are frequently doomed to separate as widely as this globe can part them. The conjugal tie, the purest and strongest that the heart can conceive, often becomes as a spider's web, when death has removed the object beloved. The grave soon drinks up the tears of the mourner, and grief gives place to thoughts and feelings better suited to the living.” “Whither does this tend?” “When I am gone, Agatha, I would have you think of me as of one that's dead.” “When thou art gone!” “I have said that our grief for the departed soon subsides, and if you needs must grieve when we are separated, let the next smile you meet dry the tear.” “But our grief for the living knows no cure.” “They may be unworthy of your sorrow. I came to breathe but one word, and my heart clings to it, and my tongue refuses to utter it. Still it must be spoken, though it tear asunder all connexion with this world. Agatha—thou earliest and last beloved!—farewell!” “Jurian!” “And forever!” “Thou wilt not leave me! Thou canst not! There is now no bar between us.” “One that we may not pass. I would not doom you to a life of blighted hope with a wretch proscribed. No, Agatha, a bright world is before you, enjoy its sunshine, and leave the shade to me.” Young Morton was heard calling the name of Agatha. “Your brother's voice. I must be brief. Throw me from your thoughts, Agatha, as a thing unworthy to be remembered. Look upon what has past as a dream that could never be realized, and thank heaven that it was nothing but a dream.” “Agatha! Agatha!” again shouted young Morton. “They come. Let no mortal eye witness this parting. One kiss, as cold and holy as that which an anchorite bestows upon the skull that reminds him of his doom. 'Tis done. Again, farewell!” The voice of young Morton was again heard, and Jurian shouted, “Agatha is here.” “Do not leave me yet,” she feebly said, as she threw herself on his neck. “We meet no more in this world.” He pressed her yielding form in an agony to his bosom, and then placed it on the pedestal of the arch. He imprinted another kiss on her pale forehead, and cried— “Ho! there, Agatha is here.” He theu hurried from the spot, and immediately after young Morton and Balcarras approached, and discovered where she lay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. — Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history. As You Like It. The morning after the splendid entertainment of which we have attempted a description, the gallant ship that was to bear sir William Howe across the Atlantic, hauled out into the stream, ready for the voyage. She was as trim as a fair belle upon her first entrance into the fashionable world, and to pursue the simile, your fashionable dame, when her race is run, may be compared to the tempest-tost vessel, after a tedious voyage. Boats were plying between the shore and the ship, and on the deck and aloft all hands were busily employed. Sir William Howe was already on board, and Jurian stood upon the deck, taking a last melancholy look at his native land. Near him stood the officer to whose friendly interference he was indebted for his passage, tracing in silence the effect of his feelings upon his pale visage. At length he said— “The time is fast approaching, when the land to which you are so fondly attached will fail from your sight, and perhaps forever.” “Would it were already come,” he replied, but still kept his eyes fixed upon the scene of his childhood. “Do you not begin to repent of your rash determination? VOL. II.—20 Your looks betray the feelings of a child while watching by the death-bed of a parent.” “Still the child survives those feelings. The strongest grief is not immortal.” “Since you are resolved,” continued the officer, here is a man who came on board with me, this morning, for the purpose of taking a parting leave.” Jurian turned, and beheld M`Crea. “Why is that man here?” “He came under the protection of a flag,” replied the officer, “to recover a lost son.” “He should have thought of that sooner.” “You will not desert him in his old age?” “He deserted me in my youth. All human ties originate either in interest or gratitude, and my heart recognises towards him neither the one nor the other.” “Though I am rejected,” said M`Crea, “remember, Jurian, there are those who have been to you more than parents—and have you the cruelty to embitter the remnant of their lives, after all their kindness?” “While I breathe I shall remember them with gratitude, and shall not cease to pray for their happiness even when I forget to pray for my own. Tell them this, and conjure them, if they can, to forget me. My mind is fixed. Farewell.” “You shall not go alone, my son,” cried M`Crea. “I will accompany you.” “And by your presence keep the wound still bleeding! No; stay where you are, for there is much that I would forget, that your presence would only serve to keep fresh in my memory.” He did not turn his eyes towards his father as he spoke, but continued looking intently in the direction of the city. “Why is it that you do not even look at me,” said the humbled M`Crea, “but appear to feel deeper regret in parting from those walls than from a father?” “They awaken the remembrance of many joyful hours passed within them, but when I turn to you, sir, no page is presented that the heart of a son would wish to persue again. Leave me, and do not again interrupt the melancholy enjoyment of the few moments that remain.” M`Crea wiped a tear from his eyes, and turned away to conceal his emotion, while Jurian continued looking towards the city. A boat at this time rowed along-side of the ship, and 'squire Morton, his daughter, and Miss Rebecca ascended to the deck. They were accompanied by another boat, containing Balcarras and M`Druid. “Here am I on shipboard again,” exclaimed the old 'squire, hobbling about the deck; “I have not been off terra firma these twenty years, but I could not resist wishing the general a God speed you, on the very plank that bears him from us.” “And your fair daughter, I perceive, is as loyal as yourself,” replied the officer, who came forward to welcome him. “Either loyalty or female curiosity induced her to accompany me,” exclaimed the 'squire, “but I doubt it is the latter. But where is the general? I must trouble him with a few packages to my correspondents in London, for though we live at the world's end, it is necessary to remind them occasionally that we are not quite out of the world yet.” “He is in his cabin, sir, and will be at leisure in a few moments.” “Why do you droop, Agatha?” continued the 'squire, addressing his daughter. “Come, rally your spirits; all things should be joyous in spring, when nature puts on her holyday dress to please us. Come, cheer up, my child.” “The revelry of yesterday still hangs as a cloud upon her spirits,” replied Balcarras. “Zounds, boy, how can that be,” exclaimed the 'squire, “since it has driven every thing like a cloud from mine? There has not been such a spectacle since the coronation of his majesty. I admit I felt a little smoky about the brain when I arose, but that I attribute altogether to the infernal caterwauling that you and your bagpipers kept under my windows about daybreak. A serenade is bad enough at any time, but it should be an indictable offence to turn a tune before sunrise under any sober citizen's window, who has been up till four upon a frolic.” “Talking of serenades, brother.” said Miss Buckley, “there was a custom among the ancient Chaldeans—” “Bury the Chaldeans, Becky,” exclaimed the 'squire, “and so deeply, that they may never rise again to haunt me here. What have I done, that I should be eternally persecuted by them!” He then turned to the officer, and demanded whether any of his acquaintance designed making a voyage to England. “There stands a gentleman to whom you are possibly known,” replied the officer, pointing at Jurian, who still stood in the forecastle, with his face towards the city. 'Squire Morton approached him, and Agatha, trembling, hung upon his arm. The old man turned upon his heel as he recognised Jurian. “I understood that you were acquainted,” said the officer, affecting not to perceive the change in the 'squire's deportment. “True, I have seen the boy before, and did hope that it was for the last time.” “Father you hear he is about to leave us.” “The sooner the better; the sooner the better!” “Why is it sir,” said Jurian, “that you retain your rancour to the last? What have I been guilty of to excite this animosity? Have I ever wronged you, or ever departed from that respect which your years were entitled to? If so, it has been when you have spurned me in your pride, and awakened a momentary sense of honest indignation. I am humbled now, and ask you to forget it, for though I leave but few friends behind me, I would leave no enemy.” “When the ocean flows between us, all will be forgotten,” replied the old man. “Father, you loved him in his boyhood,” said Agatha. “You must remember the delight you took in tracing the gradual development of his mind, and how often have you exclaimed, that he was a boy to be proud of! You were happy in having him daily with you, until he appeared on the footing of a companion, in spite of the disparity of years.” “True, he was a boy of promise,” said the 'squire, in a milder tone. “Has not that promise been realized?” continued Agatha. “Is he not the man that you predicted? And if so, what is it has changed your feelings towards him?” “His presumption.” “True, I presumed to love your child,” replied Jurian, “but my passion was as pure as that which your own heart has conceived for her. Freed from every thought that the disembodied spirit need reject, when ascending to render in its last account. But before you condemn, reflect, sir, who it was encouraged me to presume. Your praises first taught me to know myself. You unfolded to me the acquirements of a life of experience and study, and taught me to know the world, at an age when it would have been bliss to have remained in ignorance. It was you who first kindled the spark of ambition in my bosom, and roused me to disdain the humble sphere in which destiny had placed me.” “I acknowledge the folly, and have since had cause to repent of it.” “You knew the human heart,” continued Jurian, “and yet allowed me unrestrained intercourse with that fair being, at a time when no worldly calculation could enter our minds, to check the ardour of our hopes. We were reared together from infancy. The 20* distinction that the world has since taught me exists between us, was not then recognised. We met as equals, and little thought that the world would pronounce it presumption in me, and degradation on her part, to love. “I have been to blame.” “I need not advert to the injustice of proscribing me for errors not my own, for you are too prejudiced to call it injustice, and whether the merciless decree be right or wrong, is now of little moment, for I go where my name and history are unknown; still it would be a satisfaction to learn, whether your mind was poisoned against me—for she says you loved me once—by my conduct, or by the stain upo me, for which another must answer? Why do you turn from me, sir?” “It is true, Jurian, that I did love you once,” replied the old man, with suppressed emotion. “Then what have I done to forfeit your esteem? I admit that I have been guilty of both folly and crime, but your heart was closed against me, before I was conscious of either. Tell me your grievance. This may be our last meeting, and before we part, I would awaken, if possible, some feeling in the bosom that loved me in my childhood.” “You have succeeded,” he replied, extending his hand, which Jurian grasped with emotion. “Go, boy, and I shall rejoice to hear that you prosper.” “I go with a lighter heart for this,” said Jurian. “When the waters flow between us, you will be enabled to reflect dispassionately upon the injustice that has been done me, for I am no longer the moral agent that nature intended me to be. Every feature of my mind has been perverted by the arbitrary rules of man, which too frequently defeat the benevolent intents of heaven, and sit like Destiny in judgment upon their victims, whom they lash with rods of iron, to the station they have designed them to fill. You, sir, had the rod in your own hand for a time, and spared not. But it is past now, and I forgive you. Farewell.” The heart of the 'squire was mollified, and he again stretched out his hand, which Jurian grasped, and then turned to M`Crea— “Father, I have brought tears into your eyes, and sorrow to your heart, instead of smoothing the downward pathway of your life; but I regret it, and would part from you as father and son should part. Your hand. Protect my mother, and God grant that your days may close in peace.” “Shall I not accompany you?” demanded M`Crea. “I have said that I go alone,” he replied, and made a few strides towards the gangway of the ship. “Leave us not yet, Jurian, leave us not yet,” exclaimed Agatha, who had witnessed the foregoing in silence, and with intense interest. “Agatha, farewell.” “Go not yet,” she cried, seizing hold of his arm, “we must not part. Was this world designed merely for strangers to bustle in, and make a heartless journey, until they sink to the earth beneath the weight of their burden; or does it not rather become us to remove the thorns from each others' pathway, and fly on as cheerfully as the birds to their place of rest? Our lives have passed thus far together, Jurian, and it is too late to part us now.” “You should have spared me this. Other eyes are upon us, Agatha, and I would not be placed upon the rack for the amusement of the multitude. Recollect where you are; be firm, and release your hold.” “I cannot—I cannot!” “Agatha, my child,” cried her father, “is your brain turned, that you speak thus wildly?” “Not yet, father, but I fear it soon may be. I have endured much, and patiently;—I have obeyed you in all things, and have struggled to conceal from your eyes the anguish that obedience brought with it; but this last trial forces me to speak, lest my heart break.” “No more of this. Come away, my child, before your weakness betray you to greater folly.” “Father, my feelings towards him have grown with my heart from infancy, until they have become inseparable from my nature. I look back, and as far as memory can carry me, his image appears; and am I now doomed to look forward, and never hope to see it again!” “Infatuated girl!” “He has been to me more than a brother,” continued Agatha, “and can I now see him about to depart friendless, sorrow-stricken, and alone, and suppress every thing like emotion! It is not for myself I speak, for gladly would I sacrifice my own feelings to see him happy.” “And the feelings of your father too,” exclaimed the old man, “and all connected with you. Say, misguided girl, wilt thou, for a stranger to your blood, cast off your friends and kindred, and desert him in his old age, who has cherished you from your birth in the very core of his heart?” “Father, father!” “You hesitate, and still cling to him. Ingrate, I am answered. Go! And though I may not forget my lost child as readily as she has forgotten me, still the grave will prevent me from remembering long.” “O! Jurian, I have never until now heard reproaches from those lips,” said Agatha, and fell upon his neck to conceal her emotion. Her father continued— “Is this the return for all my doating fondness!— Left in my old age, worse than childless,—the remnant of my life embittered with the recollection of the ingratitude of one—and the only one that could have stung so deeply!” “Cease your reproaches, sir,” said Jurian, “for they are unmerited. She can never be guilty of the perfidy of leaving you, for since she cannot part from me without this agony, think you she could desert a father, and such as you have been? Gladly would I have prevented this trial—it would have been better for us both. I wished not to have witnessed those tears, nor would I have had other eyes behold them. But it has been ordered otherwise, and all that I could endure, I have endured. There is your child again, and may she soon cease to mourn for the loss of one who has occasioned her little else than anguish.” As he concluded, he placed the almost insensible form of Agatha in the arms of her father, who exclaimed, in amazement— “Do you not love her still, that you relinquish her?” “Too fondly—too devotedly—to condemn her to a fate so dark as mine. I would not have even my worst enemy share it, much less the being that I love. Agatha, awake! You are in your father's arms. Banish his fears, and tell him you will never leave him. Speak, Agatha.” “Father, I shall not part from you till death.” “Thou art my own child again!” exclaimed the old man, pressing her to his bosom. “But how long will she remain so?” demanded the officer, who had procured Jurian admission to the ship. “She will not part from you till death, but unless you act as a father should, that promise does not insure that you will keep her long.” “What is it that you mean?” “Can you not read it in that rayless eye and pallid cheek?” continued the officer, “or will you await until death has chilled the very fountain of life before you perceive her danger. She has abandoned all her hopes on earth for you, and cannot you make a trifling sacrifice to save a child?” “What sacrifice?” “Of pride, that would impel you to destroy her peace and your own. You would bind her for life to an empty name, and tell her to be happy. True, she has been devoted to your wishes, but look on her, and say whether you think she will obey you in that command.” The old man gazed on her pale face, as it rested on his shoulder, and tears started in his eyes, when Balcarras approached and addressed him— “Though late, let me do justice to the man I have wronged. A braver never lived, and I with reason may vouch for his chivalric sense of honour. I have loved your daughter, but since my suit is hopeless, I shall cease to molest her, and give place to one more fortunate, and perhaps more deserving.” “Brother,” said Miss Buckley, “you see even his enemies plead for him.” “He has no friends to plead for him!” sighed Agatha. “Come, old gentleman,” cried M`Druid, “do the handsome thing at once, for it is better to heal hearts any day than to break them. There was a time when you loved the lad; he has talent, you say, is brave and honourable—but then the poor fellow is unknown! Botheration, never mind that, for with those qualifications he will soon remove the objection. Look at me, sir—I am, as old Adam was, the first of my race, and the chances are even that in a few years he will be as pretty a fellow as I am.” “Jurian, come hither,” cried the old man, after a struggle. “Gladly would I have kept my daughter from you, that my ambition might have been gratified. But that dream is over, and a father's feelings return. Take her, she is thine.” “Mine! An outcast—a wanderer on the face of the earth!” “No outcast, but my son. Take her, I say, for she is thine.” “Thine, Jurian, thine,” sighed Agatha, as her father placed her in her lover's arms. “Yes, Agatha, thou shalt be mine, when reproach shall cease to pursue my name, and even your father may not be ashamed to place this treasured hand in mine—but not till then.” “Jurian!” “Not until then, Agatha; still, I have said, thou shalt be mine.” Shortly after the events related above, the British evacuated Philadelphia, and the battle of Monmouth put a brilliant termination to the campaign. Jurian abandoned the idea of leaving the country, and after remaining a short time with Agatha, he availed himself of the first opportunity of departing for the south, where he joined the army, soon became distinguished for his courage, and was rapidly promoted. He served until peace was declared, some time prior to which he was united to Agatha, with the full consent of her father, and after throwing up his commission, he pursued his profession with success and distinction. All the enjoyments that earth could proffer were spread before him, but in the midst of all, the hapless Miriam was not forgotten. There is no tie so powerful as that which binds the living to the dead. All others may be weakened in our progress through life; still, in joy or in sorrow, that link remains the same as when first riveted. No smile can dissolve it, and no tear corrode, and it increases in strength, in proportion as all others are weakened. M`Druid, after the peace, returned to Europe, and died, sword in hand, fighting against the French. The first smiling face he met removed the impression made upon his heart by the charms of Miss Buckley, but she was more constant in her attachment, and for his sake, died as true a virgin as queen Elizabeth. She, however, lived long enough to become the president of a charitable association, where she managed to get all the household linen made at half price, and receive the widows' prayers in the bargain. The old 'squire, after the peace, like many others, abandoned his tory principles, and by way of setting an example to the community, joined a temperance society. His conversion was much talked of at the time, but on examining the records of the society, I find that his name was on the sick-list until the day of his death, and that his doctor prescribed brandy, as the only medicine suited to his disease. Captain Swain lived long to enjoy the liberty he had contended for, and the prosperity of Jurian. M`Crea became an altered man, and banished from his mind his philosophical researches, and instead of studying how to live, devoted the remnant of his days in studying how to die. Alice survived the death of Miriam but a few months. Corporal Drone, after the close of the war, became a violent politician, and talked loudly in beer-houses of the services he had rendered his country “in the times that tried men's souls.” When Lafayette became the nation's guest in 1824, the corporal was one of the old soldiers who rode in the chariots that led the van of the triumphal entry into Philadelphia, and when he was afterwards introduced to the marquis in the Hall of Independence, he endeavoured to awaken some reminiscences about the battles of Brandywine, Germantown, and Swedes' Ford. The corporal's memory appeared to be more retentive than that of the other, who was pushed so closely on that memorable occasion, that at times he could afford nothing more than a bow or a smile of recognition. The corporal, we have said, was a violent politician, and more than once was he brought forward by designing partisans as a candidate for some petty office, and supported on the grounds of “revolutionary services,” but he invariably failed in his election, which caused him to inveigh more bitterly against the ingratitude of republics. He prosecuted Ephraim Horn for the reward offered for the apprehension of Gordon, and the cause having finally been removed to the Supreme Court, it remains undecided to this day, as each judge entertains his own peculiar opinion with regard to the law on the subject.
