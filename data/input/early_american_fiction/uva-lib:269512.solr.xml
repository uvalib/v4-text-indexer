      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. MY ancestors came from England. They were part of the persecuted dissenters, who sought an asylum in the wilds of America—of those enterprising few, who landed at Plymouth, in sixteen hundred and twenty. My great-grandfather, by the father's side, came over at the time I have mentioned. His name was Burlinton, though we now spell it Burlington. He professed the presbyterian religion, but it appears, from some of his papers which are now before me, that he was by no means rigid. I find that he opposed those severe rules which were drawn up for the government of the newly formed church, which they styled “The Dominion.” They enforced their laws without mercy, and without decency. None could be admitted as freemen, jurymen, or magistrates, but members of the church. In short, no office could be held by any man in the dominion, who was not a member of the church. A number of these papers appear to have been a correspondence between this gentleman and his more zealous brethren. To transcribe them all, would take up too much time, and answer no purpose, as all those who are acquainted with the history of the times of which I speak, must know too much of these lamentable truths. As a sample of those pious bigots, I will, however, copy one letter, which seems to have been written by a friend of Mr. Burlington, upon one of these renowned occasions. Salem, July 23, 1681. Dear Friend—You complain, in your last, of the violent proceedings of your town on the old subject; but it is trifling, compared to the zeal of our minister.— Though my health is little improved, since I wrote you last, yet I went to hear Mr. Williams, last Sabbath. I was shocked at the discourse; but, dear Thomas, it would cost me my life, if this were known. He raged, he stamped, he foamed at the mouth, and all this for a mere phantom—a shadow. Strange, that our teachers should set such examples of wrath. I am sure, Christ enjoins it upon us, to be meek and lowly. But I will try to give you a plain account of some of the sermon. He said that “the cross of St. George, in the English colours, was a downright popish relict; that it was Idolatry, and popish whoredom, to retain this ensign of hellish superstition.” But his language would be too tiresome to you, and withal, not edifying. So much did his discourse affect the congregation, that they held a meeting, that same evening, and passed a decree, that it should be publicly cut out of the colours, and should never be seen amongst God's people.” I am very doubtful that this is not the right way—moreover, our minister and another one, by the name of Roberts, had some very uncivil talk that same evening. This cannot be the right way—we have lost it, somehow. We are, in truth, without teachers; for I would put no more faith in this madman, Williams, than I would in Satan. It puts me in mind of a saying of Luther's friend, Mclancthon, of Wittemberg. He said “that he longed to be dissolved, and that for two reasons—first, that he might enjoy the much desired presence of Christ, and the heavenly church—secondly, that he might be freed from the cruel and implacable discords of divines.”— But I shall not, I trust, be long in this turbulent world. I am heart-sick of it. What a monster is man! Better had we remained in England:—I could laugh, there; here I dare not smile. Adieu, dear friend, &amp;c. &amp;c. 1* All this goes to show, what a horrid thing fanaticism is, when it attains any considerable degree of power.— In short, the subsequent persecutions, and arbitrary measures, adopted and pursued, by these people, entirely alienated from them the only surviving son of this old gentleman. He embraced the religion of the peaceable Quakers. His name was Thomas. He died in the prime of life, and very suddenly, leaving but two children, both of which were sons. One of them was called Charles, after his father; the other Thomas, after himself. Charles was likewise a Quaker. He pursued the mercantile business with great application and success. He married the daughter of the wealthy Mr. F—. She was his only child. By her he had four children; two sons and as many daughters. Two only survived him; a son, (myself,) and a daughter. My mother was likewise of the Quaker persuasion, and I still have a preference for that religion. Thomas, his other son, (my uncle,) was younger than my father, by nine years. He testified great displeasure at the authority exercised over him, by my father, and finally eloped on board a British sloop of war, at the age of sixteen, and went to the East Indies; where, as we heard, he died. It was reported that he fought against his native country, in the revolutionary war; but how true it was, I cannot tell. My father never saw him afterwards. He was much afflicted at this distressing circumstance, and never mentioned his name without a sigh. My father took a very active part in the revolutionary war, and was in several engagements; on which account he was excluded from the society of Quakers. At the close of the war, he removed to Boston, and continued to follow the mercantile business. He was very successful, and even might be called rich, before I was born, which was in the year seventeen hundred and eighty-seven. I was his third child. He had taken several clerks, to assist him in his counting house. Amongst these, was one whose name was Hunter, whom my father found in the streets, when a lad, naked and destitute of friends. His parents were both dead, and he was without friends, and without money, or property of any description. My father took him to his house, gave him his breakfast, clothed him, and sent him to school. When he was sufficiently qualified to write, and do business in the store, he was removed from school to the counting-house; where he conducted himself with the strictest integrity and application. I have heard my father say, often, that he was the most attentive clerk he had. When he became old enough to do business for himself, my father, who had often told him he would reward his good conduct, took him as a partner, and lent him two thousand pounds, in addition to his share of profits, as a compensation for his services. He took Hunter's bonds for the money, payable five years after date. It was agreed, between him and my father, that he should remove to New-York, where he remained several years; during which time, he had risen rapidly in the world, and still continued a partner of my father. He made several voyages to Liverpool, in the time, and supported the character of an upright, active, and persevering merchant. He had never paid my father the money advanced to him, but then he was good for it, and was ready to do so, at any time. At the age of seventeen, my father sent me to Princeton College. An old acquaintance of his father, was at that time one of the professors, which led him to prefer that College, to Yale or Harvard. At this seminary, I made but very little progress. My education had been too much neglected, in the earlier part of my life; and now, I had neither talents, application, nor taste, for literary pursuits. Born to great wealth, I looked down upon my fellow-students, with contempt. No doubt, they viewed me in the same light. History, geography, astronomy, and a very imperfect knowledge of the Latin tongue, were the amount of my literary acquirements. At Princeton, I formed an acquaintance with a Mr. Henry Wilson; the son of a wealthy Virginia planter-This young man was nearly of my own age. We resembled each other in disposition, temper, and general principles; but he was greatly my superior in talents, as well as industry in the prosecution of his studies. He was liberal, humane, and wholly untainted with pride or bigotry. In short, he possessed every virtue, and was free from every vice. But modesty was his predominant characteristic. Our acquaintance soon grew up to the tenderest and most indissoluble friendship, which has remained to this hour. In a world like this, where ingratitude, injustice, fraud, violence, and a thousand other crimes embitter-society, an acquisition of this nature is the greatest of all possible blessings. Our acquaintance was merely accidental, having arose from the circumstance of our both lodging in the same room. In the first year, Henry Wilson would often reproach me for my idleness; and this he would do, in language replete with reason and gentleness. When the Christmas holy-days approached, Wilson, with a little persuasion, wrote an excuse to his parents, and accompanied me to Boston. During our stay in that city, our time was filled up with all sorts of amusement. Balls, plays, sleighing, and those various amusements which engage the youth of both sexes, in the winter season, made the time roll merrily on. But, at length, the day came, when we were to set out for Princeton. When we came to take leave, I perceived, for the first time, symptoms of attachment between Wilson and my sister. She had just entered her sixteenth year. Her figure was not striking; it was, however, without defect. She was tall and slender; danced and sung well; her complexion fair; her eyes a dark blue. In short, she was reckoned handsome; and, even at this early age, had many admirers. But Wilson was a new lover, and this circumstance has great sway with most females. In the present instance, however, it was not a subject of much wonder, the advantages on both sides being nearly equal. It may not be improper, in this place, to mention another circumstance, which, though seemingly unimportant in itself, ultimately becomes the pivot upon which the incidents in the following sheets revolve. During my residence at college, my father had taken a new servant into his family, of the name of Horton. It appears that he had been recommended to my father, by Hunter. Although not in want of a servant, he payed that respect to his friend's recommendation, to which he conceived him entitled. I did not like this Horton. He had a dark, gloomy, designing countenance, touched with slyness and cunning; but, seeing that he was a favourite with my father, I kept my suspicions to myself, and set out with Wilson, for Princeton.</field>

I am heart-sick of it. What a monster is man! Better had we remained in England:—I could laugh, there; here I dare not smile. Adieu, dear friend, &amp;c. &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. I had been at Princeton, nearly five months, when I received a letter from my father, which overwhelmed me with astonishment and distress. It was as follows: Dear Charles—So soon as thee receives this letter, thee will proceed home without delay.—I am ruined!— All my effects were seized yesterday, to satisfy Clark &amp; Co. of Liverpool, vs. Burlington &amp; Co. I do not understand this; I am bewildered; something is wrong in this business. I did not know that I owed that house aught, except part of the last importation; but I know nothing, nor can I do any thing. Haste thee home with all speed. I am very much indisposed—thy mother is distracted; we need thy presence and assistance. The family send their greeting to thy young friend. Your distressed Father, C. Burlington. With a heart full of grief, I took leave of Wilson, and set off the same evening. When I arrived at home, I hastened to examine my father's books, and soon discovered that Hunter was at the bottom of this unaccountable plot. I found that my father had regularly remitted his share of the payments! Hunter must have kept it! Hunter must be combined with them! Hunter, I concluded, was the villain! But what was to be done, I could not devise; for the property was to be sold in forty days. The sum required was enormous—one hundred and eighty-four thousand pounds, sterling! I was horror-struck! Every thing we had, must be sacrificed. In this dilemma, we held a consultation, the result of which was, that I should take Hunter's bounds, go to him, and collect the money, if possible, or get what I could; with a view to save a few necessaries. I was to set out the next morning. In the mean time, my father called for a candle and walked into his library. After attempting to console my mother and sister, whose distress was beyond description, I stepped into the library to receive the bonds, intending to set out before day. When I approached my father, he was looking in a small trunk, seemingly unconscious of my entrance. “The bonds were enclosed here,” said he, “I saw them not long ago.” “Can't you find them, father?” “No.” I proposed to assist him, and, taking the trunk to a table, I emptied the contents on it, and then examined every paper, one by one. No bonds to be found. My father's fortitude entirely forsook him—he fainted. I called for help, and removed him to bed. As my father sunk under his misfortunes, my mother seemed to be inspired with fresh courage. She strove to reconcile him to this new calamity. “Charles,” said she, “it is the will of Providence that we should be afflicted: thee need not be cast down; remember Job.— Thy family is grown; Charles and Mary can maintain us; little will do thee and me.” My sister and myself strove to comfort him. Mary kissed him, and begged him to remember that he had enjoyed many years of felicity; and that he ought to be resigned under his present trials; but he was mute. Nothing could equal the distress I felt; but this was not the business, and despondency would avail nothing. My suspicion respecting the bonds, fell on Horton. He had quitted my father, without assigning any reason; and had left Boston, a few weeks before the property was seized. Although I had little hopes of succeeding with Hunter, yet, to gratify my father, who still retained some opinion of the man, I set out for New-York. When I made my name and business known to Hunter, he assumed a haughty distant air, and replied, “I am surprised at your father,” (raising himself with unparalleled impudence as he spoke,) “I am surprised, that he should demand a debt long since paid; but it is nothing more than I expected.” He had scarcely uttered the last word, before I seized him by the collar—“You lie, villain! nor dare to use such language of my father. You stole the bonds, and now you deny the debt.” He bawled out, “Murder! murder!” as loud as he was able. The house was filled, instantly, with people. I attempted to withdraw from it, but was seized and conveyed before a magistrate. I began, but too late, to reflect on my rashness. The wretch, thought I, will swear any thing. I have no friends here. The horrors of a jail—my father, mother, and sister—the distress they would suffer, rushed upon me at once; but I will not attempt to describe my feelings. Indeed, I was, for some time, insensible; nor would any one understand me, who has not experienced misfortunes like this. A calamity, so great, so sudden, and so unexpected, has scarcely a parallel. Hunter swore that I entered his house to maltreat him, and that I would have murdered him, had he not been suddenly and seasonably relieved. It is scarcely necessary to add, that I was committed to prison, to await my trial at the ensuing term of the city court; which was twelve days hence. I happened to have money enough to fee a lawyer who visited me in prison, and very candidly informed me that if the same evidence was, (as it certainly would be,) admitted in court, the consequence would be serious. It might be a heavy fine, and, perhaps, ten months imprisonment. What was to be done? I felt no concern for myself; but the affliction of my parents distressed me, beyond measure. I had written to them on the subject, but softened the thing as much as possible, without concealing the truth. The lawyer asked if no other person was present when the affray took place. I told him there was a servant-maid, (as I took her to be,) but what of that? Hunter would dictate to her. “We will risk it,” said he, “you cannot be worsted. Say nothing about it, when you are in court, and I will arrange it.” Accordingly, when we, Hunter, &amp;c. were called before the court, I saw my attorney send an officer out, who soon returned with the servant-maid, whom he interrogated privately. Hunter was at this time giving in his testimony, and was unapprized of her being in court. The attorney managed to keep the servant closely engaged in conversation, during Hunter's examination, so that she never heard a word of his evidence. While he was talking with the girl, I noted down the testimony of Hunter. He stated, that “Charles Burlington came into his house, fell on him, without speaking a word; beat him, and abused him with the most insolent language.” The girl was then desired to stand forth, and was sworn Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? Witness. He came to our house, week before last. Q. Did you see him enter Hunter's house? Witness. I opened the door for him, myself. Q. Did you see and hear all that passed between him and Mr. Hunter?—If you did, state what it was, to the court. Witness. Last Monday week, (this was Friday,) I was sweeping the front room, I heard a knocking at the door. I opened it, and this gentleman came in. I asked him to walk into the parlour. He refused, and asked if Mr. Hunter was at home. At that moment Mr. Hunter came in. The prisoner asked him if his name was Hunter. He answered, “It is.” “I have a letter for you—I believe from a friend of yours.” He took the letter out of prisoner's hand, and asked prisoner to be seated. He looked at the letter, and said, “I am surprised that your father should send to me for money, when he has been paid, long since; but it is just what I expected from a man of his principles.” The prisoner catched Mr. Hunter by his collar, and called him a villain. Mr. Hunter cried out, “Murder!” and called for assistance. Some men that were passing the house, ran in and seized the prisoner. Q. Were you present until the prisoner was carried out of the house? Witness. I was. Q. Were you summoned upon the first examination? Witness. I was not. Q. Did you see the prisoner strike Hunter? Witness. I did not. Q. What were you doing in this front room? Witness. I was sweeping it, as I told you, before. The testimony being got through, the charge against 2 me, was ably and splendidly supported, and I gave myself up for lost. I thought I could see ten thousand devils in Hunter's countenance; I felt the pangs of a long separation from my parents;—I felt wretched. But the attorney who defended me, had proceeded but a short way in my defence, before I conceived my innocence secure, and I felt happy. Those conflicting sensations were the effects of my inexperience, particularly of courts, and pleadings;— though I have since learned that Mr. W—, who defended me, possessed genius, eloquence, and a consumate knowledge of the law. A trifling fine, was the end of this mighty matter, and I left New-York. Upon my arrival in Boston, I found my parents in the deepest distress, on account of my absence, and confinement. My father, compelled at last to change his opinion of Hunter, gave all up for lost. The shock of this sad reverse of fortune, entirely deranged him; his vivacity forsook him—he became melancholy, and, in short, his life was despaired of. My mother had, by dint of inquiries, whilst I was at New-York, learned from the servants enough to confirm the suspicion, that Horton had stolen Hunter's bonds.— One of them, being out late one night, saw Horton coming out of the library with a lantern in his hand; but, thinking he had been sent by his master for something, never mentioned the circumstance, until it was revived in his memory by the inquiry for the bonds. Our situation was desperate. I attempted to borrow money, but the report that the firm was completely broken, had spread far and wide—no one would lend. We therefore awaited our doom in deep melancholy. We had not even the consolation of a friend—we had many of them, in our prosperity; but they all forsook us, at the time we had most need of them. The day of sale came; the property went for almost nothing. I purchased a few necessaries for the family; but they were not long needed. My father, who had been almost insensible before the day of sale arrived, died shortly after it; and my mother survived him only six months. She strove to combat fortune, while my father lived; but, upon his death, her fortitude forsook her—she gave way to her grief, and ended her sorrow in death. A few days before this best of mothers died, she called me to her, desired me to fasten the door, and set down by her. After doing as she dictated, she thus addressed me:—“My dear Charles, I feel that I shall soon leave this world.” Seeing that I began to weep, she endeavoured to comfort me—“It is no time to weep, my son; listen to my advice. Thou hast had a good lesson from the Almighty; I trust thou wilt profit by it. He has taught thee, (for it is all his doings,) how vain and transitory are all earthly things. Thy father has toiled, and laboured, to leave thee and thy sister an independence; but this displeased our heavenly Father, and it has pleased him to blow it away with the breath of his nostrils. Learn, from this, my son, what empty bubbles are wealth and honour. Alas! what can they do, in the hour of distress! But, above all things, my child, pity and relieve your fellow-creatures, when in distress—never turn away from the poor; for God hears their cry, and he will revenge it on thee. Be humble; respect the widow's tear and the orphan's cry. Remember that thy days are but very few here; lay up, therefore, your treasure in heaven, by loving mercy and walking humbly. Thou need not doubt thy Saviour's ability to save. Christ has died for thee; therefore thou canst not be lost; but I warn thee, never boast of thy piety; keep thy piety to thyself, and let that of others alone. Never run here, or run there, to hear this or that great or small preacher. Such is not true Christianity; but love god and your neighbour. True and vital religion, says St. James, is not in running to night and day meetings; it is in succouring the widow and orphan in their distress, and keeping thyself unspotted from the world. Have no connection with those people who are noted for running to church, and nothing else. I have always found them the most unfeeling, cruel, and hard-hearted of the human race. They have mistaken, they have forgot, they have entirely misinterpreted Christ's precepts. Thou wilt find, my Charles, that those religious bigots have none of the meek, kind, and loving spirit of Christ; therefore imitate them not. I have not the presumption to say why this is so; but, I think it is the fault of the clergy. So long as they can draw the people to hear them, so long can they rule them; and if they continue, they will soon be as despotic as as the Pope, and, perhaps, not half so charitable. Be not deceived by these cold-hearted, cold-blooded professors—remember what this wretch, Hunter, has done. Perhaps he never would have thought of such a black piece of treachery, had he not become a professor. I may be wrong, my son; but, if I am, I have Christ with me, that charity is the foundation and top-stone of Christianity. For the rest, my child, I cheerfully leave this world—I am not afraid to die; far from it. I long to be with Christ. And now I come to the only terrestrial consideration which interests me, at this awful moment, and that is thy sister; love her, sooth her, and comfort her, when I am gone. Distress like hers, my Charles, will need comfort. I have kept the worst concealed from her—I could not see her tears. I leave thee poor and friendless, it is true; but, he who “tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,” will be thy friend. Trust in him; he will never forsake thee; and, never, oh, Charles! never abandon thy sister; she will soon have no protector but thee.” My mother spoke with a firm, clear, and distinct voice, until she came to the last sentence. She then gave way to her tenderness, for some minutes. I pressed her hand, the only reply I was able to make. “I said thou hadst no friends; but God can raise up friends for thee, my children;—do not be cast down entirely—only rely upon thy Maker.” This was the last conversation I ever had with my mother. I happened to be from home, when she died, suddenly. When I returned, what was my anguish to find my mother a corpse, and my sister raving! She was sitting flat on the floor, her clothes and hair in great disorder—she was pale, and her eyes red with weeping. No company was with her, except a few indigent neighhours. She was insensibly leaning her head on her knees, looking at the fire, exclaiming, “My brother, oh! he will break his heart.” “Oh, no,” said I, as I entered the house, “I will live to protect you, my dear Mary.” She flew into my arms---not a word was uttered, for several minutes. Though I have since that day experienced every vicisitude of fortune, and difficulties that fall to the lot of but few; yet the bitterness, the heart-rending pangs I felt, while I pressed my afflicted sister to my breast, have never been equalled. Those, and those only, who have experienced similar calamities, will understand my feelings at that moment;—but I drop the curtain. Lament, I certainly did; but I did not abandon myself to despair. I led my sister into another room, and sat with her during that day. It required all my skill, and and all my tenderness, not to reconcile her. (that was impossible,) but to enable her to support her sufferings. In our prosperity, few families could count a more numerous, or a more respectable circle of friends; but, where they were then, I know not—none of them came near us. Not so Wilson, our friend at college. We had kept up a regular correspondence from the time I left Princeton; in consequence of which, he was informed of our misfortunes. The sympathy and kindness expressed by this truly great and generous young man, ought to redeem the human character from that obloquy which the conduct of too many has cast upon it. In answer to my letter, in which I disclosed to him this last sad blow, he addressed me as follows: Very Dear Friend—Your situation is one that admits of little relief—nothing but time can heal the wounds of the heart. But permit me to mingle my tears with yours—permit me to say that I feel for your sufferings, and that on a double account; but this is too tender a subject, and yet I cannot forbear. Dear Charles, forgive me, for in your breast alone I would repose the secret of my heart; but I dare not name it—cannot you guess, oh, dearest Charles? Write to me, quickly, and let me know. But I am raving—I sat down to console you, whilst I need consolation myself. I shall see you, at the end of the term, at all hazards—in the mean time, 2* let me know whether I may dare to hope—you understand me. Say to your sister, that her sorrows are mine. You say she weeps incessantly.—Oh, God! tell her it wounds me to the heart—never again write to me thus. Dear Charles, you have pierced my soul. Say something to relieve me.—Accept the trifle I send you, until you can make it convenient to return it. Do not let this mark of my eternal regard for you, wound your delicacy—you know my heart—you know if I were in your situation, and you in mine, that I would be proud to give you this proof of our friendship. Know, from henceforth, that what is mine is yours. Your very distressed friend, HENRY WILSON. This letter was of more value to me than the whole world. I read it to my sister—it cost her a flood of tears; but from that time her grief seemed to subside. I saw that the attachment between them was mutual. When I came to answer Wilson's letter, I asked my sister what reply I must make to that part of his letter which evidently related to her, as it was the only thing in it to which he entreated an answer. Her reply was perfectly consistent with her situation, and such as I would have dictated myself: she said that, “had fortune continued to smile upon her, Wilson would have been the man of her choice; but, poor and friendless as she now was, she could not think of accepting a man of so much worth; that her want of wealth, in a connection of that nature, would subject her to obligations which her feelings could not brook; that she was but too sensible of the honour of his esteem, and thanked him for his kind solicitude for her happiness.” This ingenuous declaration of my sister, was highly gratifying to me, and was precisely the measure that coincided with my own opinion. I therefore communicated the substance of her answer to Wilson, and concluded by asking his advice. I told him, that I must turn my attention to some calling for support, and begged him to give me his opinion. For a lawyer, I thought I was not sufficiently educated—the occupation of a clerk, appeared my only chance; but something must be decided on, as there was no time to lose. In the mean time, I sought an asylum for my sister. In her distress she had been frequently visited by the family of a Mr. Simpson who seemed to express some kindness for her. He had two daughters grown, tolerably agreeable. The old gentleman was also very respectable. It was finally agreed, that Mary should remain at Mr. Simpson's, for the present, until I could make other arrangements for her accommodation. After disposing of my sister, I collected the small remains of my father's fortune. It cost me great trouble and pains to recover small debts, that he had, in his distress, overlooked. In the whole, it amounted to eleven hundred dollars, only; which was my whole dependence. Out of this, my sister was to be supported—I determined, however, she should lack nothing, if I had to labour by the day for her support. While all this was going forward, I received a letter from Wilson, stating that his father had recently moved to Rutherford county, in Tennessee, whither he himself was to go when his time was expired at college; which would be in the course of three months; that the country he spoke of was very desirable—that it was rising fast, in reputation; the soil was rich, the climate mild and healthy, and the navigation promising every advantage to be derived from commerce; and finally, that he would insist upon my accompanying him thither. I was well pleased with this proposition, telling my sister that I should leave her in Boston, until I should visit Tennessee, and provide a place for her in that state, should her inclination lead her to make it her residence. I likewise informed her that she was to receive a visit from Wilson, and at what time. Having fixed, in my own mind, upon a plan for my future destination, I felt considerably relieved. My sister also became more tranquil. While I was busily engaged in arranging all my little matters, in order to be ready for my departure by the time Wilson arrived, I received a letter from Mr. W—, the attorney who defended me in the prosecution instituted against me by Hunter. When I left New-York, I requested Mr. W— to make all possible inquiry into the affairs of Hunter: How he stood in society? Whether the property, (meaning the store held in partnership with my father,) was sold? Not having heard from New-York previous to the death of my father, I addressed a letter to Mr. W. and empowered him to settle with Hunter.—The letter just mentiened was the answer. Sir—Agreeable to your request I waited on Mr. Hunter and demanded a settlement: he said he was ready, and forthwith we proceeded to the place where his books were kept. Upon examining the accounts between him and your father I am sorry to inform you that he brings your father in debt. Upon presenting the account you sent me, he denied the whole; and made use of language that is useless to repeat to you. I do think myself that your account is just; but you can get nothing of Hunter. The property you spoke of was sold a few days since for the benefit of “Clark &amp; Co.:” therefore Hunter is insolvent. It is thought, pretty generally, that the goods were purchased by his friends and with his own money. You ask of Hunters reputation—he has hitherto been esteemed an honest man and a fair dealer; but since your affair, he has fallen very much in the esteem of the public. It is hinted here that he laid this plan of treachery when last in Liverpool; the agent for that house says he failed for the sum for which the seizure was made. I am very sorry for your situation, and have no comfort for you but the very poor ones of patience and resignation. Should you have any farther commands in this city I will attend to them with pleasure.—Yours, respectfully, &amp;c. As this was fully expected I was less afflicted at the news; I therefore resigned myself to my fate.—The three months soon rolled round and Wilson arrived in Boston; after three days we took leave of my sister and set out for Tennessee. The parting scene between my sister and us was truly distressing: but I pass it over! We both promised to write to her often and to come for her in the course of a year or two, at farthest. We travelled the usual rout to Alexandria, and there took the stage to Abbington in Virginia; where we purchased horses and prosecuted the rest of the journey on horse-back; after a tedious journey we arrived at Wilson's father's where we were joyfully received by the old people. They had one other son, but he was not at home when we arrived: he returned, however, the next day. It seems he had been to the house of a gentleman in the neighbourhood to whose daughter he was in a short time married.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. Wilson's father was, as I have already mentioned, a Virginian. I had often heard the Virginians celebrated for their hospitality to strangers, but this was the first opportunity within my recollection, I had, of deciding. Whether the remark be true, or otherwise, I pretend not to say; certain it is that old Mr. Wilson received me with the same cordiality and friendship with which he received his son. I saw no difference: every demonstration of joy, laughter, tears, and caresses, were lavished on us, both by the father and the mother. The old gentleman seemed to be turned of fifty, and his wife proportionably old; he was all frolic and fun; told us old stories and would not hesitate to sing a song. The old lady was all chat and prattle about her geese, ducks, turkeys, grass-walks, saving seeds, the right time of the month to give the little negro children worm seed, until she lost herself in a long dissertation upon the best method of rearing calves and lambs. Often has she puzzled me to follow her in tracing the genealogy of the hundred leaved rose, and various other curious flowers. The old gentleman took great pleasure in walking over his grounds and pointing out the qualities of the different enclosures, and that one thousand con'ills would produce fo (four) barrels mo (more) “here than it will in Old Virginia, ah! and tobacco here grows primer.” He would discuss the method of rearing late and early colts, and gave me an episode upon the pedigree of the “sober Irishman,” the name of a celebrated horse which he then owned. Indeed the whole of these good people's time and talents were entirely devoted to the amusement and accommodation of their guests. I was charmed with this country; it was rich, indeed; it lies in large bodies uninterrupted by hills, marshes, stones, or any impediment. Those beautiful plains, the impenetrable cane-breaks, the numerous smooth, flowing streams gliding through lofty forests of beautiful timber, formed the most delightful regions I ever beheld; and although I have since seen countries to which this is no comparison in point of beauty and fertility, yet it left on my mind, impressions not easily to be eradicated. After resting myself a week, I proposed to Wilson a ride to Nashville to see what prospect that town afforded.— On our way thither Wilson proposed to join me in a store; he thought he would find little difficulty in persuading his father to advance the money. This proposal, though agreeable to my wishes, I informed him “was not in my power to accede to, being almost destitute of funds—that nine hundred and sixty-five dollars was all the cash I could command, and four hundred of that I owed to him, which through neglect I had not returned.” “Dont be out of heart,” said Wilson; “the money you speak of, I do not want, and if you cannot lay out your money to more advantage, throw it into the firm: you can act as clerk to my father or myself, as we may hereafter agree—your board in the mean time will cost you nothing; if you only double your money per annum it is better than nothing—cheer up,” said the kind hearted Wilson, “don't despond,” and with this conversation we reached Nashville. Nashville was, even at this early period, 1807, a very handsome town. It stands on the south bank of Cumberland river, which runs from east to west, or nearly so, at this place. Several elegant brick buildings were erected, and amongst the rest a handsome college, called Cumberland College! In short such is the beauty, activity, and commerce of this town that the whole had the appearance of magic.— Situated as it is at such an immense distance from the more civilized sections of the Union, as I may say, it will yet form, at no very distant period, doubtless, a very respectable part of it. It has a very romantic appearance, being built upon a lofty bluff, at the base of which the Cumberland river steals softly along. After making a conditional bargain for a store-house and lumber-room, and likewise for a small assortment of goods, we returned home. Wilson had been so careful of my feelings that he had not divulged a sentence of my late misfortunes to his parents. I would much rather he had done so, that I might not in any subsequent event appear to them in the light of an impostor. Upon expressing my objections to entering upon business in this disguise, he said “that if it would make any difference at all with his father, such was his generosity, that it would tend to bias him very much in my favour.” I told him that “whether it did or did not, I could by no means have any concern with the proposal without this disclosure.” It was accordingly made. The result proved Wilson's observation respecting his father to be as he had suggested. Old Mr. Wilson commended my candour as the greatest evidence I could give of upright intentions. “Keep up your spirits,” said he, “you are young and enterprising and very capable of doing business, and you shall never want assistance. Henry talks of setting up a store in Nashville and taking you in as a partner. He would be glad that I would join him. but I care nothing about it;—I told him he should have this year's cotton to try his luck; you can attend to the store and he can study law the while. I suppose he's not give that out.—I hate to pay so much money for his eddication for nothing, and it was all his mother's doings at first. Faith! it has cost me a good round sum, but as I was telling you, his mother said, “Well, old msn, we must have one great man in our family, and you know what a great man we have had a kin to us.[1] [1] Patrick Henry. Who knows but that Henry may come to be President of the United States?” “Ah, Betsey,” says I, “you are always building castles in the air. There's William,” says I to her, “oh, he was to marry Miss Tabb Nothingsurer. Well, to please her I rigs up William, that's my second son, buys him a gig and fine clothes, and like o' that, fine servant, well, off he goes to see Miss Tabb—you'll hear how it turned out, just as I expected—'bout a week here comes William, looking doleful enough—might tell as far as you could see him that he had no encouragement—I was expecting how it would be—old woman by, he gets out of the gig, comes in, if you had seen how sheepish he looked, his mother all expectation.— “Well, son, what news?” “Don't ask me about news,” says William, “The d—I may court Miss Tabb for me—as proud as h—ll; why she would hardly speak to me!” “Possible!” says my wife, “a poor pretty upstart! I can remember when her father was nothing but an overseer; and I have heard my mother say that he had to enter her house with his hat under his arm. I'll let her know that my son is as good as she.” Seeing that he paused, I asked, “if Mr. Henry Wilson still intended to prosecute the study of the law.” “Oh, I suppose he does, I never axed him about it since he come home.” But as I was tellin' you, Mrs. Wilson must have a President or Secretary of State, or some d—n nonsense. Well, to please her, I always, Mr. Burlington, have been a friend to the ladies and trys to please 'um. Well, so it was, Henry was hoisted off to Princeton, and now I suppose his—” At this part of the narrative we were fortunately interrupted by the entrance of company; to come to the conclusion, the old gentleman a few days afterwards, went with us to Nashville (telling his long stories all the way) and purchased four thousand dollars worth of goods, paying one half down, one half of which I advanced to him, to wit: nine hundred and fifty dollars. And here behold me now located in Nashville, upwards of one thousand miles distant from my sister, and the place of my nativity. Although no one had less cause to murmur at their destinies than I, yet the man who could so soon forget, the man who could so soon subduc his feelings, must possess a greater share of philosophy than I. In the hurry and application of business or conversation, my thoughts would often steal to Boston.— Such was often the case, and such was the depth of those impressions, that neither the charms of society, nor the bustle of business could enable me to resist those intrusions. Indeed, I found a pleasure, an exquisite pleasure, in reflecting upon those past scenes; lest, however, my health might be endangered by this weakness, (I presume it was) and my sister might lose her only protector, I strove to keep it within proper bounds. Wilson and myself had both written to Boston upon our first arrival in Tennessee. My sister received both letters, and S one answer only was returned. She stated that she was well, and expressed much congratulatory pleasure at our safe arrival and kind reception. To Wilson she did not write; at the bottom of the letter to me, she expressed herself thus:—“As you are brothers one letter may suffice for both.” Whether Wilson was pleased, or otherwise with this remark, is not in my power to say, as by his words and gestures I could discover neither the one nor the other. I now wrote to her again, thinking it would be the most agreeable thing to her in the world to hear that I was so happily situated, and had an expectation of a speedy independance for us both. Thus I continued to discharge my duty as a clerk, with undeviating and unremitting attention. Wilson lived in Nashville during the time and was very seldom out of my company; we both boarded at the same table, and slept in the same chamber. In this manner one year rolled round, and my prospects wore a brighter appearance than when I engaged in business. Had I continued in this situation I might have escaped a world of wo! When I reflect on the circumstances alluded to, with calm and rational retrospection, I am more than ever convinced that all human affairs are guided by an over-ruling Providence, and that we are simple instruments by which he effects his purposes. But further remarks are superfluous.—In the course of the last year I formed an acquaintance with a Dr T—. He was a young man of enterprise and talents; generous and insinuating; he possessed every endowment of mind and clegance of person; and with those qualities he had the most daring courage. Dr. T— spent much of his time in Nashville, during the time I have mentioned. I was often in his company. No wonder that I was captivated by this extraordinary man. Though he effectually succeeded in attaching me to his person, yet Wilson alone had his confidence; this I have learned since. It appeared that three hundred of those daring sons of the west, had concerted a secret expedition to the Spanish dominions; and Wilson was included in the number, provided he could bring me over; if not, he would keep their secret; but would not join them. Every one of the number entered into a solemn engagment, confirmed by an oath, never to divulge the nature of the enterprize. This engagement they have most inviolably kept, and it is probable will do so, while they live. Every thing was settled before the subject was imparted to me; this was Wilson's business. He well knew he could intrust me with the secret, even though I might disapprove the project. I was thunder-struck at first, but by degrees, and much persuasion, in in an evil hour I joined the party. But after this many difficulties were to be got over. What was to become of my sister? I could write to her that we were going to Missouri on a hunting party, (which in fact was true,) and that we would return in about six months. “Well, but what shall we say to Mr. and Mrs. Wilson?” “Tell them the same story.” All this was well. We were to rendezvous at St. Louis, the first day of October. Each man was to supply himself with a horse, and as much provision as the horse could carry. Every six were to furnish a horse laden with powder and lead, and other indispensable necessaries. Every man must be furnished with a rifle, a brace of pistols, a dirk, two suits of clothes, and two blankets. These with three small tents were to be put on other horses. These were the general regulations—any man, however, might take as many horses as he pleased; which many of us did. Other regulations were drawn up, for the conduct of the party, which it is unnecessary to detail here. On the day appointed, we met at St. Louis, in high spirits, breathing the most impatient ardour to proceed. Had some kind spirit whispered, “You are about to enter upon an enterprise, for the presumption of which you will be chastised with grievous calamities”—had it whispered that, instead of six months, my absence would embrace three long years of unparalleled sufferings—but oh! no such kind monitor—not the slightest conviction— not the most distant apprehension obtruded on my too unsuspicious mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. After resting ourselves for two days, at St. Louis, we set out, keeping a south-west course until we reached the head of St. Francis river, which we did in fifteen days, without meeting with any accident or impediment. Here we made another halt to rest ourselves and horses, and refit our accoutrements. While we remained here we were visited by the Osage Indians. At first they testified some dislike towards us: seemed wary and suspicious; but upon Capt. T—'s assuring them that he was just going to the western Ocean to catch furs, they approached us with perfect unconcern, and offered to guide us to the head waters of White River. We had remained here three days, and parched a sufficiency of corn to last us twenty days, as our biscuit and flour had given out; Indeed, we had had so much rain for the four or five last days, that our flour was spoiled. We had prepared our provisions, washed our clothes, and intended to set out on the morning of the fourth day—when lo! fortune, which had hitherto favoured us, began to lower. We had concluded to leave about ten of our horses at this place to seek their fortunes the best way they could, as they were unable to proceed further; the remainder were very much reduced, yet we meant to take them some distance further, as we would soon be where wild horses were numerous, from which we could furnish ourselves; but that very night we lost four of our best horses. This was distressing above all; yet we could have borne this much easier than another misfortune, which seemed to threaten us with more serious consequence; this was both sickness and mutiny. Had I known the tempers and dispositions of these Tennesseans before I set out—(but I might apply the remark to any thing else as the present.) One of our men, whose name was Johnston, was taken ill that night; we had a physician in company, who had supplied himself with all sorts of medicine. The physician pronounced his complaint to be “a malignant billious fever, generated from the low, marshy country we were then in.” The Indians informed us that this description of country was endless in the direction we intended to pursue. This operated like an electrical shock upon the whole party, Capt. T. excepted. The alarm spread instantly; dejection pervaded every man's countenance, and by far the greatest part were for turning back. For my own part, although I was among the number of those who wished to return, I said nothing. Then it was that I saw what was in the power of one man to effect, when possessed of talents, persuasion, perseverance, and address. In the first place all possible assistance was bestowed on the sick man, by which time the murmurs and tumult of the rest had measureably subsided. Capt. T. then addressed them in a short, but very animated speech, the design of which went to remove their fears, and revive their hopes. In this speech, every thing that ingenuity could dictate, enthusiasm inspire, or eloquence display, was eminently and emphatically resorted to. Scarcely had he ended, before all cried out, “Boys let's go on: we are not cowards—shall we who never feared the face of man, now be scared by a few swamps and rivers? let's go on, we'll stick by our captain while there's a button on our coats —live or die.” All rose to their feet, as a token of consent, except two brothers, by the name of Jones. Some of those who were acquainted with them, observing this, exclaimed “d—n it, boys, don't he obstinate!” They were incorrigible—Capt. T. appeared somewhat grieved, and remonstrated with them in a style calculated to soothe their tempers. It had no effect—one of them desired Capt. T. to mind his own business: they were free men and their own masters, and would act as they pleased. Both turned pale, and their eyes flashed fire as they spoke. They, however, were not unmatched: hardly did they utter the last word, when one Gibson resented the disrespectful language addressed to Capt. T. He replied to Jones with much warmth, and with displeasure in his countenance, “that he might go to h—ll if he 3* chose, but if he uttered another word of disrespect to Capt. T. he would send him there instantly.” “Capt. T. and you are d—d —!” No sooner was this pronounced than they flew at each other with the rapidity of lightning.—“No man touch:” was reiterated by an hundred voices. “Part them,” said others.— “Stand off,” said the brother of Jones, “or I'll kill the first man that interferes!”—These exclamations, the undressing and engagement of the combatants, and the formation of a ring around them, by the party, were the business of a moment!—In the meantime, though they advanced towards each other with the fierceness of tigers, yet they encountered with cool and deliberate aim, and not a blow was misplaced, no advantage sought, no finess resorted to either by one or the other; while the the most determined courage and presence of mind was displayed on both sides.—They were equal in weight, courage, and skill; in short, they were the most equally matched of any two men in the company; they only differed in age and wind. For about twenty minutes no advantage seemed to be gained by either, it was a regular pass, one after another.—But what equally surprised me, was the perfect unconcern of the party; with the most listless indifference one would take a chew of tobacco, another a pinch of snuff. “That was a durn'd good blow!” says a third, some would cry “well done Gibson!” others “well done Jones!” Wilson and myself who were trembling from head to feet, said nothing, at least above breath. Wilson once observed to me “I'll be hanged if they mind it any more than we do a chicken fight in Virginia!” At the end of half an hour their well-tried strength began to yield a little; both appeared fatigued—some cried “part them:” “no man touch!” said Jones, brother to him who was engaged, “if he does he must be a better man than me!” “A better man than you!” quoth Wilson, “he must be a lion then.”— This might well be applied to a man of his gigantic appearance; being a much stouter man than the one engaged in the fight.—“Fight till you die brother: never give up!” said Jones. “Fight till yo die!” said another to Gibson, “never give up.” Jones was somewhat older than Gibson, but had the best wind, which made them about equal. At length Gibson staggered, and the next blow brought him to the ground—“part them!” said an hundred voices. “No man touch! hands off: hands off!” was reitered by as many more, in a noise that rent the air.—The advantage gained by Jones was momentary; he attempted to keep Gibson down, but in vain: Gibson turned under him and was on his feet in a twinkling, and the fight was renewed with redoubled vigour. How long they would have continued the contest, is unknown; for Capt. T. cried out, “They have fought long enough, part them!” several advanced together, out of the ring, for this purpose, when the other Jones flew among them, with his gun laying about him with the butt end of it, flying about in all directions; some caught hold of the gun, some seized Jones, and others laid hold of the combatants—amongst whom was Wilson. As for me, I kept aloof, wishing myself safe in Boston. Jones, after being disarmed, drew his dirk, broke from those who held him, and flew amongst the crowd like a roaring lion. At the same instant, Capt. T. sprung behind him, caught him by the shoulders, and brought him to the ground, flat on his back. He was now overpowered by numbers, while he grated his teeth, in token of revenge. Had it not been for this well-timed gallantry in Capt. T., bloodshed would have been inevitable. The two heroes were now carried by their respective friends, to a stream of water, to refresh themselves, and to have the blood washed from their faces. Jones, in the mean time, was put under guard, by order of the Captain. The guard, however, were compelled to hold him down forcibly, until he became pacified; which he did in the course of thirty minutes. “And these are your Tennesseans,” said I to Wilson; “but they must have studied fighting as an art, if not as a science. But Capt. T. is a noble fellow. So long as he lives, we have have nothing to fear; but should any accident deprive us of him, bad will be our case.— Nothing but anarchy and bloodshed must ensue.” Perhaps I never was more mistaken in my calculations! as was abundantly proved by subsequent events. I found those very men, those Tennesseans, generous, modest, mild, humane, sincere, and brave—yet peaceable. What was my astonishment upon looking up, when I beheld Jones and Gibson walking arm in arm! They approached the other champion, (Jones) and gently reproved him for his conduct. He smiled and replied— “Tere's nothing like taking a brush now and then; it keeps one's blood in circulation,” and, addressing the Captain, “why the mischief did'nt you let me alone—I would only have killed three or four; and d—n the odds, they'll die, any-how.—Well, boys,” said he addressing the company, “let's go and hunt the horses, the Indians have them, no doubt. Just give me ten men, Captain, and I'll have the horses before I sleep!” “Agreed,” says the Captain, “choose your men.” He picked out ten, brave as himself, but not so stout; and after taking some refreshment, they set out, with the utmost alacrity—filling their canteens with whiskey, of which we had yet a plenty. Thus ended an affair which seemed to threaten the most alarming consequences! The sick man, I should think, would have been worse, from affright, if nothing else. Though I believe it was the means of reviving him, for he seemed much better. I asked him if he was not alarmed at the events of the morning. He said no: and treated it with the utmost indifference. He was very cheerful, and seemed to promise recovery. Upon enquiry, we found that Jones and Gibson were much hurt. And no wonder: the twentieth part of what either received, would have effectually cured me of castle-building, in the air, for ever! And so far from rancour, jealousy, distrust, or coldness, appearing amongst us this evening, the whole was mirth and conviviality. Betting, stories, and singing songs, as if nothing had happened. They put me in mind of the Irish, in this respect—fight one minute and the next they will be better friends than ever. But it was amusing enough, to hear the dialogue which took place between the two champions. After being bled, they laid themselves down to repose, at a friendly distance, and commenced the following dialogue: Gibson. You gave me a d—l of a surloinder right there, (placing his hand upon his side.) Jones. Ah! (said Jones, with a rueful countenance) and you have given me change for it! Gibson. Well, after all, I had no idea you were so tough—why, a body might as well strike the side of a rock! Jones. Why did'nt you cry enough then. Gibson. Aye, truly! and why did'nt you cry enough! Jones. Well, after all, it's nothing but a dog's calling, and I'll quit it: say the same and it's a bargain. Gibson. Agreed. Jones. Never to fight again? Gibson. Never! Upon this they shook hands. And for aught I know, have kept their engagements. Had I not had sufficient proof of the sort of men who were absent, in search of the horses, I might have entertained some doubts of the expedition. Doubtless they would meet with the Indians; but they will soon learn whom they have to deal with. With this reflection, and much less anxiety about the things of this too deluslve world, than I had hitherto felt, I laid myself down by the side of Wilson. These people effectually cured me of many errors—I had thought this world a mighty matter. I had heard and read of greatness of soul, wisdom, liberality, magnanimity, bravery, friendship, and the most profound philosophy, but never saw it before. We were embarked in a bad cause, to say the least of it. It was enterprize improperly directed—it was the error of youth! But what could not such men as these achieve—as they have abundantly proved since. These are the men who distinguished themselves at New-Orleans. These are the men who gained the most brilliant victory recorded in history. These are the brave Tennesseans whose fame has reached distant countries; and will be transmitted down to latest posterity! About ten o'clock at night here came Jones, whooping and hallooing, with the horses. It appeared that our conjectures were correct, respecting the Indians, from the account given by Jones, of whom it must be observed, as a specimen of the people of this country, that he was not only a stranger to fear, but seemed to court danger. Taking the track of the horses, they pursued it through many windings, to an Indian village. Jones rode up amidst about an hundred Indians and demanded the horses instantly—or he would massacre the whole of them. This was soon made known, through their interpreter. “Instantly, instantly!” said Jones. The Indians denied stealing the horses, but said “they would show us where they were.” “That was a good one:” said Jones. “No matter, no matter, move on, move on, show where they are. If they had not stopped the bells we could have heard them. Not a mile from the village, and here we are boys, safe and sound. Give us some supper, Tawney, (speaking to the man who waited.) Pony up, pony up, boys, let's talk and have something to eat. “How are you, Bob?” speaking to his brother. “Ah!” said Bob, “I feel a little sickish about my stomach.” “And how are you, Gibson?” “I feel very stiff and sore,” said Gibson. “I should wonder if you did not,” said Wilson; though he took care not to speak very loud. “No danger of the lock-jaw, ha; is there any hopes of your death? I was afraid when Bob—got you—down,” said Jones, deliberately eating his supper, “that it was all over with you. Never saw a fellow turn so quick, in my life. Well, after all, I'll swear it was the prettiest fight I ever saw.—Well, curse them Indians, I can't get them out of my head. Hadn't they the impudence of the devil—that's true enough. They had like to a made me mad.” After eating his supper, with the utmost composure, Jones went to rest, after making the kindest enquiry after the sick man's health. The next morning we set forward on our journey. The face of the country through which we were travelling, was low, flat, and in many places, very wet and marshy. Our course lay over rivulets, which proved extremely troublesome to cross. Prairies were almost constant. Buffalo and Elks, were often seen; deer were numerous; also wild sheep and an animal of the hare kind. This last was very large and very fleet. Our dogs could by no means keep up with them; these were numerous. We also saw several wild horses that were small and indifferent in their appearance. From the information of the Indians that the further we advanced the better would be our chance to procure good horses, we declined, for the present, any attempt to catch them. They seemed to be very tame and appeared to apprehend no danger from their intruders. They walked slowly off from us without seeming to notice us in the least. The other wild animals preserved nearly the same indifference towards us, except the sheep and the hare— each of which would disappear with the greatest swiftness. Here, too, we passed the prairy hen, which we had before seen on both sides of the Mississippi. These are, in appearance and size, between a pheasant (as it is called in this country,) and the domestic hen. It is more like the latter. They cluck like the hen and are followed by numerous flocks of chickens. My companions said they were often seen in the farm-yards, among the settlers, west of the Mississippi, perfectly tame, and supplied the tables of the settlers. We killed numbers, and found them delicious. We also found the prairy dog, as it was called, being a species of the dog kind. It is, however, more like the fox, but much larger than any I had ever seen. They were of a very dark, nearly a black colour. These animals, as well as the hen, are peculiar to the prairies. They are great enemies to the hen, upon which they mostly subsist. Both are numerous. Our dogs would often pursue the prairy dog—but without success. The latter would instantly disappear in the numerous holes which they burrow for themselves in the ground. These prairies are covered with wild rye, higher than the tallest man's head, and so thick that you could not see a man, on horse-back, at five paces distant. The streams (I mean the margins) were as thickly covered with cane. We pursued our journey, mostly on foot, keeping a little west of south.—Headed the White river, and struck the Arkrnsaw river in latitude 36° in four days. During our journey we found vast masses of pure salt, which proved very acceptable. The trees had not cast their leaves. And the animals, quite similar to those I mentioned, with this difference only—the horses seemed to be stout, and more shy. The land very fertile, and covered with wild rye. Johnson had not yet recovered. In fact he grew worse, but continued, however, to travel; though at a slow rate. As we seemed to gain higher and less marshy ground, we entertained some hopes of his recovery; but his disease had taken too fast hold of him; and the doctor gave him up. On account of this unfortunate circumstance we unanimously agreed to await the issue on the banks of the Arkansas. But we waited not long. In twelve hours from the time we halted, Johnston breathed his last! His easy death, and the calm composure with which he met it, might rank him among the most profound philosophers, if not among the most pious christians. On the north bank of the Arkansas, a lofty elm looks down upon the humble tomb of Johnston. Peace to his shade! He was one of the meekest and most pleasant young men I ever met with. After each had paid the tribute of a tear to his memory, we set forth once more. We crossed the Arkansas, on a raft, took six, only, of our best horses. Leaving the rest on the other side of the river. Our baggage was considerably reduced. Part of it we lost: some was worn out; and we had but three bushels of Indian corn remaining! We were, however, no way disheartened on account of bread, having cured a quantity of venison, with the salt mentioned, and dried it in the sun. We found it a good substitute for bread. Meat, we brought none— calculating to subsist on game, it being found in great plenty. Our amunition, upon which our subsistence depended, was the only thing which gave us any concern. As long it lasted, such as we were, we had no obstacles to fear. Our whole attention, therefore, was turned towards that, which we husbanded with great care. When we crosed the river, we caught seven wild horses, upon which we disposed our baggage, and pursued our journey. Keeping due south, we arrived at Wahashitta river, in five days. Latitude 84½°. Still pursuing a southerly direction, we entered, (as we supposed) Lower Louisiana in two days. Here we were compelled to halt, in order to refit, recruit ourselves, and take medicine. The death of Johnston had struck a damp on our spirits, which had already began to flag, on account of the distance we had travelled, and still more that which was to come. But now our misfortune wore a more serious aspect. Several of us being attacked with a fever! At this place we were gratified with pomegranates, oranges, and figs, growing wild; but saw no habitation. Whether this fruit was the spontaneous production of the soil, or whether, as appeared most likely, the seed was accidentally dropped, by some adventurous traveller, I have never been able to learn. Grapes of various kinds abounded, besides a variety of other fruit. The forest was perfectly green, and no appearance that either frost or snow had visited this mild region. Although the beautiful appearance of the country, and a fine spring of water was a sufficient indecement to protract our departure; yet we were apprehensive, from the marshy ground, which surrounded us, and which determined us to hasten our departure. But we were unfortunately detained six days. On the evening of the second, about an hour before sun-down, being all collected together, some sitting, some laying down, some elated by the near approach of incalculable wealth, and others cursing themselves for fools, wished all the mines to the d—I! when a tremendous roaring assailed our ears. Various were the conjectures respecting it—some said it was wind—others a water-fall, or a water-course of some sort. It 4 seemed to approach nearer, and became louder as it drew near. I could not see a tree move, although the roaring was, to our senses, ready to overwhelm us. I gave myself up for lost, when our guide cried out with a loud voice, “Take trees—take trees,” and setting the example. As there happened to be trees near, every man flew to a tree, with his gun in hand, expecting nothing less than an engagement with some foe. Scarcely had each man gained his tree, when a great number of cattle approached us, running by at full speed! They rushed by us, without taking the least notice of us, whatever; several of our men fired upon them, but it made not the least difference in their career. Had we not taken shelter behind the trees the instant we did, we should inevitably have been maimed, if not crushed to death. There could not have been less than five hundred! When the noise had died away, and our guide, to whom this phenomenon was familiar, was explaining it to us, we discovered an army of men, on horseback, advancing towards us at a round gallop They were without saddles or bridles, and almost without clothes, having on a remnant only, of what had once been such. They wore no hats. But instead of them, a piece of cloth was tied on their heads. They were exceedingly sun-burnt, if they ever had been fair. There were about thirty of them, in number. This fantastic group, in the manner they approached, resembled men broke loose from bedlam, more than persons in their senses. As they drew near, we perceived that each of them was armed with a club, from four to five feet in length; and our party, to a man, made ready to fire in case of an attack. But they approached us in perfect peace. When they discovered us they stopped suddenly, and appeared no less surprised at us than we were at them. They gazed at us in silent astonishment. We spoke first, through our guide, who understood their bad French. They proved to be Louisianians, whose business it was to attend those vast herds of cattle, which abound in the natural meadows, which over-spread the country in this region. We found them grossly ignorant, particularly on the geography of their country. They could give no account of their towns, number of inhabitants, the productions, nor even how far they themselves were bound. All that we could get out of them, was that “they belonged to the parish of — and were employed by Monsieur —, to attend his cattle, that we had not seen more than one half, and that they were driving those home, which passed by us. We enquired how far they came, and how far they had to go? but might as well have addressed the man in the moon. “They had travelled,” they said, “two days, since they gathered the cattle.” But of the distance they had yet before them, they were perfectly ignorant. We asked them how far they lived from New-Orleans, but these swarthy sons of Adam, stared at us with awkward stupidity. Captain T. invited them to stay and spend the night with us, to which some of them appeared to assent. But the major part seemed to refuse, alleging they must stay by the cattle. One of them, who seemed to be of some consequence among his fellows, asked “where we were going?” Jones replied, “to England, to catch herrings!” but his quiz was lost on these ignorant creatures. They very generously offered us a part of their scanty allowance of yams, for which we gave them an equivalent in money, and they departed. The horses they rode were greatly superior to those we had seen. And the judgment and skill with which they managed them was surprising. At a signal, from the rider, the horses would proceed or stand still. And the slightest touch of the hand, on the side of the neck, turned the animal's course at the pleasure of the rider. When they left us I felt as though I would have been glad to accompany them. I began seriously to repent of my rashness in joining the party, and had it been at my option again, it certainly would be the last thing I would do. But the die was cast, and it was in vain to think of retreat. I certainly did feel melancholy on the departure of these Frenchmen. On the morning of the seventh day we set forward again, and the second day, at night, we arrived on the banks of the Red river, as we have since understood, for at that time we knew not its name. We crossed it in the morning, and after travelling two days more we discovered we were bearing too near the gulph. And turning more to the westward we headed Sabine river in three days. We had received information from the Indians whom we met almost every day, that it was much the best way, the land being less marshy. We continued to keep the same course, without halting, except at night, for seven days, when our journey seemed, in all likelihood, at an end, not by gaining the object of our journey, but by the obstruction of a great river! Here we sat down, disposed to rest and reflection. Our situation at this time was such as would have discouraged any but Tennesseans. Worn out with fatigue, some thousand miles from home, with no other food than what the forest yielded, most of us very young men, a river which we neither knew the name nor width of, being unable to see the land on the opposite shore, was such as to call up every power of the human mind!— Now, thought I, our Quixotte party must return, for it is impossible they will have the hardihood to attempt crossing such a river. No such thing—they were not made to be intimidated by rivers. And to my astonishment, set about making a raft, which, with infinite labour, was completed in four days, and we effected our landing on the other side in two, all safe! We were now fairly over the Rubicon. Here we found the Indians very numerous, much more so than on the other side, and more intelligent. They gave us plenty of fruit to eat, and informed us, as near as we could understand them, that we were within ten days journey of Mexico! This they did by signs, pointing first to the sun and then to their fingers, until they told ten. The country was still more beautiful than that on the other side of the river. We found the cocoa in plenty; a few pine-apples and figs, and grapes without number. But these were poor substitutes for bread. We ate of them, however, and travelled on, procuring a few yams, now and then, from the natives. On the fifth day after crossing the great river, we began to ascend, as it were. The low, marshy ground giving place to a more elevated soil. The productions of which were as beautiful as the most extravagant fancy could conceive. And in three days more we reached St. Juan, a considerable village, inhabited by Spaniards, Indians, and Creoles. Here we rested three days, and with great difficulty procured some Indian corn from the inhabitants. Our guide, or interpreter, rather, for he knew nothing of the way for the last ten days, with great difficulty made out to explain to us the conversation of these people. And their conduct towards us was rather unfriendly. Jealousy, I could see, was depicted in their countenances. They interrogated us with a minuteness which plainly evinced suspicion. Our guide informed them, by whose instructions heaven only knows, that we were going to Mexico to form a treaty of amity and commerce, with their government!! They seemed, as well they might, not to credit this representation. If we had acted cowardly, I have no doubt they would, at least, have attempted to make us prisoners. But such as we were, and such as we appeared, perfectly at our ease, regardless of their significant looks, they offered us no violence. During our stay at St. Juan, we received no hospitality from the Spaniards, whatever. What necessaries we obtained we received from the Indians and Creoles. In the mean time we endeavoured to obtain some knowledge of the country, particularly that which lay between us and Mexico, such as its towns, population, and mines. Our enquiries were principally addressed to the Indians, but they maintained the strictest silence on all these subjects, at least so far as ever came to my knowledge. Whatever the rest of the party felt on this occasion, I for one, became completely discouraged. I saw plainly, that we had laboured in vain; and that our tedious and perilous journey had turned out to be, a perfectly Quixotic expedition. We were, at least, two thousand miles from home; and what were our prospects? 4* Wilson's chivalrous spirit had effectually subsided; but he would be guided by Captain T. who kept up the spirits of the party, and, apparently, his own. Some of our men took an excursion through the surrounding country; but, making no discovery to their liking, we, Don Quixote like, set forward towards Mexico. After leaving St. Juan, we kept a south-west course, and made diligent search for a rich silver mine, which we understood to lie in that direction. I now discovered, for the first time, that the silver mine was the object. I had, indeed, been told enough to know, that silver or gold was, in fact, the object of this infatuated journey; though nothing had expressly transpired from those who were in the secret. But on the morning of the second day after leaving St. Juan, the whole of the plan, displayed at length on paper, was submitted for the inspection of every individual in the company. The richness of the mine, its situation, &amp;c. were clearly pointed out. It was represented to be two hundred and eighty miles north-west from Mexico. We concluded that we were within four hundred miles of that city, and resolved to search every inch of the intervening ground, lest we might overlook an object that had already cost us its full value, let that be what it might. I felt somewhat relieved upon learning that the object of this perilous undertaking was a little less than storming the city of Mexico. We now spread out, in all directions, over the plain; anxiously examining every little aperture, and every eminence; pulling up the weeds and looking at the earth that adhered to the roots. Sad and silent, I walked on, not caring whither, though often forced to smile at the eagerness and industry of my companions; particularly one of them, who ran to me, in great haste, to know what a silver mine was like. I told him I did not know, myself, as I had never seen one. In short, we continued to wander about, making but little progress in a straight line, owing to our often separating. We saw several Indians; but paid little attention to them, except to procure a little bread; which we found very difficult. On the seventh day after leaving St. Juan, Wilson and myself had separated from the company, as we had often done before. But, on this day, we were mutually resolved to withdraw, secretly, from the party, and make our way home, by New-Orleans. We had some idea of the course and distance of Vera Cruz; and, should we be so fortunate as to find it, we would attempt a passage to New-Orleans. We had money enough, between us, for every purpose; and, should we fail in making the port of Vera Cruz, we determined at once to go to Mexico, and throw ourselves on the mercy of the Spaniards. Finally, we determined to hazard every thing, rather than stay longer from home. Having formed this resolution, and being almost fainting from weariness, and want of food, we stretched ourselves on the ground to gain a little refreshment from sleep, fully determined to adopt our plan when we arose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. How long we had slept I know not, when we were suddenly aroused by the trampling of horses, and upon looking up, to our astonishment, beheld about three hundred men, armed with swords and pistols, and were made prisoners before we were fairly awake! We remonstrated in bold terms against this outrage, adding that “we were citizens of the United States, and came on friendly terms, that there was a large party of us, and finally, they would be made to pay dear for offering such violence to our persons.” To all this they returned no answer, but proceeded to place us on horses, confining our hands behind our backs with cords, and our feet under the body of the horse, in the same manner. Our rifles, which they seized the first thing, together with our pistols, were carried by the men, in triumph. They now set forward, and hurried us on at an unmerciful rate, and when we complained they menaced us in an angry tone, and made signs as though they would shoot us. They continued to travel, at the same rate, in an easterly direction till dark, it being about twelve o'clock when they came upon us. About dusk we arrived at a considerable village, the name of it, I have since understood, was Depotozy. We were now released from the horses, and conducted into a room tolerably furnished, a guard of fifty men being placed outside of the door, which they locked after them, they left us. In the course of thirty minutes the door was opened, and four armed men came into the room, bearing a large wooden bowl, containing our suppers. This consisted of meat, cut in small pieces, mixed up with soup and Indian corn. One of the men, whom I knew to be one of those who captured us, and who rode by our side to this place, addressed us in broken English and invited us to eat, but although we were near perishing with hunger, at the time, nothing would have been more acceptable than the savoury contents of the bowl. Yet our sad reverse of fortune had such an effect upon us that we felt little appetite to eat. We did, however, drink some of the soup, eat a few mouthfulls of meat, and enquired of the man, in the meantime, the cause of our captivity, and what they designed to do with us? He answered, with a frown, “that we would find that out when we got to the city of Mexico,” and finally gave us no other satisfaction. He soon withdrew and left us to our own reflections. Of all the acts of folly that ever were committed by men in their senses, it certainly was the greatest in us to stop or make ourselves known at St. Juan. And although disappointment and disaster must finally be the end of this ill-judged undertaking, yet this step was the sure way to hasten our ruin, as it appeared in the sequel. A guard, or military station, was kept at St. Juan. These men dispatched a messenger to Mexico, to apprize that city of our intrusion; and a party of soldiers was immediately dispatched, either to destroy or take us prisoners. This we learned afterwards. Next morning we were visited by the principal of the town, as we took him to be from his appearance. And the same person who addressed us the evening before, attended as an interpreter. This person asked us “what were our motives in visiting their country with an armed force?” We replied that we were armed only for the purpose of procuring food, and defending ourselves from the savages, that we were exploring our own country, and were obliged to pass through theirs. He replied that he had but little doubt but that we were spies, and in pursuit of their mules with a view of purloining them, as we had heretofore done. He enquired how many there were of us, and what had become of the others? With respect to our numbers, I answered him correctly, and without hesitation.—Observing that we had separated from our companions, in order to return home by water, being unable to reach there on foot, which was true, and that we could not say what had become of our party. We remonstrated against being detained as prisoners, alleging that his government would be held responsible for his conduct. To this he made no reply, but said something in the Spanish language to those around him, the purport of which I presume was, that they must proceed with us to Mexico, for thither we were immediately conveyed. We arrived at that city on the fourth day, about noon, being escorted by about fifty men, on horseback, armed with clubs, swords, and pistols. When we entered Mexico we were immediately carried into the presence of the Viceroy, who questioned us upon our motives in entering their territories, our number, &amp;c. We answered nearly in the same manner as we had done before. After various efforts to extort from us further confession, this representative of Spainish royalty ordered us into close confinement, in separate apartments. Nor would they allow us the use of pen, ink, or paper, or any means of communicating with each other. At the end of eight days I was brought out before his majesty again, who was this time surrounded by a numerous crowd of attendants. He put the same questions to me as before, and I made the same replies. I was now confronted with a witness, who, it seems, had arrived from St. Juan. By him I was charged with dissembling, my confession being at variance with the declaration of our men, at that place. I replied that I was not accountable for the hair-brain expressions of a few wild young men, and that I told them the truth. When I was ordered to retire I refused, and said I would rather die than be detained in prison. I remonstrated in bold and forcible language against this outrage upon my liberty, and denounced the heaviest vengeance upon the whole Spanish nation. My feelings were wrought up to such a height that I would rather have died than not. I had committed no offence against their country, nothing had been proved against me, and even if there had been, I disclaimed their jurisdiction! But this brutal Spaniard was immovable, and I was seized and forcibly lodged in a dungeon, as dark as midnight, in a different part of the city from that in which I had hitherto been confined. As the sound of the last door reached my ear, it appeared as if I had taken final leave of the world! Had I been sentenced to death I could not have felt worse.— My former prison was a palace, compared to this. It was lighted with windows, and furnished with mats, tables, and seats. I had hitherto been supplied with tolerable food—behold me now, shut up in a dungeon dark as midnight, chained down in such a manner that I could just bend my body and once a day fed with bread water! Had I been blessed with the company of my friend, even in this situation, it would have been supportable. Doomed, for aught I knew, to drag out a long life of suffering perhaps, without ever more seeing the light of the sun!— Death, in any shape, in its worst of terrors, would have been mercy, compared to the tortures I endured. I raved, I bewailed my fate, I called on my keeper to put me to death rather than leave me in such a place. In short, my sufferings were such, that I was seized with a fever, which depived me of my reason. How long I was deranged, I am even yet ignorant; but when I regained my senses, I found myself unchained, a lamp in my cell, and attended by a different keeper. “You must be an angel,” said I, as I attempted to raise myself up to examine his features;) “and I must be in heaven.” Relieved from the impenetrable gloom which pervaded my dungeon, my first sensations were, that I was actually in another world. “Why, sure now, I am glad to hear you say that;” said the man, with an Irish accent; “and you have been stark mad, this long while.” “And who are you?” said I, “and how came I to be unchained?” “My name, thin, is Dennis O'Conner; and your chains were taken off by the order of the governor, because they thought you was dying.” “How long have I been sick, Dennis?” “Indeed, thin, I can't tell. I have been with you six days, and a time I have had of it. Always calling for drink, and calling for Henry; and spakin all the nonsinse, and they was afraid you would die, and they sint me to take care of you, because I could spake the same tongue as yoursilf.” “And what has become of my friend, the young man who was taken with me? Can you give me any information respecting him, my friend?” He shewed an unwillingness to answer this enquiry; saying his life would pay the forfeit, if it were known that he gave me any information on the subject. He informed me that he was an Irishman, and had lived with the Spaniards nineteen years. He expressed much pleasure at my recovery, and said he must go and report the same to his mistress: and, leaving the lamp burning he bid me farewell. In the course of a few hours, Dennis returned.— “Och!” said he, “you don't know how they are lifted up, to hear that you are getting well again:” and, drawing near, addressed me in a whisper, saying, “I have brought your honour a little bit of a chicken here; but, for the love of God, don't be saying any thing about it; and here's a drop of wine to nourish you, and put strength in you. I tould my young lady that it was a great shame that sich a gentleman as your honour should lie here, like a baste, and that you had a stomach to your victuals, and ought to have something better than could water.” “Who is your young lady, my friend? Is she the governor's daughter? or whose daughter is she?” “My young lady, God bless her, for she is the best crature that ever trod on nates leather, is the governor's daughter.” “I thank you, my friend, and your young lady, too.” “Och! if I had time I could tell you a deal about her and her maither. But do now rise up and try to ate a bit, it will help to strengthen you. But as I was saying, my lady's mother is dead, she died when my lady was a bit of a child—and many's the day I've carried her in my arms, and learn'd her to spake English. Och, if you had seen her mother, just to hear her when she was a dying, poor soul! “Dennis,” says she, “never while you live, never forsake my child, I am going to leave her in the wide world, and I shall depend on you, Dennis, to take care of my child while there is breath in your body.” Faith! she might well say that—but divil a bit of her was I going to lave if she hadn't a tould me. Rest her sowl, she is in etarnity now, and I'm sure I wouldn't tell a lie about it!” “What country woman was she, Dennis,” said I, willing to keep up the conversation for the sake of amusement. “Why, sure, she was a Portigeese lady, though she was born in swate Ireland, and whin she was woman grown her mother took her to Portigal, and ill luck betide me, who should they take to wait upon them, but Dennis. But why in the name of the Vargin don't you ate sir, and drink a bit of the wine, it will strangthen your stomach.” “I cannot eat, for joy Dennis, to think that you and your young lady have had compassion on such a poor miserable being as I am. I hope that heaven will reward you both. But go on with your story, Dennis, you were going to tell me about your lady, the sound of your voice is music to my ear.” “I can't stay now,” said he, “I'll tell you some other time.” “Can you learn what is to done with me, Dennis?” “Oh, I suppose they'll jist kape you in here awhile, and maybe have you before the Inquisition.—I don't hear any thing about what they are agoing to do. But one thing I do know—that my lady's in a peck of troubles about you and the other man.” “Ah, true! what has become of him: for God's sake tell me where he is!” Before he had time to reply I heard a deep groan, resembling a human voice—“What can that be, Dennis?” He seemed no way surprised, but rather appeared to shrink from the question, though he spoke not. “That must be some unfortunate being, Dennis. Oh, my kind friend, tell me, is it Wilson? is it my unfortunate companion?” “Now you are so coaxin' you would almost make a body forsware themselves, and maybe—” said Dennis hesitatingly “but then father Antonio would say it was a hainous crime. But if I thought—” 5 “Fear me not, friend, I will never betray you, I would suffer a hundred deaths first, I would sooner suffer the tortures of your infernal Inqusition itself.” “Holy Father,” ejaculated Dennis, “if my lady's father had heard you say that—” “I will not then speak against the customs of your country. For your sake I will not do it, but more particularly for the sake of your young lady.” “You know her then?” “No indeed I do not, I never saw her, of whom you speak. But, dear Dennis, keep me no longer in suspense, does my friend live, and was it him that we heard just now?” “Why sure, then,” said Dennis, pointing to the place with his finger, and nodding an assent with his head at the same time. This was enough. “He lives then?” said I, “could I contrive some means of conversing with him I should be happy, though in a dungeon!” I was silent some time, and finding that Dennis made no reply, I asked some questions respecting the nature of the wall that separated the dungeons. “It cannot be very thick Dennis, and since you have given me such, and so many testimonials of your friendship, could you not aid me in procuring some instrument to make a small opening in the partition,—by which means we might converse?” Dennis, after some hesitation, exclaimed suddenly— “I am overstaying my time, I shall talk a bit with my lady about it.” And intimated that it was a dangerous thing to attempt. “You don't know these Spaniards yet!” Saying this he left me. After his departure I crawled, being unable to walk, to the place from whence the groan issued, and called to Wilson as loud as I was able, but received no answer.— I repeated my efforts, but in vain. I struck the wall with my hand, and with the lamp, which Dennis had left with me, I examined every inch of the partition, but found no aperture or any place more favourable than another for my purpose. The partition was constructed of huge pieces of timber, laid length-ways and clampt with iron, through which iron screws were inserted. I continued my efforts to make myself heard, until I was completely exhausted, and threw myself down in hopeless agony. While I lay in a fainting condition I thought of the wine left by the kind-hearted Dennis, and swallowing a large draught, it immediately restored me. I then ate the chicken entirely up, and was scarcely done when the well known voice of Wilson assailed my ear. I crept to the place from whence the sound proceeded, and eagerly enquired after his health. He replied that he was well and had been much distressed on account of my indisposition, his keeper having informed him that I could never recover! I satisfied him, so far as I knew, respecting it. After mutual congratulations respecting our ability to converse, he gave me the following account: “When I was separated from you I was ordered before the Viceroy, where, having gone through a strict examination, I was sent to this wretched dungeon.—I gave my enemies to understand that they would pay dear for their conduct, and demanded pen, ink, and paper, to write to my government on the subject of my confinement. This was refused. I then demanded leave to write to my parents. This was also refused. I repeated my request with redoubled boldness, regardless of the consequence. At length my request was granted, and I wrote to my father, but I have little hopes of its ever reaching him. I saw treachery in their looks too plain to believe they will suffer any communication between us and our country. “Dissimulation was too visible in their countenances. I however submitted the letter to their inspection, as I wished to convince them I was not the poor wretch they took me to be, having called on my father, in it, to send me two thousand dollars. “I was then lodged in this infernal den, and fed once a day on bread and water. As I can speak their language a little, I was soon apprised of your illness. By soothing the barbarian who attended me, I at length prevailed on him to tell me your fate, which I had suspected. It was he who informed me that you were sick and in the adjacent dungeon. “After imploring this wretch as earnestly as though I were begging for my life, which in fact was the same thing, he gained permission from the Intendant to allow me a light. “In his various visits to my cell, I could see by the light of the lamp that the wall which separated us was of wood, which suggested the idea that I might succeed in opening a place, through which we might converse. “That was about ten days since, during which I have been engaged in making the opening with my tommahawk, which the Spaniards overlooked when they disarmed me, and which I have taken care to keep concealed. With this and my hunting-knife I worked day and night, desisting only when I looked for the man to bring me food.” Upon my expressing some wonder that he had continued to keep the place concealed, he replied that he had contrived, with the assistance of his knife, to cut the first piece out so adroitly that it fitted the aperture exactly, and concealed the fragments in a hole which he had dug in the floor. We now discussed the subject of our imprisonment and release, with the probabilities in favour and against us. We continued to converse and console each other the whole of that night, and endeavoured to draw comfort though remote from the idea, that if the letter forwarded by Wilson should miscarry, yet some of our party might escape and apprise our friends of our captivity. This was the only certainty we had of relief, but this spoke a long captivity! Wilson, who had been chained when he was first put in the dungeon, said he was relieved from it in about two or three days. Briefly, we talked ourselves asleep, from which I was roused by Dennis about nine o'clock the next morning. Almost the first question I asked Dennis was— “whether he had received any reprehension for staying so long with me the preceding day?” He replied that he had not, and that no one knew of it but his young lady. “I went straight to her,” he said, “and tould her about your friend, the young man. She is sorry enough for him.” “Dennis, says she, I wish you might contrive some means to see him, for I cannot send him any thing by his kaiper.” “I'll warrant he would be glad to oblige you. What business is it to any one what he does for you?” “I will try him,” says she, “he cannot but refuse.— Dennis, say you he has nothing but bread and water?” “No, sure he has not,” says I, “I can assure you, Donna, it is too bad for a Christian!” “I will see,” said she, “what can be done.” “She tould me to go and tell the kaiper she wanted to see him. So behold ye, whin he wint in to see my lady, what does I do but kape myself clare out of sight, mind ye, to hear what was goin' on, for I never had a very warm heart for this Spanish gentry—so my lady ups and tells how bad you and your friend was sarved, and that they would all be made to suffer for it in the long run, and comes round the lad the handsomest way you ever saw. And so after blathering a bit of a while with him she axes him to drink a glass of wine, and says to him, says she—but why don't your honour ate, here's some good hot coffee and hot cakes, they will all get could.” The sweat by this time was standing in great drops on my forehead, from mere anxiety to know the amount of Dennis' communication. Though I was much pleased at hearing him talk at all times, I would rather have heard the subject in one word at the present. But that would be impossible from one of his method, and sitting to my breakfast Dennis continued— “So, as I was after telling you, Jaques drinks the wine. Says Donna to him— “How does your prisoner come on, and what do you give him to eat?” “Why he comes on very well. I take him plenty of bread and water once every day.” “Poor nourishment, Jaques! Do you think it would be any harm, if you was in his place, to give you something more nourishing now and then!” 5* “No, I don't think it would, if it was not found out by the Viceroy.” “And how can it be found out? I will give you a little wine and coffee, and here, take the key and tell Dennis to bring a pound or two of cheese out of the old side-board, and come to me directly, before my father returns home.” “Maybe I wasn't into the side-board quick, for once.” “And, do you hear, if any one asks you where you are going with it, say Donna is sending it to a poor neighbour—quick, now, off!” “So she packed him off before he had time to say his sowl was his own!” “I am glad to hear it, Dennis: and was it your lady that sent me my breakfast?” “Faith! and who else would send it but her? Do you think I would tell her you was so troubled that you could not ate? And bless your swate sowl, here's a bottle of wine in my pocket! and here in my 'tother pocket is a bottle of oil for your flickering lamp. And my lady says you must have books to read, and she has enough of them too! She says they belonged to her mother. “But I'll tell you what—we must carry on the flam. My lady says to me, says she—`we must kape it sacret, about the young man's getting well, or they'll take you away.' And that would be a pity says I, to let him come under them black-hearted guards that never had a drap o' warm blood in their bodies, and so Donna we will kape them in ignorance!” “And your lady has sent something comfortable to my friend?” “Long life to her, and that's what she has!” “She must be an angel, that lady of yours, I wish I could see her!” “What if I should tell you now, that you have seen her! Would'nt you think that strange?” “If I ever have, I did not observe her. I have been so strictly guarded since I entered the city, that I have had no opportunity of seeing any thing.” “But what if I was to tell you that she has been in here when you was sick, and brought her maids with her, and brought you medicine, and brought you teas, and chocolate, and wine, and wet your face with hartshorn, and gave me twenty charges about you. Och! its all because she has Irish blood in her veins!” This brought to my mind an apparition, which appeared to me, during my illness. I thought a divine looking female stood over me, and seemed to regard me with uncommon concern; but of her I had but a faint recollection. “Your lady is beautiful, then,” said I, “for I think now I recollect her.” “Indeed is she, then, as an angel. Oh, if you was to see her rosy cheeks, and her eyes as black as a sloe.” Finding I had touched the right string of Dennis' heart, and desirous of availing myself of the amusement his conversation afforded me, I reminded him of his promise to finish the narrative of his mistress and her mother's lives. “But, in the first place, Dennis, tell me how it happened that you were sent to attend me, at all.” Taking up some cheese, as I spoke, “Aye, that's as good Cheshire as ever crossed the salt seas; and do taste a drop of wine. My lady said you must drink hearty. Well, I was going to tell you all about my lady and her mother, and how we come to lave Ireland; but you want to know what made 'em sind me to wait on you. Why, sure, I tould you that before. They began to think you would die on their hands, and got scared, and thought the people in the States would find it out and make a rout about it; and the man didn't understand you, and they sint me to you because I could spake Inglish and tell what you said; and I just happened to come in the nick of time. If it hadn't been for me, and Donna Leanora, it would have been all over with you, before now.” “There was a large party of us, Dennis, when I was made prisoner. Did you ever hear what became of them?” “Why, no, I can't say as I did hear what become of them; but I heard my lady say how they had a sharp engagement with them; but I'll ax her more about it. Do now take another sip of the wine; my lady will be sure to ax me, the first thing, if the gintleman drank any of it.” “Well, Dennis, I will, for her sake; and the next time you come, bring me the books you spoke of.” “Well, I was goin to tell you about thim same books, too; and how my lady's mother, rest her soul, come to buy them.” Wishing to turn the channel of his discourse, I renewed my request to hear the particulars of his lady's family;—when Dennis seemed to be balancing in his mind, whether he should begin the story that day, or postpone it to another; and finally said he would put it off to another time, as it would detain him too long from his mistress, who would, by this time, be looking for his return. As he turned to go out, I reminded him of the books, and also, if it was in his power, to bring me pen, ink, and paper. He bowed, and withdrew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. After the departure of Dennis, I approached the place of communication between myself and Wilson, (who of course had heard most of the conversation between me and Dennis.) When he informed me of his good cheer, mutual congratulations took place, upon the change in our situation; and we drew favourable omens from the interest which this fair unknown took in our misfortunes. Although our situation was greatly improved, yet still it was such as to render it impossible for any human being to exist in it long. My dungeon was about eight feet by six, damp, and several feet under ground. Not a ray of light, and very little air. Wilson's, he told me, was nearly the same. Both were without flooring, and the water we drank was of a very bad quality; but, as we had brought the misfortune on ourselves, we concluded to meet it with fortitude and patience. Wilson had, generally, been free from sickness, but he now complained of a head-ache, occasioned as he supposed, by drinking too much of the wine, and indulging in the good things which had been sent him by Leanora. It was about eleven oclock, as we conjectured, when, concluding some accident had deprived us, for that night, of Dennis, we began to prepare for sleep. Soon, however, the doors began to open, and Dennis entered my Dungeon with a dark lantern in his hand. “May the powers bless us! but I've had a tramp of it, comin in the dark,” said Dennis; “here's all the things your honour tould me to bring. My lady sends a thousand good wishes to you, and hopes you'll have your liberty soon.” “I thank her, from my soul, Dennis. Her kindness greatly overbalances the cruelty of the monsters who detain me in this dungeon. But let us see what you have brought.” Upon looking over the books, I found Sterne, Goldsmith, Pope, Ariosto's Orlando, Don Quixote, and a few novels. “My lady says she will sind you more, and she will sind your friend some too. But for the love of God don't be saying anny thing about it, or it might cause a dale of harm.” “There is not much danger of that, Dennis. Your Spanish gentry will not trouble me much with their company, and I should be sorry if they did.” “I'll tell you what—my mistress is coming to see you to-morrow night, herself; to see how you are—and says I must make you a fresh bed, and take away this ould hay; and she would send you both some bed-clothes if it was not for fear—Och! if her mother was alive it would not be this way you'd be sarved. “Many's the prisoner she has released from these cursed dungeons. She used to say that none but the divil himself would think of burying paiple alive. And my maister, poor sowl! is not a bad man naither. But if he was to show you any lenity he would be dungeon'd himself, and maybe lose his head into the bargain!” Finding his volubility of tongue had somewhat abated, I essayed to slip in a word, for though it was no easy matter to thwart Dennis in the midst of his oratorical career, yet I could change its course at pleasure. I therefore asked him “if he had enquired of his lady respecting our men?” He answered that he had, and she told him they were seen, and attacked by the Spaniards, fought valiantly, and made their escape. “I am glad of that, Dennis. Here's a guinea for you—your fidelity however, is above all price, and you are more than a friend.” “Here take your money—d'ye think I'd take any thing in way of parquisites? Why, if my lady was to know of my doing such a thing, she'd never let me darken her door!” Dennis handed back the guinea, with something like contempt in his countenance, saying he thanked me; but his mistress never suffered him to be without money. “You say she is coming to-morrow? You must bring me some razors in the morning. Can you shave pretty well, Dennis?” “Yes—and I reckon it will be a task too, your beard is a fright, as my lady used to say to me when she'd be sending me with letters and compliments; the sowl is in them for ladies—there's none of your outlandish females that come up to them. “Folks may say what they plaise, but give me an Irish lady—that's the lady after all, none can compare with them, and that you know; for I'll warrant many's the one you've seen in them there States.” “I shall not understand your mistress, Dennis. I am afraid I shall need your assistance to aid me in expressing myself to her, as I ought.” “My stars alive! Why sure you are not crazy yet, are you? Didn't I tell your honour that my mistress spoke Inglish; and went to Paris, and London, and Madrid, and all the world over, to get her eddication— and larned all the languages? I'm sure I ought to know, when I went with her myself. “Oh, I could tell you a great dale about my rakes and rambles: if I have not seen the scenes of life, I wonder!” said he, sitting himself down on the rude bed by my side. “You have lived in the family, then, some time?” “Man and boy, I have lived in it forty years. My lady took me when I was only ten years old. She lived at Tiperara, in Ireland, and had a liking for my mother, rest her sowl! and when my mother died she took me home and made a pet of me, and sint me to school, and dressed me up, and gave me good larnin, and who should she have to wait on her but Dennis? “Well, as little I could do, but I never wore livery— She said Mary O'Conner's son should never come to that!” “And she took you to Portugal?” “I'll tell how it was,” said Dennis, setting in for a night's siege, at least. “My lady was sickly at times, and the doctors said that nothing but a sea-voyage would help her. And so they carries her to Portigal, and there does her mother marry a great Portigeese lord, or duke, I can't tell what he was: and so she never went back to Ireland, no never more! And so we staid at this Lisbon, it was a great town, to be sure, but the paiple was a gloomy sort of heathens. Lord how feared I used to be of my Lord, when I used to stand behind my lady's chair. I don't know what the divil she could see in him, for he looked, for all the world, like a hangman: but they said there was some family connection—the divil take the connection!” said Dennis, sighing deeply. “It has caused me many a bitter sigh! it is the cause of my being here now—but it's all one, my father and mother are both dead long ago. And so as I was telling you, my lady's mother she married—” “And did your lady marry in this country or in Portugal?” “I'll tell you how it was. My present master's father, who they say was a far-out relation of the lord that married my lady's mother; (but it makes no odds) he was travelling with his family; he was a Spaniard and lived in Spain, and he came to the same house where we was, and happened to pop in there just at the celebration of the nuptials, and who should my young gentleman, his son, fall in love with but my lady, she as fair as a lily and he as dingy as a Creole. How the divil she could fancy such an Indian of a fellow doesn't signify— the Lord forgive me! And so they gets married, and I used to carry letters and messages backwards and forwards between them—I thought then what it would come to. But for all my lady married him to plaise her mother and her jesuite looking husband, I shall niver think she loved him, to her dying day: but this cursed goold will do any thing.” “But how came she in this country?” “Well, I'm going to tell you. This great man, the young man's father that married my lady, was a Spaniard, as I could have tould you before, and his wife was a kin to the Viceroy in this city, and so this Viceroy writes to my master's father to send his son over here, and promised him oceans of goold, but what signifies all their goold whin they're nothing but a parcel of brute bastes after all, with their Inquisition, and all their cursed doings, burning paiple alive, God forgive me! many's the time I've wondered that the earth don't open and swallow them up.” “And so you and your lady come here after her marriege?” said I, wishing to confine Dennis to the thread of his story. “No indeed! my lady would do no sich a thing, for she stood to it, to the bitter end, that she would never laive her mother, poor woman! I shall never forget it, her mother died, and so she didn't care where she went to, and set sail with her husband, my present master, for this city.” “And your present mistress—was she born in Portugal or in this city?” “I'm going to tell you—she was born here. And a fine boy, the very spirit of his mother, died crossing the ocean. Ah! that was a sight, to see my lady when the dear little craiture was a dying. And so he died and my lady had the corse brought here and buried in the garden where she was buried herself—rest her sowl! She died on michaelmas day, in the morning, and laid her Irish bones in this country; and never will I forget the charge she gave me about her child.” “And you accompanied your mistress to this inhospitable country?” “Indeed, and I did that very thing; I would have followed her to the worlds end. We came very near it anyway; for we had all lik'd to have been cast away on the passage.” “And would you not like to visit your native country again?” “Oh, maybe I wouldn't like to lay my bones there— and my lady has a warm liking to Ireland, too; but laive her I never will—she would break her heart. The very last word her mother spake (I was sitting by her bed-side) was, “Dennis, while you live, never forsake my child.” “And how old was her child when she died?” “Three years and nine months. She will be seventeen years old, come Easter Monday, next. But as I was saying: my lady was never well. The first time 6 she set foot in this city I think she was crossed with love. Many's the time she and I would talk about Ireland, and the beautiful green meadows, and the birds, and the jackdaws, and kape me up the live long night, telling stories about ghosts, and spirits, and fairies, and all them there things. `Ah! Dennis,' she would say to me, `how much happier would I have been with Sir William O'Nale, in Ireland. You remember him, Dennis?' says she. And why shouldn't I, says I, when many's the copper he gave me to buy ginger-bread? When you would take me to walk with you in the grove, who should we pop on but sir William? and you would say `Not a word, Dennis!' “Faith, I was no fool; I was no tell-tale. Poor Sir William! never shall I forget how he looked whin my lady and he parted. I could a tould the reason, but I'd a cut my tongue out first. Manny a sly notion I've had, that her mother took her away for fear she would marry Sir William; and I shall ever think she loved him to her dying day. But I wouldn't be after telling tales out of school.” “And has your young lady always lived here?” “Why sure, no; she lived here—but thin she wint abroad to git her edication; and her father payed great respect to her mother; and promised to tache her all the languages, and to let me go with her wherever she wint; and so I wint with her to London, and Paris, and Spain, and Lord knows where, besides. We was gone three years, and thin she brought two of thim gloomy sort of heathens with her over here, to larn her music and other things. Why, I'd as as lief see her with the divil as to see her with those masters of hers. A body's afear'd to spake, where they are, the cursed cut throats! lookin for all the world like the inquisition; and I don't think my lady likes a bone in their skin. How should she?” Dennis paused for the first time—willing to protract his visit as long as possible, I enquired if he had ever been married himself. “Lord love your sowl! d'ye think I would go for to marry one of them savage paple, and to mix my blood with such heathens? No, and I hope my lady will niver marry, while she lives; without she marrys somebody that's more like a christian human,” giving me a significant look at the same time. He sighed deeply as he rose to depart, and bidding me good night, proceeded to lock and unlock the ponderous doors of my dungeon. I pass over the intervening time, which was spent in reading, in the hearing of Wilson, that he might receive the same amusement that I enjoyed myself. Next morning Dennis came earlier than usual, and brought with him the necessary implements for shaving; also a warm and comfortable breakfast, which was sent, as he informed me, from his lady's own table. After having shaved and breakfasted, Dennis removed my bed, (which was nothing more nor less than a bundle of hay,) and replaced it with a quantity of fresh grass, which had been cured in the sun for the purpose. This was to me a delightful improvement; the hay being intermingled with flowers of most exquisite odour, a bed of down would not have been half so acceptable. After expressing my thanks, to Dennis, for his kindness on the occasion, he replied, that what he had done, was in obedience to his master's orders; and that the same had been ordered for Wilson. Dennis remained some time, and continued to amuse me with his lively conversation; but at length, took his leave. Whilst he was unfastening the door of my dungeon, I enquired of him, whether I was to have a visit from his mistress that day. He replied, that she dared not venture to see me until midnight, when every one was asleep; that if it were known, it would go near to affect her life—or in words to that amount. “Sure you wouldn't like to hear that; but harm shall never come on her, while Dennis has blood in his veins. I'll see my lady safe, I warrant ye: let me alone for that.” After he left me, I threw myself on the bed of hay, with better feelings than I had enjoyed since my imprisonment; and had it not been for the deplorable condition to which my sister would be reduced, I should have resigned myself to my fate without a murmur, let that be what it might. But she haunted all my waking hours; but complaint was useless, and indeed I went so far as to indulge in some pleasantries, for the sole purpose of cheering Wilson, whose distress was even greater than my own. I would, however, often beguile him of laughter while reading Sterne's Tristram Shandy: particularly that part of it where Doctor Slop was defeated in his efforts to untie the bag—and my uncle Toby's reply to Slop, after the tedious oath against Obadiah. But I pass over the various occurrences of the day, and that part of the night preceding the arrival of Donna Leanora. Between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I heard the rattling of keys and the shrieking of hinges; my heart at the moment beat as though it would fly out of my body, and before I could collect my thoughts sufficiently to meet the occasion, Dennis entered my dungeon, followed by two females covered by long black veils. I made shift to get on my feet, and saluted them with all the respect I could command—addressing myself to the principal, who was pointed out to me by Dennis, as he officiously whispered, “now all the world over did you ever see her match.” I told her I was informed by Dennis of of this honour, and that words were a poor channel to convey the high sense I entertained of her humanity; that she had laid me under eternal obligations, for the interest she had taken in my distress—“But ceremony, madam,” said I, “in such a place as this would be misplaced, and unseasonable, and particularly to one whose noble actions are their own reward.” As I expressed myself thus, I invited her and her attendant to take a seat on the hay, which she accepted without the least hesitation, while I stretched myself at their feet. Dennis having set something which he carried under his arm in one corner of the dungeon, likewise seated himself flat on the floor. Leanora looked round and seemed to shrink instinctively; the deep gloom of these dreadful dungeons, some fathoms under ground, damp and dismal, would appal the stoutest heart; and yet this female, led by the goodness of her heart, regardless of the consequences, had dared to visit me in this place at the dead hour of the night, to minister comfort, and assuage my sufferings, when my limbs were lacerated with the chains, and death in all its horrors threatened my existence. Leanora was, indeed, beautiful; but the surrounding objects formed such a striking contrast to her person, that I would suppose she never appeared to more advantage.—She was tall, slender and elegantly formed: her features (as near as I could distinguish through her vail) were regular—her face of an oval cast, which was diffused with a deep crimson blush—her complexion was dark, her hair and eyes were jet black, but there was still something in her countenance that I am unable to describe—it was something not earthly, and unlike any thing I had ever seen before. She was dressed in black, which was embroidered with gold—her veil was of the same costly materials: in short, both exceeded any thing I had ever seen of the sort for richness and beauty. She expressed herself in terms of undisguised frankness, and deplored the rigidness of the government, which she said, knew no mercy nor set bounds to cruelty, and added that no language could express the sorrow she felt for me whilst I was sick, and never ceased to intercede with her father till the rigour of my treatment was mitigated. I told her “I had neither father nor mother to lament after me, but I had a sister.” I was unable to add another word for some time, when I proceeded—“that will be left poor and friendless should my captivity affect my life, of which I am under some apprehension;” here she eagerly interrupted me and said my life was safe—“that no design of that nature was meant by the government, but that frequent depredations being committed by your people of late, and no proof hitherto could be obtained of the facts, you are detained in custody to convince your government (who had always disclaimed it) of the truth of those charges: at least, I have been so informed by my father—who informed me that a messenger has been dispatched to your government with an account of your intrusion and capture.” Finding myself arraigned as a criminal by my fair friend, I summoned my resolution to reply; the justness of the charge and the eloquence with which it had been made, required a prompt and definite replication. I declared to her my innocence, and “that, let the object of my superiors be what it might, I was totally ignorant of it until 6* about the time I was made prisoner, and that a disinterested friendship for a young man was the principal cause of my misfortune, and that when we discovered the object of our party we separated from them and determined to return to our own country, when we were unfortunately made prisoners by the Spaniards. This was really and religiously true. “You have a sister then, said she, I feel for her, she must lament your loss, but I hope you will soon be liberated, and epend upon me as a friend. I shall continue to exert all the influence I have in favor both of you and your friend. But I must remind you that our people are cruel and vindictive—our laws are rigid and enforced without mercy—meantime I shall continue to send you some nourishment daily, though I am in great terror lest it might be discovered—you might lose your trusty Dennis, and bad will be your case then indeed. On my father's account you have nothing to fear, but should it come to the ears of government it would go hard even with him. He has had a trial of the same nature heretofore, though it was before my memory.—My mother, it seems, persuaded him to favor some unfortunate prisoner or criminal (I don't recollect which,) and he like to have paid dear for his conduct; but so long as your life is reported to be in danger, so long you may expect a continuation of your present treatment.—Your friend I am told is likewise unwell—my father will send Dennis to see him to-morrow, this he has orders to do lest you might die in prison and involve them perhaps in a war. They will, however, treat you with little kindness; they will do every thing but take your life, and that they dare not do.” Finding she paused, I begged of her to intreat her father to let us have more air, as it was indispensable to our health. She answered that she would, and after exchanging a few more remarks she withdrew, saying she would call on Wilson the next night. To make any comments on the conduct of this magnanimous female would be superfluous, led by humanity alone to venture in the dead of night into a loathsome prison to visit a stranger who was represented as an enemy to her country, is perhaps without a parallel. After her departure, I communicated the substance of our interview to Wilson, the most of which, however, he overheard, and having read some time was in the act of preparing for sleep, when I discovered the bundle I had seen Dennis lay in the corner of my cell. It proved to be a change of clean linen and other clothes which delicacy no doubt forbid Leanora to mention. Next morning Dennis came as usual, and informed me that he had orders from his master to visit Wilson also, take him clean clothes and shave him, and that he had orders to throw all the doors open except the iron grates. My astonishment was never more excited than when the light burst down upon me from an immense distance, almost over my head!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. Thus we continued with little alteration in our treatment for three months, which appeared three hundred to me! One afternoon, however, I heard the door open, and thinking it was Dennis, I turned to look at him, when I beheld not Dennis, but two men whom I had never seen before with no very favourable indications to judge from their looks. They appeared, however, to be people of distinction, and speaking to me in the Spanish language, enquired who brought me the books or how I acquired them: but I made them no answer, although I understood them perfectly, having learned a little of the language from Dennis and from books which were sent to me by his mistress. They stayed but a few minutes, and in the course of an hour, by which time it was nearly dark, four other men came in armed. These brought with them a heavy plank, and laying me forcibly on my back, chained me fast to the plank so that I could move neither hand nor foot. In order to ascertain whether or not I was to be starved to death, I pointed to some food and desired something to eat; but whether they understood me or not is immaterial, for they gave me none. These savages not satisfied with this act of cruelty shut all the doors and retired. Next morning, about ten o'clock, a fierce looking Spaniard came to me and fed me (or attempted to do so) with a spoon, but I refused to swallow the wretched stuff, which was a mixture of red pepper and fat of some description! He gave me a few spoonfuls of water and then retired. Wilson had likewise been visited by the same men who first visited me, but though they had shut him up in darkness and changed his food to bread and water, he was still unchained. I suggested, however, the possibility of his suffering a similar fate, as these barbarians seemed to delight in cruelty. His liberty, however, gave me some consolation, although I was myself dying of hunger and thirst. I charged him to guard with the strictest care our place of communication in the wall, lest a discovery might subject us to still worse treatment, if worse could be. My cruel keeper appeared no more that day, and I suffered beyond description both for food and water. Next morning he brought me the same fare he had done the preceding day and some water, which last I desired him by signs to give me in the first place, but the monster gave me but a few spoonsful before he left off and proceeded to feed me with the nauseous stuff already mentioned, which hunger had converted into palatable food. Thus was I used by these detestable cold blooded Spaniards, with little abatement for three months. But I shrink from the task (even at this distance of time) to recapitulate such unheard of cruelty; how nature sustained such immeasurable calamities is incredible. In the meantime, I was again attacked with a fever, which was attended with such dangerous symptons that the tyrants unbound me: of this, however, I had not the least recollection, being as formerly deprived of my reason. Upon recovering my senses, the first thing I saw was Dennis and a tall figure dressed in a black gown, which I took to be a priest; he was in the act of addressing something to the D—l no doubt, as God could have nothing to do with such a religion as their's. “Our Holy Religion” was all that I could understand. As respects the sanctity of his religion, I leave the world to judge. He was standing over me with his hands spread out, while Dennis, the good old man, was anointing the wounds inflicted on my arms and legs by the chains. After muttering something which I did not understand, the priest withdrew. “Ah!” said Dennis, “it is a netarnel shame to sarve a christian like a brute-baste, they would no more do sich a thing at home thin they would make me king of Ingland—Oh, the jezziuites for to go for to massacre a body alive and to cut the flesh off the bones, they are nothing but a parcel of hathens that ought to be extreminated off of the face of the earth.” “I think as you do,” said I, “Dennis, how do you do my friend?” “And is it you that's spaking, and I'm glad to hear that, why lord love your sowl and honour, you have been a dying these two months, and starved to death and raving and not able to howld up your head and famished.” I interrupted him to enquire about his mistress and Wilson, and how I came to be unbound—“Och! my-stars, if you had seen my lady how she was distracted all the time. She says she won't live in a country that the divil himself would-nt live in, and sure it was I that arged her on. I tould her about the green meadows and the fares and the beautiful locks and growves in Ireland, and says I to her, if you was to see that country my lady, you would never live in this here savage land.” Welcome as was the appearance of Dennis and the sound of his voice, yet his tedious manner of coming to the point was provoking, and bringing him back to the question, he immediately mounted his hobby again. “The man that kept the prison came to our house one day, and so I ups and axes how you was—Says he to me, my trouble will soon be over—Why the lord presarve me, says I, the man aint agoin to die—I hope so, said he, it will be better for him to be out of his misery at once—Holy Virgin, says I, and my measter ought to know that.” “And it is to your kindness I owe my life,” said I “Stop till I tell you; where is the lint? I'me sure I had it just now,” said Dennis, engaged in binding up my sores, seemingly unmindful of what he was going to say. “Och, there was the terriblest rout ever you see; my master was had up before the Audinus, and had like to a bin sint across the ocean to Spain, and thin there was my lady a breaking her heart, and could'nt ate for grafe itself. Och! there was the terriblest hubbleshoo ever you heared in your born days. The first of my knowin, here comes a parcel of great he fellows with pistols and cutlasses and drags my master out of his house, and my lady a hangin to him and scraming and begin for to go with him. Calling to me, Dennis, where are you, said she, and there was I between hawk and buzzard, and so behold ye, to make short of a long story, in the very hithe of the fray here comes orders from the Spanish Consul in the States, not to lay the weight of their finger on ye or they would be made to smoke for it; and so my lads was obliged to come too. But do take a drop of this wine, it 'ill help to strengthen you and hale your inside.” “My outside I think is in more need of healing,” said I. “And you may well say that, for you was fairly rotten, matchless alive! if you had a knowed what a pickle you was in when I took you in hand, and my lady come to see you, and nointed your sores with balsam, and put lint on them and helped me to wash them, that's a lady for you—catch them divils a doin sich thing, no they'd rather cut your throat.—And if you had seen how cast down she was, `Dennis,' says she, `save his life, if he dies I shall never know a happy hour.' “But for the love of God never let-on that I tould you a word, for she would be displased with me if she knew that. Plase fortune but I wish you were out of this cursed place, and if it should turn out as they say, that you are a great man and you and my mistress should—Well, it doesn't signify talking—but after all, sich things has happened, and I should be rejoiced—for thin we could lave this country, and I might stand a chance to see my native land once more. But this is all between ourselves: if it wasn't for my lady I wouldn't care a haperth to lave it to night.” “But you havn't told me a word about Wilson yet, Dennis, is he well?” “Aye, you may well ask that whin he's bin in a dale of trouble about you, and has bin sick too, but he's well now, because I wint to see him every day, and carry him victuals, since the orders I bin telling you about, come. The orders said how one Bonnypart was married to his cousin, and that he would make war upon the country, and pull an old house over their heads, and play hob, and be the ruination of us all. And I tould my lady that you was attached to the young man—or maybe I should a said he was attached to you: but I declare you look like a shadow—do ate something.” “Well, proceed Dennis,” said I. “Well, I tould my lady that you were sworn friends, and I'll be bound,” says I, “if the young man gets out of prison by the help of this Bonnyface, (or whatever his name is) he'll never laive his friend in the lurch—if he did, he ought to be hanged “The poor sowl grieved sore enough about you, and said the whole States would be upon them and take away their country—Lord sind how soon!” Being somewhat gratified to learn that Government had interfered in our favour, I enquired of Dennis what figure that was standing over me when he came in. “Love your sowl, it was father Antonio; my lady tould him about you, and that you was a dying, and begged him to come and see you. She wouldn't for the world, that you should die without a praist, and so he came.” “I thank your lady, Dennis, but I have no faith in these priests.” “My lady wouldn't like to hear that, thin, for she thinks the world and all of father Antonio.” Not willing to enter into an argument with this warmhearted Irishman, upon the subject of a religion which held its votaries in such abominable ignorance, converting the most sublime truths into the most palpable falsehoods,—I enquired what had become of my cruel keeper. “Oh, the divil may care what is become of him! not to give you an ill answer—I dont know, but my lady and my master will be rejoiced to hear that you are getting over it, and your honour had better be shaved and put on some clane clothes and smart up a little. And my lady will be here too, for she niver missed a day since I had the management of matters.” Finding myself too feeble to converse, I told Dennis I would try to sleep a little, and to come in the course of an hour or so, when I would try to be shaved and dressed. After he left me I called Wilson, several times, but received no answer: and thinking that perhaps he was asleep, I gave myself no uneasiness, and fell into a sweet slumber. In the course of an hour Dennis returned, and several other men with him. Perceiving from the smile in Dennis' countenance, that something had occurred in my favour. I felt no apprehension on the appearance of the strangers. “Plaise fortune,” said Dennis, “you may be lifted up[2] [2] “Lifted up,” is an Irish phrase, indicating joy. now, this is the gentleman,” said Dennis to the men, “you'll have to take him aisy, for he's as sore as a piece of beef.” Dennis, assisted by the others, took hold of me in the tenderest manner, and carrying me out of the dungeon, placed me on a carriage, or rather a bier, and conveyed me into a clean comfortable apartment, where, to my great surprise, I found Wilson. We were soon left to ourselves and mutual congratulations followed. Our raptures were such, upon this sudden and unlooked for change in our treatment, that our recent calamity appeared to be a dream. Wilson, though emaciated, and much wounded by the chains with which he had been loaded, was not in so deplorable a condition as myself. It plainly appeared that the same vindictiveness had not been extended to him which had to me: from what reason, neither of us, from that day to this have been able to discover, unless it was the overwinning kindness of the Intendants daughter in combining with Dennis to suppress the news of my recovery, after my first illness. Our prison, for we still were in one, was lighted with windows, and furnished with beds, chairs, tables, and looking-glasses. In short, we lacked nothing but our liberty to make us happy. In a short time two servants entered with wine and other suitable refreshments, followed by Dennis with clean clothes, water for washing, and razors for shaving. After partaking, together, of the good things that were brought to us, we underwent a thorough cleansing; and with the assistance of Dennis got off our beards, which were full four inches in length: being informed by Dennis that his master, the Intendant, was to pay us a visit that evening. After putting our room in order, he and the other servants withdrew. In the meantime Wilson related to me the particulars which had occurred during my last sickness, and the occasional incidents connected with it—as follows: 7 “On the day that you were so barbarously chained down to the floor of your dungeon, the same merciless crew visited me; they stormed at me, in their language, so loud that I was stunned by the noise. They seized the lamp, which was burning at the time, blew it out, and chaining me to the ring in the wall, left me hardly room enough to stir. They then left me, sending nothing but bread and water ever since. But my distress on my own account was nothing, compared to that which I felt on yours. I continued to console and amuse you until you became insensible to every thing.” In the evening we were visited by the Intendant, who was a tall, slim, straight figure, between forty and fifty years of age, of a very dark complexion, his face oval, his visage thin, his eyes small and black, his countenance mild and pleasing, though he saluted us rather stiffly.— He addressed us in the English language and enquired after our health. Supposing that he had a share in the mitigation of our punishment, we, (at least I did) strove to suppress the heartfelt grudge which rankled in our bosoms—it would have been dangerous to vent our displeasure at proceedings, over which this man, perhaps, had no controul. We replied to his enquiries in terms of politeness: and he on his part lamented that it fell to his lot to augment our misfortunes, but hoped they would soon be at an end. The first opportunity that offered, I enquired “whether he had heard any thing, lately, from Spain or the United States, respecting our captivity?” He replied. “That he had seen a letter from the Consul resident of his Catholic Majesty, stating expressly, that we must be detained in custody until further orders; but must be treated with mildness, and debarred from nothing to render our situation comfortable—that it was in consequence of this mandate that we had been removed to our present place of confinement, and that it was the first and the only official instructions they had received.” I asked him “if he was aware of the cause which gave rise to the inhuman treatment I received after my first illness?” but he appeared (and no doubt was) ignorant of the cause. He said the orders came exclusively from the audiance, that he himself narrowly escaped disgrace for conniving at the mitigation extended to us in our confinement. though he was totally ignorant of the particular circumstance which gave offence. “He had” he said, “represented to the audiance that one of the prisoners was sick, and perhaps dangerously so. I was then ordered to take off your chains and send some one, who understood your language, to attend you until you recovered. I therefore sent a domestic of my own, upon whose fidelity I knew I could depend. And whatever it was that gave offence to the officers of the Government in your case, must have been done by this man, for I went no further than simply to comply with my orders.” Wilson asked to be furnished with pen, ink, and paper, and for leave to write to his friends. To this the Intendant replied, “That he had no orders either to permit or restrict us from writing: but was charged to suffer no communication between us and any person whatever, without leave from the Viceroy. But,” said he, “you can write what you wish, provided you allow me to submit the substance to the audiance.” Upon enquiry respecting the time we might expect an answer, should we despatch a letter that week, he informed us it would be three months, at least. After some desultary conversation he took his leave, assuring us that every attention would be paid to our ease and comfort. Wilson and I were surprised at the silence and neglect of our friends, though doubtless it was through them that our imprisonment had been softened. For myself, I had no friends to interfere, but I flattered myself that Wilson's father would undoubtedly hear of his son's captivity, and hazard every thing to relieve him. While we were indulging in vain conjectures on this unaccountable conduct of our friends, the door opened and Captain T. stood before us!!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. When we reflect on the distance from Tennessee to the city of Mexico, the circumstances under which our companions set out on their return, their ignorance of the country through which they passed, the deep rivers, and a thousand other obstacles, it requires a considerable effort of the human mind to account for the sudden appearance of Captain T. at Mexico. It may naturally be supposed his presence inspired us with new life, nothing could equal the transports of the meeting—a restoration to our friends and country could not have been more welcome for the moment. He was accompanied by the Intendant, (who, it appears, was afraid to trust us together unless in his presence) and likewise a strong guard, which stood at the door. But so great was our joy that we were insensible of every other object. Captain T. had a letter from Wilson's father, inclosing one thousand dollars, which he asked permission to deliver, but this master-jailor observed, “That his instructions went to prohibit any correspondence between the prisoners and other individuals, without leave from his superiors; but he would take the first opportunity of submitting the case to them. He would go, probably, that evening, and we should know the result early the ensuing day.” After a few moments conversation with our friend, he and the Intendant departed—the latter assuring Wilson that he would not fail to perform his promise respecting the letter. Our misfortunes now wore a brighter face, and we spent the evening and most of the night with feelings to which we had long been a stranger; though the image of my sister, (in spite of my attempts to be happy) was always present to my mind. And the less I suffered on my own account the more I felt on hers.— Wilson was suffering the same tortures, perhaps worse, on the same account. Dennis having provided us with a chess-board, we amused ourselves most of the time at chess; which, in some degree, helped to beguile the time. We had often played in happier times, but the pleasure it afforded us now was embittered by recalling past scenes to our minds. Thus we passed the succeeding day without seeing or hearing from our friend or the Intendant. Dennis, who brought us our meals, could give us no information respecting them, and we began to be seriously alarmed for the safety of Captain T. We still flattered ourselves that we should certainly see him before bed time. It was now dark, our supper came, ten o'clock came—but the Intendant and Captain T. came not! Ascribing the delay to some accident, we sat until long after midnight, musing in silence most of the time, at one time fancying that evil had befallen Captain T., and at another buoyed up with the hope that morning would come and clear up the mystery. Morning at length came, but long ere it dawned Captain T. was far beyond the reach of the swiftest horse in Mexico!—Dennis appeared with our breakfast rather earlier than common. I saw by his countenance at the first glance that something was the matter. “Here, read this, quick:” said Dennis. I snatched it out of his hand and read as follows:— “Dearest Friends.—I leave you suddenly: I shall be apprehended if I stay longer: an angel here will tell you all—be comforted; I will effect your ransom, at every hazard: I am gone: I have no fear of being taken if I can only mount my horse[3] [3] The Mexicans have been called Spaniards throughout the work, to distinguish them from the variety of other descriptions of people inhabiting Mexico. .” To our enquiries respecting the flight of Captain T. Dennis replied that his mistress understanding that officers were sent by the Viceroy's order to apprehend him, she gave him notice of his danger, and he immediately disappeared. “My lady will come to see you about midnight, and tell you all about it, and she has letters and things—But I wouldn't stand talkin'—give me that paper back again, I must take it to my lady, she charged me strictly, to 7* fetch it back to her, as it would be a dale of harm to her and you too, if it was found out—and says she to me, bring it back, Dennis, we'll make sure work of it.” There was much foresight and wisdom in this suggestion, and I returned him the paper, (it was written apparently in haste, with a pencil.) I was exceedingly hurt at this unexpected departure of Captain T.—having fully determined to write by him to my sister. The opportunity was now lost forever, nor were we without fears that he might not escape.—But Leanora is to visit us at midnight. Midnight, however, though slow was sure, and with it came Leanora. She was preceded by the faithful Dennis, who cautiously blinded the windows to prevent discovery. Unembarrassed and modest, Leonora entered, attended by her virtues only: she saluted us with much seeming concern, and enquired with much tenderness after our health. She then drew from her bosom a paper, which she handed to Wilson, and seated herself between us. The paper contained the letter with the money sent to Wilson by his father, and was itself a manuscript of some length. Wilson opened the letter eagerly and read as follows: “Dear Henry.—You will receive this by Captain T., who has undertaken to visit you and learn your true situation. Your captivity has afflicted us with the deepest sorrow; your mother is unconsolable and refuses to be comforted. Our Government is negociating your ransom, which is attended with much difficulty; but I expect it will soon be brought about: if them Spanish dogs don't cut your throat or something worse, you will receive one thousand dollars. If that will set you at liberty I shall think it well laid out. I am in too much trouble to say more. Your Affectionate Father, T. WILSON.” The other letter being too long to read for the present, we postponed it to hear what news Leanora had to relate respecting the flight of Captain T., when she related the following particulars: “You will recollect, said she, that my father promised to see the Vice Roy and ask his permission for your friend to deliver the letter; he promised you he would go that evening and accordingly he went, but was unable to get an audiance that evening. After his return he came into my parlour, as he always does when he concludes the business of the day. Whilst he was talking in a careless manner, and growing sleepy he yawned and observed, “I am afraid we are to be troubled with another prisoner.” I enquired “who, where and how?” He then related the circumstance of your friend's visit, and said from what he could understand, he would not be allowed to depart the country. This was the first I had heard of his arrival. I said very little then, but determined within myself to effect his escape if possible, if he was not already in custody. Accordingly when my father retired, I sent for Dennis to know where the young man was, but Dennis could give me no information; he had seen him, or at least a man that he took to be him, walking with his master late in the evening, but that was all he knew of the matter. I was seriously alarmed, expecting it was over with him perhaps by that time. I sent Dennis, out, however, to see if he could make any discovery, but to no purpose. Yesterday about ten o'clock he came to our house, and Dennis who was standing centry on the outside of the gate, knew him immediately and brought him privately to me, when I apprized him of his danger. He said if he was once on his horse they might catch him if they could. But I advised him not to leave the city till dark; but how to conceal him was the question, as every house would be searched, and finally sending my woman abroad on some pretence, I desired Dennis to conduct him to my chamber where he locked the door and gave me the key. Had he not taken shelter the moment he did, he must have fallen into the hands of his enemies, as they came to the house a few minutes afterwards in company with my father, who had just returned from the Vice Roy. My father after making enquiry of the servants whether they had seen the stranger (which of course they had not) desired the guard to wait at the gate and apprehend him as he came in, as he was expected shortly, to hear the result of his petition respecting the letter. They watched there the whole day, and another party way-laid the prison expecting he would attempt to see you. Dennis and I had a difficult part to act, and though the odds were against us we determined to effect his escape if possible. The first thing to be done was to ascertain from the stranger where his horse (upon which he seemed to stake his safety) was to be found. This by his direction was done in the course of the day by Dennis. The stranger continued in my chamber till dark and then withdrew privately to his horse, which Dennis had prepared for him. On taking leave of me he handed me the papers and begged me to convey them to you, adding that if he could get but half an hour the start of his enemies he defied them, as his horse was the fleetest of his kind. My father was much concerned at his disappearance, and took an active part in the pursuit which was immediately set on foot. Lights were procured and diligent search was made throughout the city to discover the way he had taken. The whole city was alarmed and patrols dispatched after him in all directions, these have returned without making any discovery, and I hope he is out of danger. “Incomprehensible lady,” said Wilson, “how much do we owe you: can we ever requite kindness like yours?” We united in expressions of gratitude and admiration, but generosity like hers sets language at defiance. “When we forget you, madam,” said I, “may heaven forget us.” She said he took the road to Vera Cruz, at which place he informed her a vessel waited for him, the same which brought him from the United States. After her departure we looked at the manuscript, and eagerly perused the following narrative: “We, your unfortunate companions, were seriously afflicted at your sudden disappearance on the day of our separation in —. At one time we thought you were lost in the forest, and again that you had abandoned us with design, and some there were amongst us that suggested the truth as we afterwards discovered. The circumstance gave us infinite pain, and myself not the least: when morning appeared, you came not. We came to an immediate resolution to go in search of you in a body, thinking it imprudent to separate. Accordingly we traversed the forest that day without making any discovery, till about sundown, when we came upon the trace of horses. We took the back track and proceeded but a short distance before we discovered the place where you were apprehended. This was confirmed by a pistol found at the place, and pieces of cord fresh cut with a knife; the pistol we knew belonged to the horsemen whoever they were, being different from any in our possession. The trampled appearance of the ground, all taken together left little doubt of your captivity. We turned about with all haste, and taking the trace of the horses pursued it till dark, when we could no longer discern the trace, we stopped for the night, resolving to renew the pursuit in the morning at all hazards, breaking our fast for the first time that day upon the fruit that spontaneously grew near our encampment and quenching our thirst from a small rivulet of bad tasted water at the same place. We set forward by the dawn of day and continued to pursue the trace of the horses till noon, when it brought us to a small village—at this place we learned your fate from the inhabitants, who were principally Indians. No language could depict our sorrow at this intelligence, the truth of which we had too much reason to believe. We now held a counsel, in which it was unanimously agreed to abide by the opinion of the majority—the result was that we should procure what provisions the village afforded either by force or fair means, return home with all possible despatch, and exert every means in our power to procure your ransom. We found no difficulty in procuring as much provision as each man was able to carry, consisting of Indian corn and yams; we laid down the money which the inhabitants did not refuse, and set out for home. The Indians at the village informed us (in the course of our short interview) that a large body of Spaniards were in the woods in search of us. This intelligence was sufficient of itself to quicken our march. We travelled that day, the succeeding night, the next day and half the ensuing night without sleep, expecting momentarily to be overtaken by the Spaniards. Being unable to support the want of sleep any longer, we lay down about midnight. I had but stretched myself on the ground when I heard the trampling of horses, and (as I thought) men talking; as the noise was only heard by myself, I ascribed it to a disturbed mind, but a few moments proved it to be no phantom, the trampling and voices being distinctly heard by the whole party. Convinced that it was reality, I desired every man to make ready—the sound was not immediately in our rear—it appeared to be on our right—the night was dark, the sky being overcast with clouds, and lest our fire might betray us, we sprung to our feet and moved obliquely a few hundred yards lest they might stumble immediately upon us. We moved with the utmost silence and fell on their rear: the noise soon died away and laying down we slept sound till morning. We had intended to rest that day and parch corn for our journey, but the occurrence of the night induced us to change our resolution, and we pursued our journey sufficing our hunger with fruit which we plucked as we walked along—we charged our guns afresh and determined to oppose force by force and fight to the last man, should we be attacked. It was not long before our courage was put to the trial; before ten o'clock we were overtaken by about two hundred Spaniards on horseback, armed principally with swords and pistols. It is evident from the sequel that these fellows knew nothing of our mode of fighting, or they never would have approached us in the manner they did. They were mounted on mules, and rode up to us at a round trot, calling out as they approached (in their language, to surrender, but we made them no answer except by a volley discharged from our rifles when they were within shot. I called to my men to take good aim and every one kill his man: no sooner said than done. and down fell most of the Spaniards,[4] [4] The “Sober Irishman,” a horse well known the rest fled without firing a shot and even without looking behind them. We charged our rifles and pursued our journey. In the course of the day we came upon a few scattering huts inhabited by Indians; here we halted and parched our corn enough to last us to New-Orleans, to which place we bent our course. We were not so confident of our valour as to neglect setting guard whenever we stopped, to prevent surprise. At this place we procured some Buffalo flesh and other refreshments, afraid to use our ammunition for the purpose of providing food. We felt grateful to these Indians who treated us with great kindness and hospitality, and had it not been that the Spaniards might return with a superior force, we should have remained here some time to recruit our strength and spirits, but the idea of subjecting ourselves to the necessity of another engagement, influenced us to continue our journey. These Indians had informed us that there was a great river just before us, (the same that terrified us on our journey to—) and gave us information that by going up the river we would come to other Indians who would furnish us with canoes and aid us in crossing it; they also gave us general directions, which in the end proved very convenient. These were the mildest and most friendly Indians I ever met with, and had it not been for fear of the Spaniards they would have conducted us on our way. In the course of a few hours we arrived at the river, and pursuing their directions we reached the Indians, crossed the river and continued our course for New-Orleans without further interruption from the Spaniards. But to recount to you the hardships we endured from hunger, thirst, fatigue and sickness, would surpass the ordinary power of language. We travelled for days through endless prairies, parched with the sun, and without a drop of water; at another time we would be immersed in swamps up to our middles and almost every man sick. We could have killed enough to satisfy the cravings of hunger, but our whole cry was water, being parched up with fevers. Had you seen us seated on the banks of a prodigious river, while one of us was feebly wielding the axe, for the purpose of constructing a raft, with scarcely strength enough to raise the weight of it. Had you seen us scattered over those boundless forests, some supported by others, as they feebly walked on in search of water, all eloquent with grief at our disappointment, you would have congratulated yourselves upon your not unhappier fate. It is wonderful how we surmounted such a complication of calamities. Perhaps human fortitude never sustained greater. Seven of our number found relief in death. Poor Murray, Herbert, and — fell victims to the scene of misery I have described. We scraped a little earth over them, each envying their happier lot As soon as we arrived in Tennessee, I hastened to apprize Captain Wilson of your situation, advising him to apply to our government immediately to obtain your ransom; nor did I leave him till I saw a messenger dispatched to Washington for the purpose. But the old gentlemen, to say nothing of Mrs. Wilson, would not rest until I consented to visit Mexico to ascertain your real situation. No one would undertake the dangerous task but myself—Howard did once agree to come, by whom I intended to have sent this, but when it came to the test his courage failed him. I expect to remain here until you are liberated. T. The last sentence was written in italics, and it was doubtless his intention. Not to be tedious, it was two full years after this before we heard from our country or friends. At the end of that time, a complete ransom was received for Wilson. None for me! We were thunderstruck and stood in mute astonishment; no letter, no cause assigned. It was as easy to negotiate for two as one; but then I was poor and friendless—Wilson was not. “Never, never will I quit the country without you,” said Wilson, “let come what will.” “Go,” said I, “comfort your father and mother, I have none to lament, abandoned as I am by heaven; I am a wretch unworthy your regard—there is but one object in this world”—here utterance failed me. “Your sister, I know what you would say,” said Wilson. “Yes, had it pleased heaven to take her when it took my parents—But you will see her.” “Urge me not. Until now we were bound in honour to to our female friend here, or to her father (for her sake) to attempt nothing that would endanger his safety.” As Wilson said this we heard footsteps approaching, supposing it to be the officers coming to separate us, perhaps forever. Wilson had but a moment to say, “I will effect your liberty at the risk of my life, before I quit the country—I am determined.” The officers now entered the prison and asking Wilson if he was ready, he gave me his hand in silence and withdrew.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">8 CHAPTER IX. The day that succeeded Wilson's departure was to me the most melancholy of any I had spent during my captivity. I sat the whole day musing upon his last words and revolved a thousand plans in my mind, as favourable to his designs, and as often rejected them as futile. I could think of no plan he could fall on without endangering his own safety—he cannot force the doors without assistance, and that he will not get, for these Spaniards though cruel have a high sense of honour.[5] [5] When they disarmed us they saw that we had money, but never presumed to touch either that or our watches. No alteration distinguished my treatment after Wilson left me. I was attended in the same manner and furnished as heretofore. I now lamented more than ever the absence of my friend Dennis, of whose company we had been deprived for several months; he had been superceded by another keeper—in fact, he never attended us regularly after we regained our health, but generally called to see us once or twice a week. We often enquired of our keeper what had become of him but he could give us no information on the subject. The Intendant had called a few times to see us, but I never saw Leanora after the night on which she brought us the papers. On the fourth night after Wilson's release, about midnight my door began to rattle and shook frightfully and finally flew open and Wilson entered in disguise: “follow me, quick,” said he. I flew after him as quick as lightning, and in a few minutes we gained the street. Wilson ran with great swiftness, so that it was with difficulty I kept up with him for about two hundred yards, when we met with an obstacle which at once blasted all our hopes. The patrole was going the rounds immediately before us and a light blazing near them; running at the rate we did, we were almost upon them before we made the discovery. We had no possibility of passing them, and all the chance left us was to scale a high wall to our left, which we attempted. Wilson proved successful, but I was discovered and seized just as I had gained the top of the wall. The patrole calling in assistance, I was immediately bound and put under guard until morning. I was questioned by these people as to my name, country, and business; but although I understood them perfectly, (having learned the language) I made them no answer. In the morning it was discovered who I was, and the whole city was in an uproar, the police officers were enraged, I was carried before the audiance and interrogated respecting my escape out of prison. To their questions I made no answer. I was then put to the torture to extort confession, and suffered as much as I ever expect to suffer this side of the grave, without betraying my friend. I was now conveyed to my old dungeon, which was dark and dismal enough. Seneca says, “a wise man stands upright under any weight,” but Seneca himself would have yielded to anguish like mine. I lay on a damp cold floor, bruised and mangled, friendless, cheerless, and comfortless, without light or sustenance, or even a drop of water! All this, added to my fears for Wilson's safety—distraction harrowed my soul! How welcome would death have been to me at that moment! But I draw a veil over this appalling picture, which even at this distance of time chills my heart. I passed that and the succeeding day without food or water. At night I was visited by a man not quite so savage looking as his fellow-tormentors, one whom I had never seen before, he brought me some coarse bread and some water, and setting it near where I lay, was going off without saying a word.—“And can you leave me thus:” said I, addressing him in the Spanish language. “You are a man, can you not feel for the distress of a fellowman?” Finding him disposed to listen I appealed to his sympathy with all the eloquence I could summon to my aid. I pulled out my watch and purse, “here friend,” said I, “take these, it is all my wealth. I have, no use for them, you are welcome to them, and leave me the lamp.” He stood some time and viewed me in silence, and at length replied that be could not, and was turning to go out.— “Oh!” said I, “if you do nothing else, stay with me awhile and cheer me with your company.” He stopped, and after musing some moments set the lamp down. I offered him the watch, but he put it from him and withdrew. I was now comparatively happy, for on looking round my old apartment I discovered the books I received from Leanora, also the ink, pens, and paper: and there stood the bottle of oil too, in the very same place I left it two years before! The books were covered with mould, and were rotten, but the leaves were fresh and sound. It may seem strange, but it is nevertheless true, that time reconciles us to all things, and yet in the first moments of calamity nothing appears more impossible. Seneca and the new testament by turns contributed, in a great measure, to reconcile me to my fate. Had it not been for my fears on Wilson's account, I might have spent my time tolerably, but my liberty and perhaps my life depended upon his safety. I continued in this dungeon about sixteen weeks without any alteration in my treatment, being visited once every day by the same keeper, who was by no means sociable or disposed to conversation. In all this time I never once heard or saw any thing of my friends, Leanora and Dennis. I was, for their sakes, afraid to make any enquiries after them lest it might awaken suspicion. At the end of this time, as near as I calculated, my keeper brought a bottle of wine and a cold fowl, he sat them down and retired as usual. After he left me I drank part of the wine and proceeded to tear the fowl to pieces—when lo! a letter was concealed on the inside! —It ran thus: “Your friend is still here, he has been with me often. He is disguised in the habit of an Indian, and has two fleet horses ready, and now the nights being dark, you may expect him. Heaven grant you may get safe to your country, where you will sometimes deign to think of LEANORA.” I did not venture to indulge in that joy which this circumstance might reasonably be supposed to produce, for though I had something to hope I had much to fear. But the letter threw me into such an agitation of conflicting ideas, that I found it impossible to confine them to any one object, and I passed the day in great perturbation. When night came I never attempted to sleep, but with my eyes on the watch. I counted the tardy minutes. I scarcely allowed myself to breathe that I might catch the first sound of Wilson's approach. The next night was passed still more unpleasant; but on the following, about midnight, I heard the keys turning, and Wilson, though I hardly knew him, entered my prison! I was ready, and without speaking a word followed him out; we wound our way through a narrow alley until we came to a large house: Wilson tapped gently at the door, it was opened by Leanora, who without waiting to salute us turned bastily round and stepped into another room. Dennis followed her out, “Don't delay a moment,' said she, `Dennis will conduct you,” and giving each of us her hand, beckoned us to proceed. We crossed a garden and came to a small gate. Dennis opened the gate: it led into a narrow alley which turned to the left. Pursuing this some distance, we passed several gates and windings, through which Dennis conducted us, and finally led to a house in a remote part of the city. Dennis knocked at the door, which was opened by an Indian, who was equipped for riding. “Come on:” said he, and leading the way, we soon arrived at an enclosure where stood three horses well caparisoned. He mounted one and directed us to do the same. After squeezing the offered hand of Dennis, and sending a grateful message to his mistress, we followed our conductor.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">8* CHAPTER X. We proceeded rather slowly until we were out of the city lest the sound of our horses, whose feet were muffled, might alarm the inhabitants. Upon leaving Mexico we entered upon a narrow track, where we put our horses to their best speed. During all this time I never spoke a word to Wilson nor he to me, neither did our conductor utter a syllable. He would sometimes look behind him as if to urge us on—but we had no need of this hint. Before day-light we had left Mexico far behind. The day was cloudy and therefore I could not distinguish our course, nor did I take the time to ask. We continued our journey all that day and the next night without halting, except for the purpose of drinking and letting our horses drink. As day-light was breaking upon us we discovered a small hamlet at no great distance. Our guide now spoke to us, for the first time, and reining up his horse, which indeed could hardly drag his legs after him, he said, “That we must lie by that day and refresh oursleves with sleep and food; and that the great road leading to Vera Cruz lay near—that it was not in our power to avoid it in either direction on account of the morasses which lay on each side of it; that our pursuers, if there were any, would probably be on towards evening, and by letting them get before us our danger would be less; and that we would set out again about dark.” It was likewise settled that Wilson should array himself in a rich dress, and pass for the superior, while I and the Indian, (our guide) were to be his domestics. This being the arrangement we stopped to equip Wilson.— Leanora had projected this plan, it appeared, and had provided a rich Spanish dress for the purpose. One circumstance afflicted us, that was the length of Wilson's beard. This, however, was to be managed by our guide, who would take upon himself to account for it, agreeably to the enquiry it might excite. All these things being settled, and Wilson dressed up as the master Don, he and the guide walked forward to the village, while I led the horses after them. Although this town was not entirely destitute of wealth yet we found it difficult to procure accommodations. There were a few Spaniards settled in it, but we put up with an Indian. Wilson and myself, after eating some fruit, (no other food could be had) lay down to sleep, upon a mat, while our guide went out to put away the horses, and seek others for the purpose of completing our journey. The place pointed out for our repose was a little garden near the house. The enclosure around it was sufficient to guard us from the view of any one, unless it was entered. Thus being disposed we left every other concern to our guide. When it was completely dark we were called by him to awake and take some refreshment. He had procured a little wine, some bread, and a quantity of delicious fruit, which he brought to us in the garden, and desired us “to eat hearty, as we should get no more until we arrived at Vera Cruz. “We must get there this night,” said he, “and you must take passage the moment you arrive there, or you will be discovered—for your enemies are after you.” “How do you know,” said I, “have you heard of them.” He informed us “that while we slept three horsemen called at the village to get refreshment for themselves and horses, and withdrew, execrating the place in bitter terms, because it could afford them nothing. They came to the very hut we had called at; he met them at the door, and played off the master of the house upon them. They rode off very brisk in order to gain a considerable village on this side of Vera Cruz, where it is probable they will spend the night. If you therefore reach Vera Cruz by day-light, and have the good fortune to find a vessel just going out, you may escape: and if you meet with no vessel, my lady said I must get my uncle who lives there, to conceal you until you can get out safe,” When we had finished our repast we mounted our horses, (not the same, for our trusty guide had provided fresh ones) and setting forward, we were soon in the great road. We travelled briskly on until we came to the town where we supposed our enemies had taken up quarters for the night. We dared not venture to go through it, and every difficulty, almost, opposed our going round. Marshes, brambles, and enclosures, presented themselves in succession. At length, however, we gained the great road, and met with no obstacle until we arrived at Vera Cruz, which we did about two hours before day. We proceeded directly to the house of our guide's uncle, who was a Mestezoe, and who received us with much kindness. Our first business was, to enquire of this man “whether any vessel was in the harbour, and whether a passage could be obtained to Havanna. Our guide, who was the spokesman, observed “that a Don and his servant wished to take passage early that morning.” After pausing sometime the uncle replied, “There are several ships in the harbour, but whither they are bound I cannot say.—I will, however, ascertain that particular as soon as day-light.” In the mean time we took some refreshment. As soon as day broke we proceeded to the harbour, and seeing a boat with three passengers in it, just putting off from the shore, we hailed it: it returned, and we stepped into it without asking or being asked any questions. On our way to the ship our guide, at our instance, asked the passengers “if they were bound for Havanna?” They replied, “that they were bound to Spain, but in all probability they would stop at Havanna.” He asked them “when they would set sail?” They answed “This morning.” I found it difficult to conceal my joy upon hearing this good news, which I perfectly understood. When we arrived at the vessel, we found it quite a small craft, laden principally with logwood. We succeeded in getting a passage, after showing our passport, which Wilson had. It was for himself only, but no notice was taken of me, whom he passed for his servant. No questions being asked, we paid our passage, and bid adieu to our kind friends, after sending a message to Leanora We immediately hoisted anchor, and having a favourable breeze, soon lost sight of Vera Cruz. When a man is in bad luck every thing goes wrong; when it once changes for the better, every thing goes well. It happened that the ship we engaged was a British ship. Had it been otherwise, we might have had some trouble in getting off An opportunity of conversing together having now occurred, Wilson gave me the following account of his anventures from the time of our separation in Mexico: “After your failure to escape over the wall, in my first attempt to liberate you, I ran with my best speed to the house where our late guide joined us two nights since. At this house I had spent the four days that succeeded my release, it being pointed out to me by Leanora, to whom I disclosed my intention without reserve. “This generous Indian was greatly agitated when I informed him what had happened, and after a short pause he said “that I could not remain there, that every house in the city would be searched, and were I found in his house my life would be endangered.” “What was to be done! I proposed to leave the house, at all hazards, and trust to chance for my safety. “I would rather die an hundred deaths than be the means of injuring a single hair of thy head—farewell!” said I, pressing his hand to my heart. “Stop,” said he, “I have thought of something—follow me and do as I do. We will join the pursuers, and by that means deceive them.” “By this time the streets were full of people, some going one way, some another. We ran out and asked what was the matter—joined the tumult, and continued to run hither and thither the whole night. The mob could not give any satisfactory answer when interrogated respecting the cause of the disturbance—some said the city was betrayed, and others, that the States' men had entered the city and carried off some prisoners by force, and that the natives had rebelled and the Viceroy was besieged in his palace. All this was well. When day-light appeared, I returned with my friend to his house, where I lay concealed in a private chamber six days. “At the end of this time I came to the resolution of disguising myself in the habit of a Spanish peasant, and purchasing one of the floating gardens, and pursuing the business of selling flowers to the inhabitants of Mexico until an opportunity offered of effecting your escape.— My friend for this purpose furnished me with a root, with which I tinged my skin of a yellow colour. You recollect my whiskers grew very long while I was in prison. My hair I died black as jet. “Thus disguised I left my kind entertainer one evening and travelled nearly the whole night. By day-light I had gained nearly the extremity of the lake, where those gardens are constructed. But I found it impossible to effect my purpose, from my inability to speak their language correctly. “The owners of those gardens discovered my foreign accent, and evinced evident signs of distrust. They eyed me with suspicious glances, and even hinted that I must be one of those spies of whom they had heard such terrible accounts. I sat down on the bank opposite to them under a shade, and seemed perfectly unconcerned at their conversation—which I appeared not to understand. “Pretending drowsiness I threw myself on the ground, and feigned sleep. I expected that perhaps they would attempt to seize me, but it would have cost them dear, (although there were five of them) armed as I was with two pistols and a dirk I should have set them at defiance. I reproached myself for not foreseeing the danger in which my accent would involve me in personating a Spaniard. I could easily have procured a garden without any risk, through the agency of my kind friend, the Indian, who was privy to my design. “After resting myself sometime I got up and amused myself in sauntering about and picking the wild flowers which covered the banks of the lake, and by degrees I lost sight of the gardeners. The moment I was fairly out of view I mended my pace, nor stopped until I had nearly doubled the lake, it being far advanced in the night before I ventured to rest. At length coming to a rugged cleft of rocks on the margin of the lake, where I could with the utmost security conceal myself, I lay down with my pistol in my hand, lest I might be attacked by wild beasts. Nothing however interrupted my repose, and with the dawn of morning I lodged myself in one of those cavities. Here I resolved to stay until the bustle which this last incident might occasion, was over.—Not to tire you, I lay here two weeks, only venturing out at night to pluck fruit for my sustenance. “Finding myself grow feeble, and being impatient to hear how you were, I ventured one dark night from my hiding place and took the road to the city to see friend Unco, (the Indian's name) and hear the news. I had proceeded but a short distance when it grew so dark that I was unable to discern a single object whatever. It now began to thunder tremendously, and lightened with such rapidity that heaven and earth seemed wrapt in fire—torrents of rain succeeded. “Aided by the lightning I pursued my way with all possible dispatch, it being a good opportunity to enter the city without discovery. At length I reached Unco's door, wet enough, to be sure! but then I needed washing. Unco received me kindly, and was much gratified to find I was still alive and in the country. “He said his lady had often been to his house to enquire after me, and some reported “that one of those outlanders had been seen on the lake, and it made a great noise and strict search was made in that direction.— When the truth was not confirmed the men who spread it were taken up and put in confinement as impostors.” I then asked him if he had heard, lately, from you. He said his lady told him she believed you were well—but confined in the dungeon. “Unco,” said I, “I had like to have been discovered, as you heard, on the lake, going there as I told you to purchase a floating garden—and finally told him that he must conceal me in his house a week or two longer, and purchase for me one of those gardens, for I could not leave the country until I could get my friend out of prison. “The kind creature furnished me with a plentiful breakfast and prepared dry clothes of his own to put on. I offered him money but he generously refused it.— “Now,” said I to Unco, “I will lay down and take a nap, and do you go and tell your lady that I am here and would be glad to see her.” “The next night she came and she and I concerted the plan of your delivery.—I was to procure a garden and go to her house every morning with the flowers. She was to give me a bottle of wine, or money, or whatever she chose I was to be disguised as an Indian and to mix with the domestics at night—have plenty of wine, treat largely, talk broken Spanish, dress in rags, and the first dark night infuse a sleeping dose into the wine, with which I was to ply the keeper who was immoderately fond of the liquor, but dared not let it be known that he drank while on duty. “I continued with Unco about ten days, when I ventured to put my scheme into execution, and every thing succeeded as I wished. I was a jolly fellow at night, (feigning to be drunk) the butt and ridicule of all the domestics—sometimes I would dance the Indian dance, and amuse them with every grimace of countenance and distortion of body I could assume. “Sometimes I would be absent several days: this would heighten their desire to see me. We would on these occasions double the quantity of wine. “At length the propitious night arrived—the first bottle, the second, and a third, were soon emptied, all well charged with the opium. I soon tumbled over, fast asleep as it were, and in a short time the others followed my example. When they were all asleep I stole the keys out of the keeper's pocket, and you know the rest.” Although well pleased to have it in my power to converse with people who understood my native language, (for there were several Englishmen on board) yet I was far from being sure of gaining my liberty. I was in continual dread lest the Spaniards might pursue and overtake us. The master smiled when I observed, “that we went very slow.” “You must have a sweet-heart,” said he, “whom you are in haste to see—we go eight knots an hour.” When we reached the entrance of the Gulf Stream not far from Havana, a violent storm arose, which drove us to the eastward in the direction of the Bahamas. Whilst we were combatting the wind and waves we espied two vessels making down upon us. The boatswain eyeing them through a glass from the mast head, said they were strange looking vessels and he could not tell to what country they belonged. The captain was panic-struck, and shook from head to foot, observing that “we must be near the Bahamas, and it was quite probable the vessels were manned by pirates who infested those seas. If they are, we are gone,” said he, “for we have no metal to oppose them.” We were not left long to conjecture—Taking the advantage of the wind, they bore down upon us like lightning. We attempted to fly before them putting on all sail, but they wheeled before the wind and poured in a broadside before we had time to clear the deck. We made what defence we were able, two guns being all that we had, but never did guns do more execution. Wilson and myself being skilled in artillery, played them off two shots for one: but a shot taking effect in the hull, and our mainmast being carried away at the same instant, we were immediately boarded. Six of our men were killed, and two mortally wounded. Wilson and myself expecting no quarters, determined to sell our lives dear. Taking up a sword that one of our men dropped as he fell, I ran the first man through the body that jumped on deck. Wilson followed my example: he killed the next, I cut off the head of another and wounded several, but being overpowered by numbers who being assisted by the crew from the other ship, we were disarmed, tied and put on board one of the pirate ships. Our captain fell at the first onset, and we had but two men left when the pirates obtained the victory. I was slightly wounded in my right shoulder, Wilson was unhurt. The pirates dispatched the only two beside ourselves that were unhurt—also those that were wounded, 9 their leader observing in the English language that “them other dogs were brave fellows, and would serve them well in a hard gale.” As our vessel was filling fast with water, they hastened to unload her, but found very little that suited them. One small chest of gold ingots, a little silver, the stores, with several chests of clothes, and some spices were all they discovered. This I learned afterwards, for being confined in the hold of their vessel, I saw nothing that passed. The action took place about three o'clock, and that night about one o'clock we were set on shore. Wilson and myself were blindfolded, for what purpose we could not imagine. We spent the night on the beach in a state of wretchedness that would baffle description. The next morning we were placed on mules which were led by the banditti to the distance of two miles, as we supposed. We were then taken from the backs of the mules, led into some secret place, and seated ourselves together on the ground, but ventured not to speak, lest we might be overheard. In the course, however, of an after our arrival, the bandages were taken from our eyes and we found ourselves in a spacious cavern filled with these monsters of iniquity. Amongst them was a female. There were about thirty men around us. They brought us brandy in abundance (of which they drank largely themselves) and likewise victuals to eat; while we were eating I ventured to ask what they designed to do with us. “Why, d—n you,” said the head of the gang (as I took him to be) “if you had your deserts you ought to be shot in revenge for the life of the bravest of our men; you have broke us up. But as you are good metal, you may have your lives if you will agree to take his place and take an oath to be true to the cause, you can have your life upon no other conditions.” “And would you require an oath?” said Wilson. “That's a pretty question,” said he; “I would have doubts even of that, but the moment you prove refractory, d'ye mind, off comes your head with this,” showing a huge sword.—“This is the fellow that never makes mistakes; many a one it has taken off—see, there's the blood on it, hardly dry since it sent a fellow to the other world, as he said, to consider upon the proposal.—He was a brave fellow too, d'ye see, but if you will stay here and partake of our danger you may partake of our wealth too. We get it hard and spend it like princes. Come hand us more brandy—here, Jack, what are you about? bring us plenty—We don't mind this business of killing at all.” said he, addressing himself to me. “I don't like to do it could it be helped, but we are too far in now to retreat: and as I was saying, we are a set of jolly fellows, so if you have a mind you can join us and take pot luck; if not, its do your business, old friend,” said he, pointing to the sword, “and that's an end of the matter.” I saw that remonstrance was useless, and told him that we would take some time to consider the proposal. I then related to him the whole story of our misfortunes, and begged of him to suffer one of us, I did not care which, to continue the voyage home; that were it not for my sister I would rather die than not. “Humph!” said the stern brute, “we have heard too many such stories as yours—but I don't care a ropes-end about it, only you're a couple of brave fellows, I'll say that. You can have your choice—I'll give you till evening to consider upon it.” Then turning to his men, with an air of authority demanded if every thing was safely lodged, and receiving an answer in the affirmative, helped himself to another draught of brandy. Being by this time nearly intoxicated, and becoming drowsy he stretched himself on a pallet and fell asleep. Four men took their station near him with muskets in their hands. They held them between their knees with the but ends on the ground, on which they were seated. Wilson and myself sat and looked at them in a state of mind that may easily be imagined. For my own part, death had no terrors in it for me. I had suffered more than twenty—more than a hundred deaths—why then should I fear one? It was pleasing to me to reflect that my destiny was now fixed and certain.—If I acceded to the terms of the banditti I might have a chance to escape to my country, and if not, I might in death find a release from all my cares; but to take the oath, to bind myself to murder my fellow-creatures—the thought froze my heart. I will not do it, thought I—I will never be a murderer!—God will certainly not desert me; He will not punish a violation in favour of mercy. I therefore resolved to take the oath.— I mentioned this to Wilson in the Spanish language in a low voice, lest I might be understood. He agreed with me, and we said no more. Nothing worth relating occurred during two or three hours, when an incident put an end to all my hopes of life. In asking me for something Wilson called me by name. One of the banditti who had been earnestly looking at me for some time coloured deep and examined me still more earnestly. I fastened my eyes upon him also: he was much disconcerted—his face was familiar to me, I had certainly seen him before, he was an elderly man, about forty years of age. Good God! what was my astonishment: it was Hunter! He was disguised as an Indian, but it proved to be him. I saw in a moment, by his countenance, that whatever Wilson's fate might be, I was devoted to destruction. Be it so then, thought I, I would rather die at once than be in a sea of eternal trouble, and comforted myself with this reflection. What could this monster be doing amongst those robbers? Could he be in alliance with them? But the atrociousness of his character, had they known it, would have rendered him unworthy even of them. A short time after this the head of the band awoke and I was confirmed in my suspicion. The ruffian, Hunter, called him to walk out of the cave. They were absent some time, while I suggested the idea to Wilson, whose grief (for the part he had acted in this last turn of fortune) broke out into tears—but I observed that it must ultimately happen. In about half an hour they returned, and the Captain of the band asking Hunter, “Which is he?” he thus addressed me: “Young man I have revoked your sentence; you are known to one of our party as a traitor, and a dishonourable man, who cannot be trusted. You must die.” “He is a liar, and the blackest of villains:” said I, with spirit—“and may the vengeance of Heaven overtake him; he has ruined my family, he has murdered my father and mother, and now he would murder me.” “You know him then,” said the pirate. “Yes, I do know him.” “This act of duplicity, then, is sufficient evidence against you. You knew him, and were silent.” “I knew him not,” said I, “until the moment he discovered me.” “'Tis useless to say any more,” said the robber, “you die, for if you are right in what you say of him, the greater the danger—so draw up here. Stevens, take a file of twelve, and take this fellow out and despatch him—quick, I say.” I arose, pressed Wilson's hand, and stepped out of the cavern without speaking a word. I walked between six men on each side, perfectly undaunted, with a firm step. I was now soon to be out of trouble, and that was sufficient to reconcile me to my fate. “You are accustomed to this,” said I to one of the men that was next to me. “Yes,” said he, “but I hate to kill a man in cool blood for all that; but we must obey our Captain.” “And are you not afraid,” said I, “that the vengeance of heaven will one day overtake you.” “How much further, Stevens?” asked one of the men. “Just to that rock, there, before us.” At this moment we heard a voice behind us—“Avast, villains!” The men stopped, and looked round, and behold—an armed force stood before the cavern! At the same instant a discharge of musketry brought several of the pirates to the ground. I saw Wilson, the next moment, in the arms of the strangers. He pointed towards us: a large party advanced— “Williams:” cried one of them, and approached us at a running pace. Now, thought I, I shall be killed, to a certainly, eiher by one party or the other; but hefore 9* either party fired, Wilson, (I suspect) interfered, for the strangers called out, to surrender themselves, which they immediately did. Thus was I snatched from the jaws of death. Wilson ran into my arms and sobbed aloud, upon my bosom, while the strangers viewed us in silent amazement. I next aproached my deliverers, and thanked them for my life. “D—n the dogs:” said an old looking veteran, “I wouldn'nt a'missed this, d'ye see, for all Havanna; but I had terrible work to get over these cursed stones.— Why, it's a very d—s den o' a place—I sprained my ankle to boot. “Ferguson, take care of them fellows, and see what's to pay. Oh, Lord, how my ankle hurts me.” “Sambo, where is something? What hast thou brought?” “Here, massa,” handing a bottle. “Well, let's sit down here, and ask these fellows where their spring be, for we can't live here without water.” Sambo, who was a black man, appeared to be the servant of the old soldier, immediately set out to find water, and upon enquiry, of those in the cavern, where it might be found, he returned with a full canteen, which he had slung over his shoulder. While Sambo was absent, the old gentleman enquired how it came to pass that we fell into the hands of those pirates, a circumstance which had been briefly imparted to him by Wilson. After giving him a summary of our imprisonment in Mexico, and the particulars respecting our capture by the pirates, I then related the whole circumstance of Hunter's conduct to my father, and his late attempt upon my life; all of which have already been detailed to the reader. “And where be this Hunter?” said the old gentleman. “Is he amongst the number of the slain?” “I know not,” said I, “I should be sorry, however, if he were.” “Here, go with this man—What be thy name, friend?” “Burlington,” I replied. “Burlington,” repeated he, “What was thy father's ohristian name?” “His name was Charles, sir.” “And he lived in Plymouth, thee says?” “He did, sir.” “It must be he—must be my brother, my name is Burlington. Did thee never hear him speak of a brother he had, by the name of Thomas, who went to sea when a lad?” “My dear uncle,” said I, embracing him, “And is it you that has saved my life—thank God, for he is once more merciful. I did hear him speak of you often, and often has he bewailed your death; for, my dear sir, we heard you were dead.” “That was a mistake, it was a man of the same name, and may be a distant relation; he died in the East Indies; I remember it well, many of my acquaintances were of the same opinion as yourself, d'ye see, that it was me.— Well, poor lad, thou hast seen hard service, as well as thy uncle. Poor Charles, I little thought I should see thee; but the will of heaven be done,” said he, wiping the tears from his cheeks. “Where's the cup, Sambo? Be that good water, thou hast found?” Sambo drew from his pocket a silver cup that held nearly a pint— “Dis good water, me believe, massa—he run out o' one rock.” “Very well, set it down; Sambo, here is a nephy of mine, maybe thee will like to hear that.” “What, nevy, massa?” “Oh, it's just some o' my people—here, give the poor boy something to drink, I'll warrant he is in need,” handing Sambo the cup. “Drink sir,” said I, “and I will pledge you.” He drank first, and then handed the cup to Wilson and me.— The old man desired me to take a guard, and ascertain the number of the slain and prisoners, and see whether Hunter was dead or alive. There were fourteen killed and one just dying of his wounds. Going into the cave, we found Hunter living He refused even to look at me, though I called him by name and asked him what death he expected to die. Upon examining the contents of the cavern, we found an immense quantity of specie, and several ingots of gold, many trunks of clothing, some of which was of the richest quality; besides casks of brandy, rum, molasses, beef, pork, sea-buiscuit, coffee, sugar, butter, and a great quantity of fruit of all sorts. Independently of these articles, we found one of the fair sex, which I mentioned before. Ferguson, who appeared to be my uncle's head man, had confined the prisoners in the inner part of the cavern, amidst the plunder. This part was dark, and separated from the outer part, and communicated with it by a door, which was fastened with a strong iron bar, and with a huge padlock. We turned out our female prisoner, (who had accompanied us with a lamp,) and left her at liberty with Ferguson and his men, who stood guard in the outer room of the cavern. Had she been young and handsome she might have been in some danger; but alas! she was neither the one nor the other. I returned and reported the substance of my discovery to my uncle. “Curse 'em,” said he, “many an honest man's life has paid for their spoil, and yet, hang it, I hate to shed blood. “Go,” said he to his men, “and throw them fellows out o' my sight. I've a notion to take up my quarters on shore to night—What dost thou think boys? Think Jinkins can take care o' the rigging to-night? It seems a still evening, and they say as how there's good cheer aboard.—Avast, there, lend a hand.” Sambo and I both assisted him in rising to his feet. “Ah, child! thy uncle is a poor old crazy vessel— his voyage is almost completed—What do'st think, Sambo, will Jinkins fancy that we're lost?” “Oh, no, massa, he know you can be no loss—I boun' he take care ob de tacklin' one night.” “Well then, boys, we'll go and see what's to eat and to drink.” We assisted the old man in walking to the cavern, with which he seemed much pleased, and observed that “it was a main strong fortress.” He dismissed Sambo, (who, it seems, was his cook, as well as his valet,) to prepare supper, telling him to make the woman assist him.—It appeared that besides the two rooms already mentioned, there was a third, which was the old woman's department. Thither they both repaired to prepare supper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. While supper was preparing, I took occasion to enquire how it happened that they came so providentially to our relief? “Thee's heard,” said the old man, “the old saying: but thee must tell me thy christian name, my son.” “Charles, sir,” said I. “Charles!” repeated he, “yes, that was thy father's name. Thee's heard `that when rogues fall out, honest people come by their own;' so it seems that these fellows fell out among themselves, and so one o' the gang turned king's evidence. That I bethink, it be this same, whatde'call'um. Hunter; stop, where be he that brought us hither?—fellow come forward here—was it not this Hunter that thee sayest brought thee in the lurch?” “Yes, sir,” replied one of the men. “And what be thy name, friend? I fear thee's as bad as any o' um, but thee did a good turn once in thy life, but though dare say didn't intend it.” “My right name, sir, is Horton.” And Horton it was indeed—the same Horton whom my father had taken as a servant into his family, at the instance of Hunter, and who had eloped from Boston suddenly. The reader will recollect that I suspected him of stealing the bonds, which my father held on Hunter. It was evident from the confusion in his countenance, that he recognized me. “Well, as I was saying,” continued my uncle, “this fellow, Horton, and the head o' the gang quarrelled about the booty, and he came and lodged information to the Governor of Havana. I happened to be sitting with old Frank, just in the nick o' time, de ye see, and he is good an old soul as ever trod on neat's leather. So he says to me, Tom, you're the man (if any body can) that'ill just go and fetch'um in; they ha' done a deal o' harm—d—d glad-to find'um out; there is the swift sailor, and take as many boys as you please to man her. The fellow says he will take you to the spot—always set a rogue to catch a rogue. And so, to be sure, was just agoin to sail to the States, had every thing aboard, but so it was I loitered away the time, 'till this here news come, and the Governor said he would not be denied, as how he would depend on no one else, and that's the amount o' the story.” I turned to Horton and asked him “if he did not recollect me?” He hesitated some time, but at length stammered out that “he did—that he thought he had seen me before.” “You must be at no loss,” replied I, “to recollect me, when you were a servant at my father's; you must be the villain that stole Hunter's bonds out of my father's trunk, but I forgive you as you have been the means of saving my life.” “Ah, friend, I thought thee was as great a villain as any o' the gang, but thee shall get the papers and Hunter shall get 'um too.” “And how came it to pass,” said I, “that two such friends as you and Hunter should differ? A disclosure cannot injure you now, as it is a matter that concerns you and him alone; you can incur no sort of danger, by a full confession; besides, you will eventually be compelled to disclose every thing that relates to your connexion with this man, as a witness. He is a citizen of the United States, and must be taken there to stand his trial.” Horton scratched his head, and after some hesitation said, “that Hunter was one of the worst of men; that he had been his ruin.” “To the point—to the point,” said my uncle, “we have'nt time to listen to thee, ruination and all that sort o'thing—how come thee to fall out? answer that.” “May it please your honour, sir, I was to have one-fourth of all that Hunter made, and he never gave me any thing but ill usage. When I challenged him for his breach of promise, he said he would fit me out a vessel, and I should have the command of her. He failed in this, and I threatened to discover upon him if he did not comply with one or the other of his promises. He said I should have my deserts as soon as we were landed, adding he would put me where the dogs would not bite me. Expecting from this that he intended to murder me, I took the opportunity one night as we were close under Havana, (looking for game as we call it,) to slip into the water and swam to shore.” “That is the truth, I believe 'um,” said my uncle, “for I saw him as wet as a drowned rat.” “And is Hunter a partner of these pirates?” said I. “He is, sir,” said Horton. “You say he was to give you a fourth; a fourth of what?” “A fourth of what we gained.” “What by?” “Why sir, by robbery, if I must tell the truth. Hunter found these men in vessels, guns and every thing they wanted, and they gave him half the profits. When Hunter could not come here to attend to it himself, he would send me. Why he has been at this business ten years.” “Well go thy ways, I hates to hear it—'can't keep my temper at hearing such doings.” In a few minutes Sambo re-entered, having made great improvement in his appearance by the addition of a clean piece of checked cloth by way of apron, extending from chin to toe. He placed a white cloth on the rude table, knives and forks, plates, and some best cogniac, which would have been irresistible, had it sparkled in decanters, instead of a large rough wooden noggin. He next disposed several horn tumblers around the noggin, not forgetting his master's large silver cup. Thus having given the last evidence of his skill to the table, Sambo withdrew. In a quarter of an hour he returned with a huge coffee-pot in one hand, and a dish of nicely fried, fresh fish, in the other, followed by the old woman loaded with cups and bowls, out of which it was intended we should drink our coffee. “Ah, massa,” said Sambo, as he placed the things on the table, “dis caffee make you feel young. I make him myself and bootyful fish you neber see—dat dare man what catch him dis mornin; he did'en know who goin eat him.” “Why done you make hase?” said he to his companion in attendance, “you so slow about ebery ting.” She looked at him as if she could have killed a host with one glance of her eye, though she had but one in her head. He disappeared once more, still grumbling at the sloth of his companion, who nevertheless followed him to bring the rest of the supper. When they re-appeared, I was astonished to see an exquisite dish of oysters, and a delicious looking wild fowl, an untouched ham, and a great quantity of sea biscuit. “Well, d—n these rascals, see to 'em, how they lived—old hag didn't always fare thus!” “Fine cheer!” said my uncle as he advanced to the table in order to sit down. Our fille de chambre made him no answer. “D—n thee for a blear ey'd old b—h, canst speak, ey! come, boys, sit down—tell ye what—Sweet-heart, get thee out o' my sight—never stir if thee baint the ugliest old —! do'st hear? change thy garments before 'e comes back, and wash that face o' thine.” She still was silent, though she took my uncle's advice in withdrawing from his presence. She certainly ad the least refinement about her that I ever witnessed in one of the sex. As I before observed, she had but one eye: her nose, originally short, was rendered still more so by some accident. She was about five feet ten, in height, had she been straight—but that she was not. She was about sixty years of age, clad in an old green petticoat, bespotted with the grease of years. As for her face, I should suppose if water and it had ever been acquainted it was several years since.[6] [6] This is no fiction. The author lived in the neighborhood of a female, who was a native of the north of Ireland, and who was never known to wash her face or hands, so that the dirt had actually become a part of her. Every one remembers Rosy Dempry, Greenb***r County, Va. More anecdotes are related of her than would fill a moderate volume—one of which may give some idea of Rosy. The author passing by her house one day (which was in the country) in company with several gentlemen and ladies, we discovered Rosy sitting under a fence by the road side, eating mush and milk with a spoon. We stopped our horses and talked with her some time, and amongst other things one of the company asked her the cause of her eating out of doors.—“And troth, sir,” said she, “I can no' eat in the house for the fleas: they hop into my cup till my milk's fairly black wi”um.” Some of the now first families in West Virginia have the honour of claiming kin with Rosy. It was wrinkled something like the skin of an Irish potatoe, when it has undergone a thaw after being frozen. I observed to my uncle that probably his hand-maid did not understand English. 10 “He unstan well enough—he do ebery ting I tell him.” “Thee didn't bring a bit o' wine, didn't Sam?' “No sir, I wan' bring wine, massa say no—bring branny.” “Well I believe I did, but didn't think o' stayin' so long and brandy is better to make one light; but I hates it at table,” said the old man after taking a hearty draught. “Maybe got some wine here, I go see,” said Sambo. “Tell that old dare-the-d—l to come hither.” When she approached, he addressed her with “hark-'ee, comrade, hasn't some wine aboard?” By the time he had said this, she being full in his view, his disgust revived in a tenfold degree, and without waiting for a reply, he cried out “avast—do say thee's fit for nothing but to feed the crows—why her face looks as 'tware parboiled,” said he as Sambo followed her to enquire about the wine. It was some time before Sambo returned, bearing a demi-john, which proved about half full of excellent Madeira. “Maybe the old hag has poisoned it, Sambo—dos't think she has?” “No, sir, he love him too well he self; he had him hid away in agroun—I be boun he good.” “And it be clean, its more than she be,” said the old man, as Sambo filled his cup. “Ah, its excellent,” said he after tasting it, “take some boys,” after turning off a bumper himself. Sambo's eyes sparkled with joy to think he had put the finishing stroke to the supper, and we as well as the old gentleman did great honour to the things of the cavern after ordering the guard to be doubled. “Curse these pirates,” said my uncle, “I don't like to—'um—then—I believe they're—all-a-very—set---o' heathens,” as he chewed the crisped end of a fish. “But I should like to know how Dick will do to night, de ye see—left him to take care o' the vessel and like o' that.” As I knew nothing of the Dick he mentioned, I said nothing. This was the most pleasant repast I had partaken of since I left Tennessee three years before. After we had supped, the men who were not on duty were called to receive their rations of biscuit and brandy, which when they had disposed of, they were ordered on guard until the others should also partake of refreshment. “And now,” said my uncle, “be upon the watch boys, keep a good look out; I be going to lay me down to take my rest—if any thing stirs, fire the alarm-gun—dos't hear Ferguson?” “Ay, ay, sir,” said Ferguson. “I believe these are a sort o' slippery fellows we ha' got among.” He then called Sambo to fix him a place to sleep, and after repeating his orders to the men, Sambo helped him to lie down, taking a brimming cup in the first place. “D—n your limbs, take care,” said he to his servant as he found himself unable to walk steady. “No dangy, massa, you no fall.” “No fall! thee son o' a b—h dost think I be drunk?” “No, massa, I mean my step so awkard.” After the necessary attention to his master, Sambo seemed disposed to sieze the present opportunity to refresh himself with the remnant of the supper. Indeed, there was nothing left but the bones and some biscuit; he indemnified himself, however, from the noggin.— While he was picking all the meat that was left on the bones, I rallied him for his want of gallantry in not inviting old aunt Dorithy, or what may be her name, to come and partake with him, they being fellow-labourers together. “That's bravely thought on,” said my uncle, “go and tell her to come and eat, you dog.” “Blessy, massa, notting 'tall to eat—young massa jus makin he fun.” “Well go and tell her to come and drink then; I warrant she loves brandy.” Sambo knew when to obey, and stepping into the apartment, soon returned with the queen of the cavern. “Now sir, pour out for both of ye, and drink for better acquaintance.” I could not, I confess, preserve much decorum. Wilson and I laughed at the grotesque appearance of the old woman. It was the first time almost in two years that either he or myself had smiled. Sambo had very gallantly presented the old lady a bumper, and likewise filled one for himself. After bowing down till his head touched the table, waited with a mischievous smile on his countenance, for her to pledge him, but she refused in sullen silence, until my uncle exclaimed, “Why don't thee drink with thy new sweet-heart, thee old h—l cat?—Blast thee, 'would think't the first time ever thee refused—drink, I say.” She waited for no further invitation, but turned the best part of it off and was withdrawing, when Sambo called her to come and take her “cockly-wear.” After she retired, I asked Sambo how he would like the old lady for a wife? By this time he had become, as well as the rest of us, pretty lively; his eyes sparkled, and he was all glee. “Ah, massa,” said he, as with the bacon-bone in one hand and knife in the other, the labour of which he often relieved by the application of his teeth. “You is funin now, you rekon I have dat ole ting—he look wossa den allegator.” The sudden transition from death to life, disposed me to listen to the sprightly sallies of Sambo; but my uncle proposed that we should now go to rest. Wilson had a great-coat, but I had not seen mine since my arrival at the cavern. My uncle hearing me observe this, ordered Sambo to go and tell that old hag to get the coat instantly, or he'd put “her to death.” This message soon produced the great-coat, and we placed ourselves by the side of the old man. Although we had rested none the preceding night, yet neither Wilson nor myself seemed disposed to sleep. The incidents of the day repassing before me, seemed to be the work of magic. I thought of the generous Leanora; I thought of my orphan sister; a thousand ideas arose in my mind respecting her, and although the guard was strong, both within and without, yet the desperate situation of the prisoners suggested thoughts in my mind very far from those of perfect confidence. I spoke to my uncle in a low voice, intimating the danger we were in, should other pirates (which for ought we knew might be the case) make their appearance in the course of the night, and asked him “if he was perfectly assured of the fidelity of his men?” “Why blast thee, thee an't a coward, boy, art thee? just go to sleep, if 'come's we'll fix 'um—needn't fear, my boys be as true as steel.” I gave him to understand that I was little concerned on my own account; that it was his safety alone that interested me, and I thought little of watching by him till day. “Oh lay thee down my son, and take thy rest, no danger at all—The men will call me in case of surprise, and Sambo,” said he, “trim thy lamp—fellow does't hear?—keep up a light.” Then asking the interiour guard if their peices were well charged and primed, he betook himself to his wonted repose. The inside guard consisted of six men. Six others were lying snoring near the door which opened into that part of the cavern where the prisoners were confined; those last were to relieve the first at twelve o'clock. Fifteen were under arms on the outside of the cavern, which were to be relieved at the same hour by a like number, who were then locked fast in the arms of sleep. The faithful Sambo was traversing the cavern backwards and forward and trimming his lamp alternately, while his generous master was snoring by my side. The guard had told nine, starlight and all well. I found myself growing sleepy, but before I resigned myself to sweet oblivion, I wished to settle our mode of proceeding with Wilson, which for the first time since our acquaintance produced some painful feelings on both sides, and asked him whether he intended to proceed immediately to Tennessee, or go on with us to New-York? (where my uncle was bound.) “You could not expect me,” said he, “to be so near my parents without calling to see them. Consider what they have done for me; I should be the most ungrateful wretch on earth, were I to pass by without calling to see them. True I am as anxious to visit Boston as you can 10* possibly be, and shall proceed to that place immediately after paying my respects to my parents. You certainly mean to accompany me through Tennessee.” He spoke this with a degree of warmth which cut me to the heart. “Dear Henry,” said I, “you know I would go with you to the end of the world; but you know my situation: how it stands with my uncle. He will expect me to go with him, and how am I to refuse? You know the obligation we are both under to him.” He replied “that it was true, I owed as much to him as he did to his parents—but Burlington, do you not owe me something?” “Yes, Wilson—I owe more to you than any earthly being; but I merely hinted how difficult it will be, to obtain my uncle's consent—I had no thoughts of wounding your feelings. Wilson,” said I, “you have known me long, and you have known me well, you had no right to suspect me; you know that you are dearer to me than my own soul.” “No more,” said he, pressing me to his bosom.— “Charles”—he could say no more, the word choked him —I threw my arms round him, returning his embrace! We both sobbed! But the pleasure of that moment was worth—no!—it was invaluable—I would not have exchanged it for worlds. It was the perfection of happiness, or friendship rather, and such as vulgar souls never knew. After our feelings had subsided, I found that sleep had vanished, and proposed to get up and take a (glass we had none) cup of wine, and smoke a segar, to which he assented. Taking a hearty draught of wine, and lighting the segars furnished us by Sambo, we seated ourselves one on each side of the table, having the lamp between us. I looked at Wilson—I thought he never looked so amiable. “Oh Charles,” said he with a smile, “have you forgiven me?” “Have I forgiven myself? you ought to have said.” The rest was silence—it was the eloquence of the heart—it was rapture. Those who have tasted the sweets of friendship will understand what we felt, as we sat and gazed at each other. Oh friendship! thou sweetener of our woes—thou first-born of heaven—what is to be put in competition with thee? After finishing our segars we lay down, and returning thanks to our divine preserver, fell asleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. Next morning about day-light I was awakened by Wilson, who was already up and dressed. My uncle, who likewise had been up some time, had issued orders and the men were preparing the prisoners for marching. This was done by tying two and two, together, with ropes which were found in the cavern intended no doubt, for a very different purpose. The booty was placed on the mules, which were found rambling near the cave. While every thing was hurry and activity amongst them, arranging matters to be off as quick as possible, I was no little amused with the squabbles which took place between my uncle, his man Sambo, and the old Czarina. He had associated them together to bring out the contents of the cavern and the men placed it on the backs of the mules, when brought forth. But Sambo and his mate discharged their duty in a manner that was by no means amicable. She was by far too slow, and testified very clearly that she was unwilling to put forth all her strength. My uncle stormed, Sambo gabbled, and the old woman growled. After be-thee-ing and be-thou-ing them till he was hoarse, he mounted his mule (which I held by the bridle) and rode forward to take the command of the prisoners in person, telling Wilson and myself to take charge of the baggage, and ordering Sambo to follow him. Finding he gave no orders respecting the old woman, I asked him “if she had not better go with Sambo?” “Go with h—l,” said my uncle, giving his mule the spur, “let the witch of Endor go with the baggage.” As the care of her had devolved on me, I followed her into the cave with a view to hasten her departure. Upon entering it, I perceived her wrapping a cloth round something, which she endeavoured to conceal. “What is that you have there, old lady?” said I, “let me see: perhaps it is something belonging to our people.” “I don' know,” said she in broken English, and very reluctantly handed to me an old-fashioned pocket book. Upon looking on the outside, I discovered “W. Hunter,” in large gilt letters. A thought struck me that it might contain something relative to my unhappy parents, but not having time to examine it then, I told her that it belonged to one of the prisoners, and that I would take care of it myself—desired her to set out forthwith. Coming out of the cave, I gave the word to march, Wilson, myself, and old Tanfaronado bringing up the rear. My uncle and the prisoners by this time were nearly out of sight. It became necessary therefore for us to move forward briskly or be left behind. The distance to the sea-shore was supposed to be about two miles, and the track (no road being in the case) the most difficult that could be conceived, passing over barren fragments of rocks, which rendered it almost impossable for any thing but a mule to travel it. Although Wilson and I were well armed with each a brace of pistols and musket, and every man of our party likewise carrying a loaded musket, yet I was not altogether free from apprehension of danger, had we been attacked in this narrow defile, even by an inferior force of those desperadoes. I could not, however, forbear laughing at our heroine, who walked (or hobbled rather) Indian-file between Wilson and me. She had improved her appearance considerably from what it was the preceding evening. She had not indeed pulled off the old green, but she had thrown over it a very fresh looking brown bombazette. On her feet she had a huge pair of leather shoes which made a noise, as they came in contact with the stones, something like that produced by the pestles of a powder mill. A checkered handkerchief was tied on her head, and over this an old fur hat, which had once been black, but was now a dirty red. Her face I would suppose she had attempted to wash, as it was now a kind of dapple-grey, whereas, the previous evening it was rather bordering on a black tan. I proposed to Wilson that “as he used to be a gallant among the ladies, he ought to assist her over the rough places, as she would never be able to keep up with the mules.” He turned round, after laughing his very soul out, and replied, “That he would be sorry to deprive me of that pleasure.” Finding that he declined the pleasure, as he termed it, I took hold of old Fille-de-sham's hand, to assist her; she turned her one eye upon me, and regarded me with something like a dubious look, but whether her sensations were those of pleasure or dislike, I could not discover. Notwithstanding my assistance and her own exertions, we began to fall considerable behind. I asked her “if she could ride?” she replied by shaking her head, intimating that she could not. “You must try it,” said I, and calling to the men to halt, I directed them to “bring one of the mules, that was least incumbered with baggage, and put the old lady on.” She shook her head in disapprobation, but I ordered them to “hoist her on,” telling them to “tie her to the pack, if she could not stick on without.” Accordingly one of them lifted her on the mule, which she bestrode, (I suspect) in imitation of my uncle. As she was probably ignorant of the mode practised by our modern belles in the art of riding, we told her that all she had to do now, was to hold fast. It was laughable enough to see her bend forward to catch hold of the baggage, while the mule trotted forward to overtake its companions. A little time brought us in view of the ship. The prisoners were already under escort in the long-boat— They having been disposed of, the boat returned, and in a few minutes every thing was on board. The pirates' vessel being lighter than ours, we took her in tow, hoisted sail, and stood for Havanna, keeping a south west course. The wind being unfavourable, we did not arrive there until the evening of the fifth day, though it was, as we supposed, but two days sail. In the course of the day I related to my uncle, in detail, the misfortunes ef my family, and likewise my long imprisonment in Mexico. “Poor boy,” said he, “thou hast had a boisterous voyage, indeed; but thou hast found a better haven than my Eliza and my little Thomas—poor things!—they— found—a watery grave—” said he, sobbing, with his handkerchief held to his face. This sudden effusion affected me deeply, and it was sometime before I could reply. The old man wept like a child, and the tender-hearted Wilson melted into tears. We were, all three, sitting by ourselves in the cabin.—After the old man's feelings had subsided, I enquired how it happened that his wife and child were drowned—he told me thus: “In consequence of his frequent voyages to the East and West Indies, he had acquired considerable property; and being present at a sale of some valuable property in St. Domingo, he purchased it very low.—Being tired of the sea he resolved to settle himself for life. He accordingly married the daughter of an English gentleman, to whom he had been long attached. “Her parents, who lived in the Island, approving the match, was the cause that led him to settle in that Island. They were wealthy, and she was their only child. He cultivated his plantation with great success, and was fast increasing in wealth. “At the end of two years his wife blessed him with a beautiful boy. This was a circumstance of great joy, not only to him, but to her parents—But alas! how vain are earthly joys! When his dear babe was a year old, he fitted out a vessel to go to Liverpool, freighted principally with the joint productions of his own plantation, and that of his father-in-law's. “Both families wanted several articles of necessity, amongst which was a large assortment of furniture. It was therefore settled between them that my uncle should go and dispose of the cargo and lay in the articles.” “I left my Eliza, and her little son at her father's, and set sail for England—and that was the last—” His emotion overcame him, again. To divert his mind I called Sambo to prepare coffee and tea, as it drew near supper-time, and bid him bring a bottle of his best —as I wanted something to raise my spirits. “Here, take the keys, and bring it out of the red case,” said my uncle. “Ah, massa, you mean de green case, I know!” “Well, go—thou knowest better than I; get every thing that Charles wants.” Happening at this moment to make some remark to Sambo, about the old woman, which my uncle over-hearing, desired him to call her before him. When she appeared, my uncle interrogated her about her birth, parentage, marriage, and not forgeting, the loss of her eye. After a good deal of questioning we understood that she was a native of Barbadoes, and had lost her eye in resisting her husband, in a scuffle. My uncle, after making his usual caustic remarks, turned to me— “Charles, get the old hag a passage to Barbadoes, first thing thee does, and put her aboard after night; say that she goes to see her friends.—No one will be asking about such a sooty craft as she be.” Supper being now ready, and fearing my uncle would enter upon the melancholy subject of his wife and child, I observed, as we sat down to it, “that we ought to have Horton up next.” “Yes,” said my uncle, “and Hunter too; he shall make restitution to thee before I'm done with him. Sambo, go and tell Ferguson to come hither.” When Ferguson appeared, “Well, (said my uncle) hast thou got them fellows well secured?” “I have, sir.” “Hast been at supper?” “I have not, sir.” “Take some brandy, and sit thee down. Sambo, attend here.—Friend thee must take a guard and bring up Hunter, and tell Horton to come. I believe he's not a whit better; but then, as for that we will say nothing— He has been the means of saving— “Why, boy, thee don't drink—thee made such a fuss about raisin' thy spirits, Charles. I understand thee, thou'lt think to get me fuddled again—come on, hand the bottle to these youngsters Oh, yes, there's a chip o' the old block—thou needn't be winking at each other.— Faith! thou shalt each drink his glass: no cheating above board.” After swallowing the whole of my glass, I begged off, observing, “that after disposing of Hunter, I would obey him in all lawful commands.” “Yes, but thou art a cunning dog after all, to qualify thy obedience with a salvo—but Dick Jinkins shall be here to see fair play; and thou come too, Ferguson, thou must come and sing. Dick is a fine fellow—and as for this Mr. Sly Boots, (looking at Wilson) that plagued the old woman about her nose,[7] [7] Wilson, it seems, asked the old woman if the same man that knocked out her eye, bit off her nose! I warrant he's got more in his head than a body thinks, though he looks as if butter wouldn't melt in his month” Supper being ended, Ferguson hastened to execute his orders. “Take these things away, Sambo, (said my uncle,) and lay my sword and pistols on the table. Although it could not be improper to make this display, yet I determined to suffer no bloodshed. The rattling of chains announced the approach of Hunter. Horton, who went at large, entered first. Hunter followed, looking rueful enough. “Take off his fetters. Horton, where art thou, stand forth. Well, Hunter, what do'st think ought to be done to thee? Go off to the guard, none need stay but Ferguson. Speak villain, what do'st deserve?” “Oh, bless you sir, don't ask me any questions. I am a wretched man! Take my life, take all I have, but ask me nothing.” Hunter, no doubt, was aware that this was the surest plan he could have fallen upon to soften my uncle. Had he not humbled himself as he did, he would very probably have received some rough usage, if not from my uncle, he would from me. How differently do we act, when it comes to the test, from what we resolve. The wretched appearance of this man, and the humble style in which he addressed my uncle, effectually disarmed his noble soul. “Take my life—take all I have!” Nothing more was in his power to grant; no other retribution could we ask. Had I met Hunter in any other situation, a sense 11 of my wrongs, a sense of the injuries he had done my family, might have urged me to some act of desperation; but when I beheld the wretch penitent, and completely in my power, I had no other feelings than those of pity.— My uncle, however, grew warm as the conversation between him and Hunter advanced. “Take thy life! forsooth, it's not worth taking! Would such a life as thine signify aught, d'ye see, for the robberies and murders thou hast committed? Look at this young man, (pointing to me) do'st thou know him?” Hunter lifted his eyes slowly upon me, (they had hitherto rested on the floor) and said, “I think it is young Burlington.” “Wouldst thy life, or ten thousand such worthless lives as thine, and ten thousand times all that thou hast robbed from honest men, indemnify him for the murder of his parents? Take all that thou hast! thou hast nothing but what thou hast stolen and robbed from others— Thou murdered this young man's father and mother; thou murdered my brother, and thou wert within an ace o' murdering his son:—Thou monster of blood, thou art not fit to die, nor fit to live! Where's the bonds that thou suborned Horton, here, to steal from my brother?” Hunter raised his eyes, for the second time, from the floor, to look at Horton, wishing as I thought, to adapt his answer agreeably to what he might discover in Horton's countenance. “Answer me, villian: or by heavens—” laying his hand on his pistol as he spoke. “I destroyed them,” said Hunter. “Arn't thee the blackest villain upon earth?—Thou hast done nothing but rob, steal, and murder, since thou wert born. Thou ought to have been hung at ten years old: there's no calculating thy wickedness—Thou'st betrayed thy trust to Mrs. Blarney Hasset, or whatever may be her name. “Like a thief thee stole the woman's goods that she trusted thee with. If thy soul had not been as black as h—ll, thee would have refunded the money to her for which thee sold them.[8] [8] This part of his story we had learned from Horton. Charles, look in my Escritoir and bring me from thence the pen and ink and some paper. Now sir, sit down and make an inventory of all thou hast; and by heaven, if thee prevaricates one jot or tittle, thee may guess the consequence. Give him a glass o' brandy, poor d—l! I hates the very sight of him.” Hunter looked, as may be imagined, just like one who is going to be hung. He turned off the brandy, however, and took the pen in his hand, without asking any questions, and began to make out a schedule of his property. I waited on my uncle with a decanter of good old London particular, begging him to resume his good humour, and reminding him of his promise to have Dick Jinkins up to sing. “Oh, you rogues, you just think to trip me up, d—l a drop will I drink till thee, and what's his name, there, pledge—” Hunter interrupted by observing that his hand was so much injured by the fetters that he could not write. “Charles, my son, sit down and make it out exactly as he tells thee.” While Hunter and I were engaged at the inventory, Wilson undertook to keep my uncle in chat.—Indeed it was the first opportunity they had had of conversing together since their acquaintance, being constantly engaged. “Hal, (said he to Wilson) I can never think o' thy 'tother name, give that poor d—l another glass of wine, (meaning Hunter)—Ferguson, help thyself, and let Horton join thee—Come boys, we are not long to be together—a few days more.” By the time I had completed the schedule my uncle began to be pretty good humoured—I mean what the sailors call half-seas-over. I handed him the inventory, which (with spectacles on) he mumbled over, partly to himself. “Two—hou—es lots—in New-York—House—in Boston—Stock—Goods—forth—Humph, thou writest s-such a hand—Who, think ye, can read it?” “I will read it over for you,” said I, and taking the paper, I ran it over. When I had done he asked me if that would be enough to pay what Hunter owed me. “Undoubtedly sir, it will, if he owns what he herein states to be his.” “Well, count the interest boy, thee understands figures I suppose; thy father was the best boy in school at figures; for my own part I never learnt further than the rule o' three. How much was the bonds?” “As well as I recollect sir, they were four thousand pounds.” “What sayest Hunter, is that right?” “I believe it is, sir.” “No believes about it, speak positively, sir.—What was the amount? “Charles, thee knows boy how long it is; thee can count the interest at thy leisure. Do'st think it will make thee whole?” “I think it will sir, if, as I observed to you before, he has given in a true inventory.” “By the G—d of Abraham, if he has equivocated a single iotim I'll make his head twirl on the floor like a top. Do'st see this sword friend, look at it, thinkest could take off thy head at one stroke?” Hunter made no reply to the last question, but observed— “That if the property in the inventory was not sufficient to pay the debt, he (my uncle) had enough in his hands to make up the deficiency.” I was sorry to hear this, knowing that he could mean no other than the treasure found in the cave, and that my uncle, as he had stated to me, determined to deliver over to the Governor of Havanna. Fearing the effect this observation would have upon him, whose high sense of honour would not brook the indignity of the insinuation, I intended to reply to Hunter myself, thinking to obviate the consequence. But before Hunter finished the sentence, my uncle, who was deliberately taking a pinch of snuff, with eyes nearly closed, no sooner heard the drift of Hunter's reply, than his eyes flew open to double their ordinary magnitude. “What's that, friend? I have enough in my hands! What have I in my hands, pray? what does the fellow mean?” “If you mean the money found on the pirates, (said I, taking up the subject) my uncle has no claims, whatever, on that, it belongs to those for whom he undertook the expedition—It belougs to the Governor of Havanna.” “And do'st think, thou piratical scoundrel, that I'd touch the spoil of blood? If 'twas in my power, I should expect the ghosts of those thou hast murdered would devour me—would expect that God Almighty would send his thunderbolts against me. It would canker in my pockets, it would; but what signifies talkin' to the d—l incarnate? Take him out of my sight,” said my uncle, exhausted with rage. It would have fared much worse with Hunter had the old gentleman known the extent of his villainy towards my father. It was not in his purloining the bonds only, that Hunter acted the villain; this, perhaps, my father would hardly have felt. It was his secreting his own property, and thereby bringing a host of creditors upon the firm, by which my father's property was sacrificed to pay his debts. Had my uncle have known this, and also that he had raised Hunter from the most abject poverty, and advanced goods and money to the amount of four thousand pounds, for which those bonds above mentioned, were executed; and four thousand pounds at that time were equal to eight thousand, and perhaps more, at this time, I am inclined to think the old man would not have awaited the invalidity of the inventory, to hazard the strength of the sword. I was much relieved by the departure of Hunter, being grieved to see my uncle disturbed on my account.— The good old man ordered his servant to take him a bed, —a bottle of wine, together with coffee and sugar. “Friend, (said he to Ferguson) see that Hunter wants nothing, d'ye hear, and don't iron him. When thee returns, bring Dick with thee; he's one of your topping fellows: he and I have seen hard times together.” I took the opportunity of our being alone, to acquaint 11* my uncle of the relation in which Wilson stood in our family, giving him to understand that an union between him and my sister was intended. This confidence he well merited, independently of any other other consideration; but my motive in making this disclosure at this time, was designed as a prelude to secure his consent to a request I intended to make, for leave to accompany Wilson through Tennessee. As soon therefore, as Ferguson withdrew, I took Wilson by the hand, and led him to my uncle— “Sir, (said I) you behold in this young man another nephew.” “How—don't understand?” “He has been engaged to your niece a number of years, and is now on his way to consummate the nuptials.” The old man eyed him sometime in silence, surveying from head to foot, as if he had seen him for the first time, at length seizing Wilson's hand, in a transport he exclaimed, “Why, him—him—Boy—Why didn't—thee t-tell— me before?—Ah, thou'rt a sly rogue! I've a great mind thou shan't have my niece, just to plague thee.” I alleged in excuse our perpetual engagements since we met, and this was the first opportunity we had had. The cabin door opened, and Ferguson and Dick Jinkins entered, followed by Sambo. “Ah, old fellow, glad thou art come—just thinking o' old times; take some o' the kill-grief, and pray thee give us old lang-syne. Sambo get thy violin and strike in with the chorus.” and pulling Wilson down on the seat, which I had purposely placed by him, he observed, “thou shall sing too, never stir if thou shan't all sing. Charles thee see there's plenty to drink—stop, (said he) we ought to give them poor fellows something, it'll go hard enough with them; they are christian people, d'ye see, like ourselves. Charles, order the dogs a gill of rum apiece.” Though I approved this mark of hospitality in my uncle, yet I by no means coincided in opinion with him, that they were christians. Ferguson and myself set out to execute this order, and upon our return were obligedto join the music party, which had already advanced to the second stanza of old-lang-syne. Sambo, who touched the bow with much skill, turned his melting eyes upon me, as if to challenge my approbation. Jinkins really sung with a great deal of taste; he appeared to be my uncle's right hand man, and one of your noble looking men, he was about five feet nine, dressed in a short green broadcloth coat, with narrow lace, and under it a rich Brussel's vest. His hair and sparkling eyes were black; his manners easy and graceful; he was about twenty-three years of age; his features regular; his complexion, originally fair, was sun-burnt; his countenance very pleasing, and the very index of humour. To old lang-syne succeeded “Mary I believe thee true,” and “Larry O Brien,” &amp;c. &amp;c. After we were tired of singing Dick Jinkins produced his flute, and accompanied by Sambo, gave us Robin Jones, Jolly Tar, Nancy Dawson, and a variety of airs, which were favourites of my uncle, until the old man, who had been nodding sometime, thought it was bed time, and saying “we might sit up and amuse ourselves as long as we chose,” called Sambo to help him into his hammock. After chatting awhile with Jinkins, whom I found intelligent and and amusing, we also betook ourselves to our hammocks. We invited Jinkins to sleep with us; but he declined, observing “that his presence was indispensable elsewhere,” intimating the confidence reposed in him by his patron—He and Ferguson therefore bid us good night, and we went to bed very nearly whole-seas-over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. The next morning we all arose well, except Wilson, who had a violent head-ache, which subjected him to the raillery of the old gentleman, who declared he would never do if he could not set out an old fellow like him. “I doubt Mary will have a poor stick of thee, child, (going to him and feeling of his pulse.) Oh, thou needn't let blood, thou artn't so bad, man; why Sambo, how many bottles did we set?” “Only five, sir.” “Humph, that's a pretty thing to lay up a young lark, just going to be married, too—Go and tell the cook to make him some chicken broth, and he will soon be well enough.” I followed Sambo, and while waiting for some water to mix the medicine for Wilson, he enquired how his master come to talk about his mistress and her child. I replied that I had enquired about them, but that he began it himself. “Oh, massa, you shouldn't neber say a word about um, if you do, massa go crazy.” “How were they drowned?” said I to Sambo. “Oh, massa, he go away to Englan'—I 'long to ole massa, he wife fadda. Dis here massa he stay so long de nigger rise—kill ebery body, burn house—Ole massa he lib close to de sea, he talk hout takin ship—Before dat, by blood! one night here cum great many niggers: ole misse she tell me, Sambo run tell youn' misse—youn' misse she run to one house, tay all night—I run all my might—knock at de doa to tell um da all will be kill'd— call youn' misse, yerk de chile out out he arms, tell him run arter me so hard he can.” In short, that most of the inhabitants were massacred by the negroes, their houses burned, and that his master's wife and child, by his assistance, escaped on board of a vessel; but what vessel he (Sambo) could not tell.— He went on to relate that he remained on the Island with a view of preventing his master from landing, when he should arrive, pretending he was on the side of the negroes—that his master arrived in a few days, and he succeeded in getting on board, and acquainted him with the slaughter of the inhabitants, in which his wife's parents fell victims: also the fate of his mistress and her child.—That his master hoisted sail, with him on board, and visited England and France, and almost every part of Europe; but never heard more of his wife or child; concluding that they were cast away or murdered by the negroes, he gave over the search in despair, and settled in Havanna; but was often seized with fits of grief that threatened his life.” “And did you stay with your master ever since?” “I stay wid she sir.” “You are a faithful fellow, (said I) and well entitled to his regard, I hope he will reward thy fidelity.” “Who massa? Ah, massa lub me he do his life—me and Dick Jinkin, we dare too.” When we returned to the cabin I found Wilson laughing very heartily at something my uncle had said to him. “Oh, he's well enough—ye needn't be giving him that stuff.” “He must take it, (said I) it will cool his fever.” “Well, thee landsmen knows best what will cure ye— Come Sambo, let's have breakfast, I think the wind has shifted. Did thee hear the course?” “S. S. E. I think, sir.” “I hates this tacking business.” After breakfast Sambo produced a back-gammon table; after directing him to go and see to Wilson's broth, I sat down to play with the old man; but he beat me every game. After Wilson drank his broth I told him to come and try the old colt, for he was too hard for me.— Wilson proving an overmatch for him, “Ah, (said the old gentleman) Dick can beat us all— I'll have him up.” Thus we passed three more days, which brought us to Havanna. We contrived to amuse the old man during the time, so as to leave him no opportunity of resuming the melancholy narrative of his misfortunes. When we cast anchor my uncle, accompanied by Wilson and myself, waited upon the Governor, who expressed great satisfaction at the success of the expedition, and invited us to dinner. After dinner Wilson, and I and the deputy Governor, were directed to see the prisoners and effects landed. The specie we weighed, not having time to count it. In gold and silver there were eight hundred and seventy-eight thousand pounds sterling, besides a great quantity of unwrought gold and silver in ingots. All this together with the mules, the prisoners and vessel of the pirates were delivered to the deputy; only Hunter and the old woman were retained. Hunter being a citizen of the United States, my uncle claimed the disposal of him. Having delivered a written statement of the prizes we had made, the governor offered to several of my uncle's followers liberal presents as some compensation for the hard service in which they had been engaged. But my uncle would listen to no offer of the kind. Hunter he retained, and for the old woman he procured a passport and sent her to Barbadoes, with something in her pockets. According to the directions of my uncle, I provided a passage for her to that island, and going down to the vessel I saw her safe aboard for the place of her destination. When we returned, I found the two old cronies in a pretty high gale. “Ha!” said he to Wilson, “we are going to have another spree to-night—do'st think thou can stand the old colt another bout?—We're going to have all the music in town—where's Jinkins?” I said he would attend him directly. “Oh, God bless you, my dear sir,” said Wilson, “do excuse me to-night; I am not well; I'll set up and sing for you to-morrow night.” “Thou an't well! ah, I knew thou would'st back out —thou can'st not stand service with a tried old sailor.” Getting up and going to Wilson, (who I verily believe was dissembling) he sat down by him, and taking his hand, addressed him in the most affectionate terms. “Thou an't sick, child, art thee?” Wilson could not bring himself to impose upon so much goodness; he smiled as my uncle was, with a serious look, endeavouring to ascertain the truth from his countenance. “Ah, thou art a grand rogue; no more sick than I be—we'll all be as merry as grigs—oho, thou shalt sing old lang syne.” By this time Jinkins made his appearance. “Oh, there's my boy—come and take a full bottle— this is our house to night—we be the masters—but prithee, Jinkins, be Hunter safe?” “He is, sir.” “I think as we be going to ha' music to-night, and d'ye see, can't do without thee, better put him aboard our own ship, release the fellows and put a guard over him.” The company now began to gather. I was glad to hear that no ladies were to be present, nothing but a parcel of good hearty souls, as my uncle called them— my poor head you'll go to pot to-night, thought I, but I comforted myself in thinking it would be the last time I should be put to such an alternative. Indeed, I felt more for Wilson than myself, as he was less able to stand it. I approached him and in a low voice encouraged his fatigued spirits by telling him how unmanly it would appear to shrink from a participation in this general joy; that the party was given solely in honour of us; that it would be cruel not to gratify my uncle with hir presence, and that after he had sung a few songs I would watch an opportunity of getting him off upon honourable terms. He said “I would find it very difficult to deceive the old hero of the isles.” We were now through politeness, obliged to attend to the music. There were half a dozen of violins, as many flutes, flageolets, &amp;c. without number, and two bass viols. The music was insupportably bad, Sambo and Jinkins being by far the best performers. Wilson always sings well, and I perform indifferently on the flute, but we were borne away with the discordant scraping of the other performers. In the course of an hour we were called to partake of a splendid supper, at which no female appeared. After supper we returned to the heterogeneous collection of noises—with the exception of a few tunes they were all new to me; but my uncle who understood them, I suspect, was delighted. He also could speak a little French, while Wilson and I endeavoured to be good company in bad Spanish. I enjoyed myself much worse than I expected, Wilson was mad, and my uncle transported. At length on a sudden he became much affected. Drawing a chair with me I sat down by him, and throwing my arm carelessly on the back of his chair, I pressed his hand and asked him if he was ill. He shook his head and suppressing his feelings, “that,” said he, “was my dear Eliza's favourite tune: but I never finished her story.” “Oh, sir,” said I, “don't enter upon that subject to-night, I had the whole story from Sambo—make yourself happy. True your loss can never be repaired, but as far as it is in my power I shall make it the chief pleasure of my life to smooth the evening of your age; I will live with you, and endeavour to fulfil the duties of a son.” Wilson now approached us, sat down on the other side of him, and kindly enquired after his health. Fearing to disturb the company, I left them together and taking up my flute, the music ceased, and I struck up Yankee Doodle. To this succeeded a number of our tunes and by degrees the music gave way to loud talking and laughter, which continued till twelve o'clock. Going to my uncle I told him that it was quite time for him to retire, that he would injure his health by such late hours. The old man made no reply, but giving his hand suffered me to lead him to his room, where Sambo performed the rest. I returned to the company who were nearly blind, and taking Wilson's arm retired without more ceremony. Next morning I waited upon my uncle before he was out of bed, and found him far from well. I informed him that Wilson and I must have some clothes made as quick as possible, that we were almost destitute of any, and waited on him for directions where to apply for the materials and some one to make them. “To besure, my son,” said he—“prithee, Sambo, get my clothes—heigh-ho, I drank too much o' old Frank's wine last night—wan't it excellent?—tell me. How be Hal? I got a plaguey head-ache.” I informed him of Wilson's health. “He's a noble fellow, but can't stand service.” By this time he was dressed, and ordering Sambo to tell the steward to attend him, we walked out in search of Wilson. After finding Wilson, my uncle took the necessary steps for procuring suits of clothes for us both. This he accomplished in his usual generous manner, and every suggestion which our delicacy made, was promptly obviated by this liberal hearted son of the ocean. As the time was drawing nigh when we must leave Havana, I resolved to break the subject of accompanying Wilson through Tennessee, to my uncle at once. After breakfast I called Wilson aside and informed him of my intention, telling him at the same time to go to the office of entry and engage our passage to New-Orleans at a venture. Wilson set out to procure a passage, and I with a heavy heart sought my uncle. Meeting with him in the parlour I proposed a walk, to which he cheerfully consented, and locking my arm in his we proceeded some distance before I could bring myself to name the matter to him—I essayed to speak, but the word stuck in my throat—my uncle in the meantime had commenced a desultory conversation on other matters quite foreign to the point. At length summoning my resolution and putting on a serious look, I addressed him in a faultering voice. “I have a disclosure to make to you, sir, that must distress you, as it certainly does myself.” He was silent—and I proceeded: “It is needless to repeat to you, sir, what I have said already, that the life you have saved, shall be devoted to you, and most assuredly it shall, and though the request I have to make cannot lessen me in your esteem, yet I fear it will give you pain.” “Oh for God's sake to the point—to the point—what dos't want?” 12 “You know, sir, that Wilson is engaged to my sister; that he is on his way to wed her if she be alive; you know that his parents live in Tennessee, and he cannot think of proceeding on to Boston without calling to see them after three years' absence. It would be”— “Can'st thou not tell me what thou would have at once?” “Briefly then my dear sir, he wants me to go with him.” “And be that all?—I thought that thou hadst murdered somebody, thou began with such gravity. Why as for Wilson he ought to go and see his parents; but what dos't want with thee?—can't he go by himself?” “Sir, if you say so, it shall be so; I will not go without your consent, nor with it, if it grieves you to part with me. True I love Wilson, I am bound to him by a thousand obligations; we have lived together our life time I may say like brothers. He has saved my life at the hazard of his own. For my sake he concealed himself during four long months in the Spanish dominions, spending most of this time in the woods, and in caves, in want of every thing, hourly and momently exposed to the danger of loosing his life, instead of going to visit his parents, who had at a great expense procured his ransom from the Spanish dungeon. You are witness yourself, of his narrow escape from death since that event. It is for his sake, therefore, that I make this request. The road is long, lonesome and dangerous.” “We'll say no more about it, child; thee can go— thee can go—I should ha' been glad for both o'thee to go with me, but as it is 'suppose can't go—'twould be a pity to part ye, and he's a noble youth too. But my son don't forget to take a little o'thy uncle to bear thy expenses; I know thou can't ha' much; thy uncle has plenty, and 'twill all be thine and his together.” “Sir,” said I, pressing his hand, “I never”—it was some time before I had power to add—“expected such goodness as this—that you were generous I knew, but this sacrifice was more than I expected—may heaven reward thee, thou best of men.” Our feelings being mutually agitated we spake no more, but returned in silence. On entering the house, I asked him “when he would set sail?” “To-morrow,” said he faintly. “Dear uncle,” said I, “keep up your spirits; we will reach New-York probably before yourself. You must be aware how anxious I am to know what has become of my poor sister, and Wilson is almost heart-broken on her account. I trust we will all meet and be happy.” “Poor Mary,” said he sighing deeply, “thou wast a little prattling thing when I saw thee—but may be thee wasn't born—I forget almost about her. But thou did'st wrong in leaving the poor thing so long.” “Oh sir, you are not more sensible of this than I am; it is an error I shall deplore to my latest hour; but who could see these events, or who ever did act up to perfection? This pleasure (kissing the dear old man's hand) repays all my sufferings.” He was greatly agitated—after pressing my hand in his with a fervour that bespoke every thing, we entered the house. Wilson entered in the course of an hour; he knew by my countenance that I had succeeded, and we were once more happy. In the evening when wine and good cheer had restored our spirits, my uncle calling Hal to him— “Ah,” said he, “thou balked me at last—'thought to a'had thy company, but thou art a good child to go and see thy parents—Charles—Charles—he blubbered 'cause I would not let him go; O, he's as cheery since as a lark; look to him yonder, how bright his eyes shine, 'spose he's told thee?” “He has, sir,” said Wilson. I drew near them and Wilson continued— “Your consent has made us both happy, and I trust we shall soon meet again; I shall just call and stay one night with my parents and proceed on to”—He could say no more. “Well take care o' my poor boy, and see that thou runs no more fool's errands.” “Oh bless you, sir, we need no caution on that head I hope; sad experience has taught us a lesson that I dare say will last us to the end of our lives.” Next morning we waited on my uncle (who was ready to embark) for the purpose of taking leave of him on our embarkation for New Orleans. The Governor had taken care to convey on board our vessel, several articles of sea stores as a mark of his regard for us; and my uncle being determined to be generous himself in spite of our delicacy, insisted that we should accept several presents in money, which he had prepared for us. He would listen to no denial. The boat had now arrived that was to convey us to our ship, and now came another trial. After a few minutes silence, during which we all gave way to our feelings: “Dearest of men,” said I embracing my uncle, “we wait for your blessing.” “God bless you, my child,” said he, sobbing aloud as he pressed me to his bosom. Wilson followed my example. He walked with us a few paces, observing that “if it wasn't for shame, he would go with us, but that his freight was valuable, and the coast dangerous—and I hates to let the boys go by themselves.” We squeezed his hand once more and stepped into the boat. After gaining our own vessel the same boat conveyed him to his, and whilst the hands were unmooring our ships, we stood on our respective decks enjoying the sight of each other as long as possible. The wind, however, being in favour of my uncle, he was soon borne from our view—the last I saw, was the old man waiving his hat, which being returned by us, we hastened to the cabin to assuage those melancholy feelings which a parting of this kind generally creates.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. Our voyage to New-Orleans was tedious; although we took a smaller vessel when we gained the mouth of the Mississippi, it was twenty days in all before we reached New-Orleans. Here we procured horses, saddles, and saddle-bags, and set out without delay for Tennessee. Our horses were good and we spared them not. Nothing worthy of remark happened during our journey, which we accomplished in nineteen days. It was just dusk when we arrived before the gate of Captain Wilson. For the sake of the jest, and actuated by curiosity we concluded to pass for strangers, being almost sure that none of the family would recognize our persons. Accordingly we hailed the house, a servant came and opened the gate, we rode into the yard and dismounted. The old gentleman who was standing at the door to receive us, called to the servant and directed him “to bring the gentlemen's saddle-bags in the house,” politely invited us to walk in. We apologized for intruding, saying we were benighted, and begged for leave to spend the night with him. “Certainly, certainly, gentlemen—I am proud of your company, glad you called.” He then invited us to refresh ourselves with a little spirits and water, without the least recognition of our persons. “My dear,” said he to his wife, “have supper got for the gentlemen.”[9] [9] This is the case universally in the western states, to their honour be it recorded, both with gentle and simple. A stranger is hospitably entertained by all descriptions of people, and the traveller never hesitates to call for a night's lodging at any private house. The old lady arose accordingly, and went out to give the necessary orders. When she left us, the Captain commenced the common topics, such as the weather, roads, &amp;c. Meantime a negro girl of about twelve years of age, seemed to eye Wilson very attentively; it struck me at the time that she had some knowledge of her young master. After staring at him some time, she 12* withdrew, and in a few minutes Mrs. Wilson came in, and looking in her son's face very earnestly, exclaimed, “My son—my son—it is my Henry!” and rushed into his arms. The Captain was thunderstruck, and sat as though he was nailed to his seat. At length he got up and shook us cordially by the hand, reproving us for playing the cheat—but any how I am glad to see you—glad to see you—couldn't tell what had become of you. “Here,” said he to a servant, “take the keys—set the cellar door open—tell every body to come and rejoice.” He ran to and fro like one distracted—the servants, field negroes and all poured into the house, which rang with acclamations of joy. “Massa Henry's come— massa Henry's come.” The little girl “I know'd him fus, I know'd him fa' all he look so sly out o' he eyes.” After the tumult subsided, Mrs. Wilson related the circumstance which led to the discovery. She said the little girl already mentioned, came to her in the kitchen and said. “Mistress, dat dare man what got on de whitish coloured surtout look mighty like massa Henry.” “He does?” said Mrs. Wilson. “Yes, madam, he do so, and I do tink it is him, if didn't look so old.” Mrs. Wilson soon had a sumptuous supper prepared, and the Captain invited his nearest neighbours to come and rejoice with him over his lost son. In the meantime we gave a summary of all our bad and good fortune, which have already been detailed. I thought the old lady seemed to dwell with most pleasure on that part of it which promised so favourably in behalf of the connection, which was to take place between the two families. “Poor man, she was sorry for his loss, (meaning my uncle) but such things will happen.” As a proof of my uncle's intentions towards her son, Henry ordered his saddle-bags to be brought to him, and taking out a bag of guineas which he had received from my uncle, and which he had never opened, threw it into his mother's lap, saying, “I hope, madam, that will indemnify you and my father for the expense you have incurred on my account, though it never can obliterate that distress of mind which both must have suffered.” “Why dear me, what's all this?” said she, weighing it in her hand. “I don't know how much there is. Commodore Burlington forced it on me, and I never opened it since it has been in my possession.” “Well he is certainly—why there must be a great deal here.” (untying the bag and pouring the contents on the table.) My stars, and all guineas too!” “Pshaw!” said the old man, “what a fuss you always make about money now. I never cared for money in my life.” “Here old man, do count it.” “Faith, I'll not,” said he, “you may count it yourself.” Finding she was anxious to know the amount. I sat down and counted it for her; there were nine hundred and ninety-seven. I told her I would make it even money, and putting my hand in my pocket took out three more, which made it a thousand guineas. “Oh, dear sir, you are quite too kind, I declare—I have now more than I shall ever find use for.” She continued to poize them backwards and forwards, admiring them with great satisfaction, until her husband laughed at her for being so childish. He asked where she intended to keep them? “My dear, you must hide them better than you did your butter money.” “Indeed I will,” she answered. “I will tell you a good story,” said the old man, “about your mother.” I was sorry to hear this, as it grew near bed-time, and his stories were at any time, rather long and dull. “Last fall she was gone a visiting somewhere, I don't remember now exactly the place; but it happened that I was sent for to town, to assist at a meeting, for the purpose of nominating commissioners to settle a dispute that had arisen between us and the Cherokee Indians. Some of our people had encroached upon their lands—(I began to gape and shut my eyes)—Well she was gone, I wanted clean clothes—didn't know what to do—hated to go as I was—I expected to see every body dressed up, and she had the keys. Upon reflection, I bethought myself of a key, that opened the drawers—It belonged to the desk —(I desired the servant who waited to pull off my boots.) Stop, says I, believe I can open them—put in the key— (Wilson had his boots drawn)—and sure enough opened them as sleek as you please. Well, I turns over the things to find my clothes, and what should I come across but the old woman's bag of dollars—she wont look at a bank note—“Oh, my lad,” says I, “I'll fix you.”— I then took out the bag of dollars, and locked them up my private drawer, thinking to have some fun when she came home. Well, so it passed on for three or four weeks—(I rested my head upon my hand)—at last, to cut my story short, she went to put away more butter money, and here we had it— “My dear, somebody has stolen every cent of my money.” “They have!” said I. “Yes, they have taken every dollar.” Wilson's patience being exhausted, he put a stop to the story by saying, “indeed father it was wrong in you to plague my mother so.” “Well, gentlemen,” I observed, “I think it's time to retire.” “Oh, it is quite early yet,” replied the old gentleman. Finally we got leave to retire; we chose to sleep in the same room, though presented with two. Upon gaining our chamber I applauded my friend for his generosity to his mother. I never thought of the thing myself, but it was just what I would have done: indeed it was a very poor return for that affliction of mind his parents must have suffered on his account, and though money could have been no object with them yet still the action had a charm in it which could not fail to win upon the heart. I now accounted for his not changing his gold in New-Orleans, which I did, being unwilling to carry such a ponderous load. “I shall sponge upon you now,” he said, and well he might. Before going to sleep we held a consultation respecting the time we should set out for Boston. I observed we should find more difficulty in obtaining his parents' consent to leave them so soon as we designed, than we did in obtaining my uncle's. Wilson was of my opinion—I proposed setting out on Friday: this was Wednesday; one day I conceived was as much as we could spare, adding, that if any accident, through my neglect, had befallen my sister, I should be forever miserable. This affected Wilson like an electric shock—it roused all his energy, which was turned principally against me. He walked the floor with hasty steps, and exclaimed, “You have put me on the rack, Charles, I shall sleep none to night.” I told him calmly that we had much better deliberate on the ways and means to obtain the consent of his parents, and asked him which of us he thought possesed the most courage, as it required no small share to make the attempt. “I will,” he exclaimed, “I will myself, I will insist upon their consent—I will demand it boldly, to-morrow it shall be done.” “Very good,” I replied, “I am pleased to see you so resolute, it's more than half the battle, go to sleep now and dream of happiness—In two or three weeks you will have your bride in your arms, and poor I shall have none. I have a great mind to return and seek my Leanora instead of going with a man that's stark mad, and will be whining all the way about a bit of a girl— shame on you! Next morning I hid Wilson get up and let's see how courageously he would carry his resolution into effect. “Oh, Charles, do you open the subject, do you begin it, you can say the obligations your under to meet your uncle, you can name the condition upon which you obtained his consent to accompany me, and how hazardous it would have been had I undertaken the journey alone; in short you are much better in the art of persuasion than I am. The first word I should attempt to speak would choke me, and then my mother's tears—consider that! Oh, I shall never do it, I shall depend on you, indeed—help me out this time, dear Charles.” After laughing at him for his bravado over night. I told him to cheer up, that I would do all that lay in my power; in short, that I would not go without him, and desired he would be ready by the next day; in the mean time I should ride over to Mr —'s to enquire for letters, and should take occasion to mention the subject of our departure that morning. Accordingly next morning I proposed a walk to Capt. Wilson to look at our horses—Henry declined going— when we arrived at the lot where our horses were feeding—“I believe sir, (said I) if you will lend me a horse to ride to Mr. —'s I will let my poor fellow rest to-day, as I intend to set out for Boston to-morrow.” “Not going to leave us so soon?” “I must go sir, indeed; consider how long it is since I left my sister, heaven knows what has become of her, she may be dead, or in some extremity. I am going over to Mr. —'s, perhaps I may hear something about her—but the worst of it is, I am going to take your son along with me.” “Oh, Lord, sir, that's out of the question—his mother would run crazy; can't you stay this week and start on Monday? a day or two will make no difference.” “I cannot indeed sir; I pledged my honour to my uncle that, provided he would consent to let me accompany your son to Tennessee, we would just call to see you and proceed on to meet him in New-York; and from thence we are all to proceed to Boston together.—I hope, sir, you will not act more ungenerous towards me than he did towards your son. When we represented to him the dangers of the roads he had to travel, I suspected he himself would have accompanied him, rather than have him travel alone.” “Indeed it was very kind, very generous! I wish you had brought him with you; how I should like to see him! I'll be bound he's a hearty soul—I'll see what can be done—I have no objection on my own account; but his mother—Well, she'll only cry a little, and that she would do if he was to stay a month with her.—I suppose Henry is going to bring a wife with him this time.” “I only surmise so, I can't tell—perhaps he may— But let me have a horse, sir, I am anxious to know whether there are any letters from Boston.” He ordered a horse and we returned to the house.— Wilson examined my countenance with a scrutinizing look, when we entered the house, but whether he made any satisfactory discovery in it, or the contrary, he has never informed me, as an event turned up in the course of the day that almost deprived us both of our senses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. Upon my arrival at Mr. —'s I found two letters from my sister.—The first was dated— “May 15th, 1808. Dearest Charles— I received your kind letter of November last, in which you congratulated me on my happy asylum—alas, my dear brother! this proves how little you know of the world—much better, had it pleased Divine Providence, that I had followed my parents to the grave! Much better for me, had I been destitute of those advantages, to which alone, perhaps, I owe my present distress. But I will try and compose myself, if it be possible, for the purpose of acquainting you with the principal incidents which have happened to me of late. “For six months after you left me, the Simpsons behaved toward me with all the attention I had a right to expect; the substance of which I communicated to you, in a letter, to which your last was an answer; but since then they have proved themselves traitors of the blackest die. “I should have apprised you sooner of their conduct, and that of their accomplice, Hunter, the son of the wretch who broke the hearts of my parents; but knowing your temper I did not wish to involve you in a quarrel that might cost you your life, (my last and only stay) but could not undo the past. No, to that God to whom vengeance belongs let us leave them. “Notwithstanding the overstrained politeness of the Simpsons, I could discern from the first a great degree of pride and contempt towards me, particularly when any of the young gentlemen of the neighbourhood would call to spend a leisure hour of an evening. It sometimes happened that these young men would prefer my company and conversation to that of the Simpsons (God knows I would gladly have dispensed with the honour.) On those occasions, I could perceive their sly significant looks, the contemptuous nods and whispers.—When the gentlemen would retire I was called the belle—“no beaux for them—we stand no chance where Mary is!” All this I could have borne, but the hateful addresses of young Simpson were insupportable. Being tutored to this by his sisters. I could get no peace for him; he would intrude into my chamber, and take such liberties that I had resolved to quit the house. For several days I had kept myself locked up in my room, to avoid this detested coxcomb, scarcely taking the necessary sustenance, and whenever I left the chamber for this purpose, I was sure to meet with insults from the sisters, and impertinence from the brother. “Oh, miss is very coy sometimes, if it were such a one, or such a one, she would be more condescending.” “Though I bore this usage in silence, yet my heart was full of grief, and my eyes with tears. “One evening while I was deliberating where I should go, or what I should do, I heard the family sitting down to supper without taking the least notice of me! I had not been insulted so often as to be callous to this fresh indignity. “After the clattering of knives and forks had ceased, I walked down stairs for a candle and a glass of water. In passing through the supper-room, from which the company had not withdrawn. I discovered several gentlemen of my acquaintance, who saluted me as I passed on to the closet, which contained the candles. “I returned their salute with a silent bow, without seating myself or being invited to do so; and as I returned I discovered the son of our old enemy, (Hunter) amongst the number of guests, with his eyes bent on me. I averted my face from the group as quick as possible, and withdrew to my chamber with a trembling step and beating heart. “I heard the girls gigling a forced laugh behind me, poor souls! how truly low they appeared in my eyes at that instant.—I need not tell you how I spent the night; my dear Charles will enter too readily into my feelings: 13 I resolved, however, that it should be the last day I would spend in the house. “The next morning before breakfast I stepped across the street to a Mr. F—'s, with whom I had a slight acquaintance, and begged him to aid me “in procuring another lodging, or house to board at, until my brother would either come or send for me, saying that I could not be happy at Mr. Simpson's.” “He appeared surprised, and asked me what was the matter. I replied, “that my reasons I wished to conceal, at least until the arrival of my brother; that I had few friends in the place, and wished to say as little about the family as possible; that it was a question he could not expect me to answer, and that if he felt disposed to aid me, it were well; if not, I would intrude no longer upon him. I was much hurt that he met my confidence with such cold indifference.” “He said he would see about it, but at present he could not think of any place that would suit me. He and his family were sitting at breakfast; they invited me to sit down with them, but I could not, although I had eaten nothing since the preceding morning. After breakfast he took his hat and walked out; I imagined he was gone to engage a place for me, and resolved to await his return. He returned in about a half an hour, but I discovered from his countenance that he had done nothing for me — Not wishing to protract my visit any longer, I asked him if he had succeeded. “He replied that he had not tried, as he had had a great deal of business of his own to attend. I did not wait to hear the end of the sentence, but left the house, surmising what I afterwards found to be true, “that he had been to Simpson's, and they had prejudiced him against me.” The Miss Simpsons had been in the habit of borrowing money of me, until they had nearly deprived me of all that you gave me at parting—at length I was constrained to deny them; indeed, I had but very little left. I know you will blame me for this part of my conduct, but my dear brother you little know the sacrifices a poor friendless female is compelled to make, to secure tolerable treatment from a brutish world. I now resolved to demand my money, as well as my necklace and rings, which I had lent the girls to show out at balls and other public places. Accordingly, when I returned to their house, I walked to the young ladies' parlour, and there I beheld again the hated Hunter in close conversation with them. Telling Clarissa, the oldest, that I wished to speak with her, she got up and came towards me. On getting beyond the hearing of those in the parlour, I was going to speak, when I heard the old lady say, “I wonder where her ladyship has been gossiping last evening and this morning; she has not been either to tea or breakfast.” Advancing a step or two in that direction whence the voice proceeded, I replied, “If you mean me, madam, I was in my chamber last night. I did not come to tea because I was not sent for; I have been abroad this morning, but I don't consider myself accountable to you for my conduct.” I then turned to Miss Simpson and told her I was in want of money, and would be glad if she could return the trifle I had loaned her. “Oh dear, is that what you wanted?—Indeed, you might have saved yourself the trouble, for I haven't got any money; indeed, I never thought of such a trifle since.” She was walking off, when I addressed her again: “You say very true, madam, when you call the money I lent you a trifle; but I am in want even of that trifle.” Finding that she continued to proceed without paying further attention to me, I followed her up. “Well, madam, let me have my necklace and rings which I lent you some time since.” “I know nothing about your old rings or your necklace; ask Matilda about them. I haven't time to be standing here all day—I've something else to do.” At the same time she had two of the rings on her fingers. “The old lady now appeared—“Ma, don't you think she has the assurance to claim these rings that you know pa bought for me at the auction two years ago.” “Why, really these are fine doings; indeed, miss, you'll take the command of the house next. I wish Mr. Simpson were at home, to know what's to be done, I'm sorry he ever took you into the house.” “Yes, I wish pa was here—he'd turn her out of doors.” “You may seek another home,” rejoined the mother: “fine doings indeed—I'll have no such doings about my house.” “Madam,” said I, “I lent your daughters money and jewels; I am in want of them, and I now demand them; and as for leaving your house, I intended to do so very shortly.” “Get out of my house; begone this instant, you impudent wretch, nor dare to repeat your lies.” “Yes, indeed mama, she is the biggest liar in the world.” “I turned away from them and walking up stairs, locked up my things in my trunk, walked down stairs again, and without saying a word to the family, left the house. I remember gaining the street, and a giddiness in my head, but no more! When I recovered my senses, I found myself in a strange house, and two ladies (God I hope will reward them) were standing by me, one with hartshorn in her hand, the other with a glass of wine. To their kind enquiries I gave satisfactory answers, concealing nothing but the name of the people who had treated me so cruelly. On telling them how long it had been since I had eaten any thing, toast and tea were prepared for me in a few minutes. “After eating I felt quite restored. Mrs. Cary (that was the lady's name) said she happened to be standing in the door and seeing a gentleman running apparently as fast as he could, she stepped out to see what was the matter. On observing me extended on the pavement, she likewise ran, telling Martha (her daughter) to bring the hartshorn. This gentleman and herself brought me into her house, where I soon recovered. “This widow lady (for a widow she is) has offered me an asylum in her house. She is indigent, but humanity itself; she has one child only, a daughter, but she is a treasure; she is an angel in human shape. “In the evening as we were sitting down to tea, a gentle rap was heard at the door: it was opened by Martha, and a gentleman entered the parlour. “I beg pardon, ladies, for intruding: but I came to see how this young lady is.” “Was it to you, sir,” said I, “that I am so much indebted?” He made no answer, except by a modest bow. I thanked him as I ought, and told him I had a brother who would be proud to acknowledge the obligation, should he ever be so happy as to see him. The gentleman said he hoped I would command him in any thing; that his name was Dupon, and that he hoped I would honour him with my confidence. He took a cup of tea, and after chatting with us an hour or two, departed. Next morning I sent for my trunks, and endeavoured to be happy. The third evening after this, as Martha and myself were sitting at work, a little boy came in and handing me a paper disappeared. It ran in these words: “A stranger at No. — has a message from Miss Burlington's brother. He is confined, otherwise he would have done himself the pleasure of waiting upon her.” I flew to the place, enquired for the stranger, who was `up in a chamber.' “Show me the way,” said I. Upon entering the room, I found no one. I turned to come out, when a man rushed in, and the door locked on the outside! It was Hunter! I shrieked as loud as I was able. At that instant a voice exclaimed on the outside, “Villain, desist, and open the door this instant.” “The key is on the outside,” said I. “There is no key here.” “Then break the door down.” “If he does, I'll blow him to h—l,” said the ruffian Hunter. The door flew open and I made my escape. “Run up stairs, for God's sake, or murder will be done,” said I to two gentlemen whom I saw on gaining the street. My re-appearance, so sudden, and with looks so pale, 13* alarmed Mrs. Cary and her sympathizing daughter. I told them what had happened, and resolved never to go out alone again. It is unnecessary for me to make any comments on my situation; you must think what I feel; you must pity me; you must succour me; fly to me as quick as possible, my dear Charles. When I became sufficiently composed we sat down to supper, and my dear brother, who should enter but my kind deliverer Dupon. “Do not be alarmed, ladies, I came to see how Miss Burlington was, and reproach her for not waiting to thank me this evening.” He had several drops of blood on his bosom, which he endeavoured to conceal, and his face was much bruised. That I thanked him you are sure, but what are thanks when put in competition with his life and my safety? Heaven has certainly appointed him my guardian angel. He informed us that he apprehended some mischief from a partial discovery of the plot in the morning, while sitting in a reading room. As he was reading a newspaper he overheard two men (who sat near him) conversing earnestly in a low voice; a few words only of the subject caught his ear, viz: No. — in —street at sunset—Burlington and I'll be revenged. He knew the house to be ours from referring to a memorandum he made in his pocket book upon the day on which he carried me to it out of the street, and hearing my name pronounced, he mistrusted some evil. I hovered near your dwelling, said he, the whole of the afternoon, taking care to be armed. I saw a boy go into the house at the time mentioned, and shortly after saw you come out of it and walk very fast up the street. I followed you at a short distance, keeping my eye upon you—I was close at your heels when you entered the house. I entered it almost at the same instant, and heard the direction given to you to walk up stairs. I was so close behind you that I heard the door shut and the key turn, and gained the door the moment you shrieked out for help. I met an elderly female near the door, and had I known at the moment it was her who carried off the key, I would have sacrificed her upon the spot. I began to shiver the door with all my strength, when the old woman soon ran to me with the key, and you made your escape. I was so much enraged with the ruffian that I should have shot him dead on the spot, had the old woman not caught my arm; the moment he discovered this, he flew at me and attempted to wrest the pistol out of my hand, but finding the attempt fruitless, he struck me on the face, whilst I was engaged in shaking off the old woman. The moment he struck me. I kicked him down, and as he attempted to rise I kicked him again on the nose, and the blood gushing out I got a few drops on my vest. Just as I gave him the second kick, two gentlemen ran into the room and separated us. Hunter (that is his name) is committed, and I am held to bail—I expect to be acquitted if I could prevail on myself to have the testimony of Miss— Before he finished the sentence I interrupted him, saying that nothing would give me more pleasure than to attend his trial. I shall not conclude this, until the trial is over, which is to-morrow at ten o'clock. From the description he gave us of the other man, it must have been young Simpson. The trial is over—Dupon is acquitted and Hunter committed for further investigation. The old woman, who it appears, kept a house of suspicious character, has likewise been taken up. I shall expect you soon. Your very distressed sister. M. BURLINGTON. The other letter was as follows:— Dear Charles— What has become of you? Have you forgot your Mary? Are you alive? Oh, for heaven's sake send me but one line, but one word—I ask no more. But it is in vain—you cannot be living—what has become of Wilson? has he too forgot me? Alas then, I have no friend! ye cannot both be dead!—but I will cease to complain— Oh that God would take me to himself! There was but two—but no matter—and yet I cannot think that if living, you would forget me. My last letter you never answered—I heeded that not, as I expected to see yourself. I looked not for a letter, but I looked in vain for either. This is the last I shall trouble you with; I shall ask no more for help, where no help is to be found. In my last I disclosed enough to move a brother's affection; to move a brother's pity; to awaken a brother's honour. But my once, and ever dear Charles, that disclosure was only the beginning of sorrows. Though I despair of aid from you, yet it will relieve my oppressed heart, to pour out its feelings, whether you regard them or not. Taking up my calamitous story where I left off in my last letter to you, I continued to reside with Mrs. Cary better than three months; during which time the family was often visited by Dupon, and sometimes by other young gentlemen of his, and Mrs. Cary's acquaintance. Dupon in his various visits it appeared, had declared himself an admirer of Miss Martha. But I pass over things of no consequence, to those which ought to concern a brother deeply for a suffering sister. Briefly then, the Simpsons I suspect (for I have given myself to trouble to trace it up) reported that Mrs. Cary kept a house of equivocal character—that is in a better way, and not upon so general or notorious a plan as such houses are kept. Dupon lay under suspicions with Mrs. Cary. This report was long in circulation before its innocent subjects had the least knowledge of it. Whether Dupon had any intimation of it or not must remain a matter of conjecture, as he left the country—certain it is, that he for some time before his departure, was less frequent in his visits, and appeared thoughtful, and more distant than upon our first acquaintance. He left this place suddenly for the West Indies, where it seems he had some important business to transact. Whether this change in his behaviour, towards the family of Mrs. Cary, was the effect of distrust, or proceeded from a desire to avoid giving grounds for suspicion is equally doubtful. Before his departure he gave Mrs. Cary a draft for five hundred dollars. This act of benevolence proved a source of overwhelming distress to us all. Her drawing the money was proof, strong as holy writ, of her guilt; it confirmed the report, and poor Mrs. Cary, as innocent as an angel, was now stigmatized the worst of characters. But I will try to use some connection.—A few mornings after she drew the money, as we were sitting down to breakfast, Mr. — who owned the house she lived in, came in—he refused to be seated; but in a very peremptory manner bid her quit his house, adding that he had rented it to another person; that he desired no such person as she was to live in a house of his or so near to that in which his family resided—to be plain with you, madam, I shall suffer no such people to live near me! “This address was like a clap of thunder; the cup dropped from Mrs. Cary's hand— “What is that you say sir? such persons live near you—as he turned his back upon her with a contemptuous “good morning ladies.” It having struck me instantly that I was the cause of this unmerited reproach, I sprang after him, caught him by the breast of his coat, and implored him in a flood of tears to tell me what Mrs. Cary was accused of—my dear sir, tell me, I live with her, it concerns me. “He interrupted me with “begone you viper—you would seduce me too,” pushing me roughly from him.— I got into the house, I know not how. “What did he say?” enquired Martha, as I entered the door. “Give me my bonnet, Martha,” said her mother with great composure, though as pale as death. “Dear madam,” said I, “do take some refreshment before you walk, you have eat nothing yet,” pouring out a cup of tea for her as I spoke. “No Mary my child, none to-day, I cannot—” “I entreated her, but she gently pushed the cup from her. While Martha was putting on her bonnet and shawl, I approached her with a glass of wine, spilling great part of it, with my trembling hands—“Drink this, then,” said I, “or you will faint in the street.” “That would never do,” said she, taking the wine— “Dupon is not here to aid—me.” “She then stepped into the street and was absent, perhaps, an hour. While she was gone Martha and myself indulged in mutual condolence, suggesting a thousand conjectures—my suspicion, however, fastened on the Simpsons. “When Mrs. Cary returned she threw herself into a chair, and burst into a flood of tears! Martha sat down by her, drying her own eyes and endeavouring to comfort her mother. I walked the floor in a state of distraction, calling on the Almighty to defend the innocent hapless widow. I bewailed my hard fate in being the cause of such bitter distress; I remonstrated with him, that he did not rather let it all fall on me; I called aloud upon you—Oh, my brother, how cheerfully I would have met death at that moment! “When Mrs. Cary's grief had somewhat subsided, I threw myself on a chair before her, and taking her hands in mine—“I am the unfortunate wretch, madam, that has brought this distress upon you, my dear mother, for you are more than mother to me—can you ever forgive me? do you not repent your kindness towards me?” “Forgive you, child? you are guilty of no fault; but my children we must leave this place. No, Mary, if it were to do again, I would act the same part which I have—” “She was interrupted by a knocking at the door; I opened it and a woman entered whom I had often seen at Simpsons, and had marked her as an ignorant, vain, steel-hearted gossip, always retailing scandal. She had called twice or three times at Mrs. Cary's since I had made it my home. “Hey day,” says she, “what's the matter?” “None of us making her an answer, she stayed but a short time. She was, no doubt, sent by the Simpsons, who wished to enjoy our distress. “Mrs. Cary then went on to relate, that in the first place she went to see a Mr. — whom she had always considered in the light of a friend—he was not at home, he had set out the preceding day for Philadelphia. Not wishing to mention her distress to his wife, she left the house, and on her return called to see a Mrs. Jones, a poor but humble friend, who had received many marks of Mrs. Cary's bounty, and always appeared what she really was, grateful and sincere. To her Mrs. Cary related the shocking incident of the morning, and begged Mrs. Jones if she knew any thing respecting it, that she would conceal nothing from her. “Mrs. Jones then related to her what I have already observed above—that Mrs. Cary carried on a guilty commerce with a chosen few, that she had taken into her house a young woman of suspicious character; that Dupon was one of her favourite paramours; that she had heard young Simpson say—“By G—d Miss needn't a made such a demned fuss when Hunter—! Oh, virtue, thrice empty name!” Can you stand this, Charles? can you suffer your orphan sister's reputation to be blasted thus? I do not ask you, I would not have you risk your safety in a quarrel with these wretches—No, but I would have you take me away from here. “I pass over three weeks, which were weeks of suffering indeed! Although I suffered on a double account, yet I lost my own griefs in my assiduity to console the afflicted Mrs. Cary and her daughter, whom it was evident incurred this reproach on my account. “Mrs. Cary resolved to remove to Philadelphia, an old acquaintance of her father whom she knew in better days, lived in that city—he had written many friendly letters to her, inviting her to come and reside there.— She proposed taking me with her if I wished to go, and share her fortune, let it be what it might. “Yes, madam, said I, thanking her, I will never forsake you.” Our clothes were packed up; the day was set for our departure. “In the mean time I determined to make one more effort to obtain my dear departed mother's necklace from the Simpsons. The money I cared nothing about; but to leave Boston without the necklace, was like tearing the heart out of my body. I plucked up resolution enough to sit down and write to old Mr. Simpson, who, to do him justice, is not a bad man, if it were not for the subjection in which he is held by his wife. “I disclosed the whole business, which had hitherto been kept a secret from him. Mrs. Jones, the friend of Mrs. Cary, undertook to deliver the letter. I informed Mr. Simpson that I was about to leave Boston, and that the money his daughters borrowed of me they were welcome to keep; but the necklace and rings I must have, as they were all that remained to me of my dear mother. “Mrs. Jones said, when the old gentleman read the letter, he was very angry, and commanded them to send the jewels. “It is,” said he, “a darnation shame to detain any thing belonging to her.” “By Ned,” said young Simpson, “that's a pretty high move.” “The old woman joined with him, “she is an impudent liar; Clarissa bought the necklace from her, she gave her another for it, and a pea-green silk dress, as good as new.” “Yes, indeed papa, that is the truth, I wish I had mine back again.” “But the money—what did you want?” “She's a lying slut.” “Mrs. Jones said they all fell on the old man—Finally, Charles, not to trouble you further, I had to leave Boston without them. “The day arrived when we were to leave Boston— our trunks were in the front room—we had breakfasted —Mrs. Cary had put on her bonnet to go and pay the rent, and deliver up the keys of the house; but an officer stepped in and seized the trunks; Mrs. Cary now paid to him the rent, and also his fee. “Nothing remained for us but to set out as soon as possible. Our trunks were conveyed on board—I sent Betsey, the only domestic Mrs. Cary had, and who determined not to forsake us, for a bottle of wine; we left out three glasses for the purpose of taking something to enable us to walk to the vessel. “Mrs. Jones was with us—the wine came—we took a glass round—not a word was uttered. We walked along silent and slow. Mrs. Jones, the only kind friend we had, walked with us. I am now on board.—Mrs. Jones takes this to the Post-Office. Your heart-broken Sister.” Inured as I was to misfortunes, my fortitude entirely forsook me under this new calamity. To describe my feelings would be mockery I remember nothing until I arrived at Captain Wilson's house—I threw the letters to Wilson, telling him we must set out as soon as possible. He ran them hastily over, and bursting into exclamations of rage and indignation against all mankind, said he was ready. I pitied Wilson—he was frantic; I took the letters from him and handed them to Captain Wilson, telling him I must set out directly. “What?” said the old man. “Read the letter,” said I, and taking Wilson's arm I lead him out of the house. We traversed the yard backwards and forwards without speaking a word. At length a negro came to us and said, “Mistress says you can't start till arter dinner, at any rate; your clothes are wet and they wont be ready in time.” I consented to wait till after dinner: though my own grief was pungent enough, it was swallowed up by that of Wilson's. I attempted to rally his spirits once more, by telling him I would go into the house, and make the old Pattawattama Chief (as Captain Wilson was often called) produce his Redstone. “Come in,” said I, “we'll drown our sorrow in the bowl.”—Dragging him into the house, I requested his father “to give us some of his best.” The old Redstone soon sparkled on the table, with loaf sugar, nutmeg and water. I told him that Henry seemed rather in low spirits, and I had prescribed a bumper of toddy. “Oh, it's the best thing in the world for it. I had one—” I was afraid of another long story, and interrupted him by asking “if he had any wine? that Wilson was so much of a woman he would not drink enough of the old Pennsylvania.” Wine was soon produced, but we declined it till dinner, and all three took a very liberal glass of toddy. I knew I would pay for it, but I was little concerned for 14 consequences. I would as soon have died as not, yet still I had to appear cheerful to keep Wilson in heart. The glass went round pretty brisk, and we were about half-seas-over before dinner. I expected to see the old man knocked up, but he was too tough. The cloth was laid, and Captain Wilson ordered our horses; he directed Ned to saddle old Tory for him. He would go with us as far as—to see us on our way. “Stay all night, and we'll have a spree, boys; I'll knock all these hypo-notions out o' your heads. I wouldn't give a cent for a man that would grieve about any thing. I'll spend one more night with you, and we'll be as merry as hay-makers, when the sun shines.” The old lady now made her appearance with a bottle in one hand, and wiping her eyes on her apron with the other, slid the bottle on the table. This was the farewell treat, as no doubt she had heard the orders given to saddle. “Oh yes,” said the old man, “there's something good, boys, I expect. The d—l a drop would I have got of it if you hadn't a come; she would a' kept it seven years longer for Henry.” Upon tasting it, it proved to be luscious raspberry bounce, which the Virginia ladies are so famed for making. In the meantime dinner was served—our clothes were ready. They are packed up—Ned has our horses at the gate, together with old Tory and one for himself. Wilson and his father had concluded while I was absent in the morning, that we had better take the stage at Knoxville—Ned was going on with us to bring back the horses. After the word “that all was ready,” there was a long pause I stepped to the table, and filling the glasses, invited Mrs. Wilson to pledge me in a glass of her bounce: telling Wilson and his father to unite in a stirrup-cup, and let us be off, as it was growing late. The old lady approached, her eyes red with weeping; she picked up the glass, and carrying it slowly to her lips, with a faultering voice wished us a pleasant journey, and turned off the glass, at which some of your affected ladies would have made a hundred excuses. The others having followed our example, I stepped up to Mrs. Wilson and taking her by the hand, desired her to be of good cheer, that we would soon return and tire her out. I then walked out and mounted my horse; the old gentleman soon followed—but Henry! alas! his mother hung to him—he walked to the gate—he walked through the gate—Now poor Mrs. Wilson I felt for her—I could see her heart beat. The old man seeing Henry's hesitation, exclaimed, “d—n it, don't be standing there all day, like a goslin by the side of a goose; kiss your mother and come along.” This was enough—Wilson was soon alongside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“May 15th, 1808. Dearest Charles— I received your kind letter of November last, in which you congratulated me on my happy asylum—alas, my dear brother! this proves how little you know of the world—much better, had it pleased Divine Providence, that I had followed my parents to the grave! Much better for me, had I been destitute of those advantages, to which alone, perhaps, I owe my present distress. But I will try and compose myself, if it be possible, for the purpose of acquainting you with the principal incidents which have happened to me of late. “For six months after you left me, the Simpsons behaved toward me with all the attention I had a right to expect; the substance of which I communicated to you, in a letter, to which your last was an answer; but since then they have proved themselves traitors of the blackest die. “I should have apprised you sooner of their conduct, and that of their accomplice, Hunter, the son of the wretch who broke the hearts of my parents; but knowing your temper I did not wish to involve you in a quarrel that might cost you your life, (my last and only stay) but could not undo the past. No, to that God to whom vengeance belongs let us leave them. “Notwithstanding the overstrained politeness of the Simpsons, I could discern from the first a great degree of pride and contempt towards me, particularly when any of the young gentlemen of the neighbourhood would call to spend a leisure hour of an evening. It sometimes happened that these young men would prefer my company and conversation to that of the Simpsons (God knows I would gladly have dispensed with the honour.) On those occasions, I could perceive their sly significant looks, the contemptuous nods and whispers.—When the gentlemen would retire I was called the belle—“no beaux for them—we stand no chance where Mary is!” All this I could have borne, but the hateful addresses of young Simpson were insupportable. Being tutored to this by his sisters. I could get no peace for him; he would intrude into my chamber, and take such liberties that I had resolved to quit the house. For several days I had kept myself locked up in my room, to avoid this detested coxcomb, scarcely taking the necessary sustenance, and whenever I left the chamber for this purpose, I was sure to meet with insults from the sisters, and impertinence from the brother. “Oh, miss is very coy sometimes, if it were such a one, or such a one, she would be more condescending.” “Though I bore this usage in silence, yet my heart was full of grief, and my eyes with tears. “One evening while I was deliberating where I should go, or what I should do, I heard the family sitting down to supper without taking the least notice of me! I had not been insulted so often as to be callous to this fresh indignity. “After the clattering of knives and forks had ceased, I walked down stairs for a candle and a glass of water. In passing through the supper-room, from which the company had not withdrawn. I discovered several gentlemen of my acquaintance, who saluted me as I passed on to the closet, which contained the candles. “I returned their salute with a silent bow, without seating myself or being invited to do so; and as I returned I discovered the son of our old enemy, (Hunter) amongst the number of guests, with his eyes bent on me. I averted my face from the group as quick as possible, and withdrew to my chamber with a trembling step and beating heart. “I heard the girls gigling a forced laugh behind me, poor souls! how truly low they appeared in my eyes at that instant.—I need not tell you how I spent the night; my dear Charles will enter too readily into my feelings: 13 I resolved, however, that it should be the last day I would spend in the house. “The next morning before breakfast I stepped across the street to a Mr. F—'s, with whom I had a slight acquaintance, and begged him to aid me “in procuring another lodging, or house to board at, until my brother would either come or send for me, saying that I could not be happy at Mr. Simpson's.” “He appeared surprised, and asked me what was the matter. I replied, “that my reasons I wished to conceal, at least until the arrival of my brother; that I had few friends in the place, and wished to say as little about the family as possible; that it was a question he could not expect me to answer, and that if he felt disposed to aid me, it were well; if not, I would intrude no longer upon him. I was much hurt that he met my confidence with such cold indifference.” “He said he would see about it, but at present he could not think of any place that would suit me. He and his family were sitting at breakfast; they invited me to sit down with them, but I could not, although I had eaten nothing since the preceding morning. After breakfast he took his hat and walked out; I imagined he was gone to engage a place for me, and resolved to await his return. He returned in about a half an hour, but I discovered from his countenance that he had done nothing for me — Not wishing to protract my visit any longer, I asked him if he had succeeded. “He replied that he had not tried, as he had had a great deal of business of his own to attend. I did not wait to hear the end of the sentence, but left the house, surmising what I afterwards found to be true, “that he had been to Simpson's, and they had prejudiced him against me.” The Miss Simpsons had been in the habit of borrowing money of me, until they had nearly deprived me of all that you gave me at parting—at length I was constrained to deny them; indeed, I had but very little left. I know you will blame me for this part of my conduct, but my dear brother you little know the sacrifices a poor friendless female is compelled to make, to secure tolerable treatment from a brutish world. I now resolved to demand my money, as well as my necklace and rings, which I had lent the girls to show out at balls and other public places. Accordingly, when I returned to their house, I walked to the young ladies' parlour, and there I beheld again the hated Hunter in close conversation with them. Telling Clarissa, the oldest, that I wished to speak with her, she got up and came towards me. On getting beyond the hearing of those in the parlour, I was going to speak, when I heard the old lady say, “I wonder where her ladyship has been gossiping last evening and this morning; she has not been either to tea or breakfast.” Advancing a step or two in that direction whence the voice proceeded, I replied, “If you mean me, madam, I was in my chamber last night. I did not come to tea because I was not sent for; I have been abroad this morning, but I don't consider myself accountable to you for my conduct.” I then turned to Miss Simpson and told her I was in want of money, and would be glad if she could return the trifle I had loaned her. “Oh dear, is that what you wanted?—Indeed, you might have saved yourself the trouble, for I haven't got any money; indeed, I never thought of such a trifle since.” She was walking off, when I addressed her again: “You say very true, madam, when you call the money I lent you a trifle; but I am in want even of that trifle.” Finding that she continued to proceed without paying further attention to me, I followed her up. “Well, madam, let me have my necklace and rings which I lent you some time since.” “I know nothing about your old rings or your necklace; ask Matilda about them. I haven't time to be standing here all day—I've something else to do.” At the same time she had two of the rings on her fingers. “The old lady now appeared—“Ma, don't you think she has the assurance to claim these rings that you know pa bought for me at the auction two years ago.” “Why, really these are fine doings; indeed, miss, you'll take the command of the house next. I wish Mr. Simpson were at home, to know what's to be done, I'm sorry he ever took you into the house.” “Yes, I wish pa was here—he'd turn her out of doors.” “You may seek another home,” rejoined the mother: “fine doings indeed—I'll have no such doings about my house.” “Madam,” said I, “I lent your daughters money and jewels; I am in want of them, and I now demand them; and as for leaving your house, I intended to do so very shortly.” “Get out of my house; begone this instant, you impudent wretch, nor dare to repeat your lies.” “Yes, indeed mama, she is the biggest liar in the world.” “I turned away from them and walking up stairs, locked up my things in my trunk, walked down stairs again, and without saying a word to the family, left the house. I remember gaining the street, and a giddiness in my head, but no more! When I recovered my senses, I found myself in a strange house, and two ladies (God I hope will reward them) were standing by me, one with hartshorn in her hand, the other with a glass of wine. To their kind enquiries I gave satisfactory answers, concealing nothing but the name of the people who had treated me so cruelly. On telling them how long it had been since I had eaten any thing, toast and tea were prepared for me in a few minutes. “After eating I felt quite restored. Mrs. Cary (that was the lady's name) said she happened to be standing in the door and seeing a gentleman running apparently as fast as he could, she stepped out to see what was the matter. On observing me extended on the pavement, she likewise ran, telling Martha (her daughter) to bring the hartshorn. This gentleman and herself brought me into her house, where I soon recovered. “This widow lady (for a widow she is) has offered me an asylum in her house. She is indigent, but humanity itself; she has one child only, a daughter, but she is a treasure; she is an angel in human shape. “In the evening as we were sitting down to tea, a gentle rap was heard at the door: it was opened by Martha, and a gentleman entered the parlour. “I beg pardon, ladies, for intruding: but I came to see how this young lady is.” “Was it to you, sir,” said I, “that I am so much indebted?” He made no answer, except by a modest bow. I thanked him as I ought, and told him I had a brother who would be proud to acknowledge the obligation, should he ever be so happy as to see him. The gentleman said he hoped I would command him in any thing; that his name was Dupon, and that he hoped I would honour him with my confidence. He took a cup of tea, and after chatting with us an hour or two, departed. Next morning I sent for my trunks, and endeavoured to be happy. The third evening after this, as Martha and myself were sitting at work, a little boy came in and handing me a paper disappeared. It ran in these words: “A stranger at No. — has a message from Miss Burlington's brother. He is confined, otherwise he would have done himself the pleasure of waiting upon her.” I flew to the place, enquired for the stranger, who was `up in a chamber.' “Show me the way,” said I. Upon entering the room, I found no one. I turned to come out, when a man rushed in, and the door locked on the outside! It was Hunter! I shrieked as loud as I was able. At that instant a voice exclaimed on the outside, “Villain, desist, and open the door this instant.” “The key is on the outside,” said I. “There is no key here.” “Then break the door down.” “If he does, I'll blow him to h—l,” said the ruffian Hunter. The door flew open and I made my escape. “Run up stairs, for God's sake, or murder will be done,” said I to two gentlemen whom I saw on gaining the street. My re-appearance, so sudden, and with looks so pale, 13* alarmed Mrs. Cary and her sympathizing daughter. I told them what had happened, and resolved never to go out alone again. It is unnecessary for me to make any comments on my situation; you must think what I feel; you must pity me; you must succour me; fly to me as quick as possible, my dear Charles. When I became sufficiently composed we sat down to supper, and my dear brother, who should enter but my kind deliverer Dupon. “Do not be alarmed, ladies, I came to see how Miss Burlington was, and reproach her for not waiting to thank me this evening.” He had several drops of blood on his bosom, which he endeavoured to conceal, and his face was much bruised. That I thanked him you are sure, but what are thanks when put in competition with his life and my safety? Heaven has certainly appointed him my guardian angel. He informed us that he apprehended some mischief from a partial discovery of the plot in the morning, while sitting in a reading room. As he was reading a newspaper he overheard two men (who sat near him) conversing earnestly in a low voice; a few words only of the subject caught his ear, viz: No. — in —street at sunset—Burlington and I'll be revenged. He knew the house to be ours from referring to a memorandum he made in his pocket book upon the day on which he carried me to it out of the street, and hearing my name pronounced, he mistrusted some evil. I hovered near your dwelling, said he, the whole of the afternoon, taking care to be armed. I saw a boy go into the house at the time mentioned, and shortly after saw you come out of it and walk very fast up the street. I followed you at a short distance, keeping my eye upon you—I was close at your heels when you entered the house. I entered it almost at the same instant, and heard the direction given to you to walk up stairs. I was so close behind you that I heard the door shut and the key turn, and gained the door the moment you shrieked out for help. I met an elderly female near the door, and had I known at the moment it was her who carried off the key, I would have sacrificed her upon the spot. I began to shiver the door with all my strength, when the old woman soon ran to me with the key, and you made your escape. I was so much enraged with the ruffian that I should have shot him dead on the spot, had the old woman not caught my arm; the moment he discovered this, he flew at me and attempted to wrest the pistol out of my hand, but finding the attempt fruitless, he struck me on the face, whilst I was engaged in shaking off the old woman. The moment he struck me. I kicked him down, and as he attempted to rise I kicked him again on the nose, and the blood gushing out I got a few drops on my vest. Just as I gave him the second kick, two gentlemen ran into the room and separated us. Hunter (that is his name) is committed, and I am held to bail—I expect to be acquitted if I could prevail on myself to have the testimony of Miss— Before he finished the sentence I interrupted him, saying that nothing would give me more pleasure than to attend his trial. I shall not conclude this, until the trial is over, which is to-morrow at ten o'clock. From the description he gave us of the other man, it must have been young Simpson. The trial is over—Dupon is acquitted and Hunter committed for further investigation. The old woman, who it appears, kept a house of suspicious character, has likewise been taken up. I shall expect you soon. Your very distressed sister. M. BURLINGTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Charles— What has become of you? Have you forgot your Mary? Are you alive? Oh, for heaven's sake send me but one line, but one word—I ask no more. But it is in vain—you cannot be living—what has become of Wilson? has he too forgot me? Alas then, I have no friend! ye cannot both be dead!—but I will cease to complain— Oh that God would take me to himself! There was but two—but no matter—and yet I cannot think that if living, you would forget me. My last letter you never answered—I heeded that not, as I expected to see yourself. I looked not for a letter, but I looked in vain for either. This is the last I shall trouble you with; I shall ask no more for help, where no help is to be found. In my last I disclosed enough to move a brother's affection; to move a brother's pity; to awaken a brother's honour. But my once, and ever dear Charles, that disclosure was only the beginning of sorrows. Though I despair of aid from you, yet it will relieve my oppressed heart, to pour out its feelings, whether you regard them or not. Taking up my calamitous story where I left off in my last letter to you, I continued to reside with Mrs. Cary better than three months; during which time the family was often visited by Dupon, and sometimes by other young gentlemen of his, and Mrs. Cary's acquaintance. Dupon in his various visits it appeared, had declared himself an admirer of Miss Martha. But I pass over things of no consequence, to those which ought to concern a brother deeply for a suffering sister. Briefly then, the Simpsons I suspect (for I have given myself to trouble to trace it up) reported that Mrs. Cary kept a house of equivocal character—that is in a better way, and not upon so general or notorious a plan as such houses are kept. Dupon lay under suspicions with Mrs. Cary. This report was long in circulation before its innocent subjects had the least knowledge of it. Whether Dupon had any intimation of it or not must remain a matter of conjecture, as he left the country—certain it is, that he for some time before his departure, was less frequent in his visits, and appeared thoughtful, and more distant than upon our first acquaintance. He left this place suddenly for the West Indies, where it seems he had some important business to transact. Whether this change in his behaviour, towards the family of Mrs. Cary, was the effect of distrust, or proceeded from a desire to avoid giving grounds for suspicion is equally doubtful. Before his departure he gave Mrs. Cary a draft for five hundred dollars. This act of benevolence proved a source of overwhelming distress to us all. Her drawing the money was proof, strong as holy writ, of her guilt; it confirmed the report, and poor Mrs. Cary, as innocent as an angel, was now stigmatized the worst of characters. But I will try to use some connection.—A few mornings after she drew the money, as we were sitting down to breakfast, Mr. — who owned the house she lived in, came in—he refused to be seated; but in a very peremptory manner bid her quit his house, adding that he had rented it to another person; that he desired no such person as she was to live in a house of his or so near to that in which his family resided—to be plain with you, madam, I shall suffer no such people to live near me! “This address was like a clap of thunder; the cup dropped from Mrs. Cary's hand— “What is that you say sir? such persons live near you—as he turned his back upon her with a contemptuous “good morning ladies.” It having struck me instantly that I was the cause of this unmerited reproach, I sprang after him, caught him by the breast of his coat, and implored him in a flood of tears to tell me what Mrs. Cary was accused of—my dear sir, tell me, I live with her, it concerns me. “He interrupted me with “begone you viper—you would seduce me too,” pushing me roughly from him.— I got into the house, I know not how. “What did he say?” enquired Martha, as I entered the door. “Give me my bonnet, Martha,” said her mother with great composure, though as pale as death. “Dear madam,” said I, “do take some refreshment before you walk, you have eat nothing yet,” pouring out a cup of tea for her as I spoke. “No Mary my child, none to-day, I cannot—” “I entreated her, but she gently pushed the cup from her. While Martha was putting on her bonnet and shawl, I approached her with a glass of wine, spilling great part of it, with my trembling hands—“Drink this, then,” said I, “or you will faint in the street.” “That would never do,” said she, taking the wine— “Dupon is not here to aid—me.” “She then stepped into the street and was absent, perhaps, an hour. While she was gone Martha and myself indulged in mutual condolence, suggesting a thousand conjectures—my suspicion, however, fastened on the Simpsons. “When Mrs. Cary returned she threw herself into a chair, and burst into a flood of tears! Martha sat down by her, drying her own eyes and endeavouring to comfort her mother. I walked the floor in a state of distraction, calling on the Almighty to defend the innocent hapless widow. I bewailed my hard fate in being the cause of such bitter distress; I remonstrated with him, that he did not rather let it all fall on me; I called aloud upon you—Oh, my brother, how cheerfully I would have met death at that moment! “When Mrs. Cary's grief had somewhat subsided, I threw myself on a chair before her, and taking her hands in mine—“I am the unfortunate wretch, madam, that has brought this distress upon you, my dear mother, for you are more than mother to me—can you ever forgive me? do you not repent your kindness towards me?” “Forgive you, child? you are guilty of no fault; but my children we must leave this place. No, Mary, if it were to do again, I would act the same part which I have—” “She was interrupted by a knocking at the door; I opened it and a woman entered whom I had often seen at Simpsons, and had marked her as an ignorant, vain, steel-hearted gossip, always retailing scandal. She had called twice or three times at Mrs. Cary's since I had made it my home. “Hey day,” says she, “what's the matter?” “None of us making her an answer, she stayed but a short time. She was, no doubt, sent by the Simpsons, who wished to enjoy our distress. “Mrs. Cary then went on to relate, that in the first place she went to see a Mr. — whom she had always considered in the light of a friend—he was not at home, he had set out the preceding day for Philadelphia. Not wishing to mention her distress to his wife, she left the house, and on her return called to see a Mrs. Jones, a poor but humble friend, who had received many marks of Mrs. Cary's bounty, and always appeared what she really was, grateful and sincere. To her Mrs. Cary related the shocking incident of the morning, and begged Mrs. Jones if she knew any thing respecting it, that she would conceal nothing from her. “Mrs. Jones then related to her what I have already observed above—that Mrs. Cary carried on a guilty commerce with a chosen few, that she had taken into her house a young woman of suspicious character; that Dupon was one of her favourite paramours; that she had heard young Simpson say—“By G—d Miss needn't a made such a demned fuss when Hunter—! Oh, virtue, thrice empty name!” Can you stand this, Charles? can you suffer your orphan sister's reputation to be blasted thus? I do not ask you, I would not have you risk your safety in a quarrel with these wretches—No, but I would have you take me away from here. “I pass over three weeks, which were weeks of suffering indeed! Although I suffered on a double account, yet I lost my own griefs in my assiduity to console the afflicted Mrs. Cary and her daughter, whom it was evident incurred this reproach on my account. “Mrs. Cary resolved to remove to Philadelphia, an old acquaintance of her father whom she knew in better days, lived in that city—he had written many friendly letters to her, inviting her to come and reside there.— She proposed taking me with her if I wished to go, and share her fortune, let it be what it might. “Yes, madam, said I, thanking her, I will never forsake you.” Our clothes were packed up; the day was set for our departure. “In the mean time I determined to make one more effort to obtain my dear departed mother's necklace from the Simpsons. The money I cared nothing about; but to leave Boston without the necklace, was like tearing the heart out of my body. I plucked up resolution enough to sit down and write to old Mr. Simpson, who, to do him justice, is not a bad man, if it were not for the subjection in which he is held by his wife. “I disclosed the whole business, which had hitherto been kept a secret from him. Mrs. Jones, the friend of Mrs. Cary, undertook to deliver the letter. I informed Mr. Simpson that I was about to leave Boston, and that the money his daughters borrowed of me they were welcome to keep; but the necklace and rings I must have, as they were all that remained to me of my dear mother. “Mrs. Jones said, when the old gentleman read the letter, he was very angry, and commanded them to send the jewels. “It is,” said he, “a darnation shame to detain any thing belonging to her.” “By Ned,” said young Simpson, “that's a pretty high move.” “The old woman joined with him, “she is an impudent liar; Clarissa bought the necklace from her, she gave her another for it, and a pea-green silk dress, as good as new.” “Yes, indeed papa, that is the truth, I wish I had mine back again.” “But the money—what did you want?” “She's a lying slut.” “Mrs. Jones said they all fell on the old man—Finally, Charles, not to trouble you further, I had to leave Boston without them. “The day arrived when we were to leave Boston— our trunks were in the front room—we had breakfasted —Mrs. Cary had put on her bonnet to go and pay the rent, and deliver up the keys of the house; but an officer stepped in and seized the trunks; Mrs. Cary now paid to him the rent, and also his fee. “Nothing remained for us but to set out as soon as possible. Our trunks were conveyed on board—I sent Betsey, the only domestic Mrs. Cary had, and who determined not to forsake us, for a bottle of wine; we left out three glasses for the purpose of taking something to enable us to walk to the vessel. “Mrs. Jones was with us—the wine came—we took a glass round—not a word was uttered. We walked along silent and slow. Mrs. Jones, the only kind friend we had, walked with us. I am now on board.—Mrs. Jones takes this to the Post-Office. Your heart-broken Sister.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. I admire a man of independence. Had it been otherwise with Captain Wilson, this day would have been a day of perplexity to us all. There is as much difference between the poor, pitiful, mean-spirited wretch, who is subject to his wife, and the man who nobly maintains his own prerogative, as there is between the reptile that creeps on the ground, and the noble Lion. Henry rode in the van in silence; the old man and myself rode side by side, while Ned brought up the rear. I roused Wilson from his profound meditation, by asking him “how he came on?” “Oh he'll do well enough, now he's got clear of the old woman; no danger of Henry,” said his father. “Oh, curse the stuff—I'm sick as death and almost drunk,” said Henry. I observed “if he went on as he had to-day, we would be taken for worse than drunk—we would be taken for mad people.” Captain Wilson, who had served in the revolutionary war, entered upon a detail of his former exploits, and of those brave men who were associated with him. I dare say he did justice to those heroes of our nation—but I remember but very little about it, for the trees began to dance before me, and my head ached violently. We soon took up more company; three gentleman, two elderly, and a spruce looking young beau. I was glad of it, as it relieved me from attending to Captain Wilson's long stories. I fell back, and Wilson told me he was very sick, and wanted some water badly. Neither he nor I had indulged in the practice of drinking any thing, excepting perhaps a bottle of porter, or a little wine occasionally. It therefore was no wonder that it had a different effect on us, to what it had on the old man, who was proof against accidents of this nature. As we now had an opportunity, Wilson enquired how I happened to succeed so effectually, in bringing the old man over, to consent so readily as he did to our journey? I repeated to him the conversation which took place between his father and me, adding that when I left him, I was not so confident of success. He said that his father after my departure called his mother to him, and desired her to have the boys' clothes ready that night, that they were compelled to set out early in the morning. “Indeed my dear, Henry must not leave me so soon.” “Leave the d—l, I say their clothes shall be got ready. Do you think I would be outdone by the generosity of the boy's uncle, that let him come so far to guard my son? No—I'm not so selfish as all that, and gave him such a handsome present too, because he was the friend of his nephew? Zucks, I am a great mind to go with him myself, to thank his uncle in person for his noble behaviour to my son. No, no, they shall go—no shufffing in ranks.” Henry said there was no more objecting on the part of his mother. At this moment Captain Wilson called to Ned to produce the bottle and cup, adding “here is the finest spring in Tennessee.” This was agreeable news—but I had no idea of this providential precaution of the old man, in bringing his friend Redstone with him; nor had I the least inclination to renew my acquaintance with this old friend of his. “Gentlemen,” said he to the strangers, “here is some as genuine Monongahela as ever came down the river. It was warranted ten years old.” By this time we had all dismounted—the strangers accepted the invitation, but no entreaty could prevail on Wilson or me to join them—we chose rather a draught of pure water. So soon as the strangers had done honour to our fellow-traveller, the dram-bottle, one of them stepped to his saddle bags and pulled out a Spanish bottle, [10] [10] A Spanish bottle is solely intended for travelling. If the reader can imagine a common green quart bottle, pressed flat like a flask, decreasing towards the bottom; in thickness like a wedge, the neck a foot in length and of great strength, he will have an accurate idea of a Spanish bottle. observing to our old friend, “that his Redstone 14* was very good it was true, but he thought he had some equally as good,” and invited him to drink. The old man tasted it, shook the bottle to observe the bead; tasted it again, “faith I believe it is the best; well, curse them fellows, they sold it to me for ten years old.” I thought he seemed a little mortified that he failed to excel. We mounted our horses again and pursued our journey. Calling at a house that stood near the spring to enquire the distance to our stand: we were told it was eight miles. The sun was low, however, the draught of cold water and the coolness of the evening, tended very much to relieve our sickness, and enabled us to keep up with the company, who rode merrily on before, Wilson and I bringing up the rear, by which means we lost the pleasure of hearing the history of the spring, which Captain Wilson commenced just as he mounted his horse, after refreshing himself with a draught of its waters. All that struck my ear respecting the subject was “that the first time he saw it was seventeen years since; that he and three others were on a visit to look at the country, and being tired, thirsty, and hungry, they stopped to rest themselves under the shade of the trees that surrounded the spring. Having buiscuit, neats-tongue and cheese, (and I dare say a bottle of the comfortable, though it escaped my ear) they made a sumptuous meal. The old gentleman having the advantage of a fresh spur in the head, it was with difficulty we could keep up with old Tory. It was laughable to witness his progress between a pace and a gallop, which proved that he was perfectly aware how matters stood with his master. Wilson reproved me for laughing—“when you know without a miracle, your sister must ere this have fallen a sacrifice either to want or ill treatment.” “Oh don't be prophesying ill,” said I—“bad news will come soon enough; keep a good heart; our luck has turned; I expect Mary is alive and well, and grieving will do no good; it is useless to afflict ourselves till we know for what.” With such conversation as this, we passed off the time until we arrived at the inn, where we found a good fire, which proved very agreeable. It appeared that one of our fellow-travellers was likewise an old revolutionary soldier, and by birth was a South Carolinian. Captain Wilson was soon in the height of his glory. They had both served in the southern department, and under the same commanders; all their battles were revived again. The conversation, however, had not enough of interest in it to engage my attention, until I was roused by an oath from the Captain, execrating a black woman who had jerked up the candle without ceremony and disappeared with it, just as he had the line of battle completed at Camden. The two armies, however, could not engage for want of a light. I remonstrated with the old gentleman for using such harsh language to one of the fair sex. She soon, however, returned with the candle. He resumed—“I held a Captain's commission, and one of my men began to cry, and says to me, `Oh, Captain, we'll all be killed—don't you see the British? look at their cannon, pointing right towards us.' `You d—n son of a b—h,' says I, drawing my sword, `if you don't hush, I'll run you through—where the d—l do you think they would point them, then?' It was a capital mistake in Gates, absolutely to be sure, to order militia to charge with bayonets at the month of the British cannon. I could freely have seen him shot. However, the North Carolinians broke and run like the d—l, and the Virginia line began to give ground.” “I think you all run, father,” said Henry. “Faith, I covered the retreat,” said the old man, being unwilling to meet the question. “The Marylanders, oh they were fine fellows! I could hear them firing at the advance of the British. O, how I wanted to go back and help them.” In all likelyhood he would have protracted his retreat to an hour's length, had he not, with the rest of us, been called to supper. Happening to sit opposite to him at table, the remark of the negro woman popped into his head. “What was that? I wish I could think of it, about the woman's taking away the candle.” Some of the party reminded him— “Oh, yes, and Hal too about our running at Gates' defeat, a sly dog; this morning it was nothing but whining and lamenting. I have a great mind to tell on you both my lads; I haven't forgot the spree; I'll see if we can't have John Anderson after supper. Landlord, make a gallon of toddy, and do your best upon it; it aint every night we'll be together, and God knows maybe we'll never meet again—his will be done; and as for this Mr. Charles with his fair sex, and all that sort o' thing we'll see if he can't sing as well as he used to do.” All this was a sad blow to my hopes, as Wilson and I had made it up to slip off to bed as soon as we arose from the table; but it was all over with us now. Supper being over the cloth was removed, and the toddy-glasses, &amp;c. placed on the table, the landlord was invited to join with us. Wilson sighed deeply; for my own part I submitted with as much grace as I could command, knowing that remonstrance was vain. Having all drank round I had to begin the first song, and gave them John Anderson my jo. Wilson eyed me with evident signs of displeasure, as (of course) he would have to follow. My performance was received with great applause. Henry escaped however this time, and our young fellow guest gave us the Legacy, quite in taste. All must drink again. “Now Hal,” said his father, “let them gentlemen hear that you can sing too; let me see, what song is that he used to charm his mother with—” I asked him if it was not Kitty of the Clyde. “Oh, yes, that's the very thing.” Poor Henry had to comply; when he was done I observed it was the old gentleman's turn next. The Captain began, “when I was a young man stout and brave,” without any hesitation. When he had done we must all drink again—I had much rather have sung all night.— The two elder of the guests were called on next, one declared off, saying he never sung in his life. I said he must tell a story then; it occurred to me that if I could get a story afloat it would be the means of drawing the old man into one of his long stories, and by that means we might find an opportunity of making our escape. He compromised by agreeing to tell a story after his friend had favoured us with a song. He gave us “the loss of Paddy's Mill,” a song of Allan Ramsey's composition; when this was ended, the other told us the story of Kate Snyder, which every body knows; but he told it to admiration. After him I told one very similar to it—this put an end to the singing. As I had foreseen, Captain Wilson began one of his hour long stories; I made a sign to Henry to retire, choosing to stay a little longer, to make an excuse for for him, should he be missed The young gentleman soon followed him, and I remained but a short time behind, when I also withdrew, leaving the old man to finish his story and toddy together. We soon fell asleep, and slept sound until I was awaked by Captain Wilson, who came into our chamber and called to us to get up, saying our fellow travellers were up an hour ago, and were ready to ride, adding that he had a foaming egg'nog ready, and a julep as good as ever was drank. We jumped up, and after dressing and washing, took a glass of julep, the egg'nog looking rather too lucious for our stomachs. I was well pleased, however, that our fellow travellers joined the Captain in partaking with him, in the egg'nog. All having drank, and our horses ready, I proposed to ride, to which the guests assented. Captain Wilson had settled our bills—nothing therefore remained but to bid him adieu. Going up to him I told him the best of friends must part; he shook me cordially by the hand— wishing me all the success in the world; he walked a short distance with us before taking leave of his son, and here a violent contest took place, between the old man and Henry; Captain Wilson was endeavouring to force a purse of money on him, which Henry as peremptorily refused. At length he came to me and sorrowfully entreated me to take it —“My dear sir,” said I, “we do not want it indeed; I have a much greater quantity now than is, perhaps, safe to travel with; do excuse us—you know sir that if I wanted that or any other favour from you, I would use no ceremony. He semed to be somewhat satisfied, but observed that, “some accident might befal us.” “And if there should sir,” I rejoined, “we have another father where we are going, therefore it is quite unnecessary, and even dangerous.” This called up all of the good old man's tenderness— the big tear trembled in his eye. “Take care of yourselves my boys,” said he, as I squeezed his hand for the last time, and then rode forward to overtake my companions, who had all moved on. “Give my kind respects to your uncle,” said Captain Wilson, as I parted from him—“bring him with you if possible.” In three days we reached Knoxville, where with much regret we parted with our fellow travellers; they pursuing their journey on horseback, while we took the stage; sending Ned back with the horses, with many kind compliments to Captain Wilson and his lady. In seven days we arrived in Philadelphia, without meeting with any thing worthy of notice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. Upon our arrival in Philadelphia, our first business was, to enquire for Mrs. Cary; no one knew any thing about her: we walked until we were weary, enquiring of almost every one we met.—We searched the newspapers and missed no place where we thought there was any probability of gaining intelligence, but all to no purpose. Fatigued and heartless we went to the office of the Daily, and desired him to publish a short notice of our arrival, in his paper. Having done this we returned to the tavern, changed our clothes, took some refreshment, and sallied forth again, with a determination to search every street and alley in the city; and should we prove unsuccessful, we designed to visit the city of Boston, and enquire of Mrs. Jones, as probably they had kept up a correspondence with her. We walked through the city until it began to grow late, and were seized with despair; yet still we continued to examine every place and enquire of every one we met. We turned into an alley, which we agreed should be the last for that evening, and resolved to await the result of the advertisement for the rest. We walked on, very slow, sometimes enquiring, and often passing the houses without speaking. When we were about half way through the alley Wilson happened to say that “Mrs. Cary must have left Philadelphia.” At that moment we heard foot-steps behind us, and female voices. As the pavement was narrow, we stepped on one side, to give the ladies room to pass, just as Wilson was speaking. The females (there were two,) appeared to examine us closely as they passed, and finally stopped. “Did we understand you, sir?” said one of them, “I thought you mentioned Mrs. Cary.” Heavens, it was Mary!! “Mr. Wilson,” said she.—He caught her in his arms in an instant, where I must leave them. I addressed the lady, in the meantime, and enquired for Mrs. Cary, telling her at the same time, of our arduous search. Finding that my sister paid no attention to me, I said “Mary does not know her brother—then lovers eyes are quick.” “Are you Mary's brother, sir?” asked the lady. “I am, madam.” “Mary, don't you see your brother?” Mary broke from Wilson and caught me round the neck, as I bent forward to salute her, and almost stifled me with kisses! She wept, she laughed, she acted ridiculous. “Yes Martha, this is my dear long lost brother.” “Miss Martha, shew us to your house, I long to see your mother, and Mary seems to have lost her senses: I am fatigued and wish to rest.” “Ah, sir,” she replied, “our house is not fit for you to go into.” “I don't value the fitness—it's not the house I wish to see, it is your mother.” “Oh, brother,” said Mary, “you cannot go in, it is an old dark room up stairs; and the steps leading to it are rotten, they would not bear your weight.” “I will go,” I replied, angrily, “show me the way Mary, do not be foolish.” When they found I was determined to go they set forward.—Wilson supported Mary, and I led Martha, or rather she led me. The house was close by, in Strawberry Alley; I shall remember Strawberry Alley as long I live. After walking a few steps they turned an angle into a short lane, alley, or something, being very narrow, giving scarcely room enough for two persons to walk abreast, and at about ten paces distant we came to the house, in fact we came to it at the angle, it being the corner house, a large and handsome one once no doubt, but then it was tumbling down. I felt the cold chills run over me at the sight, but was silent. I found the girls had not exaggerated when I came to ascend the decayed stair-case, which in many places was broken into holes, and so dark that it was really dangerous. It led up the back part of the house into a gloomy looking parlour, or whatever it might be called; but I never should have succeded, if Martha had not led me by the hand and pointed out the places of danger. Mary acted the same friendly part towards Wilson, and we at length effected our landing, into a place little better than the Spanish dungeon; all the difference was, one was above and the other under ground. Martha led me to her mother, a middle-aged pale faced female, and told her who I was. She shrieked for joy, while I took her by the hand, and kissed the cheek which she presented—the scene that followed can be better imagined than described; besides, to repeat what each one said would take up too much time and lead me too far from the main story. Martha had given me to understand, briefly, as we walked along, that they had occupied their present dwelling only a few days, that in consequence of not being able (from sickness and other misfortunes) to pay the rent of their former dwelling, they were turned out of it, and every thing they had that was worth taking, was taken to pay the rent! The sight of the wretched apartment, almost destitute of furniture, pierced me to the heart; besides Mrs. Cary and the two girls, it contained another female, who showed great confusion at being taken by surprise—it was evident she expected no such visitors. “I told you,” said Martha, “what a house you would see.” “You shall not be in it long, madam.—And your sufferings madam, (addressing Mrs. Cary) are over, I hope; compose yourself and be happy.” “Here Peggy,” said I, handing the girl some money. “Betsey, sir, is my name.” “Then go, Betsey, and bring me a couple of bottles champaign,” and turning to Mary, I told her in a low voice “that she must, with the other ladies, get ready to leave the place that evening.—I was going out to prepare 15 lodgings for them, by which time they must be ready.” In the meantime the girl returned with the wine, only two wine glasses could be found, one of these was cracked and the other had a piece broken out of the top. “You have seen hard times here Betsey,” said I, as I poured out the wine. “Yes indeed sir, that we have.” I waited on Mrs. Cary with the first glass, in which I joined her; I then waited on Martha, pledging her also—” “Let you alone Burlington, and I believe in my heart you will drink all the wine yourself.—We, I suppose, must wait until our betters are served,” said Wilson, handing Mary up to the table. I was in the right humour for mischief, and asked him “if he we would not rather lead her up to the parson?” This was answered no other way than by a look of gentle reproof from both. Mrs. Cary smiled, Martha sighed, and Betsey simpered. When he and Mary had finished their glass—“Come Betsey, said I, “it is long since you and I joined in the pleasure of taking a glass of wine together.” She declined until Mrs. Cary spoke to her. “Why, confound the fellow,” said Wilson, is he going to take the advantage of us so, ladies.” I cut him short, telling him we would walk. He however resolved to be within one of me, and helped himself to another glass, “the better” he said, “to keep his balance in descending the stairs.” “I hoped you would spend the evening with us,” said Mrs. Cary, sorrowfully. “Yes, madam, I will spend the evening with you: it would be something very extraordinary indeed that could tempt me not to do so; but I am going to provide a more suitable place than this, to spend it with you. I then called Mary aside and told her to leave or give away their furniture, if they had any, that such as I saw was not worth moving.—And taking my hat, called Wilson to walk saying to the ladies, we would not take leave as we should soon return, and charging them “not to get tipsy,” we sought our way down the old stairs. We enquired for the nearest and best house of entertainment. This being pointed out to us, we desired the landlord “to prepare supper for six persons, and lodgings for the same number, three chambers, a parlour, and dining-room.” I directed him “to get the best supper Philadelphia could afford, and have all ready as quick as possible.” I could not forbear smiling to see the bustle and tumult produced by this notice—the servants running against each other, overturning chairs, tables, cats, dogs, and every thing that came in their way. “Get out of the way,” says one. “Take care,” says another. “Have coffe, tea, and chocolate,” says the landlord to the cook.—“Sweep them rooms quick, and dust the furniture.” I dare say they expected at least two foreign Ambassadors and their suites. My next step was to order three carriages to Strawberry Alley, which had probably never been so highly honoured before. The sight of three splendid carriages, in a huddle, excited even more curiosity than the orders of the Mansion-house, where I engaged supper. The exclamations of the passengers were amusing— “What's to pay here?” “Who's dead? who's dead?” Upon my return I asked the ladies if they were ready.—“Soon would be, they had only to dress.” “That is the last thing I should have thought of, but I believe it is the first thing with women—perhaps in the present instance it was well enough, as they were to figure away as lady embassadresses. We intimated to them not to hurry their toilet, as it would be sometime before supper would be ready, and they retired into a small chamber to dress. In the meantime a little ragged girl came in, where Wilson and I were sitting, and hoisted off old pots, pans, and such things, which I suspected Mrs. Cary had given her. “Will you drink some wine, my pretty little girl?” “Yes sir,” said she. “Where is your mama?” “At home sir.” “Take your things home and tell your mama to come here.” “Here,” said Wilson, “buy yourself a coat with this,” handing her a dollar. “Thank you, sir.” Poor thing, she had great need of one; she received the money with a smile, and ran home with great speed, holding her pans on her head with the same hand in which she held the money, and grasped the rent in her petticoat as well as she could, with the other. In a short time she and her mother both came—she was a young and handsome looking woman. I asked her to be seated, and gave her some wine, telling her “we were going away, and should not want it.” She was a widow, it appeared, with four children, and being distinguished by our friends, Wilson and I both, gave her a trifle. The ladies now appeared; I gave Mrs. Cary my arm, and led the way down the “dangerous steep,” leaving my friend to take charge of the young ladies and follow after. When they were all landed at the bottom, I helped Betsey (who took charge of the baggage) into her carriage first, being determined to cut a dash—our females looked respectable, and might pass better than us. I laughed at Wilson, telling him “he looked very shabby to play off the ambassador,” and asked him why he “didn't put on his new dun-coloured coat? You will not do for the principal,” said I: “you will have to act the secretary.” Presenting my hand to Martha, after helping Mrs. Cary into her carriage, I told her she must ride with me, “that probably Mary had some tender things to say to Wilson.” Poor Mary, she loved me too well, to scold me for this, and it is quite likely that she loved the idea it conveyed much better—I should think so. “Begging your Excellency's pardon, I am of opinion your conduct presents stronger evidence of a desire to say tender things, than mine.” Whether or not he availed himself of this opportunity to breathe a tender sigh in the ear of his mistress, I have never understood. We soon arrived at our lodgings, the landlord leading way to our destined parlour—he informed us supper would be ready in twenty-five minutes, and the interval was spent in that sort of conversation which was most likely to dispel all recollection of the past, and create a lively anticipation of the future. When supper was announced I led Mrs. Cary to the head of the table. I entreated her to take that seat, and consider herself at home, until one more agreeable to her could be provided, and “that in every respect she was to consider herself mistress of this temporary establishment.” Taking Mary's hand, I led her to the next seat on Mrs. Cary's right—Wilson of course took the opposite one. I led Martha to the seat opposite Wilson, taking my place opposite to her, and next to my sister, telling the servant who waited, to withdraw, that Betsey (who had just appeared) was all the attendant we desired. Let the miser take pleasure in contemplating his secreted treasure, let the monarch take pleasure in beholding his willing subjects at his feet, let the hero take pleasure in that just applause which is due to his valour, and greater still, let let the patriot take pleasure in those immortal honours heaped upon him by his country—but I would not have exchanged the pleasure I felt on taking my seat this night at supper, for all of them. If there be real happiness on earth, it consists in that pleasure which results from a sense of gratitude due to a benefactor. Wilson was happy—we will suppose that he was—yet —his happiness was terrestrial—mine was celestial—To relieve the indigent, to console the distressed, to cherish the widow, the orphan, and to protect the friendless, has something in it very far removed from earth. Our Saviour says, “in as much as ye have done it unto one of these, ye have done it unto me.” So far as I had been the instrument of contributing to the happiness of this family, so far I certainly did feel all the pleasure of which it was susceptible. But I was 15* not happy! this may seem strange, and yet it is most true. What then, blessed as I was, with so many amicable friends, my fortune about to be restored to me, my sister soon to be united to the most worthy of his sex, my uncle fulfilling the place of a father.—I felt all the affection for him of a son, and still not happy! Why is this? it proves, if I am not mistaken, that complete happiness is not to be found in this world. The reader has set me down, to fall in love with Miss Martha.—No, all lovely as she is, I love her indeed, but it is the love of a brother for a sister—then it must be Leanora!—not— that—either—though it was something very much like it —I esteemed Leanora, I adored her, and would have loved her, if it were not vain. But had it even been the case it would have yielded to reason, it would have yielded to necessity, it would have been guided by that strength of mind which had sustained such a variety of vicissitudes; but the thought, the impossibility, of my having it in my power to requite the generosity of Leanora poisoned all my joys. Thousands of miles separated us—not even the shadow of hope that we should ever meet again, affected me so deeply as to betray my feelings to this happy company. Mrs. Cary first observed it, and Wilson threw out some sprightly sallies, which, though very delicate, insinuated as much as though Martha had entangled me in her chains; but he never was more mistaken in his lfe. True I esteemed Martha, and hope I ever shall; but to forget Leanora was to have ceased to live. Had I done so, I must have been the blackest of villains! no, never, never, Leanora will I forget thee. Observing that the party imbibed my depression of spirits, I shook it off, and assuming a gayer countenance I told my sister, “I had good news to tell her.” “What is it?” “You have an uncle in New-York, I suspect, by this time.” “An uncle, brother: what uncle?” “Thomas, your father's brother.” “No, I do not recollect him.” “Don't you remember to hear your father talk of a brother who went to sea when a youth.” “Yes, he died, did we not hear—” “That report was erroneous; he is alive and well.” I then informed her that we parted in Havanna; I was engaged by promise to meet him at New-York, where I must set out very shortly.” She hinted, though in a very distant manner, that she would be glad to know “what accident had detained me so much longer than I intended, from coming to see her.” I gave her to understand that it was too long a story for me to begin that night, and that I should leave Wilson with them, and he could relate it at his leisure. “And are you going to leave us so soon, brother?” “I must go Mary, but I shall soon return, and bring my uncle with me; he says he will dance the first reel at a certain young lady's wedding.” Mary and Wilson both blushed; after swallowing with much difficulty, what tea was in her saucer, which she had raised to her face to hide her confusion. Mary wondered “what young lady it could be.” “Oh, for heaven's sake,” said Wilson, “you are too bad Burlington, let's talk about something else.” I told him “not to be taking hints that perhaps were not intended for him—he would induce people to believe he was a party concerned.” After enjoying their embarrassment awhile, I changed the subject by enquiring “whether they had heard from Dupon since he left the United States?” “—They had not.” At the name of Dupon, Martha who as I before observed, sat opposite to me, threw her eyes downward and changed colour. “I am unfortunate,” thought I, and changed the subject again, by enquiring “what had become of Hunter?” He had broke jail and was not heard of since. By this time supper was concluded, and after chatting an hour or so with the ladies, not overlooking the faithful Betty, Wilson and I retired to sleep (or intending to do so) in the same room as usual. It had been agreed upon that Wilson and my sister should be united as soon as they met, but the circumstance of our meeting with my uncle was a sufficient reason for postponing the nuptials until he could be present, which I had gently intimated to her at supper. Whether this delay gave Mary any unpleasant feelings or otherwise I could not ascertain, but certain it is that Wilson submitted with great reluctance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. When we retired to our chamber he asked me “if I was serious in my conversation at supper, as it respected the delay of his marriage until the arrival of my uncle— why this arrangement was made, and why he was kept in ignorance of it?” Wilson was, at any time, irritable when he supposed his honour assailed, and on the present occasion perhaps the impatience arising from disappointment, excited those nice feelings to a higher degree than ordinary. I informed him that no arrangement had been made, or most assuredly he would have been the first person consulted, that the uncertainty of my sister's fate had not permitted me even to think of the subject until that moment in which I jested with her at supper. I then suggested the propriety of postponment until my uncle would arrive, “that it would be almost an insult to him to treat him with so little respect—true, said I, years have long since elapsed when you were to have been united, and as all three are bound under the most solemn engagements, I would be the last to infringe an obligation so sacred; but the thing was so reasonable in itself, and so much the desire of all parties, except himself, who was little better than crazy, that I hoped he would consent to wait, that it would not be more than three or four weeks at most; that I should leave him to take care of the ladies, and in the meantime he could indemnify himself, measurably, by sundry tender things which he understood better than I could tell him. Finally, I besought him to gratify me for once, as the sacrifice would be productive of general satisfaction to so many deserving people.” After a great number of Oh, Lords, Oh, heavens and earth, and other interjectons, Wilson said “he supposed then he must wait another age, that he had served already as long as Jacob did for his wives.” Next morning upon entering the parlour, we found the ladies, who had been up sometime. They were all well and in fine spirits except Martha, and in spite of her efforts at gaiety her countenance was overcast with melancholy. I took a seat by her (it is needless to say any thing about Wilson, as every one can guess how he disposed of himself, but I rather think he'll tell his beloved a doleful tale of “protracted bliss, pains, and darts, and aching hearts,”) and entered into conversation with her. This amiable girl, who had endeared herself to me by her humane attention to my friendless sister, independent of her transcendant charms, was the counterpart of her mother. She was in height rather above the middle size, her figure symmetry itself, her hair and eyes were black, her skin rather fair than otherwise, her face oval, teeth as white as ivory, but her chief beauty was her modesty, she had the most diffident countenance I ever beheld, and her voice was magic, soft, and melodious. I never recollect seeing a female who was remarkably modest that had not a soft sweet voice; they are invariably united. A bold female has on the contrary a loud coarse voice. “Miss Cary, (said I,) I esteem this occasion amongst the happiest of my life, to have it in my power to acknowledge my obligations to you, and to assure you of the deep sense I have of your goodness. “Martha, nothing short of heaven can repay goodness like yours, and that of your matchless mother.— But at the same time it yields me inexpressible pleasure to be able to discharge some part of the debt I owe you; that I have it in my power to call myself your friend and your protector. “Yes, Martha, while I live you shall never want either.” “Oh, sir, you are too good,” said she, “you overrate me beyond, far beyond, what I deserve.” “No madam, indeed I do not; but it is you that would underrate yourself.” Mrs. Cary had retired to her chamber, Wilson and Mary were sitting at some distance, too much engaged to observe us—I took her hand, “Martha, said I, “all is not well with you; it is with much pain I discern that something preys upon your spirits. “My dear girl honour me with your confidence; repose your sorrow in my breast, and in me you will ever find the inviolate friend, the tender brother—fear not to trust me.” This was too much for her sensibility; she burst into tears: no one saw them but myself—precious drops! the unsullied effusion of friendship, constancy, and love. I drew out my handkerchief and wiped them away. I arose, still holding her hand, and led her to her chamber, where she could indulge her feelings without restraint. Seating myself by her side in silence, and leaning my head on my other hand I gave way—shall I say, then I was very near if not altogether in the same situation with Martha, that is I had not the power of speech. I thought however, that Martha was more prodigal of her tears as they fell in copious drops upon my hand, which lay carelessly on her lap with hers still grasped in it. As I sat in the manner just described, I was roused on a sudden by a deep sigh from Martha, immediately followed by a shivering. Seeing a cloth shawl on the bed, I got up and wraped it round her, resuming my seat by her side again. After wiping the tears from her cheeks, (and my own too Martha, said I, “confide in my honour—trust me for once—tell me the cause of your distress, it will relieve your heart and confer a treasure on me.—I thought last night, but I may be mistaken, that—but—my dear girl I do not wish to urge my confidence—but tell me am I right—Dupon.”—“We are engaged,” said Martha, fetching a sigh that seemed to contain her soul—“Be composed Martha, he will come, he never can forsake worth like yours—no—he never can, it is impossible.” “I am going to New-York, perhaps to-morrow, I shall hear of him.” I shall make it my business, if he is on the face of the globe.” Be assured I shall find him.” “Oh Mr. Burlington you are too, too generous,—Dupon,—I fear, ah I dare not say it.” Dead you mean Martha, then it is vain to grieve for him, the same if he is false—But how long has it.”—“Six months, if no accident—eight at the most—I can not think, Burlington, I can not believe Dupon is false, if you knew him you would be of my opinion.” “I know not what to think of it,” said I, “I know from sad experience one thing, that our actions are controlled by destiny, and that accidents happen to all,” it may be the case with Dupon. Take my advice therefore Martha, and be happy, content your self a little longer; amuse yourself until I return, I beg of you for my sake, to rest assured that if he is on earth I will find him. I will first attend my uncle here, to the marriage of my sister, and then I shall devote one year at least to your happiness.” She had ceased shivering, but continued cold, I proposed going to the parlour fire, but she declined, saying that I must make her excuse at breakfast.” I called Betsey, and desired her to bring Martha a cup of hot coffee, and send some one to make a better fire in the chamber. I had some apprehension that the shivering would be followed by a fever, but I now discovered it was nothing but a hysteric fit. When Betty brought the coffee, I took it from her and told her to go and hasten the word, telling Martha with a smile, as I cooled her coffee, “that should a certain gentleman happen to step in, he might be tempted to be jealous. This set her to laughing, which brought Wilson and Mary to the door, and in the same instant breakfast was announced. I arose to attend the summons taking Wilson away, and saying to Martha, I would send her breakfast to her chamber. I suspect it would have been difficult without knowing the truth, to have persuaded Wilson that I was any thing but Martha's humble swain. Mrs. Cary asked if her daughter was ill. I told her she was not, and taking her hand, led her to the eating room. Mary soon joined us, a look enterchanged between her and Mrs. Cary, explained that nothing of consequence was the matter, and the old lady eat her breakfast quite cheerful after sending her daughter at my request to her chamber. For myself I was far from being cheerful, the distress of this unhappy young woman pierced me to the soul. O heavens! if she suffers thus thought I, in her present situation, what must she have indured, when thrown friendless and indigent on a cruel world. Great God! the thought, even the thought is insupportable.” A man if he be overtaken by misfortunes, stands a double chance of relief. If he fails with his own sex, (which is seldom the case) he is sure almost to succeed with the other; but a poor friendless woman has none, and more O heavens! if she be possessed of personal advantages. She is then the never failing victim of her own sex, and sorry am I to say it, too often of ours. Solomon said he had not found one good woman among ten thousand, when he was upon earth; God only knows how many he would find were he here now. I do suspect it was no easy matter for a woman to impose herself upon a man of Solomon's wisdom. After breakfast I called Mary, and bid her see Martha and propose for a little walk; that I wished to attend them to the shops before I set out, so that they might have time to get their finery made for the wedding, before I returned. Perhaps many of my female readers will expect Mary's reply. I therefore beg to remind them that I have on all occasions avoided such things in the course of this narrative, not because I was ignorant of them, for it may well be supposed I was not, but because I denounce such nauseous stuff as unworthy of consideration, and highly pernicious to my fair readers in particular. But marriage is an honourable thing — True, but it some times happens that courtships are not quite so. I have always been of opinion that those tender things that pass between two ingenuous lovers are only valuable in proportion as they are kept inviolate from the world. Wilson was my bosom friend, Mary was my sister, in the course of their long and ardent affection, I heard and saw enough to have filled ten such volumes as this. But to be telling what he said, and what she said, and what he said again, would be a jargon of nonsense unworthy 16 the perusal of rational readers, and permit me to observe once for all, that it is solely for the sake of my fair readers, that I have excluded this fulsome stuff from these memoirs. Without my aid they will (or at least many of them will) learn those things perhaps too soon, and repent too late. But to return: The ladies were equipped for walking, and had taken their seats by the parlour fire, until Wilson was ready, who forsooth must shave and dress before he could venture to appear, in the character of a gallant. In the mean time, I took out my pocket book, and threw a hundred dollars into each of the ladies' laps, nor did I forget my friend Betty Watson, as I had learned that was her name. This faithful and deserving young woman was intitled to this mark of my respect on a double account. Although there was little prospect of Mrs. Cary's situation being such as to indemnify her for the sacrifice she made in sharing her precarious fortune, yet she never once showed the least disposition to leave her; gold, therefore was a poor reward for fidelity like hers; I had none about me, but I told her she should have it so soon as Wilson came out of his chamber. I then sat down by Martha, who had pulled her bunnet over her eyes, which were red with weeping, and taking hold of the notes which she held in her hand. I asked if that was sufficient to equip her as brides-maid. Before she had time to answer Wilson entered quite irresistable. I desired him to give me ten eagles, which I handed to Betty telling her not to consider that, or any part of it as imbracing wages, that it was merely a present, the reward of her fidelity to Mrs. Cary, and that she should have her wages besides. She was about to overwhelm me with thanks when Mary interrupted by exclaiming, “now I am jealous of you Betsey— Brother has put us off with paper, and given you gold.” I cut their dispute short by telling them we would walk, calling Betsey to come along too, that she should have fine clothes as well as the rest. She ran for her bonnet— we waited till she returned and all six then set out. As we walked along, I requested Wilson, the first thing he did, after we returned, to seek another girl to attend on the ladies, that Betsey had waited on them long enough, she ought to have a little rest; besides, she has her clothes to make, and would be wanting to help the ladies prepare for the wedding. I dare say Betsey heard every word, for she was walking by my side, as I could by no means suffer her who was no longer to be considered in the light of a servant to walk behind. I had learned from Mary, that Betsey Watson had been brought up by Mrs. Cary; that she was much attached to her, and was a virtuous well informed girl, I therefore resolved to extend my protection to her, so long as she chose to live with Mrs. Cary. While the ladies were engaged in selecting such things as they wanted, Wilson and myself strayed about the doors of the respective shops, lest our presence might embarrass Mary, in the choice of the sacred robe. At length we were called to attend them, when I observed that Mrs. Cary had considerable change left, as she was stuffing it in her ridicule.—“Stop, stop, my dear madam, that won't do said I, you must not stint yourself in this manner, you have need of all this I know, lay every cent of it out, don't be afraid dear mother,—should you want a little change while I am gone call on Wilson.” “Oh sir, said she, indeed you are—I cannot think of imposing on you.” “No words at all madam if you please,” said I, leading her back to the counter. She took a pile of fine linen, and a few other little things. They loaded Wilson and myself, and had a small parcel apiece themselves. When we arrived at home, “well Betsey, said I, let me see what pretty things you have.” “Oh dear me sir, I have so many things I don't know what I shall do, I am afraid it will make me too proud”— “combs, crapes, shawls, silk dress, cambrics, &amp;c. &amp;c.” “What's this for Betsey?” (taking hold of a piece of fine linen,) “a dress too?” “Oh dear me sir, I can't tell you what any of 'um is, for I am crazy with joy.” “Tell him to mind his own business,” said Mary, “and take them away from him, don't let him be tumbling your things about so.” “Oh, Mrs. Touchy and I'll see what you have,” (seizing hold of her bundle,) she siezed it at the same instant, I pulled, and she pulled, after I made Martha laugh, I let her take it without looking at any thing. I would not have done so had she been willing. Wilson was gone to hunt a servant, Mary and Martha retired to put a way their things, Mrs. Cary was gone upon the same business, I called Betsey to me and giving her some change, requested her to “go and purchase some cakes, sweet meats, pine-apples and some good pippins, in short every thing you see, that's good Betsey, I shall leave you to-morrow, and I intend to feast all this day.—If you'll be a good girl, I'll when I come from New-York bring you a sweet heart. I thought Jinkins would make her an excellent match, and she was so fine a girl that I wished to see her provided for. She blushed, and ran off to the landlord to procure a basket. When she left me, it came into my head, to steal upon the girls and have some more fun with Mary, as she no doubt was engaged in arranging the wedding materials, the door was standing ajar, I stepped along on tiptoe, when arrived at the door I stoped and listened. “Oh now don't this trimming look lovely? won't it look elegant by candle light?” said Mary, “my shoes, I am sorry they are too small, I'll have to get Betsey to go and change them, I was in such a hurry lest brother and Mr. Wilson should see me.” “That was a pitty,” said I, bolting into the chamber. Mary shrieked and gathered up her things, which were spread over the bed. Martha laughed heartily “I declare now brother, you are too bad, said Mary.” “Where is that trimming that will look so well by candle light? I want to see how it looks by day light.” she began to push me out of the room, as Mrs. Cary who had heard the uproar, came to see what was the matter, She cautioned the girls to be more careful in future. I declared they should not engage in any sort of business that day, that they should keep me company, as it was the last day I should spend with them for some time, and led them to the parlour.—Just as we were seated, Wilson and Betsey Watson made their appearance, the former saying he had procured a servant, she would be there in the evening, whilst the latter brought me the basket saying she had obeyed as near as possible, and there was the change. “Keep it Betsey, (said I) to purchase more when these are gone.” “What good things are these you have here brother?” said Mary looking in the basket. “Go away (replied I) you would'nt let me see your fine things, you saucy baggage, you shall not see mine, clear out, you shall not touch a thing till Mrs. Cary has her choice,” as she was attempting to out squabble me in retaining a pine-apple, which she had laid hold of. Wilson came next, I arose with them both hanging upon me, and going to a table dislodged the contents of the basket on it, telling the ladies that “that was terrapin alamode,” called Mrs. Cary to come and take her choice. “Indeed,” said the charming woman, “Mr. Burlington you will spoil us all.” She began to understand my nature too well to add any more, and she was too refined.—In short we added wine and porter, and spent the day, in eating and drinking, laughing and talking. Martha became quite cheerful. Betsey skiped about like a fawn, Mrs. Cary discharged the duties of her new station with dignity and grace, and I acquiesced in the general joy. Wilson and Mary looked pleasant and tranquil, except when my evil stars would put it into my head to enquire whether she had exchanged those shoes yet, on these occasions, I would receive a look from Mary, which I could not refuse to understand. Toward evening I directed the landlord to procure us some music, it having been agreed upon that the ladies, and Wilson were to sit up till 12 o'clock, that being the hour of my departure for New-York. The music came, 12 o'clock came, and the parting scene came. 16* When the clock struck, Mary began to weep. Wilson turned pale, Mrs. Cary looked sorrowful, and the pensive Martha sighed, bestowing on me a look the most earnest, the most winning I ever beheld. “I shall not forget you Martha,” said I, taking leave of her first, be happy dear girl till I see you again. I next took Mrs. Cary by the hand. Betsey presented herself next, she held out her hand, but I extended my adieu a little farther and snatched a kiss. Mary was sobbing on Wilson's bosom, she jumped up however, when he told her I was waiting, and seized me round the neck, she held me so long and so tenaciously, that Wilson had to take her forcibly away. I pressed his hand without speaking, and departed leaving them all in tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. When I arrived at New-York, I hastened to the place appointed to enquire for my uncle, which was the City Hotel, and to my infinate joy, the first person I saw was Sambo, “Ah old fellow, said I, how do you do, how is your Master?” “Oh Massa,” said he, shaking my hand and pulling off his hat, “how you do, how you do. Massa in a chamber, he talk'bout you all a time, he be so glad.” “How long have you been here Sambo?” said I, as he conducted me to his master. “We jes here day fo yessaday, Massa he cus, he cus, all de way, d—n de gup steam, de ba what ebe he call. Massa been sick too.” “My uncle sick, not now is he?” as we entered his room. The meeting was joyful enough on both sides. I enquired whether he had been long or dangerously ill. “Oh yes, I have been very sick child. I once thought I should never see thee again.” “Sambo get some refreshments.” “I had telled Jinkins to write down what I wanted thee to do, and all that, but thank God he has let me see thee once more.” “Where is Jinkins?” said I. “Don't know.” Sambo answered, “he was gone to see Hunter.” “Yes, O he'll soon be here, he never stays long from me, but where be Hal?” “He did not come sir, I left him to take care of my sister and two otherladies, who had afforded her relief when she was in distress,” and briefly related to him the situation in which I found them. “Then thee hast been to Boston.” “No sir, they are in Philadelphia. When I arrived in Tennessee, I found two letters from my sister, informing me of her distress, and her departure from Boston, and that they were now happily situated, and all well when I left them, that Wilson and Mary promised themselves the pleasure of seeing him return with me to honour their nuptials.” “Thee did right, child, but I must fix thy business with Hunter, first thing—he tells me he's lost his pocket book and some o' his little bits o' papers, and receipts, and such things—I doubt his honesty my son, a sort a quivecates a little.” “I have his pocket book,” said I, telling my uncle how I became possessed of it. “I have brought it with me, but what is in it, I know no more than you do, for I have been so hurried from place to place, that I have never examined it; but it must be his, as his name is on the outside.” “Well, tell ye what thou do child, just write a little line or two to Boston—will soon get an answer, and in the meantime we'll see what he has here, and get thy own out o' him, and we'll just tell him, d'ye see, to clear himself to the farthest end o' the world. “Aye, we'll not be hanging up a poor d—l that's not worth the halter that's round his neck—'told Jinkins and Sambo to not be talkin' about 'um at all—Oh, they're as true as steel.” I approved of this humane design of my uncle indeed, though I had nearly fallen a sacrifice to the villainy of this man, yet I felt not the least desire of revenge. I then directed Sambo to furnish me with pen, ink, and paper, and wrote to Mr. L— of Boston, who was the person pointed out by Hunter to my uncle, as being qualified to give correct information on the subject of his property. “His word will pass,” said my uncle, “as current as gold—I been asking my old friend B— about um, he was here to see me just a little afore you come—he lives in Chatham-street.—Oh, yes, he says I can depend —was just going to get him to write this very evening if thee hadn't a come.” I finished the letter and sent it by the landlord to the post-office, and in a few minutes Jinkins made his appearance. He was overjoyed to meet me, and saluted with much cordiality.—He enquired very particularly after Wilson and my sister. As I finished the answer to his questions I thought of my promise to Martha, and begged leave of the company to retire. I flew to the post-office and addressed a second letter to Mr. L— begging him to enquire of Mr. P— of Boston, whether he had heard lately of Dupon, and what had become of him. Martha had found an opportunity during the last evening I spent with her, to slip a memorandum into my hand, informing whom and where to address my enquiries. As the mail was still unclosed, I addressed another letter to Mrs. Jones with my address. In this letter I informed her that I was the brother of Mary Burlington, that she was well and was shortly to be married, that Mrs. Cary and Martha were well, and in affluence. In the next place I begged to know when she had heard from Dupon, or whether at all—and finally what had become of the Simpsons—to write as quick as possible, —that shortly I would leave New-York for Philadelphia. Having finished my letters I returned to my uncle's room. I observed to him, after supper we would look over Hunter's papers and see what they were. “Very well, thee and Jinkins can do that; but thee didn't tell me when Mary was going to be married, hang it;—it was a plaguey unlucky thing that I should have been sick—it's wasted me mightily—I was nation fraid that thee'd not get thine own out o' Hunter; but as to that, I would a left thee and that there sly fellow that lets on, he's so saintish, that's going to be married to Mary, I'd a divided it all between thee and him Jinkins. Faith, Jinkins wouldn't that I should a died to a had the whole world—would'st?” “I would not sir, for ten thousand such worlds,” replied Jinkins. “Believe what thee sayest? do think of it—hadn't a been for him I should a slipped cable;—nation nigh as it was. “But—(getting up and stepping across the floor) begin to feel pretty stout again. I must be at the wedding, wouldn't miss it for a deal—Oh, if I don't plague that Sly Boots.—Mary, most forget her, don't think she could be born when I left Boston, couldn't a been more than a babe. “Thee I remember as well 'twas yesterday, used to have fights and quarrels about riding in the shayze wi' me.—Ah, many a time thee clinched thy teeth in me for breaking up thy nut-cracking, when by chance I'd whip up a handful and run away—Ah, well, who would ha' thought o' thee?” He called Sambo to light his pipe—I told him he had learned to smoke since I saw him; I had never seen him with a pipe before. “Yes, I always smoked a little, but thee never noticed it.” In the course of half an hour, we were told supper was ready, the good old man had ordered supper for us three in a private room, that we might enjoy ourselves without restraint. When supper was over we returned to our chamber, and Jinkins and I had smoked a segar, and my uncle his pipe, I produced Hunter's pocket-book. Upon examining his papers we found several bonds of considerable amount, some valuable receipts, and a few old letters, which I could not decipher, being written in secret characters, and evidently appeared to have been a correspondence between him and the pirates, the oldest date was as early as 1795, the latest two years!—Shocking to think how human nature is debased—what sort of a soul can that man possess who can in cool blood, spill that of a fellow man, and take all he has—and yet this wretch, this Hunter, at the time he was aiding, abetting, and no doubt perpetrating those crimes, crimes of the blaskest die, was no doubt esteemed a respectable member of society, caressed and admired; whilst such a woman as Mrs. Cary was thrown an outcast from society. Wretched infatuation! that wealth should be attended with such accursed consequences; let those who possess it fear, and tremble!—Whilst these reflections were passing through my mind, some one knocked at the door, which Sambo (who had taken a seat in the corner) opened, and who should appear but Horton. I could not like this fellow, although he had been the means of saving of my life—his ill looks, his avowed baseness, and his treachery to my father—I never could view him without horror. I was sorry when I saw him that I had not in the course of the evening's conversation ascertained my uncle's pleasure respecting him; he certainly ought to be acquitted, so far as he was concerned with the pirates, as he had turned king's evidence, but whether he ought in the case of his theft in stealing the bonds out of my father's desk, admitted of some question; besides, he had spent his whole life in the employment of Hunter, and was now to be thrown on the world without a penny; this would never do, he might from necessity be tempted to resume his piratical practices—but what was to be done, I left to time and my uncle to decide. “Well, Horton,” said I, “we have met once more— how do you come on? what do you intend to do? as we are all arranging our situations for life, and you have acted a conspicuous part amongst us, I have some curiosity to know what you intend to do with yourself.” “Take a chair,” said my udcle to him, “and answer my nevy, he knows more about them things than I do.” “I have acted a very bad part, sir, indeed—I have acted so that I have nothing for my labour.” “This is what you ought to have expected; and you may think yourself well situated, when compared to that of your employer.” “I do not murmur,” said he, “I throw myself on your mercy, and that of your—no—nob—le—uncle,” bursting into tears—“I deserve ten thousand deaths, I plead guilty.” Horton was really sincere in his repentance—he held his head down, supported by both hands, and sobbed like a child. “Oh, thee needn't be making such lamentations, child, no one is going to hurt thee—my nevy was just talking his own way, d'ye see, he's no notion o' hurting on thee, and if so be that thou'lt be an honest boy in time to come,—here's old Tom, he never forsook a comrade,— thee shall have sailors luck amongt us, so prithee don't be making a bother—take some brandy and hush thy womanish tears, and tell Charles there, about the papers— Sambo bring us some wine,” said my uncle, striving to hide the tear, that in spite of his efforts rolled down his cheek. Your heart is too tender (thought I) old man, for this iron world, as I asked Horton to look at Hunter's papers, and see what he could make of them. “Let him take a glass of wine, and that will brighten his ideas.” After Horton had drank, and wiped his eyes, he lookover the papers; but it was all Greek to him, he could make nothing of them. Some people will perhaps, suspect Horton's sincerity on this occasion; but I did not. Indeed the astonishment he evinced upon the discovery of the artifice practiced upon him by Hunter, was sufficient evidence with me, that this secret correspondence was the first intimation he had had of Hunter's real character.—He had always been led to think that he was the only and sole confident of Hunter.—No wonder he was astonished at the consummate duplicity exercised towards him by this man! It was evident that he (Horton,) was used as a tool, and must inevitably have been sacrificed in the end, and in all probability the time had arrived when he fortunately made his escape—He had been the bearer of all these letters written to the pirates, and yet was ignorant of this secret precaution, with which they were written! My uncle broke in upon us by telling Horton “that the upshot of the business was, that they had been two grand rogues together, only Hunter had most sense; and tell'e what friend, it's bad on both sides and thee's gained nothing but a bad name, see, so just quit it and betake thyself to an honest way o' life, and if Hunter can't give thee something to begin upon, we'll see to that, so just go about thy business and come to-morrow.” Horton burst into tears afresh! “What ails him? maybe poor d—l has nothing to buy him a supper, here take this,” said my uncle, (handing him his purse) “and get thee gone;—'wants to talk to my nevy.” “Thank you sir,” said Horton, refusing the purse— “I have enough for present demands, it's not on account of my poverty that I am distressed; but I have murdered my dear wife, I can hear of her nowhere, nor can I find any one who can tell what has become of her—she has certainly broke her heart, or perished for want, and my poor little children—I—had three—and left her pregnant with another. “Oh, God—I shall forever be miserable if I cannot find them—” He gave way for some time to his feelings without uttering a word.—At length he resumed— “Your generosity, noble sir, and that of your generous nephew, has quite unmanned me; and you are the only persons to whom I have disclosed this circumstance.” “Where didst leave her, and how long be it?” said my uncle. “Oh, sir, it is six years since I saw or heard from her. I left her in this city—I was seduced from her arms by a vile wretch, who haunted me night and day, and finally eloped from me, after stealing my gold watch and all my money. “In short she stripped me of every thing, even to my clothes.—My wife came to the lodgings I had hired for this wretch, and implored me with tears not to forsake her. “But villain that I was, I heeded not her tears, I was deaf to the voice of nature—I kicked her out of the house, and have never seen her since —I left the city the next day, taking the wretch with me—we sailed to Charleston, where she left me without a cent.” “Be composed,” said I: “Horton I will assist you in searching for your wife and children.” “Oh, sir, she cannot be alive; she would break her heart—but if I could know—if I could find my children—” 17 “Well, man, thee needn't be making such a fuss; thee is not the only one that's lost a wife and children.” Horton now took leave, without speaking a word. “Poor soul!” said my uncle, “he suffers for his bad doings.” I was afraid my uncle would relapse into one of his melancholy fits, and endeavoured to divert him from it by jocosely telling Jinkins “that I had a sweet-heart for him in Philadelphia.” “That is good news,” said he, “we'll have a double wedding, then, for I know nothing about the forms of courtship—she will therefore have to take me at a word, or not at all.” “That's cleverly said,” replied the old man, “and if I don't give thee a wedding that'll be talked on for twenty years to come— I wonder if thee hasn't got one for thyself?” “No sir, but I have one for you.” “Better, still.” “There is a beautiful widow there, about ten years younger than you are, that I think it will be difficult to resist, at least I found it so with myself, although I spent but one day in her company.” “Sambo,” said he, (wishing as I thought to avoid the subject) “pray thee go to that old hulk of a landlord, and tell him to send us an oyster or two, and a bit of good old Cheshire cheese, thea suppers o' fresh meats and stuffs—sets too fresh on my stomach, and the boys will take a bit too, them cursed broths and things, that they fed me upon when I was sick, be never going to put strength in tome, and wish, d'ye hear, Sam tell 'um come along and give us a song—a's jolly old soul. “But, as was saying, 'wants to be stout against the wedding—'me if I don't foot it away with the best of um —I'll dance the first reel with the widow,” stepping exultingly through the chamber. “Oh, yes,” said Jinkins “you'll play the old game, as you did once before. I suppose you'll be for hoisting more sail—more sail—all said, quick—and I had like to have fallen overboard in my haste to execute your orders.” He burst into laughter at this premonition of Jinkins. “Ah, thee art a sly dog, nobody minds thee; now if thee mind him he'll tell thee a thousand fibs—and 'tells um wi' such a face too, that nation a bit but it seems to be the truth. “As to the Algerin', who the d—l do'st think, would stand to wi' them, when we had neither men nor metal that would ha' shivered a sail—he'll never be done with that.” “Brag's a good dog,” said Jinkins, “I would'nt be at all surprised to find you shut up in a closet, on the night of the wedding, instead of dancing the first reel, with the widow.” The old gentleman made no reply to this, except by a loud laugh. Sambo entered, followed by the landlord, whose physiognomy bespoke just such a companion as suited my uncle's disposition and temper. “Well my old comrade just tell thee what it is, (lay them things on the table Sambo—let the boys take a bit when 'likes) tell'ee what friend, thee must give us a song—'told my nevy that thee could sing an excellent song.” I was tired enough to go to bed, but found it indispensable to humour my uncle—and here we have heavo, and old lang syne again—nor had he forgot that I could sing John Anderson my joe. The landlord was very lively and facetious—told us a number of humourous anecdotes, and Jinkins shone forth in his real character, displaying a fund of wit and pleasantry. I had almost overlooked this talent in him, on our first acquaintance, being but little in his company, and my mind far from being at ease, though I saw that my uncle reposed the utmost confidence in him—but I now discovered that he was the life and soul of his existence.— The good old man, all affection as he is, must necessarily fix on something; Jinkins was therefore well calculated to arrest it, and thrice worthy of the choice. We sat up till dawn—taking out my watch, I mildly observed to my uncle, “that he ought to retire, he would retard his perfect recovery by keeping late hours.” The landlord took the hint, and very politely took leave, saying he had business. After he left us we had no difficulty in persuading my uncle to retire to rest—I slept with him, Jinkins and Sambo reposing on pallets, in the same chamber.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. Next morning after breakfast, we all three walked to the bank to ascertain Hunter's claim in stock, and found it correct—also the real property preciseley as he stated. We returned to our lodgings after taking from the books a memorandum of the exact amount, dates, &amp;c. Our next business was to see Hunter and adjust so much of the business as was practicable that day: I wished to see if any thing would be left to remunerate Horton; neither was it my design to strip the creature of every thing—this would have been barbarous. I wished my uncle to be present, and Horton's presence might not be amiss. But he had not appeared, and I began to be alarmed on the account, lest the unhappy man might be tempted to commit some desperate act.— Hunter was yet in the ship, under guard, as he could not have been brought ashore without betraying his crimes, by securing him in jail. I resolved, therefore, to keep him where he was until our business was finally finished with him. Accordingly I procured an attorney, and Sambo a hack, to convey his master to the wharf, leaving instructions with the landlord to send Horton thither, should he call during our absence. I found Hunter with a long beard, his dress entirely neglected, and very much reduced in flesh. “Hunter,” said I, “how do you do?” giving him my hand. He seemed somewhat cheered by this friendly salutation: I told him that an attorney waited in the cabin with my uncle, to execute the conveyance of his property, that I wished to know if he was perfectly willing of his own accord, to transfer it—that it would not be valid without, and that he must shave and dress, whilst the lawyer was drawing up the writings, and go up to the 17* cabin. Sambo would assist him or help him to any thing he might want. “But,” said I, “Hunter, I wish you to understand me distinctly; I believe you own the property which you have stated to be yours—there is enough to pay the bonds, and likewise for so much of my father's property which was sacrificed for your debts, as well as his own: you understand that the sacrifice of his property, of his whole estate, and his consequent death, was owing to your agency, was it not? speak Hunter!” He seemed to hesitate— “Sir,” said I, “I have no more to do with you then, I shall go and dismiss the attorney.” He dreaded a prosecution, and was wise enough to know that I had it amply in my power to compel him to pay me. He knew therefore that on the one hand he might stand some chance to save his life, with the loss of his property, but on the other he stood little chance for either. “Hunter,” said I, “I want nothing from you but what is justly my own, and that I will have—so just say whether you are willing to acknowledge the claim, and willing to pay me in such a way as I have proposed?” He answered that he was. “Well sir,” said I, “I will go and request the lawyer to begin the writings.”—As I walked from him he begged me, after giving instructions to the lawyer to return, that he wished to speak to me—. “Very well, I shall return.” When I returned to Hunter, he was in the act of fixing himself up to appear above—“Well Hunter, here I am, what do you want?” “Oh, sir,” said he, “I have treated you and your family so ill, that I am ashamed to tell you; I deserve death, I acknowledge, but—” “You wish to know your own fate,” said I, finding that he hesitated. “If you will be so good sir—” “Hunter.” rejoined I, “taking your life cannot undo the past, and I presume your are not fit to die.—If I could have any assurance that you would reform, and quit your evil practices, I would gladly intercede for your life. “But what security could you give, that you would not resume your wickedness again? It is so prone in you, that I much doubt whether you could live out of the practice of that manner of life, in which you have hitherto lived. “It would be doing a great injury to society to allow you to escape—we would be answerable to our God, our country, and our consciences, for the lives you would take. “Your are a perfect ruffian, you are worse than wicked, you know not how to be merciful, how can you expect mercy, when you have shown none yourself?” I expressed myself in this manner to him, to observe whether it would produce any signs of repentance. He began to weep, but there was not that sincerity in his sorrow, that was evinced by Horton. I told him “that he had very different men to deal with from himself, and that his case would admit of no question, if they were not.” It actually began to be a question with me, whether I was doing right or not, to suffer Hunter to escape: but as the judges say, (if we have any doubts on our mind,) we ought to lean to the side of mercy. I then asked Hunter “what he was going to do with Horton? that he had kept him in his employ ever since he was able to do any thing, that he had corrupted his morals, and on that account he was as dangerous to the peace of society as he himself was, that he was now advanced in life, and destitute of support—what are you going to do for him?” He disliked, I saw very clearly, to answer this question. He at length stammered out “that if he had any thing left, Horton might take it.” “Then,” said I, “if you are pardoned what will you have, you are old now, and have nothing. Your ill gotten wealth has not throve with you. “But if I were sure that you would reform and behave yourself, I could venture to say, that either my uncle or myself would support you. “Your son, I suspect, is hung by this time—he broke jail in Boston, for using, or attempting to use. violence to my sister, and since my arrival in this city I have understood that he was taken up for passing counterfeit money.” The more I conversed with the wretch, the more I was prejudiced against him: I therefore pulled out his pocket-book and gave it to him, telling him where I found it, and how; that I had never had time to look at the papers until last evening; that they were all safe, I believed. He thanked me again, asked “if I knew in what part of the country his son was?” I answered I did not—that it made little odds where he was for all the good he was likely to do, as he was bent upon the gallows and no matter how soon he obtain his object. Upon going into the cabin I found Horton there and asked him if he had made any discovery respecting his wife. He shook his head sorrowfully and intimated that he had not. The conveyance of the shares in Bank Stock being finished, that respecting the two houses which Hunter owned in the city I objected to, on the ground that they ought to be valued—perhaps they might over-run the amount due: however, if they should, the attorney remarked “that as I intended to sell them I could return the overplus”—I was not so sure respecting that,—I should want a house for Mrs. Cary, and my uncle as he only came to the country upon trial and might chuse to reside in one of them. After hesitating some time, at length I resolved to consult Hunter, and my uncle desired him to be called. When he came and signed the conveyance for the stock. I asked him what he thought his real property was worth—that I did not wish it conveyed without being valued by himself or some other person, if I did not chuse to take it at his price. He replied “that he could not tell at this time what was the value, and the lawyer made out the conveyance, leaving a blank for the consideration. I paid him for his trouble and he departed. We remained but a short time behind him, to know of Hunter who he would prefer to value the property; he answered he had no choice—that any two respectable men might set a price on it. I observed that “I would rather he would name some of his friends, if he had any;” that as to my own part. I cared not much who valued it. He then mentioned a Mr. S—, and said I could chuse another myself. This being understood, we left him: my uncle returning to the hotel with Sambo, whilst I accompanied by Jinkins and Horton, set out to have the property valued. It was quite a show to see how Hunter and Horton eyed each other: two mastiffs, eager to attack each other, could not have looked more hostile. The sight filled me with horror. The property was valued at ninety six thousand dollars. This added to the shares, which was four thousand sixty-six each, made $112,264. I desired Horton to go and stay with my uncle until we should return, taking Jinkins with me as one of the witnesses to the conveyance. We were not long in the transaction. Hunter was well pleased with the valuation, and asked me “how much I conceived to be behind.” I gave him a memorandum of the amount of the whole I had received. The bonds he could calculate at his leisure, saying I was not determined whether I should exact interest or not for the debts my father paid of his—that I did not know the amount exactly, and I thought the best way would be just to lump it, and be done with it. True, half of the goods that were sacrificed were his, but that he had never paid for them, and my father's part was entirely sacrificed for that purpose, besides all his real property: that this was all his own doings and richly did he deserve to pay the utmost farthing. There was agreeably to the appraisement (which can only be referred to) ninety thousand dollars worth of goods, which sold for about forty, or forty-five thousand dollars. Two houses and lots worth fifty thousand dollars each at the lowest calculation, did not sell for more than half that sum. “I shall exact the value of these at the time when they were sold, undoubtedly, and very likely the interest, which, between brothers, would be reckoned just. The damage my family sustained through your inhuman treatment is incalculable.” Having said this I asked him “if he had any money for present use, and whether he was well supplied with necessaries,” he replied “that he wanted for nothing,” and we left him. Jinkins was well pleased that I was likely to be independent. In the goodness of his heart, he could not help observing “that he was glad the fellow had enough to pay me, and that his lot was cast amongst such noble hearted people.” “If it had not been for you, dear Jinkins, and the best of men, you would have had one less.” He said he “was sorry for Horton, but that other d—I was beyond every thing.” “These pirates are mostly from the north,” said Jinkins: “I should be afraid to live in a cold country like this,—it's just a nest of cold hearted, cold blooded, heathen sort of folks,—they look as shy at one, as if 'twas old Davy—damme if I like to be amongst 'um, to tell you the truth.” He forgot that my uncle and I were born in the northern states. I enquired of him, as we walked alone, whether it was a general practice with my uncle to sit up so late— that his hours and mine by no means agreed—that I felt quite unwell. “O, he has no particular rule,” answered Jinkins, “he is fond of company night or day.” With such conversation we gained our lodgings. “Well child how do'st thee and Hunter make it—do'st think he'll pay thee—curse him—I wish thee was done wi' him—'let him get out o' my sight—I hates the looks o' him.” I informed him that I had received one hundred and twelve thousand two hundred and sixty-four dollars from him, and that there were still one hundred and twelve thousand two hundred and sixty-four dollars behind, counting the interest only on the bonds, which were upwards of twenty years, though I had calculated them at twenty years only. “Ah, the dog, thee oughten to bated him an ace—thee has too much o' the Burlington blood in thee.” “Perhaps it is all I can get,” replied I, “and much more than I expected.” “Thee'll have to divide with Horton here, just a sum for gratuity: I'll make it to thee, my son, thee knows, and it would seem doing one good turn for another, thee understands me? and when I hears from Boston we'll give Hunter a bit, and just let him go to the d—I his own way.” The men now arrived, who were the other witnesses to the conveyance: after treating them with the best we had, we all set out to have the conveyance proved, that I might take possession of the property. I was put in possession of the houses by the same Mr. S—, who had been appointed by Hunter to value it. This man, it appeared, acted as agent for him. When I handed him the letter from Hunter, (which was open) requesting him to put me in possession, he seemed to be much surprised, and asked me “where was Hunter himself? he would be glad to see him first?” “Here is the conveyance, sir,” said I, “you see it is signed by himself—you see the consideration and you have written instructions to give me peaceable possession, which I demand before these witnesses: if you do not, you must abide by the consequences. I have no more to say,” and was about to return, when he called me and said, “he would give me possession.” Whether he suspected the truth, as regarded Hunter's situation, or whether he was ignorant of Hunter's character and practices, I was at a loss to determine: certain it was that he appeared to me to be afraid to enquire further about him, yet I might have been mistaken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. Upon being put in possession of the property, I requested the names of the tenants and the rate per annum, in order to exact from them the rent, which was to go on from that day. One of the houses was a very spacious brick building, containing three stores or shops, several lumber-rooms and four families. The other was comparatively small;—only two stores were kept in it, and three families above stairs. I determined to let them remain in it until I should consult Mrs. Cary. If she was willing to remove to New-York, this house would suit her very well, but if she preferred a residence in Philadelphia, she should certainly have the option. One of the families in the latter had the appearance of being in perfect indigence. They were lately from Ireland, (indeed they were all Irish, but this family had not long arrived from thence,) had been sick and made a wretched appearance. The family consisted of a man, his wife and six children. Two of their children had died since they landed, and two others were then lying in bed very ill. The man looked like a ghost, and the woman very little better. He reeled as he attempted to walk. I informed him I had become his landlord, and that he would have to give a new lease, as I walked to the bed on which the children were lying, to examine their pulse. Their fever was excessively high indeed. “Ah, poor things,” said their mother, “they're very ill, they haven't tasted mate these eight days.” I asked her “if a physician attended them?” “No indeed your honour, they're no the sort o' Doctors that we have in the aul counthry—he's just been, but the bare twiste, and gives them a sort o' stuff, a don't know what it is.” “Jinkins,” said I, “go for the best Physician you can get, my friend.” “The Lord bless you, for that's the kindest word I heard spoken since I been in the counthry,” said the afflicted mother. I asked her “if she was able to walk out, to get a little wine, and such things as might be necessary?” “Aye, indeed am I—I'm not overly strong yet, but I ha' been up and down tha stairs twenty times a day.” “Here then madam, take this (handing her my purse) and go get some wine and such things as you may want for yourself and your children.” “The Lard presarve us—but you are no a man at all, you're just an angel, so ye are—save us, what will I do with all this?” “Go on, go on madam,” said I, “there is only a few dollars in it.” When she left the room, the man expressed, or began to make great acknowledgments, but I silenced him by asking “how long it was since he landed in the United States?” He replied “that it was three months, and that he had not been able to do any work since.—And what would your honor be after asking for the rent,” said he “you were saying I'd be till give a new lease?” “Nothing sir,” said I, “I just want your obligation to deliver the property to me, or my agent.” No thought I, sooner would I beg my bread from door to door, than exact ought of this poor man. He was about to overwhelm me with thanks, as Jinkins and the physician entered the room. The doctor bowed, and asked if those were the patients? I told him they were, and getting up gave him the only seat there was in the room. After he examined them, I asked him “if he could do any thing for them?” “Certainly,” said he, “they are not beyond the reach of medicine: with attention they will recover.” “My dear sir,” said I, “do your best, I will amply reward your pains.” 18 He made no reply, but called for a string to bleed them. He then gave them an emetic, and said he would stay and see it operate. Just as I had agreed to meet him there again at six o'clock that evening, the mother returned with a fowl, a bottle of wine, and two or three small loaves of bread; she bowed to the doctor, and setting her things out of her hand on the floor, (no table being in the room) she approached me with— “God preserve me—but ye told me there was only a few dollars, and it's all goold, half-joes and some sort o' guineas—I never see'd the like. O, if I wasn't scared out o' my wits when I went to pay the man for the wine, I trembled like a leaf. `What's the matter, good woman?' said the man—`Nothing,' says I, `but the gentleman has surely been mistaken to rust me with so much goold, Agles I think he called them, makin' his fun.' Marcy, if I didn't fly, wi' all speed back, fearing somebody would rob me; ye shouldn't trust a poor woman body like me wi' all your money, it might have been all robbed from me,” said she, handing me the purse with its remaining contents. I could not forbear laughing at her, as I took the purse out of her hand, not with a view of taking back the money, but to empty the contents into her hand, not caring to part with the purse. “Aye, sir, do look, alay my life she's let them chate her, she is such a simpleton,” said her husband; but when he discovered my object, he was thunderstruck. Before I left her, however, I explained that the large pieces, pointing them out to her, were ten dollars, and the smaller ones five. I told her that I should return again in the evening and in the meantime “I should send her a girl to assist her: that the fatigue she must undergo, attending upon her children was more than she was able to bear in her present situation.” I waited not for a reply, but telling Jinkins we would walk, took leave and proceeded to our lodgings. As we walked onward, I asked the first person I met, where I should find a girl? that I wished to procure one to attend a sick family. He told me to step into any of the alleys, and I would find one almost at every house. I thanked him, and proceeding into one of those alleys, found no difficulty whatever in obtaining a servant; I might have got a dozen had I wanted them. I stepped up to one and told her my business—she very readily assented. I enquired her name. “Sarah Murphy, sir,” said she. Irish to Irish, I thought. “Well, Sarah, my good girl, I wish you to proceed to my house,” telling her the number, “without delay. Make haste—the family is in great distress. I'll pay you your wages: here, I'll give you earnest,” (pulling out my empty purse.) Jinkins laughed, and told the girl as he handed her a dollar, “that I was the greatest cheat in the city: not to believe a word I said—but put off Sarah, you shall be paid,” said the mischievous Jinkins. As we pursued our walk, I picked up a lawyer to do the necessary writings respecting the leases, giving him a memorandum of the business I wished him to perform, I directed him to bring them when done to the City Hotel. When we arrived at home we found dinner ready, and my uncle chided me for staying so long. But when I explained the cause to him he was pleased. “Ah,” said he, “thee's my fellow; I wouldn't give a rope's-end for money to hoard it up, and a comrade dying o' want—od if 'don't go and see 'um myself. How far does't live?” I observed “that the evening was too cold for him to turn out, but he could wrap himself up warm to-morrow and go, and look at my property; that the poor family I mentioned lived in one of the houses—meantime if he had no objection, I would invite the doctor to sup with us, provided he was unengaged.” “Oh, to be sure, I am surprised—why can't ye have whoever thee likes, child, without axin o' me. And Jinkins did go the rounds wi' thee?” “Yes,” I replied, “Jinkins went for the doctor, and gave me some other very seasonable assistance.” “Yes,” said Jinkins in his usual manner—“he looked well after telling the girl he'd pay her earnest, pulling out an empty purse.” My uncle laughed at the jest, and we sat down to dinner. Being fatigued from incessant walking in the morning, I proposed some game of amusement to my uncle. “Well, choose your game, I'm your man.” “You will beat me too easy at backgammon, let's have a game at whist—I'll take Jinkins, and you take the landlord.” “Agreed,” said he. “But, where is Horton?” I asked. “Was he not here?” “Oh! yes, he keeps a grieving about his wife and children—he'll be back again he said. Sambo, go and tell the landlord to come, and bring a pack o' cards.” In a short time he appeared. I requested Sambo to recruit the fire and we sat down and played till six o'clock. I requested the landlord to have a good supper, observing, as I put on my great coat “that I would have a stranger with me when I returned.” He bowing and retired—I set out alone, leaving Jinkins to keep my uncle company. “Tell 'um,” said the old man, “I'll come and see 'um myself to-morrow, God willing.” The Doctor had been there but a few minutes before me, and upon enquiring how the patients were, he informed me that the fever had abated considerably; that the pulse promised favourably, and there was little doubt but they would be better by morning. He gave them some pills, and said he would call again early in the morning. The poor woman was in raptures, upon hearing the report of the Doctor. Both her and her husband eyed me, as if I had been a Deity, whom they seemed to love, as well as fear. She was making herself a coarse dress, which was barely fit for a human being to wear. I suspect the poor creature had purchssed it out of the money I gave her, and grudged herself a better, lest she might encroach too much upon her funds. I therefore, while the doctor was engaged with the children, entered familiarly into conversation with her upon the impropriety of working with a needle, until she was perfectly well—that she would injure her eyes. The Doctor said “she could not do any thing worse; it was too severe upon the eyes.” I desired her to send Sarah out and get plenty of nourishing food and drink for herself and her husband—they ought to have plenty of wine, fresh broths, and such things, and not to stint herself in any thing; that I perceived she was quite too stingy.” “I was telling her so myself,” said her husband, “just a bit ago. She says we'll want wood to keep the children warm; if such a gentleman as this comes across us, says I, we'll want nothing.” I saw nothing to eat or to drink in the chamber, with the exception of the bread, &amp;c. she bought in the morning, but some raw potatoes. The children, those that were not sick, looked as though they were famished.— Ah, poverty! thou art an ugly thing. I addressed the Doctor, when his visit was over, telling him “I should be happy if he would favour me with his company that evening, that I had bespoke an oyster supper at the City Hotel, and every thing else that the city afforded, that he would meet an old gentleman there, who was rather uncouth in his manners, having been at sea most of his life, but one of the best hearted men in the world—he was another uncle Toby.” He thanked me, and said he would go with pleasure. When we arose to depart, I shook hands with the family, telling Sarah “if she would be a good girl, and attend well upon the children, I would buy her the finest gown in New-York.” “Indeed, I will do that, sir, if you were to give me nothing at all.” As I walked down stairs, I called to mind my uncle's message, it would have been cruel to have neglected it. Though couched in few and plain words, it shewed the genuine qualities of his heart. I begged pardon a minute, and turning back, delivered the message. 18* “God bless him, say't we're much obliged to his honour.” exclaimed both. As there was no other alternative, we, I mean the Doctor and I, introduced ourselves to each other. His name was Nevitt. As we walked to the hotel, he observed. “You are a stranger in this city, I presume?” I told him “I was.” “I knew almost,” said he, “that you were, from the sympathy you expressed for those poor people. We who are accustomed to see such things daily, have become quite callous to it. Perhaps no city in the universe evinces a greater proof of charity than New-York; humane societies both public and private, are established throughout the city, of both sexes, who make it their business and pride to attend and relieve the poor, and yet numbers die for want of attention. So many foreigners pour in upon us, particularly from Ireland, who generally arrive sick, and have not the means of providing for themselves, that I assure you it keeps us busy to attend to them, and after doing all in our power many of them suffer as you see. The poor creatures spend all they have in getting here, and then they are mostly so sick, (particularly their children) that they are unable to get any further, and here we have them upon us. I am certain that in the course of my practice two-thirds of it has been devoted to those poor people. You have seen nothing of our city; if you were to spend a day or two visiting those alleys, you would be surprised to see the number of poor people, and particularly when any epidemic rages. If you were to relieve all that actually stood in need of relief you would soon have nothing to relieve with; and at this season of the year their situation is at the worst, wood being so high that the poor cannot afford enough to keep themselves warm. I have known instances of their lying in bed all day for want of fuel.” I was much pleased and improved by the Doctor's conversation. “A sad picture, sir, you have given me of human distress, but I have suffered so much myself that perhaps I feel more sensibly for their situation than one that has not; merely seeing and not feeling misery cannot have the same effect on us.” “Very true,” said the Doctor—“but what would be the conclusion, because you felt more sensibly you would relieve more bountifully and more extensively: you would find no end to it, and by that means you would soon put it out of your power to relieve any. For instance, you would relieve all the distressed this year: next year you might do the same, and so on; and by an imprudent liberality to some, would deprive others who might be equally entitled to charity.” There was a great deal of justice and reason in the Doctor's remarks, and I resolved to profit by them. “Tell me what you would have done,” said I, “had you happened upon those poor people we have just left?” “Most certainly, sir,” replied he, “I would have given them physic, or probably had them conveyed to the hospital; I would have given them a moderate share of food and clothes, or have seen that it was done.” I must keep out of those alleys then, thought I, as we entered the Hotel; it will not do for either me or my uncle to visit them. I introduced the Doctor to my uncle and Jinkins. “Well, how do'st come on, Doctor, with the sick people?” said the old man, “take some wine, sir—do'st think can cure 'um?” “I think I can, sir; the fever seems to yield considerably.” “Ah, curse the fevers, I had 'um myself, they're not good company: I had 'um best part o' three weeks see, and I'm not quite over 'um yet—but mighty glad as Charles happened on 'um to-day. How did come to find 'um out my son?” “They were in one of the houses I purchased of Hunter, sir; and in visiting the apartments to take down the people's names, for the purpose of executing new leases, I found this family in distress.” “Didn't tell 'um should pay rent, did ye?” “I did not, sir; on the contrary, I told them they might live there gratis until they were all well.” “Thee did'st right, me son, that was right—'calls. him my son. Doctor, though he's only my nevy—But he's just as like me as if 'was my son, and I don't see how that can be: you landsmen be always as fraid o' your purse, as if ye thought some serpent in it would bite off your fingers.” The servant entered and before any of us could reply, told us supper was ready. The landlord had fulfilled his promise with much honour to himself—a fine dish of oysters was smoking at each end of the table, which was set as usual exclusively for us, and every other dainty the market afforded at that season. Wine and cheerful conversation seasoned the whole —After supper the Doctor sat a couple of hours, conversing principally with the old gentleman; on taking leave he said “he would visit his patients early in the morning, and probably they would need no more attention.” “Od, Doctor, thee must visit 'um till 'gets well—I'm going to see 'um myself, in the morning, I wants to see how 'looks when 'is just saved from starvation, with sickness, and want, and such things.” “Oh, sir, they are quite ravished with your nephew, after he made his escape from them in the morning—`the Lord save us, and what sort of a man is yon, see the goold he's given me,' said the woman. `And wouldn't wait till he thanked an' our last fire of wood was just laid on—I tould you, William, till trust in the Lord when ye were loth till purt on, but ye never believe what I say. Ye see now what he has done, when I mind ye of that again now ye'll believe. Oh, blessed be his Name, for He is the God that helps in throuble. It would be long ere ye'd get this in Ireland, ye might get a few saxpences or there-away, maybe, at a fair, and he's gone till send me a nurse for my children, bless the man. I don't know who he is, and sent the gentleman that was wi' him, almost the moment he come in for a Doctor; ye'll mind now, William, when I bid ye trust in the Lord—see here how much there is, one, two, three, four, five, six o' these big ones, Agles I think he called them, and how many o' the little ones, let me see—seven, and ever so many silver pieces, I don't know what they are: but maybe I didn't give them the goold a day, weary on them—the Lord forgive me, but I thought the gentleman would have me hanged if I touched his goold, and see he's give it all to me.”' “Ye can pay your rent now, Matty, it's due in a few days,” said her husband. “Yes indeed they may come as soon as they like, I'll warrant they come time enough, they're not like his honour that's got the house now long life till him,” said the man, “he tould me when ye wer' gone to buy things, that I might stay in it rent free.” “Did he?” rejoined the woman. “I left them both praying for his long life and prosperity. Good evening gentlemen.” “You must call again Doctor, wont'ee?” said my uncle, as the Doctor withdrew. The next day when the cool of the morning was over, and I thought my uncle could go out with safety, I had a carriage brought to the door for him to ride to the Irishman's, while he was wrapping himself up in a double portion of flannel, cursing the cold country all the while, the lawyer came with the papers. After every thing was ready, I stepped into his chamber for the old gentleman. I saw him as I entered, sliping something in his pocket, telling Sambo to stay in his room until he returned. On our way, we drove by the other house, wishing to show it to my uncle likewise, he expressed great satisfaction upon seeing it, saying “it'll bring thee some rent child, better saved than lost.” I asked him “if he did not want an apartment or two in it to stow his freight,” as I perceived it still aboard the ship, that it would suit him very well, and I wished to know, as I was about to rent them. “O I han't much there, I ha' sold the most o' it.—I got but a few things, one small store-room will hold it, thee may save one since it 'ill please thee to do thy uncle a kindness.” When we arrived at the other house, the old man's patience was almost overthrown again at the high houses. He made out however, with Jinkin's assistance, and a great deal of grunting puffing and blowing, to effect his landing at the head of the stairs, swearing all the way “that none but a lubberly landsman would build such a house, and that if it was his, he would throw it down right away, fore some body would break their necks.” When he entered the chamber, he greeted the lady and shook her husband by the hand, and enquired “how doest all do, how is thy sick ones?” “Oh God be praised your honour, but their getting bravely, said their father.” “I'me glad to hear it, glad to hear it, but friend thee must tell us thy name.” “William McCallester, please your honour.” “Well Mr. McCallester—” “The Lord love you sir, don't Mr. me, William's my name.” “Well William then, to tell the truth, o'the matter, I was raised a bit that way myself, but went to sea and forgot all thae things, and learned to swear, and say bad words to boot, but my nevy was sayin' see' that 'had been sick and puny, and thought would ride over a bit, and see how come on, and I ha' been sick myself too.” “May the blessing attend you for that, but your nevy and yourself both thegether, has saved all our lives,” said Matty, her husband (as she appeared to think,) being too cold in his plaudits, “God knows for I don't know where's the like o'ye.” I saw by the wrinkle on my uncle's brow, that it was pouring upon him too fast. “Where be the children,” said he, paying not the least attention to Matty. “There they are,” said William, pointing to them as they lay in the bed. He got up and went to them, felt of their pulse, spoke kindly to them and told them “when they got well they must come to his lodgings and get some sugar-plumbs— must be good children and take what the Doctor tells thee, be well in a trice, I ha' got the most sugar-plums, apples, oranges, and ginger-cakes ever thee seed, soon be well, must'nt eat um till gets well.” Jinkins who had stepped down stairs almost as soon as we entered, re-appeared with calico to make the little girls dresses, cloth to make the little boys' pantaloons and roundabouts. There were three boys and three girls; he handed it to Matty who was in raptures again, but Jinkins was as unconcerned at this ebullition as his patron.—For myself, I was displeased that she had not appropriated part of the money I gave her to this use, as the poor things were all in rags, nor could I perceive any addition to their general comforts, with the exception of a bottle of wine, and one or two old chairs, that I presumed they had borrowed from their next neighbour. After my uncle had gratified his curiosity and his feelings, I proposed that he should return with Jinkins, that I had some business to attend to and would return on foot, getting them first to attest the obligation between me and McCallester. We took leave of the family, Matty accompanying us to the head of the stairs, blessing and re-blessing us while we were in hearing. Being advanced rather before my uncle and Jinkins, I turned round to get hold of the old gentleman's hand, when I saw him hand Matty something with the quickness of lightning almost; she was going to speak, but he silenced her with a “prithee not a word,” and gave his hand to descend the stairs. I seemed not to see what I thought he wished to conceal. He and Jinkins entered the carriage and drove home, whilst I repaired to the respective tenants to receive their acknowledgments, and joined the party at dinner. “Well, my son, just wondering what had become of thee, take some wine, 'dare say thee needs it—made Sambo keep up a good fire gin' would come,” said he, taking a glass of wine himself—“but thee don't mind these cold winds at all like Jinkins and I—I thought would afroze coming home, don't think thy uncle can stand it in this cold country, and Jinkins and Sambo complains almost as much as I do.” “Charles,” said he, as we were seating ourselves at table—“what sort o' a woman does that be? didn't know what to make o' 'um, thought she had taken a fit when the boy brought 'um the garments—'think it's a tantalizing sort o' thing,” said he, as he supped his broth—“didn't know what to make o' her sort o' language.” “Oh, sir, she followed the dictates of her heart no doubt, she knew no other way to express her gratitude, and her rescue from pinching want. Hunger, sickness, and cold, are dreadful calamities, and she was actually relieved from them all; no wonder at all to me, that her joy was so extravagant.” I wished to set his mind at rest, on a subject so near his heart, though I disliked the fulsome stuff as much as he did. “And what do'st think o' Jinkins, see how gallant he behaved too?” “I did, sir, but he is too much like yourself in that respect, he is too modest to listen to applause. Any man who does a generous act, never wishes to hear of it more. You ask me what I think of him? but this question you did not expect me to answer in his presence.” “Enough,” said Jinkins, “you make me sick.” “Well tell'ee what, my sons, Jinkins is my son too— but what 'was going to say, is that thee and I, Charles, just think alike a out thae things, but thee's got a glibber tongue in thy head than I, and can fetch it out better.” Having finished our dinner, the Commodore thus addressed me and Jinkins— “Tell'ee what thee do boys, if 'baint too tired, 'wants to go to the Eliza, (name of the vessel) and tell'ee what 'wants thee to go for. “First thing thee does deliver the balance of the freight that be marked S. T. to him, or his agent, and all that be marked T. B. put into the ware-house that thee's kept for me, Charles. “And the things that the governor of Havanna put aboard—Jinkins knows um, ship um to Mary forth with —the pipe o' wine, and box o' china, d'ye hear, 'don't know what could 'think I'd want wi' china, did think 'was going—a house keeping again? “But since old Frank showed a kindness, they'll serve for Mary's wedding, and d'ye hear, write to Mary that her uncle will be there and help to drink the wine. “Send um off directly, that 'may have um in time— wouldn't miss their being sent for ten times the worth of um, and should a sent them before now, but thou bast been engaged with thy own business. “And harkee boy, don't stay long, I be lonesome and like o' that—thank God I'm no coward, but atween ourselves, I don't like these out-landish folks much—an impudent scamp o' a fellow bolted into my room this morning—if 'hadn't a been off 'soon as he did I'd a shivered his upper works for him. “I am just going to take a nap, and Sambo will stay, and you'll soon be back.” We assured him we would use all possible despatch, and putting on our great coats we set out. As we pursued our walk, I observed to Jinkins “that my uncle spoke as if he had not that confidence in his situation consistant with his happiness—had he much money about him? or what did he (as he seemed to do) distrust in the citizens of New-York?” He replied, “that he never kept much about his person, the small trunk in his chamber was all, that his funds were principally in England, with the exception of a few thousand dollars, which he deposited in the bank in New-York, upon his arrival, for safe keeping. “That the dislike I heard him express, merely extended to the manners and ways of the people, being so different from his own.” This explanation relieved me considerably by removing that anxiety I should otherwise have felt, while absent —I nevertheless lost not a moment and proceeded to procure cart-men to convey my uncle's reserve, while Jinkins waited on S. T. requesting him to come and receive his goods. In the course of the conversation with Jinkins, on the subject of my uncle's wealth, he stated the amount at upwards of a million pounds sterling! I obtained from Mr. S T. the address of Wharton &amp; Co. of Philadelphia, to whom I consigned the present for Mary. In the meantime I paid Hunter a visit, and 19 informed him that I had received the property at its valuation, and asked him— “If he had made an estimate of the amount himself, that I wished him to be satisfied, and not to say hereafter that I had taken advantage of his situation.” He replied, “that the interest of the bonds was easily counted, that in twenty years they would double themselves, and that I could if I chose, exact interest for the property, as he felt perfectly unconcerned about any thing whatever.” I told him I should not, and addressing him in a more friendly manner than I had hitherto done, entreated him not to be discouraged, that he would be restored to his liberty once more, and I hoped his misfortunes would be attended with a salutary effect; it would be the best incident of his life, if it should be productive of reformation. He began to weep, I pitied him sincerely; he asked me “if I had heard of his son?” I replied I had not heard a word of him since I left Philadelphia, but I would enquire and let him know the result. I recommended to him “to bethink himself of some asylum, to which he could retire: that perhaps it would not be safe for him to remain in the States, although neither my uncle or myself had any intention to injure him, yet I could not be certain that Horton would not, though my uncle had strictly charged him not utter a word on the subject; but we were going to Philadelphia, and no one knew what he might do in that event— he might however act as he pleased, I merely suggested the propriety of the thing.” I enquired how much money he had, or whether he had any about his person? He pulled out a small purse of gold, which I did not wait for him to count, there might have been forty or fifty guineas in it. I shook hands with him, told him not to despond, that he should not be stripped of every thing, that I would divide with him as long as he lived, provided he behaved himself, and would let me know where to find him. He shed a flood of tears, but made no answer. As I left him I desired the guard to let him want for nothing. Upon enquiry I found that S. T. would by no means succeed in receiving the goods that day, nor for two days to come, at the rate they proceeded. It was now nearly sun-set, and excessively cold, I therefore proposed to Jinkins that we should return home, and let them attend in the morning with a more effective force. In fact I shivered with cold, as also did Jinkins, and was very near being provoked besides, at those hardy sons of the north, who, with shirt sleeves rolled up, perfectly unconcerned, burst into a loud fit of laughter at Jinkins and myself. When we returned home we found Horton and the old man there—as much rejoiced to see us as if we had been absent a week. Horton had been twice to see me in the course of the present and preceding day; I apologzied to him, saying that the pressure of business had put it out of my power to attend to him. “I told him,” said my uncle, “that thee was run off thy legs.” He had made no discovery relative to his wife—the last that was known of her, was, “that she despaired of paying her rent, and absconded in the night, taking her children with her, and what little movables she had; and that her youngest child was six months old.” These particulars he learned from her next neighbour. I observed it was pretty evident she had left the city, and that she must have taken water, as she could not have conveyed her children by any other means: he ought to put an advertisement in the papers, I knew of no other way. “It may be that she has gone to Boston, or perhaps Philadelphia: I should enquire when I arrived there, but the surest course would be to advertise.” Calling for pen, ink, and paper, I wrote to Wilson, for the first time since I left him, instructing him to attend to receiving the groceries, which would be delivered to Wharton &amp; Co. that it was a present to Mary from her uncle, and that he would shortly be there himself, and help to drink the wine: briefly, that the whole of the articles were to decorate the wedding supper, which she might expect in the course of eight or ten days, at farthest. I gave him a summary of all the news I deemed of interest to him, and enclosed one hundred dollars for each of the girls, to make any further addition they might chuse, against the long looked for day. Being at leisure I repeated to my uncle the particulars of my interview with Hunter. The old gentleman seemed much perplexed in mind on account of this wretched man, he seemed to be at a loss what course to pursue in the final disposal of him. “Charles,” said he, “I wish'ee would give thy opinion about him, I hates to see the fellow hanged after taking from him all he's got, and yet it seems to be kind o' taking the laws in one's own hand. Hang it all, 'wish 'ad been to the d—I before 'come across him—Doesn't seem sorry?” “He does sir.” “Curse him, 'don't want to hurt a hair of his head.” I hastened to set his mind at ease, by telling him that “were I in his place, as soon as we heard from Boston I would just give him the balance of his property, if there should be any left, and if there were not I would give him enough to support him—give him his liberty and let him go where he pleased. I saw no impropriety in it at all, that if this course was not consistent with justice it was with mercy. “As for taking all he has, I have not—I have only retaken my own, at infinite loss, and with his own consent, (I gave him the option) and this I should have done in any event.” “But my son thee knowest he's a vile wretch, 'may turn about when's got his liberty, and swear that thee tak'd it unfair, or somehow like that, and would make it out as force work, being confined—I ha' been thinking a good deal about it.” “Let him try that, no danger—he could take no step on that ground that would not tend to his own destruction. Don't you believe, sir, that Hunter, knave as he is, would be such a fool as to attempt any thing of that sort? “Make yourself perfectly easy, sir, on Hunter's account; I will take the entire responsibility on myself in every thing which relates to him. “As to the suppression of the prosecution against Hunter, so far from considering it culpable, it would be thought malicious and revengeful. What did I know of Hunter? my testimony would not criminate him, I saw no overt acts—true, he was, in company with the pirates by whom I was taken, but I knew him not as Hunter until we were in the cavern—he plotted my death, but I am still alive. “Horton's testimony would condemn him; but who is Horton? equally as notorious as Hunter by his own confession. In the event of a prosecution I, as well as yourself, would be compelled to declare the whole truth, which would go very near invalidating, if not altogether defeating Horton's testimony. “I see nothing therefore incompatible with the nicest sense of justice in the contemplated lenity to Hunter.” “Well my son, thee may take the disposal of him thyself,” said my uncle, “I know nothing about thae law matters, I likes to hear thee speak kind hearted about it, and if thee had been a lawyer pleading for 'um, couldn't ha' said more.” The next morning Jinkins went to deliver the balance of the freight, and as this was the first opportunity I had had, I related to my uncle the distressed situation in which I found my sister and her companions. Taking the letters I had received from her in Tennessee out of my pocket book, I read them to the old gentleman. It was with great difficulty I got through the performance, and it was indeed the first time I had dared to read them with any kind of attention. As I proceeded, the perturbation of my uncle's feelings increased, until in the end he wept like a child, and I was very little behind him. The first sentence he uttered after wiping his eyes, was— “Well, thae Hunters must be limbs o' the d—l; 'couldn't let a poor woman alone. That Dupon, or whatever be his name, is a prince of a man; Oh, how 'do 19* love him—and what be the names of thae women that showed a kindness to your sister?” “Mrs. Cary and her daughter sir.” “And shall 'see 'um?” “Yes sir, they are all together.” “Oh! if 'don't hug 'um—'wish 'was there now,” getting up and walking the floor with hasty steps, “and as for thae Simmons or Simkins, the d—l if there be's any d—l ought to get 'um—'cant see how. Well, a bad woman's a bad thing. “Give me some wine, Sambo—God Almighty will ha ye happy at last in spite o' 'um—all but me; ah, my son, this is a short life, but long trouble; but I shall see my Eliza and my babe, and would cheerfully leave this world to-morrow. “The Lord has truly laid heavy afflictions on our house, my child; but 'twas his will to do so and I submit —whom he loveth he chasteneth, my father used to say; I ha' often thought o' that. He chastened him sore, and has chastened his sons. “He was a good Christian man—'was meek as a lamb. And thee tak'd the women out o' the old house first thing, that was right—'ought to ha' been hanged if thee hadn't.—Alligators, alligators all! why they're as bad as pirates.” At the end of seven days from the time I wrote to Boston, I received an answer to both letters, one from Mr. S— and one from Mrs. Jones. Mrs. Jones' letter was as follows: “Sir— I received your favour this day: I am truly glad to hear that you have returned, and that Mary is at length happy. I have never heard of Dupon since Mrs. Cary left here—old Mr. Simpson is dead. His oldest daughter, Clarissa, ran away with Hunter, it is supposed, as she was missing the night he escaped from prison, and has never been heard of since. “It was thought by some that she assisted him in getting out; some say they went to Philadelphia, others say to New-York. It was thought that this conduct of his daughter, and that of his profligate son, broke the old man's heart. “The family is now in great distress, having had almost every thing sold by the creditors of Mr. Simpson. The young Simpson roams about the town a despised vagabond. Dear sir please to give my love and best respects to the ladies, and tell Mary I wish her a great deal of happiness, and shall expect a bride's favour. Yours, respectfully, SARAH JONES.” Mr. S—'s letter ran thus: “Sir— I hasten to reply to both yours of this instant. Hunter owns the property mentioned in your letter. You refer to me for information respecting its value: this I would wish to decline.—In the first place I am not a judge; and in the second place the price of property is so fluctuating that it is not easy to say. It might sell to day six per cent higher than it would to-morrow. “It rents at present for — dollars per annum: perhaps it might sell for — thousand dollars. I have — thousand dollars in my hands, subject to Hunter's order. There is no incumbrance on the property, at least none that I know of. “I have just seen Mr. P— he says Dupon left this city two years ago, supercargo for a trading house in Kingston, Jamaica. “He superintended some commercial concerns for the house of P— &amp; Co. in this city, as being concerned with the aforesaid house in Liverpool. Dupon was to have returned to the United States, but hearing his father was in bad health, and of some other indispensable business, he proceeded to Liverpool, and sent an agent here who has continued to act for the firm ever since.— This is all the information, sir, that I am able to give you respecting him. “Your obedient servant, S—.” I waited on Hunter the moment I received the letters, taking witnesses along with me to attest the conveyance of the property. I left it to him, however, to execute an order for the money, as I wished to have done with him, or a title to the property, alledging that perhaps he might sustain loss in selling it just now, as the apprehension of war would undoubtedly influence the value of such property in Boston, and I wished him to make no sacrifice on my account. True, the money did not quite amount to the balance due me, but this I told him made no difference—I would execute a receipt in full. He preferred the latter alternative and executed an order for the money, which I received that evening, through Mr. L. of New-York, who very politely paid the money and took in the order—and once more I waited on Hunter. I gave him a receipt in full, told him he was now at liberty to go where he pleased, that I should preserve inviolable secrecy on the subject of his late conduct, so long as he continued to behave well, and would undertake for the rest of our party. “But the moment I hear of the smallest deviation in your conduct, Hunter, you are done for this world—the property owned in Boston, and the bonds he possessed, would support him handsomely, and maintain his son, should he ever find him.” I asked him “if he had any other children?” “—He had not, he had never had but that one, and wished he had never been born.” “Where is your wife?” “She is dead.” “Well, you have enough left yet, and perhaps more than in strict justice you are entitled to: but I spare your feelings Hunter, since I find you are possessed of some— God grant you may reform and become a good man, and should you ever happen to fall into want or distress, Hunter, call on me, I will divide my last dollar with you.” He wept during the whole conversation. I told him I must leave him, being in haste to prepare for leaving New-York, and that if he wished to leave the country, I wonld aid him in any way he wished, or render him any other service in my power.” He asked me “where Horton was?” I replied, “I believed he was still in the city; that he was almost in a state of distraction on account of his wife and children—they had left New-York, and no one could tell where they had gone. “I saw her in Philadelphia,” said Hunter, “the last time I was there, about two years since, and have seen Horton often since; but as he never mentioned her name to me, I never thought of it since. I understood he had another wife.” “Yes, he acknowledges that to his sorrow; but she has left him and he is very anxious to find his real wife —he will be glad to hear of her.” “Mr. Burlington,” said Hunter, “do you think Horton would betray me? I have some business I wish to arrange in the city, and then I would gladly seek my son and endeavour to reclaim him.” To this I replied “he had promised the contrary both to me and my uncle; but what confidence his word is entitled to, I cannot say. You know the man better than I do, you must judge for yourself.—I shall, however, name the subject to him again, and make it the condition of exemption from prosecution to which he has subjected himself by his own confession. You wish, then, to remain in the city?” “I believe I will remain here a week or two,” said he, as he discovered I was about to leave him. “Horton, you said, ought to have something—here's a bond for seven hundred dollars, please to—” I interrupted him, telling him to keep it, “I would give Horton a trifle to begin the world with—that he had little enough for himself.” He began to make acknowledgments of eternal gratitude; but I interrupted him, saying he must excuse me: that indispensable business pressed me to leave him, telling him that I should leave New-York early in the morning for Philadelphia, where I should be glad to hear from him when convenient—that nothing would give me more pleasure than to hear of his well doing: that I should enquire for his son, and not fail to let him know, should I discover any thing of him. I for this purpose took a memorandum of his address, and shook him cordially by the hand. “I forgive you sincerely,” said I. “God bless you, Mr. Burlington,” said Hunter, the tears streaming down his cheeks—“God bless you wherever you go.” The sailors, mate, and captain, who had accompanied my uncle from Havanna, and who had been previously paid, although they acted as guard upon Hunter, were ignorant of the cause of his confinement. Nothing therefore was to be apprehended from them injurious to him, had they remained in the country, but they were on their way to Havanna—having discharged them in the morning. On my way to the Hotel I was met by Horton, who was actually going to see Hunter to enquire about his wife. He had called to see me, and being told that Hunter would soon leave the place, he hastened thither to demand something for his services, and enqure (as his last resort) respecting his wife, as Hunter had been twice in the States since he had. I told him what Hunter had said about her, and had he wished to have known what had become of her he might have done so long since. He now resolved to go on with us, to Philadelphia, if we wold permit him. “Certainly,” said I, “Horton you may go—and as for taking any thing away from Hunter it is out of the question: he has barely enough to support himself, he is old and you are not, therefore you can do better without.” He said he should not have pretended to ask any thing from Hunter, but for me and my uncle—he had understood us as enjoining it upon him to do so; he was not in want—the Governor of Havanna had given him sufficient to keep him from want, though he had strictly charged him to conceal it from the Commodore, lest he might be offended. “Curse the money: I didn't want it at all.” “Well, come along,” said I, “I have several things to do this evening; I hope you will find your wife yet, and be happy. “I told Hunter I would give you a trifle, he was going to give you a bond of seven hundred dollars, but I would by no means take it from him. I would rather have paid it out of my own pocket. “But let me tell you now Horton, as perhaps I will not be at leisure shortly, never do you mouth about Hunter, I have forgiven him for all his cruelty and oppression to me and my family, and I think you may extend your lenity to him for crimes of which you have been equally guilty. “Besides, you engaged with him with your eyes open —you were a free man, and can have no motive under heaven for informing against him, other than revenge— you would gain nothing by it, you have tried that; and you may rest assured, that the very moment you disclose one syllable respecting his conduct, I will invalidate your testimony. “I will enter a prosecution against you as his accumplice, and you will find it go much harder with you than with him. By invalidating your testimony he would be acquitted. He has taken nothing from you that you or he either have a right to. I believe in justice you ought both to be hung; but I shall never injure you. In fact I know nothing of him that would convict him, but I know enough to convict you.” Horton declared solemnly that he never would attempt to injure him; and so far he has kept his word, for they are alive yet. So soon as we entered our lodgings I desired Jinkins and Sambo to get every thing ready for our journey to Philadelphia—that we would set out by day-light next morning. “That's good news,” replied the old man, “I hope it aint so nation cold there as 'tis here. How did thee make it wi' Hunter, my son?” “Very well sir—settled every thing to my satisfaction; but I'll relate the particulars to you when I return —it's growing late, and I have a little business to do in the city, and then I shall devote the balance of the evening to you;” and stepping into the street I left Horton to disclose his good news at leisure. I wished to purchase some jewels, to adorn the bride and brides-maid likewise—settle with the Doctor and Sarah, and bid my Irish friends adieu. “In going to the Doctor's shop I passed a Jeweller's. While I was looking over and selecting such articles as I thought suitable, a little girl came into the shop, and handed the man a paper with something rolled up in it, and desired him to give her the worth of it in money.— He opened the paper and took out a gold necklace. It came into my head to purchase it as a present for Mrs. Cary. I took the necklace out of his hand, and asked him how much he thought it was worth. Looking at it attentively I beheld my mother's name! “Who gave you this?” said I to the child. “A sick lady, sir, that lives close by my mama's.” “Come and show her to me, litle girl, I will purchase it.” She ran before me to the house of the sick woman. Upon entering the same, I discovered a woman stretched on a wretched bed, pale and shivering with cold, and not a spark of fire in the room. I asked her if she had any wood. She said no. I pulled off my cloak which was lined with flannel, and spread it over her, stepped to the next door, and giving the man of the house some change, begged him for God's sake to get the sick woman some wood, as quick as possible, while I went for a Doctor. “Take some of your own wood, and make her a fire, quick my dear sir, for she appears to be dying.” I then ran for Doctor N—, desired him to go with all speed, telling him where, and that I would meet him there in a few minutes. I next ran to the Irishman's, gave Sarah some change and begged her “to get some wine with all haste, a woman is dying at No. 3, Dutch-street—be quick my dear girl, and follow after me.” She overtook me long before I got there, and was at the place first. When I returned I found a good fire —She had drank some of the wine, but the Doctor said she must have no more, that it was not good for her complaint. “Get her some coffee, Sarah, or tea, something my girl quick as possible.” “I will,” said Sarah. “And some toast too.” The Doctor said he would go and bring her some medicine in the meantime. I told him I would walk with him, that as this was the last evening I should spend in the city, I could not do without his company. Asking the sick woman if “she felt any better?” she said something, but I could not understand her. I put on my cloak and we set out. It was now dark, and all the business I had started upon to do yet. As we proceeded, I asked the Doctor “if the patient was in danger?” He replied “No, if she was well nursed.” “What is the matter?” “She has the —, and she tells me she has had an abortion lately, and with all, she is very low-spirited; she seems as though she would rather die than live.” Wishing to have the business over as quick as possible, I asked the Doctor “to step into the first shop and get the medicine, as my uncle would be looking for us to come to supper.” He went in, got what he wanted, and we returned.— On our way back, I informed him how I happened to to find her, and that “I suspected it was a young woman of good family in Boston, and that if it was the same, she had been seduced by a man whose name was Hunter, under promise of marriage, and left perhaps in this situation;”—observing I would show him a letter to that amount. We entered her abode once more—she was drinking her tea, and seemed greatly revived. While the Doctor was preparing his medicine, writing directions, &amp;c I paid Sarah her wages for attending the sick children (whom she said were well) and gave her something to buy a her a dress, agreeably to promise. I also paid her a month's wages in advance to attend on the sick woman, telling her the Doctor would write to me, and I should know if she failed in her duty; “but I don't think you will, Sarah.” “No sir, indeed I will not, you have been too good to me ever to do any thing to displease you; and I know that if I was to be a brute and neglect the sick woman, you would be very angry, and good right you would have.” 20 I then gave the sick woman what I thought was the value of the necklace, and the Doctor having completed his visit, we took leave. I shook hands with the invalid and with Sarah, giving her another injunction to take care of her charge. As we returned, I called at the jeweller's, took those I had selected, paid him, and proceeded to my uncle's. On our way, I requested the Doctor when the patient got well, if ever she did, to tell her that I was Mary Burlington's brother, and that I knew the necklace to be one that once belonged to my mother, and I did not wish it to go out of my family; and if she chose to return to Boston and would let me know, I would aid her in the undertaking. I requested him “to excuse me to the McCallesters, that I fully intended to call on and take leave of them, but it so happened that I could not.” In short, I begged of him to write to me in the course of a week, and inform me how he succeeded in his efforts to restore the young woman's health; and if he could at any time beguile her of her story, I should be happy to hear it. When we arrived at the Hotel, my uncle said: “What happened too thee, my son, that thee 'staid so long? why supper 's been waiting.” “I beg pardon, uncle, I—” “O, now none o' thy pardons, thee knows 'was thy safety; but I see as thee's got the Doctor, suppose ye'd helped one another if had been any combat. Take some wine and let's go to supper, thae ha' been for us 'dont know how often.” The Doctor and I took a double glass apiece. I asked my uncle if “he thought he could stand the cold to-morrow?” “I don't know—can't be worsted, Jinkins ha' got me a stove to put my feet upon.” I told him “if I could once get him to Philadelphia, he would do well—that there were so many ladies there, that would take pleasure in waiting upon him, and amusing him; and there is your old acquaintance, Slyboots, and here's myself, and Jinkins, and Sambo and Ling[11] [11] A favourite spaniel of my uncle's, which I have hitherto overlooked? —why there will be a large family of us. Uncle you'll have to be the chief or headman, as you are the oldest; they made me the man of the house during the short time I was there. You have been used to command, and I think it will look more in character.” He laughed heartily, and said “Ling would make a much better commander o' a house than he would, wouldn't know stem from stern o' it. Well Doctor, wish 'could go too.” “I wish I could sir, I should be happy to do so, but your son has found another patient that will require all my attention for some time.” “Another patient—who may he be?” said my uncle. “It is a woman, sir. If she recovers, he may truly say he has saved her life—'been one hour later 'twould been all over with her in this world.” I informed him whom I thought it was, and that I had recovered the necklace mentioned in Mary's letter. It may be presumed this part of my conduct met with the warmest approbation from the old gentleman, though he did not express himself after the modern fashion. The Doctor spent the night with us, as we wished to enjoy each other's company as long as possible; he and I slept in the same chamber, and conversed till after one o'clock. I was much pleased with the Doctor—he displayed an intimate knowledge of the world, a highly improved mind, and refinement of manners. In the morning we bid him and New-York adieu—going part of the way by water (which is the usual way) and part by land, taking Horton with us to his exceeding joy. We arrived safe in Philadelphia on the second day, which was the twentieth December, at ten o'clock in the morning.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. Proceeding to Mrs. Cary's, we drove up close under her parlour window—Mary was at the door in an instant. While Jinkins and I were helping my uncle out of the carriage. Wilson followed by Martha and Mrs. Cary, likewise appeared. Wilson met him as he touched the pavement, and after saluting Jinkins, Horton and Sambo, helped him in the house. He was so benumbed with cold, that he could scarcely walk—Mary had him round the neck the moment he was at the threshold of the door, and after `my dear uncle,' and `my dear niece,' she led him, assisted by Martha, to the fire, where Mrs. Cary was placing a chair to the best advantage, by which to command its gladdening warmth. The fire was ample and glowing, and by it sat a pitcher of hot toddy, from which Mrs. Cary filled a glass and presented to my uncle the moment he was seated. “Indeed,” said the old man, “this is kind,” after drinking himself—“thee must drink some too, madam, and Mary here, and 'tother young woman 't helped me in the house, tell 'um to come and drink for better acquaintance.” Martha drew near and giving her hand, asked him how he did? and said that “she was happy to be acquainted with him.” “Miss Cary, uncle.” “How do'st thee do, child? I'm glad to see thee— glad to see thee all.” Mrs. Cary now approached, giving her hand. “Mrs. Cary, uncle,” said Mary again. Finding Miss Watson stood back, I led her up to him (for he was not permitted to rise)—“and here,” said I, “is another friend of yours—Miss Watson, sir.” Miss Watson had become a little affected since I saw her—no wonder that. I next introduced Jinkins separately and severally to the ladies, taking care to give him a gentle twitch on the arm, as I presented him to Miss Watson, giving her a significant glance over his shoulder, at the same time. In this general and joyful meeting, I by no means overlooked the faithful Sambo, who had very sociably drawn up to the fire, amongst us. “Sambo,” said I, “stand forth and pay your respects to the ladies.” He stepped out into the floor, and bowed profoundly to each of them as I pronounced their names. “Now Sambo,” said I, “we will help ourselves to some toddy, as the ladies are so taken with your master, that they have overlooked you and I.” (Wilson had just helped Jinkins.) A general pardon was asked for the omission on the one part, and granted on the other. Indeed, they had not had time, but this was no reason why I should not have my jest. I helped him first. “And now,” said I, “go to the kitchen and set by the fire—when your master wants you we will let you know.” Horton had very prudently betaken himself to the public portion of the house as soon as he got out of the stage. In the meantime the table was set for breakfast in the parlour, and not very far from the place where my uncle was seated. While Mrs. Cary, Miss Watson and the new maid, (as I presumed) were issuing out and in, bearing in dishes, coffee pots, tea urns, &amp;c. Martha and Mary had seated themselves by the old gentleman, holding his hands between theirs, at once to expel the cold, and communicate heat, from their own. Seating myself for the first time, on the other side of Martha, I observed to my uncle, that “he was quite extravagant. I think you had better have two more ladies, one to pull off one gambado, and another to pull off the other, and a fifth one to pull off your great-coat, cloak, &amp;c.” “O go to the deuce. Thee art a vile rogue, thee's only jealous 'cause this young lady's warmin' my hands. I see how the land lies.” Scarcely had the hint been given, when they untied his 20* gambadoes, and disrobed him of his upper garments. After a few minutes delay, and another dram round (Christmas times) we sat down to a hot savoury breakfast. To account for the prompt and very seasonable accommodation which met us upon our arrival, it is necessary to explain, that I had forwarded a note to Wilson, by the driver of the mail stage, that we would be with him to breakfast, and to have us a good fire, and plenty to eat and drink. The family upon receiving this intelligence, declined breakfasting until we came, and we all sat down together. This, if it was not the feast of reason, was truly the feast of ineffable delight! When our spirits became exhilerated by hot drams, hot coffee, &amp;c. (I speak only for myself) I turned my head round to the servant girl, who was standing but a very short distance from the back of my chair, and thus addressed her: “Sweetheart, have you heard anything of a wedding that is to take place shortly, somewhere about here?” She seemed a little isconcerted, looking first at Mary, and then at Mrs. Cary, as if to adapt her answer to what she might discover in their looks; whilst I was leaning with my arm over the back of my chair, waiting for a reply. At length she answered “she had not.” “Thee have not?” said my uncle—“then Charles has dragged me here for nothing. Its very odd that I should hear it at New-York, and know nothing 'bout 'here.— Well, markee Charles, thee don't fool old Tom so again.” Mary's face turned as red as scarlet, Martha with her wonted sweet pensiveness, sat perfectly unconcerned— Mrs. Cary seemed to double her assiduity in plying my uncle with the good things on the board, while Betsey Watson primed up and cast a glance at Jinkins; Wilson I thought seemed to be hurt, and evinced some anxiety for the sensibility of his bride, which had mounted to her eye, and seemed ready to violate every rule of politeness by falling on her plate. I found this would not do. “You shall not be disappointed, sir—I'll get married myself first, that is if I can get any body to have me.” Seeming not to notice the disturbance I had excited in the lovers' feelings. I asked the waiting-maid “if she would have me?” This set them all to laughing, and arrested the falling tear. The rest passed in mutual enquiries after each other's health, and how we had severally enjoyed ourselves, while Jinkins amused the company at intervals, with sundry ludicrous stories, which he invented on my uncle and me. While we were thus agreeably engaged, Ling taking the advantage of our absence from the fire, had stretched himself at full length in front of it, and testified his total exemption from worldly cares in a profound slumber. Breakfast being ended, poor Ling is now interupted. “He must have his breakfast too,” said Mrs. Cary, I dare say he would much rather have slept. Sambo is not forgot, his breakfast is selected from the best of every thing and sent to him by the servant.—The table is removed to make room for us to share alike in the benefit of the fire, before which we seated ourselves promiscuously. Taking out my pocket-book, and opening it with great deliberation, which drew the attention of every one present, I produced from thence the jewels. There were three sets, one a piece for the ladies, and a plain ring for Miss Watson. I waited on Mrs. Cary and laid them in her lap, telling her to take her choice, and devide the ballance between Martha and Mary, adding “that perhaps they might need them ere long.” “Oh how beautiful! how briliant! how rich! prodigious! inimitable!” and all that. After the astonishment subsided, I drew the gold necklace out, and holding it up by one end, asked Mary “if she knew it?” “Do I know it, let me see? It's my necklace!—Oh brother how did you get it? I am delighted you have been to Boston.” “I will tell you some other time Mary, it is sufficient for the present that you have got it.” “Oh brother you are too good!” “Better than you deserve Mary, for acting so foolish at breakfast,” said I, in a low voice. “Dear Charles, forgive me,” said she, and leading me to her chamber, she caught me round the neck and kissing my cheek, fervently, the tears streaming down her's.—Dearest brother forgive me, take the necklace, take every thing, I shall never he happy till you forgive me, said she, while she held me clasped in her arms, with her head reclined on my bosom. I pressed her to my heart, and kissing off the tears, told her “to be a good girl. I forgave her.” “Indeed brother I strove all I could against it, but I was so glad to see my uncle, and to see you return safe, that indeed I don't think I was rightly in my senses, and besides Charles, I was ashamed before Jinkins, you don't know how it hurts a girls feelings to be teazed at such a time. I should not have car'ed a straw had it not been for Jinkins.” In the mean time we had sat down on the side of the bed, all the chairs being occupied, I asked her “if she was ready?” She hung her head, and answered she was. “Mary,” said I, kissing her again, “I am afraid you will behave bad again to-night.” “Indeed I expect as much myself brother.” “You hurt Wilson's feelings to-day.” “I don't care for him, he had no right to be hurt.” “You don't care for him? that's a fine story, I shall tell upon you.” “Dont's care for that either, all that I regret is displeasing you.” “Dear Mary I am not displeased with you, I did speak a little inconsiderate, but my object was to cheer my uncle into spirits. The good old man is subject to fits of melanchoy and distress, on account of his misfortunes:—He still laments the loss of his wife and child, and often weeps bitterly; we must therefore do every thing in our power to drive away those sorrowful reflections, duty and gratitude enjoin this upon us both; he is remarkably fond of lively conversations mirth and jollity, and is one of the best men in the world.” Wilson now entered with permission. I told him, “I had to pet the baby a little, and I suspected he was come on the same errand, that between us both, we had entirely spoiled her.” What do you think she says? (Mary clapped her hand on my mouth, she says she don't care for you.” You did'nt speak truth then, did you my —. I slapped her and bid her go to her uncle and chat with him, I wished to have some conversation with Wilson. When she left us, I asked him “if he was ready?” “Yes,” he said he had been ready these five years. “Then I presume we may prepare as quick as possible;” said I, “has the wine, &amp;c. arrived?” “Yes.” “Well, and where is it, in the cellar hard by, the china?” “Mrs. Cary has taken care of that.” “The sweet meats!” “What the girls have left of them are in the closet.”—They must all be forthcoming at supper, or the old hero will not be pleased.” I directed Wilson to take somebody and have the wine and spirits tapped, whilst I waited on the landlord to order supper, and then we would go and get the license, so that we might have time to dress, &amp;c. Wilson therefore walked with me to the landlord's apartment; as we passed through the parlour, I was much gratified to see Mary sitting on her uncle's knee, with her arms round the dear old man's neck, “Ah said I, uncle you had better whip her, and make her go to work.” “Oh, s'can work some other time child.” I asked him “if he had any objection to my bringing Horton in to see the ladies?—that it seemed like treating him with rather too much contempt to exclude him entirely from our company.” “O yes, to besure bring him in, what dos't ask me for, can't 'ee bring who thee's mind to?” It had always been my opinion, that mildness and clemency are better calculated to reform mankind, than cruelty and harshness. In the present instance it, may be thought by some, that I stretched my maxim rather too far, but I do not think so; if I can by any means effect a reformation in my fellow creatures, those means which are dictated by humanity ought certainly to be attempted in the first place, and in labouring to this end, we ought never to forget that the offender is our brother. Every symptom of a thorough reformation was signally displayed in Horton's appearance.—The keen remorse, and the deep sorrow for his crimes, and his conduct to his wife and children, were indubitably marks of true repentance. Should I abandon him now, all would be lost! No, my object was to attatch him to me by kind treatment, and by every possible means cherish a work so happaly begun. I therefore after giving the necessary directions to the landlord, asked Horton to walk into our room and see my sister, and accordingly he followed me to the parlour. Scarcely had I introduced him to the ladies, when a tap was heard at the front door, it was opened by the girl, and a female entered whom I recognized to be the poor widow whom I had seen at Mrs. Cary's, on the evening of my first arrival in Philadelphia. She seemed somewhat disconcerted upon finding strangers in the house, and obeyed the hospitable invitation of Mrs. Cary, to approach with a slow timid step. We arose from our seats until she was accomodated, but before she reached her chair, Horton sprung to her, and caught her in his arms, exclaiming “my dear Susan have I found you!” She shrieked “Oh heavens!” and appeared for some time bereft of her senses. Horton bore her to a chair, while he supported her in his arms, almost every one in the room were contributing to her restoration. The first words she uttered were, “Never did I expect to see you more Horton, I received a letter that you were dead.” “My dear Susan that was more of my wickedness, do you forgive me? say you forgive me,” said he sobing lamentably. “Where are my children Susan?” “At home,” said she weeping likewise. “Let us go to them Susan,” rising from his chair, “I am not completely happy until I see my dear little babies.” In the mean time, every one in the house was deeply affected, amongst whom, and not the least so was my uncle. His heart was so tender that the smallest thing touched his feelings. The tears which had wet his cheek, being hastily wiped, “never seed the like on't if 'bee'nt as glad, thee'll behave thyself now, I warrant 'would'nt left such a woman for all the wenches in christendom, how dost do madam?” (shaking hands with her as I introduced her) “thou'rt a thousand times too good for 'um.” “You are right sir, she is indeed, ten thousand times too good for me.” “Great mind thee shant have her at all.” When Horton proposed to his wife to accompany him to her dwelling, the old man made out to rise from his chair, advanced up to them and said, “Go Horton and see thy children, and when's done hugin' and bussin', and like o' that thee must bring 'um here, 'want to see 'um; must all come, thee wife must come, 'is goin to be the greatest merry makin' here to night—dos't hear bring 'um all.” “Oh sir,” said Susan we an't fit to come, excuse us if you please sir, I am greatly obliged to you, but we would only disgrace you.” “Never stir if thee shan't come, and thee shall be spliced over again—thee's fit enough.” I told Horton that since it was my uncle's desire, I would be glad if he would bring his family. While we were speaking, Mrs. Horton and the ladies retired to one of the chambers, it seemed that she had brought home some work which she had been employed to do for them, and which she had let fall on the floor at sight of her husband. Whether the object of this cabinet counsel was to settle the affair of the work, or to make arrangements for equipping Mrs. Horton to make her appearance on the approaching evening, my sagacity did not enable me to discover. When the ladies returned to their seats, and Horton and his wife had departed to their dwelling, I snatched an opportunity of shewing Martha the letter I had received from Boston, and not wishing to disturb the company, whom Jinkins was entertaining in his usual style, I took the letters from my pocket without being observed, and sitting down by her, addressed her in terms preparatory for the disclosure I was to make. When I opened the letter which concerned Dupon, I threw my arm over her chair, holding it before her. My uncle exclaimed, “I told thee how the wind lay— should'nt be surprised to see two weddins instead of one. No objections child, if thee and the girl can agree see', may have it all over at once, have it to night if thee's mind to.” This blunt and unequivocal address, came very seasonably to Martha's relief, whose bosom began to beat high at the sight of Dupon's name, and set us both to laughing. “I was just making the proposition to her sir.” “And what do'st say?” “She says we had better postpone it to another time.” “Oh nonsense! just have it over at once, and be done we'it, and we'll crown it in a flowing bowl,” quoth my uncle. “I'll try sir and remove her scruples.” He speaking at the same time with myself apprized Martha that sh' better take 'um while's in the humour, don't meet such offers every day,” giving a significant nod of the head as he closed the sentence. Jinkins being a man of discernment and feeling, poured in upon him a double portion of raillery. “Can't you let the young folks take their time?—by the wars I think you had better be courting yourself, or seeing to get your pumps, you know you are to dance the first reel to night.” “D'ye hear to him!” “We'll send 'um all to old Davy, you know what I mean, Captain.” “Ho Jinkins—I thought 'twas to clear the deck for action.” “Well let the world say what they will Dick, none o'um can't beat thee for lying, and for story tellin' when they's mind to. If the woman-folks mind thee, meaning the ladies present) thee'll have better to mind.” I observed to Martha, that as soon as matters were settled a little, I would go to Liverpool myself, that I wished to see England, and begged of her to shake off that melancholy look, and grace the evening with her smiles, that I could not be happy while I beheld her a prey to grief—“Be happy dear girl, you will know the worst in six months, till then cease to afflict yourself.” Our attention was now attracted by my uncle and his niece. He told her “not to be tellin' stories like Dick, there.” “What's happened between you and Mary, uncle?” “Why I told her she ought to be a puttin' on her garments, d'ye see, and like o' that, and 'says there's no weddin' to be here, and if there was she'd get married in thae she's got on.” “She has time enough to dress, this four hours—it's just twelve—six o'clock is the hour: they certainly can dress in an hour—can't you Martha?” said I, “for I suspect you are to be brides-maid, are you not?” She smiled and answered in the affirmative. I repeated to her what Wilson told me after breakfast, about his being ready this five years. “I suspect you have been ready to wait on Mary, or she on you, since you have been acquainted.” Wilson now made his appearance. I asked him “if he had engaged any other liquors?” He replied, “he had engaged Claret and Champaigne, a couple dozen of each, and if that was not enough, we ought never to drink any more.” I called him aside and enquired if he had formed any acquaintance in the city, it would be well enough to invite a few, it would help to keep up his spirits, and some ladies also, and let us have a little dance to pass off the time. He was acquainted with no lady in the place, except the landlord's wife and daughters. “As good luck as any,” said I, “I will invite them, and you can write a note of invitation to one or two gentlemen, if you know any, and we will send it by the landlord' This being assented to, he desired the maid to furnish him with pen, ink, and paper; and setting down by the 21 fire, he wrote the notes on his knee, and folding them up handed them to me. Once more I must leave the fire and good company.— My business was soon done—the landlord set off with the invitations, directed to C— G— and M— Esqrs. The ladies promised to attend, and leaving a verbal invitation for the landlord, I returned. Wilson smiled, telling me I “had once more to face the cold,” whispering in my ear, “the license,”—and accompanied by Jinkins, we took hats and set out. As we walked to the Clerk's office, it was mutually agreed upon that Jinkins should act as brides-man.— Thus having made the final arrangement, we determined to sit by the fire and enjoy ourselves until it was time to dress. Sambo came in to see his master, and replenished the fire. I gave him a dram, and invented a story about him and the old West India lady, for the amusement of the company. “Humph,” said Sambo, “you always funnin': which ob de young ladies goin' 'get married to-night? which, massa kinfolks?—so many—(looking over them all)— lady—'can't tell one from turra!” This was a solecism to the matter in hand, which was to keep clear of the wedding by all means. “That is her,” said Jinkins, pointing to Martha. “Well, I 'comin' to play da bride—I larn him in Lonnon.” “Well, Sambo, we'll let you know,” said I. Having got rid of Sambo we renewed the conversation, which turned upon subjects most likely to promote good humour, every countenance was animated, and pleasure beamed in every eye—nor did we forget to acquaint Wilson with the happy meeting of Horton and his wife. Thus we as one happy family passed away the time until four o'clock! when something was said about shaving. “I have been shaved once or twice to-day,” (meaning the cold) said Jinkins, “I think that's often enough.” A fire was ordered in the dining-room for us young men to dress in, while my uncle was prohibited from joining us, by the ladies—“He must not leave the warm room—Sambo must come in and perform his toilet,” when the ladies retired for the same purpose. All matters being adjusted, while preparations were going forward for our accommodation, I took out my pocket book for the purpose of looking out a piece of waste paper for my razor, when a bold knocking was heard at the door. It was opened by the maid, and a gentleman of genteel appearance entered the parlour.— He bowed, and was proceeding towards us, when a violent scream issued from all the ladies at once, while they flew to meet him. It was Dupon! Dupon, who rescued assaulted virtue! the man who bore my expiring sister to a place of safety! the man who had in the most delicate manner contributed to her pecuniary aid! Dupon, the orphan's shield, the widow's friend! Such was the man who now entered the room—his genteel manner, his dignified appearance, but above all, his magnanimous soul captivated every power of my mind. His conduct to my sister commanded at once my gratitude, admiration and esteem—new feelings and new duties seized upon my heart, as I fondly embraced him. To pass over the particulars of this scene in silence would be unpardonable: but to do it justice, will not be expected from me. The total absence of ornament, and still less of talent, throughout the narrative, is conclusive evidence that the task is far above my abilities. If the candour of this declaration be questioned by some, it will stand acquitted by others, particularly when they come to learn, what they will very shortly, that this same Dupon, was no other than the long-lost, long-lamented son of my uncle! Leaving it therefore for the reader to imagine what cannot be expressed, I take up the narrative. When I saw him enter the room, I concluded he was one of the young men whom Wilson had invited, and that he had either mistaken the hour, or that something had turned up, to prevent his attendance, and that he was come to make his excuse. While all this was passing in my mind, I was stunned by a universal shout from the women. We were sitting (as may be supposed from our number,) as close to each other, as one chair could be wedged by the side of another, the ladies springing to their feet as they shrieked, just as though they were going to take a fit, attempted to make good their purpose in vain, until Jinkins and Wilson arose to make room. I intended to do the same, but Mary waited not—she put her hand upon my shoulder, as I was in the act of rising and sprung by me, pulling me down again, and dashed my pocket-book with its contents in the middle of the floor. Mrs. Cary came in contact with me next, after treading on my uncle's gouty toc, which made the old man roar, and bolting upright to his feet, he again trampled on the foot of poor Ling, and set him a yelling. In the meantime the name of Dupon was repeated, I don't know how often, which explained the whole matter. I thought the ladies would have torn him to pieces, and I believe he thought so too. Martha, however, (I think) obtained the first kiss—Mrs. Cary was transported out of herself—Mary (I was ashamed of her) acted like one who had lost her reason, while the sedate Martha acted as she always did—in her I saw very little difference, in her actions I saw none, but her countenance was more animated. After the tumult had a little subsided, Dupon was presented to us by Mary, who introduced my uncle first. “Ah,” said the old man, who had continued standing (and whose eye began to run over at the name of Dupon,) “Tip us thy hand, comrade—glad to see thee, glad to see thee—no wonder the wenches made such a squalling.” I don't know how much more he would have said, but he was interrupted by the approach of Wilson, whom Mary introduced with much awkwardness—next Jinkins, and last of all myself. Her gratification on this happy event, may easily be imagined. After mutual expressions of joy and congratulation were exchanged, Dupon was permitted to be seated. He then briefly stated, “that he hoped to have met with me at New-York—that he arrived at Boston about an hour after Mr. S— dispatched the answer to my letters, and set out immediately, thinking to arrive at New-York before I left there. When he came to New-York, we had left it about an hour only; he therefore obtained my address at the Hotel, and set out without delay, expecting to overtake us.” “Why don't give him something to drink? thee lubbers don't think wants it comin' out o' the cold?” said my uncle. This command was instantly obeyed by Sambo, who had just appeared for the purpose of dressing his master. “Well tell thee what, comrade, thee's come in good time, main glad on't, d'ye see, the girl (speaking low) that thee defended so gallantly is goin' to be spliced to-night, and oh, I warrant she's glad on it too, but sort o' bashful, d'ye mind. Well, well, (resuming his common tone) never thought to see thee lad. Charles was readin' o' telling and like o' that: but any how, thee's just the lad after my own heart—Yes, that was my own brother's daughter. Poor Charles! he's dead and gone, but she'll never want a father.” Dupon interrupted by saying— “If I am not greatly mistaken, sir, I have a much higher claim upon your affection, than that of which you speak. Your name is Burlington you say, sir?” “Yes—Thomas Burlington is my name.” “Had you not a son that with his mother narrowly escaped from St. Domingo?” “Yes.” Dupon while this short address passed, took out his pocket-book, opened it, and drew from thence a miniature of my uncle, a pearl necklace, a set of diamond earrings and sundry other trinkets. “Yes,” said he, in great perturbation, looking now at the picture, and now at his father—“it must be,” handing them to the old man—“You know these?” “My—Eliza's!—where is she?—” “Dear father—I am all that remains of your Eliza!” embracing him. It was some time before he could add, “She is no more!” Neither of them spoke for several minutes. I was alarmed—I flew to my uncle—he had fainted! we tore 21* them asunder—all was confusion! the ladies shrieking, Sambo ran to and fro in distraction. I was forced to get angry before I could get a smelling-bottle, or other restorative. Jinkins always cool and collected, soon produced hartshorn, and assisted in chafing the old man's hands and temples—Dupon (or Burlington as he is henceforth to be called,) broke from Wilson and hung over his father, whilst the tears ran down his manly cheeks. I intreated him to retire and compose himself: that his father's nerves were weak, and his feelings so easily excited, it would be dangerous to permit him to indulge them just now. When the old man recovered, the first word he uttered was, “Where did my Eliza—?” “Oh uncle, say no more about it to night, you have found your son whom you never expected to see, and that's enough. You act childish—how do I, that lost father, mother, and every thing else?—how does hundreds, thousands others, that lose wives, and husbands? Come let us all be merry to-night—I'm sure you ought to be so upon the recovery of your son, and such a son.” “Leave him to me,” said Jinkins: “if I hear any more snivelling and piping, I'll out with the Algerine.” This set my uncle to laughing, and the party resumed their cheerfulness. In the meantime Thomas Burlington had seated himself by Martha. Sitting down by my uncle, I in a low voice, let him into the secret of his son's attachment to her, telling him he might see how the land lay now, with a view to divert his mind from recurring to the old subject. I informed him that his son had been long engaged to Martha, and if he had no objection and they were willing, it would be well enough to let them get married to-night, and let one frolic suffice for both. “Ah!” said the old man aloud, “sets the wind that way? od zucks, and so we will—shall be all spliced together to-night. What do'st say to that, my son? do'st hear? I understand as that's thy sweet-heart, shall marry her to-night.” Getting up from his seat and going to where they sitting—“What do'st say? do's say she'll have thee? do's say she'll be spliced to-night?” “She has not said yet, sir.” “O, silence gives consent—she's willing enough, 'can see by the lee o' her eye—shiver my limbs, if 'knows how to woo; lay thy arms round her neck and give her a bass, an't had one so long too,” laying his son's willing arm round Martha's neck—“that's the way, now squeeze her up close.” For Martha's sake I proposed that we should all go and dress, “otherwise the parson would be here before we were ready.” Addressing my new cousin, I invited him to accompany us, and participate in the requisite preparation, particularly as he was one of the brides-grooms; he smiled and arose rather reluctantly I thought, and took the precedence in walking to the dining-room, where, as already mentioned it was agreed we should dress. I dropped behind a moment to request Mary to let Martha know I was seriously disposed to urge the union of her and my cousin that evening, and should name it to young Burlington, whom I had no doubt would readily acquiesce—that I had already obtained my uncle's consent, and finally I should expect Martha to comply, and without waiting for Mary's answer, I proceeded to join my friends. Whilst we were employed in dressing, &amp;c. I ordered a cold check for Thomas, as dinner was out of the question; and begged of him to avoid by every means, any further conversation with his father on the subject of his mother's fate, until the old gentleman should gain sufficient strength of mind to hear it, and recommended the propriety of imparting the subject to him by degrees. He thanked me in the warmest terms, and began to express his obligations. “Say nothing about obligations, dear Thomas,” said I, “it more properly belongs to me to make acknowledgments of that nature; but we must waive every thing of the sort for the present, and as time presses, you will excuse me dear Tom, for the liberty I have taken; if I have acted right, you will place it to the credit of the debt I owe you, if I have done wrong, have the goodness to forgive me.” “No ceremony,” said he—“let me know what you wish.” “There are none here but our friends. Jinkins I may say is your brother, and Wilson is soon to be mine; briefly, I have learned that you and a certain young lady whom I need not name, have been long attached to each other; your father knows it and approves of the match: in short, he wishes you to consummate the nuptials this evening.” “Heavens! are you serious?” “I am.” “My generous friend! my noble father!” was all the reply he was able to make. “If you therefore consent, you have no more to do but get ready as quick as possible, your father being anxious it should take place, when Mary and Wilson have the knot tied, you will have but three-quarters of an hour to prepare; six o'clock is the hour, so you had better change your clothes and walk with me to obtain your license. Wilson had got his as you arrived, and in the meantime, if you resolve to do so, you had perhaps (though you will act as you please) better consult Martha.” Jinkins observed laughing, “it would be a good joke enough to carry the thing so far, and the bride not be willing.” Burlington smiled at the remark, which seemed (at least I took it so) to indicate little doubt. When we were dressed, Burlington and I took our hats and proceeded. On gaining the parlour we found not a single lady: they had retired to dress. I told my cousin I could settle it for him, and going to their chamber door, told them I wished to speak with Mary. She replied “I am dressing.” “Can't you come to the door?” said I, “I want to have a peep at that trimming.” “The plague take you, for you torment me to the last moment,” said Mary. She drew near the door, which she opened with great caution to the distance of an inch, and asked what I wanted. I replied, loud enough for Martha to hear, “that I wished to know, or at least my cousin did, whether Martha would consent to consummate their marriage that evening; and was now waiting for an answer, that he might get ready.” “Yes brother, tell him she is willing—She pretends she is not willing to be married so soon, but it is all pretence with her, I know—she would not miss it for the world.” “Shame on you Mary,” said Martha. “Shame on you to be so silly, when you have been dying for him these two years:—So tell him to get ready, I'll be security for Martha.” In the meantime Thomas had taken the opportunity of obtaining his father's consent, as he had stated to me on our way to get the license. During our walk, I intimated that I promised myself infinite pleasure in his society, and much gratification in learning the particulars of his ilfe, which seemed to involve a great deal of mystery, particularly that of his name; but the present opportunity was quite too short, besides, “my spirits as well as your own, are not sufficiently composed.” He briefly observed that his mother died in a few days after the massacre of St. Domingo of the fright, that she never recovered her senses sufficiently to tell her name, or to converse rationally upon any subject—the second day after the ship left St. Domingo a Mr. Dupon, (who had likewise escaped from the Island, after having his wife and children massacred before his eyes by the negroes) went down, perhaps, for the purpose of seeing who my mother was, and found her in a swoon, lying on the floor, while I (then about a year old) was sitting by her crying. “He, thinking she was entirely dead, picked me up to convey me out of the way until she was shrouded, but sending one for that purpose, she had come to: but cotinued to rave until the next day, when she died; that Dupon had reared him, gave him his own name, and treated him with all the tenderness of a son, that he was now dead; but during his illness, which preceded his death, he disclosed to him for the first time, that he was not his father, and gave him the jewels that I had seen, which was the clue to the discovery of my real father, but which would not of themselves, perhaps, ever have led to the discovery, had it not been for other co-incidents.” We now arrived at Mrs. Cary's, where we found Horton and his two oldest little girls; one of them (our old acquaintance) was sitting on Wilson's knee, dressed in style. The other one was sitting on the knee of her father. Upon enquiry I found Mrs. Horton was in the chamber with the ladies. It was now within half an hour of the trying time: taking out my watch, I showed it to Wilson and my cousin, telling them their time was short, and asked them “if their hearts did not go pitty patty?” “No,” was the answer. “Faith! I would not like to be so near mooring for life,” said Jinkins. Wishing to fill up the time with some amusement, I asked Jinkins to favour us with the “Down Hill of Life.” He had got through but one verse when our guests arrived, and soon after them, the Parson. At length the long-looked for and much-desired six o'clock came. It had been intended. I suspect, that Martha should attend my sister, as Walter Scott would say, “on this memorable occasion;” but what is to be done now? Martha is a bride herself, forsooth! then Betsey Watson or the landlord's daughter must officiate. I did not care how they managed it. Making a sign to Jinkins we hunted up the brides.— I led Martha and Jinkins led up my sister. They were soon united by the Parson, he being very agreeably suprised at receiving two fees instead of one. It is a question with me whether he ever made as much in so short a time.—And so endeth the twenty-second Chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. Here again I expect to be blamed for omiting “the timid step, the down-cast look, the scarlet blush, the snowy dress, &amp;c. &amp;c., how Mrs. Cary was dressed and what Miss Watson had on; and how they behaved and how they looked; also the superb supper, the merry dance, the comic tale, the cheerful song, and a great many &amp;c's.” But these particulars I have thought proper to leave to the imagination. It would require very little thought or reflection to swell them into a mighty long story; but for this I have not time—suffice it to say, that every thing was conducted with great decorum, and to the infinite satisfaction of all parties; at least I have never heard any thing to the contrary. Jinkins and I, having slept together, were up before any of the family. By the family I mean all appertaining to our own party. It was the first opportunity I had had to enquire “how he liked his sweet heart?” “He didn't know—he was not in such a haste about things, he was not so eager to leap under the hatches.” I told him I thought he was perfectly in the right to take his time in a matter of that importance, that it was nothing more than a jest of mine—Though Miss Watson was really a fine girl, well informed, chaste, industrious, and possessed of much generosity and good nature; she had been reared by Mrs. Cary, from a child; and such was her gratitude to her that she had never forsaken her when she became reduced to indigence and every species of distress. With such conversation as this, I essayed to make an impression on the open hearted Jinkins—leaving the matter to rest there for the present, I asked him what he thought of a match between my uncle and Mrs. Cary? He laughed heartily at this, saying, “I was all-determined to go on with the match-making business—why don't you hunt a match for yourself?” I replied, “I had been crossed in love, and therefore intended to live a bachelor the remainder of my days.” My cousin making his appearance, the conversation between me and Jinkins concerning match-making, was dropped. I was pleased to have an opportunity of settling the mode of communicating his adventures to his father, and told him, “it would never do to relate that part of it which related to his wife's catastrophe, in its fullest extent—it would serve no purpose except that of exciting his feelings.” Upon submitting the matter to Jinkins, who was “a much better judge than I,” he declared decidedly against it; “it would go near to taking his life.” Thomas said “he had intended to soften the thing as much as possible.” Finally it was concluded between us three that the subject of his adventures should form that day's amusement. He was to commence after breakfast, and no other subject was to interfere until he was through. This point being settled, some desultory conversation filled up the time until breakfast, in which, however, I was much pleased to find that my new relation possessed much general knowledge. His conversation, so far as I was able to judge, proved him to be a man of business and reflection—easy in his address, and seemed rather to lack culture than genius; he possessed enough, however, for the common concerns of life. In his stature, complexion, and features, he resembled his father. He wanted little, if any, of being six feet in height, stout, and well made, his hair a shining brown, his eyes deep blue, and very expressive, complexion fair, his face round and full, his cheeks blushing like the rose —he was in mourning. When the party assembled for breakfast I gave them to understand the pleasure that awaited them, and in the meantime directed a good fire to be furnished in the parlour. When breakfast was over we adjourned thither, it being the best adapted to the size of the company. Here was sometime lost before we could be regulated according to our mutual wishes. Mrs. Burlington, as we are henceforth to call Martha, and Mrs. Wilson, expressed as much as though they would rather sit by my uncle, than elsewhere. I gave up to them, and after they were disposed of, the rest were soon seated. I contrived however to get Jinkins and Miss Watson together, and it had so much the appearance of accident that nobody in the world would have suspected it was design. Mrs. Cary sat in the corner, as we term it; I took my seat next to her, and pointed the next seat out to Thomas, Wilson sat next to him, and Jinkins on the next to Wilson's left, and next to Mary, between whom and Martha sat the Commodore. Whatever of confidence, whatever of approbation, and those concomitants which give to life its true relish, might be said to reign in complete fruition throughout this happy assembly. Myself, perhaps, could form the only exception, but had I not given in to the general joy, I had deserved to be miserable forever. After a few minutes hesitation my cousin began as follows: “You will not expect me, on this occasion, to relate those incidents which make so great a part of every one's childhood and youth: and it may be as well to remark, in the first place, that until within the last two years, my life has been wholly exempt from the marvelous. “The first thing I recollect, was, that I loved no one but my papa. (as I always called Mr. Dupon,) Betty, (the house-keeper,) and a lap-dog, called Pug, and that my papa bought me a little green hat, with which I was infinitely pleased. “I remember likewise of making my escape very often from Betty and running after Mr. Dupon into the street, when he went out. He would often pick me up in his arms and take me with him, buying every thing for me that he thought would please me. “At length I became old enough to go to school; here was a bitter task indeed! I rarely submitted without a cry—nothing could hire me, no reward could reconcile me to this drudgery. 22 “I made but little progress in learning, until I became old enough to see the necessity of improvement. Mr. Dupon however spared no pains to impress me with the need of instruction, all his leisure hours were devoted to this all important end. “As I was designed for the mercantile business, my education was limited to the English language and a perfect knowledge of book keeping; I did however make some progress in the mathematics. “As my education advanced, Mr. Dupon laboured to instil into my mind the principles of virtue, honour and justice. “When I was fifteen years of age, he sent me supercargo to Kingston, Jamaica, merely to make me acquainted with business. When I returned home he expressed much satisfaction at my conduct. “His approbation was the most pleasing recompence he could have bestowed upon this first essay of my boy hood, no words could express the pleasure I felt on the occasion. “He sent me again, and again, my conduct still met his warmest approbation. “He then ventured to trust me with an extensive and valuable cargo, consigned to Boston, in which city he was concerned with one of the most respectable houses in the place. In this undertaking I was equally fortunate. “I had now become pretty well acquainted with trade, and relieved Mr. Dupon considerably from that toil and application to business to which he had necessarily been subject, and under the pressure of which his health evidently began to sink. “In my second voyage to Boston, it was that I had the pleasure to render those services to her whom I now have the happiness to call my relation. “This act of mine will be ever dear to me, (here he was much agitated easting a look at Martha) he resumed as it is associated with a circumstance, the first and last object of my existence. “The happy hours I spent at Mrs. Cary's, I pass over, it will be enough to remark that I protracted the time of my departure for England, far beyond the dictates of prudence. “At length I received a letter from my father, requesting me to repair forthwith to Jamaica, dispose of my cargo, re-load as quick as possible and return home, that he was in bad health and needed my presence. This occasioned my sudden departure from Boston. “Mrs. Cary I fondly hope will forgive me, who was but a stranger, for my presumption at my departure; in the action to which I allude, I was influenced by the purest motives, and the interest I took in her happiness. I thought it would enable her to gratify that benevolent diposition I had witnessed in her, particularly to Miss Burlington. I now have come to an interesting part of my story. “After my acquaintance with Mrs. Cary's family, I continued to visit her regularly, which at length subjected me to the impertinent raillery of my acquaintances. At first I paid no attention to what I considered beneath the notice of a gentleman, but it very soon assumed a character of another and more exceptionable nature. I heard insinuations false as they were painful to me. I was in a strange place, amongst people of whose principles and character I had little knowledge, and to tell the naked truth, this injurious report prevailed principally amongst the females, which put it out of my power to combat it, or I certainly would. “I curst them in the bitterness of my heart, and on all occasions defended the reputation of Mrs. Cary's family. I was not, however, aware of the extent and malignity of the report, at the time of my leaving Boston. “I, for some time previous to my departure, was less frequent in my visits, which proceeded from a desire to afford slander less grounds for suspicion; and it is with much sorrow I learn (through Martha) the deep distress into which they were plunged on my account, after my departure—but you will excuse—(his emotion again disconcerting him.) “Upon my arrival in Liverpool, I found Mr. Dupon partially recovered from a dangerous fit of illness; he was overjoyed to see me, and mildly reporved me for staying so long, adding that had he died of his late illness great loss would have been sustained—he meant the concern. “I was truly afflicted at this distressing intelligence, and have never forgiven myself for the risk I had incurred of losing the best of fathers, as he certainly had always been to me. The disorder in which I found the firm, my father's ill health, and the unprotected situation of my acquaintances in America, combined to render me very unhappy. “After a long consultation, in private with Dupon, respecting the means most proper to redeem the concern from difficulty, I left him and set about this arduous task. After putting the business in the best train which it admitted, I hastened to my father, whose complaint seemed to assume a more favourable appearance. Yet though there was much to hope, there was much fear, and he intimated something about making his will. “I expressed myself to him in terms of opposition to this intimation, from no other motive than that I thought it would tend to depress his spirits, adding that of course I could be no loser, his only child; and finally I treated the subject with perfect indifference. “Ah,” said he, “Ferdinand, you know not what situation you might fall into, were I to die intestate.” “Dear father,” said I, “you speak mysteriously— what can you mean?” “My child,” said he, “prepare yourself for something that will astonish and distress you. “You lost your mother in your infancy—I supplied her place to the utmost of my power—I nursed you on my knee—I cherished you in my bosom—but you are not my son!” “Had the earth opened to swallow me, had the final dissolution of nature arrived, it would not have filled me with more amazement. I was speechless some time—a variety of feelings rushed upon me: my mind was a complete chaos. “Not your son? thought I, whose son am I, then? who was my mother? who is this man who has reared me so tenderly? what motive, what am I to him? I felt partly annihilated. “Mr. Dupon was so much affected that it was with much difficulty he proceeded. “I thought it best to inform you of this, indeed I always intended to do so, and perhaps it is as well now as any time.” “Oh, sir! haste to tell me who I am!” “That I know not, dear Ferdinand—your mother escaped from St. Domingo in the same ship with myself, but she was never in her senses sufficiently to tell who she was. The second day after we left the Island I went down to see how she was doing; she was very ill. I took the child from her, (which was yourself,) and she died the next day: she had no domestics with her, nor any one who could give any intelligence whatever. She was without trunks, papers, or any thing which could lead to a discovery. “I preserved her jewels, and a miniature, which was round her neck, and which I presume must be your father's. The richness of the jewels, and her attire, bespeaks you of no ignoble birth, but from them I could make no discovery of your name, as nothing but the initials of your father and mother's name appeared on them, and I called you by my own name. “Having lost a wife and two lovely children, in St. Domingo, I felt for your distressed situation, and concluded that your father had fallen in the awful massacre in which my wife and children had been cut off; and I am still of that opinion. But if this should not have been the case, the survivors were scattered over different parts of the world, and the difficulties of obtaining information were so many, that I never exerted myself to get information on the subject. “But if your father should be alive, the miniature and jewels will serve as a clue, for I have little doubt but the miniature is his, from your resemblance to it.” “I asked him if he ever heard any enquiries respecting me. “He replied that he saw numerous advertisements, and many of the signatures corresponded with the initials on the miniature, which rather served to embarrass the discovery. 22* And to tell you the truth, dear Ferdinand, and it is a truth you can well vouch for, I was too much attached to you—” Here my cousin became too much affected to proceed. I proposed to drop the subject until after dinner—when he resumed— “I have little more to add—the scene that succeeded is beyond description, I felt as though I had lost a father, and he as though he had lost a son. I fell on his neck— he embraced me tenderly and proceeded— “My motive for passing you as my own child may be attributed to a desire of screeing you from the ill nature of my brother's wife, who would have stopped at nothing to effect your destruction, had she known the truth. It therefore passed that you alone escaped the massacre in which my wife and children were cut off. She being now dead you have nothing to apprehend. I mean to divide my estate equally between you and my niece, and as she is young I wish you to act as her guardian.” “The will was drawn agreeably to his desire, and in the way I just mentioned. Finally he never recovered, although he lived eleven months after this circumstance, and as soon as I could finally arrange my business, I set sail for the United States. “Being one day in a public room, previous to my departure, I was engaged in looking over an old file of news papers, endeavouring to obtain some information from them on the subject of my family. While thus employed, I overheard an old Tar observe, “he is the very image of him, poor soul!—As I was saying, he never held up his head afterwards—about the same size too: ah, that was a dreadful piece of work!” “Upon turning round I discovered that he and the person he was addressing were both looking at me. “Was it I, that you had an allusion to just now sir?” “I was just telling my comrade here, that you had put me in mind of my old commodore when he was a young man.” “What was his name, sir?” “His name was Thomas Burlington, and a braver man never stepped between stem and stern.” “Where did you know him, sir?” “I knowed him every where; we have been over the whole world together. I was just telling my comrade that the poor soul lost his wife by the d—n savage negroes in St. Domingo. May I ask your name?” “I told him I did not know my real name, being found by a gentleman when young, and have never since discovered who I was. Without troubling you with his tedious narrative, it is sufficient to say, that his relation agreed with my own story so near, that I determined to proceed to Havanna, where he informed me he had left Commodore Burlington. When I arrived there I learned that he had just sailed for New-York. The rest you are acquainted with.” My uncle wiping his eyes, said—“thee hast seen some squalls, my son, as well as thy father, but 'trust thee is laid up now But after all, that was a noble fellow, that Dupon, I can't blame thee to bewail his loss.” But seeing that his son was much affected, “let's have something to drink and go to dinner.” After dinner we all assembled again in the parlour, and to gratify Sambo, he was allowed to relate to his young master his share in his preservation. He exulted very much in his usual way. The evening was spent in the most agreeable manner, the conversation being enlivened with with wit and sprightliness, until after supper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. We had scarcely seated ourselves around the fire, when a stranger of tolerable appearance entered the room. After bowing to the company, he advanced to Mrs. Cary and thus addressed her: “Long life to you, Mrs. Cary, how do you do? Well, I suppose I'm too late for the wedding—well, I declare to you, that I tried to be here, but them divilish Fowlers and one c—d thing or another happened, that I couldn't be here any sooner. But it's no odds, as I suppose the girl is married, anyhow.” “They are both married, Mr. Sullivan.” “The d—l they are!” Mary and Martha now presented themselves; he wished them joy, and shook hands with them. But Mary not being content with his salutation, held her face near to his. “Why, an't you going to kiss me, Mr. Sullivan?” “No, shame the one of you will I kiss.” “Nor me neither?” said Martha. “No, nor you nather.” “Now I'm mortified,” said Mary. “Divil a hair I care. Who do you think wants to kiss you after them fellows been slavering your mouth? I'd know who the mischief they are. Get me something to eat, and something to drink too, for I'm both tired, hungry and dry. Just bring it in here, and set it on this little table, for I want to be after talking with Mrs. Cary, d'ye hear—now don't be calling any body and making a rout about it, just bring a bit of something yourself—I'm right hungry, I never broke my fast since morning, for as soon as I got home, I came right on.” The two ladies withdrew and after a few minutes absence returned, with cake, cold ham and a fowl; to this was added wine, and all placed on a small table near the fire, between him and Mrs. Cary. After things were settled to his mind, he sat down with his side to the table and his face towards the fire. Drawing out a red silk handkerchief and spreading it on his knee, he told them to go about their business—they insisted upon waiting upon him, but he bid them “go along to your husbands, and let them kiss you in my stead. Go sit down, I want to talk with Mrs. Cary; stop, let me see what we have here,” taking up the decanter, “pretty good,” (tasting it) “this will do, you may go sit down,” said he, addressing Mrs. Cary, while he regaled himself as follows: “I have been upon thorns to see you ever since I got out of that cursed place. I do'n know what I could be about when you called at the prison, sure you must a gone like the wind; I was astonished when they told me.” “I waited for you,” said Mrs. Cary, “some time, as I knew it would gratify you; indeed, I would have waited longer, but was afraid the gentlemen would return.” “Well, it's no odds, all well enough; I suppose there wasn't much time lost, before I heard the news. That cursed crature (Lord forgive me) comes to the prison with one of her smiles upon her countenance— “Well, what do you think, Mr. Sullivan?” “What about?” says I. “Don't you think two great gentlemen have been and took Mrs. Cary and the girls off to the Mansion House in three fine carriages, he, he, he. What do you think of that? he, he, he. They helped them into the carriage just as if they'd been the greatest ladies in the land, he, he, he.” “Curse her giggle! Mrs. Cary, I was going to observe that I love a modest female as I do my life, 'don't care who they are, nor where they come from. By all that's sacred, I'd lay down my life for any female, rather than see her in distress or imposed upon. I'm sure you know that, but to to see such a brute as that, she is a disgrace to her sex—and there she'd smile, and Mr. Sullivan, and Mr. Sullivan and he, he, he. I hope the Lord will forgive me, for God knows I never hated any body so cordially Why, why didn't,” said he, stuttering as he grew warm in the cause, “the d—n crature show all this kindness to you who stood in need of it? No, but she could give a laugh and turn up the whites of her eyes on me. Did you take notice when company would come into her room, what a difference? I always could tell a male from a female visitor, from the giggle; the d—l a bit would she laugh when a woman would come in. I'd hear them talk jest, but whenever a gentleman would come in, he, he, he—blast her smiles I wanted none of them: it makes me so mad, well, d'ye mind the time she made her husband lock you up and abuse you, Lord if I didn't want to kill her, then there's no smoke, and wanted to freeze you to death, and wouldn't let the girls bring you any thing good to eat. Oh heavens! and this is a free country! And her husband, poor pitiful soul, but it's well enough—she'll give him the child to mind and away she'll go over town—race here and race there; well, it don't signify, I won't say what I was going to say—can you ever forgive her?” “Oh, yes, Mr. Sullivan, don't think of her, don't vex yourself—she is unworthy your resentment.” “My dear madam I know she is.—Well, I believe I will take your advice.—Where are you Mary?” “Here I am.” “Where is Martha? I want to know what sort o' looking folks these are ye have got: I suppose it's some o' these gentlemen sitting here?” “Yes sir—you would not suffer me to make you acquainted.” “Well, go along now and bring them forward.” We all advanced up to him, and were severally introduced: my uncle shook him cordially by the hand, “thou art a hearty soul—glad to be acquainted with thee.” I was struck with the appearance of this extraordinary man from the moment he entered the house. His easy manners, and that perfect unconcern with which his conduct was marked in the presence of so numerous a party of strangers, bespoke a man of great independence of mind. Perfectly at his ease and unembarrassed, he received the salutations of the company. His countenance was strongly marked with vivacity, good nature, and benevolence. He was of middling stature, inclining to robust—handsome, though in the decline of life. He was clad in a short coat, commonly called a sailors jacket, with ferret strings. This was carelessly thrown open, and partially displayed a fine, and very neat ruffle shirt. From the time he entered until we were called on to receive his address not a word was uttered, the profoundest silence reigned throughout, the ladies excepted. I was afraid to breathe or stir, lest I might lose a single word. Our admiration increased as the conversation advanced, between him and Mrs. Cary; but it was effectually secured when we found him the warm friend of our idol. The more he gained upon us the more we felt our own inferiority. After our introduction we retired to our seats without offering to interrupt the conversation. “Mary,” said this Irishman, “get us something stronger, this wine is too cold—don't be a hesitating, many a time I've waited upon you. I intend you shall wait upon me now.” Mary lost no time in producing some brandy. As she sat the decanter on the table and was removing the remains of the repast, he looked her in the face with the best natured smile, and asked, “you havn't forgot when old Patrick (meaning himself) used to bring you wood, and make you a fire after working hard all day. Many's the time Molly would send the children to-bed with a piece, and slip the milk for their suppers into my hand and say “here Patrick, take this over to widow Cary's, the girls want it worse than we do—ay, do you mind that, Mary?” “I do sir, and trust that I ever shall remember it.” “That's a good girl; you know I do not care a curse about a bit of a supper, and all these things, but it does me good to see a little gratitude left in the world yet —it's not the value of a benefit I care about, but the way it is conferred. “Ah, and Mrs. Cary too, sold her finery to redeem me out of prison. Well, it'll be all one a thousand years hence. But, I'm mad at you that you didn't tell Mister —, what's his name, Mary's brother, what you were saving your money for? why but you told him you wanted a little sum for a friend, he'd a given it to you, I'll warrant, and a keep'd your duds of clothes.” Mrs. Cary blushed exceedingly at this artless and unexpected disclosure, and chiding him mildly for telling tales about her, said, “Now I shall get a scolding from Mr. Burlington.” “Oh, blame the odds, what he says. Martha bring me something to put under my head. I'll just lay down here on the carpet, (throwing himself down) I'm afraid you will be jealous of Mary if I don't make you wait on me too. There, I just want to dry my feet by the fire, I'm tired too. “I've walked to day—let me see,—ten, eight and two is ten, twenty miles this good day; and do you think Fowler hadn't the impudence to deny the payment till I showed him his own recaipte, (Martha placed a pillow under his head) ah, that's my darling; Miss say little and think the more after all Mary's ding-dong about her sweet heart, I think you got the handsomest man at last. How did it happen, Martha? I never heard a breath of it till to night, you must be a snake in the grass.” “Oh, sir, you know still water is deep?” “Faith! I believe so. Well, now talk away as fast as you please, I'm not agoing to sleep, I can hear all your say-so's. Where is them baby clothes, Mary, that you are agoing to send to Molly? ye needn't be sniggering and laughing, I'm sure Molly tould me you were agoing to send her something—I hate to see this mock-modesty, Mary, in a girl of sense too.” I told Mary she ought to be as good as her word to Mrs. Sullivan. She whispered to him something that could not be heard, when he proclaimed aloud— “Your very bad all at once—you'll have good luck if you ain't making some yourself 'fore long.” My uncle could maintain silence no longer, he roared out, “he was the gallantest fellow he had seen since he cast anchor.” “I don't know what you're all laughing about.” “Where do'st live? we'll go and see thee to-morrow, Mary and Martha too—she shall bring thy wife what she promised, herself; and if it's a boy call it Thomas, —never stir if 'wouldn't rather go and see thee than the King of England—he ain't half so clever.” “Faith! and you may well say that, without anny of it's being the truth at all at all. “But you havn't tould me, Martha, where you picked up this blue-eyed boy. I suppose now you'll hardly spake to a poor fellow like me.” “God forbid, Mr. Sullivan, that I should ever forget your kindness.” “Och, now, none o' your palaver, just let us all thank God for his mercies, and laugh and sing, and be merry —such a day as this don't come every day.” “Mr. Sullivan,” said Martha, “you will not let any body talk but yourself. I was going to tell you that I had become acquainted with Mr. Burlington sometime before I left Boston, that he was then known by another name, and has proved to be a cousin of Mary's, and the son of this gentleman, pointing to my uncle, who thought he was lost at sea when a child. Nor did he know any better until yesterday.” “Then there was double joy as well as a double wedding—Well if that's the case I'll get up; it won't do to be lying down here like a baist.” He got up and told Mary to fill up the glasses, he'd have to pledge the strangers in a glass or two. Mary filled the glasses, and we all advanced to the table, and drank to the health of this noble Irishman. “And where will we find a match for you sir?” said he, addressing himself to me, “if seem that you have a helpmate to find, and this young man,” pointing to Jinkins. I told him “I would trust to Providence, and as for Mr. Jinkins, I thought he was very suitably accommodated, if he could bring over Miss Watson.” Looking first at my uncle and then at Mrs. Cary, he said, “He was going to say something, but he believed he would let it alone.” “Oh, tell what thee's a mind to, I love to hear thee talk o' all things,” said my uncle. 28 “Well then, I was just going to say that your honour, and Mrs. Cary here, had better make a bargain for better for worse.” I told him I was just thinking of that myself. The old man laughed and said— “The lady would have a bad bargain o' it, to take such a crazy old vessel as I be in tow; but if so be she had a mind to come to, he had no objection to lowering sail.” The young folks laughed immoderately, when Wilson, wishing to change the subject, asked Jinkins to give us “Life let us Cherish,” observing that I must get my flute, for he longed to hear Jinkins sing. “Neither the ladies or my new cousin had heard him yet. Jinkins acquitted himself with his usual taste and sung several other songs, in which we joined. Ferdinand sung, Wife, Children, and Friends, with great applause. It was now the Irishman's turn to sing, and when requested, he began without further solicitation, Barney let the Girls alone, which set the house in a roar. Being solicited for another song, he gave us, “Langolee,” putting on all the brogue he could bring to bear, as my uncle has it. By this time it grew late and Sullivan arose to depart, when my uncle said— “—Shan't till thee take thy allowance—Shiver my limbs if thee bain't the heartiest tar amongst us.— Thou need'st not think of tarrying till we have had some more vocal singing. “I love thee because thou was kind to thae women folks.” He however begged off, and drank with the old man, who, holding him by the hand, bid him—“Tell his wife we'd all be to see 'um to-morrow,” putting his left hand into his pocket in the meantime—the rest may be guessed. Wilson and I waited upon him to the street door, and upon taking leave of him each of us put a bank note into his hand, and begged he would oblige us so far as to present it to his wife, and tell her that we would call on her in the morning if nothing happened. “The plague a hair I care for money, but it will plaise Molly, and so I'll kape it.” We pressed his hand and he departed. The company being disposed to retire, we separated for the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXV. Next morning I drew Mary aside and requested an explanation of the conversation over night. “What did Sullivan mean by Mrs. Cary's selling her clothes to take him out of prison?” As I understood it, Mary seemed averse to the expla nation, but seeing I was serious she gave me the following brief, but appalling, elucidation. She said “that Sullivan was put in prison on Mrs. Cary's account, that he had become her security for two hundred dollars, which she owed for rent, that he had been a great friend to them since they came to Philadelphia, and had it not been for him they must have perished, or resorted to the poor-house, that they had all been sick, and this man happened to find them in that situation, and brought a Doctor to attend them at his own expence.” “Don't don't tell me any more Mary if you do not wish to drive me mad, I cannot hear it. But why did not you, if Mrs. Cary felt a delicacy in asking Wilson, why did not you ask him for the money, and not suffer Mrs. Cary to part with her clothes?” “They all felt a delicacy.” “Nonsense! mock delicacy that was truly. Why did you not tell me before I left you?” “You left us so soon brother—nor have you heard the worst; Martha, Betsey, and myself, parted with great part of the things you bought, or what is the same thing, and had it not been for the money you sent us from New York, Sullivan would not have been out of prison yet.” “Shocking! and what became of his family whilst he was in prison?” “They did ill enough until you came, and then Mrs. Cary sent them victuals every day.” “I was wrong, I ought to have left money with her, I see I am a novice—and where had this man been yesterday?” “He went to pay the balance of the rent to a man who lives in the country, one Fowler.” “And why did you let him walk?” said I, losing all patience. “You are ungrateful Mary, and unworth—” I was going to say, unworthy of my regard, when she replied— “That she and her friends did give him money to bear his expences, but probably he reserved it for the use of his family.” “What did Mrs. Cary mean, in her reply to Sullivan about fearing to wait?” “She ran to the prison,” said Mary, “on the evening of your arrival in the city, while you and Wilson were absent to apprize Sullivan of the good news, with a view of cheering his spirits, and reviving his hopes of relief.” “And the woman he spoke of?” “She was,” returned Mary, “the constable's wife, who had arrested Mrs. Cary for the debt, and being left in her care whilst in custody, and while her husband was absent on other business, she treated Mrs. Cary with great cruelty and harshness. “But as it is over brother, and we are happy, don't be poisoning our happiness or ruffling your temper by investigating past misfortunes.” “I will take your advice, dear Mary, and am prouder of you than ever. I saw last evening by the reception given to Sullivan, that he had been your friend.— But what became of the relation mentioned in your letter from Boston, why did he not befriend Mrs. Cary?” “Oh, don't enquire, brother, he was dead, and his family treated her with scorn and contempt; do let us—” “I have done.” After dinner we got the Commodore and the ladies into carriages, and proceeded to our new friend's, the Irishman's—Ling and Sambo walking together in the rear, whilst Jinkins, Ferdinand, and myself, walked in the van. I wished to have left Jinkins at home to keep Miss Watson company, but the old man would by no means consent to go without him; so ardent was his attachment 28* to this young man, that his existence seemed interwoven with that of Jinkins. “No, Dick must go too.” Thus the cavalcade moved forward like a funeral procession. We from design had stowed my uncle and Mrs. Cary, in the same carriage, but I shall believe to the day of my death that they never exchanged a word during the ride. It was ludicrous enough to see the party ushered into the humble house of Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan. After so long a time, we made shift to get my uncle housed, and seated in an arm-chair, which had been brushed up and placed before the fire for the purpose. The old man completely filled the chair, muffled up as he was in cloaks and great-coats, he resembled an eastern Emperor, being fully as thick as he was long, while he supported himself with his gold-headed cane, in order to sit firm. After he was settled to our minds, the ladies were next accommodated with seats; but the size of the parlour was such that no room was left at the fire for the gentlemen without crowding the ladies—we therefore sat down at their backs, and a deficiency of seats happening to occur, Jinkins after standing some time, picked up an old three-legged chair (without a back) and placing it firm against the wall sat himself down, trusting to providence for consequences. But Sambo and Ling are still to be disposed of—Sambo pushed in and looking round to observe what prospect for him, his master pointed to the corner on his left “here stow thyself to larboard, thee swab.” Ling squeezed in between his master's feet, and enjoyed the warmth of the fire with more than common satisfaction, and sure enough we were all finally settled. Every thing in the house (and that was not much) was neat—the hearth was cleanly swept, and the mantlepiece tricked out in tip-top style. After the bustle our arrival occasioned was over, Sullivan charged his fire with a double portion of wood, which soon obliged the Commodore and the ladies to give ground, and afforded an opportunity for all to share the warmth of the fire. In the meantime Jinkins' seat gave way, and he not being sufficiently guarded against its fallacy, came with his starboard side to the floor: this raised a laugh at his expence. “Zounds, Dick,” said my uncle, “thee like to have run afoul o' the rocks; why didn't thee make thy anchor sure, boy?” Sambo by this time began to be very much annoyed by the heat, hemmed in on all sides as he was, I saw that it would be impossible for him to occupy his tenement much longer. He had been veering (as my uncle would call it) from right to left, and from left to right, with increasing activity for some time. At length being unable to endure it any longer, he forced a passage through the crowd, with an exclamation of “you reckon de debil could stan' dat?” and flew out of the house with the rapidity of lightning. Mrs. Sullivan after recieving and returning the salutation of the company, withdrew as I suspected to the kitchen for the purpose of preparing tea. She was in appearance older than her husband, not handsome, low of stature, dark skin, and black eyes, but her looks bespoke all that could be conceived of good nature and benevolence; and if I had the liberty of giving my opinion, I should say it would not be long before she —, and I began to reflect that our visit perhaps was ill-timed. My uncle Thomas viewed her at first sight with a degree of surprise, resembling that of Sancho Panzy when day light disclosed to him the pasteboard nose. Mrs. Cary now enquired for the children, who came pouring in from the kitchen, whence they had been driven upon our arrival—there were six in all, three sons and three daughters. When we love a man how natural it is to love all that belongs to him; even before I saw saw those children, I felt my heart warm at the sound of their names. There's one apiece for us, thought I, and took one of the rosy-cheeked rogues in my lap, and Jinkins pulled another to him, patted him on the cheek, and gave him some change to buy him a gun. My uncle took out his gold watch and snuff-box, alternately presenting them to the youngest (a beautiful boy of four years old) to entice him to sit on his knee. The child, however, stood off, surveying him with that sort of curiosity so common to children—at length, being unable to resist the temptation, he suffered himself to be lifted on the old gentleman's knee, who called Sambo, to “go and procure apples and ginger-bread, declaring that not one of the other children should have one.” This stipulation was no doubt an indispensable preliminary to the treaty of amity about to be ratified between them. Mrs. Cary had brought frocks for the little girls— Mary and Martha remembered the brides' favours: every thing was pretty, mighty pretty, mine is the prettiest, it is beautiful—nothing but noise, pulling, hawling, and joyful acclamations was to be heard. In the midst of the tumult in comes Sambo, “give me one, give me one,” was repeated by the whole group, but the little proprietor however, seized them with both hands, and looking up in my uncle's face, exclaimed— “They sha'nt have them, they are mine, an't they? sha'nt have one, shall they? an't I your boy? won't you hit them with your cane?” “Yes, that I will,” said the old man, “let 'um go and buy apples themselves if they want 'um.” To keep the peace, and restore harmony amongst them, I sent the oldest boys to buy apples and cakes for them all. In the meantime the champaign was handed round with great liberality, accompanied with the laugh and the jest. Mrs. Sullivan occasionally appeared and disappeared; though it was evident she partook in the merriment, I saw by the colour of her face that tea could not be far off, and I was glad for her sake, as she was not in a situation to undergo such fatigue. The children were dismissed by Sullivan to the kitchen, where they might regale themselves without molestation on their sweet-cakes and apples. Sometime after, they disappeared, one of them (the one I had caressed on their first appearance) came running in and addressing himself to me, in an audible voice, said “O my, if mammy hasn't got the most cups in the kitchen, and she is making tea, and a whole heap of things, and she's borrowed all Mrs. Cantler's teaspoons and plates and ever so many things; why there's so many of you here you'll eat all mamma's victuals up.” The company burst into a loud peal of laughter. “Get you gone,” said his father, “and don't be after talking saucy to the gentlemen.” Just at this moment the maid appeared with a teaboard loaded with cups and saucers, which she sat on a small table, she then withdrew and in a short time returned followed by the lady of the house, with whom we took tea in form. I felt no small degree of concern for Jinkins, as there was no alternative for him but to fix up the old chair once more. I was in pain lest he might tumble over again and scald himself, and worse, break the poor woman's cups. Tea being over and every expression of kindness and good will interchanged between the two families, we returned home safe and in fine spirits, laughing all the way at the incidents of the evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVI. After attending the ladies home, I proposed a walk to Jinkins. I was anxious to learn Horton's situation, whether he lacked any thing to render him comfortable. Calling at the Post Office on our way thither, I found a letter from New-York: I broke the seal hastily and looking at the signature found it was from Doctor Nevitt—wishing to read it at my leisure, we walked on to Horton's. It was dark when we arrived; he was sitting at supper with his family, and received us with every demonstration of joy. Mrs. Horton, in whose countenance never aught but sweetness (the influence of virtue) shone, received us like a blushing bride, while peace and contentment sat on every brow. The penitent Horton was overwhelmed at this instance of our generosity and attention, and invited us to partake of his supper. We thanked him, observing we had just rose from tea, and entered upon common topics of conversation, avoiding every thing which might tend to wound his feelings, or those of his family. Every thing about the house looked neat and comfortable, and the table was amply spread. I asked him “what business he intended to pursue, or whether any?” He said “if he had a capital he would set up a grocery.” I replied “he should not want the necessary sum, and that he had better perhaps go to New-York; he might take an apartment in one of my buildings, and Mrs. Horton could have her chamber and kitchen if she wished one, and he should have it gratis the first year, after that at a moderate rent. I would on my own account prefer him to another.” He thanked me and looked at his wife, as if to consult her, but she remained silent. I told him he had better perhaps make his arrangements for removing there as soon as possible; he might, however, consider upon it, and let me know in the course of the week—that I should go to New-York myself in a few weeks, and should be glad to know his determination, and after some minutes we took our leave, as I was anxious to hear from the Doctor. We had proceeded perhaps half way to our lodgings, when suddenly we heard a voice exclaim, “this is the villain! seize him, seize him!” The noise now increased to a tumultuous buz of numbers and we could distinguish nothing. It proceeded from one of the alleys which formed an angle with the street we were in. I proposed going to see what poor wretch it was, and what his crime: perhaps he might be innocent, perhaps not; he might be poor, he might want money, he might want a friend, he might want something. My own sufferings had been so great and so acute, that I felt for every child of misfortune. I felt the force more than ever of that emphatic reply of Terence:—“I am a man, I therefore have an interest in every thing that concerns humanity.” We advanced but a few steps when we were met by several men dragging a poor creature between them. Whatever had been his crime, his looks bespoke poverty and want; but we shall soon know thought I, what he has done.” “We will go,” said I “to Jinkins and see this poor fellow tried.” for they were taking him before an officer of the police. When we arrived there, the magistrate asked “where were the witnesses?” one of the men stepped out, and in a few minutes brought in a middle aged woman; she was sworn and gave the following testimony against the prisoner: “She had stepped out of her house to see a neighbour, and sat some time talking with her friend, and while she was there, one of her children ran to her crying, and told her that a strange man had come into the house, and was stealing the bread, and that she and the man at whose house she was, ran as fast as they could, and when they had got near the house this man, pointing to the prisoner, ran out of the door, and that the man who was with her persued him—that her children were crying when she came to them, and she went in to quiet them.” “And what did he take out of your house?” said the magistrate. “—She did not know whether he took any thing or not except some bread, which was in a cupboard—that the children told her he came in and went to the cupboard, and took the bread, but whether he had taken any thing else or not she could not tell, as she had not had time to examine.” The man gave in nearly the same testimony, except the bread, which she only had from the children. The magistrate desired the woman to withdraw, and told her she “would do well to see whether she had lost any thing, that he should hold the prisoner to bail, and she could make the requisite search in the meantime.” When she was gone he told the men to search the prisoner and see what was to be found upon him. This they did in his presence, and found nothing but a penknife. The poor hungry wretch had lost his bread, I suspect, (if he took any) in the squabble. “I suppose two hundred dollars will do,” said the magistrate, whose lenity and mildness towards this unfortunate man interested me much in his favour. “Can you give security to that amount?” He replied that “he did not know—he was a stranger in the place.” “Gentlemen,” said the magistrate, “must this man go to prison? will none of you venture to bail him?” no one spoke. “I must write your mittimus, then,” said he. “I will be one,” said Jinkins. “I will be another,” said I. The poor creature, for the first time, looked up, and such a meagre countenance I never saw. The magistrate wrote the bonds, and called upon us severally for our names. The prisoner eyed me with apparent attention, and seemed to change countenance upon hearing my name. Of this I took little notice, being in haste to have done. When the business was finished we arose to depart, and bowing to the company, I invited the prisoner, whose name was Smith, to accompany us, telling him, with a smile, “that I was compelled to look after him.” He bowed and accepted the invitation, and I thought I saw his eye fill as he spoke. It must be a hard-hearted wretch, indeed, that kindness cannot penetrate; but this depends upon circumstances entirely. Had this man been wealthy, or even independent, my attention to him would have passed over as a thing by the by—but poor and friendless as he was, it affected him to the quick. As we walked towards our lodgings I asked him “if he had any friends or acquaintances in the city?” He answered “that he had a few acquaintances, but he did not know that he had a friend in the world; but this he said was his own fault, for his conduct had been such that he deserved none.” I asked him what part of the Union he was reared in? “Dear sir,” said he, “excuse me, for I am an outcast from my country. I dare not be seen there.” I observed that I would not press the thing; I was merely talking to pass off the time, and that I had no desire to pry into his affairs; but hoped he would amend his life, from this time; that the sense he had of his faults was a favourable symptom. Just at this instont, I saw him take something from the extended hand of Jinkins, which I concluded was his purse. We were now at our lodgings, I hastened to the landlord, and desired supper to be set immediately for one person, a friend of mine, and leaving the stranger in a room where I requested his supper might be served, I stepped to the bar-keeper for a bottle of wine, which I set on a table by Smith, telling him to help himself and that he should have something to eat, in a few minutes. It is needless to repeat the expressions of gratitude and thanks this poor creature bestowed on me in his turn, for poor he was His clothes were all in tatters, and his shirt was as black as a chimney-sweeper. He 24 shivered with cold, and ate as if he had eat nothing in three days. No wonder he forced the bread from the woman! Oh misery, misery, how appalling thou art!— This unhappy man, I thought, no doubt, impelled by want has committed some crime for which he has been obliged to quit his native soil, and roam abandoned amongst unfeeling strangers. When I viewed his dress and his meagre looks it brought to mind my own situation, from which I had but just escaped—and feel for him I did at every pore of my heart. Had I not done so I had deserved a tenfold vengeance at the hand of Him who disposes events. I drew his table near the fire and cautioned him against eating too much; but seeing no abatement for several minutes after this precaution, I began to be alarmed, and told him I must insist upon his leaving off, and desired the waiter to carry away the things. I perceived no alteration in his looks at this order—he neither frowned nor smiled. I told him he might drink as much wine as he pleased, but I thought it dangerous to indulge him in eating any more, and enquired how long it had been since he eat?— Guess my astonishment when he replied he had not eaten a meal in four days! he had, in that time, begged a little girl for part of a piece of bread she was eating, and at another time he took a bone of meat, by force, from a dog. “Well, my friend, content yourself, you shall never want another meal, at least while I have any thing myself; in the meantime you will not take it amiss if I send you a change of clothes until you can have some made.” “Oh, sir, this is too much for such a wretch as I am. You know not sir for whom you are doing all this—I am a bad man, a very bad man.” “There are none of us good,” said I, and left him for the present. I stepped to the landlord and desired him to send a tub of water into the next room with a towel and plenty of soap, and then proceeded to the parlour of Mrs. Cary, where Jinkins had already related the cause of our absence. Every one enquired who the stranger was—I begged them to excuse me—I did not know, and left them abruptly. Going to my chamber I selected a complete suit of clothes, a change or two of linen, and proceeded with them to the room in which I left Smith. I laid them on a chair and told him the servant would bring him water to wash, after which he would oblige me by putting on the clothes—that I would stay with him longer, but having other engagements, I was compelled to leave him— that he would sleep there that night, and further it was my wish that he would remain there, and then bid him good night. “I'll be bound, for Charles he's been seein' to the poor fellow, here these milksops sit as if 'were nailed to the stools 'cause they're got a wife, would'nt give 'um for a squadron o'ye, how do'st 'do Charles did'st give the poor fellow something to put 'um comfortable?” “I have sir.” “Jinkins is tellin' as how they was going to harryfy and tarryfy 'um and put 'um in limbo and all that, tho'f I scolded Dick 'case he dident let me know, I would a thought nothin' a walkin' that far to save a comrade from a tucken up.—What dose say Charles, dose want any thing? Jinkins says give 'um some.—Dick knew that was right, faith if 'hadn't done it 'would a sent him a drift.” I told him the stranger was well taken care of, and had plenty to eat and drink. The company had waited supper for us some time, I sat down with them, and taking a cup of choclate, excused myself, and withwrew to my room to read the Doctor's letter. It ran in the following words:— “Dear Sir.—Agreeably to my promise, I communicate the following particulars relative to Miss Simpson. “She continues to mend every day; I think her cure will be perfected in the course of three or four weeks. The girl you left here, still attends her with unremitting attention. “I yesterday for the first time informed her that you were brother to the young lady that formerly lived at her father's, and that your name was Burlington. She was much agitated, and I said no more to her for some time. —When she asked, “what was become of Miss Mary?” I told her she was in Philadelphia, and was to be married in a few days, to a Mr. Wilson an old suitor, and that you had recovered your property, with every other circumstance that related to your present happy independence. “She was greatly astonished—sighing deeply, she said had you known how unworthy she was of your compassion, and the cruel treatment your sister received from her, you would have left her to that fate she so justly deserved. I thought I would let her rest upon her own ideas awhile, and enquired how she came to fall into the distressing situation in which you found her. “She answered, that she had been seduced by a wretch from her father's house, that her father was a respectable man in Boston, he had one son and three daughters; she was the eldest. She then went on to relate the story of your sister, the plots that were laid to ensuare her, and the falsehoods she propagated to injure her—she took the whole of the blame on herself. She said she reigned mistress in the family, and would have every thing as she pleased, not even her father or mother dared to contradict her. “On mentioning her parents, she burst into a flood of tears, and it was several minutes before she was able to proceed—I was a very undutiful child, I broke my father's heart—no wonder God has sent his judgments upon me. “I asked her what had become of the man who seduced her, what was his name, and place of residence, and whether it was to him she owed the complaint, under which she had so nearly fallen a sacrifice? “She said his name was Hunter—that he had been partly reared in New-York, but was often in Boston— that he had been guilty of crimes, was thrown into prison, and while there contrived to write to her, and entreated her to aid him in getting out: that through her means he was let out with a false key, which she hired a man to make at a great expence. She had agreed to run off with him to North-Carolina, and get married: (poor fool that I was)—but at that time I really loved him, was blind to his faults, and believed every thing that he said. I met him at a place agreed upon, with only one small trunk of clothes, and as many more as I could tie in a handkerchief. I had bespoke a passage to Norfolk, in Virginia—from there we were to go by land to Carolina. As the vessel was to sail by day-light in the morning, and as the keeper of the prison would not discover the cheat until the usual time of taking breakfast to the prisoners, the prospect of our getting off was favourable. I had stolen five hundred dollars from my father the night before we sailed—this with a little change and a gold watch which Hunter had, was all our dependence, and we left Boston under feigned names. “We had a quick passage to Norfolk; there we tarried a week, and I passed for his sister. At Norfolk he spent his time with gamblers at the gaming table, where he won all their money. From this place instead of going to North-Carolina, we took shipping for Charleston, South-Carolina, which was against my will. I urged him to go to North-Carolina, where we could have our marriage celebrated with more facility, but he was inflexible. “I now, for the first time, began to suspect his sincerity; but it was too late. I set off with him to Charleston, where we passed for man and wife, and took lodgings in an obscure part of the town. Flushed with his success at Norfolk, he became a gambler by profession, and spent his time wholly with gamblers, and the most abandoned characters; he would be out whole nights, rioting in all manner of debauchery—he would often bring his companions to my room, where they would drink and carouse till day-light: singing lewd songs, demolishing glasses, bottles, chairs, and tables; cursing, swearing, and very often fighting. It was in vain to remonstrate against these unparalleled scenes. “Not to tire you, sir, we lived in this manner nine months; during which time he had extorted my last dollar for stakes—sometimes he won, but oftener lost, and being detected by the police officers, he decamped I knew not where, leaving me without a single dollar, and in daily expectation of being confined. When I *24 found he was indeed gone, I congratulated myself, as he eternally disturbed my quiet. I sent for the landlord and candidly confessed the whole truth to him, begging him to dispose of some jewels upon the best terms he could, pay himself for the rent which was due, and purchase the requisites for my confinement: and told him if that was not sufficient, I had some good clothes left, which he would have the goodness to dispose of, in order to make himself sure. The landlord was a humane, goodhearted man, or I do not know what would have become of me. Matters being thus arranged, I waited the issue with an aching heart. “In the meantime I wrote home to my oldest sister, calling myself Mrs. Hunter. This was the first time I had written home since I left Boston. In this letter I concealed my misfortunes, but begged her to implore the forgiveness of my parents, and write to me as quick as possible—that if my parents refused to forgive me, I would never see them more. In short, sir, my child died, and I had every attention paid to me during my illness which I had a right to expect. “When I recovered my health, I took in sewing and all sorts of needle-work, and not having heard from my parents, I determined not to return to Boston until I was sure of being forgiven. I saw no company except my landlord and his wife, who treated me with great kindness and respect. I set up a milliner's shop, worked day und night, and made money fast. At length I received the long-looked-for letter from my sister. It brought news that my father was dead! that he never was well from the time I had cloped, that the family was in the deepest distress, that my father's creditors rushed upon the family without delay or mercy, and his property fell by a great deal short of paying his debts, that my brother had abandoned himself to drunkeness and debauchery, that she and her other sister had taken a small room and followed mantua-making for the purpose of maintaining themselves and their aged mother. That my mother when pressed upon the subject of my forgiveness, said she never would, though she would be glad if I would come and see my sisters. “This melancholy news almost drove me distracted. My father dead! I could never forgive myself, and was for a long time inconsolable! Not to be tedious, I continued in Charleston where I got plenty of work, intending to make a little sum for the relief of my mother, besides as much as would clothe me decently, and pay my passage to Boston; to this end, I doubled my diligence, I sat up late and early, got a handsome custom. I sat behind my counter all day, to attend my customers, and worked every moment I had to spare. It was about six months or nearly that from the time I received the letter from my sister, when upon counting my money I found it amounted to two hundred and sixty dollars; I owed about as much as my stock would sell for, so that I could count nothing upon that. “I had sat up late that night, the embers on the hearth were dead, my candle was burnt to the snuff, when I was roused from my reverie by a gentle tap at the door; I ran and hid my money under the head of my bed, and thinking none other than the landlady was at the door, stepped to it to see what was the matter, when who should it be but Hunter! His appearance was so sudden and unexpected, that it deprived me both of speech and motion. He took the advantage of my situation, and caught me in his arms—`My dear Clarissa,' said he, `forgive me, take pity on me, and give me something to eat, for I am starving.' His pathetic address, added to his miserable situation, softened me into pity; my resolution gave way, and his tears which flowed plentifully, obtained his pardon. I opened a drawer where I kept wine, buiscuit, cheese, &amp;c., lighted a candle and sat the whole affair upon the table, bidding him go and eat; he sat down and eat voraciously, thanking, and praying God to bless me all the while. After eating sometime, `dear Clarissa,' said he, `come and take a glass of wine with me'—I refused: `I will drink none then,' said he mournfully. I went to the table and filled two glasses and we drank, he pressed my hand to his lips; in short, he spent the night with me and several weeks, during which time we were married. This was done very privately, no one being present but the landlord, who alone knew that we had never been married before. All went on very well; I attended to my business as usual, still thinking I would go and see my mother, and return, as my husband dare not show his face there. We had agreed that he should remain in Charleston, I would visit my mother, obtain some relief from Hunter's father, if I could see him, and return. Hunter's father I knew was wealthy, and he was his only child, and although he had not heard from him since he had been imprisoned in Boston, yet I hoped the time was not far distant when I was to be independent and happy. “In the meantime I made arrangements for my journey, and packing up a few clothes in a small trunk, I deposited the money which I intended as a present for my mother, in the bottom of the trunk, taking out barely enough to bear my expences. Matters being thus arranged, I went to bed, fully intending to set out next morning by six o'clock, but in the night my treacherous husband decamped, taking my trunk with him and all my hopes. “My situation next morning you may easily imagine—it was beyond description. But I soon found that this part of his conduct was but a trifle, when compared with what a few days brought to light. I found myself infected with a disease which your goodness has relieved. I sold off my stock, which was little more than sufficient to pay my debts, applied to a physician, received advice and medicine: and as I had understood Hunter to say that his father had large possessions in this city, I set sail in the first vessel that sailed, intending upon my arrival here to find out Hunter's father and disclose the whole matter to him. “When I arrived here, after much enquiry I was informed that such a man as I enquired for did live in the city, but was scarcely ever at home; that he had been absent for the last three months, no one knew whither. It is about six weeks since I landed in New-York, where I intended to remain until Hunter's father returned. In the meantime from neglect or some cause unknown to me, my complaint instead of growing better grew worse, probably from the distress of mind and fatigue I underwent. When Mr. Burlington came so fortunately, or unfortunately rather (for it was my earnest wish to die) I had just sold the last thing I had to purchase a little wood and procure medical aid. And even this was not mine, but I will tell him all, I will confess to him how cruel I was to his angelic sister, I will go on my knees to him, I will tell him that I did defraud his sister out of much—Yes, I will tell him that I did keep a necklace of her's through all my wants and distress, and fully intended to redeem it if I ever got well, for the purpose of returning it to the right owner, for I have never prospered since I had it: and if I live, I intend to refund every thing belonging to Miss Mary. “She then begged of me, since I was so good, she said, to go and see the jeweller and charge him not to dispose of the necklace; that it was not her own, but belonged to another, and that she would redeem it when she got well. “I desired her to make herself easy, that you were in the shop when the little girl came in with it, and that you took it out of the girl's hand and knew it to be your sister's, and to that circumstance she owed her recovery: for the moment you discovered her, you came for me, that you paid me my fee, purchased the necessaries she saw, and hired the nurse, paying her wages in advance; and that you and your sister being now independently rich, she would find it no hard matter to obtain your forgiveness. “She was amazed at hearing this—clasping her hands together and raising her eyes to heaven, thank God, said she, how glad I am to hear it; I hope I shall live to see them both, see them happy, and acknowledge my crimes to the innocent Mary, I shall never be happy until I do that. “I told her that she had better compose herself for the present, that she had exerted herself rather too much; she might rely firmly upon my attention until she was perfectly well, and that you would then furnish her with money to go where she wished. “Thus, sir, I have detailed to you the story of this unfortunate woman I shall be happy to hear from you at all times, and take pleasure in your correspondence. Respectfully yours.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dear Sir.—Agreeably to my promise, I communicate the following particulars relative to Miss Simpson. “She continues to mend every day; I think her cure will be perfected in the course of three or four weeks. The girl you left here, still attends her with unremitting attention. “I yesterday for the first time informed her that you were brother to the young lady that formerly lived at her father's, and that your name was Burlington. She was much agitated, and I said no more to her for some time. —When she asked, “what was become of Miss Mary?” I told her she was in Philadelphia, and was to be married in a few days, to a Mr. Wilson an old suitor, and that you had recovered your property, with every other circumstance that related to your present happy independence. “She was greatly astonished—sighing deeply, she said had you known how unworthy she was of your compassion, and the cruel treatment your sister received from her, you would have left her to that fate she so justly deserved. I thought I would let her rest upon her own ideas awhile, and enquired how she came to fall into the distressing situation in which you found her. “She answered, that she had been seduced by a wretch from her father's house, that her father was a respectable man in Boston, he had one son and three daughters; she was the eldest. She then went on to relate the story of your sister, the plots that were laid to ensuare her, and the falsehoods she propagated to injure her—she took the whole of the blame on herself. She said she reigned mistress in the family, and would have every thing as she pleased, not even her father or mother dared to contradict her. “On mentioning her parents, she burst into a flood of tears, and it was several minutes before she was able to proceed—I was a very undutiful child, I broke my father's heart—no wonder God has sent his judgments upon me. “I asked her what had become of the man who seduced her, what was his name, and place of residence, and whether it was to him she owed the complaint, under which she had so nearly fallen a sacrifice? “She said his name was Hunter—that he had been partly reared in New-York, but was often in Boston— that he had been guilty of crimes, was thrown into prison, and while there contrived to write to her, and entreated her to aid him in getting out: that through her means he was let out with a false key, which she hired a man to make at a great expence. She had agreed to run off with him to North-Carolina, and get married: (poor fool that I was)—but at that time I really loved him, was blind to his faults, and believed every thing that he said. I met him at a place agreed upon, with only one small trunk of clothes, and as many more as I could tie in a handkerchief. I had bespoke a passage to Norfolk, in Virginia—from there we were to go by land to Carolina. As the vessel was to sail by day-light in the morning, and as the keeper of the prison would not discover the cheat until the usual time of taking breakfast to the prisoners, the prospect of our getting off was favourable. I had stolen five hundred dollars from my father the night before we sailed—this with a little change and a gold watch which Hunter had, was all our dependence, and we left Boston under feigned names. “We had a quick passage to Norfolk; there we tarried a week, and I passed for his sister. At Norfolk he spent his time with gamblers at the gaming table, where he won all their money. From this place instead of going to North-Carolina, we took shipping for Charleston, South-Carolina, which was against my will. I urged him to go to North-Carolina, where we could have our marriage celebrated with more facility, but he was inflexible. “I now, for the first time, began to suspect his sincerity; but it was too late. I set off with him to Charleston, where we passed for man and wife, and took lodgings in an obscure part of the town. Flushed with his success at Norfolk, he became a gambler by profession, and spent his time wholly with gamblers, and the most abandoned characters; he would be out whole nights, rioting in all manner of debauchery—he would often bring his companions to my room, where they would drink and carouse till day-light: singing lewd songs, demolishing glasses, bottles, chairs, and tables; cursing, swearing, and very often fighting. It was in vain to remonstrate against these unparalleled scenes. “Not to tire you, sir, we lived in this manner nine months; during which time he had extorted my last dollar for stakes—sometimes he won, but oftener lost, and being detected by the police officers, he decamped I knew not where, leaving me without a single dollar, and in daily expectation of being confined. When I *24 found he was indeed gone, I congratulated myself, as he eternally disturbed my quiet. I sent for the landlord and candidly confessed the whole truth to him, begging him to dispose of some jewels upon the best terms he could, pay himself for the rent which was due, and purchase the requisites for my confinement: and told him if that was not sufficient, I had some good clothes left, which he would have the goodness to dispose of, in order to make himself sure. The landlord was a humane, goodhearted man, or I do not know what would have become of me. Matters being thus arranged, I waited the issue with an aching heart. “In the meantime I wrote home to my oldest sister, calling myself Mrs. Hunter. This was the first time I had written home since I left Boston. In this letter I concealed my misfortunes, but begged her to implore the forgiveness of my parents, and write to me as quick as possible—that if my parents refused to forgive me, I would never see them more. In short, sir, my child died, and I had every attention paid to me during my illness which I had a right to expect. “When I recovered my health, I took in sewing and all sorts of needle-work, and not having heard from my parents, I determined not to return to Boston until I was sure of being forgiven. I saw no company except my landlord and his wife, who treated me with great kindness and respect. I set up a milliner's shop, worked day und night, and made money fast. At length I received the long-looked-for letter from my sister. It brought news that my father was dead! that he never was well from the time I had cloped, that the family was in the deepest distress, that my father's creditors rushed upon the family without delay or mercy, and his property fell by a great deal short of paying his debts, that my brother had abandoned himself to drunkeness and debauchery, that she and her other sister had taken a small room and followed mantua-making for the purpose of maintaining themselves and their aged mother. That my mother when pressed upon the subject of my forgiveness, said she never would, though she would be glad if I would come and see my sisters. “This melancholy news almost drove me distracted. My father dead! I could never forgive myself, and was for a long time inconsolable! Not to be tedious, I continued in Charleston where I got plenty of work, intending to make a little sum for the relief of my mother, besides as much as would clothe me decently, and pay my passage to Boston; to this end, I doubled my diligence, I sat up late and early, got a handsome custom. I sat behind my counter all day, to attend my customers, and worked every moment I had to spare. It was about six months or nearly that from the time I received the letter from my sister, when upon counting my money I found it amounted to two hundred and sixty dollars; I owed about as much as my stock would sell for, so that I could count nothing upon that. “I had sat up late that night, the embers on the hearth were dead, my candle was burnt to the snuff, when I was roused from my reverie by a gentle tap at the door; I ran and hid my money under the head of my bed, and thinking none other than the landlady was at the door, stepped to it to see what was the matter, when who should it be but Hunter! His appearance was so sudden and unexpected, that it deprived me both of speech and motion. He took the advantage of my situation, and caught me in his arms—`My dear Clarissa,' said he, `forgive me, take pity on me, and give me something to eat, for I am starving.' His pathetic address, added to his miserable situation, softened me into pity; my resolution gave way, and his tears which flowed plentifully, obtained his pardon. I opened a drawer where I kept wine, buiscuit, cheese, &amp;c., lighted a candle and sat the whole affair upon the table, bidding him go and eat; he sat down and eat voraciously, thanking, and praying God to bless me all the while. After eating sometime, `dear Clarissa,' said he, `come and take a glass of wine with me'—I refused: `I will drink none then,' said he mournfully. I went to the table and filled two glasses and we drank, he pressed my hand to his lips; in short, he spent the night with me and several weeks, during which time we were married. This was done very privately, no one being present but the landlord, who alone knew that we had never been married before. All went on very well; I attended to my business as usual, still thinking I would go and see my mother, and return, as my husband dare not show his face there. We had agreed that he should remain in Charleston, I would visit my mother, obtain some relief from Hunter's father, if I could see him, and return. Hunter's father I knew was wealthy, and he was his only child, and although he had not heard from him since he had been imprisoned in Boston, yet I hoped the time was not far distant when I was to be independent and happy. “In the meantime I made arrangements for my journey, and packing up a few clothes in a small trunk, I deposited the money which I intended as a present for my mother, in the bottom of the trunk, taking out barely enough to bear my expences. Matters being thus arranged, I went to bed, fully intending to set out next morning by six o'clock, but in the night my treacherous husband decamped, taking my trunk with him and all my hopes. “My situation next morning you may easily imagine—it was beyond description. But I soon found that this part of his conduct was but a trifle, when compared with what a few days brought to light. I found myself infected with a disease which your goodness has relieved. I sold off my stock, which was little more than sufficient to pay my debts, applied to a physician, received advice and medicine: and as I had understood Hunter to say that his father had large possessions in this city, I set sail in the first vessel that sailed, intending upon my arrival here to find out Hunter's father and disclose the whole matter to him. “When I arrived here, after much enquiry I was informed that such a man as I enquired for did live in the city, but was scarcely ever at home; that he had been absent for the last three months, no one knew whither. It is about six weeks since I landed in New-York, where I intended to remain until Hunter's father returned. In the meantime from neglect or some cause unknown to me, my complaint instead of growing better grew worse, probably from the distress of mind and fatigue I underwent. When Mr. Burlington came so fortunately, or unfortunately rather (for it was my earnest wish to die) I had just sold the last thing I had to purchase a little wood and procure medical aid. And even this was not mine, but I will tell him all, I will confess to him how cruel I was to his angelic sister, I will go on my knees to him, I will tell him that I did defraud his sister out of much—Yes, I will tell him that I did keep a necklace of her's through all my wants and distress, and fully intended to redeem it if I ever got well, for the purpose of returning it to the right owner, for I have never prospered since I had it: and if I live, I intend to refund every thing belonging to Miss Mary. “She then begged of me, since I was so good, she said, to go and see the jeweller and charge him not to dispose of the necklace; that it was not her own, but belonged to another, and that she would redeem it when she got well. “I desired her to make herself easy, that you were in the shop when the little girl came in with it, and that you took it out of the girl's hand and knew it to be your sister's, and to that circumstance she owed her recovery: for the moment you discovered her, you came for me, that you paid me my fee, purchased the necessaries she saw, and hired the nurse, paying her wages in advance; and that you and your sister being now independently rich, she would find it no hard matter to obtain your forgiveness. “She was amazed at hearing this—clasping her hands together and raising her eyes to heaven, thank God, said she, how glad I am to hear it; I hope I shall live to see them both, see them happy, and acknowledge my crimes to the innocent Mary, I shall never be happy until I do that. “I told her that she had better compose herself for the present, that she had exerted herself rather too much; she might rely firmly upon my attention until she was perfectly well, and that you would then furnish her with money to go where she wished. “Thus, sir, I have detailed to you the story of this unfortunate woman I shall be happy to hear from you at all times, and take pleasure in your correspondence. Respectfully yours.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVII. The story of this unfortunate young woman affected me too much too sleep, I therefore called for pen, ink and paper and answered the Doctor's letter, informing him “that I should be in New-York in the course of a week or ten days, and desired him to tell Clarissa that Hunter's father was then in New-York, but she need give herself no trouble on his account: that I would be there shortly, and do her business with him.” Yes, poor Clarissa, I will be your friend, true you have erred greatly, said I internally, and who has not? thy tears and prayers shall not be in vain: you have sinned, and so have I: you have suffered much, so have I: God forbid that I should add to your sufferings by upbraiding you, but if I can find your seducer—rash thought. Yes, if I could find him all hardened as he is, the thoughts of his wrongs to thee should not be forgiven; I forgive from my heart his conduct to my sister. But—no matter, the vengeance of heaven will, if it has not already, overtake him; poor wretch, perhaps he is even now in want of bread. Jinkins who slept with me, now entered my room. “I am glad you are come,” said I, “I was just taking the blues.” “What's the matter now?” said he—“any bad news from New-York? you have read the letter, I presume?” I reminded him of the young woman whom I found ill there, and read to him the letter. “Curse them Hunters!” said he, “they must be limbs of the D—l himself.” I told him I should go to New-York in a week or two, and would be glad of his company; that I wished to settle my business upon a more permanent plan, as Wilson would go to Tennessee in the spring, and I should accompany him.” He said “he did not care much, provided old square toes was willing.” I undertook to obtain his consent, without which I would not wish him to go: and asked him “If he had seen Smith?” He said “he saw a man that he took to be him, but he was so altered since he was dressed, that he never should have known him; indeed, he had to ask if he was the same man?” “And what shall we do with him now, Jinkins?” said I thoughtfully, and hardly knowing what I said. “I don't know what you will do with him, now you have dressed him up like a gentleman, without you can get him into the army or navy, and he looks like a coward too—I dare say he is not powder-proof. It would have been better if you had set him to cleaving wood, he looks so like a scape-gallows, that he is fit for nothing else.” “Oh don't talk so, Dick, the poor fellow is in distress—he is poor.” “He talks cheerful,” said Jinkins: “he seems to be quite renovated since he had his supper.” “I'll see in the morning what he can do, but no one will employ him without a recommendation, and that I suspect he cannot obtain. I suspect your plan will be the best, that is to get him a birth on board of a ship, it will be the best place for him.” Next morning after breakfast I walked into Smith's room, and asked him how he felt? He replied “very well.” I was truly surprized to see the alteration which dress made in his appearance. I entered into conversation with him, and soon discovered he was not of the lower order. I asked him, “What he intended to do when his trial was over? I shall fee a lawyer for you, and expect you will be acquitted.” Before he had time to reply, some one knocked at the door, and Horton entered the room. He bowed slightly to me, and viewing Smith with uncommon attention for a few seconds, exclaimed, “Why, William is this you?” Smith answered “yes,” advanced and shook hands with Horton, but evidently very much embarrassed. “And where have you been all this time?” said Horton; “your father is much distressed on your account.” “And where is my father?” said Smith. “That I don't know,” replied the other, “but I suppose this gentleman has told you where he was not long ago.” “He has not,” said he—“the gentleman does not know who I am.” “Then I will make you acquainted. This is Mr. Hunter.” I had indeed suspected it was Hunter's son, (but could hardly bring myself to think so when I discovered that he and Horton were known to each other; and what's to be done now? thought I—what will those he has injured say, if they find him out? Here was Burlington, alias Dupon, here is my sister, will they forgive crimes such as his? and here too is Mrs. Cary, it will not do, he must remain unknown. I informed Horton then of the circumstances which occurred in the street, as we were returning home from his house, and that he went by the name of Smith, and that it would be best for him still to go by that name, and charged him strictly not to discover his real name. This I said in the presence of Hunter; I then left them together, requesting Horton to tell him all he knew of his father. Getting up to leave the room, I told Hunter I wished to have some conversation with him in the course of the day, that he must abide where he was until something was done for him, that he might depend upon my secrecy as to his real name and character, of which I knew more than he was aware: I then left Horton to explain, and withdrew to the company. Jinkins asked me “what I was going to do with my man?” I told him “I believed I would take his advice, and send him to increase the Navy.” “That's right, my boy,” said my uncle, “I'll cut his eye-teeth there.” In the course of half an hour Horton came to the door, saying he desired to a speak a word to me. It was merely to tell me that he would close with my proposal to go to New-York. I informed him I should be there myself shortly, and he might move as soon as he liked; I would give him instructions what to do, should he get ready before I set out. After sitting some time, I excused myself to the company, and took Hanter to my room; ordering more fuel on the fire, I desired Hunter to be seated. “It is not to upbraid you, sir, either for your own crimes, or those which your father has committed towards me and my family; I leave that matter between you and your God. But we I find, are not the only persons you have injured; you have something left yet, enough with economy, to support you, which I suspect Horton has told you—but in the first place, sir, I wish to know what reparation you intend to make to another person, whom you shall soon hear of?” I then took the Doctor's letter out of my pocket, and read it to him. When I had done, I looked at him for a reply. He hung his head, and said “it was all true.” “And what sort of a wretch must you be, to treat a woman thus—who took you out of prison, left her father's house in the dead hour of the night, and no doubt this was the cause of his death? What a sea of iniquity have you waded through! But I spare your feelings; if you have any, they must be bitter enough—say, what will you do with your wife?” “I will reform,” said he, “and try to make her happy, if she will consent to live with me.” “But that I don't know,” said I, “she will have a bad bargain, make the best of you; but she is poor, and now dependent on me—her family you see is likewise poor, so that you have it in your power to do much. —If your wife refuses to live with you, which I think probable you can nevertheless render her some reparation by contributing to the relief of herself and her family.” 25 He replied “that he was entirely ignorant of his resources—that his father had for some years back almost abandoned him to want, on account of the dissolute life he pursued—that from what Horton had informed him respecting the turn of his father's affairs, his prospect was but small.” I gave him to understand the amount of what he might expect. He rejoined, “that the balance of his life should be spent in repairing the errors of the past, and whatever he might receive from the wreck of his father's fortune, should be liberally shared with his wife and her relations. `This,' added he, “is all I can say on that subject; but allow me sir to express my gratitude to you for your kindness, not only toward me last night, but in extending it to the forgiveness of crimes in their nature of the blackest die, but rendered still more so by your noble generosity.” I told him “the best recompense he could make was to amend his life.” I apprized him of my intended visit to New-York, where I should see his wife, and deliver any message or letter, he might wish to send, and probably I might see his father there also, “and as you can not, I presume, return to New-York or Boston, you can give me instructions in regard to what you wish done—I shall attend to it punctually. In the mean time you can remain in this city until your trial, and until I return, and pass by the name of Smith, as your real name may subject you to danger.—Here, even here, in this house, is the young man who rescued my sister, and on whose account you were imprisoned. “My sister is here also, married to a man, who might not so easily forget an injury; and here also is Mrs. Cary whose daughter is lately married to the same Dupon, whose real name is Burlington, a cousin of mine. “I could not undertake to defend you from the vengeance of all these, for which reason I think you had better seek a lodging in some other part of the town. I will furnish you with the amount of what you may want until I return. “All this you may do or not, just as it suits you, I merely give you my advice.” He accepted the offer, he said, and thanked me ten thousand times for my kindness. I left him for the present, and saught Jinkins to walk with Hunter to some remote part of the town, where I saw him comfortably lodged, paying his board in advance myself, lest he might be tempted by it to the gaming table. Learniug from Jinkins the amount, he gave him the proceeding night (forty dollars,) I conceived it quite enough to defray his ordinary expences. Finally, I directed him to get his letters and instructions ready, as I could not tell to a certainty when I should set out. I recommended to him to keep no company, but rather amuse himself with books—and that my favour and protection could only be secured by good behaviour on his part. As he shook hands with Jinkins and I, the tears for the first time trickled down his cheeks. Were I (as Goldsmith said upon another occasion) to be angry at mankind for their vices, I might have ample cause in the present instance to indulge that pasion; but would this be acting like a christian? Besides, who am I that I should impugn this unfortunate fellow creature? No! I chose rather to draw a veil over his crimes, and leave him to his conscience. It will be objected that this is nothing but a specious pretence to superior judgment, and that the subject was a favourable one to contrast vice—and all sorts of crimes, with their opposite virtues, and that such characters should be held up to public view as examples. Be it so—there are numbers no doubt, who would take great pleasure in expatiating upon the conduct of this unhappy young man; to them, therefore, I leave the task, reminding them at the same time, that if they wish their nostrum to go down, they must sweeten it well; and let them remember by the way, “To err is human, to pardon is divine.” As we returned home, we picked up an old German in the street, who was carrying a wallet on his shoulder, which contained some excellent pipins. As he was a great oddity, we brought him home with us for the amusement of my uncle and the ladies. He was about sixty or seventy years of age, a little stoop shouldered, sandy hair, swarthy complexion, and Jinkins said he was bandy-legged; as for that I can't say, as his trowsers, or unmentionables (which you please) were remarkably wide. His hat was a little less in circumference than a moderate umbrella, his coat or roundabout, came down to the waistbands, which were as low as I ever recollect to have seen. They were both of the same piece, stout and warm, his shoes were also strong and serviceable, having some two or three dozen, flat-headed nails droven into the heel. He walked with a staff fully eighteen inches higher than his head. We gave him his price for his apples, told him to bring them along to our lodgings, and we would pay him well for his trouble, and give him a glass of good wine besides. Upon entering the parlour, he walked carefully round the carpet, and made his obeisance to the company, by a “how to to laties and shentlemans.” I pointed to Mrs. Cary, telling him the apples were for her, giving her the wink at the same time. He layed his hat and his cane on the floor by him, but before he went farther, I gave him a glass of wine, saying “he must tell the lady all about his good apples, and the best way to rear them, as they were the best I ever saw. “Laty I ish been cot ta peshest aupples auver you tit see laty, ta ish shest ash sweet ash ta can pe une (and) I ish peen cot more areaty, une I ish peen cot dam (them) all ta year laty, une ta beach, une ta bear, une ta blum un ta charries laty.” “You must have a fine orchard sir, have you got the winter pear.” “Yough (yes) laty I ish peen cot ta vinder-bear ash pig ash so laty (putting his fists together) put ta ish all con areaty.” During this preamble, he never once thought of taking out the apples but sat with the wallet across his knees. Uncle Thomas viewing him with a mixture of surprise, dislike and impatience, not common to him, and perhaps his sympathy was excited in behalf of the ladies whose patience he thought might well be exhausted, accosted him with “Harkee comrade with the wallet, haul in thy outlandish lingo needn't make suck a fashs, cant unship cargo, and say no more about 'um.” It was pretty evident that neither understood the other. “I fear ta shantlemons not fersta,” (understand) said Coonrod looking round at my uncle who sat a little to the one side. “Thee may stay as long as thee likes friend, but thee needn't raise such a hurricane about thae apples if so be thee has got 'um, can't discharge freight and be done we' it.” I explained that he must take out the apples, he immediately emptied them out, and the ladies flocked round him in a trice, praised his apples and asked him abundance of questions about them, such as where he came across them? how long he had them? and the best method of preserving fruit-trees? Coonrod however was not to be discouraged by such a number of queries, asked in a breath. “I ish peen cot tish von, tish Swansyh (twenty) year laty, I cot dam from Fretherick Shitherstriker[12] [12] Sidirstricker, a German family in West, Va. une he pring dam from Sharmany.” “I must have some of the trees I declare,” said Mrs. Cary. “Fel laty you ken kit 'um, une Felty Holshhopple he ish peen cot dam too he'll kim you ta sem oder he leess farder in ta gundry.” Wilson interrupted him in this part of the conversation, by asking him “if he understood surgery?” The German however was not so easily to be taken by surprise. “You mean vot ish von procken pone, une but him to geder akin oder make him crow upe areaty.” “Yes sir that is what I mean to mend broken bones.” “No I ish peen cot mine angle vat out order blace more ash dwo dimes areaty, une it pen me, it pen me tish vat vorst ting, can pee areaty.” “An thee was put on a gib, for a monkey would pass well enough an thee larboard hat, spliced for a sail,' 25* said me uncle. “Charles give him another glass of wine, an thee can understand him, it's more than I can. What nation do h' belong? if bean't got amongst a very heathens, I believe sure there was none o' thae sart o' people where I was born.” I replied “he was a German, that they made the best of citizens—they were sober, peaceable, and industrious.” Old Coonrod now bethought himself of home, picked up his jacob-staff and hat, and bid us farewell. The balance of the evening was spent at the expence of the old German and his nation. For my own part, I took no part in the conversation respecting the Belgic race, but amused myself in explaining to my uncle, Coonrod's hard names. “Siderstricker,” said he, “Old Davy himself never heard such a name.—Well Dick that beats thee an thy old stool at the Irishman's.” An opportunity offering, I drew Mary to her chamber, and put into her hand the letter I received from Doctor Nevitt, telling her “the unhappy subject of it was no other than her old acquaintance, Clarissa Simpson,” and how I received her nacklace. The tender hearted Mary was deeply effected at the poor girl's situation, and enquired if there was no account of the wrotch Hunter? I informed her that I had heard of him, and would if in my power, make him do her justice.—I was going to New-York, where I probably should see all parties. In the mean time, I desired her to sound Mrs. Cary on the subject of marriage with my uncle. I told her I was serious, he was an excellent match for her, and that his situation required a help mate of her amiable disposition Indeed if any two were ever calculated for each other, they were. Their natures if any thing were too generous. I told Mary she must try and bring about a courtship through the agency of Fredinand and Martha, while Jinkins and myself were absent—that I promised myself much amusement on the part of the old man at least—as Mrs. Cary was so diffident, and her claims on us were too great to be made the subject of mirth; but I should like to hear my uncle adapt his sea phrases to the subject of wooing.” Mary replied, “that she and Martha had joked her mother about the old gentleman, but she feared it would be difficult to bring her uncle to bear, as he says, but we'll try him, I confess it would give me great pleasure to see them man and wife.” Having at length a small respite from business, I resolved to share the society of my friends, for as yet it had not been in my power to partake with them in that pleasure without which life has no charms. As I might not be long blessed with the opportunity, I determined to consecrate a few days at least, to that happiness to which I had long been a stranger. Our time was filled up with various amusements; some times we went to the play, sometimes we read an amusing play or novel, sometimes we told stories, played blind man's buff, the lady's carpet, and a number of other plays many of which were new to me, though Mary and Martha were perfect adepts in them. Sambo too amused us with many comic jestures and plays, common amongst the blacks of his original country. The old commander in chief would often join in our amusements, he always had to redeem his pawns by giving Mrs. Cary a kiss. Jinkins had to kiss Miss Watson, and very often I was obliged to kiss Sambo wheelbarrow fashion. Ling would sometimes join us, though I can't say he was altogether well pleased, particularly with blindman's buff, the propriety of which he seemed to question, as with pitiful looks, and tail tucked between his legs, he would scamper out of the way, thinking us crazy no doubt. Horton's wife and daughters, and our friend Mr. Sullivan were very often partakers in our amusements, and no one was better calculated to promote mirth, or beguile time than Sullivan; he was a perfect original, the child of nature, artless and modest, yet all mirth and humour. It was one of those pleasant evenings in which I strove to forget my past sufferings, that Mrs. Cary gratified the company, and myself in particular with the incidents of her life. She had promised us this pleasure some time, but my engagements had been such that it was delayed until I should be perfectly at leisure. She therefore one evening apprized us to be prepared against the following. It was likewise agreed that Jinkins should indulge us with a similar favour the succeeding night. I confess I had more than common curiosity on this occasion, both being amongst the numbers of those for whom I had the greatest regard. On the evening appointed, Mrs. Cary commenced the story of her life, which the reader will find in the following chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVIII. “I was born and educated in England, and was an only child.—My father was a poor curate in the parish of —, in the county of Herfordshire. He was a man of piety and learning, but having few friends, and those proving treacherous and deceitful, he never was advanced. He however kept a school, in which he taught the common branches of learning, usually taught in country schools; the profits of which, with the stipend of his curacy, furnished him barely with the necessaries of life. As his family was small, he might have laied up some thing at the years end; but he was continually preyed upon by the poor of his parish, and the generosity of his nature (which he possessed even to weakness) led him, contrary to the advice of his friends, to be not only the supporter, but the dupe of many of his parishioners. “My mother died when I was only three years of age—I remember nothing of her. My father upon her death, resolved never to marry, and kept his word. He kept a house-keeper and gardiner, which with myself constituted his family, though he was seldom without company, which his hospitality never failed to entertain. This was the case from the time I can remember, and Margaret, the house keeper, has often told me that it had always been the case, though she said, “if it had a been her, she would a sent 'um away with a flea in their ear to be eatin his honour out of house and home.” “When I became old enough to learn, my father sent me to a school mistress, who taught little children their letters, and a b ab's, I remember very well the first morning I was taken there by Margaret. I had a little book with a red cover, I did nothing however but admire my book, play with the children, and cry for my papa. In a few days however, I began to learn and became reconciled to the school. “I remained there about eighteen months, when my father removed me to his own school, where he taught me all that he thought necessary on the score of literature. “I was now thirteen years of age, and my father designing to give me an opportunity of acquiring higher accomplishments, sent me to a female boarding school in the town of —. “At this school I remained three years. I learned needle-work, drawing, painting and music. “At the end of three years, my father came to bring me home, not being able to keep me there any longer. This was a sore trial to me, as I had contracted friendships with my young school mates. Though glad to see my father, I wept bitterly upon taking leave of my friends. “My father strove to amuse me, by pointing out the beautiful country seats through which we passed; this, and the prospect of seeing aunt Margaret and old Daniel, the gardener, served in a great measure to restore my spirits. Old Daniel, with his hat under his arm, met us at the gate; he was quite transported to see me. `Why I had grown a big woman, and quite handsome; I declare, why you'll be a match for some of our grandees, who knows but you'll be a great lady yet, and take old Dan to wait on you?' “Margaret by this time had me in her arms, and such wonders—I was grown to be sure, how high? let me see? wants but half a head to be as tall as I. They nearly tore me to pieces between them. “I told Margaret I wanted something to eat. “And I have as fat a turkey as ever you tasted, said she, at the fire: it's been done these two hours. And I have good ale of my own brewing, and master said it wouldn't keep: but I knowed as how it would keep, by putting a whir o' hops, and I've got pickles, and I've got jam, and jellies, and sweet meats. “Dear Margaret, said I, get any thing at all—I have eat nothing since yesterday morning, which was true. “We were scarcely seated at table, when the parishioners hearing of my arrival, came pouring in upon me without ceremony. I was really provoked with them and their vulgar manners, though I should have been very glad to see them, had they not come in such crowds. They, or at least a great many of them, staid till late: eat and drank, and sending for a fiddle, tired as I was, I was obliged to dance. The whole neighbourhood next morning resounded with the praises of Miss Cary, for Cary was the name of my father. “In the meantime I was visited by many of the gentry of the country; some of them I presume came merely out of curiosity—many of them would, however, take me home with them in their carriages. I was often called on to sing, dance and play, but I gave myself no airs on that account, for I knew whom I was—a poor man's daughter. While I remained at the female school, I had forgotten much of the more essential parts of education; my father, as I was fond of reading, put history, travels, and natural and moral philosophy into my hands; I also reviewed geography, English grammar, &amp;c. My father would suffer me sometimes to read a play, but would never allow me to look into a novel; but, dear old man, how often I cheated him—I read every novel I met with at the houses of those I visited. The old gentleman, however, seldom consented to the importunities of those who often called for the purpose of taking me home with them, and without his consent I never visited. “About a year after I returned from school, I was sitting with my father one night—the candle had just been lighted, and each of us with a book were preparing to read. It was a very dark night, neither moon nor stars were to be seen. Margaret was in the parlour, where we were sitting—after lighting the candle, she must sweep the hearth for the second time. “While she was figiting about, and my father sitting with a book in his hand, looking over his spectacles at her, to see when she would be done, we heard the trampling of horses, and in the same instant somebody halloed at the gate. “Go,” said my father, “and see what they want. I suspect it is somebody who have lost their way; I heard hounds late this evening, and I'll be bound its some of the sportsmen.” “Margaret went to see what they wanted? “They had missed their way, and wanted somebody to put them into the road to Woodgrove.” “She didn't know the road.” “They bid her open the gate—and my father hearing them ride up to the door, went to meet them. “They begged the favour of him “to send some one to put them in the road—it's so d—n dark,” said one of them, “that we can't see our way.” “I believe we'll alight and warm awhile; its quite chilly this evening,” said one of them. “My father did not invite him with that cordiality he was wont to express generally, being disgusted with his abrupt manners. “He told them, however, “they were welcome to warm, and he would likewise send his servant to put them in the road.” “I arose and saluted them when they entered the room, and making room for them to approach the fire, I betook myself to reading with perfect unconcern. “The one who spoke at the door, looked at me some time, and asked my father “if I was his daughter?” “He replied that “I was.” “D—n fine girl, faith! Old gentleman, how did it happen that you have such a handsome daughter? she is an angel, by G—d.” “I turned my eyes upon him with a look of contempt. By his dress he appeared to be a nobleman, and on that account he presumed, no doubt, to take the liberty he did. “The other gentleman was an officer, from his uniform, of an humble grade, and much more agreeable manners, his countenance was prepossessing and modest, he blushed at the insolent language of his companion, and seeing their presence was by no means acceptable, he addressed his companion with “Come my lord, let us ride.” “D—n it Warberton don't be in such haste, it's as dark as it will be.—Old gentleman I should like to hear a little about your cirumstances and this young woman. I can't believe she's your daughter. “I am surprised, sir,” said my father, “to hear a gentleman of your appearance express yourself as you do,” adding with great warmth, “that though he was poor he ought not to be insulted in his own house.” “Hoity toity—you know but little of politeness or even common sense, sir, (said my father with spirit) not to know that what you call praise, is a gross insult. The servant is ready, sir, to show you into the great road,” as Daniel appeared, with a lanthorn in his hand. “Well,” said his lordship, “I suppose we must go— I'm sorry I affronted you, sir, but you'll make friends, won't you?” offering his hand to my father, who took the offered hand, saying “He was no man's foe.” “That's clever, my old dad—I've come down to tarry awhile amongst you. My estate lies not far from here, and you must come and see me, old buck—I should like to be better acquainted,” and giving me a significant look, he bid me good night and started, his companion following his example. “I do not know that I ever was more hurt in my life, except when I lost my husband. True, I have had more serious cause of affliction, but I was better prepared to meet it. “The whole matter was explained the following day; the clerk of the parish called in, as he frequently did, to tell us the news. Well, what was it?—why lord D. has come down to spend a few weeks at his estate, the old lord, his father, is dead. “They say he came down in a wonderful fine carriage, and a heap of servants, and there's the greatest doings at Woodgrove ever was heard on. Dorothy, the old house-keeper, slipped down to our house last night to tell us all about it. But she says he's no more like his father than she is like the queen. “She says her old lord always shook hands with her and enquired how she had been and how old Busky was, an old favourite dog, but as for her young lord, when she met him at the door, and drapped a low curtesy, and said “you're welcome my lord,” he just flew by her as though she'd been a witch, with a “how fares ye, how fares ye, old woman. “I be afeared he'll be a tightsome lord—Lord, I hear 26 as how he sent for the Steward as soon as he come, and desired him to be ready with his books and papers by the next morning. “They say he's one of your ranting, haughty, extravagant sort of men, that don't care what they do— Why he was near running over old mother Barns yesterday, if it hadn't a been that his horse took fright at her as she screamed out for fear.” After much more such talk, the loquacious clerk departed. “My father appeared thoughtful all the morning, and seeing him still inclined to silence after the clerk left us, I first spoke— “I don't like the character nor the appearance of our new neighbour at all,” said father. “Neither do I,” said Margaret; “but we must keep this to ourselves.” “I have no fears but for you my child. He has the looks of a libertine, and how we are o behave to him I know not, but to offend him would be certain ruin to us both, he will certainly be here again, he has impudence enough to bear him out.” “I won't appear,” said I, “if he should come.” “Ah, that would not do Martha, that would enrage him, for you know that I could not tell him a falsehood, and he would resent it as an insult were he to learn the truth. “I think you had better go and spend a few weeks at Mr. Camel's, you will be safe there, and you can write to me every mail or two, so get ready as quick as you can, and take the stage in the morning.” “I was quite charmed to hear this—I was fond of Mr. Camel's family; it was one of those I had visited since my return from school. To Mr. Camel's I went, the distance being only seven miles, I arrived there before dinner the next day. “You may guess my surprise upon entering the house to find the same gentleman there who was with lord D. at my father's the preceding night. I was presented to him in spite of my objections to the contrary. He was a nephew of Mr. Camel, and a lieutenant in the army. He had just got leave of absence a few days to visit his uncle, and being acquainted with lord D. he had accompanied him, with several other young men, from London —his name was Warberton “These particulars I had learned from Lucretia, the eldest Miss Camel. I must confess I felt a partiality for this young man at first sight, which perhaps only arose from the contrast between him and his impertinent companion. “I was both pleased and sorry to meet this young man —I was pleased, I could not tell why, and was sorry that my purpose would be completely defeated, as through him lord D. would discover my retreat. Shortly after my arrival dinner was announced, and the Lieutenant and myself were placed directly opposite to each other at table. “I dare say I never behaved so awkwark in my life; I shall remember it while I live. I let my fork fall first, and then my knife—I was so confused at these accidents that when I was asked what I would have, I would say sir, when I ought to have said madam. “I never looked at Warberton during the time, and the moment I could rise with decency I made my escape —took one of the little girls with me and withdrew to one of the chambers, fully determined not to appear at the table while Warberton remained in the house. “The two elder Miss Camels came into the chamber shortly afterwards and would have had me return to the parlour, but I refused, saying I was not very well, and besides I did not like to be in company with strangers. They insisted, but I positively refused—and they left me. “Their mother came in some time afterwards and expressed much uneasiness that I was unwell. She sat with me some time and then left me to prepare tea, saying a cup of tea would relieve me. “Now, thought I, I shall be obliged to appear, or affront the family. When tea was ready the girls came again, saying— “You shall go, Martha, and take tea with the handsome Lieutenant, he is in raptures with you, he related the adventure of going to your house, and how impudent lord D. was at your father's. He said he was mad enough to beat him for the language he used to you. “Come, come along, it's nothing but a love fit, Martha, nothing else in the world.” “Come, fix your ruffles and curls neat,” said little Ann, “I want you to look pretty.” I followed them to the parlour, and took the remotest seat I could find. “I had not been long seated before Warburton came and sat down by me, observing, this was a pleasure quite unexpected, that he little thought of seeing me again so soon, and asked if I was not much displeased at their intrusion at my father's. “I replied that I was very much hurt at the impertinence of lord D. as you call him.” “I saw that you were hurt, which made me urge him to depart. Indeed I objected to going in, but lord D. seeing you by the light of the candle, which was burning near you, whispered “Do you see that, Warberton? by the Lord I'll go in, I don't care who lives here.” “I told Warberton I hoped I should never see him again. I had not uttered the last word before lord D. was in the room! and almost at the same instant the servant entered with tea. I took a cup, but my terror was such at the sight of this hated man, that Warberton had to take the cup out of my hand. I told him I believed I would retire. “Miss Cary, favour us with your presence,” said he, “you will get over this presently.” “In the meantime lord D. had saluted the rest of the family, and stepping up to where we were, accosted Warberton thus: “By G—d Warberton you're in fine business—I fancy you'll cut me out with the parson's daughter.” “Warberton's face kindled at this, and without noticing the vulgar observation, asked him “if he should have the pleasure of making him acquainted with his uncle's family?” and introduced him very coldly; after which he took his seat again by my side, and asked lord D. how he was so fortunate as to find the way; adding that his presence was a pleasure quite unexpected. “— Why, he just came on—sometimes he was right, and sometimes he was wrong.—Cursed fools don't know one road from another--I might as well have asked for the man in the moon, as to ask for Mount-pleasant, (the name of Mr. Camel's seat.) I missed it only a few miles.” “Mr. Camel, hearing this, asked if he had dined— he had not, and a cold cheek was prepared for him in the dining-room. I was glad to hear this, as I intended once more to make my escape to my room. I observed to Warberton that I would retire, and hoped he would excuse me. “He remarked (which was very true) that it would be almost impossible to avoid lord D. while he remained in the neighbourhood, and it was as well to come to an understanding with him one time as another—that perhaps he flattered himself too much, but if he did not he would keep his seat, and if his lordship offered any disrespectful language to me, he would affront him.” “I objected to this, alleging that it would involve him in a quarrel with lord D. perhaps, which would render me unhappy. The word escaped me inadvertently, nor did it escape the notice of Warberton. But before he had time to reply I said, I would be very sorry on account of Mr. Camel's family, to whom I was under many obligations.” “Make yourself easy, madam,” said he, “his lordship is no ways dangerous, I know him too well, and he knows me full as well.” “Lord D. having dined, returned to the parlour, and throwing a sarcastic glance at Warberton, entered into conversation with the elder Miss Camel. In short in the course of an hour, getting up from his chair, he approached Warberton, and accosted him with-- “Well, Warberton, I was going to invite you to ride home with me, but I suspect your inclination leads you to stay where you are, and by heavens if I was in your shoes I would not see Woodgrove to-night.” “You can do as you please, my lord,” said the other. “Why, to tell the truth I would be glad of your company, it's so cursed lonesome, that is, I don't wish to intrude upon your time, Ned, or upon your pleasures, but 26* I hate to go without you. Clark and I and the Steward last night, no one else, Robertson and D. rode out in the evening, they had not returned when I left home.” “Well, order the horses,” said Warberton, “I'll go.” “While lord D. was absent, Warberton said he was sorry to leave his uncle's that evening; but he would go to get his lordship off, that he was the most unpleasant acquaintance he had—he found it impossible to shake him off to-day, and see, he has followed me; if he had any delicacy he would not have come here without an invitation.” “Their horses came, and they left Mr. Camel's, and again I was glad and sorry. “They were hardly out of sight, when the Miss Camels both observed “they were glad they were gone.” “Why he's the greatest fool I ever saw,” said Lucretia; “but come into our chamber, Martha, I have something to tell you.” “I followed them into the room. “You have come in good time, Martha; I was going to send for you to assist me—I am afraid I will not be ready in time. You must know that I am to be married Thursday-week, and I wish you to assist me in getting ready—and you must be bride's-maid too.” “I felt rather in a delicate situation, and was afraid I had intruded: and told them candidly “that I came up to avoid Lord D—. I knew that it was expected Miss Camel would be married to a gentleman whom I had often seen there, but had no idea that it was so near.” “Yes, indeed, and I am very glad you came to-day. Cousin Ned is going to stay till it is all over with me,” said she, laughing, “and so let us get to work. I am glad they are gone, as they would only have hindered us.” “I wrote to my father in the first place, and then assisted the ladies. All three sat down to sew; the old lady was very busy arranging matters for the occasion. We kept the little girl (Ann) to run errands for us, and the old man amused us with funny stories. “Every one was employed, from the oldest to the youngest. The girls did rally me a little about Cousin Ned: but we were too busily, and too seriously engaged to spend our time in jesting. “Hang that ugly lord,” said Sarah. (the second daughter) “how impudent he looks—don't you hate him, Martha?” “I told her “I certainly had very little love for him.” “And he talked so impudent to Cousin,” said Ann, “when he was sitting by Miss Martha; I could have slapped his jaws. He thinks because he's a lord, he can talk big—he's nothing but a fool for all his gold lace. I always thought a lord was some grand thing—why, he hasn't half as much sense as Cousin. If that be a lord, keep lords from me.” “Next morning, after breakfast, we had resumed our work but a short time, before Warberton was announced. “Now he will hinder us,” said Lucretia; “I wish he had staid away until I had my robe trimmed.” “We won't admit him,” said I—“let the old gentleman keep him company.” “I had hardly said this, when Warberton stood in the chamber door. “May I come in, ladies?” “No, you must not, indeed Cousin,” said Sarah, pushing him out. But it was all in vain. “Why ladies,” said he, “you have a world of work here,” after saluting, and seating himself. “I can sew very well, give me a needle, I'll assist you,” taking up some of the work. “Get you gone—I wonder how you come to find us out,” said Sarah. “The old gentleman, who had been listening all the while, now bolted in, laughing. “Why it was all my doings, girls; I sent him—I wouldn't have missed the fun for a crown.” “In short, Wharberton remained there the whole week, the most of his time in our company. None of us enquired after lord D—, but little Ann; she asked “how he was, and what he said?” “Warberton answered “that he was well, and very much pleased with his new acquaintances.” “It's more than we are of him, then,” said Ann; “I'll bet my life pa invites him to sister's wedding, and that's just what he came for.” “When we completed our work, which we did in five days. I was forced to go home. I had clothes suitable for the occasion, but not dreaming of such a thing, I brought nothing but a few ordinary dresses from home. “There was the carriage,” said Mrs. Camel, “Sarah can go with you, and Ned will escort: he will go with pleasure. I dare say. You can set out early in the morning—I'll have an early breakfast, and you can return by dinner; you will have no time to lose, for I dare say when you come to look, you will have many things to fix too.” This was Tuesday evening. “I did not approve the plan altogether, as I thought it might not please my father, to see me so young as I was (only seventeen) so familiar with a stranger; however, I made no objection, and we set out accordingly. “When I arrived at home, I had to introduce War, berton of course, to my father, and retiring to my chamber with Sarah, procured such things as I wanted, and was ready to return to Mr. Camel's in less than an hour. “While I had been engaged in the chamber, my father in a conversation he had with Warberton, discovered he was the son of an old school-fellow of his youthful days, and here was great joy at the discovery; but Sarah and I broke in upon it, alleging there was no time to spare, they would see each other again—for my father was to ride his poney up at his leisure the same evening, as he was to marry Miss Camel. “We returned in time for dinner, and every thing was got ready for the occasion, and as little Ann had foretold, lord D— was invited, together with several gentlemen who came with him from London, and some from the neighbourhood, about twelve or thirteen in all, and as many ladies, all strangers to me. Warberton and myself were the attendants on the bride.—After the ceremony, dinner, &amp;c. was over, we all stood up to dance; lord D— desired me for a partner, I was engaged of course to Warberton. “By G—d, he is a d—n clever fellow.” “He said this, though not intentionally, in Warberton's hearing. “Not quite so clever as your lordship, but I am clever enough to support my privilege,” said Warberton. No reply was made, and the dance commenced, my lord providing himself with a partner from among the guests. “My feelings were much wounded in the course of the evening, by the females of the party—`who is she?' `who is she?' some would ask. `O, she is nothing but old parson Cary's daughter.'—`Humph!' another would say, `she gives herself a great many airs, to be-sure: I wonder at the Camels for inviting the poor thing, she will only expose herself.' “This was heard both by Warberton and myself—I was very near bursting into tears, made several blunders in the dance, and would have made a great many more, had it not been for my partner, who saw my confusion, and knowing the cause, engaged me in conversation. “I suppose I must tell the whole truth? said Mrs. Cary, at this part of her story. “Yes, indeed madam,” said Mary, “I know you have slipped over a great deal already, that I would much rather have heard than that which you have told, for I am sure that lieutenant must have said many handsome things to you while you were in the carriage together, and during the five days you spent at Mrs Camel's.” “Oh, its so long ago that I have forgotten, Mary.” She resumed— “While the ladies were indulging in their ill-natured remarks, the gentlemen were engaged in those of a different sort—`I'll swear she is an angel!'—`is she that old man's daughter? why, I have been at his church often, I never saw any one but himself, I thought he was an old bachelor?'—`Oh, she was at school all her life, she was never at home.'—`Who is that partner of hers? good-looking fellow, they are in love with each other, I'll bet my salvation'—`And I'll go you halves,' said another; `but they had better have been asleep, for he will soon be ordered to the East Indies, so I understand from his superiors: and then I suspect, the divine creature will grieve herself to death.' “When we finished the set, I was glad you may be sure—I said I was not well, and would walk into the dining-room for air; Warberton led me thither, and persuaded me to try a glass of wine. Whilst we remained there, what I had expected took place—that was, that he declared—” “He was your devoted admirer,” said Mary, “for you will never get it out yourself—now go on.” “It was something like it,” said Mrs. Cary, and resumed, “To be brief, I danced no more that night. I returned, however, to the ball-room, and continued there about an hour, with feelings none of the pleasantest. Lord D— seeing me disengaged, approached, enquiring after my health, and `would I honour him with my company the next set?' and abundance of stuff. “My replies were all short, cold, and decisive. He turned off from me much displeased, and I continued to look on for some time, when making an apology to Mrs. Camel, I retired alone to my chamber, where I remained until the company broke up. “I should have been glad to have returned home the next day, but the family would by no means consent.— The following day, however, I would go home: my father had returned the next after the wedding. “Mrs. Chambers, (Miss Camel that was.) said, “we will have an early dinner, and see you safe home.” “After dinner, Mrs. Chambers, Sarah, and myself got into the carriage, Mr. Chambers and Warberton on horseback, and thus accompanied I reached home. The ladies would not alight, fearing it would be late, and as soon as Warberton assisted me out of the carriage, they returned, and I determined not to leave home shortly. I was very low-spirited all the evening. “The East Indies ran in your head,” said Mary. Mrs. Cary resumed— “A great many things ran in my head, and that amongst the rest. A little after dusk, just as I was thinking of going to bed, who should knock at the door but lord D—, he made a great many apologies, he had been a hunting and thought the parson was alone, called to chat awhile, told my father he had never been to see him yet. I arose and went to my chamber, without a word of apology, and went to bed. He had no attendant whatever. “Next day about ten o'clock Warberton came. After some conversation between him and my father, he told me he was going to London, and could not depart without coming to take leave; he said a great deal more, for he spent the day there. “Next morning, however, he set out for London. When he was about to depart, I requested him, as he was going by lord D's. to take him back with him to London, and informed him of his intrusion the preceding evening. “He replied, that if it would give me pleasure, he would be happy to comply with my request. He inforded me he would return in the course of two weeks, that his honour was pledged to return by a certain time to London, or he would not have left his uncles' so soon. The two weeks passed, and two weeks more, without my seeing Warberton. Meanwhile, my father suspecting an attachment, I confessed the truth. He was certainly the tenderest of parents, or it would have gone much harder with me than it did. Instead of chiding as most parents would have done, he endeavoured to sooth and comfort me. Lord D. still remained at his seat, or galloping over the country, rather, with his hounds and his hunting, to the great annoyance of the poor. He would often call at my father's, and try to draw me into conversation, which I repelled with the utmost disdain. One morning however, he called and asked me if I had heard from Warberton since he went to London? I answered I had not. He has gone to the East Indies, said he —His company was ordered there last week— poor Warberton, he is a good soul, but he will hardly live to return—the climate there makes great havoc of our people. After he uttered this speech, which nearly annihilated me, he looked me in my face to see how I bore the news, with a brutal triumph, and shortly left the house. Although Warberton had never hinted any thing of the sort to me, yet upon revolving every circumstance in my mind. I concluded that it must he true, and probably he had not heard of his destination when he left our neighbourhood; but that he should quit the country without letting us know, without writing, was unaccountable! You will all guess how I felt upon hearing this intelligence. My father was alarmed for my situation, and strove by every argument in his power to reconcile me, remarking what he had always done, that this was a world of sorrow, and begged of me to be patient, and resigned to the will of my maker. I think it was a week after hearing this news, my father and myself had been sitting up reading, the clock had struck nine—my father had laid down his book and glasses. Old Margaret had a wine posset sitting by the fire for him to drink upon lying down, as he complained of a cold. Lord D. (our daily visitor, the clerk informed us) set out for London, perhaps the next day from that on which he communicated the unpleasant news. Old Margaret having arranged every thing for the night, was in the act of pulling off my father's stockings, and I had set off to my chamber, when a bold wrap at the door alarmed us. The door was opened by Margaret, and Warberton entered! He apologized for intruding, and said that he arrived late at the next village, where he had left his horses, and walked across the fields afoot, being anxious to know how we were. My father observed, when you entered the house, I could'nt tell whether it was you or your ghost, as we heard you had sailed to the Indies. He replied that he came very near it, but I suspect you received a letter (addressing himself to me) which explained my situation. “No I received no letter,” said I. He was amazed. “No letter!” “No.” “Well that exceeds all the rest!” he exclamed, and seemed for some time lost in thought. At length he resumed, as it is late, I will return to the village, and call in the morning. My father objected, telling him he would send Daniel to see about his horse—he must be tired, and must tarry all night.—Go, said my father to Margaret, and prepare supper. He had supped at the tavern, and expressed something about giving trouble. Make yourself happy, said my father, we are lonesome —the obligation will be on our side, and he consented to stay. Margaret was desired to prepare a bed, and he retired to his chamber, and I to mine. Next morning he gave us the following account:— “When I went to London, I was surprised to find the regiment to which I belonged, under marching orders to the East Indies. The Colonel of my regiment, had changed places with another Colonel, who with his regiment were actually ordered to the East Indies before my visit to see my uncle Camel; and this new arrangement, had just taken place the day before my arrival in the city. “I sought my Colonel, and remonstrated against such proceeding, saying “I would resign rather than go.” “He advised me to get a man to take my place—that several of the officers had already done so—he would aid me with his interest, and perhaps for a small sum, I might prevail on some of the officers, then under him, to take my place. Money, he said, he had not, but he would do any thing else in his power. “I went to my new Colonel, and obtained a parole for a week or ten days. I found great difficulty in obtaining this leave, it took up several days. “I had a maiden aunt in the cuntry, who was very fond of me, and as she, I knew, could assist me though very covetous; yet I expected, rather than see me go to the 27 East Indies, she would advance me a small sum, which she did. She gave me five hundred pounds, and I returned. “My old Colonel and myself next thing obtained a man, or at least his promise, to go in my stead, for which I was to give him three hundred pounds. Then he set sail. It was after this arrangement I wrote to you. “I waited on my new Colonel, and gave him to understand my determination not to march with the regiment, and that I had provided a person to take my place. “He replied, that I ought not to be quite so sure; he didn't think he could let me off. “In short, after much perplexity and trouble, I sold my commission, and have bid adieu to the army. “Before I left London, however, I learned that lord D. was at the bottom of the whole, and it has been through his means, no doubt, that the letter has been purloined; for he was base enough to bribe my servant in cases of equal turpitude.” Warberton finished his story, and many others, which it is needless to dwell on: and waving other particulars, we were married not long afterwards, resolving to encounter every difficulty. “We, however, had prospects on both sides; Warberton expected to inherit the property of his old covetous aunt already named, which he did—and my father had expectations of a similar sort from an uncle of his, who lived in Boston, a very old man and a very great miser: he was his grand-uncle, had never been married, and would not have given a dollar from all accounts, to have saved the lives of a whole parish. “We lived with my father, though Warberton rented a small piece of ground, which he would often cultivate himself, while I would sit under a shade hard by. In the course of a year I was the mother of a beautiful boy.” Here she became extremely affected. “When he was about a year old, which was nearly two years after our marriage, my husband's aunt died, and left him, exclusive of some trifling legacies, the whole of her estate: which though not more than half as much as he had conjectured, amounted (furniture and all) to eleven hundred peunds, but we owed nearly half of the sum. “However, in about six months the old miser in Boston died, and my father understood by letter, that he had bequeathed him two valuable houses, a large quantity of goods, and ten thousand dollars in cash. Here again we were disappointed; we had expected three times as much—but he had thought proper to endow public institutions with it. “My father and my husband now concluded to remove to the United States as quick as possible, and pursue the mercantile business there without delay. It was settled that my father should go, as the heir, and take possession of the property in America, and my husband and I could follow as soon as we could make final arrangements for quitting England forever. This was in the fall, and we determined to sail in the spring. “Accordingly, my father left England and arrived safe in Boston. We set sail in March following, and had a favourable voyage until we arrived at Newfoundland, when a dreadful storm arose, in which the ship and cargo was lost, and only four persons escaped. “Had we taken to the boat at the beginning of the tempest, I am of the opinion we could all have been saved, as we were not far from land; but the captain thought there was no danger, when the ship in an instant of time, was dashed to pieces. The boat, however, was got into the water, and my husband ran to give the child out of his hands to assist me into the boat, and I never saw him since. The moment he left me, a sailor caught me by the arm and cried out, `bear a hand here,' and assisted by another he lifted me into the boat, and jumped in at the same instant with three others, when the boat was swept from the ship by a wave mountain-high, before another soul got in, and the last I heard of the ship was that she was going down. “The second wave, however, dashed the boat against a rock, shivered it to pieces, and we gave ourselves up for lost. I caught hold of one of the sailors, as he says, though I remember nothing of it, and begged of him not to leave me: for they had seen a light as they thought, while they were taking breath, and the next wave swept them from the boat and threw them on the shore—I held fast to the man, I first caught hold of, and the generous creature never offered to disengage me; four of us only escaped, one, if there was one, was drowned. We were hospitably entertained by the people of the island, who lived in wretched hovels, and had very few of the comforts of life. “About six o'clock in the morning, the wind ceased, and these people ventured out to see what discovery they could make. They were out all day; when they returned, what I related was confirmed. They saw nothing but a few spars of the ship floating on the surface of the water. “I spent two days on the Island, and during the time, the kindness I received from the man who saved my life, was never exceeded. “I was in every respect an object of pity, it being but a short time after that calamity, before I had Martha. “We now set sail for Boston—my kind friend whom I wished to reward, attended me thither. In the meantime, my father had received news, that the Phœnix[13] [13] The name of our ship. was wrecked, and every soul lost. You may guess his joy at our meeting—he devoted all his attention to me. “Being very ill when I landed, three of the best physicians in the place attended me night and day.—Martha was born the sixth day after I landed. “I recovered very slow, it was six or seven weeks before I left my chamber. “My father wrote often to St. Johns' to enquire about the fate of the Phenix. All the intelligence he obtained, was that the whole was lost. Being bereaved of my husband and son, I resumed the name of Cary. “My father never enjoyed his health after he came to America. I shall always think, that the shock he received at the news of our having perished at sea, was ultimately the cause of his death. “He lamented deeply the death of my husband, and still more his little Cyrus, which was my son. “The business of a merchant, required more application than he was able to bestow; and besides, he was involved in a vexacious law suit, on account of some claim against the estate he inherited. At length he sold out his stock, and quit the business of merchant. “It was with infinite grief, I saw him gradually sinking to the grave, which he did in about six years after he came to the United States. “Meanwhile, the law suit was still pending, nor was it determined until about four years since, when it went against my father's estate, though I have all the reason in the world to believe, that had justice been done, and the proper attention been paid to it, he would have proved successful. “I was now thrown poor, and destitute, on a pitiless world. I had bestowed on Martha, the best education the country afforded—my whole attention had been devoted to her. “We were now stripped almost of every thing. I had to give up the house; what money I had, was spent in defending the suit, and the property hardly paid the cost. Martha and I, had our clothes and jewels, and about fifty or sixty dollars in cash; we were however blessed with health, and bore the misfortune better than might be expected. “I rented a small house, and Betsey Watson, whom I had almost reared in my family, Martha, and myself, took in work, and maintained ourselves comfortably, and in this humble situation it was Mary, that fortune and my son, as I may now call him, brought you to my home.” Mrs. Cary having finished her narrative, Mary, as though she wished to dispel the melancholy impressions it occasioned, observed, “You forgot to tell us, madam, what lord D. said, and how he behaved, when his treacherous plan was defeated—of all things I should like to have seen him then.” “His disappointment was a complete triumph.” Mrs. Cary replied, “I never heard, but lord D. was a notorious coward—Warberton had saved him from being caned, a few days only prior to their visit to Woodgrove, by taking up the quarrel himself; and although he was convinced to a certainty that lord D. and no other, 27* was the principal in promoting the alteration in the arrangement of the army—he never resented it, at least to my knowledge, as in the first place he conceived lord D. beneath his notice, and in the second place it would have displeased my father.” Thus ended Mrs. Cary's narrative of her eventful life. It was evident from her modesty and extreme sensibility, she suppressed those parts of it which would have rendered it more entertaining. It was, however, very moving, and frequently drew tears from some of us —we were silent several minutes, when it was interrupted by my uncle, who fetching a deep sigh, said— “Let's have some wine—these seas have been a sore scourge to us all—albeit it seems as 'twere ordained. —'Didn't think any body so bereav'd as myself—” I broke in upon him here, by telling Jinkins “he must entertain us, agreeably to promise, the next evening with the particulars of his life.” “Ah,” said my uncle, “Dick 'll have to get me to help him out wi' his story.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIX. The following evening, after supper, we reminded Jinkins of his promise. He replied as follows: “It was true enough what the Commodore observed, that he knew nothing at all of the particulars of his life, but what were equally or better known to him.” “I told thee I'd have to lend a hand—thee shall promise a heap o' things—Now I have got the weather-gage —such as that Algerin' story, thee always flies to,” said he, smiling. “Well, well, be it so,” said Jinkins, “tell the company what you know.” “Why, first thing as I knows about 'um, 'was a little urchin, 'board a ship—I was settin' talkin' in the cabin with some o' the men—that, I believe was on a voyage to the East Indies, so we were talkin', and drinkin' our wine, when hark! we hears a child cry—'never was more astonished—rung for the Steward, what do I hear, comrade? be there a child below? sure there's no women aboard.” “There's no women aboard,” said the boy. “But there be's a child.”—“How comes that?” “It is Jack Jinkins' child.” “That's a clever thing—it were to be dinged with the noise o' children. Say he must come hither, and gi' an account o' himself—soon come, walkin' slow, afeard, d'ye see, 'was leading a little child by the hand. The tears was running down its—cheeks. I took it in my lap, and wiped its face wi' my handkerchief—it was soothed, looked up in my face and said pa, and smiled so coaxin', d'ye see, that 'forgot I was to a been mad with Jack for bringin' it aboard. “But what be ye doin' wi' the child, and where be its mother? thinkin' 'twas his own, and that he had slipped her aboard unknown to me.” “Why drowned; sure I told your honour the whole crew were lost, but myself and the child. I hated to tell ye about as how 'was takin' it to England, and thought your honour would oppose it.” “And how be ye goin' to take him to England, when we're on our way to the Indies?” “Then suppose, your honour, we never meets a ship to thae parts.” “But why do 'send it to England?” “Because as how its relations live there, and they ha' the best right to be bothered wi' it” “And who do'st think would be troubled wi' thy brats?” “It's none of mine, sure—I told you who its father and mother was.” “'Got so mad, 'told him if 'come athawrt him 'would shiver his upper works—ordered him out o' my sight, 'cause he couldn't come by the truth. So it passed on; but as 'was saying, my heart warmed to the child, and 'twas a fine little rogue too—Sambo nursed it and took care on't, and it prattled and would climb on my knee; it was glad to be where it could see the light—so I makes a mighty pet on't, 'twould sleep in my bosom, 'twas a mischievous little dog too, it was clean spoiled, never stir, we had a monkey aboard, and atween it and the monkey 'was always complaints o' pranks or one mishap or another, 'think it couldn't be less than a score o' china cups and them sort o' things broke wi' it every day. Thee may well laugh,” said my uncle, seeing Jinkins unable to resist it any longer. “Why did you let me be so bad then? why did you not give me the cat?” “Ah, thee knows 'wouldn't a hit thee, Dick for the world. Well, it all passed on in this here sort o' way: made several voyages, always took him along, 'would a'cried himself to death to a'been left behind see, and Sambo had a liking for it, but 'thought how't must have some learning and like o' that, how was't to be come at. Wouldn't agree to part wi' me, thee minds that, can't ye?” to Jinkins. “Yes sir, I mind that—I was a very bad boy when you plead with me to stay in England, and gave me a horse and a gold watch, to hire me to go to school.” “Just so, 'wouldn't a'stayed for all the horses and watches in Christendom—and what do'st do, but takes a man aboard to learn him to read and write, and he took to it himself, after that 'had no trouble wi' him, 'got ashamed and got books and learned French, and all them sort o' things—'dare say he's as high learned as the best o' 'um. But I tell'ee what, Dick's spunk, 'understands the main tack, try him who will, never see'd the like—if he didn't take up a quarrel when 'was but a lad, that took place 'tween a great hulk o' a fellow ('twas big enough to swallow him) and me: the fellow talk't impudent to me, and zucks, if Dick didn't light upon like a gull, and made him strike in a twinkling; and another time, when 'was coming home wi' a rich cargo, my fellows mutinied and 'was laying a plan, d'ye-see, to murder me and some o' them that they knew would be for me: he was but a bit o' a boy, but so it was, he happened to get wind o' it and come straight and told me. Yes, Dick's spunk, though 'wouldn't find it out by him; now thee may tell all that thee knows.” Before Jinkins had time to reply, the landlord entered, ushering a man whom from his dress I took to be a sailor, saying as he introduced him, “here is a man who wishes to see you, Captain Burlington.” “Why, if it bean't Jack, as I live,” said my uncle, giving him a shake of the hand—“just talking about thee, old swab.” The stranger then saluted Jinkins, to whom and my uncle he appeared well known. He was then presented to the company by the name of Jinkins, and almost the first word my uncle addressed to him was, “Did'ee find him? was it the same?” “Yes, your honour, for that matter, I found him.” “Charles, give him something to wet his pipes, he's as good a tar, he's the fellow that saved Jinkins, you'll hear now.” After drinking a glass of rum, (he would not touch wine) he continued. “Yes, I found him out.” “And what dids't do with him?” “I did nothing with him—what could I do? I couldn't prove that he stole the money, though I could swore to it—that is, I could swear as how no one else could have took it—but the justices, whatever they be, said that was no evidence. “And so thee did nothing by thy long voyage?” “No, nothing at all.” “And where did thee leave him?” “I left him just where I found him, in Halifax.” “And art thee sure 'twas the same tar?” “To be-sure I am—isn't here the self-same pocket-book that the money was in? I made him give it up to me, after drinking friends at a tavern,” said Jinkins, pulling out a pocket-book as he spoke. “I told him now I am sorry for that shipmate, to go back for the young man's sake, he will expect me to bring him some news, and here I am broke up.” “Why, the money, I thought, says he, was your own?” “Curse the money, says I—I don't care a rope's-end about the money, it is the pocket-book and the papers that was in it I want: and so he made me give him the word of a sailor, and that you know is sacred, not to hurt or harm him, and so he took me to his lodging, and gave me the pocket-book, and here it is—it's the very same, I knew it the moment I saw it, though the scape-gallows has greased and bedaubed it so, but I don't think you'll make head or tail of the contents, (opening it) though he said there's the same papers,” handing the whole to young Jinkins. The pocket-book proved to be Warberton's! Here was another of the indescribable scenes. Notwithstanding all Dick's heroism, it was some time before he could ask the elder Jinkins—“My father, you say, gave you this?” “Yes.” Jinkins then looked at Mrs. Cary, as if to prepare her for what was to follow. “What was the name of the ship?” “The Phœnix, Captain Broomfield,” answered the elder Jinkins. Dick then advanced to Mrs. Cary, and thus addressed her: “These are your husband's papers, madam, and I must be your son!” She uttered a shriek, and rushed into his arms.—He held her some time to his breast, while Martha petrified with amazement, was waiting to embrace her brother. Every one present was mute with astonishment. “I give you joy,” said I, going up to Mrs. Cary, and taking her hand. The rest followed my example. After mutual congratulations, the elder Jinkins was desired to explain. He in the first place, desired an explanation on his part, his astonishment being greater than ours. He asked Mrs. Cary “if she was on board the Phœ nix when she was wrecked?” She replied in the affirmative. “How were you saved?” said he. She informed him as already related. “I don't see into it,” said Jack, musing, “and I saw the boat,” said he, “but did not see you in it, but you might, for it was all hurly-burley: but the boat was overwhelmed in the sea.” “Yes indeed, it was split to pieces in a short time after I entered it: but by a miracle, I and three others were thrown on the shore. But, dear sir, do tell me how you and my son were saved?” “Why, when the ship split, when it made that great crack just as they were getting out the boat, a gentleman I had often seen on deck came to me, with a child in his arms, and says, `here, friend, save my child, and take all that's in this,' handing a pocket-book, which is this same that I brought here to-night. When he said this, he said he `must go down for his wife,' and I never saw him afterwards, for the ship went to pieces before you could say Jack Robinson. “I took the pocket-book and stuffed it in my bosom, not that I cared for the money, and holding the child with one arm, I tied myself fast with a rope to one of the spars, and wave after wave rolled over poor Dick and I. The most of the crew went to the bottom at once, and the rest were soon swept from the wreck. I heard the cries of those in the boat, and all on a sudden it ceased. I thought all was lost; the wind and the waves whirled me in a trice, God knows where; some times under water and sometimes out: but as he would have it, I still kept hold of Dick until day-light, when a New York trader took us in, it being calm. And what became of your husband?” “He was drowned.” “Yes, I thought as much, and I couldn't have stood it much longer—was high dropping off, when I was discovered. Well, well,” said he, thoughtfully, “and so you are my Dick's mother, if that don't beat the mermaid.” “Go on and tell the lady the balance of the story,” said my uncle, “we was just speakin' o' it before thee come in.” “Why there is no more about it, I went to Havana. You engaged me to go with you to the East Indies, and you had like to have give me a basting about taking the child aboard; but I knew when you found out that I had it aboard, your heart was so tender, you would befriend it, when you came to know it was a poor little motherless babe.” “Why t' d— I don't thee haul thy wind, and tell about the money, and the man that stole it.” “Why your honour, the man stole the money, and there was the last of it.” “Humph,” said my uncle, peevishly. “And did you lose the money,” said Mrs. Cary, “after all your trouble?” “No, indeed madam—I went as I tell you to Havana, I was acquainted with his honour here, and thought he would want me about that time. I had been to England.—As he said he would'nt sail for two or three months, and a'body hates idleness, and so I got good wages, and went, and there I was engaged by the captain of the Phenix; very well, I wanted to return any how, he gave me good wages too, but had high proved a dear bargain to me, in the long run. So as I was saying, I went to Havana, and one of the cursed crew of the sailors, belonged to the ship that took me and little Dick (as, I called him) in, stole my pocket-book, and all that was in it, and cleared himself, and I never heard a breath of him from that day to this, until I lauded here this fall, with his honour the captain, here, when meeting with an old mesmate, he told me as Clark (that was his name) was in Halitax, and so to please his honour, and Dick being old voyager, I have just been to see him. "He was an ungenerous dog that's to a certainty. After giving him, and every one of them a crown a piece, and that was more than I got myself; but it's all one, I shall never miss it, his honour and Dick will never forsake old Jack." "And how did it happen that you called him "Jinkins"? said Mrs, Gary, " did you riot discover my husband's name on the papers ?" "To tell God's truth, I never saw the papers. and I could'nt read if I had. But as I was saying, I was in a bad trim, when the trader took us in, and was as you may say, all one as dead, that day and he next, and could give no accoung of myself. And when I got the use of my speech, and revived a little, I told all about the disaster, and being told the trader was bound to Havana, the very place I wished to go. I made myself easy, thinking to get some body, when I landed, to look into the matter, and send the child to its friends, if they could be heard of. But the very day we landed, the thief stole the pocket-book. So I spliced my own name to the child, and called him Dick, after a brother of mine--and I believe he ,just did as well, don't you think so Dick?" "I do sir, I shall always be proud of the name, and still more of him who gave it to me." This brought the tear in Jacks eye--he wiped it hastily. and resumed,-- "But I am glad you have found your mother, child-- It's more than I ever expected, for you know I always told you that the whole ship's crew was drowned." My uncle finding he had done, went on, "this that Jack has, just told, is what Dick was going to tell himseIf, as 'could remember it better, for 'never paid much heed to it.--Has thee had thy supper? said my uncle to Jack. "No sir, I was in such a hurry to see you, that I never waited for any thing." "Well take another glass o' the rum, and go get thee, just it, there, the same one 'it come in with'ee." "May be he'll not like to supper such a sailor-looking' fellow as I." If he says a word o' haarm to thee I'll give him my cane, seem as well as ever 'had om, in his life." "Why Ling, do you know me ?" Ling went to him, and wagged his tail." his tail. When Jack left us, all sat silent. It was the first time, since we had met, that none of us could find any thing to say; each seemed to doubt his senses. Mrs. Cary, and her son, eyed each other like; two bashful lovers. Martha looked at him also, though the tear of sensibility. would in spite of her white handkerchief, hold its destined place. Mary's mirth had forsaken her. Wilson. after some time, said, "this was a year prolific in wonders, and said he would never be surprised at any tiring after this." I asked Mrs. Cary. "if she had never discovered any resemblance of her husband in her son?" She replied, "I did sir, and a very striking one, and had often been upon the point of asking him about his parents; and to tell the tyruth, I began to hope this evening from the incidents of his childhood, and yet circumstances were so strong against me, that it appeared a mere chimera; but though I kept it to myself, I always thought he resembled his father. My husband was rather taller, but their features are very near the same." My uncle with some thing like conscious pride, observed "that Dick was a strim a las as you'll find atween stem and stern." "What will you do now, uncle," said I, "you and Mrs. Cary, you will be obliged to unite, as you are not I suspect willing to resign Jinking, and Mrs. Cary will not agree to give him up, I can't see what's to be done, unless you two marry, as he is a joing property." "You are a topping fellow for making matches," said Jinkins." "And here is Martha, and Fredinand too,in which you are alike interested--your children, are her children, and her children are your's--why you are almost man and wife, without the least trouble to yourselves." I was afraid to look at Mrs. Cary, after risking so much, but seeming as if my uncle was my exclusive object, I looked at him for a reply. The old gentleman was by no means unpleased. He replied, "Would'ent have' to marry the lady see, without she be's willing." All my efforts, however, to rally the spirits of the company failed. Wilson did make out to say. as lie seemed to awake from a long reverie, "I think we had better be setting off for home Mary, for if we stay here much longer, some mermaid from the deep may claim me for her swain." I just at that moment thought of Betsey, and turning toward her, "well Miss Watson," I said, "what do you think of this world ? are you not afraid the fairies will carry you off in some of their packs, one of these nights?" "I appear to be in a fairy land, said sire, "but I say my prayers every night; and my grand-mother always told me, that the evil spirits would have no power over me, if I said my prayers." "But if it should chance to be such a fairy as Jinkins or myself, Madam, for it happens that to close this tragic, comic, magazine of wonders, there must be two more weddings. But waving the subject for the present, Betsey, suppose you amuse us the balance of the evening, with the events of your life. It will, I dare say, confer a favour on us all, and myself in particular." She replied that, "like Mr. Jinkins, she would be obliged to refer to another, for she remembered nothing of her parents--that her friend Mrs. Cary, who had always treated her as her own child, was at liberty to indulge my curiosity, and was much more capable--that her life independently of the incidents in which Mrs. Cary was involved herself', with which you are already acquainted. would yield very little amusement." Mrs. Cary being thus appealed to, began as follows "Miss Watson's mother was a widlow, and being a near neighbour to me, when I first settled in America, became one of my first aquaintances ; she came to see me on the day I landed in Boston. I was at that time as distressed a being as ever existed, being afflicted both in body and mind, and Mrs. Watson being a woman of great humanity and feeling, sympathized with me, and endeavoured by the kindest attention, and the most endearing language to comfort me. She spent her time chiefly in my room, and I seemed lost when slre would leave me but fore a moment, to attend to tier household affairs. "She had lost her husband six months only before my arrival, and in the same instant almost she became a mother. She never had but one child, which is Betsey, who was then only six months old, which makes her six months older than Martha. The similarity of our misfortunes led to a friendship which will last to the end of our lives. Mrs. Watson had been genteely reared, but was in low circumstances; she had married against the consent of her parents, and they gave her nothing. "They were both dead, however, prior to my acquaintance with her, and she was to have received something at their death: but her brother, as she informed me, defrauded her out of it. Finally, I persuaded her to break up house-keeping and live with me: we were both lonely, and never happy but when we were together--I was rich, in comparison with her, who in the end became soleIy dependent on me for support. "At the end of three years, she was taken down on a bed of sickness and lingered about four months and some days, and died--leaving Betsey to me. With respect to her child, she said she had no fears; she died happy, in the full assurance, that I would be a mother to her. I was much affected at her death, and have never seen a person, that is a stranger, either before or since for whom I had so strong an attachment. And as to Betsey. I might, but I don't think I ever made any difference between her and Martha--I sent her to the same school, nor was one taught more, than the other. "When I was turned nut of house and home, I told Betsey that I could no longer support her, it was true, as she had hitherto lived: but if she would share my adversity. as she had my prosperity, I would still be a mother to her--but left it to her option to stay or go elsewhere she thought she could do better. Sihe said nothing would induce her to leave me; indeed, she was much hurt that I mentioned the subject to her. But, poor child--" "Ah, that's enough, mother," said Martha, "we are all happy now, so let us be thankful, instead of murmuring. I observed to them, upon retiring, "that I should set out for New-York probably in two days. and should be glad if any of them felt disposed for a jaunt, to have the pleasure of their company." No one accepted the invitation, but Jinkins. He looked at his mother first, and then at my uncle, with one of those fascinating smiles, which he never wants, and observed, that "He would willingly accompany me, if lie could get the consent of iris father and mother." Mrs. Cary blushed, and replied "that as she never had any controul over him, she would exercise none." The Commodore said, "I hates for thee to be away, 'is such a cunning dog, keeps one in heart." "I am sure you have friends enough here to amuse you: you can play whist with Wilson for a partner, you can treat Ferdinand and Mary, and when tired of that, you can beguile my mother into matrimony, by relating some of your by-past achievements Surprising you should always want me hanging about you." "Pshaw! pshaw! quit thee nonsense, Dick--but 'spose 'must go. But I'll not forget thy impudence a whit 'less o' that, talking so to thy mother--'is a saucy fellow, madam--he be indeed." "Oh," said Mrs. Cary, "he is only jesting, sir, to make us old folks laugh: he means no disrespect.'' Jinkins and I retired to our room shortly after this, taking old,Jack with us to lull us to sleep with his sea. adventures. Next morning I waited on Hunter, to know his commands, to New-York. He gave me a, letter to his wife, and one to his father: and the following day, accompanied by Jinkins, Iset out to New-York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXX. THE first person I visited in New-York, was Doctor N--, and enquired for Mrs. Hunter. "She was not perfectly well," he said, "but would be in a few days." As every minute seemed an age, which detained me from Clarissa, I hastened to her house. After enquiring how she was, I told lrer my name was Burlington, and was glad to find her so well. She attempted to speak, but utterance failed her: I sat by her side, with her hand in mine, but remained siIent until tire first burst of feelings had subsided. When she became a little composed, I told her "to be comforted: I came to make her happy, and assist her, by every means in my power." Still she essayed to speak, but still she faultered. At length she said, "I was going to thank you, Mr. Burlington: I was going to say how sorry I am for my conduct to your sister, but I see it would not be areeable to vou." "Dear madam, say nothing about it; Mary forgives you, and so do I from my heart; Mary is happy and independent. But excuse me, I have heard of your husband, and have a letter from him to you--the repents sincerely his conduct towards you: meantime I suspect his father is in this city, I have a letter for him, likewise, from his son.'' Having said this, I left her and returned to the inn, where I had left Jinkins, and taking him with me, we walked to Mr. L's. to enquire for Hunter; he gave us directions to his lodgings. Handing Hunter the letter, I retired with Jinkins until he should have, read it. I then confided to Jinkins that tire unfortunate man he and I befriended in the street, was Hunter's son. When we supposed Hunter had finished reading the letter. we returned and asked him "What news?" He replied, "the letter contained nothing but what he suspected I knew ; he refers me to you." I took the letter out of his hand; it ran thus:-- "Dear Father-- "This will be handed to you lay Mr. Burlington; he found me in the streets, starving for bread, and almost destitute of clothes. He took the to his lodgings, gave me money and clothes, and by his bounty I am now supported. I have a wife that is suffering too, of sickness and want. If you ever intend to give me any thing, I should think now is the time : I acknowledge my faults. and crave your pardon. Your repentant son. W. HUNTER." Hunter asked "where his son's wife was?" "She is in this city." Having replied to his question, I ran over the principal incidents of their elopement, marriage, and her subsequent distress, concealing the worst. Hunter was much mortified, and said very little.' After giving him directions to her house, I called on the McCallesters, who informed me Horton had arrived : as his establishment was a matter by no means to be lost sight of, it was necessary to come to an understanding with respect to his funds; for this purpose we called on him without loss of time. Horton informed us he had seven hundred dollars: Jinkins presented him with a draft for four hundred dollars, a present from my uncle; but I thought it best for Horton's interest to draw the money, and see the articles laid in--and thinking the whole little enough, Jinkins and I added two hundred more, and saw him properly installed in his grocery before we left him. Next day I called on Mrs. Hunter, who informed me that Hunter gave her fifty guineas, and advised her (as best for them both) to make it up with his son, and try him once more; that he was led to believe he vrould reform. She then handed me the letter from her husband-- it was as follows: "My dear injured wife, if I don't call you by that name can you forgive me ? but I know you cannot--indeed you ought not. I have for several flays been attempting to write to you, but found it impossible. I have written half a quire anti threw it away, because I could not express what I wished, and this is all I dare say until I hear from you. Your friend and mine, Mr. Burlington, is the bearer of this. "Your penitent W. HUNTER." "And what is your determination?" "To tell the truth, Mr. Burlington, I do not know-- I wish to go and see my mother, in the first place. I shall never be happy until I obtain her pardon: and my next wish is to see your sister once more, I have but two wishes in this world, and it is these. "I am afraid to trust Hunter, he has deceived me once already, by a show of compunction. But if he would renounce his former way of life, and pursue some honest means for a livelihood, I think I would be happier with him than in any other situation--but I will be advised by you." I told her "I was really at a loss--Hunter might be sincere, and I believed he was, but I could not undertake to guarranty for his subsequent conduct. I told her I could not think of her visiting Boston in her weak state --that she had better go to Philadelphia with Hunter and Jinkins, and I would myself visit her mother and sisters, obtain her pardon, and do all that was necessary. She burst into tears--"And am I not to see my mother, then?" said she. "Yes, dear Clarissa, I pledge you my honour you shall see her before I leave the country if I should take you there myself." I intended to add to the magazine of wonders, by presenting old Mrs. Simpson and her daughters at Philadelphia, (if they would go) as I could notthink of leaving them in their distressed situation, but this I kept to myself--leaving her there for the present, I took Jinkins on my way and called on Hunter. I informed him it was my wish that he should accompany his daughter-in-law to Philadelphia, as she was desirous of seeing my sister, Jinkins would accompany them and conduct him to his son, and that whatever he intended to bestow on him, I thought it nothing more than justice to settle a permanent support upon his wife. Perceiving by the letter that he was ignorant of his son's assumed name, I apprized him that he assumed the name of Smith, and that his wife had better adopt it also. I could not refrain from laughing at Jinkins after we left Hunter. "Damme if I like to have any thing to do with such a scape-gallows set, as they seem to be all round," said Jinkins. I replied "that is the very reason why, and the time when you ought to befriedn them--I mean when they are abandoned by the world." "Blast their eyes, I would give them the last penny I have, but I do not like to be caught travelling with them." "I am sorry it has so happened, but, dear Jinkins, to tell you the truth, I am afraid to trust this poor woman with Hunter, and although I joined your names for which I beg your pardon.) to save appearances, yet I would as soon trust her with the d----I as Hunter; and in fact I would trust her to very few, except yourself.-- And as for Hunter, he can go as he likes : and another thing, no one knows as much of the parties as you do-- you will have the pleasure (the honour if you will) of seeing the meeting between them. "I will write to Mary by you, I wish her to receive the letter before she sees Mrs. Hunter,this you will attend to." We walked on to a mercantile house, where I purchased ten thousand dollars worth of goods for myself, and the same amount for Wilson. and consigned them to the care of T. &amp; Co. of New-Orleans. there to rernxirr till spring, when I proposed to be in Tennessee, and have them transported thence, as had been mutually agreed upon between Wilson and I, before I left Philadelphia. We had nothing to do now, but to take leave of Horton, my Irish friends, arid Doctor N----. When I returned, I took a sheet of paper, and wrote to Mary as follows:-- "Dear Mary--This will be Banded to you by Mr. Jinkins. Clarissa, your old acquaintance, is going with him to Philadelphia-she assumes the name of Smith. It is needless for me to tell you, what I know you will do, that is receive her kindly, and treat her well till I return; her husband will meet her there before long. I am going to Boston, and shall return as soon as possible. Adieu dear Mary." Next morning I saw Jinkins, and Mrs. Hunter, safely seated in a hack, and set off' before I left New-York. Old Hunter took a passage also, and so did I, he to Philadelphia, and I to Boston. It was some time after my arrival in Boston, before I found Mrs. Simpson. In their adversity, nobody knew them. I was forced to hunt up Mrs. Jones, and was at no little trouble to find her. After finding Mrs. Jones, she and I set out together, to Mrs. Simpson's. After the usual salutation, Mrs. Jones observed, "here is a gentleman who wishes to see you, Mrs. Simpson." My name she told her, was Burlington.--I had a message to her from her daughter. "My poor Clarissa! and how is she? and where is she?" asked the old lady eagerly. "At Philadelphia," said I, "with my sister, by this time, and in tolerable health." "Can you be Mary Burlington's brother?" "I am Madam." "Why haven't you heard," said Mrs. Jones, "that Miss Mary is married to one of the first gentlemen in the country ?" "How you talk," replied Mrs Simpson, taking off her glasses, and surveying the in astonishment. "You seem surprised, madam, don't you think my sister was good enough for any man?" "Yes," she said, "Mary was a good girl, but she got affronted and left our house." "And how is Miss Mary?" said Matilda, (as I took it) I should like to see her." "You can see her then; Mary would be equally pleased to see you, and if you can put yourself under my protection, l will see you safe there." "Oh, sir, she cannot--she was treated too ill here ever to forgive us." "She does forgive you, madam--you are mistaken in my sister." I then turned to Mrs. Jones, and asked "if she recollected Dupon?" and informed her what he was to me, and that he was married to Martha on the same day with my sister, and that his father was amongst the wealthiest men in the country. I wished to mortify this oId madam Simpson, whom I discovered was a mean wretch, but for the sake of her daughters I resolved to accomplish my scheme. I also apprized Mrs. Jones of Mrs. Cary's good fortune in the miraculous preservation of her son: and added a shining description of our thrice happy assembly that we all sat in one parlour. eat at one table, and our whole time filled up with the most agreeable amusements. "I am sure Miss Simpson, you must wish to see theim." Mrs. Jones expressed the most heart-felt satisfaction, and said "I always thought them girls would meet with good fortune at last, for they never had a spark of pride almut them ;and well does Mrs. Cary deserve her good fortune, for there never was a better woman, though she was persecuted in this town by a set of vipers, that ought never to prosper." Besides Matilda, there was present another daughter of Mrs. Simpson's, Eliza. I told them "I was serious, and that they must get ready, for I would not go without them ; and as you may not wish to go without your mother, we will take her too." "Oh, sir, you are very kind--but we cannot go--I am not fit to appear amongst such great people," said Matilda. "And why are you not fit?" "I am not able, sir; we have been very unfortunate since you saw us: we have been reduced almost to beggary. "That shall be an excuse," I answered, handing her my purse--"take that, and rig yourselves up.. get plenty of warm clothes, for I assure you, you will want them." "You can't be in earnest," said Mrs. Simpson. I told her--"I never was more in earnest in my life." The situation of this friendless family recalled to my mind my mother's last injunction; poverty marked the house throughout. Her son, the only one she had, was dead. Putting on air of gaiety, I told tire girls I should sup with them that evening, and have us something good for supper. Matilda get its some good wine, I am a great epicure, and let us have a better fire. I shall return after seeing Mrs. Jones home. Poor things! their wan looks and sunken cheeks, intimated too plain that good suppers and them had long been strangers. Mrs. Jones expressing a wish to go, I waited on her home. "I wonder, Mr. Burlington, how you can be so kind to them Simpsons, when they used your sister so ill? they had better have taken her life." "Ah, madam, but we must forgive each other. Does not the scripture tell us so? and only remember that they are poor." When we arrived at her house tea was ready, and I took an humble cup with the humble Mrs. Jones. While we were taking tea, a well dressed young man, with an epaulette upon his shoulder, entered the house, and asked if "he could get boarding there?" Mrs. Jones told him "he could not--she was not prepared to take boarders." He then asked "if she could lodge him that night?" "No; there were taverns and boarding-houses enough in the city--why do you not go to them?" The stranger smiled, and asked her "if she did not recollect him?" Upon which, Mrs. Jones looking earnestly at him, exclaimed "if it is not my William!" at which they flew into each others' arms. 29 It proved to be her son, who had just returned from a three years' cruise in the Mediteranean, and being much burnt with the sun was the reason she did not know him at first. I had intended to invite Mrs. Jones to go with me likewise, to see her friends: but the return of her gallant son, (her only child) had filled her heart to overflowing, and it could hold no more. When I returned to Mrs. Simpsons, the girls had just returned from shopping, which gave me hopes of my success—a glowing fire, good wine, and a good supper quite irradiated the countenance of Mrs. Simpson, while she repaid me in yankee style—“I guess you'll be too good,” and all that. “And had you no friend, Matilda, in your distress?” “No, indeed sir—yours is the first friendly voice we have heard.” While we were at supper, I proposed to Mrs. Simpson “to leave Boston and settle in Philadelphia: that she, I thought, would do better there, and I see no inducement to remain here; your son-in-law will, with his father probably settle there, and if you resolve to go, I will undertake to see you safe there, and see that you are comfortably situated afterwards; that I could not think of going away and leaving them unprotected and friendless. You may think upon it, however, and let me know. Meantime I desired the girls to get ready with all dispatch, for I should insist upon their accompanying me thither, whether they concluded to remove there or not.” After sapper we sat up late, drank wine, and chatted about Mary, and about Martha, and about every thing; and to tell the truth, I believe old mother Simpson and me took a little too much. Next day I called on a few of my old acquaintances, merely to see how the same people would behave under different circumstances—`Won't you stay and dine?'— `Can't you come and spend the evening?' I would as soon have dined with Beelzebub. Hunter, before we parted in New York, gave me a power of attorney to sell the property he owned in Boston, and bring him the money. I therefore called on Mr. S. his agent, to apprize him of my business. As I pursued my way to his house, not without some melancholy reflections on former times, my attention was arrested by the cruelty of a dray-man to his horse. He was beating the poor animal, and forcing him to proceed with a load too much for his strength. I stopped, and mildly reproved the man for his cruelty—he desisted for the purpose of attending to what I said: I was standing rather on one side of the horse, when the innocent creature turned his head to look at me, and seemed to implore my pity: the big tear was standing in his eye—it pierced me to the heart. The horse was familiar to me—I must know that horse, and should have known him amongst ten thousand—it was my father's old Pompey! He was sold at the sale, with the rest of his property, and must have been at least fourteen years old. “What will you take for him?” said I to his brother-brute. “Thirty dollars,” he answered. I pulled out the money and paid it—“Now, sir, take off the harness.” “O, I must take the load to the wharf, first.” “I would see you in perdition before he should pull it another inch—so take him out—he is my horse.” He took him out, while I stept to a shop for a bridle, and patting the poor old fellow, told him he should fare on the best, and never work more. I seturned to the tavern, and the first thing I did, was to see that Pompy had plenty to eat, and drink, and a tripple bed of straw. Poor old friend, I could have hugged him to my heart, nay I did do it. After disposing of Pompey, I called on Mrs. Simpson, (hearing would not be at home till evening) I found the girls very busy, preparing for their journey, and the old lady perfectly reconciled to remove to Philadelphia. I told them I should sail the ensuing day, and desired them without fail to be ready. Having completed Hunter's business, and the ladies their dresses, we on the day appointed, set sail for Philadelphia, taking old Pompey along. Poor old horse, I was afraid the vessel would jolt him too hard, but I made him a soft bed, and advised him to lie down. And now like a true knight errant, I appear, I dare say in the eyes of many. By different people, however, the thing will be viewed differently. Some will perhaps, have evil things in their heads; but let me tell them, they are evil people who think evil. I would pay as little attention to their opinion, as I would to the opinion of an ass.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXI. Nothing worthy of notice occured during our voyage. When we arrived at Philadelphia, I took the ladies to an inn, hard by the dwelling of my friends, with an assurance that I would visit them in the course of an hour. I next disposed of Pompey in a comfortable stable, and then waited on my friends, whom I found well. Clarissa rose and met me with a smile, (for she was there) and asked, “what news from Boston?” “All well,” I replied, “your mother and sisters were well when I left there.” “No letter?” said Clarissa. “No,” I replied, “they would have wrote, but they knew I could give more general satisfaction.” Not willing to make minute enquiries before so many, Clarissa said no more, particularly as I was engaged in replying to the several enquiries of my friends. In the course of the conversation, I failed not to acquaint Mary, of my good fortune in meeting with Pompey, and that he was now in Philadelphia. After chatting some time, and enquiring of Clarissa and Jinkins, how they got on, I proposed a walk, to the latter, saying my excuse to the company. As we proceeded to the Inn, where I left the ladies, I informed Jinkins of my plan agreeably to surprise, not only Clarissa, but the whole party. “What three more women?” said Jinkins. “Even so, and had like to have had one more.” “What in God's name are you going to do with a seraglio of women?” “Leave them with you dear Dick, for I am going away in the spring you know.” “D—d if you do then.—One is more than I want; 29* but I suppose I shall have to be noosed to one,” rather sheepishly. “for the sake of peace.” “I am pleased to hear that, for I suspect you mean Miss Watson.—I always wished that to take place,” said I. “And why do you all pitch upon me to marry her?” “Because I wish the poor orphan under protection, and happy.” “Why don't you take her under your protection? marry her yourself.” “But she loves you Dick, and I know, although you talk in this manner, you have a strong partiality for her; and be assured that if you do not marry her, I will, though I would not express as much to mortal, other than yourself. But understand me distinctly, when I make this declaration.—It is because I believe Miss Watson would make any man happy—and that she deserves to be so herself; but above all, because she is poor and destitute.” By this, we were at the house, where I left the ladies; and without loss of time, we set out with them to Mrs. Cary's. When we entered the parlour, I discovered marks of surprise in every countenance. “I told you that you should see your Mother, Clarissa,” said I, approaching her with the old ladies' arm locked in mine, “this is your mother.” It is needless to add the rest—when the transports of the mother, and the daughter, had given place, Matilda, and Eliza, were permited to approach and embrace their sister. Meanwhile, surprise and pleasure, were alike predominant in every beholder; not one of them had had the least shadow of suspicion, and never were more completely taken by surprise. I left to Mary the balance of the ceremony, and steped to the landlord, to have chambers prepared forth with, and return to the company, telling Mrs. Simpson. Suitable rooms were preparing for her, to which she might retire when she thought proper. In the course of an hour the Simpsons were shewn to their rooms, accompanied by Clarissa. “And now,” said Wilson, “you ought to close the drama, by having old Harry is it?” “Pompey you mean.' “Well Pompey be it, brought from the stable, and make me acquainted with him, for I confess I would rather see him, than the Simpsons.” “So would I.” “So would I.” Was uttered by every one; and I actually had to send for Pompey. My uncle had been apprised of the arrival of his brother's horse, and was no less anxious to see him. When it was announced that Pompey was at the door, every one flew to meet him, except the commodore, and as he could only move at a moderate walk, I waited for him. When we joined the party, the ladies were caressing the poor old fellow, talking to him and patting him with their hands. Mary must needs run for salt, and Pompey licked it out of her hand. I dare say, if he would have excepted it, the ladies would have sent a feather bed to his stall, so devoted were they to his ease and comfort. After their curiosity was gratified, I sent Pompey to his lodgings, and taking Jinkins with me, proceeded in quest of the Hunters. The old man, Jinkins informed me, had arrived in Ppiladelphia, and agreeably to the instructions he gave him, discovered the residence of his son, but farther he could not tell. On our way thither, Jinkins informed me, that the match was actually concluded upon, between him and Miss Watson—and that great efforts were making to bring about one between my uncle and his mother. Ferdinand, was the principal spokesman with the old man, though he threw in a word occasionally. I asked “if the commodore had ever made any personal overtures to his mother?” “No, her rapelling modestly, he believed, would never be brought to submit to a personal interview of that nature, I have myself, however, said little to her on the subject.” “But what does my uncle say?” “That,” said Jinkins, “I was just going to tell you.” “One night after my return, the ladies had retired to their chambers, your uncle, Ferdinand, and myself, were sitting by the fire, Ferdinand says, “come father, let us know your decision now, Dick is present, you would give no satisfaction till he arrived, now you can have his opinion.” “Oh thee's a worrysome dog—What do'st think Dick, they wants me to enter upon matrimony, and like o' that, with thee mother, and don't know whether she'll ha' me or not.” “Why don't you ask her?” said I. “Ask thee granny, think I'm goin' a courtin' to a woman that blushes when one looks at her? tell'ee what it'ill never do, for such old folks as we be, to be huggin' and bussin'.” “No necessity for hugging and bussing, (said I,) until after you are married.” “What will'ee have on't? how is one to woo? always seed 'um huggin' their sweet-hearts, but if so be that thy mother is willing to take such an old weather-beaten fellow as I be, an' I hear no more fash about it, why I'm never the man that'll flinch, d'ye see, to take command o' a steady vessel, and 'suppose it'll give comfort to the youngsters.” “Why, you are not so old, sir, you have just entered your fifty-first year, and my mother, she says, is in her fortieth—that is not so old, I'm sure, I havn't a doubt but you'll have several children.” “Ah, get along with thee, Dick—thought thee would not lend a hand—and thee's 'worst o' the crew.” He agreed, however, before we quitted him, that my mother “was most like his Eliza of any woman he had seen.” “All we want now,” said Jinkins, “is my mother's consent. I told her the other day that we had saved her the trouble of courting, having obtained the Commodore's consent, and that a little brother or sister would yield me the most joy of all things.” She burst into a laugh and almost broke my head, and bid me begone. I have learned since that she told the girls, who are always teazing her, that she would give them an answer when you returned, that you were her first and only friend, and if you advised her seriously to it, she would comply.” We now arrived at Smith's, as he is to be called, we found him and his father both sitting together, they appeared glad to see us, the young one particularly. I delivered the money to the father, twenty thousand dollars. He was pleased, beyond measure, at the sale, saying it was more than he had expected. After delivering the money, and a letter which his agent sent, I proposed his going with me, immediately, to purchase a house for his daughter-in-law, to which he assented cheerfully. But before we set out I asked the son if he and his wife had become reconciled. He answered that she waited for me, and would tell him nothing till I came. I told him I would see her that evening, and we proceeded. Upon looking over the papers at a reading room, we picked out one in Elm-street, and waited on the proprietor, who walked with us to the premises and concluded the contract. To save trouble and keep on safe ground I had the property conveyed to six trustees for her benefit during her life. It was a very handsome two-story brick building, two rooms below stairs, and four above, a cellar and kitchen, the whole was purchased for fourteen thousand dollars, possession given on signing and sealing. I put the key into my pocket, signifying to Hunter that the house must be furnished, and he or I must do it. He said he would do it, to be sure.—I replied I was glad to hear it, as I had to provide for Mrs. Simpson, and her two daughters, whom I found in distress in Boston, and had brought them on to this city at my own expense. Having said this, Jinkins and I returned. On our return Jinkins said “he would not be much surprised if young Hunter should rob his father, and clear out with the cash.” “The old fox will be too cunning for him.” Waving the subject of the Hunters, I observed to Dick “that so soon as we disposed of the Simpsons, we must bring my uncle to woo your mother in earnest; I wouldn't miss it hardly for the match. We must leave them alone someday, and some of us must lie in ambush.” At this we arrived at our lodgings—I knocked at the door of Mrs. Simpson, and told Clarissa her house was ready—gave her the key, saying it would be furnished the next day. Upon entering our parlour I sent for the landlord, and desired him to have some good music at seven o'clock, and a few other good things for supper; and turning to Wilson and Ferdinand, I informed them “that I had a matter though small, yet serious, to submit to them. Here are three poor females in distress, and must be assisted. I found them in want of the necessaries of life, clothed them, and brought them on at my own cost; now, as good christians, I wish to see what you will do, ladies and all—and remember, that they have neither house, nor home, nor friends: their brother, all the protector they had, is no more. You that are able, throw in accordingly.” Looking at Ferdinand, and calculating upon what his father would give him, he was worth more than the whole of us put together. “You cannot mean them d—n Simpsons?” said Wilson. “Yes, sir,” I replied warmly, “I mean them; where is your charity? you surely would not bear malice against females: here are two innocent girls, whom I dare say had no hand in the affair, you resent—and even if they had, I know you too well, Wilson, to believe you would harbour resentment against friendless orphans.” “There stop, you have said enough,” said Wilson, “you would have made an excellent preacher.” I then placed a table in the centre of the room, and setting a candle and a few cards thereon; after writing the sum I was willing to give and turning the card over to couceal the amount, I retired to my seat. The others followed my example, walking separately to the table, each one wrote on a card and turned it over. When all had got through, Wilson walked to the table and read as follows: Thomas Burlington, $500 Henry Wilson, 300 Martha Cary, 30 Ferdinand Burlington, 900 Richard Jinkins, 250 Mary Wilson, 50 Martha Burlington, 100 Charles Burlington, 300 Betsey Watson, 20 $2,450 “Well,” said my uncle, “'think we all did pretty well, han't we?” “Yes sir, but it was nothing more than was to be expected after a sermon.” said Jinkins. Just at that moment the musicians arrived. I desired Mary “to go and bring Matilda and Eliza, and she might use her pleasure as to the other two.” She, however, returned with them all, which completely filled our parlour. I now saw, what I ought to have done sooner, viz. that we must adjourn to a larger room, and issued orders to that amount. I was, however, no little amused at the perplexity of the Commodore, when he saw so many persons enter the parlour, which were to him unexpected; and although the room was small, his heart was big—he cast his eyes round, up and down the room, then on the company, and hitching his chair closer to the wall, seemed by his looks to say `here is room.' The company was now filing off under the guidance of Ferdinand. I remained behind with my uncle, intending to bring up the rear. After they had sufficient time to be regulated, I drew my uncle's arm under mine, and followed. Leading him near the fire I left him, and took up my flute—Ferdinand performed on the clarionette— Jinkins and Wilson sung. The ladies appeared (and probably were) highly delighted, while my uncle seemed to forget his age. An hour and a half had flown (while it appeared not more than half that time) when refreshment was introduced. The collation was delicious, ample, and in endless variety—syllibubs foamed high, jellies trembled, champaign and claret formed rivers, coffee and tea an ocean, whilst cheese, ham, cake of all sorts, and fruit of every kind completed the repast. The whole was seasoned with glee, and merry jests, nor must it be forgotten that Jack Jinkins made one of our guests; the man, whose gallant conduct had endeared him to us all. He was neatly dressed, and demeaned himself with that ease of manner, which bespoke a just sense of the tribute he deserved. When our repast was over, Mary declared “she would have a dance—it was too much to let all those good things go off so.—Choose partners, ladies and gentlemen.” Betsey Watson ran to my uncle and pulled him out. “Oh, child, I knows nothing at all about thae sort o' dances.” “No excuse,” said she, “you can just walk the figure —we only want you to make out the set.” The old man suffered her to pull him on to the floor— “—He'd seen the time he could foot it with the best of 'um.” The music began, and so did we—I mean to go wrong. Could not make the figure for our souls, and I was seriously engaged in restoring order, before I discovered that Wilson was putting the others out, to raise a laugh. My uncle, though he lifted his feet now and then, could by no means get into the way on't. In short, all fell into confusion, every one was seized with laughter. “Let us begin again,” said I. “No, no:” answered Wilson, “we'll get right directly—cross hands here madam—” “Now we ha' it,” said my uncle, “right and left.” I had to leave them, being unable to keep the floor from laughing. “Well, now, I've made thee all laugh, I'll go sit down—'twas just what thee's wanted.” We commenced again, and went through one or two rules. The music was now dismissed, and plays succeeded, nor did we break up until the clock struck twelve. I then conducted the Simpsons to their rooms, and we separated for the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">30 CHAPTER XXXII. Next morning Wilson showed me a letter from his parents, pressing his return, and we fixed on the first of March for our journey to Tennessee. This was the middle of February. After breakfast I took the key from Clarissa, and went to superintend the furnishing her house, having previously informed Mrs. Simpson that her friends had made up a little sum for her, and if she could suit herself in the purchase of a comfortable house, (not exceeding the amount) she sould have the money any time, stating the amount. It was late in the day before the house was ready to receive the Simpsons, and leaving the Hunters there, I waited on Clarissa with a carriage, to convey her thither. Her mother and sisters rode with her in the carriage, while Jinkins and I attended them on foot. Here something which I cannot describe took place between the Hunters and Simpsons—it was neither joy nor sorrow, nor love, nor hatred, confidence, or suspicion, but it was a mixture of all these. I introduced Hunter to Mrs. Simpson and her daughters, telling him, at the same time, “I presumed they were old acquaintances.” He muttered something, and saluted very coolly. “And you, sir, I suspect, need no introduction,” addressing the son,—he bowed; we bid them good by, and left them to come to an explanation in any way they might think proper. “They are well matched,” said Jinkins, “I don't like that old Mrs. Simpon, she has too much pepper and vinegar in her looks for me.” Jinkins was not far wrong, although she had been brought low, yet there was still to be seen the remains of pride and haughtiness in her countenance. But her daughters were modest, good-natured, and handsome. On our way home, Jinkins informed me that he and Betsey were actually engaged, though it was a profound secret to the whole world. Ferdinand and Wilson, he said, had resorted to various stratagems to detect him, but without success. I approved of his independence, and observed, “It would be well to have both marriages take place at the same time, that is if your mother consents, and I shall certainly advise her to do so; not that I think matrimony necessary to her happiness.—As a friend, in any other case, I would advise her against it. But joined, as the family is, by the ties of blood and friendship, I think it a very advisable and a very desirable union. In the course of the day, I had a private interview with Mrs. Cary, the particulars of which is a sacred trust, which I am not at liberty to divulge. The amount however was, that the much wished for union between her and my uncle, was to take place the following evening, and that as the old gentleman and her, had never conversed on the subject, she consented to receive him in her chamber the present evening. “These matters being settled, I imparted my success to my uncle, telling him, “we would keep it secret from the boys, as they will only be teasing you.” “Thee did right, for thee's a saucy set make the best o' 'um. He said “he was afeard o' none o' 'um, but Dick, he was the worst o' 'um all—I wish 'twar over.” “Do not be uneasy sir, about Dick, he will find enough to do; he is to be spliced himself, as you call it, on the same evening” “D—I he is, what to Betsey? “Well! never thought such a thing o' Dick! if he bean't the cunnin'est dog, never seed 'um look at her, hardly. The first opportunity I had, I informed Jinkins of my success, and that the marriage was to take place the ensuing evening, and as I suspect you have no objection, it is as well to have them both at the same time, particularly as I would soon leave the country. I recommended to him at the same time, to keep the matter still a secret, and that I had promised my uncle to be silent. Jinkins approved of the plan, and thanked me for my advice. I was well pleased, being afraid that he would object, I mean to his (so sudden) nuptials. He had always appeared wary, and had we not proceeded with the greatest delicacy, we had never brought the matter to perfection. I walked into Martha's chamber, and sending for Mary, I told her, “that as she was fertile in inventions, she and Martha must contrive between them, some means by which they could detect the particulars of an interview, which I informed them, was to take place between the commodore, and Mrs. Cary, that afternoon. They were highly pleased at the proposal, and after a pause Mary proposed going instantly to Mrs. Cary's chamber, and hold her in conversation, whilst Martha should cautiously raise the sash, which communicated between her own chamber and that of Mrs. Cary's, this she said could easily be done, as a curtain which hung before it in the chamber of the latter would prevent discovery. I now returned to the parlour, where I found my uncle. Ferdinand, and Wilson, were reading the newspapers, and making a sign to the old man; he arose, and followed me to Mrs. Cary's chamber. “My uncle, madam, wishes to pay his respects to you.” She blushed, and asked him to be seated. I left them together. I had not been so cautious in this intrigue, as not to be perceived by Wilson, who was communicating it to Ferdinand. As I joined them, who should interrupt us but old Mrs. Simpson. So old lady (I thought) you are for the money, I can see it in your looks. She enquired for the ladies. I told her “they were particularly engaged. I would have rather seen the old —. I had like to have called her an ugly name; but I was determined she should not interrupt them. Meantime, Wilson, and Ferdinand, (suspecting she had some private business) through their extreme politeness, must withdraw; and where should they go, but (like Mrs. Simpson) to the very place where they were least wanted, to the respective chambers of their wives. And curse your old soul, (I thought) now I shall be broke up. Wilson soon returned in great confusion, for intruding upon Betsey and Jinkins. Ferdinand, likewise returned with a smile, that indicated very plain, what was going on. “I would speak with you,” said Mrs. Simpson to me. I led her into the dining-room, where she informed me, “she had purchased a small house, in the edge of the town, for fifteen hundred dollars, and if I would be so kind as to let her have the money?” “Certainly madam, and I will walk with you and see that the sale is properly executed.” Getting my hat, I set out with old mother Simpson. Upon viewing the house, I found it not a bad bargain, and proceeding with her to the proprietor, concluded the sale, and gave her the balance of her money. Thus having rid myself of Mrs. Simpson, I returned to my friends. I found all the gentlemen belonging to our party, nor shall I repeat the drollery with which the old man warded off the attack of the whole squadron, as he termed it; but proceeded to hunt Martha and Mary. Jinkins suspecting my business, came toward me, and without speaking, led me to his bride's chamber; saying, as we walked thither, that he had just attended the ladies there. I said, “we will go and hear the fun, if they will admit us. Accordingly we knocked at the door, and and asked leave to come in. Mary observed, “You came to hear the news; but you will be greatly disappointed.” “How so, did they not converse then?” I asked. “Very little.” “Let us hear it.” She complied as follows: “Pretty snug birth.” And after a pause.—“Well madam, Mrs. Cary, I ha' come to see.—Thae youngsters will ha' it so, 'at we are to be spliced, an I han't been attacked by the whole squadron nation a bit, peace can get for 'um de ye see, and if so be, as thee and I ha' seen boisterous times on't, and it 'ill give a comfort to thae young folks, we'll be' to get married any how. Charles was sayin' that thee had some mind to it, and suppose we'll be to please 'um, and be done we' it. He ceased speaking some time, when Mrs. Cary replied, 30* “I am proud of the honour you intend me, captain Burlington, and as you say, the young people have been soliciting me very earnestly to the match.—I had intended to live and die a widow; but since it has turned out as it has, that our children are so mingled together, and seems to be their desire to please them, it appears we will have to comply with their wishes. “That's just what 'was thinkin' on myself d'ye see; but tell'ee what thee'll ha' the worst o' the bargain. And to tell'ee the truth, I was pretty much o' thy way o' thinkin', never to marry, and ha' been a long time a widower. But 'twill be a blubberin' on't we' thae youngsters if don't.—They tells as how Jinkins be goin' to yoke in we Betsey too, and she'll feather her nest when she gets 'um.—Yes, yes, if 'don't do a part by Dick, let whose will go to leeward, never stir if 'don't like Dick almost as well as Ferdinand, I called 'um Thomas, but 'has a likin' for the man 'at, raised him, and said would keep the name for 'is sake. But as I was sayin' Dick 'ill fare as well as the best o' 'um; but suppose I be to go back now, and tell thae youngsters it be all settled, and we'll ha' no more about it. Wont'ee come to tea, I didn't see thee at dinner, thee bean't sick art thee?” “I am not sir,” said Mrs. Cary. “I shall be at supper captain.” “Well I'll go and see what thae young ones be about,” said my uncle, and left her without ceremony. As soon as he returned, Martha and I ran in upon Mrs. Cary, and told her we heard the whole courtship. She bid us begone—we were saucey girls, and that she would turn over a new leaf with us, when she got an old man of her own.—So now you have all, and clear out you and Jinkins both, we don't want you here. On the appointed evening, my uncle and Mrs. Cary, Mr. Jinkins and Miss Watson were severally united. I gave away Betsey, and Sullivan, the admired friend of Mrs. Cary, performed this last office to her widowhood. Nothing else distinguished this thrice happy event, but a plain supper, no dancing, no music—only the two Miss Simpsons and Sullivan were present—Mrs. Sullivan we would have been proud to have had, but she was confined, having but a few days previous given birth to a son, which in honour of my uncle, was named Thomas. Nothing worth the reader's attention occurred during the remainder of the time we spent in Philadelphia. Mrs. Simpson was happily situated, in her own little dwelling, she and her daughters pursuing the millinary business—Clarissa and her husband lived together and appeared happy—the old man living with them and pursued the mercantile business, for which he possessed no ordinary talents. At length the parting day arrived—the scene was, as might be expected. Our carriage was at the door—we were all equipped for stepping into it, when my uncle, the tears running down his cheeks, walked silently to Mary, and laid a heavy purse of gold in her lap: he tried to speak, but was not able—Mary attempted to thank him, but found it impossible to utter a word—Wilson said “dear uncle, you are too gen—”: generous he meant to say, but overcome by his feelings, he was unable to finish the sentence. The rest—but our language is too poor to do justice to scenes like this, and I pass it over. I confess that my attachment for those worthy individuals with whom I was compelled to part, was so great and so equally divided, that my regret was only equalled by it. This was the first day of March, eighteen hundred and eleven, when Wilson, his wife, and myself set out for Tennessee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXIII. My uncle being attacked with a disease, supposed to be produced by the climate of the West Indies, had been advised to try that of the United States. But he found the change too much on the opposite extreme—I therefore, the evening that preceded our departure, advised him to try that of New-Orleans. To this he gave me no positive answer, saying that he had a wife and children now, and supposed “he be to be guided by them; but thee'll write to us now and then, and I'll let thee know.” Nothing worthy of remark happened on our journey to Tennessee, where we arrived in fourteen days, at the dwelling of old Captain Wilson, whom and his wife we found well. Great joy distinguished this happy meeting, but like the sorrow of parting with our friends, it defied description. After spending a day with Captain Wilson, I rode to Nashville for the purpose of engaging a boat to transport Wilson's goods and mine to Tennessee—and fortunately met with a gentleman just setting out for New-Orleans, who wished to engage a back freight. Having furnished him with the necessary instructions, I was about to mount my horse, when, whom should I meet but Captain T.! It may be supposed this event was mutually pleasing—giving my horse therefore to the landlord, we adjourned to a room, and over a bottle of wine related to each other the principal incidents which happened to each since our separation. In answer to my enquiries about his last escape from the Spaniards, he replied, “That he took it by land to Vera Cruz—that he never stopped till the next night, when fearing his horse might give out, and considering himself out of danger, having as he supposed travelled about one hundred miles, he stopped and rested that night at a small hamlet, and reached Vera Cruz next morning in safety.—I can't think how you and Wilson came to suffer yourselves to be taken? why, if you had fired on them they would have flown at the flash of the gun.” “In fact,” I told him, “I and Wilson had laid down and were asleep, when they surrounded and had us prisoners before we were wide awake.” He resumed—“he had no fear whatever when he gained the open plain.” He then expressed the most cordial satisfaction at my good fortune. “You may place that to my account,” said he, “if it had not been for my wild-goose chase, you would not have met with Hunter.' I told him what was true, “that my sufferings greatly over-balanced all, and ten times as much as I gained by Hunter; and yet still it seems like Providence.” When we finished our bottle, he procured a horse and rode home with me to Captain Wilson's, saying “he must see Henry.” After the expressions of meeting between him and Wilson were over, I made him acquainted with my sister, telling Mary that “that was Captain T. of whom she had heard so much.” “Yes, madam, I am the Capt. T. who was the cause of much distress to you.” Captain Wilson was now in the heighth of his glory; somebody to laugh, and drink with him, and listen to his long stories. He was just in the middle of a campaign when Capt. T. and I arrived, when luckily for Mary, (whom he was entertaining) we relieved her; but he will, no doubt, indemnify her at some future day. As Wilson was now to begin the world, it was proposed by his parents that he should reside with them. But this I objected to, and advised him to build a house for himself, as the old man intended to leave him the plantation on which he lived at his decease, he could build on a part of it; two families in one house I told him would never agree, no matter how near and dear they might be. A store-house must likewise be erected, and that very soon, ready for business, by the time the goods arrived, this would keep us pretty busy. Henry was the old lady's darling, she disliked this arrangement much—but the old man said “it was by far the best plan—Henry could have the big field, and raise him as much corn as would supply him, and build him a house on one corner of it, and he could go and see his daughter-in-law once a day, and rock the cradle for her occasionally”—all this was well. The great road leading from Nashville to New-Orleans, passed through the Captain's plantation, the neighbourhood was populous, and here we concluded to build a store-house. These things being settled, that same evening, after supper, I drew out my pocket-book, telling Wilson “that it was full time to give him the balance of Mary's portion—ten thousand dollars you have already received, or will receive, when your goods arrive, and here is forty, which makes fifty thousand dollars in the whole. Will that do?” said I. “Yes, it will more than do,” said the generous Wilson. “You are robbing yourself, Charles,” said Mary— “my brother we cannot take so much from you.” But I silenced them saying, “that in justice they ought to have had more, and perhaps (if you make good use of this) I may add more hereafter.” A great deal was said on this occasion, and not the least by old Mr. Wilson and his wife, which it is needless to repeat. The old lady, after expressing much seeming satisfaction, got up and went to her chamber, and in a few minutes returned, and laid the bag of guineas which her son had given her in Mary's lap, saying as she did so, that “they had given Henry nothing yet, but I have done my part: now, old man, do you do yours.” “Well, you're very cunning,” said her husband, “to make a merit of giving Henry what is his own.” “Dear madam,” said Mary, “it would be a sin to give us more: I cannot take all this, indeed—here, you must oblige me by sharing it with me at least.” “Keep it, child,” said the old lady, “what use have I for it? Mary, however, forced a few guineas upon her. The next morning Wilson and I set about business in earnest—Some twelve or fourteen workmen, including carpenters, were set to work—nothing but the sound of teams, axes, saws and hammers were to be heard, and in the course of a few weeks, a store and dwelling-house was completed, and at the end of six weeks our goods arrived from New-Orleans, all safe and in good order. Here then was employment for us all—Wilson and I making sales, while Mary was busied in furnishing her house. She would forsooth come into the store, and pick the best of every thing, accompanied by her mother-in-law, who was all admiration at the fine things. The old gentleman regularly spent every day at the store, where he found ample opportunity of indulging his inclination for company and conversation. At the end of two months from the time of our arrival in Tennssee, we had the unspeakable pleasure of saluting one of our friends whom we left in Philadelphia—and you won't guess who it was. It was not my uncle—it was not Ferdinand, nor Jinkins, nor Jack Jinkins, nor Sambo, nor Ling. Who then could it be? Neither more nor less than old Pompey! I had enjoined it upon my friends, to send him by the first waggons that came to our part of the country; the waggoner tied him to the hinder part of the waggon, and he travelled at his leisure—a handsome reward was bestowed on the waggoner for his pains. We had in the meantime, however, received letters from our friends, who still remained in Philadelphia. They were all well, and had determined to remain in Philadelphia till fall, when it was unanimously concluded to remove to New-Orleans, and establish a mercantile house of trade, to communicate both with New-York and Liverpool. The letter which brought us the news that our friends had come to a resolution to settle in New-Orleans, likewise informed us that the whole party would make the journey by land as far as Tennessee, and take water at Nashville, and that we might expect to see them, if no accident occurred, some time in October. This letter was dated July 7th—It is not easy to say whether the old Captain's family or that of his son's (of whom I was one) was most pleased at hearing this news. I pass over the intervening time between this and the safe arrival of our friends in Tennessee, it being distinguished by nothing of consequence, with the exception of the hurry and bustle of the senior and junior Mrs. Wilsons in making preparation for the guests. At length on the twentieth of October, having heard that the party were at McMinville, I took horse to meet them, accompanied by Wilson. About twenty-two miles from our residence behold we espied two carriages moving towards us very slow, and two gentlemen on horseback, whom we soon recognized to be Ferdinand and Jinkins. Long before we got within shaking hands, every head that could get out of the carriage, was out, and amongst the rest the knotty pate of Sambo. He was in the foremost carriage, which besides him, contained my uncle and aunt. The other carriage was occupied by Martha, Mrs. Jinkins, and Jack. All was exclamation, joy, and universal tumult, not a word of which could be distinguished for several minutes. At length, as I rode by the side of my uncle's carriage, the old man addressed me with— “How far may it be now to the lands end, o' a place —thee didn't mind to stop this side o' it—sure, if I havn't travelled a thousand leagues over mountains and hills, and plagued wi' a sort o' boats they called 'um, in crossing thae rivers. “Oh, I'd a been across the Atlantic wi' not half the din, but 'suppose 'can't be far now.” “No sir, we will get there to-night, if you push on a little faster; but you must put on more sail, sir, the road is good now.” “Thof I ha' nothing to do with sails or rigging, albeit thee may tell the fellow at the helm what thee likes, (meaning the driver,) tell'ee what, it be the first and last voyage I takes by land, and I han't been jolted wi' the tossin' o' the vessel, or what 'ere it be called, over hill and dale, it be a wonder, sometimes on her starboard and sometimes on her larboard, wi' runnin' down steep places, and puttin' about ship, I ha' been sick on't, d'ye see.” None of the party complained but my zncle, all seemed in high spirits. About dusk we arrived at the plantation of Captain Wilson, and as his was the largest and most convenient house to entertain our travellers, we took Mary up as we passed by, and proceeded to the Captain's. Here they were met by the Captain himself, who after a kind and welcome greeting, invited them to walk into the house, where they were severally presented to Mrs. Wilson and the Captain. Nothing could exceed the joy, no words could describe the raptures of Mary, Martha, and Betsey, and my aunt—they seemed as though they would devour each other embracing and caressing. The ladies, however, retired to another room, leaving the gentlemen at liberty to enjoy themselves without restraint. I had much curiosity to observe how my uncle and Captain Wilson would marshal the affair, of manifesting to each other that exalted opinion, and good liking, which existed between them long ere they met. After my uncle, therefore, had done with be-theeing every mountain, hill, river, and tavern, which thwarted him on his way to Tennessee, the Captain got leave to put in a word, and was soon engaged in one of his long stories, when supper was announced. Captain Wilson and the Commodore, resembled each other as near as possible, in their dispositions and principles—they were alike generous and warm-heated, each was diffident, and appeared perfectly (as most good men are) insensible of his own merit. The Captain had been a great soldier, and the other a great sailor; nor was the Commodore guilty of telling such tedious stories as the Captain—such as they were, however:—they were infinitely pleased with each other, although it was evident that by far the greatest number of my uncle's sea-phrases, were unintelligible to his friend. After spending a month in Tennessee, we were doomed once more to part, our friends pursuing their journey to New-Orleans, and Wilson and I pursuing our mercantile business in Tennesse, after promising to visit them in the course of the next year. C1 This pleasure was prevented, however, by the breaking out of the Creekwar, and every man who had any respect for the character of a soldier, and there were few that had not, in our state, repaired to the field, under the gallant General Jackson. Wilson and I, with our commander, Captain T—, were among the first volunteers that marched, much against the will of the ladies, but with the warmest approbation of the old Captain. We continued in the army until after the victory of New-Orleans, one or other of us visiting Tennessee occasionally to see the family, having left Mary at Captain Wilson's, who in the course of time gave birth to a daughter, and that too while Wilson and I were both absent. As every incident of notice, both of the Creek war, and the different battles of New-Orleans, are now before the public, I shall pass over them in silence, and confine myself to those which more immediately concern myself. When we were ordered to New-Orleans, for the purpose of defending that city, it may be supposed we lost no time in paying our respects to our friends, whom we found in great consternation at the approach of the enemy, particularly the ladies, as they had understood that the city was to be given up to be plundered by the British soldiers. As we marched down the street our ears were assailed by loud shrieking, and bitter lamentations—the women running to and fro, wringing their hands, and bewailing their situations in shricks and cries. General Jackson enquired into the cause of their distress, and being told it was occasioned by their fears of the British, he desired those who informed him, to assure the ladies that the British should never enter New-Orleans. No sooner was this made known, than they rent the air with “Vive la Jackson!” and waving their handkerchiefs, greeted him as their deliverer. It will be recollected that a day of public thanksgiving was appointed to celebrate the victory; and through crowds of joyful citizens we followed our General to the Cathedral Church, which was splendidly adorned for the occasion. Whilst every eye was bent upon the heroic General, and every ear listening to the prayers that were offered up for his happiness, some one pulled me gently by the sleeve—I turned round, and who should I see but my old friend, Dennis, of Mexico, who in the same instant pointed to Leanora! My brain grew giddy, and my heart fainted within me. To what a pinnacle of happiness had I now attained! participating in the glory of a victory which was to render our name immortal, and at the same time in the presence of all I held dear on earth—I was intoxicated with delight. Leanora was standing, the better to observe the ceremony, and though I could not catch a glance of her eye, I kept mine fixed upon her; nor did I withdraw them, until the service was ended; when, throwing myself in the way she must pass, I caught her by the hand, but was unable to command a word. She was likewise silest—nor did she faint or shriek, or give way to any of the weakness' of her sex. We walked some distance, before I was able to say, “This pleasure, madam, repays me for all I have suffered in your country.” I asked permission to attend her home; and enquired to what miracle I owed this happiness? She only replied by a shower of tears, and we walked on in silence.— When we arrived at her dwelling, she invited me to walk in, and we had scarcely seated ourselves, when Dennis entered the parlour. “May the powers bless us,” said he, offering his hand, “but we are here, bag and baggage; and didn't I know you the first glimpse I had of your face? You know I did, and glad enough I was, I hope your honour is well?” “Dear Dennis I am well, and would rather see you and your lady than to be monarch of the world; but I will talk with you some other time—yes, a whole year, Dennis,” and he took himself off. Leanora gave me to understand, briefly, “That her father was accused, by Government, of conniving at my escape, and had to fly for his life, to this city.” I told her I would hear her story some other time, when we were both more composed. Her father now made his appearance, accompanied by father Antonio. He saluted stiffly, as most Spaniards do, without seeming to recollect me. Offering my hand, I informed him who I was. He seemed little pleased at the renewal of our acquaintance; asked, coolly, after my health, and with a haughty air withdrew into another room, whither Antonio followed him. Poor old man! his dress, as well as that of Leanora, too plainly bespoke his situation, and his head was almost white, and the wo-worn furrows had taken possession of his cheek. “The difficulties you have suffered on my account,” thought I, “may well have prejudiced you against me;” but for his daughter's sake I wished it had happened otherwise, as I saw she was hurt. “I will go and bring Wilson to see you, Leanora; he is in town.” Having said this I left her. When I arrived at Ferdinand's, the company was thunder-struck at my discovery, and my uncle, pulling a chair beside him, bid me sit dawn and tell him all about it. I excused myself, of course, borrowed a small sum from Ferdinand, and taking Wilson's arm returned to Leanora's. We found her and her father sitting in the same parlour where I left her, engaged in conversation. Leanora expressed much pleasure at seeing Wilson, and her father greeted him with much more cordiality than he did me. Without loss of time I told the old man I wished to speak with him privately. He arose and walked into the room I had seen him withdraw to upon his entrance into the house. I followed him in, and laying the money on a table that stood near me, addressed him as follows: “Accept this trifle, sir, as a small remuneration for the loss you have sustained on my account. It is with much sorrow I learn that you were plunged into great distress on my departure from Mexico. I have an ample fortune, and you will confer an eternal obligation on me by sharing it with me.” But this haughty Spaniard touched it not, nor did he deign to thank me; and turning his back upon me with ineffable contempt, took the precedence in walking out of the room. This was a bad omen; however, I was by no means discouraged, and followed him out, leaving the cash on the table, and father Antonio to watch it. I took a seat by Leanora, and entered into conversation with her, on matters of a different nature, whilst Wilson was entertaining the old gentleman, God knows (for I don't) about what. In a few minutes Wilson succeeded in persuading the Don (may heaven reward him for the deed) to walk with him and see his friends, and they left us without speaking a word. I was now alone with Leanora; my time was short, and the only equivalent was to use it to the best advantage. Waving every other consideration, therefore, I adverted to that nearest my heart. Briefly, Leanora agreed to be mine, in spite of frowns or fortune. The conduct of her father to me she said was nothing but the effect of spleen, and mortification, which arose from his inability to leave her independent; and undertook to obtain his consent to our union, of which she seemed to have little doubt, when he came to be acquainted with the advantages of the alliance. After things were settled upon this footing, I desired Leanora to call Dennis. When he came, I sent him into the room for the money. Dennis, in the meantime, had prepared a repast, of which Leanora and I partook; nor have we often since that day enjoyed the comforts of the social board without being blessed with the company of each other. In the course of two hours Leanora's father returned; but not quite in so sullen a mood. The reception he met with, at the house of my friends, had evidently lowered his Spanish pride. He condescended to smile, as he entered the parlour, and said to his daughter, “de lady beg you to honour them.” “Yes,” I rejoined, “they will be proud of your acquaintance,” and taking my hat I took leave of them, saying to Leanora, “I would bring the ladies to see her in the course of half an hour, and I hoped to have the pleasure of her and her father's company that evening at the house of my friends.” Before I proceed further, it is necessary to give a brief account of my friends in New-Orleans, where, as already 31* remarked, they resided. Ferdinand and his father lived in the same house; Jinkins and his foster-father lived in a separate one, not far distant from thence: but on this evening they were all assembled at Ferdinand's. Mary, taking the advantage of General Carrol's escort to New-Orleans, to visit her friends, as well as her husband, had, with her young daughter, lately arrived. Nor must I omit to mention that both Ferdinand and Jinkins had been blessed each of them with a son, but this is nothing compared to what I am now obliged to add. Reader, raise your expectations to the highest pitch: you are about to be astonished, as I certainly was myself. My uncle had the unspeakable pleasure of being blessed with a son, three months before the birth of his grand-sons! Wilson and myself had been so much engaged since our arrival in the city, that our friends had but little of our company, and being now at leisure, it was agreed and intended to celebrate the birth of their children by “a great merry-making,” as my uncle called it, and the banquet was to take place the next day; when the mighty scheme was entirely forgot in the joyful discovery of Leanora. It would be mockery, as well as loss of time, to repeat the expressions of joy on this occasion. The ladies chided me severely for keeping them so long from the sight of Leanora. Mary and Martha were sitting, with their bonnets in their hands, and could hardly be restrained by Wilson from setting off to see her, without more ceremony. Meanwhile, a sumptuous supper was ordered, and the tedious half hour had expired, when Martha, Mary, Betsey, and my aunt, attended by all the gentlemen, except my uncle, sallied forth to the house of my intended father-in-law, for hitherto I had never heard his name; I apprized them on the way, that they would be much disappointed upon seeing the object of their curiosity; that they must not expect to see a beauty. Leanora was well formed, had a very expressive countenance, good features, a brilliant black eye, and brown complexion, but the roses had left her cheek; in fact, she was much altered from what she was: the effect of distress, no doubt, and that too on my account. But it was her magnanimous soul, and her generous heart, that principally captivated me. Poor Leanora had like to have been pressed to death, by the eager embraces of her new acquaintances, whilst her father viewed the scene in silent astonishment. Without paying the least attention to him, they were flying off with Leanora, when I hinted the oversight to Mary. She flew back in an insant, and taking hold of his arm, led him along, whilst I wiped the tear of sensibility, from the wan cheek of Leanora. Seeing Dennis look mournfully after us, I asked Leanora to let him come too; and the delighted Dennis, accompanied us, and was permitted to be seated amongst us, at the general rendezvous. Meanwhile, Mary never let go the old Don's arm, until she landed him safe in the house. And now I am once more nonplused in my narrative, being unable to do justice to the happiness which distinguished this evening's entertainment. I must, however, relate a few of the incidents which distinguished the flight of Don Emanuel, which I learn is the name of Leanora's father, and formed a part of the evening's amusement. The keeper when he found the door of the prison open, and the prisoner gone, hastened to the Vice-Roy, and charged Don Emanuel, with effecting the prisoner's escape; making oath to the allegation, and orders were immediately issued for his apprehension. It had been previously rumored, that he connived at the escape of capt. T—, and that he had often of late transcended his instructions in several instances. “Meantime, a friend who was present when the order was issued, fled to the Don, and apprized him of his danger, and hastily addressing me, said, “Leanora, (for it was her that related the circumstances) secure all the money in the house, as quick as possible, my daughter, Unco will —. He then, pale as a corpse, disappeared. Although I trembled at such a degree, that I could scarcely stand, with the assistance of Dennis, and father Autonio, I had just secured one small box of money, when the house was filled with offices in quest of my father. After making strict search for him, in every part of the house, a part of their number returned to report their ill success, whilst the others remained in possession of the house. In a short time, an officer came and took possession of every thing in the house, as forfeited to government, concluding that my father had absconded, which was proof of his guilt. I was permitted to stay in the house, but sat up the whole night. Toward day, Dennis went to the garden, and took what money he had secreted there, and carried it to the dwelling of Unco; there he saw my father, and disclosed to him the whole matter. My father had intended to proceed on to Vera-Cruz, that night, had Unco heen at home; but you know where he was, said she with a smile to me. “Briefly my father told Dennis, “that he would try to escape to New-Orleans, as he would not be safe in any other country, and that he and father Antonio must accompany me thither afterwards, as he could better effect his escape alone. I believe he continued there, concealed by Unco's wife, forty days, before he set off accompanied by Unco to Vera-Cruz, and then he lay concealed at the house of Unco's uncle, three weeks, before he could obtain a passage to New-Orleans; and I just arrived at Vera-Cruz the next day, after he set sail. I took a passage for Havana, and from there to New-Orleans, where with my faithful friends, Antonio and Dennis, only to attend me—I arrived safe. “And every word of that is the trut,” said Dennis, “but my lady did'nt tell you after all, how I fixed 'um. “No Dennis,” said I, “you must tell us that yourself, I love to hear the sound of your voice once more.” “Well, I'll tell you how it was; the cursed divils, God forgive me, they wasn't satisfied with getting all my master had in the world, and his money into the bargain, but they says to me `Old man, your master had more more money than here is; don't you know where he kapes his money?' God knows my master, poor sowl, never hoarded up money in his born days—I don't know any thing about my master's money;' and so it passed on— every time they'd see me, they would be sure to ax me to tell them where my master hid his money? and at last, thinks I, I'll match you, and so just the very day before my lady and I was to start off, that night what does I do but tells them that (making out as if it was a great secret) that if they would just give me fifty guineas, I would tell them; but they must never betray me, and they must put the money down first, and that I would agree to give it back if in case they didn't find what I told them wasn't the truth—and so they gives me the money, and I tells them right in the sout corner of my master's garden, if they would dig there, if they didn't find it, I'd agree to be buried there myself. The sorrow a bit they know'd we were were coming away, and I'll warrant my poor master's garden paid for the roast; and I got that much out of them, clear gain.” Dennis continued to entertain us during the balance of the evening, to the great amusement of the company.— Meantime my father Don seemed to relax by degrees; but I paid little attention to any thing but one object: once in the while I would observe how he relished my attention to his daughter. So far as I could perceive he showed no sign of disapprobation. We sat up late, and Don Emanuel arose to take leave, saying to his daughter, “it was time to go,” when the ladies, all with one accord, declared they could not part with her. “Indeed, sir,” said Martha, “she cannot go, and you, sir, must stay, likewise.” But there was father Antonio, some one would be obliged to go—when Dennis said, “Devil a fear of him— sure won't I be there.” Finally it was settled that Jack Jinkins and Dennis should go: and Mary, seating herself by the side of the Don, and taking hold of his hand, said “He must reconcile himself to stay;” to which he assented. I must gratify the reader with a partial disclosure, (but it wil be partial, of a few matters which occurred between myself and Leanora that evening, while the company was otherwise engaged. I proposed to her to fix upon some day, and not a very distant one, for our union. She said a week, I wished it the next day, and so we split the difference—and the third day from that was finally agreed upon. She had previously given me to understand that she had been questioned by her father respecting my views, that she had briefly imparted to him what he might expect. On the evening appointed, Leanora and I were united, to the great joy of our friends, and still greater of ourselves. Thus having brought the narrative of the principal incidents of my life (so far) to a happy conclusion, I have but little more to add. And here I must remark, what never fell within my knowledge until after my marriage, and that is, that the individual least noticed in the narrative, is perhaps the most interesting and efficient character connected with it, I mean father Antonio. To his instructions Leanora was indebted for those principles which influenced her conduct, and disposed her to acts of charity and benevolence. He had attended her from infancy, and devoted all his time and talents to her instruction. Antonio was a confessor to Leanora's grand-mother, in Portugal; and after her death, he accompanied her daughter to Mexico. This last, when on her death bed, conjured him never to forsake her daughter; but if she lived, to educate her in the principles of virtue and religion, and if possible, convey her from Mexico, which she detested. In short, she could not have consigned her daughter to the care of a more deserving man. He possessed all the elegance and refinement of a gentleman, and all the piety of a saint; and was, in every respect, the most amiable of his species; and through him his pupil became what she was, the mirror of every virtue. In a word, father Antonio was no other than Sir William? When Leanora's mother, to whom he was much attached, was carried off by her mother to Portugal, Antonio followed her thither; but before he could discover the place of her residence, she was married to Don Emanuel. Disappointed in his hopes, he became disgusted with the world, and took holy orders. Thus having devoted his life to the church, he assumed the name of Antonio, and under the disguise of a Spanish priest, became a confessor in the same family of her, who had once been the object of his ardent affection.— After the decease of the mother, he accompanied the daughter to Mexico, in the same capacity. Nor did she ever mistrust his person until he revealed it himself on her death bed. Horton continued to live happily with his wife, and was increasing rapidly in wealth and reputation. The M'Callester's had left New-York, Dr. N—, with whom I corresponded informed me; but whither they were gone, he knew not. The Simpsons still remain in Philadelphia. Clarissa, who corresponds with Mary, states that Eliza and Matilda are happily married to respectable mechanics, and the old lady resides with Eliza. Clarissa's husband continues to behave well; but his father will not suffer him to have any hand in money matters. Her own health, however, continues delicate, and a trip to the mineral springs of Virginia was prescribed by her physicians. Sullivan, also, remains in Philadelphia, it being better suited to his calling, which is that of a ship-carpenter. Jinkins had joined Ferdinand and the commodore, in mercantile business, and, out of respect for Jack, he refused to resume his father's name. Old Jack continues to live with Jinkins, who treats him with all the filial affection of a son. After the flurry of war, and my subsequent marriage was over, I had leisure to observe how uncle Thomas kept his reckoning with the young squadron. There were four. “Uncle,” said I one evenining, “how do you manage to steer clear of all those little ones? Do they not annoy you?” “An I han't been dinned wi' um till I be a most crazy. It be nothing but squalls, from mornin' till night.” “But your little Charles, (the name he gave his son,) is such a sweet little boy, you never get angry with him?” “Oh, I likes the little rogue well enough, when it be in good humor.” Old Sambo is in his glory, dandling his young master on his knee, and leading him about. After spending three weeks with my friends, at New-Orleans, I took leave of them, and set out for Tennessee, where I at present reside. Besides my wife, I was accompanied by her father, Antonio, and Dennis. Wilson and Mary choosing to spend the winter in New-Orleans. On our journey, our carriage broke down, in the night, within a few miles of Captain Wilson's. We were driving pretty fast, in order to reach the captain's that night, when one of the tires suddenly dropped from the wheel. The accident happened near a new log cabin, on the road-side; and, though the prospect was not very flattering, it was much better than spending the night in the woods. Taking Leanora's arm, I approached the house, and, relating our misfortune, asked accommodation for the night. “Lord save us!” said Matty, “if it isn't his honour. You are ten thousand times welcome. I'm sure, had it been my father out of the grave, I would not have been glader till see him. And do ye think, we were just talking about ye, the very minute ye spoke at the door.” I told her to get us something to eat—a cup of coffee or tea, if she had any, and prepare a place for Leanora to lie down, and the rest of us could sit up till morning. “And troth have I both tea and coffee, and good loafsugar; and do ye know, I have three as good featherbeds as ever ye slept on. Didn't I buy them wi' the money that your honur's uncle gift me? And troth, it was a lucky day that.” William had no opportunity to say a word, till Matty went to prepare supper; when he informed me that he had arrived in Tennessee, about four months before, and met with a kind reception from captain Wilson, with whom I had left directions to provide for him, if he should arrive in my absence; as I thought he might probably follow the advice which I gave him in New-York. In a short time, supper was ready. After doing particular honour to Matty's good things, we were all comfortably lodged, some on the floor and some on bedsteads, all in one room; while the family climbed up a ladder, into the loft, as these log cabins are called. Next morning I sent to captain Wilson's, which was only three miles distant, for a carriage, and proceeded to his house. Mrs. Wilson had been dead about six months. The old man, however, was alive and well, and often ensnares me into one of his long stories. Nor must I forget two other individuals, equally entitled to notice: I mean Unco and his uncle. Cold must be the heart, and lost to the best feelings of our nature would be the man, who would not do homage to virtues like theirs. To account for their attachment to the family of Leanora, it need only be mentioned, that they both owed their lives to the humanity of Leanora's mother. Shortly after her arrival in Mexico, these Indians were on some trivial account condemned to death; but through her intercession were pardoned, and ever after became strongly attached to her family. Old Pompey is still alive, (I mean when these memoirs were written in 1816) as fat as a seal, and as frolicsome as a colt, though his eye-sight is not so good as formerly. But the glory and amusement of my family, is Dennis, who is quite lifted up. “I always said so, I could see how it would end,” he would often say, “I always told my lady, you were not sent there for nothing.” The last I heard of my friends in New-Orleans, they were well, except that uncle Thomas, and his favorite Ling, were sometimes afflicted with the gout.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NOTE BY THE AUTHOR. The foregoing narrative, is principally taken from life. Many of the incidents having fallen under the notice of the author, to whom several of the leading characters were personally known, and are still living. The incidents, however, (many of them) are shifted from the actual places of occurrence. But the Tennessean being written before the author became acquainted with the Atlantic towns, proves that the selection of places has been very injudicious; particularly that of Boston. It is therefore nothing but an act of justice to that city, to declare that the incidents represented to have taken place there, happened much nearer the author's own door, and had it not been for deranging the unity of the narrative, this part of it would have been altered before the work went to press, as Boston is the last place, and the Author would be the last person to ascribe (even in fiction) incidents to that city so contrary to truth and justice.</field>
