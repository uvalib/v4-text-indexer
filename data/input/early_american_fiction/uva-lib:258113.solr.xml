      <field name="fulltext">Opinions of the Press. “The Quaker City.” Lippard's Newspaper. Published at 72 Chesnut St., Phila. $2 per year, or 20 copies for $20. Lippard's Quaker City is decidedly one of the most interesting papers received at this office. At every reception of that paper we cheerfully devote an hour or two to the perusal of its interesting contents. And we have reason to believe that we are not alone in our partiality for the “Quaker City.” But a very short time has elapsed since the commencement of its publication, and yet it already numbers some ten thousand subscribers. Lippard (he will not permit us to say Mr.) is a bold and fearless writer, ever ready to expose crime and vice alike, whether practiced by the lordling or the slave—under the sanctimonious garb of religion, or the more fashionable attire of the upstart and dandy. —Spirit of Democracy, Woodfield, Ohio. The editor is George Lippard, a man who has attended an exalted and enviable rank amongst our native writers, whose style is unique and attractive, and who comes nearer making words the embodiments rather than the substitutes of thoughts, than any man of his age. In his descriptive and narrative pieces, there is exhibited a graphic power of delineation rarely equalled and never excelled. Indeed, such is his sententious brevity of expression and his excellent selection of language, that he rather presents than describes. The image that he would depict is before you to the life — the thought that he would express is literally impersonated in language. No one can read his master-piece, “Washington and his Generals,” without experiencing the wizard influence of transcendant genius — the genius of George Lippard. — Eastern Sentinel, Paulding, Miss. “The Quaker City,” is the quaint title of a weekly paper published in Philadelphia, by Geo. Lippard &amp; Jos. Severns. Its success so far is beyond even the most sanguine anticipations of the publishers. It may seem incredible, but we have reason to know it is nevertheless true, that notwithstanding it has only reached the fifth issue, it already numbers among its readers, ten thousand good subscribers. We are pleased to note the fact, more particularly as we have an intimate acquaintance with both gentlemen. Mr. Lippard, the editor, is well known as the talented author of numerous standard works, much sought after; while the publisher, Mr. Severns, has a wide-spread popularity in the “Quaker City” for enterprise and ability in the publication of former public journals. — True American, Trenton, New Jersey. “The Quaker City,” is the title of a new mammoth weekly recently started in Philadelphia, by George Lippard, the author of the celebrated “Legends of the Revolution.” It is devoted to literature, and the work of moral reform. It is conducted in the editor's own peculiar style, and is a very readable and entertaining paper.—Trumbull County Whig, Warren, Ohio. Lippard's new paper—the Quaker City, we think, from its originality, its entire unlikeness to any of the other literary papers, is destined to have a large circuation. Lippard takes hold of some abuses with a giant grasp, abuses that must be grappled with sooner or later, if we would not have our religion a mockery, and our humanity a bye-word; and we say success to any man who devotes himself with heart and soul to the work. Lippard has great advantages for this work, situated as he is where he can see the worst results of the abuses or evils to which we refer, and possessing as he does the powers of description necessary to depict the evils in their real colors.—The Northern Tribune, Bath, Maine. The Quaker City newspaper will, we think, create quite a sensation in the romance reading world. The sheet is nearly equal in size to our largest Weeklies — the type is beautiful, leaving a full, clear, and bold impression, such as delights at once the eye and the fancy. The engravings too are admirable; but above all, the reading matter (there are no advertisements in the paper) is entirely original — the articles all lively, piquant and interesting — possessing that ease and grace of style which genius alone can impart. The subscription price is but two dollars per annum — we say but, for its certainly very low.—Democrat, Columbus, Miss. We desire to shake a huge grip of friendship with this Editor, and bid him “God speed.” He has undertaken to do what he will accomplish, and what should be accomplished in the world of literature, science, and true religion. We shall watch the progress of his “Memoirs” with interest, as we have read his prologue in the first number. Horace Greeley — “slovenly Horace” — has made a stir in the halls of Congress, a stir in the pocket, but George Lippard with his Quaker City, will make a stir in other high places, or we cannot read through the shadow of his futurity — a stir in the heart.—Expounder, Marshall, Mich. We have received the first number of this large weekly, literary paper, emanating as its name implies, from Philadelphia, and place it upon our already crowded exchange list. We do so in the first place, because it is edited by George Lippard, and in the second place because we love the name — having been borne and raised in that respectable denomination from which it derives its significant title. We hope to receive the paper regularly, and what can be done shall be done to further its circulation in this portion of the far west. — Gazette, Davenport, Iowa. Edited by George Lippard, who is too well known to the reading public as a great literary writer to need any commendation from our pen. The first number is on our table, and it is no disparagement to any of the weeklies to say it is equal to any paper we know of.—Illinois Revielle, Bloomington. Illi.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Prologue. LEGEND FIRST. THE LAST OF THE WASHINGTONS. “I was born of a noble ancestry,” said a great man who had risen from the kennel where Poverty hides its hopeless face—“True, my parents were poor, but three hundred years ago, the blood which flows in my veins, coursed in the veins of Lords, Archbishops, Counts, Dukes and Kings.” Then another Great Man, who had listened to this glorious boast made reply: “I also come of a noble lineage,” he said, “My parents it is true were rich, but three hundred years ago, the blood which flows in my veins, coursed in the veins—not of Count, Archbishop and King—but of the Hewer and Digger, of the Serf and the Worker, whose labors clothed the Lord, and gave bread to the King.” And the first great man laughed at the boast of the second. There was great reason for this laughter. Who would not sooner be descended from a King although a robber and assassin, than from a ragged Worker, who can boast no wealth save the heritage of want and hunger? For a King, although his hands are red with the blood of the innocent, and his fine apparel purchased with the misery of countless hearts, is yet a King; the head and fountain of all nobility. And a Serf, although his hands are unstained with blood, and his hard crust unpolluted by a single victim's tears, is still a Serf; the foundation stone of the world, on which Society is built; a very useful thing, but hidden in the darkness, by the great edifice of Wealth and Power. Let us illustrate this question by a Legend of a far distant age. Let us trace the Ancestry of a single Great Man—whom we select from the crowd of illustrious names—back to its very fountain, in this dim Heraldry of the Past. It has often come to me, clothed with strange and peculiar details, this Legend of a long past age. —The atmosphere of a luxurious chamber was burdened with sighs and prayers. It was a gorgeous apartment in the castle of a noble race; no display of sumptuous grandeur was lacking there, the walls were concealed by hangings of purple and gold, the dome-like ceiling was supported by marble columns. It was full of light and glitter, rich with fine linen and gold, and yet Death was there. He came not to strike the beautiful and the young; no full bosom of a trembling woman was there, to grow chill and dead at his kiss. His hand was extended to palsy an aged head, whose wrinkled forehead—wet with moisture—displayed the white hairs, venerable with the snows of eighty years. An old man was dying there. Not sinking feebly into the wave of Death, his senses wrapped in the fancies of delirium, nor yet with his chilled lips moving with one impatient moan. But sitting erect on his death-couch, the silken coverlet thrown aside from his wasted chest, his hands clasped, and his face, with the hair and beard, like drifted snow, turned to the light. Beneath his thick eyebrows, also snow-white, his grey eyes shone with an unfaltering glance. His gaze was centred on the light, and as the death-dew began to glisten on his forehead, and the blueish tint of the grave began to gather over the nails of his long white fingers, the old man, supported by silken pillows, never for one moment turned his eyes away. At the foot of the couch stood an altar on which the waxen candles burned with steady lustre. Their clear light shone upon the Image of the Saviour, sculptured in ivory, with his limbs nailed to the Cross, and a calm Divinity of Despair writhing over his Divine face. And at the foot of the bed beside the altar, was the armor and sword of the dying man. He was the last of his race. The sword was very bright; the armor shone like a mirror. He had worn it in the days of his young manhood—it had encased many a noble form of his race before he was born—that sword had flashed in the holy war of the crusade, and covered itself with the blood of Civil War. In his last moments, the old man, dying without an heir, sternly conscious that the fatal hour of his house was at hand—that the bright and bloody career of his race was about to end forever in his death—this brave old man, venerable with the trials of eighty years, gazed steadily upon the armor and the sword. Sometimes his glance wandered for a moment to the Divine Face, but as suddenly returned to the warrior array, which was piled up at the foot of the bed. The Priest, a hard, stern man with shaven crown and sombre apparel, colorless hands folded on his breast, and a dead vacant eye, glaring from compressed brows, stood near the bed, with the vessels of the Last Sacrament, arranged on the table by his side. But the old man did not heed him, nor turn his eyes for a moment to a pale faced woman who stood near the priest, and fixed her eyes upon her father's dying face, and wept without ceasing. It was his widowed daughter—his only child. Nay, there was another child, a younger daughter, but no one might speak her name, in this death-room, or the old man would couple that name with his dying curse. And beyond the altar, stand the servitors of his house, watching with dumb agony the last struggle of the dying Lord. Here are the soldiers who fought with him, in the days of old, and here the retainers who dwell on his broad lands, as their fathers have dwelt for ages past. The old man's lips moved— “He prays!” cried the widowed daughter, in an accent of joy, as her wasted face was bathed in tears. “He may relent—” “Never—” cried the Priest, with a scowl—“The old man is conscious that the honour of his house dies with him. His son fell in battle—you, Lady, are widowed—childless. As for Alice—” “My sister—” More gloomily scowled the Priest— “Do not breathe her name. Let the old man, even your father, Lord Ralph of Wyttonhurst, die in peace. Or wouldst thou have him go to the presence of his God with a curse upon his soul?” While the Priest and the woman by his side conversed in whispers, a dead awe had fallen upon all the other faces, which were clustered near the light, gazing upon the shrunken form and white-beared face of the dying Lord. For the first time in an hour he spoke — “Sword that my fathers bore to battle, you will rest upon my bosom when I am dust. There will be no hand to wield you when I am dead. Bury me —” he said, without once turning his eyes — “with my armour on, and my sword by my side. Let the banner of Wyttonhurst be taken from the hall, and wrap it about my coffin, so that all the world may know that the House of my Fathers is dead.” “Father —” said a low pleading voice, and the old man felt a warm hand upon his chilled fingers. “It is Mary —” he muttered, without turning his gaze — “A true daughter of our race. She will soon follow her father to the charnel. In all the world there will not be left a human thing with a drop of our blood in their veins.” And as a single tear rolled down his wasted cheek, he surrendered his thin hand — already damp with death — to the clasp of his faithful child. Her soft golden hair was already touched with grey; her cheeks had been robbed of their warm hues by the hard and bitter experience of life, and yet as she bent her face near to the stern visage of her father, not a heart in the dreary chamber but was touched by the sight. “Faithful,” murmured the old Lord — “True to the last.” Even the leaden visage of the Priest relented, and something like humanity lighted his dead eye-balls. “But Father —” and shuddering as she spoke, the widowed daughter enfolded him in her arms, and pressed her lips to his clammy face — “By the memory of that Saviour who smiles upon you now, I beseech you forgive your wandering child — forgive — your lost Alice! Do not, O, as the dread Hereafter already rushes upon your fading sight, do not curse your own flesh and blood.” Without a word, the old man raised his death-stricken arm, and gathering his failing strength for the effort, thrust her arms from his neck, her face from his cheek. His brow glowed with a stern, unforgiving look; the lines of his face grew suddenly rigid, as with the outward indications of an unrelenting Will. “Forgive her?” the cold tone of the Priest fell like ice upon the daughter's heart — “Did she not, child as she was of the old man's heart, betrothed to a Lord of noble lineage, forsake her father, her betrothed husband — leave these very walls—to share the fate of a —” “Low born peasant knave, who could not call one rood of ground his own.” “I know it —” the daughter exclaimed, as she confronted the Priest. “Yet still she is of our own blood. She is my sister. She is Alice of Wyttonhurst.” A murmur pervaded the apartment, and the eyes of the spectators was fixed upon the brave Woman, who true to the holiest instincts of her nature, dared even the anger of her dying father, in the attempt to wring from his chilled lips only one word of blessing, one accent of forgiveness. But no accent of forgiveness came — stern, cold and unrelenting he gazed upon the armour, the sword and the image of the Dying Redeemer, murmuring with his husky voice, a curse upon Alice, his Lost Daughter. And when the Priest was encircled by white-robed children with silver censers swinging in their little hands — when the words of the Last Sacrament trembled from his lips, rolling in full deep melody through the dreary chamber — while the daughter knelt by the bed, and the servitors were bowing their heads against the floor — still, with a stern resolve upon his forehead, the old Lord, sat erect on his couch, coupling with a curse the name of the younger daughter, Alice. Shall we leave this scene, where Death is clad in grandeur and vengeance? In order to comprehend it more fully, shall we behold death, rudely clad in misery and chains? In a cell, sunken far below the surface of the earth — with a huge mass of walls and chambers between its arched ceiling and the light of the stars—an Executioner, torch in hand, came to look upon his victim. He stood in the centre of the damp cell, his pale face, with cold eyeballs and thin severe lips, standing out from his black cowl. For the Executioner did not appear in the form of a Headsman with a sharp axe in his brawny hand, but as a Monk with the cold sneer on his withered lips, a calm scorn in his impassible eyes. Above him frowned the arch of the cell — around him, brooded the shadows, through whose darkness the moisture on the thick walls, shone with a pale dreary lustre. At his feet, crouching on a rude seat — a solid block of stone — was his Prisoner or victim, chained by the wrists and ancles to the floor. The light of the torch disclosed him, as bowing his head between his hands — they rested on his knees — he seemed to be lost to all consciousness in a miserable repose. “One year of night and silence, will wither the bravest form! A year ago, across the threshold he stepped, with a bold and agile stride, and as the door grated behind him, a smile flashed over his features. Look upon him, now —” Nearer to the couching form, the spectator held his light. But the Prisoner did not move. It was pitiable to see him, as he sat upon the hard stone, irons upon his wrist, and chains extending from his ancles to the massy ring in the centre of the floor. It was but the wreck of a man. A muscular form, broad in the chest, majestic in the stride, wrecked suddenly into a living skeleton, whose fleshless arms and gaunt outlines, the rays which fluttered about him could not altogether hide. Such was the Prisoner of that cell, whose Night was Eternal. Once his hands wandered amid tangled masses of dark hair, streaked with grey. It was a large head, but the pale face could not be seen, for the chained hands veiled it from the light. “For one year he has not beheld the light of day. A morsel of coarse bread, a cup of water, thrust through the door of his cell — such has been his food for a year. He cannot last much longer —” The Prisoner moved; his chains aroused the echoes of the cell. A miserably wasted face, with eyes hollow and wild, glowed in the light. There was a broad forehead, marked eyebrows, but the eyes were sunken in their sockets, the cheeks hollow, the lips — parting in an idiotic smile — chill and colorless. He turned his face from the light, as though its glare smote his eyeballs with deadly anguish — and then shading his sight with his chained hands looked vacantly into the impassible face of his Gaoler. Do you feel that picture, in all its details? Far above this solitary wretch, arise the walls, the corridors, the huge roof and slender spires of this immense edifice; and far above, the light of the midnight stars shines upon the Cross, until it glitters like a brighter star above the venerable pile. Far above, there are free fields, and wide forests, the fields white with snow and the forests desolate with winter — yet still they are free. And here, in the cell, which resembles a coffin, with its low ceiling and narrow walls, a living man withers inch by inch to death and feels that his voice is drowned by the impenetrable stone that shut him in. Feels that this cell is not merely the Prison of his Body but the Coffin of his Soul. He is shut off, forever, from society and the sympathies of mankind. When he dies no tear will moisten his cold face. Not one pitying eye will look into the recesses of his accursed grave. Ah, the reality of death like this, would chill the heart of the bravest man that ever dared death on the battle-field. — The wasted man looked up, and murmured two syllables, that may seem to us, but feeble and incoherent — “Wife — child —” he said, and bowed himself to his chains again. Then the cold sneer of his Executioner, was lengthened out in measured words: “A serf — a hewer of wood and drawer of water — you dared to love the lady of a noble house. A man of no name, born to hew and dig, as your fathers before you were born, you dared to open the Book of God, and read its pages for yourself. But the strong arm of the Church, came suddenly down upon your head. The wife whom you had dared to take to yourself was doomed to the silence and secrecy of a convent — and you — miserable man! Do you remember your sentence — as it fell from the lips of your Judges, only a year ago —” The Prisoner moved not, but a groan was heard. “Eternal seclusion from the face of man.” This was the word pronounced upon your head by the Church and the Law. `Only once a year, you shall be permitted to see the face of a human being. The hand of mercy will be extended to you, in case you renounce at once your wife, and the heresy which you have wrung from the pages of the Book of God.' I am here to offer that mercy — say that the lady Alice is no longer wife of yours — say that you believe no longer your damnable heresy but in our Church — and you shall live!” It seemed as if the sneering tone and contemptuously offered mercy of the Monk, had roused the wasted man into a new life. “You come too late,” he sadly said, raising his hollow eyes — “That which you call my heresy, has been my only stay, my unfaltering hope, through the endless Night of this living grave. Shall I renounce it now, and lie basely, as I am about to go into the presence of my God? Alice — renounce her? Wherefore? We will soon be joined again, where there are neither locks nor bolts; not much of Church or King; nothing but children whose Father is the living God.” Not very boldly did he speak these words. Faltering in every accent, his eyes vacant and dreary all the while, his hands trembling in their chains, he spoke with great difficulty, pausing for breath between every word. “You come too late,” and he bowed his head without a groan. For a long while he was silent, while the Monk holding the torch above his wasted form, looked upon him with the same impassible scorn. At last, startled by the breathless stillness of his prisoner, he went to him, and shook him by the shoulder, but the Prisoner moved not, nor uttered one moan. The Monk rudely raised his head from his fettered hands, and saw at once that he was Dead. He too was the last of his race, the last Peasant of his name. Or had he yet a child? No wife — no child? Yet even as the light flashed vividly upon his wasted form, and tinted with a red glare his motionless eye-balls, there was something upon his face, which spoke of Peace. A smile hung around his chilled lips; there was no sorrow in the solitary tear which bathed his check. The sneer passed from the spectator's face. He could not but look with something like pity upon the dead man. As he suffered the head to fall once more upon the hands, a bright object escaped from the rags which bound the shrunken chest, and fluttered to the floor. The Monk raising it, beheld a dingy piece of parchment, on which, in the rude yet nervous old English character, certain strange words were written: “The spirit of Jehovah is upon me to preach good tidings to the Poor.” These words (whose orthoepy we have modernized) were all that the strip of parchment contained, but the Monk pondered upon them for a long time, wondering from what strange book they could have been taken. And ere many hours were passed, a slab was lifted from the prison floor, and the unshrouded corse of the prisoner, hurled into the cavity which yawned beneath. He was forgotten — lost in the great abyss of the past. And yet perchance, his blood did not altogether die, his spirit altogether fade, as they placed the stone upon his breast, and left him to his long repose. Turn we once more, to the gorgeons chamber of the ancient baronial hall. The last sacrament has been said — the breath of incense yet lingers in the air. Around the room still gather the servitors of the noble house; the Priest kneels by the bed; the widowed daughter above is absent from the scene. The old man in the same position in which we last beheld him, crosses his hands upon his breast, and gazes upon the woman, the sword, and Holy Image. There is a glassier light in his eye, the moisture starts more brightly from his forehead; his hands are blue with the death-chill. The same ray which warms his face, glistens upon the woman, and the rich purple hangings of the death-chamber. — Gaze upon this scene, compare it with the miserable death, which but a moment since took place, far down in the dreary atmosphere of the coffin-like cell. It is indeed a widely different scene. Here death is invested with the splendors of rank, and grows less terrible under the weight of purple and gold — there, a ghostly thing of rags and famine appears in lurid torch-light; and a face withered, not by age nor disease, but by the pang of persecution, rests between hands which are heavy with a felon's chains. It was near the daybreak hour, when the dawn began to steal through the curtained windows, that a woman's form stole through the silent watchers and advanced to the bedside. “Father,” she whispered, and placed his chilled fingers upon a little hand — not her own — which did not shrink from the old man's dying grasp. He turned and gazed upon his widowed daughter. “I am dying,” he faltered; “Alice—” he murmured the name of his lost daughter, but seemed to hesitate as the curse hung on his lips. “She died to-night,” said the faithful Daughter — “Died in the Convent, amid the Nuns, who could not but weep as they saw her glide so pale and brokenhearted into the arms of death. She died but —” Once more she placed this little hand within his own. “Behold her child!” It was a brown-haired boy, not more than four years old, who looked with a vague wonderment into the old man's face. He was coarsely attired, like the child of a peasant, but his eyes were round and bright, his warm cheek full of health. The stern Baron looked upon that wondering child, as though he would have killed him with the last glance of his glassy eyes. But the boy clung to his withered breast, crept tremblingly up the side of the high couch, and wound his little arms around the gaunt limbs of the dying man. “Have you a Mother, child — a Father —” gasped the Baron, as his senses began to wander in the mists of death. The Boy looked upon him with a vacant stare. “Father”—“Mother” — these words sounded as an unknown language in his ears. They had torn him, when a babe, from his mother's breast. He had never seen his Father's face. Therefore with his large black eyes dilating with a stare of child-like wonder, he gazed vacantly into the death-stricken face of the great Baron. “Had I but a child like thee —” the old man gasped — “To wear my sword, and bear my banner forth to battle! Curses, curses upon the child who fled from my roof with a low-born peasant! Had she but wedded one of her own rank, her child might have taken the name of our House. A peasant's wife! Thy name, my pretty one — it is pleasant to feel thy kindly eyes upon me — thy name!” The Boy in his clear silvery voice uttered a name — “The peasant's child!” cried the old man with an oath that came with his last breath — “The child of Alice and her peasant husband!” with the last impulse of his strength — while death came coldly over every sense — he dashed the boy aside, and fell back stiff and dead. A wonderful thing it was to see that little child crouching on the silken coverlet, his rosy cheeks and great dark eyes, contrasting so strongly with the dead eyeballs and fallen jaw of the great Lord. A peasant's child, pressing the downy pillow of a dead Lord! Even in death the old man's face seemed to sneer at the thought, and the frightened boy crept slowly from his side. And yet in distant ages — from this drear night of the fifteenth century, when we stand beside the deathbed of a Lord — the name of that Peasant Boy, may be a nobler name, than all the Wyttonhursts of the English Island. Aye nobler than Lancaster or Plantagenet, nobler than all the names inscribed on the blood red scroll of British Heraldry — For the child, trembling on the death-couch of the Baron, the Son of the Peasant, who died alone in his dungeon coffin, was named Lawrence Washington. Could that dying Baron have looked into the future, through the mists of three centuries, he might have seen a descendant of that peasant child, in the person of — George Washington</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEGEND SECOND. THE MOTHER'S PRAYER. A mother on her knees, stretching forth her hands over her slumbering child, while through the gloom of twilight her soul, shining from her uplifted eyes, ascends in voiceless communion with God — Was it in a Palace, where a Royal Babe, wrapped in purple, clutches a seeptre for a plaything, and only uncloses its eyes to behold scenes of luxury — trains of liveried and titled lacquies — magnificent halls, looking out from their lofty windows upon gardens peopled with armed vassals? Was it a royal mother, like that doll of legitimacy, Maria Louisa, whose veins were stagnant with the royal blood of ten centuries, whose silken vestment never once moved to one throb of womanly feeling, warm from a Mother's heart? Was it an imperial babe that met her gaze; a tiny thing, fated to be King of Rome to-day, and to-morrow but the child of an Imperial Outeast, chained by British hands to an isolated rock in the centre of an ocean? No. The Mother was neither Queen nor Empress; she knelt at the evening hour, in a chamber of her home, where the last ray of sunset, trembling through an opened window, bathed with the same flush her face and the face of the sleeping babe. And the breeze that came over fields, just blooming into verdure, was imbued with the delicious perfume of early summer. And the sun which, setting, flung its beams upon the faces of Mother and Child, was sinking in a blue vault, undimmed by a single cloud. And the Home was a plain wooden building, one story in height, standing amid trees and gardens near the water-side. One hundred and sixteen years have passed since that hour, and yet the scene is fresh before us still. Let us invoke the memory of the Past, and paint that scene upon the heart of every American Mother. In a room, whose old fashioned furniture — pictures on the wainscot walls, a couch in one corner, floor white as snow, and table on which was placed a Bible — was shadowed by the gloom of twilight, the Mother knelt, her face toward the setting sun. Through an open casement — fringed with a young vine, amid whose tender leaves, delicate flowers, white and beautiful as snow-drops in the moonlight—came the breeze and sunshine, filling the dim room with gleams of light and odours of leaves and flowers. The Mother was kneeling in the recess of that window — a pale woman, whose matronly forehead was radiant with the divine tenderness of a Mother's love, whose eyes uplifted — shining in their tears — were instinct with a Mother's Soul. Her cheeks glowed with a flush of crimson, as she stretched her thin white hands above the child. And the child, resting on a pillow, its tiny hands clasped and its eyes sealed in slumber — it was altogether a fragile thing, a frail embodiment of an immortal soul. As the sunshine stole in glimpses over its face, and turned the marble whiteness of its little hands to coral, a solitary flower fell from the vine above, and trembled down upon it, and rested like a Blesing upon its breast. Altogether, this humble apartment, furnished in the plain style of the olden time — the open casement fringed with vines — the Mother kneeling, and the Babe slumbering with the white flower on its bosom — presented a scene not at all worthy of the sage Historian who can only picture intrigue and bloodshed, but rather the simple chronicler, whose pencil and whose heart lingers ever amid the holy quietude of — Home. And as the breeze lifted the brown hair of the Mother, she stretched forth her hands, and her soul went up to God in a voiceless Prayer. Oh, there was a world of eloquence in that pale face, glowing in sunset, and impassioned with a Mother's Love! Shall we translate that Prayer into the lame word of sound? "Father in Heaven! Behold this Babe that slumbers now, with an Immortal Soul beating silently in its bosom. Shall this child, now dawning into life, ripen into virtuous manhood, and sleep after the toil of this world in a blessed grave ? Or, shall he live to curse his race, and after a life of infamy moulder to dust, with no tear to sanctify his ashes?" It was this Thought that gave such divine eloquence to the Mother's face—The Future of Her Child And as her voiceless prayer went up to God, it seemed to her that the sunset sky, and the river flowing among fields of corn, passed suddenly away. All became dark night around her. And through the dead stillness of night, came a voice which spoke not so. much to her ear as to her soul—"Mother! Behold the Future life of this child, which now slumbers beneath your gaze." O! beautiful and wondrous was the Vision, or the Dream, or the Reality, which then came gliding upon the Mother's eyes. It was a prospect of green hills, undulating beside tumultuous waters, and centred in the bosom of a silent wilderness. And on a rock beside the waters, which, plunging over a crag, howled in the abyss far beneath, stood a youth of eighteen years, clad in back-woodsman's garb, staff in hand and pilbrim's wallet on his back. His face turned to the setting sun, glowed at once with the beauty of youth and the silent beauty of precocious Thought. The Mother's eyes lingered long upon this lonely boy, standing over the abyss, in the drear wilderness. She clasped her hands—she asked the meaning of this scene. "It is in the wilderness that the heart of the boy will ripen into virtuous manhood. For as he walks the wilderness —alone with God and his own Soul —God's voice will speak to him, with the memory of a Mother's Prayers." The scene was gone—gone the hills, the abyss, the boy of eighteen, standing on the isolated rock. The scene which the Mother beheld made the blood run cold in her veins. It was a Battle among wild hills—clouds of lurid smoke, rolling over heaps of dead, whose glassy eyes shone mockingly in the red light. Red men were there, murdering in stealth, from the shelter of a log or tree—and there legions of armed men, in scarlet array, marched in exact order to their certain Death. But there was one form, a youth of twenty-three, mounted on a dark bay horse, who won at once the Mother's eye. Where the fight was most terrible, where the yell of dying men mingled most fiercely with the red man's war-whoop—he was there. Ever the same, a gallant youth of magnificent form, and grey eyes dilating with a hero's soul. And the dying raised their pale faces to behold him as he went by, and their lips grew cold forever in the act of blessing his name. How the Mother's heart expanded in her bosom, as she beheld this scene! But ah, sad and fearful change ! His horse is wounded—he totters, he reels, and buries his rider under his writhing body. There is a terrible pause. At last, covered with blood, the fallen Rider springs to his feet and beholds the foe who wounded his horse, and aimed the bullet at his own heart—he beholds the foe on his knees, beaten down by a friendly sword. Does he slay the fallen foe ? The Mother holds her breath as she watches the issue of the scene. Ah, he raises his hand, the youth of twenty-three, but it is to bear his enemy aside from the roar of the conflict, and rest his shattered limbs by the river side, under the shade of a great oak tree. And then, once more through the silence comes a voice—"Behold your son in Battle! Strong in the Right, he prepares himself on the dreary hill-side for a wider field, a nobler cause. He cannot strike the fallen, nor pursue the suppliant foe, for the for the memory of his Mother's Prayer is with him now." And thus, from scene to scene, the Mother beheld spreading before her, the great drama of her Child's Future. The scenes that she saw, the battles she beheld, would crowd a volume. There was a dark river, burdened with ice, and heaving sullenly in the grey winter's dawn. Her Son, the Babe which sleeps before her, grown to mature manhood, was upon that river, guiding the wreck of an army to the opposite shore, and speaking to half-naked and starving men the bold thoughts of Freedom. There was a scene of cheerless hills, crowded by miserable huts, whose rugged timbers rose gloomily from amid a wide waste of snow. Starvation was there, and Plague and Cold, doing their three-fold work upon a band of heroes. But there, upon his knees, in his warrior uniform, praying to God for his men — offering up his life as a sacrifice for his country — there was the leader of this band, whose great soul shone in his form and features, and in his more than kingly presence. The Mother knew that Face! It was her son; and the voice which she had heard before she heard again — “Your son, become the Leader of a People, defies Hunger, Plague, and Cold, and holds the serenity of his soul against foes abroad and traitors at home, for God's voice speaks to him again in the Memory of his Mother's Prayer.” At last there came a scene which filled every avenue of her heart with joy — joy too deep for words or tears. A man of more than regal presence stood among a countless multitude of freemen, and while their shouts went up to Heaven, he gave back into their hands the sword which had achieved their Freedom. And in that moment, his large grey eyes flashing as they gazed upon the countless multitude, brightened with a kindlier, holier lustre, as the heart of the Great Man was filled with the Memory of his Mother's Face — of that gentle voice which had whispered Religion in his ear — of that Soul which had infused its holy nature into his own breast — These scenes the Mother beheld with every varied emotion. But the last scene fired every pulse with a calm rapture, and shed the baptism of unutterable peace upon her soul. But once more that voice, which came through darkness and silence, spoke to her — “Mother! This will be the life of your babe, in case you are true to your trust. For God gives into every Mother's hands the life, the Destiny of her child.” Then, after the voice was still, came a scene at once dark and crushing. With chilled blood and a heart slowly struggling under an overwhelming Terror, the Mother beheld it — a Dream composed of a succession of vivid pictures. First, a wild boy standing upon a vessel's deck, amid the darkness of an ocean storm. His defiant lip and blasphemous eye, his hand uplifted in scorn at the lightning which circled over him — twining among the clouds like a fiery serpent over a pall — all attested a reckless and outcast soul. No Mother's Prayer shed its blessing on his corrugated brow — no memory of a Mother's teachings came to bless the heart of the Outcast Boy. And the Outcast Boy ripened into a Murderer before the Mother's eyes — and the Murderer became a Pirate — and at last the dread drama terminated on a desert island, on whose bleak shore a skeleton, washed by the waves from its rude grave, glared whitely in the tropic sun. And the skeleton — all that remained of the Murderer and the Pirate — was her son, the Babe which now slumbered beneath her outspread hands! “There is no blessing upon the Skeleton, for no Mother's Memory comes to blossom in good deeds over the dead”— She heard the voice once more — “And this, O Mother, will be the Future of your child, deprived of a Mother's teachings and a Mother's prayer.” With the last accent of that voice her vision passed away. The Babe was still there — slumbering in the twilight hour — with its hands clasped and the white flower upon its heart. An image of Peace — a glimpse of Eden — centred in the serenity of the summer twilight, seemed that Child slumbering beneath its Mother's gaze. Her mind still agitated by her Dream — with its terrible picture of a child unblest by a Mother's Prayer; and its divine picture of a child hallowed by that Prayer — she turned from the window, leaving the Babe in the shadowy recess. The ray of a candle trembled through the gloom. The candle stood upon a table, which, covered with a white cloth, resembled an altar. Upon the cloth, beside the candle, appeared a white urn, or vase, filled with clear cold water. And there stood a man of venerable presence, a Minister of God, with the father of the babe at his side. The wrinkled face, the white hair of the Preacher, were in strong but not unpleasing contrast with the young manhood of the Father. Around were grouped a few friends — men and women, whose faces appeared in the dim light, and who had come to witness the Baptism of the Child. And the Mother bore the Babe from its resting place — it opened its eyes as she raised it, and clutched the stray flower with its tiny hand. And she stood by the baptismal vase, while the holy words were said, while the withered hand of the Priest sprinkled the blessed drop upon the white brow of that sinless babe, and all the while it gazed wonderingly around clutching the stray flower in its little hand. And that tiny hand should one day clutch a Battle Blade, and carve a Nation's Freedom with a Hero's Sword. Holy were the words which fell from the lips of the Preacher — holy the baptism which he sprinkled upon the brow of unconscious innocence — but the Mother, as she girdled the Babe to her bosom and remembered her dream, could not banish the thought — that the holiest baptism which Earth could offer up to the eye of God — holier than words, or forms, or sprinkled water — was the Baptism of a Mother's Prayer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEGEND THIRD. THE YOUTH OF WASHINGTON. It is not the most difficult thing in the world to write the history of a battle. The tramp of legions, the crash of contending foemen, the waving of banners — arms glittering here, and the cold faces of the dead glowing yonder, in the battle flash — these form a picture that strikes the heart at once, and makes its mark forever. But who can write the history of a Soul? Who can tell how the germ of heroism, the idea of greatness first swells in the mind of the Boy, and slowly ripens into full life? We have seen Washington the President. We have known Washington the General. Shall we look into the soul of Washington the Boy? Shall we behold the almost imperceptible gradations which marked the progress of that soul into manhood? Shall we witness the silent, gradual, ceaseless EDUCATION of that soul? How was Washington educated? Did he lounge away five years of his life within the walls of a college, occupied in removing the shrouds from the mummies of Classic Literature, busy in familiarizing his mind with the elaborate pollutions of Grecian mythology, or in analyzing the hollow philosophies of the academy and portico? No. His education was on a broader, vaster scale. At seventeen he leaves the common school, where he had received the plain rudiments of an English education, and with knapsack strapped to his shoulders, surveyor's instruments in his hand, he goes forth, a pilgrim among the mountains. Where there is blue sky, where the tumultuous river hews its way through colossal cliffs, where the great peaks of the Alleghanies rise like immense altars into the heavens — such were the scenes in which the soul of Washington was educated. He went forth a wanderer into the wilderness. At night he stretched his limbs in the depths of the forest, or rose to look upon the stars, as they shone in upon the awful night of the wilderness, or sat down with the red men by their council fire, and learned from this strange race the traditions of the lost nations of America. Three years of his life glide away while he sojourns among the scenes of nature's grandeur. Those three years form his character, and shape his soul. Glimpses of the future come upon him like those blushes of radiance in the day-break sky, which announce the rising of the sun. Shall we learn the manner of his communion with nature and with God? We know it is beneath the dignity of history to look even for an instant into the heart. We know that vague generalities, misty outlines, compact and well-proportioned falsehoods, sprinkled with a dash of what is called philosophy — too often constitute the object and the manner of history. Shall we depart a little while from the respectable regularities of history, which too often resemble the regular tactics of Braddock on his fatal field, and call tradition and legend to our aid? Tradition and legend, which, in their vivid but irregular details, remind us forcibly of the crude style of battle which young Washington so fruitlessly commended to the notice of the regular general, on the battle day of Monongahela. Learn, then, the manner of young Washington's communion with nature and with God. But first learn and know by heart the scenes in which his boyhood passed away. Over a tumultuous torrent, high in the upper air, there hangs a bridge of rock, fashioned by the hand of Nature, with the peaks of granite mountains for its horizon. Two hundred feet above the foaming waves you behold this arch, which in its very ruggedness, looks graceful as a floating scarf. Over the waves, looking through the arch, you catch a vision of colossal cliffs, with a glimpse of smiling sky. Advance to the parapet of this bridge — cling to the shrubs that grow there — look below! Your heart grows sick — your brain reels. Stand in the shadow of the arch, and look above. How beautiful! While the torrent sparkles at your feet, yonder, in the very Heaven, the Arch of Rock fills your eye, and spans the abyss, with giant trees upon its brow. To the Natural Bridge, Washington, the young pilgrim came. He stood by the waves at sunset — he drank in the rugged sublimity of the scene. And when the morning came, with an unfaltering step, and hand that never shook, not for an instant, with one pulse of fear, he climbed the awful height — he wrote his name upon the rock — he stood upon the summit, beneath the tall pine, and saw the march of day among the mountains. Who shall picture his emotions in that hour? As his unfaltering hand traced the name upon the rock, did he dream of the day when that name should be stamped upon the history of his country, and written not in stone, but in the throbs of living hearts? As he stood upon the arch, and saw the torrent sparkle dimly far below, while the kiss of light was glittering on the mountain tops, did no vision of the battle field, no shadowy presentiment of glory, gleam awfully before his flashing eyes? Again; another scene of Washington's education. There is a river which sparkles beautifully among its leafy banks — glides on as smoothly as the dream of sinless slumber; but even as you gaze upon its glassy waves, it rushes from your sight. It glides over a bed of rocks, and then through a yawning abyss sinks with one sullen plunge into the bosom of the earth. On one side you behold its smooth waters — at your feet the abyss — and yonder, an undulating meadow. Yes, where should be the course of the river, you behold slopes of grass and flowers. It is simply called the Lost River. It fills you with inexplicable emotions to see this beautiful stream, now flashing in the sunlight, now — ere you can count one — lost in a dismal cavern, with flowers growing upon its grave. Here Washington, the young pilgrim, wandered oftentime, and gazed with a full heart upon the mysterious river. “Shall my life be like that river? Gliding smoothly on — shining in sunlight, only to plunge, without a moment's warning, into night and eternity.” Did no thought like this cross the young pilgrim's soul? In that wondrous river he beheld a symbol of a brave life, suddenly plunged in darkness. Or, it may be, of a great heart, hurled into obscurity, only to rise more beautiful and strong, after the night was over and the darkness gone. For after three miles of darkness, the lost river comes sparkling into light again, singing for very gladness, as it rushes from the cavern into open air. Amid scenes like these the youth of Washington was passed. He grew to manhood amid the glorious images of unpolluted nature. Now, pausing near the mountain top, he saw the valleys of Virginia fade far away, in one long smile of verdure and sunshine, with the Potomac, like a silver thread, in the distance. Now battling for life, amid hunger, snow, and savage foes, he makes his bed in the hollow of the rock, or sets his destiny afloat amid the waves and ice of a wintry river. There is one picture in the life of Washington, the Boy, which has ever impressed my soul. It is not so much that picture of young Washington, seated at the feet of his widowed mother, gazing into her pale face, drinking the fathomless affection of her mild eyes, and for her sake renouncing the glittering prospect of an ocean life, and laurels gathered from its gory waves. This picture, in its simplicity, is very beautiful. 3 But it is another picture which enchains me. Behold it. By the side of a lonely stream, in the depth of a green woodland, sits a boy of fourteen — shut out from all the world, alone with his heart — his finger laid upon an opened volume, while his large grey eye gazes vacantly into the deep waters. And that volume is the old Family Bible, marked with the name of his ancestor, John Washington; and from its large letters look forth the Prophets of Israel, and from its pages, printed in antique style, the face of Jesus smiles in upon the soul of the dreaming boy. Washington the boy, alone with the old Bible which his ancestor, a wanderer and an exile, brought from the English shore — alone with the prophets and the warriors of long distant ages — shut in from the world by the awful forms of revelation — now wandering with the Patriarchs under the shade of palms, among the white flocks — now lingering by Samaria's well, while the Divine voice melts in accents of unutterable music upon the stillness of noonday. Let us for a few moments survey the various EPOCHA of the youth of Washington. At the age of ten years he is left an orphan; from the hour of his father's death he is educated by his widowed mother. At the age of fourteen a midshipman's warrant is offered to him — with a brilliant prospect of naval glory in the distance. He accepts the warrant — his destiny seems trembling in the balance — when his mother, who already saw a nobler theatre open before her boy, induces him to surrender the idea of an ocean life. He is seventeen when he takes up the instruments of the surveyor's craft, and crossing the Alleghanies, beholds, for the first time, the customs of the Indian people. Three years pass, and he is a pilgrim amid the forms of external nature. We behold him on the ocean, amid the terror of its storms, and very near the doom of its shipwrecks. His heart pillows the head of a dying brother; he accompanies Laurence Washington on a voyage to Barbadoes, and is absent on the ocean, and on the shores of a strange land, from the fall of 1751 until the spring of 1752. When Laurence dies, his young brother, George Washington, a youth of twenty years, is appointed executor of his immense estates. At the age of twenty-one, he is designated by the Governor of Virginia as a Commissioner to treat with the hostile French and their Indian allies, who threaten our western borders. In the pursuit of the object of this mission, he journeys 560 miles into the trackless wilderness. He is twenty-two when he first mingles in battle; his sword is unsheathed July 3, 1754, at the fight of the Great Meadows. And at the age of twenty-three, July 9th, 1775, he shares in the dangers of Braddock's field, and saves the wreck of the defeated army. The great epochs of the Youth of Washington are written in the preceding paragraphs. A wonderful youth indeed! From the common school-house into the untrodden wilderness; from the couch of a dying brother into the terror of battle, Washington had already lived a life, before he was twenty-three years old. Let us, my friends, write the unwritten history of Washington, Not the dim outline which History sketches, but a picture of the Man — with color, shape, life and voice. Yes, life; for as we go on, among the shrines of the Past, the dead will live with us; and voice, too; for as we question the ghosts of other days, they will answer us, although the shadows of a hundred years brood over their graves. And ere we hasten forth upon our journey, let us for a moment compare the youth of Washington with the boyhood of Arnold. Washington, nourished by the counsels of a mother, surrounded by powerful friends, and with many a kind hand for his brow when it was stricken with fever, many a kind voice for his heart when it was heavy with sorrow. Arnold, a friendless boy, left by an intemperate father to the — world; guided, it is true, by a kind mother, but a mother who saw all the clouds of misfortune lowering upon her path, and felt the heaviest blows of misery upon her breast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEGEND FOURTH. THE BOY AND THE BOOK. One hour of silence and of thought. Who shall paint its history? What power of language, what eloquence of speech, can paint the day-dreams that come like ghosts over the mind of boyhood, and fling their shadowy hands toward a distant but a gorgeous future? One summer day, upon a rock which overhung a wood-embosomed brook, there sat a boy of fourteen years, clasping his hand over a book which rested on his knee, while his absent gaze was fixed upon the wave below. That wave, framed in foliage, mirrored in a cloudless sky, warmed by the rays of a declining sun. The slender form of the boy was clad in a dress of coarse grey; his falling collar disclosed his white throat; his brown hair, shadowed features remarkable at once for their firmly chisseled outlines, and their expression of precocious thought. Those grey eyes, warming and dilating under the boldly defined brows, shone with the rapture of some absorbing day-dream. Near the boy, reclining on the rock which overhung the stream, arose an aged oak, whose massive trunk was garlanded with vines, while it extended one rugged and gnarled limb, thick with leaves, over the bosom of the waters. And the boy reclining on the rock, and the old tree clad in vines, looked, together, like an image of Youth stretched at the feet of the venerable Past. On the rock, beside the boy, were scattered various things which seem to indicate the sports of youth, mingled with the grave thought of manhood. A bow and three arrows — a compass — a fishing rod, and a rusted sword, battered in the handle and dented in the blade. But the eye of the boy was fixed upon the waters with a dreamy, absent glance. He sat for a long time like a statue — a dumb thing, without power of speech or motion — his clasped hands lay upon the old book, supported by his knee. Vines, whose green leaves embraced flowers white as snow, were dipping in the waters with every breath of the summer air — a solitary bird hung trembling on the oaken bought, singing as it swung, and filling the place with bursts of wild music — the sun bathed the mass of foliage with his rays, while yonder wall of leaves was veiled in shadows — it was a beautiful scene, an hour of peace, but the soul of the boy was far away. Once in the space of an hour he moved his head. It was to grasp the hilt of the rusted sword. Then something like a shadow passed over his face, and his lip curled in a kind of defiant smile. Next his hand rested upon the book. A massive volume, bound in dark leather, with the traces of age upon its broad leaves, the odor of time upon its bold and rugged type. He lifted one lid of the book, and a blank leaf was revealed — blank, save that it bore a name, written in a quaint, round hand — JOHN WASHINGTON — 1657. For this book, more than a hundred years old, had been brought from England by the grandfather of this boy, at least one hundred years before this summer day. That ancestor, an exile from his native soil, brought the book with him to the wilds of Virginia, and, believe me, it brought a blessing with it: for, after soothing many an hour of pain — lifting up many a head bowed down by sickness — nerving many a heart chilled by death — the book was now, even in this calm summer hour, doing its yet baptised in its first hour by the rays of a star, that melted into the heart at once, and filled it with a Peace unutterable. The Boy read on. The Child, grown to Boyhood, stands up in a lofty temple, and confutes grave Doctors and learned Scribes — heaps confusion upon their cunning and puts their intricate code of lies to shame — by the simple learning of a Heart that cannot Hate, a Heart that finds Truth and Law and Religion in the simple words —“Love one another.” Then came scenes that made the heart of the boy beat with pulsations of vivid joy, succeeded by oppressive sadness. His eyes were drowned in tears. For the Child of whom he read, had grown to manhood. He was derided by the Priests, mocked by the minions of Kings, crowned with thorns, and put to death on a felon's tree — every instant of his agony, accompanied by some unutterable mockery. And with all this — He — the being of whom the Boy was reading — gave to his enemies love for their scorn, blessings for their blows — yes, to the World which disowned him, and raised him in mockery upon its breast, he bequeathed a deathless Testament of Forgiveness, a holy Covenant of Brotherhood. And while the Boy was reading, the evening shadows fell. The sun passed down the sky, leaving only one smile of light upon the waters. And yet the Face of the Divine Being seemed to start from the very gloom, and look with its deathless eyes into the very eyes of the dreaming Boy. Do you assert that the lesson which the old Book taught to the mind and the heart of the Boy — in this still hour — ever lost its influence, ever passed away? Or, did the words of the Book, dropping imperceptibly into the heart of that Boy — gentle as fragrant rain upon an opening flower and yet mightier than armies — appear in his Future life, in the shape of Deeds that win the love of a World? Who shall count the imperceptible steps by which the soul of youth ascends to manhood, gathering fresh vigor at every step, and coming freer and bolder into the light, as the summit grows near and nearer? Who shall estimate the influence which the old Book exercised upon the life of the solitary Boy? Other books would have taught him Glory in the place of Duty — the life of Alexander the Great would have learned him the blessing of wholesale murder — the history of Oliver Cromwell might have taught him the right to destroy one form of oppression by another form as galling. But the old Book had a different lesson. From the shadows of dead centuries it spoke to the heart of that Boy. Its words took shape, and rose before him, even from the tombs of long buried ages. And its lesson was simply — it is right to battle in the cause of freedom, because God has given the earth and its fruits to all his children — All. Yet never, even in warring for the right, forget that perfect freedom is only found in perfect love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEGEND FIFTH. THE CHALLENGE. One evening in the fall of 1754, three gentlemen were seated in a quiet room of an Inn, talking with each other with evident earnestness, on a subject of much importance. It was a comfortable chamber, with carefully sanded floor, high-backed oaken chairs, and a side-board, or beaufet, covered with decanters and glasses. The centre of the room was occupied by a large table, on which a lighted candle appeared, with a pair of pistols on one side, a sheet of paper, pens and an ink-stand on the other. And while the light of the candle fell over the animated faces of the three gentlemen, and the slight fire burning on the hearth imbued the atmosphere with comfortable warmth, they maintained their conversation with energetic gestures, yet in a subdued and whispering tone. The eldest of the three, a grim old man, with bald head, and grey whiskers on his bronzed cheek, was clad in a scarlet uniform. His form was rather portly: the expression of his grey eyes full of settled spleen; the very wrinkles about his compressed lips, indicated a hasty and irascible temper. The others, when they spoke to him, called him “Captain,” for, some years before, he had served in the regular force of the British Army, and although he had long resigned his commission, the odor of his dignity, as well as the glitter of the uniform, clung around him still. He sat at the head of the table, resting his hand upon the sheet of letter paper on which he was writing, and writing a challenge for a Ducl. The second of the party, a tall man, with fair complexion, yet firm and regular features, was clad in the costume of a planter; he sat in an arm chair, calmly smoking a cigar, and now and then adding a word, which was to the con versation like a spark to a keg of gunpowder. He was called “'Squire.” The third, a slender young man, almost effeminate in his appearance, and attired in a close-fitting British uniform, sat at the foot of the table, his delicate hands laid upon the pistols. They were intended for the anticipated duel. The eyes of this young man, large, dark, and intensely brilliant, illumined a pale, thoughtful face, and his mouth was impressed with a smile, which had as much of scorn as of mirth for its meaning. He was known by the others as “the Ensign.” And these three men, by the light of a wax candle, cheered by the kindly warmth of a wood fire, had secluded themselves in the Inn-room, in the early hours of an autumnal evening, in order to plan a deadly combat, and prepare the way over which two living men might journey speedily to their coffins and the grave-yard. It was, in fact, a Council of War. Let us listen to the “Ensign,” while he explains the cause of the duel; there is music in his delicately modulated voice: “This day, gentlemen, our town was the scene of the greatest excitement. An election was held for a member of Assembly: of course there was a great crowd, and a vast deal of hard talking and hard swearing. The excitement was no means diminished by the presence of a regiment of soldiers, who now make their quarters in the town. I have the honor to hold the commission of “Ensign” in that regiment, gentlemen, as you well know. The colonel is idolized by his men, although he is, like myself, only a boy of twenty-two. You know the history of his campaign in the West, among the French and Indians. What Virginian does not know it by heart? And this Colonel, idolized by his men, loved by every Virginian heart, was this day, in the presence of hundreds — yes, in the court-yard of Alexandria — levelled to the earth by a blow from a club!” The Ensign lifted the pistols, and glanced into the faces of his friends, as if to note the effect of his words. “Saw it myself,” said the 'Squire, speaking between puffs of smoke. “Colonel was struck to the earth, by a man not five feet high; Colonel is six feet three inches. Dispute about the election merits of the different candidates. Colonel gave Payne the lie! and Payne seized a club and let him have it. Sum total of the whole matter — the lie and the blow have passed, and they must fight.” The 'Squire knocked the ashes from his cigar. “I have written the challenge,” gruffly exclaimed the Captain, looking round with an emphatic grimace. “Ensign, will you act as the Colonel's friend, or shall I? As pretty a little affair as I ever saw. They can take a little bit of green meadow, by daylight to-morrow, and fire a couple of rounds, and settle the matter like — gentlemen.” And the worthy Captain confirmed his sentiment with an oath of remarkable emphasis. “They must fight, said the 'Squire, “as Virginians!” “The Colonel will be forever disgraced as a soldier unless he shoots this Payne,” said the Ensign, in his mild voice. “Zounds gentlemen, a blow! D'ye hear me, a blow with a club —” began the Captain. “In the open court-yard, too, in the presence of hundreds,” interrupted the 'Squire. “The very soldiers would have massacred Payne, if the Colonel had not interfered,” said the Ensign, joining in the chorus. “Certainly it is the most aggravated case that ever came to my notice.” It was an aggravated case. The Colonel, a gallant youth of twenty-two, who had done brave service in the wilderness, to be degraded by a blow, and not only covered with insult, but struck to the very earth, at the feet of his antagonist. It was galling. There was no other way of redressing the wrong, and wash ing out the insult, save in the blood of one or other, or both of the parties. And then — “I know the Colonel,” said the Ensign, still handling the pistols; “calm and resolved in the hour of battle, he is a man of impetuous temper; there is hot blood in his veins.” “He is in the next chamber,” whispered the 'Squire, “boiling over with a sense of the insult, no doubt. Do not speak loud. He will overhear us — it is not well to drive him to madness.” “And yet he must hear us,” — the portly Captain started from his chair, “and without delay. For, odds-blood, d'ye see, we must arrange the preliminaries.” He moved to the door of the next chamber, holding the written challenge in his hand. The Ensign followed, grasping the pistols, and the 'Squire came next with his — cigar. The Captain knocked — a pause — no answer. “He is mad with excitement, no doubt,” whispered the ex-officer, turning to his comrades with a sly leer, for he considered a duel as a capital joke, and the funeral which followed it, as a striking lesson for the young. He pushed open the door, and the party entered the room in which the Colonel sat alone — doubtless chafed to very madness by the memory of the wrong. A wax candle, burning on a table, revealed the furniture of a spacious chamber, and the figure of a gentleman, absorbed in writing. And while he wrote, with his hand gliding rapidly over the paper, he cast his eyes, very often, toward a miniature which lay near his hand. His back was turned toward the three; of course they could not see his face nor remark the agitation of his features. He did not hear the opening door, nor heed the sound of footsteps, but absorbed by his thoughts, continued writing. “Go forward, and tap him on the shoulder,” whispered the Colonel to the Ensign. The Ensign advanced on tip-toe, and gliding over the dark mahogany floor, raised his hand to place it on the Colonel's shoulder, when his eye was arrested by the miniature, and his uplifted hand dropped by his side. He sank backward, with a noiseless footstep, and whispered to the gruff Captain. “I cannot do it now. It is his mother's picture. He is writing to her —a last letter, may be.” The 'Squire now assumed the task, and said, “Good evening, Colonel!” in a loud, hearty voice. The Colonel rose, and greeted his visitors with a manner which combined all the grace and warmth of youth with the dignity of riper years. As he stood near the table, his form in all its majesty of stature, and his face with all its firmness of character, disclosed by the light, the three gentlemen could not but acknowledge that he presented a splendid mark for a — duelling pistol. The mark of the blow darkened his white forehead. His hair, nut brown in color, and without powder, fell in careless masses aside from his face. He was very pale; his eyes were bloodshot, and from his loosened cravat to his torn ruffles, everything about his attire, had a wild and disordered appearance. As he stood with one hand resting on the table, and the other extended toward his friends, they might recognize that blue uniform, which had been marked many a time by the bullet of the foe. “I have written a challenge, Colonel,” said the Captain, advancing. “He struck you down in the presence of hundreds”—and the Ensign drew near. “As a Virginian you must fight;”—the Planter also advanced. “Gentlemen —my friends —” said the Colonel, in a voice which was tremulous with emotion, “you say very justly to me, `you must fight.' This is the law of the code of honor; is it not? Well: I will meet Mr. Payne. I have made my preparations. I have just written a letter to my mother, in which I inform her that to-morrow morning I will go out into a meadow, and let Mr. Payne shoot me through the heart. That is right — is it not?” “But you forget, my dear Colonel, that you are decidedly the best shot of the two. And as for the sword, Payne cannot come near you. You will shoot Payne, my dear Colonel, and there the matter will end.” The Ensign uttered these words in his mildest voice, and with the most gentlemanly bow in the world. “Yes, it is true the matter will end there,” said the Colonel, as he saw his friends encircle him, “unless, indeed, some day or other I should happen to meet a wife, or a mother, or even a sister and hear words like those whispered in my ear —`Murderer! I demand my child! or my `brother!' or yet my `husband!' This, you will confess, would be very unpleasant.” The three friends were silent. The Planter lit the end of his cigar. The Ensign examined the mountings of the pistols. The Captain began to be very much interested in the words of the written challenge. And the Colonel, looking from face to face, awaited an answer. “So you all see, my good friends, that if there is to be a corpse” —he paused, and the three friends began to feel uneasy —“a corpse in this affair, I would much rather be that corpse myself, than to have the weight of a murder on my soul.” “But the insult —it was galling,” cried the Ensign, his face flushed and his eye brightening. “It was indeed galling,” said the Colonel, “but the provocation?” “You gave him the lie! and you were right, by —!” said the Captain, in his deepest bass. “Let us understand the question fully,” resumed the Colonel, in that deep tone, and with that steady glance which exercised an irresistible influence over his friends. “I am six feet three inches in height. You all acknowledge that I possess great personal strength. Mr. Payne, on the contrary, is neither remarkable for his stature nor for his physical power. And I —in the presence of my soldiers and my friends, call Mr. Payne by the most opprobrious word known in our language. Was I right, or was I wrong, my friends? Which do you most admire, gentlemen, my gallantry in thus insulting Mr. Payne, or the courage of Mr. Payne in knocking me down —by an unexpected blow, it is true — but in the presence of my soldiers and my friends?” A deep pause followed these words. “Zounds! If I can comprehend you, Colonel,” cried the Captain. “Am I to shoot Mr. Payne because I insulted him?” asked the Colonel!—“or, am I to shoot him because he was too brave to bear my insult? These are questions which I would like settled before I kill him, gentlemen.” And the Colonel turned away —looked forth from the window upon the star-lit sky —while his three friends gazed wonderingly in each other's faces. The Colonel remained by the window for at least five minutes, gazing upon the sky, while the mark of the blow darkened over his forehead. His thoughts may have been dark, bitter —but while he stood there, his three friends remained near the table, looking into one another's faces, but without speaking a word. “If you were in my place, Ensign, what would you do?” asked the Colonel, as he came toward the light again. “I would sooner be tied to a tree, among the Indians, with their scalping knives flashing before my face, than to bear that blow!” said the Ensign, with a gleaming eye. “And I would sooner lead off ten forlorn hopes, old as I am, than to avoid one challenge, or skulk one duel!” The old soldier pulled his whiskers with needless violence, and stamped his foot upon the floor until the chamber shook again. “And as for me, I'm neither a young nor an old soldier, but as a Virginian, sooner than bear that blow, I would blow my brains out with one of these pistols.” The Colonel lowered his head —his face was shadowed by thought. “Wherefore, gentlemen?” he asked, in a changed voice, as he shaded his eyes with his hand. “Because, to refuse to fight, in a case like this, is to wear the name of a —COWARD.” “And you have not the courage to wear the name of coward?” exclaimed the Colonel, still shading his face —“Yes, gentlemen,” — and he raised his face, no longer gloomy and pale, but flushed and smiling —“by your own confession, the courage manifested in dying at an Indian stake, or in perishing in a forlorn hope, or in blowing one's brains out with a suicide's pistol, is nothing —absolutely nothing —compared with that kind of courage which enables a man to face the name of coward, aye, and wear it too!” The young Colonel was magnificent in battle —stately in the ball room —glorious on his war horse —but now, as he pronounced these words, with a flushed cheek, brilliant eye, and clear deep voice, his three friends acknowledged in their whispers that although his ideas were “deuced bad,” his appearance, his manner, was imposing beyond all power of words. The countenance of the three friends, however, were clouded. “My dear fellow,” and the pale Ensign laid his hand upon the arm of his friend; “I have fought by your side. You know me. These things abstractly considered, mark you, are precisely as you say. But come to the practical view of the matter. There is not a young man in Virginia with prospects like yours. You will soon be called upon to lead your regiment against the common enemy, to wit, the allied bands of French and Indians. But you cannot go out to battle for your country with a dishonored name. You have been disgraced by a blow — disgraced, mark you. You must wash out your disgrace in blood.” The Ensign spoke with feeling. His companions murmured assent. The brow of the Colonel grew cloudy; his eyes brightened with a deadly fire. “There must be a duel,” he said with something like scorn or vengeance on his lip. “Gentlemen will you excuse me for half an hour? I myself will write the challenge.” The three friends retired from the room, and the Colonel was left alone. Alone, with the fatal mark upon his forehead, the insult rankling in his heart, and the — face of his widowed mother before his eyes. We dare not describe the emotions of that half hour. When it passed, he came forth, and stood on the threshold, holding a billet in his right hand. The three friends started to their feet, with one movement of surprise. The Colonel stood before them, not in military array, but in festival costume; his hair carefully powdered, his dark attire relieved by a white cravat and white waistcoat, snow-white ruffles about his hands, and neat diamond buckles on his shoes. By his side he wore a plain dress sword. But his powdered hair and white cravat, while they threw his remarkable features into bold relief, and by contrast, gave a deeper bloom to his cheek, a clearer light to his eyes, only made the mark on his forehead more dark and palpable. “Which of you will hear this challenge to Mr. Payne?” The three friends answered as with one voice — “I will — and I — and I!” “In my room — at an early hour — tomorrow!” said the Colonel, very calmly, but with a singular emphasis upon the words. “You understand, gentlemen?” He handed the challenge to the Ensign. “In your room” — began the portly Captain. “In my room, my good friend — for especial reasons,” answered the young officer, “and hark ye, Captain! Let as many of our mutual friends, as were witnesses to the insult be present, at the hour of seven, you will remember?” “That's it, my boy,” cried the bluff Captain. “Now you begin to talk!” But the Ensign did not like the strange calmness of the Colonel's face, nor did the Planter know how to construe his festival attire. “You are not in uniform, Colonel,” he whispered. “Oh, no!” and the Colonel glanced at his attire; “you remember there is a ball this evening. I must be present. There will be many of our fair ladies and a goodly array of gentlemen, no doubt. On no account would I be absent from the ball”— “Yet you may have some little affairs to arrange,” hinted the Ensign —“before a duel, Colonel, there are letters to write, and you will need some sleep”— The Colonel took his brother officer by the hand and looked intently into his eyes — “Harry! Do you think a man who has resolved to commit murder by the morrow's light, can pass the night before the deed, in writing letters, or in wholesome slumber, cheered by pleasant dreams? No! If I must murder, or be murdered to-morrow morning, for the sake of Honor, I will pass this night in the dance — among beautiful ladies — and groups of friends. We will have gaiety — dance — song! Come, my friends — who's for the ball?” And the gallant Colonel led forth his friends to the festival of that night — all save the Ensign, who went to bear the challenge. And whether the beautiful women of Virginia flouted in the dance, or strains of merry music awoke the echoes of the lighted hall, or groups of admirers clustered round some fair one, pre-eminent for her loveliness — still, amid every form of gaiety, the Colonel was the most prominent; the first, the liveliest and the handsomest of all the men who were gathered there. And all the while as a King might bear his crown, or a victor his laurels, the Colonel bore the livid marks upon his forehead. And the dancers who saw him, so gallant and so gay — shuddered when they saw the wound of the fatal blow upon his forehead — and many a fair daughter of Virginia whis pered, with accents of undisguised terror, the words — “To-morrow! * * * The Duel!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEGEND SIXTH. THE DUEL: OR, COURAGE THAT IS NOT AFRAID OF THE NAME OF “COWARD.” The morrow came. The room of the Colonel in the Inn of Alexandria, was the theatre of a remarkable scene. Through the uncurtained windows came the light of the early dawn, and there you might behold a glimpse of a river, glimmering faintly in the ray of a fading star. Silence reigned through the chamber — silence and gloom — although some twenty persons were assembled there. In one corner stood the bed, with unruffled coverlet; in the centre was the table, and around were seated the gentlemen who had been summoned as witnesses of the approaching Duel. These gentlemen — some of whom were officers in the Colonel's regiment, others planters of broad lands and immense fortunes — sat in silence, gazing with folded arms upon the table which stood in the centre, or though the gloom into each others' faces. The bluff Captain was there, but he had forgotten all his apt sayings about Honor and Chivalry; near him the Ensign, whose pale face, paler in fact than ever, indicated a night of anxious thought, and then our friend the Planter, who although the hour was early, and he had not yet broken his fast, still pressed a cigar between his lips, and hid his face in a curtain of smoke. The Colonel and the challenged man alone were absent. As for the Colonel, he was in the next room, attending to his letters, and — perchance — to his last will and testament. The first ray of sunrise shot through the window and trembled upon the vacant table. As if that beam, breaking in upon the gloom, had unloosened their hearts and tongues, the gentlemen began to whisper with each other. One spoke of the sad and fatal necessity of Murder involved in the Code of Honor — another of the widows and orphans who had been made by that blessed code — a third of the efficacy of a sword thrust, in healing broken hearts, or of the short and easy method of patching up “self-respect” by a — pistol shot. Some spoke of the character of the young Colonel, who, but twenty-two years old, might be cold and stiff before an hour was gone. And others of his antagonist — of the virtues which bound him to the hearts of many dear friends — of the ties which held him fast to life. Before an hour, very possibly, that antagonist would be a — corpse. Our friend, the bluff Captain closed all argument by the emphatic — “The Colonel's been struck and he must fight!” The Planter said nothing, but smoked his cigar; maybe he was thinking of his home, and calling to mind the Mother who might hear of the Colonel's death, ere the day was two hours older. As for the Ensign, he had nothing to say. It was his part to see that the weapons of murder were fairly prepared, and that the murder itself was done according to rule. That was all he had to do with the matter. And he waited for the hour of the performance with commendable impatience. At last the Ensign pulled out his watch, and announced the hour of — “Seven!” There was a general movement, and at the same moment the two doors of the chamber were suddenly opened. Through the door opening into the hall, came a very tall, slim gentleman with a pistol-case under his arm. “The second of Mr. Payne!” burst from twenty tongues And this tall slim gentleman, with the pistol-case under his arm, was followed by a gentleman whose short and stout form — well knit withal — and not unpleasing features, indicated the antagonist of the Colonel, Mr. Payne himself, who yesterday levelled the popular favorite in the dust. The second bowed and laid his pistol-case on the table; Mr. Payne bowed and folded his arms. His courage was unquestioned, but his face was impressed with an expression of seriousness — maybe — gloom. “The Colonel is good with the rifle, good with the pistol, good with the small sword!” So the whisper ran round the room. “And he'll wing his man,” rather rudely whispered the Captain. The Ensign rose, bowed twice, once to Mr. Payne, then to the second, and then in low tones, began to confer with the second upon the arms to be used, and the form to be observed in the approaching duel. Their whispers alone broke the breathless stillness. With rifle or with sword, or with pistol? Here in this room, or in the open air? Shall a fallen 'kerchief be the signal for them to begin? How many thrusts, how many shots, how much blood before “satisfaction” is given? Such was the hurried conversation of the “seconds,” conducted in animated whispers, now with a bow and again with a smile. The politest man in the world is the “second” of a duel. Meanwhile Mr. Payne stood alone — his arms folded — his eyes now fixed on the mantel-piece, now wandering to the window. Perchance he felt that his position was rather awkward; or thought how cheerful the sunshine looked, and how gloomy it would seem, if in an hour or more, those beams would light up the cold face of a corpse — or the cold faces of two corpses. Mr. Payne awaited with great impatience for the end of the second's conversation, and for the coming of — his antagonist. We have forgotten the opening of the other door. Through that door the Colonel came, at the very moment that Mr. Payne and his friend strode through the other. He remained for a moment concealed by the shadow of the bed, and then stepped suddenly into view, before the very eyes of Mr. Payne. That gentleman started back with involuntary surprise, as he caught first, a glimpse of his antagonist's shadow, and then a full view of that antagonist himself. A murmur swelled through the apartment, at the contrast presented by the personal appearance of Mr. Payne, as compared with the tall and imposing figure of the Virginia Colonel. Not that Mr. Payne was at all an unhandsome man, nor that his firm features lack expression, but the Colonel was a man whom you would remark not only for the majesty of his stature, but for the expression of his face, among a crowd of ten thousand men. And a burning blush overspread Mr. Payne's face, as he saw his antagonist standing before him, looking into his face — wearing the very uniform which he had worn yesterday — bearing upon his brow the livid scar of that fatal insult. But Mr. Payne had no time for thought. “We have arranged the preliminaries,” exclaimed the seconds, turning suddenly round, and starting with surprise as they beheld their principals standing face to face. Again Mr. Payne blushed as he saw the eye of the Colonel fixed upon him, and then folding his arms, he knit his brow and gazed sternly into his antagonist's face. The gentlemen present rose with one movement. You might have heard the beating of your own heart, all was so breathlessly still. Not a spectator but anticipated a personal conflict. “Mr. Payne,” the Colonel began. Mr. Payne retreated a step, still folding his arms. “Yesterday I called you `Liar!”' “You did,” cried Payne, with a flush of anger. “And —” “You levelled me to the ground,” continued the Colonel. “Behold the mark of your blow!” He paused — the silence deepened. The Colonel's voice and look were calm, but firm; Payne's face was flushed; his eye indignant. “And now, sir, I have a word to say to you,” continued the Colonel, still calm and firm. “And first let me ask a question. Is it manly — is it Christian, to attempt to justify a wrong by a murder? Or, is it more generous, more just, to confess a wrong with frankness, and solicit forgiveness from the injured? Yesterday I applied an unjust and ungentlemanly epithet to you — you promptly avenged yourself — are you satisfied? Here's my hand — let us be friends!” Long before the words had passed from the Colonel's mouth — long before the spectators recovered from their stupefaction — Payne had flung both hands toward his antagonist. The tears were streaming from his eyes. The seconds recoiled — the audience had no speech; they could only stand and look. Then the Colonel, with the mark on his forehead, led Mr. Payne toward the table. A decanter stood there, with two glasses. “Gentlemen,” said the Colonel, filling a glass and handing it to Payne, and then raising one to his own lips —“I give you the health of my good friend, Mr. Payne.” They emptied their glasses with one impulse. “And now, gentlemen, allow me to hope, that when, in after time, you recall the various personal combats which you have witnessed, you will remember with something like admiration the Duel of Mr. Payne and his enemy, George Washington!” Was there one man in that assemblage who could have called young Washington, Coward? And it was because he had “courage enough to bear the name of Coward,” that he became the man of counsel and of Battle — the Deliverer of a Country — the President of a free People — his name the watchword of all time. For a moment let us glance upon a far different scene, which took place after the Revolution. There is the blush of dawn upon the Hudson. In a glade, shaded by rocks overgrown with vines, and canopied by a glimpse of blue sky, two men stand ready for the Duel. In other words, they have come here, in the silence of the morning time, to do Murder, in accordance with the rules of Honor. Both of the same age — the very prime of mature manhood — renowned alike in the history of their country — they stand apart, while the “seconds” load the pistols and measure the ground. One attracts your attention with his great forehead, indented between the brows, and swelling with the sublime proportions of a great soul. That is Alexander Hamilton. The other wins your gaze, not only by his forehead, but by the indescribable, almost supernatural fascination of his eyes. That is Aaron Burr. They have been together in the Revolution, in the tent of Washington,— amid the perils of battle, — among the wintry hills of Valley Forge. Both great intellects, renowned alike for eloquence and courage; they have come here, to steal side-long glances at each other for a little while — and then stand back to back, and, at a word, wheel and murder. Burr challenges Hamilton, but Hamilton, unlike Washington, has not the “Courage to bear the name of Coward.” Hamilton, convinced, as any man in his senses must be, that the law of Duel is simply a law of Murder, accepts the challenge, and flings his life away like Abner of old. Gaze upon the cold face of Alexander Hamilton — behold Aaron Burr shrink shudderingly away from the corpse — and then contrast the conduct of Hamilton and Burr, the one accepting the challenge tendered by the other — with the sublime courage of Washington —“a Courage which was not afraid of the name of Coward.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEGEND SEVENTH. THE HUNTER OF THE ALLEGHANIES. Ninety-three years ago — from the ninth of July, 1848 — a man of almost giant stature, clad in the garb of a hunter, emerged from the shadows of a western forest, and stood in the sunlight, upon the summit of a rock, which overhung the waves of a wood-embosomed river. It was a calm day in summer. There was no cloud in the sky; no shadow on the waves. The air whispered in subdued murmurs through the leaves of the colossal trees, and the river, flashing in the sun, rolled through the solitude with wild flowers scattered upon its bosom. And the hunter, a man of gaunt form, and sunburnt face, seamed with scars, rested his arms upon his rifle, and surveyed the scene with a quiet delight. Standing thus alone, amid the silence and verdure of the green forest, he looked like an impersonation of those rugged pioneers of the white race, who combine the craft of civilization, with the costume and manners of the red men. The scene was marked by peculiar features. Gazing up the river, the hunter beheld on one side the sombre verdure of a trackless forest, advancing to the very brink of the waters; on the other a level plain — bordered by woods — succeeded by a sloping hill, with depth of woods beyond, rising boldly into the summer sky. There were dismal ravines among those woods — paths of difficulty and danger, beside that river; and the hunter clutched his rifle, while a grim smile crossed his scarred features as the thought of his Indian foes flashed over his brain. Still, clad in his garb of skins, with a hunting shirt worn over all, and girt by a leathern belt to his waist, this man of the wilderness, whose delight it was to track the wild beast to its lair, or follow the Indian on his way of death, leaned upon his rifle, while his sunken eyes began to flash and brighten in his sunburnt face. It was high noon. The silence of the wilderness was unbroken by a sound. Here waved the forest leaves, gorgeous with the drapery of summer; there flashed the river, bearing stray flowers upon its tremulous bosom; yonder, on the northern shore, extended the plain, with the hill rising gently toward the distant wood. In fact, the river and the plain, and sloping hill, embosomed among woods, smiled in the noonday sun, without one floating cloud to shadow their beauty, or dim the tranquil azure of the summer sky. While the hunter stood on the projecting rock, drinking the silence and the fragrance of the untrodden wild, a change came suddenly over the scene. The blast of a war trumpet was borne upon the air; a war banner fluttered in glimpses on the sight. That trumpet was the voice of an army; that banner waved over the heads of twelve hundred men in battle array. It was a very beautiful sight to see, as emerging from the shadows, they came along the southern bank of the river, with the great forest on one hand, and the river, rolling and flashing on the other. Banners were waving there, and drum answered to trumpet, as they came, and the tread of twelve hundred men awoke the echoes of the woody glen. There were British soldiers with their scarlet coats glaring, and their burnished arms flashing in the sun; there was the pride of the Virginian chivalry, clad in huntsman attire; and there, riding leisurely along, upon a snow-white steed, came the general of the host, upon whose word hung twelve hundred lives. He was a man of commanding presence, with a golden-hilted sword by his side, and a laced chapeau upon his forehead. A scarlet coat, adorned with gold lace, displayed the strength and elegance of his warrior form; his florid face, stamped with an abiding complacency, was ruffled with a smile. Around him rode a band of gallant men, the officers of his staff, arrayed, like their General, in scarlet and tinsel. Only one in that band was attired in different costume; only one did not mingle in the laughter, or take part in the careless conversation. He was a youth of twenty-three years, and his pale cheek bore traces of sickness. Over his blue uniform a hunting shirt was thrown, but it did not conceal the noble outline of his tall form, nor altogether hide the proportions of his manly chest. Mounted upon a dark bay horse, he rode forward in silence, his grey eyes flashing from his pale face with steady light. On this side the woods — yonder the river — around him the glitter of tinsel and the waving of plumes, and the youth of twenty-three years laid one hand absently upon the flowing mane of his steed, while the other rested upon the hilt of his sword. His thoughts were far away — his absent eye and pale cheek contrasted strongly with the laughing faces which encircled him. The General and his Staff were thinking gay thoughts and talking pleasant words in that quiet summer hour. The youth of twenty-three was the only silent one in the band. Unsheathing his gold-hilted sword, the General pointed to the opposite shore, where the level plain, embosomed among woods, rose into a gently sloping hill, backed by a sombre forest and a smiling sky: “Before sunset, Fort Duquesne is ours,” he said, with a smile. “Our men will cross the river at this ford, ascend yonder hill, and traverse ten miles of forest road, which lie between us and the fort, ere the setting of the sun. The banner of his Majesty will wave over the conquered fort before the day is gone.” The gallant men who rode near their General chorussed his words, and amid the tramp of that legion of armed men, the roll of drum and the peal of trumpet, you might have heard their exclamations — “Before sunset, the flag will wave over the conquered fort!” The youth of twenty-three did not mingle in the chorus. He cast his glance toward the opposite shore — toward those magnificent woods, whose depths embosomed dismal ravines — toward the far-off hill-top, which was separated from Fort Duquesne by a wilderness of ten miles; and his lip was compressed, his cheek grew paler, his eye gathered new fire. Only the night before he had started from the sick couch and mounted his war horse. Perchance the fever still lingered in his veins; but his face was shrouded in sadness — his heart was shadowed by a vague but overwhelming foreboding. The General turned to him with a laugh — “Colonel, you are gloomy to-day,” he said. “But then you have just risen from a sick couch, and the road is rough and fatiguing. In a little while, however, the danger and the peril will be over. To-night we will sleep in Fort Duquesne, and drink a bumper to the health of our King.” The young man urged his horse nearer to the General's side. “General,” he said, bending toward him, and speaking in a whisper, “there are dangerous coverts on yonder shore — fatal ravines in the depths of yonder woods. Let me take a band of picked men, and beat the covert and explore the ravines, before the whole body of our men cross the river.” There was an inexpressible earnestness in his voice — a steady light in his grey eye. The General uttered an ejaculation of impatience: “There is no danger,” he exclaimed, assuming all the dignity of a General in the regular service. “To-night we will sleep in Fort Duquesne.” The young man did not reply; and while the bugle answered to the drum, and the solemn grandeur of the forest was contrasted by the flashing of the waters, General Braddock and Colonel Washington rode side by side on the border of the Monongahela. Twelve hundred men, some clad in scarlet, others in blue — some lifting their glittering bayonets into light — others girding their tried rifles in sinewy arms, were marching there, with their General in their midst, and the sad eye of George Washington glancing from line to line. And the same breeze which fanned the pale cheek of the young soldier, lifted the great banner of England into light, and tossed its gay emblazonry over plumes and bayonets of the armed men. It was a sight, mingling grandeur and beauty, to see these soldiers emerge from the solemn shadows, and take their way along the river's verge; but as the glittering array, parting into three divisions, prepared to ford the river, while the bugles rang with merrier peals, the scene assumed a deeper interest, a stranger and wilder grandeur. Braddock, reining his white horse near the shore, saw the first division, of three hundred men, march into the waves in exact order, while the banner fluttered in their van. The face of the brave General was clad in smiles; his voice, heard in repeated commands, was gay and boisterous. And as the bayonets of the first division glittered near the northern shore, the second division, two hundred strong, left the southern shore, with the roll of drum and the clang of trumpet. Beautiful it was to see their burnished arms, reflecting the blaze of noonday, and firing the tremulous waves with masses of dazzling light. And as the General saw the first division ascend the opposite bank, the second fording the river; he himself led on the third, — the main body of his brave army, — and while his white horse bent down to slake his thirst in the cool waves, he beheld the artillery and the baggage train, slowly urging onward, while the thoughtful young soldier, rode in silence at his side. There was no smile upon the face of young Washington. True, the sky was smiling beyond the opposite woods, but dismal ravines were hidden beneath those groups of foliage; deathly coverts lurked beneath those bowers of summer verdure. And yet it was a magnificent thing to see this brave band parting into three divisions — one flashing on yonder plain, the second emerging from the waves, and the third toiling, on in mid-stream —while from each division trumpet answered trumpet, and the clattering of arms, the tread of regular columns, the neighing of war steeds, gave omen of a day of glory, to be followed by a night of victorious repose. The grim hunter who stood upon the rocks beheld it all. Saw the first division ascend the hill, the second emerge upon the opposite shore, and the third in the midst of the waters, and then the animated face of Braddock, side by side with the pale visage of Washington, for a moment enchained his gaze. He left the tree which had sheltered him; he descended from the rock, and drew near the shore. A solitary soldier, whose red coat shamed the hunter's grim array, lingered there, the last to cross the river, the last man of the army. His foot was in the water, when the hand of the hunter pressed his shoulder. “Drink, man, drink, from the river, before you cross,” cried the hunter to the astonished soldier, “For there's a warm day before you, and your next draught will be of blood.” And while the soldier, startled at the appearance of the gaunt backwoodsman, shrunk from his touch, the hunter clasped his rifle more firmly in his knotted fingers, and dashed through the river's waves. We will see him again, when the fight goes on most horribly under its pall of cloud; the rifle which he grasps is the fate of yonder gallant army. Meanwhile, Braddock, passing from the river to the shore, — his eye drinking in, with one quick glance, the blue sky, the encircling woods, and the hillside clad in scarlet and steel, — Braddock we say, the General of the army, who had been trained to war on the parade ground of Hyde Park, turned with a smile to the young Virginian who rode near his side. “The sky is clear, Colonel, — to-night we sleep in Fort Duquesne!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEGEND EIGHTH. THE BATTLE OF MONONGAHELA. “General,” said young Washington, with an earnestness in his tone that would have penetrated any heart, not stultified by self-conceit, “with twelve men, I will traverse yonder thickets, and defend our army from a fatal surprise.” The young soldier as he spoke bent over the neck of his bay steed, and his pale face, shadowed in the forehead by his hat, was touched in the cheeks by the noon-day sun. Braddock smiled — And at the moment, a column of smoke, rose from the hill-side into the sky — there was a sound as of one column of armed men recoiling on another — from every side pealed the rifle-shot mingled with that war-cry which makes the blood sun cold even in a veteran's veins. The smile passed from Braddock's face. Casting his gaze toward the hill-top, he beheld his first division half lost to view amid clouds and flame. He saw a sheeted blaze pouring from the shadows of the trees. He heard the cry which pealed from the wood, from the ravine — echoing, thrilling, from every side into the calm Heaven. “The Indians and the French are upon us!” he cried, turning his flushed face toward young Washington. At the same moment, the white plume which crowned his chapeau was borne away by a rifle shot. “General,” cried Washington, “there is but one way to save our army from defeat and massacre. Let our men fight under shelter, and then every rock will be a fort, every tree a castle —” With a sneer on his colorless lip, the General turned away. “That is not the way for an Englishman to fight,” he said. But as he spoke, the first division came rushing in wild disorder from the top of the hill — soon its panic-stricken soldiers communicated their panic to the second — and from the second to the third, like lightning from one cloud to another, that panic leapt, until amid the clouds which rushed over the scene, nothing was seen but broken ranks, falling back before a deadly fire. How the voice of the battle awoke the wilderness, and filled every nook of the forest with the groans of dying men! Dying afar from country and from home, not in open fight, or by a foe, whose eyes flashed in their faces as his arm fell in the death-blow, but by the hand of an enemy who crouched in the thicket, and murdered securely from the shadow of a rock. Behold the scene. This band of twelve hundred men, scattered over the hill-side, are shut in by a wall of fire. They advance and they are dead. They retreat, and their path is choked by corpses, which a moment since were living men. They move to his side, and death flashes upon them from yonder log. On to the other, and they are mown to pieces by the fire from those collosal oaks. And Braddock, hoarse with shouting and blind with rage, sends the gallant men of his staff whirling over the field. “Let them form in regular order. Let them fight like Englishmen, and the day is ours.” And to his side there comes a wounded horse, bearing the young Virginian, whose hunting shirt, is torn into ribbons by the bullets of the foe. “General,” he cries, “it is not yet too late. Let our men fight the enemy in their own way — let them fight behind cover — and the day is ours.” The words have not passed his lips, when his horse reels under him, and sprinkles the sod with blood. Then young Washington starting from his dying horse, springs to his feet, and awaits the answer of Braddock, his pale face now flushing fast with the fever of battle. An oath escapes the lips of the Briton. “No, sir. The men shall fight as Englishmen or not at all!” he shouts, and dashes to another part of the field. Half-way down the hill-side, encircled by the sudden clouds of battle, the young Virginian stood, one foot resting upon the flank of his dying steed, whose glassy eye was once upturned toward his master's face, and then cold and dark forever. His cheek was no longer pale — flushed with the impulse of the fight, it gave a deeper light to his eye, while his brow grew radiant with a sombre delight. It was in this moment, when the fire of the irresistible foe, hurled panic and death into the “exact” order of the British army, that young Washington lingered for a moment near his dead steed, and took in with an eager glance the confused details of the scene. Clouds of white smoke, tinged here and there with a midnight fold, rolled over the hill-side, and hung over the river, reaching from forest to forest, above the waters, like a bridge of death. Among these clouds, through the intervals made by the musquet flash or rifle blaze, the British host, no longer joined in compact lines, but broken into confused crowds, was visible. From the hill-top and from the ravines on either hand; nay, from every log and tree streamed the incessant blaze which strewed the sod with dead and dying. And the calm sky was choked by battle cloud — the awful stillness of the virgin forest was succeeded by the howl of demoniac carnage. This was the scene which Washington beheld as resting one foot upon the flank of his dead horse, he cast a hurried glance around him. Braddock was there — upon his horse, which panted and reared among heaps of dead — his voice came hoarsely down the hill as he en deavored to rally his men into parade order, and force them to fight this battle in “regular” style. Washington groaned in anguish. He had warned the General of the ambush — had besought him, almost with tears, to move forward with caution — and now, his warnings disregarded, his prayers met with scorn, he beheld twelve hundred men at the mercy of a hidden foe. “The day is not yet lost!” he cried, as a hope brightened over his face. “George!” said a gruff voice, and a hard hand was laid upon his own. The giant hunter,* * See Legend Seventh. clad in his costume of skins, half concealed by a hunting shirt, stood before him. The blood trickled over his sunburnt cheek, but he grasped his good rifle in one hand, while the other held the rein of a frightened and riderless horse. “George,” said the hunter, with gruff familiarity, “thou'rt the only man can save us today. Here's a horse, boy — mount him, and tell that fool of a Britisher, that we don't fight French and Ingins in this 'ere style. Tell him that we can fight 'em in their own way, but it is not our fashion to walk up to death and swallow it, in this fool-hardy manner.” Not a word more was spoken. With a bound Washington sprang into the saddle — you may see his form, yonder amid the mists of battle — you may trace the fiery circles of his sword above the lurid clouds. The hunter gazed after him with a grim smile, and then plunged into the smoke. Near the top of the hill, his face purpled by rage, Braddock mounted on a fresh horse — two had fallen under him — was hurrying his aids over the field, while the bullets whistled like hail over his head, and about the long mane of his war steed. “General!” cried Washington, as he dashed up to the side of the Briton — “once more let me beseech you — change the order of this conflict. It is folly, it is worse than folly, to attempt to combat a hidden enemy in this style. Let the Provincials, at least, fight behind cover” — In the very earnestness of the very moment he leaned forward, his hunting shirt falling back over his chest, and disclosing his blue uniform. And at the very instant a button was severed from his breast by a rifle ball. Braddock did not even listen to the young Virginian. Maddened by the terrible havoc going on every hand — inflated by the peculiar self-complacency which possesses mere military men, over all the world, he bade his aid-de-camp join with him in the attempt to rally the panic-stricken troops, to display them once more in regular lines, and march them “exactly” to death, according to the tactics of the regular army. But at the moment a scene occurred which paled even Braddock's cheek. A band of Virginians, some eighty men in all, fought their way up the hill-side, turned a fallen tree, whose huge trunk, some five feet in diameter, offered a convenient breast-work. From the thicket, beyond that tree, streamed the blaze of Indian rifles, and yet those men, led on by their Captain, the brave Waggoner, fought steadily up the hill-side, their blue hunting frocks seen distinctly amid the clouds which curled about the summit. Their way is littered with dead; they cannot advance but the corpse of a Briton, clad in scarlet, glares in their faces with stony eyes. Braddock saw them on their fearful way — Washington, too, reining his brown steed near the General's side, held his breath as he marked each step of their progress. The short sword of Waggoner gleaming in their van — the heroic Virginians dashed onward, and, leaving three of their number in their path, they reach the fallen tree — they are dealing death among the foemen hidden by yonder thicket, when — Braddock's cheek grew livid — Washington uttered a cry of despair! — When they are cut down, hewn into fragments, crushed into one mangled heap of living men, entangled among dead and dying. Crushed not by a fire from their front, but by a fire from the rear, mangled not by bullets of the foe, but by the rifles of their comrades — their brothers. Captain Waggoner rose up from among the heaps of dead, and shook his bloody knife in the air, in witness of the fatal mismanagement which had butchered thirty out of his eighty men. Washington saw that sword quivering and gleaming from the hill-top, and with a cold sneer on his face, turned to the regular general. “You see, General,” he said, “those of our men who mean to fight, are massacred by your regular soldiers!” Ere Braddock could reply, his horse sunk beneath him, pierced in the heart by a rifle bullet. He rises from the dying steed — he shouts for a fresh horse — he plunges madly to and fro in the thickest of the battle. Does he learn wisdom by experience, does he bid his men to maintain the fight behind the trunks of these colossal trees? No — no! Determined to enforce “regular tactics” and “correct discipline” to the last moment, he speeds wildly among his broken columns, never for a moment pausing in his career, save to insult some provincial band, who are holding battle from the shelter of fallen trees. There was a slender youth, clad in the hunting frock, who loaded his rifle behind a poplar tree which towered alone in the centre of the field. His young breast protected by this tree, he loaded in silence without even a battle shout, and then, with lips compressed and flashing eye, took his deadly aim, and saw his distant foeman reel into death. It was Braddock who marked this youth, and reined his horse near the tree, pulling the rein so suddenly, that the wild steed fell back on his haunches. “Coward!” cried he, turning his flushed face towards the boy, “you dare not fight like a man, but must skulk behind the shelter of a tree —” He leans over the neck of his steed; his sword descends — the boy sinks on his knees, and turns his disfigured face toward the British General. But Braddock was gone again. Urging his horse over the dying and the dead, he hurries to another part of the field, beholding everywhere the same spectacle — broken crowds of scarlet-coated soldiers, firing upon each other while the hidden foe hems them on every hand, and mows them incessantly into the great harvest of death. Meanwhile, the boy by the solitary poplar, beaten to the earth by Braddock's sword, wipes the blood from his eyes, and looks around with a vague glance. His senses are whirling in delirium; a word of home comes to his white lip, mingled with the syllables of a sister's name. But there is a giant form bending over him; a sunburnt face, streaked with blood, is gazing into his own with dilating eyes. It is the hunter, clad in a hunting shirt, spotted with blood, but with his good rifle in his brawny arm. His own arm becomes nerveless, his harsh voice faint and broken, as he bends over the bleeding boy. “Arthur,” he says, smoothing the brown locks of the boy aside from his bloody forehead — “who has done this? Tell me, child — tell me;” — an oath escaped from between his set teeth — “and if he's hidden behind a hundred yards of French and Ingins I'll pay him for it, afore this day's an hour older!” The boy passed one hand over his eyes, and wiped the blood away. “Brother,” he faintly said, and a smile of recognition passed his pale face — “It was a sword * * * * In Braddock's hand. * * * * You see, he did not like it, because I fought behind a tree.” The stern backwoodsman rose and clutched his rifle. The cords of his bared neck began to swell; a hoarse cry came from his heaving chest. And then, while his young brother lay bleeding at the foot of the poplar tree, the sunburnt man, with the great tears starting over his tawny cheeks, began to load his rifle in silence, but with much prudence and care. “That ball is for him, Arthur — I shan't fire this rifle until his heart lies afore it, and that's a sartin thing!” With these words he turned away, measuring the sod with immense strides. He had not gone ten paces, when a sudden thought came over him. “The boy will die,” he muttered, and turned away. He drew near, but no voice greeted him this time with the word “brother.” Where he had left a wounded form, bathed on the brow with streaming blood, now was only a corpse, propped against the tree, the rifle fallen from its stiffened fingers, and the cold lips parting in a smile. There was a stain upon his breast, near the heart — a stray bullet had completed the work begun by Braddock's sword. It would have moved your heart to see the rugged backwoodsman, gazing silently into the face of the dead boy. Few words he said, but they were spoken with a heaving heart and choking utterance. “Arthur, my child, you staid at home with the old folks in the settlements yonder, while your brother went out to seek his fortin' among b'ars and Ingins in the woods. A bold fellow I've been — many a rough fight I've had — but I don't want to see two days like this in a life time. This mornin', when I came to jine the army, I thought you was far away — safe at home — it's the first time I've seen your face for many a day. An' now they're waitin' for you, — father and mother, — and here you are, cut down like a dog, by Braddock's sword.” A gleam of battle light reddened the pale features of the dead boy. The giant hunter turned away, grasping the rifle which embodied the fate of the army, the destiny of Braddock. He turned away, and soon was lost among the clouds — after a while we will behold him again. For three hours the work of massacre went on. Five horses were shot beneath the British General as he hurried madly over the field, but all his efforts were vain. His artillery and infantry, mingled at first in sad disorder, were soon mingled in one common havoc. For three hours the blood shed on the hill-side trickled down through the grass, and fell drop by drop into the Monongahela. For three hours that girdle of flame shut in the doomed army, and when the third hour came, and the sun, as if weary of slaughter, veiled his beams in a lurid cloud, seven hundred men were stretched upon the sod. Seven hundred dead and dying, out of an army of twelve hundred men, slain in a combat of three hours, by a hidden foe! Sixty officers, brave and gallant; the flower of Virginian chivalry and the pride of the regular army, were stretched among the slain. And as the work of carnage goes on, where is Washington, the youth of twenty-three, whose grey eye, already fires with precocious experience? Many and thrilling are the traditions which the old soldiers of the field — the few survivors of its carnage — have handed from the history of their hearts down to our day. Mounted on a dark bay he had crossed the river, his pale cheek touched by a solitary flush, but his grey eyes full of indefinable foreboding. The bay horse had fallen dead beneath him in the dawn of the fight. Next, his commanding form, roused into all its vigor by the frenzy of battle, was borne over the field by a generous roan horse, whose eye dilated with the fury of the hour. And the generous roan had fallen, too, under his young rider, howling his last war cry as his broken limbs crumbled beneath him. But now, mounted upon a grey horse, his forehead bared to the battle flash, and his uniform riddled by bullet-holes, Washington is seen where the fire of the enemy illumines the verge of the ravine; where the Indian yell mocks the anguish of the dying — where the hill-top gleams like a funeral pyre, with bayonets and rifle blaze. Now confronting this havoc-stricken band of regulars, hurling his horse before them, and daring them to fly the field; now rallying yonder group of Continentals, and leading them to the hopeless charge; at one time, beside the infuriated Braddock, listening to his mad commands, at another, whirling like an arrow over the hill side, into the very vortex of battle. It was thus that the grey horse became known to friend and foe; it was amid the corses of Braddock's field beside the waters of the Monongahela, that the name of Washington was first stamped upon the hearts of his countrymen, to ripen into full glory upon a broader and holier field. And wherever the young Virginian went, whether skirting the borders of the wood, or riding in the centre of the fight, there was an eye that followed his career; there was a rifle levelled at his breast. So, Braddock, wherever he rode, saw through the mists of the scene, an eye watching his progress, a rifle levelled at his heart. There was this difference between the two. It was an Indian who tracked the steps of Washington, and hung like a red image of death in his path. Three times he had fired — he was the most fatal marksman in all his tribe — and yet his balls had glanced from the breast of Washington, like icicles from the granite rock. It was a gaunt form, almost gigantic in stature, that followed Braddock through the mazes of the scene. A backwoodsman, with a torn hunting frock, fluttering over his garment of skins. But never once had he fired. Many times had the rifle rose, and the aim been taken, but there was no report from the deadly tube. He seemed, this unknown man, to delay his fire, as an epicure pauses long, before he touches the richest viand of his feast. At last there come a moment — the bloodiest and the darkest of all — near the close of the third hour, when Washington reined his grey horse near Braddock's side. It was near the summit of the hill — they were encircled by corpses; wherever their eyes turned was the sight of a dying man, writhing in the last agony, or a dead man's face, upturned to the dark battle cloud. Braddock's jet black horse — it was the sixth he had bestrode on this fatal day — hung his head over the neck of Washington's grey steed, as the riders conversed in hurried and subdued tones. Braddock's gay uniform was sadly disfigured; his face, livid under the eyes, was stamped with a sullen despair. Washington's visage, boldly marked against the dark cloud — the forehead bare and the eye gleaming — was radiant with a glorious hope. “General, I can save the wreck of our force,” he said, in a pleading tone. “Permit me to do it.” At this moment, from a log, some few paces behind the back of Washington, rose the image of a gaunt backwoodsman, with levelled rifle, and sunburnt face, compressed by a deadly resolve. And from a rock, fifty yards from the back of Braddock, an Indian started into view, his rifle poised — his red plume waving over his visage — the death aim taken, and the finger on the trigger. Does the backwoodsman level his rifle at the heart of Washington? Does the Indian chief mean to slay the General in the gay scarlet uniform? No — no! Ten times the Indian has fired at the heart of Washington; four bullets have touched but not wounded him; six have left him scatheless. If the eleventh does not kill, the Indian will fire no more, assured that the Great Spirit panoplies the youth of twenty-three years. And as for the Backwoodsman, this is his first and last fire at the heart of Braddock. As he loaded that rifle near the body of the dead brother — he feels that its bullet is winged by death. And thus, the Indian behind Braddock, the Backwoodsman at the back of Washington, each take their fatal aim in the last hour of the fatal fight. “Permit me, General,” said the tremulous voice of Washington, “permit me to save the the wreck of our gallant band?” There was a lull in the storm. Suddenly, through the momentary stillness, two separate sounds, from opposite sides, pealed on the air like echo answering echo. Two rifle balls, winged by death, hissed on their way. One tore a fragment from the breast of Washington's coat, but left the young hero scatheless. Braddock smiled as he marked the trace of the bullet — and then fell on the neck of his horse with a low groan. A bullet had pierced his right arm, and buried itself in his heart. And the Indian chief fled into the thicket, telling his red brothers how the Great Spirit guarded the breast of the young man, mounted on the grey horse — how steel could not wound, nor bullet harm him — his heart was as granite, his arm as iron, and his name destined for great deeds in some future day. And the gaunt hunter went slowly to the foot of the poplar tree; and bent near the dead boy, and wiped the blood, still warm, from his cold features, saying, amid his anguish, two simple words — “My Brother!” And the young Virginian, mounted on the grey steed, rallied the wreck of the gallant army, and — while artillery and baggage were left, with the corpses of the slain, to the foe — saw them cross once more the river, whose waves now blushed as if in very shame for the carnage, and a rude tumbril rolled onward; bearing amid the broken columns the mangled form of Braddock, who, in the delirium of his wounds, kept ever repeating a single name — “Washington.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEGEND NINTH. WASHINGTON IN LOVE. There is a Legend which should never be told, save in the calm of the summer twilight, when the drops of the shower yet sparkle on the leaves, and the setting sun shines out from the west, while the east displays a rainbow on its clouds. Then when the glory of the rainbow, set upon the eastern cloud, seems to call to the declining sun, shining in great splendor, from the clouds that hang above his rays — when there are drops like diamonds on every leaf — when the air is fragrance — and one heavenlike glimpse of sunset and rainbow, looks in upon the world, ere the storm and blackness of night comes over us — then let us tell a strange Legend of the wild wood, in the days of old. And yet I am afraid to tell this Legend. It has lingered so long about my heart — been in my dreams so long — come to me like music that bursts over still waters through midnight stillness — that I am loth to write it down in words. Afraid that my pen cannot do justice to its simple pathos; that its joy and its tears, will find in my words no voice, worthy of their intensity and love. One summer evening when the sun was low, an old man sat in front of his cabin door. That cabin stood in a hollow or glen, which extended through the virgin forest from north to south, with a glimpse of blue sky at either extremity. It was a one-storied fabric, built of huge logs, and hidden under the boughs of the great trees. The roof, the timbers, everything but the rugged door, was hidden by boughs and vines. So that rugged door looked not so much like the entrance of a cabin, as a mass of rough boards, set in branches and leaves. Some gleams of fading sunlight came from the sky above — from either extremity of the glen — and spread a pool of light before the old man's door. Shut out from the world, three hundred miles at least from white civilization, hidden in this nook of the Alleghanies, this old man sat on the side of a fallen log, and with light playing around him — while the other part of the glen was in shadow — he seemed thinking of other days, of his youth, or of the graves of his People. It is no image of the imagination that I would paint to you. An actual old man, enduring, suffering — dying by inches — in the awful solitude of the forest, in the year 1754. A tall frame, gaunt and grim with age, and looking like a skeleton, encased in hunting shirt, leggins, and mocassins. A withered face, browned by wind and sun, with the sinews of the bared throat as prominent as cords, and the wrinkled forehead contrasted with scanty flakes of snow-white hair. His limbs crossed, his large hands laid on his knees, the old man gazes into the shadows of the forest, and seems like the Pilgrim of the old story, who sat him down one day, and waited patiently until Death came by. Upon the log which supports the old man, we behold a rifle, with stock of dark mahogany, and mountings of silver. It is much worn, indeed it has seen forty years of service. For this aged man, now sitting alone in the forest, presents to us a stern embodiment of that wondrous race of men, who penetrated the great forest of Pennsylvania, at least one hundred years in advance of their race, and made the Indian mode of life their own, gathering food with their rifles, and sometimes feeling a great consciousness of God's Presence, even in the midnight of the wilderness. But the hunter is old now, very old; ninety years are upon him with their snows. The hand that once was strong, is now weak as any child's. The foot that once scaled the mountain, and trod without fear, the verge of dizzy chasms, now trembles in the little journey from the log to the cabin door. And he will die alone in the wilderness! From no wilderness of Red Brick, will his soul escape to his God. But gloriously from the dead solitudes of the wilderness, that soul will leave the shattered frame — cold and stiff upon the log — and wing its way through the virgin air to Eternity. “Ninety years!” the old man murmurs — and is still again. It is a long time to contemplate; longer to feel like ice in your veins, and winter in your soul. And from the cabin-door, there steals on tip-toe a form, which by its very contrast, made the old age of the Hunter more deeply venerable. A young girl, clad in a coarse skirt which reaches to the knee, her limbs covered with leggings, her feet with mocassins. And yet you never saw a form at once so lithe and so blooming in its outlines — you never heard a step so gentle and yet so active — you never saw a brown face like hers, illumined by so pure a soul, or shadowed by chesnut hair so rich and flowing! She came behind the old man gently, and laid her hands upon his white hairs, and placed her smooth cheek against his withered face. It was like an embodied dream. The withered cheek beside the clear brown face of youth, the eyes dim with age, contrasted with eyes large, black and brilliant; while hair telling of ninety winters swept the chesnut curls which scarcely indicated nineteen summers. It was a touching sight — to see the old man clasp her hands within his own, while his uplifted eyes, brightened into life again, as he perused the wild beauty of her face. And as the evening hour deepened into night, they conversed together, the aged man, and the young maiden. Talked low and long of that strange life in the forest — of the books which cheered the lonely hours of the winter's night — of one Book which opened a path, even through the silence of eternal solitudes, from the lone heart to its God. Of the Hunters, rude men of the forest, who often came to the cabin door with stores of corn and venison — and now and then a garment or some luxury of civilized life — for the old Hunter and his grand-child, Marion. “But grandfather, you have often promised to tell me of my father and mother,” said the girl resting her hands upon his white hairs — and of the Home in which they dwelt, far away from the woods — near cities and gardens, such as we see described in books. I am but young, grandfather, — but you have passed many long years in the forest. Tell me, I beseech you, the story of your life, and of my own.” A shadow fell upon the old Hunter's face. “Lo, Marion,” he said abruptly — “there are histories my child, which should never be told, save as confessions, made by white lips, in the hour of death. Your father — your mother!” he shuddered, and shrunk away from her hands and cast his eyes to the sod. The girl stood silent and trembling, her bosom swelling beneath its coarse vestment; her large eyes full of light and tears. The sunshine tinting the mazes of her chesnut hair, fell strong and vivid, upon his agitated face. “You thrust me from you” — said Marion — “This is not well, grandfather. In all the world I have no friend but you.” He extended his withered hand. “Come hither” — his voice was tremulous and broken — “sit by my side. Seventeen years ago, I came to this place, and bore you in my arms — a babe whose eyes had hardly seen one year of life. I reared this cabin for you Marion — to you, and to your life, I devoted what remained of mine own. By day I hunted among the hills, while you remained alone within our cabin. And at night, beside our fire, we sat together — you learned to read — the great world of books was opened to your eyes. And before my sight you blossomed into life, until the old Hunter, would look into your face at times, and wonder whether you were not an Angel, sent by God, to cheer the gloom of his cabin, and with your Presence lighten up the lone forest glen.” The old man paused, and wiped the moisture from his eyes. “Ask me of this — of your own history — of the blessing you have been to me, in my hours of pain — and I will speak freely. But rather wish me dead at your feet — rather pray that the lightning may strike these gray hairs — than to ask me to relate the History of the Past. The Past! That awful shadow which rests upon my history, ere I brought you to the glen, seventeen years ago!” The old man rose abruptly, and with unsteady but hurried steps sought the cabin door. He disappeared beneath its shadow. The girl remained near the fallen log, her finger placed upon her moist red lip, her eyes, burthened with tears, cast to the earth. And while her bosom swelled with vague thoughts — thoughts strange and mingled in their hues — at once oppressive and lightened by gleams of joy — she strayed absently over the sward, toward the northern extremity of the glen. A wondrous life had been hers. Reared in the lone forest, the Great World had come to her, only as the memories of a half-forgotten dream. She had heard of a place, half a day's journey from the cabin, called Fort Duquesne; once, with her grandfather, she had visited “a settlement” far away in the woods, and seen for the first time in her life, the face of a white woman. Oftentime the red man had paused at the cabin door, but not with a thought of harm, for the old Hunter Abraham, dwelling thus alone, with this beautiful child — was sacred in his eyes — protected by the Great Spirit, who sends good angels to guard withered Age and brown-haired Orphanage. Even the backwoodsman, who mingled the vices of civilization and the hardy virtues of savage life, respected the Home of the old man, and looked upon the beautiful Orphan as a sacred thing. Thoughts and memories, like these, glided into the mind of Marion, as she wandered over the sward, toward the northern extremity of the glen. At last, she started back with affright — for she advanced to the brow of a crag — one step farther — and she would have been dashed to pieces, in the abyss, which yawned below. That crag, terminating the glade, commanded a wide horizon to the north and west. A horizon of mountains, framing immense masses of forests, through whose depths of summer green, two winding rivers shone like liquid silver in the setting sun. Marion looked below and shuddered. From the chasm beneath great trees arose, but a hundred feet of granite intervenes between their summit and the summit of the rock. To the west she looked, and the flush of sunset, tinged her brown cheeks and chesnut hair, with light and rapture. A blue canopy, with only one cloud — and that was in the path of sunset, unfolding its white breast, to the gaze of the dying Day. But from afar — over the waste of woods, and near where the mingling rivers shone — came glimpses of a vision, which stirred the maiden's heart with awe and wonder. Glimpses of armed men, whose burnished weapons, shone in the sunlight, like fire-flies through the gloom of night. Armed men, in ranks and columns, marching under banners, with horsemen riding in their midst. Now she saw them slowly ascend a hill, which rose suddenly from the forest — soon they were lost to sight — but at length came into view again, dotting the slope of a wide meadow, with points of dazzling light. On the brow of the crag, clinging with one hand to a sapling, whose leaves swept her dark hair, while the other shrouded her eyes from the sun, the Maiden stood gazing with indefinable wonder, on the march of the unknown army. Not until the sun went down, and darkness wrapt the landscape, and the chill mist, wandered a like ghostly form, through the glen, and before the cabin door, did the forest girl retreat from the verge of the crag. Within the cabin, a pine-torch, inserted in a crevice of the logs, above the hearth, flung a ruddy light. The cabin was but one spacious room, with two couches, of deer-skin, standing in opposite corners — walls of log — rudely constructed hearth — and floor as rude, sprinkled with pine branches and fragrant moss. Their evening meal was past, and a slight fire burned on the hearth, for the atmosphere of the night — although it was a mid-summer night — was damp and chill. The old man was seated on his bench, leaning his elbows on his knees, and resting his cheeks in his hands; his grand-child stood near a shelf, her lifted hand grasping a book, and her face turned over her shoulder, towards his motionless form. The light played in flashes over the moss-covered floor, and tinted with radiance the dark logs which formed the cabin floor. “But when I die,” said the old man, as if thinking aloud — “And there are not many days left to me — when I die, what will become of — you?” The girl was about to answer, when the door opened with a crash, and a harsh voice was heard — “Why I'll take keer of her, old Abr'am. I promise you that! I think o' settlin' in these clearin's somewhere, and I'd jist like to have a little woman o' that shape and complexion, fur my cabin.” The old man knew the voice; the sound of its accents seemed to penetrate his blood. He started to his feet, and fell back again with a shudder. The arm of the girl lifted to reach the book, was palsied in the action — her face, turned over her shoulder, grew deathly pale. Meanwhile the intruder advanced to the centre of the floor, and stood in the glow of the hearth-side. Picture to yourself, a form six feet and more in height, with long limbs, lean bony arms, narrow shoulders and shrunken chest, and a thin scraggy neck, supporting a small head, covered with masses of red hair. A face with harshly moulded features, small eyes deep sunken, prominent nose and bulging brow. A costume made of fragments of military uniform, and backwoodsman's attire — a short green coat laced with gold, breeches of deer-skin, boots of dark leather, a belt, powder-horn, and spurs. One hand resting on a rifle, the other grasping the hilt of a hunting knife. Such was the intruder; a man notorious among white and red men — among British and French, as a dead shot and a reckless bravo. In the course of a few years he had been seen fighting on all sides; now at the head of a band of Indians; now in the ranks of the Provincial soldiers; and a year before, at the battle of the Great Meadows, he had been prominent among the French, who attacked the little band of young Washington. His real name, tradition tells us, was Michael Burke; but the cognomen by which he was named among the Indians, effaced his proper designation. More in regard to his disposition and the color of his hair, than to any rule of natural philosophy — we presume — he was called simply — “The Red Wolf!” And it was this title shricking from the lips of the girl, and murmured by the old man, which elicited a grim smile from the bravo himself. As he stood gazing into the fire, old Abraham made a quick and stealthy sign to his grand-child. She saw and comprehended that brief gesture. It meant — “Bring me my rifle!” The rifle stood beneath the shelves on which her books were placed. She seized it, was darting forward, when the Red Wolf wheeled suddenly round, and interposed his ungainly form, between the girl and her grandfather. “Ra-a-ly it makes me laugh!” he cried, devouring the beauty of that young face, with a coarse stare — “Why the gal's a-goin' to battle surely! Which way my purty robin, with that shootin' iron? You look so nice, and so bright about the eyes, that I think I must e'en have a kiss” — He advanced — the girl, frightened and pale, sank back, still grasping the rifle. “Marion!” the old man cried — “Do not let go the rifle. Remember — there is neither mercy nor humanity about this man. Keep the rifle girl, and —” The old Hunter started to his feet, and stood behind the bravo, his features animated by an intensity of hatred and disgust. “Oh, yer thar, are ye'!” — and the Red Wolf turned his head over his shoulder, and saluted the old man with a hideous grin — “I remember you last in the fight of the Great Meadows. I do. For I aimed at your topknot no less than ten times. I did. In a minnit you and I — will have a talk together, but now —” He turned toward the girl, uttering an oath. The young maiden still leaned for support against the wall, clutching the rifle with her hands, but between the bravo and the girl, there stood a young man in the garb of a Provincial soldier, whose remarkable free and commanding form, enchained at once the eyes of Marion — of Abraham — and “the Red Wolf.” And this young man, standing so calmly, between the bravo and the girl, his chapeau in one hand, a pistol in the other, simply exclaimed: “You had better retire Michael. The soldiers are waiting for you at the foot of the glen. Go! And tell them to push on without delay — I will join them on the road.” And the Red Wolf, without a word, slunk to the cabin door and was gone. No words can picture the surprise manifested on the faces of the old man and his child. With a simultaneous glance they remarked the costume and appearance of the stranger. He was clad in a blue coat, trimmed with silver lace; he wore military boots, a belt, sword and pistols. His countenance, very pale, and marked by features at once regular, intellectual, and full of calm dignity, was lighted by large grey eyes. “Why Abr'am don't you know me. Forgotten so soon! Only a year ago you fought by my side, in the battle of the Meadows — have I passed from your memory already?” And the young man advanced and extended his hand — the old man grasped it warmly — “Colonel!” he ejaculated, “Surely God has sent you hither!” “I am on my way to join the main body of the army under Braddock. You know our destination — Fort Duquesne! Two weeks ago I was left with the rear, prostrated by a fever, from which I am only half recovered. A few moments since passing near your cabin, I was attracted by the sound of voices; I tied my horse before the door, and to my astonishment found the `Red Wolf' here —” “But will he not return?” gasped the old man — “Or plan some act of treachery —” “No danger, Abr'am,” returned the young man with a smile — “He is true to the side that pays best. Last year he was French — they paid best. Now he is retained by our General, as Guide, Spy, and so forth. He leads our rear division through the woods. He will be faithful so long as there is a purse before him, and a loaded pistol at his temple.” A harsh sound was heard — the young man turned, and for the first time seemed conscious of the presence of the forest girl. The rifle had fallen from her grasp. She leaned for support against the wall, her arms folded, and her cheek pale and red by turns. “My grand-child!” said the old man, and he repeated the name of the young officer. As the girl advanced, and took the proffered hand of the Colonel, and in her simple way bade him welcome to that forest home, he gazed upon her face — into her eyes — with a long and absent glance. A glance which mingled admiration and reverence. Admiration for a face and form so beautiful, reverence for a soul so chaste and pure, as that which lighted her large eyes. And the girl gazed without shame upon the noble form and handsome face of the young officer, and when she spoke, her voice was low, musical, and full of delicate intonations, her language the speech of a pure and educated woman. For a while the young man gazed in her face — long, intently — while the thought half escaped his lips — “So beautiful, and in this forest, by the hearth of a dying old man!” His reverie was broken by the old man's voice — “Colonel you will stay with us to-night. You are not yet sufficiently strong to bear the fatigues of the march. You will remain — will you not, and pursue your way tomorrow?” The young man gazed around the cabin with a smile — “I am afraid the person of a rude soldier like myself, might inconvenience you. Thanks friend Abr'am for your kind offer, but I must be on my way to-night. There will be a battle before many days, and I would not, for any consideration, be absent from its danger and glory.” And while he spoke to the old man, his eyes were fixed upon the girl, his heart possessed by an overwhelming wonder — “This beautiful maiden, dwelling in the wild forest, alone with a dying old man! There is a mystery here. Last year I saw him at the battle; ah! I remember — he spoke of a grand-child then, who awaited his return home. And when he dies, she will be left alone! An Orphan — young — friendless — cast upon the mercy of the world!” This Thought did not rise to his lips, but it absorbed his soul. The light of the torch disclosed a sight by no means without interest or beauty. These young forms, the one embodying all that is pure in maidenhood — the other, the courage and thought of young manhood — while the old man, with withered frame and white hairs, looked like an image of old Time, gazing upon Youth and Hope. “In an hour,” said the Colonel, “I must be on my way —” The old Hunter swept aside the hide of a buffalo, which hung along one side of the cabin. An aperture like a doorway was disclosed. Taking the pine knot in his hand, Abraham exclaimed — “Come hither, my friend. Let me converse with you alone.” And followed by the young Colonel, he lead the way through the passage, into a large chamber, with high walls and lofty ceiling. The floor, the walls, the ceiling, were white as Parian marble. And as the old man stood beneath the lofty arch, and raised the glaring torch, its light fell upon the most beautiful flowers and fruit — all fashioned out of stone by the hand of nature — looking like the ghosts of dead lilies and roses. The young officer stood motionless and wonder-stricken. “Do not wonder,” said old Abraham — “Our cabin is built on the side of a hill, and before the mouth of the Great Cavern, which pierces the womb of the mountain. Colonel I have brought you here, so that you may listen to the words of a dying man.” There was a solemnity, a sadness, in the old man's tone, which pierced the heart. “I will listen,” murmured the Colonel. “In a few days — perchance — in a few hours, I will be dead. To you I will confide a secret which I never entrusted to living man. Listen to a fatal Revelation —” And as the young officer sank upon a seat of stone, with that solemn Chapel of Nature all around him, the old man's voice broke the stillness, and awoke the echoes of the place. For an hour, Marion, seated near the fire, awaited the re-appearance of Abraham and the young stranger. We will not picture her thoughts, but her large bright eye was forming air-castles among the coals which glared on the hearth; her bosom rose and fell; maybe a vision of the old man, dead, and his grand-child alone in the world, passed over her soul. And even amid her waking dreams, she heard the tones of the old man, breaking low and murmuring from the Cavern Chapel. The hour passed, the old man and the Colonel came forth from the Cavern Chapel, and Marion, looking up, saw that the face of the young man was very pale — that there were tears in his eyes. “Good night, my friends —” his voice was hurried and broken — “Abraham I have promised, and will obey. When the Battle is over — if God spares my life — I will come this way on my return home, and attend to your last request.” He took the hand of Marion — pressed it warmly — gazed upon her with a look which filled her with wonder — then grasped the hand of the old Hunter, and passed rapidly to the door. But even on the threshold he staggered and fell. It is no fiction that we are writing; weakened by disease, worn down by fatigue — every faculty of his soul roused into action by the Revelation of the old man — the strength of the young soldier gave way at last, and like a dead man he fell to the floor. When they raised him from the floor, the forest girl and the old man together, he was chilled and fevered by turns; his eye unnaturally bright and vacant, his cheek now pale as a shroud, and now fired as with a living flame. And all the night long, extended upon the old man's couch, he struggled with the madness of fever, now telling them to bring his horse, so that he might ride to battle — now starting up with livid lips and glaring eyes, and shouting forth the words of the battle charge — and sinking at last into a half dreamy slumber, with the name of “Marion!” on his lips. And sometimes the young girl, watching by his couch — cooling his fevered brow with her hand — shuddered as she heard the words of the old man's “Revelation” on the tongue of the delirious soldier. Morning came; still the sick man was racked by pain and tortured by delirium. And while the old man prayed by his bed, the young girl wandered forth and gathered certain plants, commended by the rude Indian's lore, and prepared a potion, which gave sleep — oblivion — to the young Virginian. The day wore slowly away, and the horse of the soldier, tied to a tree and fed by the old man, neighed wildly, as if to arouse his master, and call him from his bed to the scenes of the battle. Towards evening the sick man unclosed his eyes. Was it a Dream? — the beautiful form that hovered near his bed? A glimpse of sunlight stole through the opened door, and illumined the beautiful face of the Watcher — the sad, tender eyes, centred upon the pale brow of the soldier — the young face, blooming with youth, and shadowed by luxuriant chesnut hair. For a long while the sick man did not speak. He feared to break the spell which held the beautiful Dream so near his bedside. At last endeavouring to recall his wandering thoughts, he asked — “How long have I been ill?” The maiden started at the sound of his voice — “Since last night,” she answered, remarking with undisguised joy, the healthy brightness of the speaker's eye. “It is then the Eighth of July — ” he cried, with an accent of the deepest regret — “And I am here, when the army are winning laurels. Ah! the Spy has left my soldiers in ignorance of my visit to this place; they have gone on without me — they are now with Braddock. Abr'am my friend, I must away!” The old man answered his call; while the girl stood apart, they conversed together. He rose, and although still weak, discovered that he was strong enough to mount his horse. He hastily resumed his coat, his sword and pistols, and stood ready to depart. “Farewell, Marion!” he said, extending his hand, “In my delirium I dreamed of a Good Angel, watching by my bed, and placing her hand upon my brow. It is a Dream no longer, for I am awake, and the Good Angel is still before me. Farewell! When the Battle is over and Fort Duquesne won, I will see you again.” He hastened to the door; his horse, a dark bay, stood pawing the earth, beneath an oaken tree. He was in the saddle, his tall form, looking magnificent in the light of the setting sun; his cheek still pale, but his eye bright and flashing. And the white-haired man stood near the stirrup, and at his back came the brown-haired girl, her large eyes raised to the warrior's face. “How far is it to the confluence of the the Monongahela and the Yohiogeny? Braddock was to encamp there the night before he advanced upon Fort Duquesne.” The old Hunter gave him directions, in relation to a short path through the wilderness — “You will reach it ere midnight, Colonel — God go with you,” he said. The soldier ere he put spur to his steed, bent over the saddle, and fixing his gaze upon the face of the maiden, lifted her hand to his lips. “Farewell!” he said, and his steed bounded down the glen. The tall form of the rider rose between the gaze and the sky, flushed by the declining day. The maiden stood near the white-haired man, following that warrior form with her eyes, until the horse and the rider went together into the shadows. “He will return when the battle is over,” said Marion, like one awakening from a dream. That night, where the waters of the two rivers mingle, Braddock standing among the veterans of his host, pressed the young soldier by the hand, and joyfully exclaimed — “Welcome, Washington! We are only fifteen miles from Fort Duquesne — we will rest there to-morrow!” To-morrow! The battle was over. It was the Tenth of July, 1754, and seven hundred corses, lay beneath the scalping knife, near the banks of the Monongahela. The French and Indians were holding festival among the dead; the white man had his dance and his wine, and the red man, his harvest of scalps — all among the dead of Braddock's field. And through the wilderness, over the very path where an army eager for battle, sure of victory, passed two days before, fled the dismayed wreck of twelve hundred warriors. A young soldier, stood on a crag, which overlooked a valley, and commanded a glimpse of the distant Monongahela. Two horses had fallen under him in the battle; the third had died of fatigue in the terrible flight; and the fourth — a while horse, worthy of his rider — was tied to a neighbouring tree. This soldier standing upon a crag, with arms folded, and lip pressed between his teeth, looked down — and saw the wreck of Braddock's army whirl beneath him, like a torrent suddenly undammed. Men without arms, men faint with wounds, men dying on the road, and stretching their hands in vain to their brothers — this was part of the sight which he saw. But the full terror, and confusion and panic of that flight, who can paint? And there borne in a tumbril, which was rudely jolted by the irregularities of the road, Braddock, the General, was slowly dying, devoured at once by pain and remorse. His folly had sacrificed seven hundred men. No wonder that the brow of the young soldier darkened, no wonder that his bosom heaved, as he saw this miserable wreck of an army, whirl by, without purpose or aim, save to place mountains and rivers between its living and the fatal field on which its dead men lay. The blue uniform of the young soldier was marked by bullets and stained with blood. He had dared the fiercest peril, shared the darkest danger of the fight — his ears were filled even now with the shrieks of the dying. But in the fight the Face of a beautiful Girl had been near him — hovering now on the white mist — now smiling from the dark cloud. Her Memory had never forsaken his heart. And the story of her life, and of the life of her People — told by the old Hunter in the Cavern Chapel — had made its impression on his soul. “When the Battle is over I will return!” And now he was returning — from no victorious field — from the Acaldema of the West — the glen in which the Hunter's cabin stood was not one hundred yards from the crag; he had stolen from the retreating army for a brief hour; he would visit the cabin, and join his comrades near midnight. Leaving his horse by the tree, he hurried down the rock, he drew near the glen. How visions of the future rose before him in that hurried and lonely walk! He was young; he was brave; but twenty-three years old, he had already won a name of which the oldest warrior might be proud. And even from the desolation of the wilderness, he might gather a wild flower to bless with its fragrance, his heart, his home. This forest girl, Marion, dwelling in the wilderness — alone with her grandsire — a beautiful form, an angel face, linked with an angel soul! Should she hold no influence on his life? Where in all the world could he find a heart so true, a soul so pure and virginal? Pardon the young man for these wild reveries — but he was young — the blood of early manhood was in his veins — the dreams of youth still blossomed about his heart. “She is so beautiful,” he thought, as he hurried along — “When the old man is dead, she will be left alone in the world. Can I leave her alone in the wilderness — can I desert purity and tenderness, like hers, in the hour of its loneliness? Ah — even now, it may be, she weeps over the corse of her only friend —” With that thought he hurried on. Before him, a tall rock rose in the sun — on the other side of the rock lay the glen which embosomed the cabin — the Home of Marion, the forest girl. “Ah — they are standing at the door, the old man and the beautiful girl. I will behold them as I stand at the foot of the glen. They await me. They have looked for my coming all day long.” Thoughts like these crowded upon him: his blood began to bound; he looked toward the rock, and hastened onward. He reached the rock, passed it, and looked up the mountain glade! It was bathed in sunbeams on one side; wrapt in shadow on the other; he stood at its southern extremity, and from its northern termination caught a glimpse of the smiling sky. But the cabin was not visible, for it stood among the trees, buried — all save the rugged door — by boughs and vines. Neither did he behold the image of the old man, with the dark-eyed girl standing near. A hundred paces lay between him and the cabin. Do not smile at his violent agitation; do not chide him for his wild enthusiasm, for the Face of the girl is present with him now, as he hurries on — he hears her voice as he heard it in the delirium of fever — he resolves to bear her from this forest dell, and show the gay world what beautiful flowers are reared by God, even in the howling wilderness. He nears the cabin door — And you will remember that the young Virginian, in mere personal appearance, was worthy of the proudest woman's love. He was tall — well-proportioned — his face moulded not so much after the “classic style,” but moulded — as a face should be, which is intended to express the manhood of a chivalric heart. He stands at last before the cabin door. Framed in flowers, the face of the young girl looks forth from the shadows — the withered hands of the old man are extended in the act of blessing him. No — No. The flowers before that door are withered. Blasted the flowers, the leaves — the very boughs are green no longer, but stripped of life, they fling their black limbs to the light. Where the cabin stood two days ago, now is only a pile of sightless and smoking embers! It was a moment, such as do not occur to any man twice in a lifetime. He stood palsied, gazing upon the ruins and the blackness, looking for some traces of a living being — but unable to speak or move. “Marion!” he said in a broken voice. No answer came. A stillness like midnight was upon the place. The young soldier advanced — blackness and ashes, nothing but ruins wherever he turned. The mouth of the cavern was before him. The memory of the old man's Revelation came back at the sight; he passed into the Chapel, and saw the sunshine stealing over those flowers and fruits of gold. But the Chapel was vacant — no sound or trace of humanity. It was like a tomb. Deeper into the cavern the young man passed — while he was gone, the night came down — and when he came forth, his face looked hollow, ghastly by the light of the rising moon. There was a single tress of brown hair wound about the clenched finger of his right hand. He hurried away, he mounted his horse, he joined the retreating army. But never from his lips passed a word concerning the fate of the old man or his child. But when America became a nation, there was in the cabinet of the President a sheet of time-worn paper, encircling a faded tress of hair, and bearing the superscription — “Marion, July 11th, 1754.” That was the only record left on earth of the FIRST LOVE OF WASHINGTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEGEND TENTH. THE DEATH OF BRADDOCK. Braddock was dying. At the foot of a sycamore, whose white trunk glared like a ghost among the dark pines, was stretched all that remained of the brave General, who, five days before, had gone forth so proudly to gather laurels from the wild hills of Monongahela. His throat was bare; his face pale as a shroud, and imbued with the apathy of despair, that neither hopes nor fears, was illumined by eyes that shone more brightly as the night of death came on. Sometimes he lifted his hand to the fatal wound near his heart; sometimes he rolled his eyes around the faces of the dismayed spectators, and then, turning his own face to the shadows, he bit his nether lip, and longed for death. It was in a glen, whose northern side was bathed in sunlight; while the southern side was wrapt in shadow. A glen, strewn with broken arms and fragments of artillery, with here and there the body of a wounded man. Crowds of panic-stricken men were scattered in groups over the sward, talking with each other in low tones, and speaking with livid lips the name of the fatal massacre — Monongahela. It was the fourth day of their flight from that terrible field. For four days and nights they had pursued their way, stricken with panic, and only nerved to exertion by the example of their leader, a Virginian youth of twenty-three; and as they bore the body of their wounded General, now in a rude tumbril, now on horseback, and last of all in their arms. But five days ago he had gone forth so proudly on his war horse, bearing the commission of his king; and now, at the foot of a sycamore, alone in the dark wilderness, he was looking death in the face. While a group of soldiers, whose tattered uniforms and scarred faces bore traces of the fight, gathered near him, and watched his dying face, the valley or glen, only seven miles from Fort Necessity, became the theatre of a strange and varied scene. These soldiers had paused only for an hour, — paused that Braddock might die — but still possessed by the panic which had maddened them since the fatal day, they gave their baggage to the flames, buried their cannon in the bushes or underneath the sod, and stood panting for the moment when they might resume their flight. Therefore the glen was dotted by groups of affrighted soldiers, who talked in low tones with each other; therefore, through the shadows of the woods arose pyramids of flame; therefore, no man thought of meat or drink or repose. The only thought was this — When Braddock is dead and buried we will fly as we have fled, these four days and nights. The day was fast declining. Only two men, in that dreary valley, seemed to keep firm hearts within their breasts: — The man who was dying at the foot of the sycamore. — The young Virginian who stood near him, watching his agony with fearful eyes. The General reached forth his clammy hand: “George,” he said, and his voice was husky with death, “Let all but you retire. I would be alone with you before I die.” Washington took the offered hand, and the pale spectators retired in silence, gazing from afar upon the white sycamore. For some moments there was silence, while the living and the dying gazed steadily into each other's faces. Braddock's face, pale with death; clammy on the brow and glassy in the eyes — Washington's visage, pale from fever and fatigue but lighted by a soul whose fire never for a moment grew dim. It was a sad, a meaning contrast. At last the silence was broken by the husky voice of Braddock — “George, in a little while I shall be dead” — his lip did not quiver, nor his eye wander — “When I am dead let me be buried in my uniform, and let my body be protected from dishonor.” Washington pressed the cold hand, and answered in a subdued voice — “It shall be as you wish.” “George,” continued Braddock — and a last throb of pain distorted his face — it was only for a moment — “I have a last word to say to you. It is not of friends, now far away — I may have those who love me, who long for my return. But why speak of them? Before the sun is low, I shall be dead —” He paused and turned his face to the shadow. “Speak! If you have a message, I will fulfil it!” whispered Washington, bending over the dying man. “These weary days of our retreat have brought strange thoughts home to me!” said Braddock in a calm voice. “I scorned your advice — I did more — I scorned that instinct of a heroic sould which fills your bosom, and which is worth all the experience in the world. Behold the result!— An army cut to pieces — my name given out to dishonor — seven hundred corpses out of twelve hundred living men!” His eyes grew brighter — his voice rose. “Do not speak thus!” faltered Washington, wrung to the heart by the last words of the death-stricken man. “And for myself, a dishonored name, an unknown grave!” “No! no!” cried Washington. “There is no need of flattery at this hour. The truth, if never seen before, comes up terribly to us in the hour of death” — and the eye of the dying man suddenly brightened into new life. “Young man, I marked you in the hour of battle. I saw you resolved and calm, while all the rest were mad with rage, or palsied by dismay. That battle, which to me is dishonor, which to seven hundred others means only defeat and an unwept grave, to you — to you — is life and fame!” He dropped the hand of young Washington, and sank back against the tree, pale, and cold, and trembling. Washington could not speak. Bending near the dying General, one hand still extended, while the other shadowed his face, he felt the memories of his boyhood come over him — suddenly — like a burst of sunshine through a thunder cloud — and a thought of the Future took shape before him, and panted with life. Well was it that the shadowing hand hid the agitated face of young Washington from the gaze of the dying General. And over the dreary glen the fires were brightly burning, and through the thick foliage great pillars of cloudy smoke rose in the evening sky, and here and there, collected in groups of two and three, the dismayed soldiers watched the dying man from afar, and talked of the fatal day of Monongahela. It is a terrible thing to see one man ridden by the nightmare fears of insanity, but the most terrible insanity is that which throbs at the same instant in the breast of a large body of men, palsying and firing every heart by turns, and overwhelming the individuality of every man by one universal terror. A panic like this swayed the fugitives from Braddock's field. They were fresh from the scenes of massacre; they feared the war-whoop of the Indian might startle the silence of the pass before another moment was gone; they turned from side to side, in expectation of the rifle shot and yell of murder. And all the while Braddock was dying at the foot of the sycamore, with the young Washington kneeling near him. “George, had I won the battle, your name would have been lost to fame. But the battle lost, it was your glorious part to save the living from the dead, and bear the torn flag from the grasp of the enemy. Therefore the battle lost for me is a battle gained for you, a battle won for your country — for the day will come when your countrymen, remembering Braddock's fight, will call for their young hero, and demand his sword in a more glorious field.” Few words were spoken after this, between the dying and the dead. With the declining day, the life of Braddock faded fast away. When the sunset lingered on the top of the loftiest oak — it rises yonder on the northern side of the dell — there was no longer a dying man stretched at the foot of the sycamore. There was a corpse, clad in scarlet, with a deeper scarlet near the heart — a corpse, resting on the sod with leaden eyes, turned toward a glimpse of the sunset sky — and a group of silent and dismayed soldiers, standing near the dead, the form of young Washington rising over all. Some few paces distant, hardy backwoodsmen with spades in their hands, flashed the earth aside, and made a grave for Braddock in the centre of the road. A dreary road leading through the wilderness from Fort Necessity to Fort Duquesne, which had felt the hoof of his war-horse five days ago, and now was to embosom his corpse. Mournful, and yet sublime in its very desolation was the funeral of the dead General. The grave was sunken — a cavity yawned in the centre of the road — while the fresh earth lay piled in brown heaps on either side. The evening shadows were upon the scene. Still trembled sunset upon the lofty tree, and the golden sky began to deepen into night. They wrapped the dead man in a tattered flag. The red cross of England was laid upon his breast, and the folds of the torn banner shut him out from the light forever. They held his body over the grave; two rough backwoodsmen, one convulsed with rude emotion, the other calm and tearless as stone. The fearless man held the head of the General, and every eye remarked the giant stature, the broad chest and scarred face of the uncouth backwoodsman. “My Brother!” he said, as he gazed on Braddock's face — it was his rifle that had dealt the death to the General, on the fatal hill-side of Monongahela. At the head of the grave, his form erect and his forehead bare, stood Washington, his torn attire showing the bullet marks of Braddock's field The shadows gathered thicker — his face and its varied emotions were not visible — but through the stillness and the gloom they heard his voice, speaking some words of hope over the body of the dead. The form of those words, their exact memory has long since passed away, but Washington never till his latest hour forgot the twilight of that lonely glen, when standing at the head of the rude grave — dug in the centre of the road — he gave the body of Braddock to grave-worm and the clod. They lowered it into the grave — the rugged backwoodsmen, one trembling, the other firm and tearless. And as the last glimpse of light left the treetop, and the first star came out from the world of Heaven, they heaped the earth upon the dead, and levelled it like a floor, passing the men and horses and heavy wheels over the road where the hero slept. For they wished to save the corpse from dishonor, from the white man's scorn and the red man's steel. Thus, without one sound of funeral music — neither the roll of drum, or the shrill peal of musquetry — they buried Braddock, at the twilight hour, in the centre of the road. The tramp of foosteps, the tread of horses' hoofs, the groaning of the cumbrous wheels — these echoed sullenly over the grave, as the silent procession passed along — these were the only sounds which broke the silence of the General's funeral. Soon the fugitives were on their way again — through the forest, from the direction of Fort Necessity, came the murmur of their dreary march. Two figures lingered still — one near the grave, leaning on a sword, and the other near a tree, cutting some rude characters into its rough bark. And the one who leant upon his sword, and with a swelling heart stood over Braddock's corpse — for there was no traces of a grave — was Washington. The other; a giant hunter, grimly clad, with many a scar upon his face. You may guess his name. He traced with his hunting knife upon the bark of the tree, two crosses, one in memory of the place where Braddock lay — the other in memory of the hand which winged the fatal bullet, or, perchance, in memory of “Brother Arthur.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEGEND TENTH. THE KING AND THE PLANTER. In a venerable edifice, dedicated to the memory of a thousand years — crowded with monuments which resembled palaces — dense and heavy with the atmosphere of death — a young man stood one night in the fall of 1760, leaning against a column, his arms folded and his eyes cast to the floor. That ancient place was full of light and darkness — light more vivid than day, and darkness deeper than the night. The great pillars flung broad shadows over the floor, with belts of radiance quivering here and there; the monuments stood boldly forth in red light, their flowers of marble, and images of death, glowing into life and bloom; the arches of the place, stretching from pillar to pillar, and bewildering the eye with the intricate mazes of Gothic architecture, waved with the banners of a royal race. Banners rich with armorial splendors, and sad with emblems of the grave. The young man leaning with folded arms, against a pillar, gazed in silence down a broad aisle, which led among colossal monuments, like the track of time among the dead of past ages. It was an impressive sight which met his gaze. Advancing slowly, to the sound of low deep music, a coffin burdened with velvet and gold, appeared in the centre of a circle of lighted torches. Upon that coffin a crown was laid — it shone from the black velvet like a strange jewel, set upon the breast of Death. Around the coffin were yeomen of a royal guard, clad in gay attire, and behind it, a long procession extended far into the distance, until its light and splendor dwindled into one little point of brightness. There were priests clad in sable — princes tottering under the weight of robes, whose lengthened trains were borne by lines of vassals — peers whose coronets glimmered dimly under jet black plumes. The far-extending arches flung back the music, which groaned in a dismal chant for the dead — a dirge which had a voice but no sorrow, a moan but no tears. The same torch-light which flashed over the gorgeous sadness of the funeral array, beamed upon the face of the young man, while his form was lost in shadow. In that great temple he stood alone. On one side was darkness; on the other the coffin glittering with a crown, and the procession dwindling away in brightness, until it was lost in the distance. The face of the young man was by no means unhandsome. It was a fair face; the eye-balls somewhat protuberant, the nether lip hanging with an irresolute expression, but the eyes were clear deep blue, and the low forehead and blonde complexion were relieved by carefully arranged hair, strewn with white powder, after the fashion of the time. He was dressed in sable; on his left breast shone a single star. And while leaning against the pillar, his blue eye glanced upon the procession, the coffin and the mourners, which every moment drew nearer, the young man's face was agitated by a singular expression. It gave a glow to his cheek, imparted brightness to his eye, and made his irresolute lip, seem firm and determined. This expression was not sorrow — it was joy — joy whose very intensity was sublime. For standing alone, by a great column of Westminster Abbey, the handsome youth, whose form and face were ripening fast into beautiful manhood, did not weep as he beheld the coffin — did not feel his heart grow heavy with even one throb of awe, as the dismal funeral chaunt swelled wearily upon the air. It was the coffin of a king which he beheld. Within that coffin lay the corse of a powerful king. They were bearing him slowly along the broad aisle — amid encircling soldiers, priests and peers — under the arches hung with banners — with the chaunt of death, the solemn gleam of muffled arms, the sweeping of princely robes, and bearing him to the vault which yawned in the centre of the abbey. And yet there was no tear in the young man's eye. He gazed upon the coffin, watched each minute detail of the splendid mockery, and uttered in a low voice the simple words — “And I am King of England — now —” The young man was George the Third, gazing upon the funeral of his royal grandsire, George the Second. He felt it in every vein, it shone from his eye, and with an involuntary impulse, he reached forth his arm, exclaiming once more— “King of England — King of England —” King of England! Not the England which a Norman Robber conquered, one morning in the distant ages. Not the England which quivered under the iron footsteps of the Third Edward, or grew drunk with blood under the Eighth Henry. Not the England which saw Elizabeth upon the throne; Elizabeth who dipped her fair maiden hands in the blood of Mary, and boasted amid her virtuous orgies that she was, in truth, the Virgin Queen. Not the stern, heroic England which tried a crowned criminal, and sent him to the scaffold, as a warning through all time to Royal Guilt. Not the England which grew great and strong, stern in courage, mighty in its victories, mightier in its people, under the rule of a Brewer, named Cromwell. No! But an England, strong with the accumulated conquests of ages, red with the concentrated carnage of a thousand years: at once, infamous with consecrated Murder, and glorious with an Empire mightier than Imperial Rome. This young man, clad in sable — a star glittering on his breast — can lay his hand upon the Map of the World, and sweeping his Royal finger over England, Scotland, Ireland — over North America — over India — exclaim, without a boast: “This, and this — and this — one-eighth of the world, at least, is mine!” Was it not enough to bewilder even a royal brain? India, won by an hundred thousand corpses, multiplied by ten — Canada conquered with the blood of Wolfe, poured forth upon the rock of Quebec — North America, from Georgia to Massachusetts, secure under the dominion of British Custom, British Taxes, and British Law — Scotland, reeking with the carnage of Glencoe — Ireland, beaten down at last, trampled into dumb anguish, into slavery that had no lower deep — This was “England” in 1760, and over this England George the Second had reigned; and the handsome youth, George the Third, was about to reign. Therefore the spectacle of the royal funeral — the coffin with purple and gold, the death-chaunt and the long train of splendid mourners — brought no sorrow to the heart of the young man, who, leaning against the column, murmured — “I am King of England — now” — And there came no omen to fright the soul of the young King, there was no word of the future to make him feel afraid. The banners that waved from the wide arches, the priests and lords who came along the aisle, the chaunt of the death, and the coffin adorned by a Crown, only spoke to him of a glorious future, of a kingdom unbroken by dissension, an imperial sway, consecrated by God and acknowledged by men. And all the while through the dark night which brooded over London, Westminster Abbey illuminated for the reception of the royal corpse, shone like a funeral pyre. Let us for a moment gaze upon the handsome face which is turned toward the light, while the young form is buried in shadow. Let us mark the joy now glowing warmly on the cheeks and flashing clearly in the blue eyes. Let us stand in the midst of this dread Mausoleum, called Westminster Abbey, and while the splendors of a royal funeral mock the monuments that start into view on every side, and England sends her Prince and Priest to bury the dead King, we will look upon the face of the living Monarch, who, blessed by youth, is about to enter upon a glorious career. At this moment, we will ask one or more rude questions, in our plain, peasant way — Is there no danger in the future for this King? “Have the coming years any judgment for his Throne, any stern decree against his power and the power of Kings like him?” There is danger for the King; danger for his Throne; danger for the power of Kings like him. Where? In England? Is he not the Sovereign Lord, backed by a horde of Nobles, backed by a code of bloody penal laws? Not in England — but yonder? Yonder, over the ocean — follow me across the trackless ocean, into a land whose awful forests and dread solitudes, compare but poorly with Westminster Abbey, now flashing through the dark night, like a sublime funeral pyre. We are here, by the waves of the Potomac. A mansion, not remarkable for its height, or its breadth, or for the splendor of its architecture, rises on the summit of a gently sloping hill. It is half encircled by trees, and from yonder window, the ray of a lamp trembles out upon the dark river. Entering the room lighted by that lamp, we behold a man of twenty-eight years seated beside a table, his cheek resting on his hand. He is clad very plainly. In fact, he wears the costume of a Planter of 1760. His form, tall and muscular, his face sharpened in every outline, indicate a life of some experience and toil. Before him, on the table, rests a letter, and a sword whose long blade is covered with rust. It may be seen that there are stirring memories connected with the letter and the sword, for as the solitary man gazes upon them, his eye brightens and his cheek flashes into vigorous bloom. It is a very plain, uninteresting scene; such as we may behold at any moment of our lives. A man of twenty-eight years, seated alone, in a neatly furnished chamber, his cheek resting on his hand, and his brightening eye fixed upon a letter and a sword. Look upon him — mark each outline of his form — note each outline of his face. You see nothing remarkable in the scene. It is only a Virginian Planter, sitting alone in his home, by the banks of the Potomac, at dead of night. That is all you behold. The contrast between this solitary figure and Westminster Abbey, flashing with ten thousand lights, crowded by a royal funeral, tenanted by a dead King, and a living — is it not idle to think of any contrast? And yet the solitary Planter buried in thought, sees spreading before him a succession of wild and phantasmal pictures. He is dreaming, not in sleep, but dreaming wide awake. He is mounted upon a horse; that sword is in his hand; an army of peasants, only peasants, extends around him. He is in battle; his army is crushed in dust and blood. But another army darts into being from the dust and blood; his sword is still in his hand, and now — waving over his head — a flag, such a flag as never was seen before, flutters on the air of battle. There is another contest; there are cold faces upturned to a setting sun, and then the scene changes. Still it is only a dream, a wandering dream, but the Planter is in the Senate Hall of a People — how vague, how wild a dream! In the Senate Hall of a People — and amid the deep silence of a breathless multitude, he is invested with the crude insignia of a great office — he is hailed as the Liberator of a Nation — acknowledged as the Ruler of freemen. Such are the dreams of the Planter, and rising from his seat he advances to the window, and looks forth upon the night. He smiles as he thinks of his waking dream — and yet it still pursues him, with its pictures of battles all ending with a free people, all terminating in that scene, where a nation of freemen hail their Ruler in the person of their Liberator. Smiling at his vague wild thoughts, the Planter approached the table again — pauses for a moment while the light streams over his young face, already stamped with thought — and then absently, scarce conscious of the action, lays his hand upon his sword — There is the danger, which the future has in store for King George the Third. There — in that hand grasping the sword — in that eye lighting up with soul, in that face stamped with a Prophecy of the Future — there is the judgment which threatens the future of King George and all Kings like him. They are burying the dead King in the Abbey. They are placing the gorgeous coffin in the vault; there are lines of torches, and splendid apparel, deep crowds of mourners, and a living King beside his grave. At the same moment, perchance the Virginia Planter, away in his new-world home, in his silent chamber, grasps his sword, and dares to think of the Future. He utters certain half-coherent words — “This sword I wore at Braddock's field — and” — He did not say where he would wear it again, but his hand presses firmly the hilt of his sword. Was his dream false? Did that sword ever threaten the power of King George?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEGEND TWELFTH. WASHINGTON'S CHRISTMAS. A LEGEND OF VALLEY FORGE. An ancient pistol, grim with the dents of battle, black with the rust of years, its stock of dark mahogany inlaid with brass, its barrel at least fourteen inches long, its tarnished lock bearing the dim inscription, “G. R.—1718,” traced beside the figure of a Royal Crown. An ancient clock, looking out from its coffin-like case, with its dusky countenance sculptured into dead flowers, the words “Augustin Neiser, Germant'n, 1732,” engraven in distinct round hand, beneath the hands — an ancient clock, whose bell rings out through the silence of the night, with a clear, deep, silver sound, like the knell of a dead century; the last word of the last of an hundred years. An ancient arm chair, framed of solid oak, the paint worn long ago from its brown arms, the rude carvings which surmount its high back, worn long ago, as smooth as polished marble, with the letters “J. K., 1740,” cut in rough old German text, well nigh blotted out by the touch of an hundred years. An ancient Bible, massive in its heavy covers, and clasped with pieces of carved silver, its pages, embronzed by age, stained with the traces of many a bitter tear, comprising that “Family Relics” — in itself the history of a race. An ancient round table, fashioned of walnut, that was planted on the Wissahikon hills, three hundred years ago, when there were Red Men in the land, who rudely worshipped God in the rocks and trees and sky, and made Religion of their Revenge — an ancient round table, once strong and firm, but now creaking and groaning as with the anguish of its memories, that reach far back into the shadows of an hundred years. — They are all in my room, at this dead hour of midnight and silence, as I write these words, all glaring in the light of the wood-fire which crumbles on the hearth. The clock stands in the corner, pointing to twelve, the arm-chair is near it, spreading forth its arms, as if to catch the full warmth of the fire. The Pistol with its voiceless tube, rests upon the Round Table, on which I write, and outspread before me, is the venerable Book with its clasps of silver. I might tell you the story of these Relics of the Past, and believe me, the story which they bring home to me — or rather the hundred different Legends — would make the tears stand in your eyes, the blood pulsate tumultuously about your hearts. For in that arm-chair, more than a hundred years ago, an old man sate, bearing the name which now is mine, and lifted his withered hands and blessed his five sons, five manly boys, reared in the woods of Wissahikon, which I am so foolish as to love and cherish, even at this hour, when it is blasphemous to love any God, but the Lord of the Silver Dollar. That old man — whose bronzed face and hair as white as drifted snow, presented a true Image of that French-German race, who left their native land, and brought their Spiritual Faith, which taught that God might be worshipped without Church or Priest, or Creed, here, to the hills of Wissahikon, here to the rolling vallies, called Germantown — that aged Father, laid his withered hands upon the brown locks of his sons, and blessed them as he died. Of the Fate of those sons, a volume might be written. Not a volume for those to read, who love big names, and pretty uniforms, and smooth sentences, soft and tasteless as the pulp which fills your Critic's skull, and passes for brains — no! But a volume for those ignorant souls, to read and love, who like to see the Providence of God, shining out, even from the records of the humblest Home. One son, went forth from that old man's roof and in the Dream-Land of Wyoming, reared himself a Home, and worshipped God, even as his father, without Priest — save the voice of his own soul — or Temple, save that which was sheltered by his fireside rafters, or that glorious church which had the Mountains for its pillars, the green vallies for its floor, and for its dome, the blue canopy of God's own sky. That son fell in the Massacre of Wyoming; at this hour the white monument, erected on the banks of the Susquehanna, bears his name, enrolled among the Martyrs. Another son, died in battte, in the cause of Washington. Of the Third and his race, all traces were lost, until two years ago, when I pressed the hand of his grand-son, who came from the hills of Carolina. The Fourth went forth into the western wilds and left no trace or record of his fate. The Fifth and last son, dwelt all his life in the home of his fathers, and saw many children blossom into the bloom of womanhood, or the prime of manhood. Death has reaped every man of them all, and gathered them into the full sheaf of the graveyard: and at the present hour, the author of these lines is the only man that bears the name of the white-haired Patriarch who one hundred years ago sat in the arm-chair and blessed his children as he died. You will therefore know what I mean, when I say that these relics of the Past, have a voice for me, as sad, as tender, as a sound from the lips of the dying. The old clock that rings so deeply now, its silver voice pealed as clearly in the bloodiest hour of the Battle of Germantown. The Round Table on which I write, once bore the paper on which Lord Cornwallis traced the hurried and deadly details of the fight. But it is not of these historic memories that I speak: No! There are other and more tender memories. That old clock pealed at the birth hour of all my people, and rung their knell as one by one they died. Around the Table, how many faces have been gathered in a Circle of Home, faces that now are lost in graveyard dust! In that old chair, many a form has reposed — how many, how revered, how dear —that now find rest, within the narrow panels of the coffin! And the old clock, like a spirit whom no anguish can one moment sway from his calm watch over the dying men and dying years, rings out now, clear and deep, as it will ring when I too, am gathered to the graveyard sheaf. The Pistol too, so grim in its battered tube and stock, has a story — sad, touching — linked with the tradition of the Round Table, the arm chair, the clasped Bible and centuried Clock. The pistol alone, never belonged to my people, but there was a time, in the dark hour of the Revolution, when Clock and Chair, Bible and Table, passed into the hands of a collateral branch of my race, and became connected with the grim thing of death, in a Legend of harrowing yet tender details. Let me tell you that Legend now, while the old cloak, with its silver voice, rings out the Hour of Twelve! There was snow upon the hills; a mass of leaden cloud, with broken edges, was hung across the sky; through the deep gorges, down to the river, roared the winter wind, howling the funeral song of the dying year; and yet, within the stone farm-house of Valley Forge, the Christmas fire burned with a warm and cheerful glow. A spacious room, with white walls and sanded floor, huge rafters overhead, and a broad hearth, heaped with massive hickory logs. On that hearth, in the oaken chair, sat a man of some sixty years; his athletic form, clad in coarse garments of reddish brown, his hands, cramped by toil, laid on his knees, while his face glowed with its long beard and hair turning grey, and hues darkened by the summer sun, in the cheerful light of the Christmas fire. True, the garments of the old man were of coarse home-spun — true, his floor was covered by no gay carpeting — the huge rafters overhead concealed by no paint or plaster, and yet, as he sate there, the room had a joyous look, full of the word home, and his dark brown cheek, with its hair and beard, silvering from brown to grey, spoke something of a heart at peace with God and man. Crouching on the hearth, her head laid on the old man's knee, a girl of sixteen years — her young form blossoming fast into the shape and ripeness of woman — turned her clear hazel eyes towards the light, and twined her small hands among the cramped fingers of the old man. Her form was attired in plain home-spun — boddice and skirt of dark brown — and yet it was one of those forms, which, in the warm bosom just trembling into virgin ripeness, the lithe waist, and the rounded outlines of the shape, remind you very much of a flower that quivers on the stem, the red bloom just peeping from the green leaves, and quivers more gently in the moment when it is about to burst the leaves, and blush into perfect loveliness. A very loveable girl, with a soft, innocent face — almost soft as infancy, and innocent as the prayer of a child — was this maiden, crouching by her father's knee on the hearth of stone. Her brown hair, parted in two rich masses, flowed over his knees, and half concealed their hands. “Katrine,” said the old man — he bore the plain German name of Israel Kuch, and spoke with a German accent — “it is now twenty years and more, since I left my native land, with the brethren of my faith. They would not let us worship God in our own way; so we followed Him into the wilderness, and made our homes where no man dare murder his brother on account of his creed. You know our custom, Katrine?” The young girl looked up, and in a voice soft and whispering, answered: “Every Christmas night, at the hour of twelve, when the Lord Christ was born in the manger of Bethlehem, we sing the Christmas hymn, and read a chapter from the Book of God.” You see this old pioneer of the wilderness, dwelling in the woods of Valley Forge, has planted in the heart of his child the name of Jesus! Silently she rose, and gazed upon the old clock — it stands there, in the corner, with its broad face to the fire, pointing to the hour of twelve — and then taking the old Bible with silver clasps from the table, she laid it on her father's knees. A Christmas Picture! The old man, seated in the arm-chair, the young girl, in her virgin bloom, bending before him, the same fireside glow, warming his withered face, her velvet cheek, and revealing the opened Bible, whose silver clasps shone like stars in the ruddy light. Israel's face was suddenly mantled with deep sadness: “There was a time, Katrine, when your mother was here to sing the Christmas hymn. She sleeps in the grave-yard now —” There was another absent, whose memory comes freshly to their hearts, though his name is not upon their lips. “He, too, is absent from home. He journeys with the men of war: he has forgotten that religion of peace which he learned by this hearth, when he sang with us the Christmas hymn!” The brave and fearless Konradt! Even now, turning her eyes — they were wet with tears — from the light, Katrine remembered him, her brother. A man of twenty years, with a form like the forest poplar, a ruddy brown face, brilliant with large grey eyes and shadowed by masses of chestnut-colored hair. Katrine saw him as he looked on the day — nearly a year gone by — when, with his true rifle in his grasp, he passed the threshold of home, bound for the Camp of Washington. The old man knelt, and laid the Bible on the chair. Without, the storm howled, and the snow fell — within, the Christmas fire flung its merry blaze, and the voice of prayer arose. By her father's side, knelt the young girl, placing her clasped hands on her bosom, while the fringes of her closed eyelids swept her cheek. And as the storm howled, the old man read hose words which are at once poetry and religion. Beautiful it was to hear, in that lonely home of Valley Forge, swelling from an old man's lips, the very words which the Christians of Rome, hunted to death, like wild beasts, read in the catacombs — those cities of the dead, hidden beneath the city of the living — eighteen hundred years ago! And there were in the same country, shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, fear not: for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. The clock rung forth the hour of twelve, as the last word died on the old man's lips. Clasping their hands over the Bible, they bent their heads in silent prayer, her brown curls mingling with the grey hairs of her father. And the fireside light shone over them, as they knelt, and baptized them with its glow. But suddenly, breaking like a thunder crash upon that house of prayer, a sound was heard, mingling with the howling of the storm, and yet heard distinctly from that howling, as the musket shot is heard through the cannon's roar. A footstep — it is in the yard without the farm-house — it is upon the stone steps leading to the porch — it is upon the porch, and the door springs with a crash, wide open. At once, with the same impulse, Israel and his child rise from their knees: with dilating eyes they behold the sight, which we may be hold with them. Upon the threshold stands a wild figure, gazing round the room, with a glassy — a horror-stricken stare. It is a man of some twenty-five years, whose hair and beard increase the deathly paleness of his face, with their raven-black hues, and give a wilder glare to his eyes — so dark, so bright, so full of horror. “John!” — the solitary word shrieked from the maiden's lips, for in the wild form she recognized her lover — her betrothed husband. “John!” the old man echoed — “you are a man of peace reared by my dearest friend, your father, in the lessons of the Gospel, and yet I behold you standing here, on Christmas night, a bloody weapon in your hand — that hand itself stained with blood!” Not a word from the lips of the intruder! Staggering forward, he dashed the pistol on the floor — it is there, dripping blood, even where the flame glows brightest — and sank, like a lifeless mass, at the old man's feet. “Save me, Israel, save me!” — he shrieked — “for I have done murder, and the avenger of blood is on my track!” “You!” — the voices of the old man and his virgin child joined in chorus. “Yea — I — I! — the child of prayer;—I so far forgot the lessons which I learned from my father, as to become one of a secret band of Loyalists, who have taken an oath to uphold the cause of the King. They swore to have the life of the Rebel leader — cast lots, who should do the deed — the lot fell on me.” In the excess of his remorse, he suffered his head to droop, until his dark locks touched the floor. The old man stood as though a thunderstroke had blasted him, while Katrine, raising her hands to her forchead, gazed upon her lover with an expression of bewildered pity and horror. “I swore to do the deed! To-night, I saw Washington leave his quarters, near the Schuylkill — tracked him toward this farm-house — a solitary dragoon rode some few feet behind him. You see, I was wound up to madness by the horrible oath — I nerved my soul for the deed — I fired!” “You killed Washington?” “No — no! The night was dark — my aim unsteady — I fired — the pistol exploded in my grasp — I saw the dragoon, the innocent man, fall from his steed! I am a murderer — the curse of Cain — I feel it fasten on my forehead Hark! The Rebels pursue me — I am lost!” The sound of hoofs, the clattering of swords, resounded outside the farm-house. In a moment the Americans will enter, and secure the assassin. The strong man, who grovels on the floor — blasted all at once into an image of despair, more from remorse than fear — raised his head and moaned in a tone of agony — “Israel — I am lost!” “You have done a terrible thing in the sight of the Lord, John — but I will save you.” Hark! The soldiers have dismounted, they are on the porch — the old man drags the murderer from his knees, and points toward the eastern door. “Enter! It is the bed-chamber of my absent son. A secret passage — built in the time of the Indians — leads into the cellar, and from thence into the fields, a hundred yards from the house. You will find the door on one side of the fire-place — I, myself, will hurry to the fields, and open the spring-house door — for into the spring-house this passage leads!” With these muttered words, he thrust the murderer into the bed-chamber of his son — closed the door — and turned in time, and only in time, to confront a band of American dragoons, who rushed from the porch into the room. “The murderer?” shouted the foremost dragoon — a man stalwart in form, with a steel helmet, surmounted by a bucktail plume, on his brow, a sword gleaming in his hand. “The murderer? — where is he? He went this way — entered this house — we must have him —” The old man with his beard imparting a venerable appearance to his face, stood erect, in the presence of those armed men, and surveyed their drawn swords without a fear. And Katrine — where is she? Upon her knees, before the Bible, spread open in the old arm-chair, her brown tresses flowing over her shoulders, her eyes closed — the blood-stained pistol touching the folds of her dress. It was a moment of fearful trial to the aged Christian. He would not lie — he could not give up to certain death any man, even a murderer, who had claimed sanctuary in his home. And yet, he must either utter a lie — or surrender up to death the son of his old-time friend. “Why do you enter my home, with your drawn swords, at this still hour of Christmas night?” he slowly said, anxious to gain time. Hark! There is a creaking sound in the next room: the murderer has discovered the secret door. The only reply which Israel received was a sword levelled at his heart. “Come! no words! We know the Tory is in your house; and the Tory we will have, by —” The brawny soldier clutched the hilt of his sword, while the point was directed at the old man's heart. Meanwhile, in stern silence, his comrades gathered round, grasping their pistols and swords, with a death-like stillness. The Christmas light flashed over the kneeling and unconscious girl — over that solitary old man, and along the group of maddened soldiers. “Friend Thompson, you would not stab an unarmed man” — began Israel, in a voice that trembled with contending emotions. A sudden — a decided reply! The captain made one deadly thrust with his sword, and a half-uttered cry of horror, gasped in chorus by his brother soldiers, echoed round the place. For even to them, maddened by revenge, there was something horrible in this murder of an unarmed old man. The sword flashed home, to its aim. Does the old man fall a mangled thing, staining his own hearth with his blood? “Come, Captain, this is somewhat too British for an American soldier!” spoke a strange voice; and a murmur of surprise rose from every lip, as the Captain's sword fell clattering on the floor. Why that murmur of surprise? Why this sudden silence? Wherefore does even old Israel stand silent — wondering — dumb That stranger, with the commanding form, and noble face — stern, determined in its very mildness — rivets every eye. “Washington!” As the cry rose once more, the stranger advanced, and laid the bundle which he bore — a wounded man, his forehead marked by a hideous gash — upon the hearth, in the strong glare of the fire. The stiffened arms of the insensible man touched the dress of the unconscious girl. “Quick — my friends — some water for this wounded man!” said the stranger; “I fear me he is dying! I would not have him die thus, for our cause knows no braver man than Cornet Kuch!” The last word froze the old man's blood. So much had his gaze been rivetted by the solemn presence — the warrior form of that stranger — that he had not time to gaze upon the burden which he bore, half concealed in his cloak. But the last word cut him to the heart. He wheeled on his heel, and by the light of the Christmas fire beheld the wounded man extended on the hearthstone. His own son dying, with a hideous wound upon his forehead; lips, eyelids and cheek clotted with blood. For a moment he reeled backward from the sight, and turned his face away. The troopers stood as if spell-bound. Washington's face writhed with an expression of involuntary anguish. He turned his face to the group again. It was changed — horribly changed. That face, on which peace seemed to have set its seal forever, was now livid, ghastly, compressed in the lips, and wild as madness in the eyes. “My son!” he incoherently gasped. “Lord, Lord my God, this cup is too bitter! Let it pass from me! My son — Konradt! No! no! It cannot be!” There seemed to be a red light — a sea of blood bathed in the glare of flames — rolling before his eyes; his senses swam, his eye shone with horrible lustre. He strode forward and grasped the pistol from the belt of Captain Thompson. “He hath slain my son — the bone of my bone — the blood of my blood — the prop of my old age! Stand back and let me pass! The murderer is in the spring-house in the field. He shall die by my hands!” He rushed from the room into the night and the darkness. “Follow him,” cried Washington. “He will do harm to himself —and mark ye, let no one, on peril of life, do harm to the murderer of Cornet Kuch!” It was at this moment that Katrine awoke from her swoon. At this moment, when her father rushed forth, pistol in hand, to do a deed of murder — when the soldiers, stricken dumb by his agony, retreated from his path — when the voice of Washington was heard enjoining that no harm should be done to the murderer of her brother. She rose — swept back the brown hair from her brow — gazed upon her brother's form, with the fatal wound on his forehead. At a glance, by that divine instinct which God hath given to women, as he bestows glory upon his angels, poor Katrine read the whole dark mystery. “I will save my father from this deed of murder!” she cried, and darted into her brother's bed-chamber. Washington was alone with the wounded man. His cloak thrown aside, you see his tall form clad in the uniform of blue, relieved by buff, his good sword depending from the buckskin belt. His face, glowing with the mature manhood of forty-seven years, now bears upon every firm lineament the traces of deep mental anguish. He silently places the Bible on the round table, beside the arm-chair, lifts the bloody pistol from the floor, and then raises the dying man from his resting place on the hearth. Gently — like a dear mother nursing her child—he places the wounded soldier in the arm-chair, and bathes his brow with cold water. Then bending over the insensible man, surveying that frank countenance, now pale as death, he washes the blood away, while a deep ejaculation rises from his lips. It is a scene for us to remember — Christmas Night — the lonely farm-house — Washington, the Liberator of a People, revealed by the Christmas fire, as he bathes the brow of a wounded, a dying man. Katrine, with her heart throbbing as though it would burst, entered the door of the bed-chamber, and saw the wretched murderer, seated in one corner, the light revealing his livid face. “John, you must fly —” she exclaimed, in a calm voice, that sounded to him like the tone of a dying woman — “It is my brother who fell by your hand — but, I, the sister, will save you!” She opened the secret door within the fire-place, and turned upon him the light of her hazel eyes. — What words can picture the horror which broke from his countenance, then? “Your brother?” he gasped — “Konradt, the friend of my soul? Oh, this is some horrible dream! You know that I love you, Katrine — yes, with a love too deep to be offered to a creature — a love that is mad, idolatrous! Think you, I would harm Konradt? No — no! It is a trick of Satan to peril my soul!” He cowered upon the floor, and clutching her hands, looked with fearful intensity into her face. “Take your hands from mine, John — they are stained with my brother's blood. The door is open, the secret passage before you — fly! I bid you — I, the sister! But my father will not spare you — even now he hurries to the spring-house, to strike you as you seek to gain the woods! Fly!” “I will fly, but it is to meet my death at his hands!” He darted into the secret passage. — The memory of that livid face, was stamped in terrible distinctness upon the soul of the sister, as she gazed wildly around the room. Now was the moment for the child-like innocence of her character to spring, all at once, into the full bloom of a woman's heroism. A shade crossed her face — her red lip grew white — she tore the fastenings from her dress, for her heart throbbed and grew cold, until she gasped for breath — and in an instant, her disordered hair, could not altogether veil the transparent loveliness of that bared bosom. For a moment she tottered as though she would fall lifeless on the floor — the shroud on the form of death is not more pale than her face. In that brief moment, the image of her happy home, of the last Christmas, when John and Konradt and her father, sat grouped by the same fire — rushed vividly through her brain. “Now, one is dead — the other, will die by my father's — But no! God will help me — I will save them yet!” Light in hand, she darted into the shadows of the narrow passage. Down in the hollow yonder, near the Schuylkill, whose hoarse murmur swells through the night, rises a small structure of dark grey stone, with a solitary door, formed of heavy oaken panels, a steep roof, overarched by the leafless branches, and a small stream, winding from beneath that archway toward the river. In the summer time, this spring-house of Farmer Kuch is a very loveable thing to see. Then, the chesnut trees around it, are glorious with broad green leaves; there is a carpet of grass and flowers before the dark old door; the very brook, singing its way to the Schuylkill, is draperied with vines and blossoms. But now it is winter. The trees leafless, the brook shrouded in ice, the green prospect of hill and valley, transformed into a wilderness of snow. From that waste, the spring-house rises like a tomb, so black, so desolate, and alone. Beside the door, stands the farmer, Israel Kuch, cold damps like the death-sweat starting from his brow, as the pistol trembles in the grasp of his right hand. His livid face you cannot see — for the night is dark, but the flash of his dilating eyes breaks upon you, even in this midnight gloom. All his peace of soul is gone: in its place, nothing but madness and revenge. “Mine only son — the blood of my own heart murdered — no! Lord, I will not falter. Even as the Avenger of Blood, in the ancient days of Israel, followed the murderer, and put him to death, so Lord will I follow and put to death the murderer of my son!” Listen! There is a sound in the spring-house, a rattling as of bolts unfastening, within the door. Yonder glooms the farm-house, not one hundred yards distant, and over the waste of snow, the troopers come hurrying on. The old man, in his madness, has outstripped them. In a moment they will be here, but a moment will be too late. Listen! The bolt flies back within, but the lock without holds the door firm. With one blow the old man breaks the padlock, and with his finger on the trigger, clutches the pistol. and prepares to shoot the murderer as he comes. That was a moment of intense and sickening suspense. The door receded, and the ray of a lamp streaming through the doorway, revealed the old man's livid face, and flung his shadow far along the snow. It was the murderer, lamp in hand, seeking to escape! — Katrine stood there, her bosom bared to the cold, and defended only by her brown flowing hair. She did not see her father. How the heart of Israel throbbed in that terrible moment! But shading her eyes with her left hand, she called — “Father!” “I am here!” and transformed by his revenge into an image of unnatural emotion, his face from the beard to the brow, hideously distorted, he clutched the pistol and confronted his child. “O, father! can this be you? A pistol in your hand —” “The murderer of my son — where is he?” “But your lessons of peace, father, the Bible, which says, `Love your enemies' — your own heart, father —” “The Lord hath called me, Katrine, and I am here to do his bidding!” cried the wretched man, as the hollow glare of his eyes rested upon the pale face of the maiden: “Hark! the men of war come — they would cheat me of my victim. “Ah!” he groaned — “Mine only son, mine only son, — Konradt mine own boy!” There was something awful in the depth of his agony. Scarce had his accents died, when a form wilder than his own appeared in the doorway — a face streaked with a livid blue glowed in the light, and John the Murderer confronted the father of his victim. “Israel,” he said in a husky voice, “It is past! kill me! but forgive me, for verily, before God and the angels, I am a miserable man, a sinner who hath lost his soul forever!” With hands involuntarily joined, he stood on the snow, and awaited his fate. The old man shrank back at first, but as if gathering strength for the deed, he presented the pistol and fired. At the same moment the lights went out, and all was darkness. But did you see that young form bounding in the air, those white arms outspread? The aim of the pistol was turned aside, and Katrine, crouching on the snow, clutched her father by the knees. “O, father — you cannot do it — God will be angry with you — you cannot murder — nay! nay! do not shake me from your grasp — you taught me to love the Lord Christ, who says, `love your enemies,' and I will not see you do this deed!” “Ah! the murderer has escaped,” groaned Israel, struggling to free his knees from the grasp of that heroic girl. “No!” said a hollow voice, “He is here!” Through the gloom, Israel beheld the outlines of the murderer's form, as he stood with drooped head and folded arms. At the same moment the troopers, like shadowy forms, came hurrying round the corner of the spring-house, their arms gleaming indistinctly in the midnight darkness. But the old man saw them not. Reared from infancy to love the Bible, to love above all the gentleness, the forgiveness of the Gospels, at this moment of madness, the dark scenes of the Old Testament, the terrible judgments of the Mosaic dispensation, alone possessed his soul. “John, kneel on this sod, and pray forgiveness of your God, for at this hour I am about to put you to death!” “No — Israel — this won't do,” cried Captain Thompson, forgetting his own anger at the murderer, in overwhelming pity for the despair of the old man — “We will arrest the young man, but he must not be harmed; it's Washington's orders!” Fiercely the old man scowled upon the group — one desperate effort he made to shake off the clutch of his daughter, and at the same instant he seized a hunter's knife and sprang upon his victim! Every man in that crowd held his breath, but the brave girl did not unloose her grasp. Up to his heart she sprung, around his neck she wound her arms, and even as he struck, she baffled his deadly aim. His madness now swept over all bounds. There, unharmed, stood the murderer — there grouped the awed soldiers — there. hung to her father's neck, quivered the daughter. With one irresistible movement, he flung Katrine from his neck, and knife in hand, sprang forward. The strong man, with health in his veins, and youth on his brow, knelt calmly for the blow. “John, the Lord hath spoken, and I obey!” and the knife flashed in his hand. But hark! That cry heard over the waste of snow — it reaches the old man's heart, for it says “Father!” Every man in the group heard that cry, and felt his heart grow like ice, with an unknown fear — it was the voice of the dead man Cornet Kuch. “Joy — thank God — it is my brother's voice!” — You behold Katrine sink swooning on the snow. The old man stood with his knife in mid-air — stood bewildered — listening — dumb. “Father!” the voice was nearer. “Oh, can the demons mock me? Am I indeed given over to the Prince of the Power of the air?” Israel pressed his left hand to his burning brain. The troopers turned, gazed into the darkness, but they saw nothing save the indistinct outline of the farm-house, the cold dead sky. “This puzzles me, I'll be confounded if it don't!” muttered the stalwart Thompson, as even he, an image of robust health, felt his heart chill with superstitious fear. “Tell me — do I dream — that voice —” the old man staggered wildly over the frozen snow. “Father!” the voice spoke at his shoulder, this time. The old farmer turned, beheld a shadowy figure, laid his hand upon a gashed forehead. “Father! It is I — your son, Konradt — not killed, scarcely wounded—only a little stunned! Ha, ha! A mere scratch after all the outcry — come father, we will go home!” Israel fell like a weight of lead — so heavy, so suddenly — and lay on the snow beside his unconscious daughter. Another form advanced from the gloom, and a voice was heard — “Captain, secure your prisoner!” It was the voice of Washington. In the old farm-house and by the Christmas fire again. The broad face of the clock, points with its small hand to the hour of One. On the round table, rests the blood-stained pistol and the opened Bible. Before the fire, extended in the arm-chair, his form completely broken down by the horrible emotions of the past hour, Israel Kuch gazes in the faces of his kneeling children. Here, Konradt with the gash upon his brow concealed in a white cloth, there loveable Katrine, smiling as the tears course down her cheeks. The troopers wait in the yard, without, ready for the march. Up and down along the floor in front of the fire, paces Washington, his hands behind his back, his eyes cast downward. That face is stern as death. Now he pauses — steals a glance toward the group, and then — while a scarcely perceptible emotion quivers over his face — resumes his measured pace again. Where is the murderer in thought, the man who levelled his pistol at the head of Washington? Come with me through the eastern door, into this small bed-chamber, where a solitary lamp lights up the fire-place, the bed with unruffled coverlet, the old-fashioned chairs, and walls as white as unstained paper. Crouching on a chair, his knees supporting his elbows, with his cheeks pressed in his cold and trembling hands, behold the murderer. His pale face is framed in dark hair and beard — his throat is bare — his eyes, sunken in the sockets, shine with an anguish too big for utterance. Wrapt in his own fiery whirlpool of remorse, he does not hear the opening door, nor heed the advancing form. A hand is laid upon his shoulder; he looks up and beholds the stern face of Washington. As though a bolt had stricken him, he shrinks away from that hand, for well he knows, that taken in the act of a base assassination, he has but one Future — the gibbet and the felon's grave. “My friend, did I ever harm you?” said that deep-toned voice. John buried his face in his hands. “They speak of you as a quiet, a religious young man, descended from that class of the German people, who hold war and all that belongs to war, in decided abhorrence. I am anxious to know in what manner have I incurred your hatred — why arm yourself against my life?” There was a light in Washington's eye, a glow upon his face. John looked up and felt encouraged to speak. In broken tones, he poured forth the whole story — grew wild, painfully eloquent, in that frank confession of his last hour. Entangled in a secret association of loyalists, he had been led on from step to step, until a horrible and blasphemous OATH, taken amid scenes of darkness and mystery, hurried him to a purpose, which his soul beheld with shuddering. “I cannot tell their names — my feelings of love to God, loyalty to the king were horribly trifled with it is true — but I cannot reveal their names! That OATH maddened me — you behold me now, willing to pay the forfeit of my crime, eager to die and be forgotten!” With clasped hands and gasping utterance, he looked up into the face of Washington. The American Chieftain turned his face away, and leaned his arm upon the mantel. By his averted face and downcast head, you may guess the nature of his thoughts. Was he thinking of his own life, which began with a nature wild and passionate as the flowers and sun of the southern clime, and grew into ripeness with a calm, cold, stern exterior, hiding the fires that glowed within the heart? Was he thinking of his hardy boyhood, passed among the rocks and mountains of the western wilderness, and nourished into manhood through many a bitter trial? Did he, that man whose warm heart was veiled with an icy shroud — who afterwards signed with an unfaltering pen and tearful eyes the death-warrant of John Andre — did he behold amid the wrecks of a mad fanaticism which covered the murderer's soul, the tokens of a better nature, the buds of a noble manhood? For a long time he pondered there, by the hearth, while the miserable John ****, with his face growing yet more livid, awaited the words of fate. “You will be tried, sir, according to the forms of law in cases like yours provided”— such were his cold words as he turned his calm face to the murderer again — “In a moment the soldiers of my Life Guard will bear you to the camp at Valley Forge.” He left the bed-chamber with his usual measured pace. John fell upon his knees, buried his face in his hands, which rested on the chair, and tried to pray. Tried! But above him a sky of black marble seemed to spread, and as the words faltered from his lips they fell back upon his heart again like balls of living fire. “Come, sir, the guard await you,” said the voice of Washington. John started to his feet, confronted his doom, and felt — that warm, loveable Katrine quivering on his heart, her arms around his neck, her loosened hair about his face. “There, sir, before you shoot at me again, learn to be more careful in your aim.” There was a smile upon that magnificent face — something like a tear in that brilliant eye of deep rich gray. It was a painful thing to see the freed blood pouring in one impetuous torrent from John's heart to his face — to see the wonder, doubt, tremulous joy, painted there — to see the head pillowed on his shoulders, while over his uplifted arms fell the maiden's luxuriant hair. But a glorious thing it was to see that commanding form, one hand resting on the hilt of his sword, while the other shaded his eyes from the light, yet did not hide the nervous movement of his lips. It would have stirred your blood to behold that great man on his war-horse, riding forth to battle, but now it would have forced the tears in torrents from your eyes to view him, in that half-lighted chamber, shaken almost into womanish feeling, as he saw the result of his own — For giveness.

THE ENTRANCED, OR THE WANDERER OF EIGHTEEN CENTURIES: BY GEORGE LIPPARD, Author of “Jesus and the Poor.” To be published, in one volume — price 25 cents. “A story extending over the space of eighteen centuries, and destined to create a deep sensation in the reading world.” “We should say one word here of George Lippard, author of `Jesus and the Poor,' a gem which we have transferred to our own cabinet. Whether he or the world know it or not, he is a true apostle — not made such, indeed, by the laying on of any fleshly hand, whether of Priest, or Bishop, with its solemn mockery of divine right and power, but called and consecrated by the spirit of God within himself, commanding him to lift up his voice, and plead the cause of those who have no utterance for the wrongs that are crushing them — to follow directly in the footsteps of his Divine Master, however widely it may diverge from the beaten track of such as rejoice in the wearing, or in the shadow, of cassock and of band, to impersonate the good Samaritan, though Priest and Levite pass coldly and scornfully on the `other side.”' —(Univercœlum.) III. THE EMPIRE CITY; OR NEW YORK BY NIGHT AND DAY. BY GEORGE LIPPARD, Author of “The Quaker City.” One volume, splendidly illustrated, and making 250 pages. Complete for 50 cents. (Extract of a letter from a distinguished literary gentleman to the author.) “Your greatest book is the Empire City. It far surpasses your world-renowned novel, `The Quaker City.' If you finish it as you have commenced, it will be, beyond a doubt the most absorbing novel of the Age.” (From another letter.) “New York is certainly the greatest city in America. It is decidedly Metropolitan in its character. In its streets will be discovered representatives of all the classes and races which have an existence on the American Continent, mingled with many others from the Old World. Thus New York furnishes more abundant materials for a great book, than any city in the world. It is the task of the Author, in `the Empire City' to picture New York not as it seems, but as it is. He traverses its huts and palaces, pictures its scenes by Night and Day and delineates characters from North, South, East and West, who are lured to the great city by every motive that can sway the mind of man. The great question of Trinity Church, which it is said will be treated in the pages of the “Empire City” will alone make it more thoroughly and earnestly read than any work of the age. The few chapters that have been published, display all the powers of a master hand: we look for the complete work with indescribable interest.” IV. THE SEQUEL TO THE MEMOIRS OF A PREACHER. BY GEORGE LIPPARD, Author of “The Memoirs of a Preacher.” One volume. Price 25 cents. This work is an invaluable companion to the “Memoirs of a Preacher.” It traces the lives of all the characters in that work, and will excite even a deeper interest than its predecessor. Both works, the “Memoirs” and the “Sequel” will be supplied for 50 cents, in one volume, illustrated with engravings by the best Artists. V. THE LADYE ANNABEL, OR THE CHILD OF ALDARIN. BY GEORGE LIPPARD A Romance of the Middle Ages. Complete for 50 cents.</field>
