      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXIX. Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA. BELLEVIEW. I AM sometimes mortified to find the books which I recommend to your perusal, are not always applicable to the situation of an American lady. The general observations of some English books are the most useful things contained in them; the principal parts being chiefly filled with local deseriptions, which a young woman here is frequently at a loss to understand. I SEND you a little work, entitled “A Lady of Quality's Advice to her Children” which, though not altogether free from this exception, is highly worthy of your attention. A parent who is represented struggling with the distress of a lingering illness, bequeaths a system of education to her offspring. I do not recommend it to you as a Novel, but as a work that speaks the language of the heart and that inculcates the duty we owe to ourselves, to society and the Deity. DIDACTICK essays are not always capable of engaging the attention of young ladies. We fly from the laboured precepts of the essayist, to the sprightly narrative of the novelist. N Habituate your mind to remark the difference between truth and fiction. You will then always be enabled to judge of the propriety and justness of a thought; and never be misied to form wrong opinions, by the meretricious dress of a pleasing tale. You will then be capable of deducing the most profitable lessons of instruction, and the design of your reading will be fully accomplished.— HENCE you will be provided with a key to the characters of men: To unlock these curious cabinets is a very useful, as well as entertaining employment. Of those insidious gentlemen, who plan their advances towards us on the Chesterfieldian system, let me advise you to beware. A prudent commander would place a double watch, if he apprehended the enemy were more disposed to take the fort by secresy and undermining, than by an open assault. I CANNOT but smile sometimes, to observe the ridiculous figure of some of our young gentlemen, who affect to square their conduct by his Lordship's principles of politeness—they never tell a story unless it be very short—they talk of decorum and the etiquette —they detest every thing vulgar or common—they are on the rack if an old man should let fall a proverb—and a thousand more trifling affectations, the ridicule of which arises, not so much from their putting on this foreign dress, as from their ignorance or vanity in pretending to imitate those rules which were designed for an English nobleman—Unless, therefore, they have a prospect of being called by Congress to execute some foreign negociation, they ought certainly to be minding their business. THIS affectation of fine breeding is destructive to morals. Dissimulation and insincerity are connected with its tenets; and are mutually inculcated with the art of pleasing. A PERSON of this character grounds his motives for pleasing on the most selfish principle—He is polite, not for the honour of obliging you, as he endeavours to make you believe, but that he himself might be obliged. Suspect him, therefore, of insincerity and treachery, who sacrifices truth to complaisance, and advises you to the pursuit of an object, which would tend to his advantage. ALWAYS distinguish the man of sense from the coxcomb. Mr. Worthy is possessed of a good understanding, and an exact judgment. If you are united with him, let it be the study of your life to preserve his love and esteem. His amiable character is adorned with modesty and a disposition to virtue and sobriety. I never anticipate your future happiness, but I contemplate this part of his character with pleasure. But remember the fidelity of a wife alone, will not always secure the esteem of a husband; when her personal attractions do not continue to delight his eye, she will flatter his N 2 judgment. I think you are enabled to perform this, because you are solicitous to supply your mind with those amiable qualities which are more durable than beauty. When you are no longer surrounded with a slattering circle of young men, and the world shall cease to call you beautiful, your company will be courted by men of sense, who know the value of your conversation. I AM pleased with the conduct of fome agreeable girls, and the return of civility and attention they often make to the conceited compliments of a certain class of beaux. These ladies wisely consider them as the butterflies of a day, and therefore generally scorn to break them on a wheel! WHEN you are in company, where the vain and thoughtless endeavour to shew their ingenuity by ridiculing particular orders of men, your prudence will dictate to you not to countenance their abuse—The book I have just mentioned, intimates, that “there are a great many things done and said in company which a woman of virtue will neither see nor hear.”—To discountenance levity, is a sure way to guard against the encroachment of temptation; to participate in the mirth of a buffoon, is to render yourself equally ridiculous. We owe to ourselves a detestation of solly, and to the world, the appearance of it. I would have you avoid coquetry and affectation, and the observance of my maxims will never make you a prude— Pretend, therefore, should a vain youth throw out illiberal sarcasms against Mechanicks, Lawyers, Ministers, Virtue, Religion, or any serious subject, not to comprehend the point of his wit. I HAVE seldom spoken to you on the importance of Religion, and the veneration due to the characters of the Clergy. I always supposed your good sense capable of suggesting their necessity and eligibility. The Ministers of no nation are more remarkable for learning and piety than those of this country. The fool may pretend to scorn, and the irreligious to contemn, but every person of sense and reflection must admire that sacred order, whose business is to inform the understanding, and regulate the passions of mankind. Surely, therefore, that class of men, will continue to merit our esteem and affection, while virtue remains upon earth. I AM always pleased with the reasonable and amiable light in which the Clergy are placed by the author of the Guardian— “The light,” says he, “in which these points should be exposed to the view of one who is prejuced against the names, Religion, Church, Priest, or the like, is to consider the Clergy as so many Philosophers, the Churches as Schools, and their Sermons as Lectures for the improvement and information of the audience. How would the heart of Tully or Socrates have rejoiced, had they lived in a nation where the law had made provision for philosophers to read lectures of philosophy, every seventh day, in several thousands of schools, erected at the publick charge, throughout the whole country, at which lectures, all ranks and sexes, without distinction, were obliged to be present, for their general improvement?” YOU may, perhaps, think this letter too serious, but remember that virtue and religion are the foundation of education. Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXX. Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA. BELLEVIEW. You will observe, my dear friend, that most of the letters I have written to you of late, on female education, are confined to the subject of study. I am sensible of the ridicule sometimes levelled at those who are called learned ladies. Either these ladies must be uncommonly pedantick, or those who ridicule them, uncommonly ignorant—Do not be apprehensive of acquiring that title, or sharing the ridicule, but remember that the knowledge which I wish you to acquire, is necessary to adorn your many virtues and amiable qualifications. This ridicule is evidently a transatlantick idea, and must have been imbibed from the source of some English Novel or Magazine—The American ladies of this class, who come within our knowledge, we know to be justly celebrated as ornaments to society, and an honour to the sex. When it is considered how many of our countrywomen are capable of the task, it is a matter of regret that American literature boasts so few productions from the pens of the ladies. SELF complacency is a most necessary acquirement—for the value of a woman will always be commensurate to the opinion she entertains of herself. A celebrated European wit, in a letter to a lady, concenters much good advice in one short rule of conduct: “REVERENCE THYSELF.” I WAS this morning reading Swift's letter to a very young lady, on her marriage. Although this famous writer is not celebrated for delicacy or respect towards us, yet I wish some of his observations contained less truth—If you are in company, says this writer, when the conversation turns on the manners and customs of remote nations, or on books in verse or prose, or on the nature and limits of virtue and vice, it is a shame for a lady not to relish such discourses, not to improve by them, and endeavour by reading and information, to have her share in those entertainments, rather than turn aside, as is the usual custom, and consult with the woman O who sits next her, about a new cargo of fans. HE then descends to particulars, and insists on the necessity of orthography. Is it not a little hard, continues he, that not one gentleman's daughter in a thousand should be brought to read or understand her own natural tongue, or be judge of the easiest books that are written in it; as any one may find, who can have the patience to hear them mangle a Play or a Novel? IF there be any of your acquaintance to whom this passage is applicable, I hope you will recommend the study of Mr. Webster's Grammatical Institute, as the best work in our language to facilitate the knowledge of Grammar. I cannot but think Mr. Web ster intended his valuable book for the benefit of his countrywomen: For while he delivers his rules in a pure, precise, and elegant style, he explains his meaning by examples which are calculated to inspire the female mind with a thirst for emulation, and a desire of virtue. NO subject has been more exhausted than that of education. Many Utopian schemes have been delineated, and much speculation employed. When I peruse these labours, and am persuaded the intention of their authors is to promote our welfare, I feel myself prompted to a prudent and amiable demeanour; and I suppose every woman of reason and reflection feels the same inclination to virtue, and the same sensations of gratitude, in reading the works of those writers, the characteristicks of whom, are sentiment, morality and benevolence. WHAT books do you read, my dear? We are now finishing Barlow's Vision of Columbus, and shall begin upon Dwight's Conquest of Canaan in a few days. It is very agreeable to read with one, who points out the beauties of the author as we proceed. Such an one is Worthy.—Sometimes Mr. Holmes makes one of our party, and his notes and references to the ancient poets are very entertaining. Worthy is delighted with the ease and freedom with which we live here. We have little concerts, we walk, we ride, we read, we have good company—this is Belleview in all its glory! ADIEU ADIEU, my dear—I shall continue this subject no longer, though I flatter myself you would receive my hints with satisfaction, because you must be persuaded I love you, and so interest myself in your welfare—I need not add that I think your conduct worthy of you. You are such a good girl that I know not in what to direct you; for you leave me no room for advice—continue to anticipate the desires of my heart, and to secure the high opinion you have there obtained. Your friend forever!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O 2 LETTER XXXI. Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA. BELLEVIEW. If the affair of your brother and Harriot be serious, and matrimony is really on the tapis, do not fail to make me previously acquainted with it—I very much doubt the evidence of the verses—they weigh in my mind—and he is easily excused for sending them to so fine a girl as Harriot. YOUR observations on her dependence on Mrs. Francis do honour to your heart—virtue does not consist in affluence and independence—nor can it be reflected on us by the glory of our connexions—those who pride themselves on it, make but an indifferent figure; for in the estimation of all sensible people—true merit is personal. HOWEVER, my dear friend, as one who wishes for your welfare and the happiness of your family, I advise you to discourage the proposed connexion—and if you cannot undertake this disagreeable task with a certainty of success, do not fail to acquaint me of it speedily. Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXII. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. What ails my heart? I feel a void here—and yet I verge towards my happiness—for a few days makes Harriot mine—Myra says I had better not marry her. What could prompt her to use such an expression? Better not marry her. She has repeated it several times—and with too much eagerness—I give no heed to it—and yet why should it affect me in this manner? Is it an artifice to fathom the depth of my love? Such schemes are my utter aversion— it disturbs me—I hate such artifice—You cannot imagine how it touches my heart. Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXIII. Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA. BELLEVIEW. It is the duty of friends to be interested in all the concerns of one another— to join in their joys and to avert the stroke of danger. It is the duty of a centinel to give the alarm at the approach of what he may think such—and if the result does not prove to be a real evil—he has but performed his duty, and the action is meritorious.

I find my temper grow extremely irritable—my sensibility is wounded at the slightest neglect—I am very tenacious of every thing, and of every body. A PARTY was made yesterday to go on the water; I was omitted, and the neglect hurt me. I inquired the cause, and what think you is the answer? “I am no com “pany—I am asked a question and return “nothing to the point—I am absent---I am “strangely altered within a few days---I am “thinking of a different subject when I “ought to be employed in conversation---I “am extravagant in my observations---I “am no company.” THEY would persuade me that I am little better than a mad man---I have no patience with their nonsensical replies---Such non?en?ical"&gt;nonsensical replies---Such wifeacres do not deserve my pity.

      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXV. MYRA to Mrs. HOLMES. BOSTON. Your letter is filled with such ambiguous expressions, that I am utterly at a loss to discover your meaning. I HAVE, however, sounded him on the article of marriage, and the result is---he loves Harriot most passionately---and on account of my father's aversion to early marriages, will marry her privately in a few days. THE oftener I read your letter, the more I am perplexed and astonished: “YOU HAVE A TALE TO UNFOLD”---For Heaven's sake shen unfold it, before it be too late---and as you dread the consequence of keeping it secret, by disclosing it to me, you will prevent the mischief, you so much deprecate—I am all impatience. Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXVI. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. I have just left Harriot---but how have I left her? In tears. I wish I had not gone. Mrs. Francis had intrusted Harriot with some trisling commission---It was not done---she had not had time to perform it. Harriot was reprimanded— Yes! by Heaven---this Mrs. Francis had the insolence to reprimand Harriot in my presence---I was mortified---I walked to the window---my heart was on fire---my blood boiled in my veins---it is impossible to form an idea of the disorder of my nerves— Harriot's were equally agitated—Mrs. Francis saw our consusion and retired—she left P me so completely out of temper that I was forced to follow her example. I kissed away the tear from the cheek of Harriot and withdrew to my chamber. HERE let me forget what has passed—my irritability will not permit it—my feelings are too easily set in motion to enjoy long quietness—my nerves are delicately strung; they are now out of tune, and it is a hard matter to harmonize them. I FEEL that I have a foul—and every man of sensibility feels it within himself. I will relate a circumstance I met with in my late travels through Southcarolina—I was always susceptible of touches of nature. I HAD often remarked a female slave pass by my window to a spring to fetch water. She had something in her air superiour to thoe of her situation—a fire that the damps of slavery had not extinguished. AS I was one day walking behind her, the wind blew her tattered handkerchief from her neck and exposed it to my sight—I asked her the cause of the scar on her shoulder— She answered composedly, and with an earnestness that proved she-was not ashamed to declare it—“It is the mark of the whip,” said, she, and went on with the history of it, without my desiring her to proceed---“my boy, of about ten years old, was unlucky enough to break a glass tumbler---this crime was immediately inquired into---I trembled for the fate of my child, and was thought to be guilty. I did not deny the charge, and was tied up. My former good character availed nothing. Under every affliction, we may receive consolation; and during the smart of the whip, I rejoiced—because I shielded with my body the lash from my child; and I rendered thanks to the best of beings that I was allowed to suffer for him.” “HEROICALLY spoken!” said I, “may he whom you call the best of beings continue you in the same sentiments—may thy foul be ever disposed to SYMPATHIZE with thy children, and with thy brethren and sisters in calamity---then shalt thou feel every circumstance of thy life afford thee satisfaction; and repining and melancholy shall fly from thy bosom---all thy labours will become easy---all thy burdens light, and the yoke of slavery will never gall thy neck.” I WAS sensible relieved as I pronounced these words, and I felt my heart glow with feelings of exquisite delight, as I anticipated the happy time when the sighs of the slave shall no longer expire in the air of freedom. What delightful sensations are those in which the heart is interested! In which it stoops to enter into the little concerns of the most remote ramification of Nature! Let the vain, the giddy, and the proud pass on without deigning to notice them—let them cheat themselves of happiness—these are circumstances which are important only to a sentimental traveller. HALL Sensibility! Sweetener of the joys of life! Heaven has implanted thee in the breasts of his children—to soothe the sorrows P 2 of the afflicted—to mitigate the wounds of the stranger who falleth in our way. Thou regardest with an eye of pity, those whom wealth and ambition treat in terms of reproach. Away, ye seekers of power—ye boasters of wealth—ye are the Levite and the Pharisee, who restrain the hand of charity from the indigent, and turn with indignation from the way-worn son of misery:—But Sensibility is the good Samaritan, who taketh him by the hand, and consoleth him, and poureth wine and oil into his wounds. Thou art a pleasant companion—a grateful friend—and a neighbour to those who are destitute of shelter.— From thee! Author of Nature! from thee, thou inexhaustible spring of love supreme, floweth this tide of affection and SYMPATHY—thou whose tender care extendeth to the least of thy creation—and whose eye is not inattentive even though a sparrow fall to the ground.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXVIII. MYRA to Mrs. HOLMES. BOSTON. Accept my warmest acknowledgment, my good friend, for your kindness —Your letter sufficiently explains your former anxiety—it has removed all ambiguities. YOUR servant entered hastily with the letter—and gave it me with evident tokens of its containing a matter of importance.—My father was present—I broke it open, not without agitation—I read it—but the shock was too severe—it fell from my hands, and I sunk into the chair. MY sainting was not of any duration. I opened my eyes and found my father supporting me—but the idea of Harriot was still engraven deeply in my heart—I inquired for my sister—the tear rolled down his cheek—it was a sufficient answer to my inquiry—He said nothing—there was no necessity of his saying a word. COULD I ask him to explain your letter? No—my heart anticipated his feelings— the impropriety struck me at once. “You have a tale to unfold.” Do not delay to unfold it. Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXIX. Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA. BELLEVIEW. I readily undertake to give you a sketch of the history of Harriot. Her mother's name was Maria Fawcet; her person I yet recollect, and forgive me if I drop a tear of pity at the recital of her misfortunes. MY mother and Mrs. Holmes were remarkable friends, and the intimacy, you know, was maintained between the two families. I was on a visit with my mother when the destiny of Maria led her to Belleview. I was frequently there during her illness—and was with her in her lasst moments. IT was the custom of Mrs. Holmes to walk in the garden towards the close of the day. She was once indulging her usual walk, when she was alarmed by the complaints of a woman which came from the road. Pity and humanity were ever peculiar characteristicks of my amiable parent---She hastened to the place from whence the sound issued and beheld a young woman, bathed in tears, sitting upon the ground. She inquired the cause of her distress, with that eager solicitude to relieve, which a sight so uncommon would naturally occasion. It was sometime before the distressed woman could return an intelligible answer, and then she with difficulty proceeded: “Your goodness, Madam, is unmerited---you behold a stranger, without home---without friends---and whose misery bears her down to an untimely grave---Life, truly is a blessing---but my life is become burthensome, and were the Almighty this moment to command me to the world of spirits, methinks I could gladly obey the summons, and rejoice in the stroke which bade me depart from sorrow and the world.” Moderate your grief, my dear woman, repine not at the will of Providence, nor suffer yourself to despair, however severe your misfortunes. THE unfortunate woman was at length prevailed on to accompany Mrs. Holmes into the house, she partook of some refreshment and retired to sleep. In a few days she appeared to be better; but it was a temporary recovery; she then told her story, with frequent interruptions, in substance as follows:— History of Maria. “I DATE the rise of my misfortunes,” said Maria, “at the beginning of my acquaintance with the Honourable Mr. Harrington.—But for his solicitations I might Q still have lived in peace—a sister would not have had occasion to blush at the sound of my name—nor had a mother's pillow been steeped in tears, too sondly prone to remember a graceless but repenting child---We lived happily together in the days of my father, but when it pleased Providence to remove him, we no longer asserted our pretentions to that rank of life which our straitened finances were unable to continue— A young woman in no eligible circumstances, has much to apprehend from the solicitations of a man of affluence. I am now better persuaded of this truth, than I ever was before—for this was my unhappy situation---I always entertained a predilection for Mr. Harrington—he urged his passion with protestations of sincerity and affection ---he found my heart too slightly guarded ---he strove—he triumphed. “—MUST I proceed!— “A SMILING female was the offspring of our illicit connexion—Ah! my little Harriot!” continued Maria, as she wiped away a tear from her eye, “mayest thou enjoy that happiness which is denied to thy mother.” “OUR amour was not fated to last long— I discovered his gay temper to be materially altered—he was oftentimes thoughtful and melancholy, and his visits became suddenly shorter, and less frequent. “I AFTERWARDS thought this change of conduct owing to jealousy—for he once asked me if a gentleman had called upon me —I persisted in avowing my abhorrence of his ungenerous suspicion---He left me abruptly, and I saw nothing of him after. “A STROKE so unexpected fell heavy on my heart—it awakened me to the state of misery into which my imprudence had hurried me.---What recompense could I expect from my Seducer?---He had been married two years---From the inflexibility of his temper I had little to hope, and I formed a determination of leaving town, for I had now indubitable testimony of his affection being estranged from me—half frantick, I immediately set out---but whither I knew not---I walked with precipitation until Providence directed me to your hospitable door: To your goodness, Madam, I am indebted for prolonging my existence a few days: For amidst the kindness and civilities of those around me, I feel myself rapidly verging towards the grave. I prepare myself for my approaching fate---and daily wait the stroke of death with trembling expectation.” SHE wrote to Mr. Harrington about a week before her decease---I transcribe the Letter:— “The Hon. Mr. Harrington. “TO the man for whom my bleeding heart yet retains its wonted affection, though the author of my guilt and misery, do I address my feeble complaint---O! Harrington, I am verging to a long eternity---and Q 2 it is with difficulty I support myself while my trembling hand traces the dictates of my heart. Indisposed as I am---and unable as I feel to prosecute this task---I however collect all my powers to bid you a long ---a final farewell. “OH! Harrington, I am about to depart ---for why should. I tarry here? In bitter tears of sorrow do I weep away the night, and the returning day but augments the anguish of my heart, by recalling to view the sad sight of my misfortunes. And have I not cause for this severe anguish, at once the sorrow and disgrace of my family? —Alas! my poor mother!—Death shall expiate the crime of thy daughter, nor longer raise the blush of indignation on thy glowing cheek.—Ought I not therefore, to welcome the hand of death? “BUT what will become of my poor helpless infant, when its mother lies forgotten in the grave? Wilt thou direct its feet in the path of virtue and rectitude?—Wilt thou shelter it from the ride blasts of penury and want?—Open your heart to the solicitude of a mother—of a mother agonizing for the future welfare of her child. Let me intreat you to perform this request —by the love which you professed for thy Maria—by her life which you have sacrificed. “AND wilt thou not drop a tear of pity in the grave of thy Maria?—I know thy soul is a soul of sensibility; but my departure shall not grieve thee—no, my Harrington, it shall not wrest a sigh from thy bosom— rather let me live, and defy the malice and misery of the world—But can tenderness— can love atone for the sacrifices I have made?—Will it blot out my errours from the book of memory? Will love be an excuse for my crime, or hide me from the eye of the malignant—No, my Harrington, it will not. The passion is unwarrantable. Be it thine, gentle Amelia—be it thine to check the obtruding sigh, and wipe away the tear from his face—for thou art his wife, and thy soul is the seat of compassion—But—for me— “Farewel—farewel forever! Maria.” SHE survived but a short time—and frequently expressed a concern for her child— but Mrs. Holmes quieted her fears by promising to protect it. She accordingly made inquiry after it—and it is the same Harriet who was educated by her order, and whom she afterwards placed in the family of Mrs. Francis. THE assurances of my mother were like balm to the broken hearted Maria—“I shall now,” said she, “die in peace.” THE following is a copy of a letter written by the Rev. Mr. Holmes to the Hon. Mr. Harrington:— “BELLEVIEW. “SIR, “WE have a scene of distress at our house peculiarly pathetick and affecting, and of which you, perhaps, are the sole author—You have had a criminal connexion with Miss Fawcet—you have turned her upon the world inhumanly—but chance—rather let me say Providence, hath directed her footsteps to my dwelling, where she is kindly entertained, and will be so, as long as she remains in this wilderness world, which is to be, I fear, but a short time---And shall she not, though she hath been decoyed from the road that leadeth to peace, long life and happiness--- shall she not, if she return with tears of repentance and contrition, be entitled to our love and charity? Yes---this is my doctrine ---If I behold any child of human nature distressed and forlorn, and in real want of the necessities of life, must I restrain or withhold the hand of charity---must I cease to recal the departing spirit of them that are ready to perish, until I make diligent inquiry into their circumstances and character? Surely, my friend, it is a duty incumbent on us by the ties of humanity and fellow feeling, and by the duty imposed on us by our holy religion, equally to extend the hand of relief to all the necessitous—however they may be circumstanced in the great family of mankind. “THE crime of Maria is not the blackest in the annals of human turpitude; but however guilty she might have been, the tears of penitence do certainly make atonement therefor. “THUS much have I thought proper to say in vindication of my conduct---in sheltering under my roof a poor wanderer—who hath strayed, but not wantonly, and who hath now happily returned. “ONE would imagine, there was little necessity of making such a vindication to you; but my sentiments always flow from the abundance of my heart, and I am willing the whole world should judge of those which influence my conduct—Now, though some men, whose charity is contracted, and who may be denominated prudes in virtue, might deem wrongfully of my attention to the calamity of this frail woman—yet let me appeal to the hearts and understandings of all men, and these in particular, if I have erred, whether it be not an errour on the side of humanity. Would to God such amiable errours were more frequent!—In as much, my friend, as there is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, I may say with assurance that I have felt an emanation of this heavenly joy animate my heart, in beholding this woman delighting to steer her course heavenward. “FROM the unhappy condition of Maria, I have been led to reflect on the mischievous tendency of SEDUCTION. Methinks I view the distressing picture in all its horrid colours.— R “BEHOLD the youthful virgin arrayed in all the delightful charms of vivacity, modesty and sprightliness—Behold even while she is rising in beauty and dignity, like a lily of the valley, in the full blossom of her graces, she is cut off suddenly by the rude hand of the Seducer. Unacquainted with his beseness and treachery, and too ready to repose confidence in him—she is deluded by the promises and flattery of the man who professes the greatest love and tenderness for her welfare:—But did she understand the secret villainy of his intentions—would she appear thus elate and joyous? Would she assent to her ruin? Would she subscribe her name to the catalogue of infamy? Would she kiss the hand of the atrocious dastard, already raised to give the final wound to her reputation and peace? “O! WHY is there not an adequate punishment for this crime, when that of a common traitor is marked with its deserved iniquity and abhorrence! “IS it necessary to depicture the slate of this deluded young creature after her fall from virtue? Stung with remorse, and frantick with despair, does she not fly from the face of day, and secrete her conscious head in the bosom of eternal forgetfulness? Melancholy and guilt transfix her heart, and she sighs out her miserable existence—the prey of poverty, ignominy and reproach! Lost to the world, to her friends, and to herself, she blesses the approach of death in whatever shape he may appear, that terminates a life, no longer a blessing to its possessour, or a joy to those around her. “BEHOLD her stretched upon the mournful bier!—Behold her silently descend to the grave!—Soon the wild weeds spring afresh round the little hillock, as if to shelter the remains of betrayed innocence—and the friends of her youth shun even the spot which conceals her relicks. “SUCH is the consequence of SEDUCTION, but it is not the only consequence. Peace and happiness fly the nuptial couch which is unattended by love and fidelity. The mind no longer enjoys its quiet, while it ceases to cherish sentiments of truth and gratitude. The sacred ties of connubial duty are not to be violated with impunity; for though a violation of those ties may be overlooked by the eye of justice, the heart shall supply a monitor, who will not fail to correct those, who are hardy enough to burst them asunder.—I am, &amp;c. “W. Holmes.” TO this Letter, Mr. Harrington returned the following Answer. Hon. Mr. Harrington to the Rev. Mr. Holmes. “PERMIT me, my ever honoured friend, to return you thanks for your late favours—need I add—an acknowledgment for your liberality? No—your heart supplies a source of pleasure which is constantly nourished by your goodness and universal charity.— “THE picture you have exhibited of a ruined female is undoubtedly just, but that the R 2 rude spoiler has his share of remorse is equally so—The conclusion of your letter is a real picture of the situation of my heart. “PERHAPS you was always ignorant of the real motives that influenced me, and gave a particular bias to my conduct—At an early period of my life, I adopted a maxim, that the most necessary learning was a knowledge of the world, the pursuit of which, quadrating with a volatility of disposition, presented a variety of scenes to my heated imagination. The eclat of my companions gratifying my vanity and increasing the gale of passion, I became insensibly hurried down the stream of dissipation. Here I saw mankind in every point of view—from the acme of the most consummate refinement, to the most adject stage of degradation. I soon became a ready proficient in the great school of the world—but an alteration of conduct was soon after necessary—I was compelled to it, not so much from the world's abhorrence of a dissolute course of life, as the dictates of my own heart—It was, indeed, my policy to flatter the world, and exhibit a fair outside—for I was in love with Amelia—My licentious amour with Maria was secret—she was affectionate and tender—her manners were pleasing, but still I was unhappy.— “MY career of dissipation, however alluring it struck my vitiated fancy, left little satisfaction on the mind—Reflection had its turn—and the happiness I had promised myself in a connexion with the amiable Amelia, I fully enjoyed in our marriage. A course of uninterrupted tranquillity ensued, but it was of short duration. The volatility of my temper, and the folicitude of my old associates, induced me at subsequent periods to fall again into my old vagaries. The taverns frequently found me engaged in meannesses derogatory to the character of a gentleman. These things I perceived affected the foul of Amelia—she was all meekness, gentleness and compassion, and she never once upbraided me with my illiberal conduct: But let concealment, like a worm in the bud, Feed on her damask cheek. “BLESSED he that power who has implanted within us that consciousness of reproach, which springs from gentleness and love!—Hail sensibility! Ye eloquent tears of beauty! that add dignity to human nature by correcting its foibles—it was these that corrected my faults when recrimination would have failed of success—it was these that opened every avenue of contrition in my heart, when words would have dammed up every fluice of repentance. “IT was now I appeared fully sensible that my conduct had hitherto been a course of disorder, and that systems of reformation, however well planned, had been overturned by the breath of adulation, before they had been thoroughly carried into execution—that I had been drifting upon a sea of inconsistency, without exercising my judgment; like a ship without a rudder, buffetted on the bosom of the ocean, the sport of winds and waves. “THE criminality of my connexion with Maria appeared with the most aggravated circumstances; it stung me with remorse— and I instantly determined, however fevere the conflict, to tear her from my bosom—to see her no more.—But how was I to inform her of it?—In what manner was I to bring about such a task?—Maria must be sacrificed to the happiness of Amelia. This was all I had to perform—it was a short lesson, but it was a hard one for me to execute. “WITH this determination, however, I entered the apartment of Maria—Duty to Amelia and gratitude to Maria interchangeably agitated me—the contention was dubious—but duty prevailed, and I adhered to my former resolution—yet how was I to tell her this would be the last visit?—Conscious she had ever acted in conformity to my wishes —how could I accuse her, without accusing myself?—I threw out a few inconsiderate, and ungrateful hints of jealousy, and left the room abruptly. The feelings of Maria must have been injured—but however her sensibility was affected, mine was doubly so; I felt for her—I felt for our infant, and these feelings were added to the afflictions which had already burst upon my devoted head. A few days consideration, however, convinced me of the impropriety and ingratitude of my behaviour to Maria—I hastened to tell her of it—to place her in a situation that should screen her from penury and malice—and to make provision for the child— but, she was not to be found. I was informed that she had suddenly disappeared, and that a countryman had, by her order, called and taken away the child but a few hours before. This information burst upon my head like the voice of sudden thunder—I stood motionless, but my agitation was too violent to be of any long duration.— A natural tear I shed, but wip'd it soon. “IT was your goodness, and the humanity of your family, that sheltered the wretched Maria, and provided for the helpless Harriot —Your feelings are your reward. “FROM all the variegated scenes of my past life, I daily learn some new lesson of humanity. Experience hath been my tutor— I now take a retrospect of my past conduct with deliberation, but not without some serious reflection: Like a sailor escaped from shipwreck, who sits safely on the shore and views the horrors of the tempest; but as the gale subsides, and the waves hide their heads in the bosom of the deep, he beholds with greater concern the mischief of the storm and the dangers he hath escaped. From what innate principle does this arise, but from the God within the mind!—I assert it for the honour of human nature, that no man, however dissolute but comes back to the hour of reflection and solemn thoughtfulness S —when the actions that are passed return upon the mind, and this internal monitor sits in judgment upon them, and gives her verdict of approbation or dislike. “HE who listens to its call, views his character in its proper light—I have attended to its cry, and I see my deformity—I recal my mispent time, but in vain—I reflect on the misery of Maria, and I curse my temerity— I reflect on the state into which I have plunged a once happy female, and am eager to apply a speedy remedy, but this is vain also: Can I restore her that virtue—that innocence —that peace, of which I have unmanfully robbed her?—Let us leave the melancholy subject.— “I WILL not so far supersede the fruit of your benevolence, as to presume to offer you any other recompense, than my sincere prayers for your happiness. “I have the honour to be, “With respect, “Your &amp;c. “J. Harrington.” THE disorder of Maria was fatal and rapid—but I hasten to the last scene of her life—it has, though I was young, made an impression on my mind that time cannot efface. I went to her, as she was seated on the bed—virtue and harmony were blended in her aspect—she was serene and composed— and her mien, while it expressed a consciousness of superiour worth and dignity, exhibited in one view, a striking picture of the grandeur of the human soul—patient, though afflicted—of a spirit broken, and borne down by severe distress, yet striving to surmount all, and aspire to heaven. In what words shall I paint to you, my dear Myra, her heroism and greatness of mind? “Weep not for me,” said she, perceiving my emotion— “Death has nothing shocking to me—I have familiarized myself to his terrours—I feel the gradual decay of mortality; and waiting with confidence in the father of mercy, I am prepared to resign this mortal breath— I resign it in firm assurance of the soul's blessed immortality—Death I view as freeing me from a world which has lost its relish—as opening new scenes of happiness—But a few moments,” continued she, clasping my hand, “and the scene of life is closed forever---Heaven opens on my soul---I go where all tears shall be wiped away---I welcome death as the angel of peace.”—She uttered these words with a placid smile of resignation---her head sunk down on the pillow---and the next minute she was an angel. “SOUL of the universe!” exclaimed my father-in-law—“there flew the gentlest spirit that ever animated human dust---Great were thy temptations---sincere thy repentance. If some human infirmity fell to thy lot, thy tears, dear shade, have washed out thy guilt forever!”</field>

The sacred ties of connubial duty are not to be violated with impunity; for though a violation of those ties may be overlooked by the eye of justice, the heart shall supply a monitor, who will not fail to correct those, who are hardy enough to burst them asunder.—I am, &amp;c. “W.

      <field name="fulltext">Hon. Mr. Harrington to the Rev. Mr. Holmes. “PERMIT me, my ever honoured friend, to return you thanks for your late favours—need I add—an acknowledgment for your liberality? No—your heart supplies a source of pleasure which is constantly nourished by your goodness and universal charity.— “THE picture you have exhibited of a ruined female is undoubtedly just, but that the R 2 rude spoiler has his share of remorse is equally so—The conclusion of your letter is a real picture of the situation of my heart. “PERHAPS you was always ignorant of the real motives that influenced me, and gave a particular bias to my conduct—At an early period of my life, I adopted a maxim, that the most necessary learning was a knowledge of the world, the pursuit of which, quadrating with a volatility of disposition, presented a variety of scenes to my heated imagination. The eclat of my companions gratifying my vanity and increasing the gale of passion, I became insensibly hurried down the stream of dissipation. Here I saw mankind in every point of view—from the acme of the most consummate refinement, to the most adject stage of degradation. I soon became a ready proficient in the great school of the world—but an alteration of conduct was soon after necessary—I was compelled to it, not so much from the world's abhorrence of a dissolute course of life, as the dictates of my own heart—It was, indeed, my policy to flatter the world, and exhibit a fair outside—for I was in love with Amelia—My licentious amour with Maria was secret—she was affectionate and tender—her manners were pleasing, but still I was unhappy.— “MY career of dissipation, however alluring it struck my vitiated fancy, left little satisfaction on the mind—Reflection had its turn—and the happiness I had promised myself in a connexion with the amiable Amelia, I fully enjoyed in our marriage. A course of uninterrupted tranquillity ensued, but it was of short duration. The volatility of my temper, and the folicitude of my old associates, induced me at subsequent periods to fall again into my old vagaries. The taverns frequently found me engaged in meannesses derogatory to the character of a gentleman. These things I perceived affected the foul of Amelia—she was all meekness, gentleness and compassion, and she never once upbraided me with my illiberal conduct: But let concealment, like a worm in the bud, Feed on her damask cheek. “BLESSED he that power who has implanted within us that consciousness of reproach, which springs from gentleness and love!—Hail sensibility! Ye eloquent tears of beauty! that add dignity to human nature by correcting its foibles—it was these that corrected my faults when recrimination would have failed of success—it was these that opened every avenue of contrition in my heart, when words would have dammed up every fluice of repentance. “IT was now I appeared fully sensible that my conduct had hitherto been a course of disorder, and that systems of reformation, however well planned, had been overturned by the breath of adulation, before they had been thoroughly carried into execution—that I had been drifting upon a sea of inconsistency, without exercising my judgment; like a ship without a rudder, buffetted on the bosom of the ocean, the sport of winds and waves. “THE criminality of my connexion with Maria appeared with the most aggravated circumstances; it stung me with remorse— and I instantly determined, however fevere the conflict, to tear her from my bosom—to see her no more.—But how was I to inform her of it?—In what manner was I to bring about such a task?—Maria must be sacrificed to the happiness of Amelia. This was all I had to perform—it was a short lesson, but it was a hard one for me to execute. “WITH this determination, however, I entered the apartment of Maria—Duty to Amelia and gratitude to Maria interchangeably agitated me—the contention was dubious—but duty prevailed, and I adhered to my former resolution—yet how was I to tell her this would be the last visit?—Conscious she had ever acted in conformity to my wishes —how could I accuse her, without accusing myself?—I threw out a few inconsiderate, and ungrateful hints of jealousy, and left the room abruptly. The feelings of Maria must have been injured—but however her sensibility was affected, mine was doubly so; I felt for her—I felt for our infant, and these feelings were added to the afflictions which had already burst upon my devoted head. A few days consideration, however, convinced me of the impropriety and ingratitude of my behaviour to Maria—I hastened to tell her of it—to place her in a situation that should screen her from penury and malice—and to make provision for the child— but, she was not to be found. I was informed that she had suddenly disappeared, and that a countryman had, by her order, called and taken away the child but a few hours before. This information burst upon my head like the voice of sudden thunder—I stood motionless, but my agitation was too violent to be of any long duration.— A natural tear I shed, but wip'd it soon. “IT was your goodness, and the humanity of your family, that sheltered the wretched Maria, and provided for the helpless Harriot —Your feelings are your reward. “FROM all the variegated scenes of my past life, I daily learn some new lesson of humanity. Experience hath been my tutor— I now take a retrospect of my past conduct with deliberation, but not without some serious reflection: Like a sailor escaped from shipwreck, who sits safely on the shore and views the horrors of the tempest; but as the gale subsides, and the waves hide their heads in the bosom of the deep, he beholds with greater concern the mischief of the storm and the dangers he hath escaped. From what innate principle does this arise, but from the God within the mind!—I assert it for the honour of human nature, that no man, however dissolute but comes back to the hour of reflection and solemn thoughtfulness S —when the actions that are passed return upon the mind, and this internal monitor sits in judgment upon them, and gives her verdict of approbation or dislike. “HE who listens to its call, views his character in its proper light—I have attended to its cry, and I see my deformity—I recal my mispent time, but in vain—I reflect on the misery of Maria, and I curse my temerity— I reflect on the state into which I have plunged a once happy female, and am eager to apply a speedy remedy, but this is vain also: Can I restore her that virtue—that innocence —that peace, of which I have unmanfully robbed her?—Let us leave the melancholy subject.— “I WILL not so far supersede the fruit of your benevolence, as to presume to offer you any other recompense, than my sincere prayers for your happiness. “I have the honour to be, “With respect, “Your &amp;c. “J.

      <field name="fulltext">S 2 LETTER XL. Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA. BELLEVIEW. Having presented you with several observations on Seduction, I think it will not be mal apropos to consider the question in another point of view, and discover how a woman may be accessary to her own ruin---It is hardly worth while to contend about the difference between the meaning of the terms accessary and principal. The difference, in fact, is small; but when a woman, by her imprudence, exposes herself, she is accessary; for though her heart may be pure, her conduct is a tacit invitation to the Seducer. EDUCATED in the school of luxury and pride, the female heart grows gradually torpid to the fine feelings of sensibility—the blush of modesty wears off—the charms of elegant simplicity fade by degrees—and the continual hurry of dissipation supersedes the improvement of serious reflection. Reflection is a kind of relaxation from frolicking— it encourages the progress of virtue, and upholds the heart from sinking to depravity. WE may lay it down as a principle, that that conduct which will bear the test of reflection, and which creates a pleasure in the mind from a consciousness of acting right, is virtuous: And she whose conduct will not bear this test, is necessarily degenerating, and she is assenting to her destruction LET a lady be liberal or even magnificent, according to her circumstances or situation in life; but let the heart remain uncorrupt, let her not be contaminated by wealth, ambition or splendour. She may then take a happy retrospect of her conduct—her heart cannot upbraid her—and the suffrage of her own mind is a convincing proof that she has not strayed from the path of virtue. HAPPY they who can thus reflect—who can recal to view the scenes that are passed, and behold their actions with reiterated satisfaction—they become ambitious of excelling in everything virtuous, because they are certain of securing a continual reward: For as a mighty river fertilizes the country through which it passes and encreases in magnitude and force until it empty itself into the ocean: So virtue fertilizes or improves the heart, and gathers strength and vigour by continual progression, until it centre in the consummation of its desires. DAZZLED by the glitter of splendour, and unmindful of the real charms of economy and simplicity, the female heart sighs for the enjoyment of fashion, and flutters to join the motley train of pleasure. But how is it deluded by empty deceptions! Like the fruit which sprang up in the infernal regions, beautiful to the eye, but which left upon the taste bitter ashes, and was followed by repentance—A great quantity of this kind of fruit presents itself to my rashly judging sex; and it frequently happens that their hearts have as little inclination to resist the temptation, as our general parent to refuse the fatal apple. WE do not rouse to our aid fortitude to enable us to surmount the temptation, but yield ourselves to a kind of voluntary slavery. Hence it is observable, that a woman is often unhappy in the midst of pleasures—and petulent without cause—that she is trifling in matters of the highest importance; and the most momentous concern is considered futile, as whim and caprice may chance to dictate. THE progress of female luxury, however flow it may appear, unless timely checked, works with infallible and destructive advances. The rule we at first adopted might perhaps answer this check; for by the examination there recommended, we behold the dangers of a continuation of such conduct— Ruin and contempt, the invariable concommitants of vice and immorality, proclaim their denunciations on a prosecution of it. LET us examine the gradual steps, and the consequence of female luxury.—A desire to be admired is the first. Behold a woman surrounded by her worshippers, receiving the sacrifice of adulation—what was given her at first as compliment, she now demands as her due. She finds herself disappointed, and is mortified. The first desire still predominating, she attaches herself to the votaries of pride, who direct their feet in the paths of extravagance and irreligion. Thus sunk into effeminacy and meanness, she forfeits her virtue rather than her pride. Thus terminates the career of a woman, whose mind is debilitated, and whose life is expended in the pursuit of vanity. IT is said of some species of American serpents, that they have the power of charming birds and small animals, which they destine for their prey. The serpent is stretched underneath a tree—it looks stedfastly on the bird—their eyes meet to separate no more —the charm begins to operate—the fascinated bird flutters and hops from limb to limb, till unable any longer to extend its wings, it falls into the voracious jaws of its enemy: This is no ill emblem of the fascinating power of pleasure. Surrounded with temptation, and embarrassed in her circumstances, a woman of dissipation becomes less tenacious of her honour—and falls an easy prey to the fascinating power of theSEDUCER. HAVING traced to you, my dear Myra, the rise, advancement and termination of pleasure and pride in the female heart, it appears almost unnecessary to remark that this conduct cannot bear the test of reflection and serious examination. We may, however, observe on the contrary, that a woman who advances a few steps, often hurries on still further to prevent thought. This bars the way to a return to that conduct which can give pleasure on recollection. She behaves to herself as the populace did formerly to women suspected of witchcraft—they were T tied neck and heels and thrown into the river; if they swam they were hung for witches—if they sank they were acquitted of the crime, but drowned in the experiment: So when we only suspect our hearts of an errour, we plunge still deeper into the sea of dissipation, to prevent the trial of that conduct which impartial reason and judgment would approve. notwithstanding I give this instance as an encouragement for virtue; yet in all those I have mentioned is a woman accessary to her ruin. DO not imagine, my dear Myra, that I mean to argue against all pleasure—Many of us set out on a principle of false delicacy and destructive rivalship; we cannot behold a fine woman without wishing to appear finer. A laudable emulation in the conduct of all women is extremely praiseworthy—it stimulates them in the line of their duty—increases vivacity and good humour; and ambition, thus directed and pursued, I beg leave to designate a female virtue, because it is productive of the most happy consequences. BUT it sometimes happens that particular virtues loose themselves in their neighbouring vices, and this laudable emulation degenerates into destructive rivalship. A GENTEEL, handsome woman, deservedly shares the esteem and admiration of all men; but why should this esteem and admiration, justly paid to merit, give us disquiet? the answer is ready. That desire to be admired, so predominant in all females, by degrees works itself into the ruling passion, and precludes from the mind the particular virtue of emulation; for why a woman who merits the love of the world, should draw on her the disapprobation of many of her own sex, can be accounted for, by no other principle, than the mean, pitiful passion of envy. THIS may possibly give rise to defamation. It is astonishing how this practice prevails among a few persons—because it is known by experience, to prove subversive of its very intention.—The arrows of envy recoil upon herself. HOW foolish must that woman appear who depreciates the merit of another, that she may appear unrivalled! She raises up the dykes of ill nature, and inundates the land with a flood of scandal, but unhappily drowns herself in the event. I LEAVE it to the result of your observation, my dear Myra, whether the woman who is first to develope her stores of defamation, and through false emulation, the first to traduce a woman of real merit and virtue, is not also the first who becomes a scandal to herself, and consequently the first that is contemned. HOW opposite are the pursuits and rewards of her who participates in every rational enjoyment of life, without mixing in those scenes of indiscretion which give pain on recollection!—Whose chymical genius leads T 2 her to extract the poison from the most luxuriant flowers, and to draw honey even from the weeds of society. She mixes with the world seemingly indiscriminately—and because she would secure to herself that satisfaction which arises from a consciousness of acting right, she views her conduct with an eye of scrutiny. Though her temper is free and unrestrained, her heart is previously secured by the precepts of prudence—for prudence is but another name for virtue. Her manners are unruffled, and her disposition calm, temperate and dispassionate, however she may be surrounded by the temptations of the world. Adieu!</field>

It is impossible to communicate the distressed situation of Har U riot---Expression is inadequate to give you an idea of our meeting---I called her my friend---my sister---She always loved me--- but joy and affection gave way to passion--- Her speech refused its office--- Sorrow in all its pomp was there, Mute and magnificent without a tear. SHE had gained a sister---she had lost a lover---a burst of joy would suddenly break from her, but it was of short duration---and was succeeded by pangs of exquisite distress ---nature was unable to support it, and she sainted under the weight of the severe conflict.

HOW WAS I TO KNOW YOU WERE MY BROTHER?—Yes!

WHAT is human happiness? The prize for which all strive, and so few obtain; the more eagerly we pursue it, the farther we stray from the object: Wherefore I have determined within myself that we increase in misery as we increase in age—and if there are any happy they are those of thoughtless childhood. I THEN viewed the world at a distance in perspective. I thought mankind appeared happy in the midst of pleasures that flowed round them. I now find it a deception, and am tempted sometimes to wish myself a child again. Happy are the dreams of infancy, and happy their harmless pursuits! I saw the ignis satuus, and have been running after it, but now I return from the search. I return and bring back disappointment. As I reflect on these scenes of infantine ignorance, I feel my heart interested, and become sensibly affected—and however sutile these feelings may appear as I communicate them U 2 to you—they are feelings I venture to affert which every one must have experienced who is possessed of a heart of sensibility.

      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XLIX. The Hon. Mr. HARRINGTON to the Rev. Mr. HOLMES. BOSTON. Accumulated sorrows continue to break over my devoted head. Harriot is at times deprived of her reason, and we have no expectation of her recovery—my son is deeply affected—he seems strangely disordered. REVOLVING in my mind all thefe things, and the unhappy affair that led to them, the whole train of my past life returned fresh upon my mind. Pained with the disagreeable picture, and oppressed with the weight of my afflition, I funk down to fleep: These circumstances had so strongly impressed my imagination that they produced the following Dream—My blood is chilled with horrour as I write. METHOUGHT I suddenly found myself in a large, open field, waste and uncultivated— here I wandered in a solitary manner for some time—gries seized my heart at the awful appearance of the place, and I cried aloud—“How long shall I travel here, alone and friendless—a dusky mist swims before my fight, and the obscure horizon seems only to inclose this dismal wild!” Having advanced a few steps, I thought a light at a distance appeared to my doubtful view. Faint with fatigue, I approached it, and had the satisfaction to behold a person of the most benign aspect—a quiet ferenity was painted on his brow, and happiness ineffable beamed from his divine countenance—Joy leaped in my bosom, and in the ecstacy of passion I endeavoured to clasp the blessed spirit to my heart; but it vanished in my embrace. “TEACH me, blessed shade,” said I, with a trembling voice—“ teach me to find the habitations of men—What do I here?— Why am I doomed to explore the barren bosom of this baleful desert?” “This,” returned the spirit, in a voice, which, while it commanded veneration and love, struck awe and terrour into my soul—“this is not the habitation of the sons of mortality—it is the place appointed to receive the souls of all men, after they have resigned the bodies they animated on earth. Those who have violated the laws of reason, humanity, religion, and have dishonoured their God, here meet the punishment due to their crimes. “ATTEND me, therefore, and view the condition of those thoughtless souls, who, a few days ago, were upon earth immerfed in pleasure, luxury and vice—Regardless of futurity, and unprepared for their eternal summons to another world—and who persisted in the delight of their own eyes in opposition to the divine law, and deaf to the voice of reclaiming virtue. These, the sons of folly and riot, are smitten by the angel of death, while they are yet drinking of the bowl of vice—while the words of blasphemy yet well upon their tongues. And when their unhappy spirits sink to these infernal regions, their surviving companions rehearse their funeral panegyricks—the praise of one is, that he could drink the longeft— the merit of another, that he could sing a good song—a third secures his same by being excellent in mimickry and bussoonery— How unhappy must he be, who leaves no other testimony of his usefulness behind him! “HOW different is the fate of the good man: While upon earth his life is employed in the cause of virtue—The happiness he bestows on those around him is reflected back with tenfold reward; and when he takes rank in that happy place, where there is fulness of joy, and leaves the world of mankind, what numbers are joined in the general concern for his loss—The aged, while they prepare for the fame journey, delight to dwell on his good actions—the virgin strews flowers on his grave, and the poet consumes the midnight oil to celebrate his virtues.” THERE was so much benignity in every word and action of my attendant, that I found myself imperceptibly attached to him. My attention to his discourse had prevented me from observing the progress we had made —for we had arrived at a place encircled with high walls—a great gate, at the command of my guide, instantly flew open— “Follow me,” said he—I tremblingly obeyed.— W MY ears were instantaneously filled with the faint cries of those here doomed to receive the rewards of their demerits. Looking earnestly forward, I beheld a group of unhappy wretches—I observed a person who was continually tormenting them—he held in one hand a whip, the lashes of which were composed of adders, and the stings of scorpions; and in the other a large mirrour, which, when he held up to the faces of the tormented, exhibited their crimes in the most flagrant colours, and forced them to acknowledge the justness of their punishment. “These,” said my guide, “who are scourged with a whip of scorpions, and who start with horrour at the reflection of their deeds upon earth, are the fouls of the Gambler— the Prodigal—the Duelist, and the Ingrate. “THOSE whom you see yonder,” continued he, “those wasted, emaciated spirits, are the souls of the Envious—they are doomed to view the most beautiful fruit, which they can never taste, and behold pleasures which they can never enjoy. This punishment is adjuded them because most of those vile passions, by which men suffer themselves to be ruled, bring real evil, for promised good. “FOR this reason the allwise Judge hath ordered the same passions still to inflame those ghosts, with which they were possessed on earth—Observe you despicable crew!— behold the sin of Avarice!—those fordid ghosts are the souls of Misers—Lo! they eye their delightful bags with horrid pleas. ure; and with a ghastly smile, brood over their imaginary riches. Unable to carry their wealth about with them, they are confined to one spot, and in one position. This infernal joy is the source of their tortures, for behold them start at every sound, and tremble at the flitting of a shade. Thus are they doomed to be their own tormentors—to pore over their gold with immortal fear, apprehension, and jealousy, and to guard their ideal wealth with the tears of care, and the eyes of eternal watchfulness. “BEHOLD here,” continued my guide; “the miserable division of Suicides!”— “Unhappy they!” added I, “who, repining at the ills of life, raised the sacrilegious steel against their own bosoms! How vain the reiterated wish to again animate the breathless clay—to breathe the vital air— and to behold the cheering luminary of Heaven!”—“Upbraid me not—O my father!” cried a voice—I looked up, and thought my son appeared among them—but immediately turning from so shocking a spectacle, I suddenly beheld my once loved Maria—“O delight of my youth! do I behold thee once more!—Let me hide my sorrows in thy friendly bosom.” I advanced towards her—but she flew from me with scorn and indignation—“O speak! Maria! speak to me!” She pointed with her finger to a group of spirits, and was out of sight in a moment. W 2 “LET me,” said my conductor, “prepare you for a more dreadful sight.” The increasing melancholy, and affecting gloom of the situation, forboded something terrifying to my soul—I looked toward the place where Maria had pointed, and saw a number of souls remote from any division of the unhappy. In their countenances were depicted more anguish, sorrow and despair—I turned my head immediately from this dreadful sight, without distinguishing the nature of their torments. Quivering with horrour, I inquired who they were—“These,” answered my guide, with a sigh, “are the miserable race of SEDUCERS.—Repentance and shame drive them far from the rest of the accursed. Even the damned look on them with horrour, and thank fate their crimes are not of so deep a die.” HE had hardly finished, when a demon took hold of me, and furiously hurried me in the midst of this unhappy group—I was so terrified that it immediately roused me from my sleep.— EVEN now, while I write to you, my good friend, my hand trembles with fear at the painful remembrance—Yet —'Twas but a dream, but then So terrible, it shakes my very foul.— Farewel!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER L. HARRIOT to HARRINGTON. BOSTON. Must i then forget the endearments of the lover, and call you by the name of brother? But does our friendship remain upon this foundation? Is this all that unites us? And has there subsisted nothing more tender—a sentiment more voluntary in our hearts? My feelings affirm that there has. At the hour of our first interview I felt the passion kindle in my breast: Insensible of my own weakness, I indulged its increasing violence and delighted in the flame that fired my reason and my senses. Do you. remember our walks, our conversations, our diversions?—The remembrance of these things fill my mind with inconceivable torture—they seem to reproach me with unmerited criminality—I deprecate, I detest all these scenes of gaity and frivolity—yet I have preserved my innocence and my virtue—what then have I to deprecate, what have I to detest? ALAS! how have we been forming schemes of happiness, and mocking our hearts with unsubstantial joys. Farewel! farewel! ye gilded scenes of imagination. How have we been deluded by visionary prospects, and idly dwelt upon that happiness which was never to arrive. How fleeting have been the days that were thus employed!—when anticipation threw open the gates of happiness, and we vainly contemplated the approach of bliss;—when we beheld in reversion, the pleasures of life, and fondly promised ourselves, one day to participate in them;—when we beheld in the magick mirrour of futurity, the lively group of loves that sport in the train of joy. We observed in transports of delight the dear delusion, and saw them, as it were, in bodily form pass in review before us; as the fabled hero views the region of præexistant spirits, and beholds a race of men yet to be born. SUCH was our hope, but even this fairy anticipation was not irrational. We were happy in idea, nor was the reality far behind. And why is the vision vanished? O! I sink, I die, when I reflect—when I find in my Harrington a brother—I am penetrated with inexpressible grief—I experience uncommon sensations—I start with horrour at the idea of incest—of ruin—of predition. HOW do I lament this fatal discovery, that includes the termination of a faithful love! I think of him to whom I have resolved to be eternally constant—and ah! how often have I resolved it in my heart. I indulge, in idea, the recollection of his caresses—of his protestations, and of his truth and sincerity—I become lost in a wilderness, and still I travel on, and find myself no nearer an escape. I cherish the dear idea of a lover—I see the danger and do not wish to shun it, because, to avoid it, is to forget it—And can I, at one stroke, erase from my mind the remembrance of all in which my heart used to delight? Ah! I have not the fortitude—I have not the virtue, to “forget myself to marble.” On the contrary, I strive no longer to remember our present connexion. I endeavour to forget—I curse the idea of a brother—my hand refuses to trace the word, and yet —The name appears Already written; blot it out my tears! AH, whence this sorrow that invests my soul! This gloom that darkens—this fire of impassioned grief, that involves all my thoughts! why do I rave, and why do I again abandon myself to despair! Come, O Harrington! be a friend, a protector, a brother—be him, on whom I could never yet call by the tender, the endearing title of parent. I will reverence him in whom all the charities of life are united—I will be dutiful and affectionate to you, and you shall be unto me as a father—I will bend on the knee of respect and love, and will receive your blessing. WHY did you go away so soon? Why leave me when I was incapable of bidding you adieu? When you pressed my cheek with the kiss of love, of fraternal affection, what meant its conscious glow? What meant the ebullition of my veins, the disorder of my nerves, the intoxication of my brain, the blood that mantled in my heart? My hand trembled, and every object seemed to swim X before my doubtful view---Amidst the struggle of passion, how could I pronounce the word---how could I call you by the title of brother. True---I attempted to articulate the found, but it died upon my tongue, and I fank motionlefs into your arms. —ALLIED by birth, and in mind, and fimilar in age---and in thought still more intimately connected, the fympathy which bound our fouls together, at first fight, is lefs extraordinary. Shall we any longer wonder at its irrefistible impulfe?---Shall we strive to oppofe the link of nature that draws us to each other? When I reflect on this, I relapse into weakness and tenderness, and become a prey to warring passions. I view you in two distinct characters: If I indulge the idea of one, the other becomes annihilated, and I vainly imagine I have my choice of a brother or— I am for a while calm---but alas! how momentary is that calmness; I dwell with rupture on what fancy has reprefented; but is the choice regulated by virtue? Is it prompted by reafon? I recollect myself, and endeavour to roufe my prudence and fortitude; I abhor my conduct, and wish for obscurity and forgetfulness. Who can bear the torment of fluctuating passion? How deplorable is the contest? The head and the heart are at variance, but when Nature pleads, how feeble is the voice of Reason? Yet, when Reason is heard in her turn, how criminal appears every wish of my heart? What remorse do I experience? What horrours surround me? Will my feeble frame, already wasted by a lingering decline, support these evils? Will the shattered, frail bark outride the tempest, and will the waves of affliction beat in vain? Virtue, whose precepts I have not forgotten, will assist me---if not to surmount, at least to suffer with fortitude and patience. OH! I fear, I fear my decaying health— If I must depart, let me beseech you to forget me—I know the strength of your passion, and I dread the fatal confequences my departure may occasion you. ONCE more let me intreat you, my dear friend, to arm yourself with every virtue which is capable of fustaining the heaviest calamity. Let the impetuofity of the lover's passion be forgotten in the undisturbed quietness of the brother's affection, and may all the bleffings that life can supply be yours—Seek for content, and you will find it, even though we should never meet again in this world. Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LI. MYRA to Mrs. HOLMES. BOSTON. The curtain is dropped, and the scene of life is forever clofed—THE LOVELY HARRIOT IS NO MORE. X 2 SHE is fit to appear in Heaven, for her life was a fcene of purity and innocence—If there is any confolation to be felt by a survivor, it is in the reflection of the amiable qualities of the deceafed. My heart shall not cease to cherish her idea, for she was beautiful without artifice, and virtuous without affection. See! there all pale and dead she lies; Forever flow my streaming eyes— There dwelt the fairest—lovliest mind, Faith, sweetnefs, wit together join'd. Dwalt faith and wit and sweetness there? O! view the change, and drop a tear. MY brother is exceedingly agitated—He will never support this disastrous stroke— Nothing can attract his attention—nothing allay his grief—but it is the affliction of reason and not of weakness—God grant that it prove not fatal to him. Adieu!—Adieu!—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LII. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. She is gone—she is dead—she who was the most charming, the most gentle, is gone—You may come—you may desire to behold all that was lovely—but your eyes will not fee her. YES! I raved—I was distracted—but now I am calm and dispassionate—I am smooth as the surface of a lake—I shall fee her again. WHEN our spirits are disencumbered of this load of mortality, and they wing their slight to the celestial regions, shall we not then know those who were dear to us in this world? Shall we not delight in their society, as we have done in this state of existence? Yes— certainly we shall—we shall find them out in Heaven—there alone is happiness—there shall I meet her—there our love will not be a crime—Let me indulge this thought —it gives a momentary joy to my heart—it removes the dark mist that swims before my eyes—it restores tranquillity; but the more I reflect on this thought—the more I long to be there—the more I detest this world and all it contains. I figh to fly away from it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LIII. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. Ingratitude is a predominant principle in the conduct of man. The perfidious —, who owes to me his reputation and fortune, and with whom I intrusted a great part of my property, has deceived me. This affair will materially retard my business. TO be unfortunate in trade is not worth a figh—to receive inattention and incivility does not merit a frown; but Ingratitude—it is this that cuts to the quick. Yet I freely give him my pity; for what man, who considered for a moment the inconfistency of the human heart, would hurl the thunderbolt of indignation at the head of an ingrate? What an important little thing is man! he contrives to overreach his neighbour, and mount to the enjoyment of riches, ambition and splendour; but remembers not the period of enjoyment—that his life is a day, and his space a point! NATURALISTS inform us of infects whose term of existence is confined to a few hours —What is the business and importance of such a life? WOULD not a being, whose circle of living is immensity of ages, inquire with equal propriety, “What is the importance of man— What actions can he perform—What happiness can he enjoy, whose insignificant life is circumscribed to seventy years?”— In this point of view I behold the tinfel, the vanity and noise of the world, and the little plots and cunning artifices of mankind to cheat and ruin one another. INGRATITUDE, then, is constitutional, and inseparable from human nature, but it ought not to fill us with surprize, because it is no new discovery—It has ever been invariably the characteristick of man. Is not the page of antiquity distained with the blood of those who ought to have received honour and adoration? Behold the brilliant race of the world's benefactors: Consider their benevolent actions, and regard their ungrateful return—these benefactors, who have been sent from heaven to inform and entertain mankind, to defend the world from the arm of tyranny, and to open the gates of salvation, have been despised, and banished, and poisoned and crucified. BEHOLD the support of the Roman power, the invincible Belifarius! who protected his country from the ravage of the Huns, and displayed the Roman eagle in every quarter of the globe! Behold him fall a sacrifice to malice, to faction and ingratitude! Behold him cast out by the country he had defended, and for which he had wasted his life to protect and honour, and left alone to deplore his unfortunate condition, when he was old, and blind, and naked and miserable! UNFORTUNATE is the man who trusts his happiness to the precarious friendship of the world—I every day become more of a misanthrope, and see nothing to increase my desire of living, but your esteem and affection. I want advice, but am too proud to let the world know I am weak enough to be under obligation to any one else. THAT you may never want friends or advice, is the sincere prayer of Your &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Y LETTER LIV. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. All the scenes of my past life return fresh upon my memory. I examine every circumstance as they pass in review before me—I see nothing to cause any disagreeable or unwelcome sensations—no terrour upbraids me—no reproaching conscience stings my bosom as I reflect on the actions that are past. With her I expected happiness—I have expected a vain thing—for there is none—She is gone—gone to a far country —she is preparing a place for me—a place of unutterable bliss—But ah! an immeasurable gulph lies between us—Who can tell the distance that separates us? What labour— what toil—what pain must be endured in traversing the thorny paths that lead to her blessed abode?—And will she not receive me into those happy regions with as much joy— with as sincere a welcome—if I cut short my journey?—And will not the Eternal Dispenser of Good, pardon the awful deed that frees me from this world of misery—the deed by which I obtrude myself into his divine presence? WHY must I wait the lingering hand of the grifly messenger to summon me to the world above?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LV. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. Am I a child that I should weep? —I have been meditating on the cause of my calamities—Why did my father love Maria —or rather, why did I love their Harriot? Cure on this tyrant custom that dooms such helpless children to oblivion or infamy! Had I known her to have been my sister, my love would have been regular---I should have loved her as a sister---I should have marked her beauty---I should have delighted in protecting it. I should have observed her growing virtues---I should have been happy in cherishing their growth. But alas! She is gone—and I cannot stay---I stand on the threshold of a vast eternity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LVI. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. I am determined to quit this life. I feel much casier since my determination. The step must not be taken with rashness. I must be steady---calm---collected---I will endeavour to be so.— HER eager solicitation---the anxiety she always expressed for me—When I think she is no more, it wrings my heart with grief, and fills my eyes with tears— —I MUST go— THE idea chills me---I am frozen with horrour---cold damps hang on my trembling Y 2 body---My soul is filled with a thousand troubled sensations—I must depart--- it must be so---My love for thee, O Harriot! is dearer than life---Thou hast first fat out---and I am to follow.— WERE it possible that I could live with her, should I be happy? Would her presence restore peace and tranquillity to my disordered mind? An no! it never would here—it never would. I will fly to the place where she is gone---our love will there be refined--- it will be freed from all criminality—I will lay my sorrows before her—and she shall wipe away all tears from my eyes. WHEN the disembodied spirit flies above— when it leaves behind the senseless clay, and wings its flight---it matters not with me what they do with his remains.

      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LVII. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. The longer I live, and the more I see of the misery of life—the more my desire of living is extinguished. What I formerly esteemed trifles, and would not deign to term misfortunes, now appear with a formidable aspect—though I once thought them harmless, and innoxious to my peace, they assume new terrours every day.—But is not this observation general? It is—It is thus every son of human nature, gradually wishes for death, and neglects to seek for, and improve those comforts, which by diligent search there is a possibility of attaining. am I to reason from analogy? I know what has been—the afflictions I have felt; but what is the prospect before me? The path is darkened by mists— Puzzled in mazes, and perplex'd with errours— Who is there hardy enough to try its difficulties? Is not the view horrible! My pains and anxieties have been severe—those, which, if I live, I shall suffer, may be yet more so —This idea sinks me to despair. AS a thing becomes irksome to us, our detestation is always encreased—Whatever object is disagreeable, we pine and sicken until it is moved out of sight. Life growing upon one in this manner—increasing in horrour— with continual apprehension of death— a certainty of surviving every enjoyment, and no prospect of being delivered from suspense—it is intolerable—he will assuredly be tempted to terminate the business with his own hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LVIII. WORTHY to HARRINGTON. BELLEVIEW. You argue as if your reason were perverted—Let your mind be employed, and time will wear out these gloomy ideas; for it is certainly a truth, that the love of life in creases with age—Your letters, therefore, are predicated on the most erroneous principles. REMEMBER the story of the old man, who had been buried in a dungeon the greater part of his life, and who was liberated at an advanced age. He viewed, once more, the light of the sun, and the habitations of men —he had come into a new order of beings, but found their manners distasteful—In the midst of the sunshine of the world, he remembered the prison, where he had wasted his life, and he sighed to be again immured within its walls. SUCH is our passion for life; we love it because we know it; and our attachment becomes the more riveted, the longer we are acquainted with it—Our prison grows familiar —we contemplate its horrours—but however gloomy the walls that surround us, there is not one but sets a full value on his dreary existence—there is not one but finds his partiality for his dungeon increase, in proportion to the time he hath occupied it—for among the race of human beings confined to this narrow spot—how few are they who are hardy enough to break their prison? LET us watch over all we do with an eye of scrutiny—the world will not examine the causes that give birth to our actions—they do not weigh the motives of them—they do not consider those things which influence our conduct—but as that conduct is more or less advantageous to society, they deem it madness or wisdom, or folly or prudence—Remember this— Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LIX. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. You are egregiously mistaken, argue as you will.—My perceptions are as clear as any one's—The burden that is at first heavy and inconvenient, galls us as we proceed—it soon becomes intolerable, we sink under its weight, and lie gasping in the publick way long before night. AS to the world—who strives to please it, will be deservedly rewarded—he will reap his labour for his pains—Let it judge of my conduct. I despise its opinion—Independency of spirit is my motto—I think for myself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LX. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. How vain is the wish that sighs for the enjoyment of worldly happiness. Our imagination dresses up a phantom to impose on our reason: As Pygmalion loved the work of his own hand—so do we fall in love with the offspring of our brain. But our work illudes our embrace—we find no substance in it—and then fall a weeping and complain of disappointment. Miserable reasoners are we all. Z WHY should I mourn the loss of Harriot any longer? Such is my situation—in the midst of anxiety and distress, I complain of what cannot be remedied.—I lament the loss of that which is irretrievable: So on the sea-beat shore, the hopeless maid, unmindful of the storm, bewails her drowned lover.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LXI. WORTHY to HARRINGTON. BELLEVIEW. I thank you for your letters, but I wish you had something better for the subject of them—the sad repetition of your feelings and sorrows, pains me exceedingly— I promise to be with you soon—perhaps before you can receive this letter. WHATEVER concerns my friend, most sensibly affects me—You, Harrington, are the friend of my heart, and nothing has so much grieved me as the story of your misfortunes. IT is a maxim well received, and seems to be admitted an article in the moral creed of mankind, “that the enjoyments of life do not compensate the miseries.” Since, then, we are born to suffer, and pain must attend us in all the stages of our journey, let us philosophically welcome our companion. The most eligible plan we can adopt, is to be contented in the condition that Providence hath assigned us. Let us trust that our burden will not be heavier than we can bear—When we adopt this plan, and are sensible we have this trust, our lesson is complete—we have learned all—we are arrived to the perfection of sublunary happiness. DO not think I am preaching to you a mere fermon of morality—let me impress your mind with the folly of repining, and the blessing of a contented mind. LET me intreat you not to puzzle your brain with vain speculations—if you are disposed to argue, do not put foolish cases that never existed—take the light of facts, and reason from them. WHEN we are surrounded with the miseries of life—the baseness of false friends—the malice of enemies—when we are inveloped in those anxious fears, the result of too much sensibility, human nature feels a degree of oppression, which, without a manly exertion of reason and this practical philosophy, would be intolerable. I have heard you mention St. Evremond, as a philosopher of this kind. Arm yourself with his prudence and fortitude—he, though in exile—though reduced almost to penury, and labouring under the disadvantages of a bad constitution, lived to be a very old man; he established a course of rational pleasures—for when the mind is employed, we regret the loss of time—we become avaricious of life. WHEN misfortunes come upon us without these consolations, it is hard, I acknowledge, Z 2 to buffet the storm—it is then human frailty is most apparent—there is nothing left to hope—Reason is taken from the helm of life—and Nature—helpless, debilitated Nature—lost to herself, and every social duty, splits upon the rocks of despair and suicide. We have seen several examples of this—By exploring, and therefore shunning the causes, let us avoid the catastrophe. THE pensive and melancholy will muse over the ordinary accidents of life, and swell them, by the power of imagination, to the heaviest calamities. Hence we find a treacherous friend will sensibly affect some men, and a capricious mistress will destroy a real lover: Hence people in misfortune frequently construe the slightest inattention into neglect and insult, and deem their best friends false and ungrateful. The sting of ingratitude deeply pierces the heart of sensibility. THE passions and affections which govern mankind are very inconsistent. Men, confined to the humble walks of life, sigh for the enjoyment of wealth and power, which, when obtained, become loath some— The mind unaccustomed to such an easy situation, is discontented, and longs to be employed in those things in which it was formerly exercised. THE greatest rulers and potentates become unhappy—they wish for the charms of solitude and retirement, which, when attained, become more irksome than their former condition —Charles the Fifth, of Spain, resolved to taste the pleasures of a recluse life, by abdicating the throne—he soon found his imagination had deceived him, and repented of the step he had taken. This lazy life, when compared to the business and grandeur of a court, became tasteless and insipid.— “The day,” says a historian, “he resigned his crown to his son, was the very day in which he repented making him such a present.” IT is a great art to learn to be happy in the state in which we are placed—I advise you to mingle in the concerns of your acquaintances—be cheerful and undisturbed, nor give yourself up to those gloomy ideas, which tend only to make you more wretched —If such obtrude themselves, avoid being alone—I had rather be a dupe to my imagination than sacrifice an hour's easiness to my sensibility or understanding. Determine to be happy, and you will be so— God be with you!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LXII. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. When we seek for diversion in any place, and there is nothing to be found that we wish, it is certainly time to depart. TOMORROW I go—There is nothing here that can calm the tumult of my foul—I fly from the fight of the human countenance—I fly from the face of day—I fly from books—Books that could always cheer me in a melancholy moment, are now terrifying—They recal scenes to my recollection that are past—pleasant scenes that I am never more to enjoy. They present pictures of futurity—of gloomy futurity—I just opened a book, and these are the words that I read:—“The time of my fading is near, “and the blast that shall scatter my leaves. “Tomorrow shall the traveller come, he “that saw me in my beauty shall come; “his eyes will search the field, but they will “not find me.” THESE words pierce me to the quick— they are a dismal prospect of my approaching fate. TOMORROW I shall go—But ah! whither?— O! MY friend, when we find nothing we desire in this world, it is time to depart. To live is a disgrace—to die is a duty. Farewel!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LXIII. WORTHY to Mrs. HOLMES. BOSTON. I ARRIVED in town last evening—you desired me to write you a statement of affairs as I should find them here— and of my marriage with the amiable Myra —I promised to obey—but how little do we know of the termination or consequence of the most probable event! I SAW my beloved—her eyes were yet heavy and smarting with weeping for the death of Harriot—and this, once the house of joy and cheerfulness, is turned into the house of mourning. My unfortunate friend had just then fallen into a calm sleep, and it was impossible to see him—it was what I very much desired—but it was the wish of the family that I should desisst for the present— he had not slept the evening before—he had been heard walking across his chamber all the night, with little intermission, oftentimes talking to himself in a passionate tone of voice. THIS melancholy account deeply affected me—and I parted from my beloved, praying Heaven to give her consolation, and to be the support of my disordered friend. IT is with difficulty I bring myself to the serious and painful employment of being the informer of unwelcome tidings—my heart feels the wound—vainly it tells me my friend is no more—my hand reluctantly traces—my friend—my Harrington is no more. EARLY this morning I was surprised with a visit from a gentleman, whom I had formerly seen at Myra's—it was the same neighbour who informed Harrington of his affinity to Harriot—he found a difficulty in his utterance—he told me, with trembling lips, my young friend Harrington was dead— “He has killed himself,” said I—he asked me if I had heard the news—I told him my heart presaged it. &amp; WHEN any uncommon event happens to us, we often have a prefentiment of it—The circumstances of his death are these:—At midnight the gentleman heard the report of the pistol, and went into the house—he found the unhappy youth weltering in his blood— ew signs of life remained—the ball had entered his brain—the surgeon came, but in a few hours he was cold. A few friends were requested to attend—and this gentleman had called upon me, by defire of Myra. IT is not possible to describe the distrefs of the family and connexions—I shall leave it to your imagination. A LETTER that he had written for me, laid unfealed upon the table, and The Sorrows of Werter was found lying by its side, I send you the letter---it appears to have been written at intervals, and expresses the disorder and agitation of his mind. Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ETTER LXIV. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. Harriot is dead—and the world to me is a dreary defert---I prepare to leave it---the satal pistol is charged---it lies on the table by me, ready to perform its duty---but that duty is delayed till I take my last farewel of the best of friends. YOUR letter is written with the impetuosity of an honest heart; it expresses great sincerity and tenderness. I THANK you for all your good advice— it comes too late—O Worthy! she is dead ---she is gone---never to return, never again to cheer my heart with her smiles and her amiable manners---her image is always before me---and can I forget her?---No!--- She is continually haunting my mind, impressing the imagination with ideas of excellence---but she is dead---all that delighted me is become torpid---is descended into the cold grave. With thee Certain my refolution is to die; How can I live without thee—how forego Thy converfe sweet, and love so dearly join'd, To live again in these wild woods forlorn? loss of thee Will never from my heart—no! no!—I feel The link of nature draw me. From thy state Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. THOU hast fat out on a long journey— but you shall not go alone—I hasten to overtake thee. My refolution is not to be diverted—is not to be shaken—I will not be afraid—I am inexorable— —I HAVE just seen my father—he is dejected—fullen grief is fixed on his brow— he tells me I am very ill—I looked at Myra —she wiped her face with her handkerchief —perhaps they did not imagine this was the last time they were to behold me. SHE mentioned the name of Worthy, but my thoughts were differently engaged. She repeated your name, but I took no heed of it.—Take her, my Worthy—Myra is a good girl—take her—comfort her. Let not my departure interrupt your happiness—perhaps &amp; 2 it may for a short time. When the grass is grown over my grave, lead her to it, in your pensive walks—point to the spot where my ashes are deposited—drop one tear on the remembrance of a friend, of a brother—but I cannot allow you to be grieved— grieve for me! Wretch that I am—why do I delay— —I WISH I could be buried by the side of her, then should the passenger who knows the history of our unfortunate loves, say—“ Here lies Harrington and his Harriot—in their lives they loved, but were unhappy—in death they sleep undivided.”— Gaurdian spirits will protect the tomb which conceals her body—the body where every virtue delighted to inhabit.— DO not judge too rashly of my conduct— let me pray you to be candid—I have taken advantage of a quiet moment, and written an Epitaph—If my body were laid by her's, the inscription would be pertinent. Let no one concerned be offended at the moral I have chosen to draw from our unfortunate story. —MY heart sinks within me—the instrument of death is before me—farewel! farewel!—My soul sighs to be freed from its confinement—Eternal Father! accept my spirit—Let the tears of sorrow blot out my guilt from the book of thy wrath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LXV. WORTHY to Mrs. HOLMES. BOSTON. We have surmounted the performance of the last scene of our tragedy, with less difficulty and distress than I imagined. Great numbers crouded to see the body of poor Harrington; they were impressed with various emotions, for their sympathizing sorrow could not be concealed—Indeed a man without sensibility exhibits no sign of a soul. I was struck with admiration at the observations of the populace, and the justness of the character they drew of the deceased. “Alas!” said one—“poor youth, thou art gone. Thou wast of a promising genius, of violent passions, thou wast possesied of a too nice sensibility, and a dread of shame. It is only such an one who would take the trouble to kill himself. Ah! poor well natured, warm hearted, hot headed youth—how my heart bleeds for you! We consider thee as the dupe of Nature, and the sacrifice of Seduction.”—The old father hears this, and becomes overwhelmed with shame and sorrow. THE jury which sat upon the body of our friend, after mature consideration, brought in their verdict SUICIDE. The rigour of the law was not executed—the body was privately taken away, and I saw it deposited by the side of his faithful Harriot. I SEND you inclosed a copy of the Monumental Inscription, as written by Harrington. I found it with many loose papers. It contains the story of our unfortunate friends, and a profitable moral is deduced from it. THOUGH a few weeks begin to spread a oalm over our passions, yet the recollection of our misfortunes will sometimes cause a momentary agitation, as the ocean retains its swell, after the storm subsides. Adieu! Monumental Inscription. THOU who shalt wander o'er these humble plains, Where one kind grave their hapless dust contains, O pass not on—if merit claim a tear, Or dying virtue cause a sigh sincere. Here rest their heads, consign'd to parent earth, Who to one common father ow'd their birth; Unknown Unknown this union—Nature still presides. And Sympathy unites, whom Fate divides. They see—they love—but heaven their passion tries Their love sustains it, but their mortal dies. Stranger! contemplate well before you part, And take this serious counsel to thy heart Does some fair female of unspotted fame, Salute thee, smiling, with a father's name, Bid her detest the fell Seducer's wiles, Who smiles to win—and murders as he smiles. If ever wandering near this dark recess, Where gaurdian spirits round the ether press; Where, on their urn, celestial care descends, Two lovers come, whom fair success attends, “O'er the pale marble shall they join their heads, “And drink the falling tears each other sheds “Then sadly say, with mutual pity moved, “0! may we never love as these have loved.” The END.</field>
