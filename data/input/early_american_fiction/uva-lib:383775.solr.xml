      <field name="fulltext">THE MIDNIGHT QUEEN; OR, LEAVES FROM NEW-YORK LIFE BY GEO. LIPPARD, ESQ. CHAPTER I. [Note to the Reader.—The leaf of “New-York Life,” which we are about to unclose in the narrative entitled “The Midnight Queen,” is a dark and bitter page torn from the book of society. Too dark, too bitter for fiction, it can only be excused from the fact, that it is a true history, written principally by the main personage of the narrative, in her own way—a sad and harrowing autobiography. The quiet atmosphere which imbues the first portions of the narrative will not appear tame or uninteresting, when it is contrasted with the dark realities of the sequel. The moral of the “Midnight Queen,” if it can be stated in a few words, may be thus condensed:—The utter perversion of the best faculties of the heart by the fear of poverty and its fathomless miseries, conjoined with the love of wealth for its enjoyments and luxuries.] “My childhood's home! Oh! is there in all the world a phrase so sweet as this —“My childhood's home?” Others may look back to childhood, and be stung with bitter momories, but my childhood was the heaven of my life. As from the hopeless present I gaze back upon it, I seem like a traveller half way up the Alps, surrounded by snow, and clouds, and mist, looking back upon the happy valley, which, dotted with homes, and rich in vines and flowers, smiles in the sunshine far below. My childhood's home was very beautiful. It was a two-storied cottage, situated upon an eminence, its white front and rustic porch half hidden by the horse-chesnut trees, which in the early summer had snowy blossoms among their deep-green leaves. Behind the cottage arose a broad and swelling hill, which, fringed with gardens at its base, and crowned on its summit by a few grand old trees, standing alone against the sky, was in summer time clad along its entire extent with a garment of golden wheat. Beneath the cottage flowed the Neprehaun, a gentle rivulet, which wound among abrupt hills—every hill rich in foliage, and dotted with homes —until it lost itself in the dark waves of the Hudson. Yes, the Hudson was there, grand and beautiful, and visible always from the cottage porch, the Palisades rising from its opposite shore into heaven, and the broad bay of Tapoan Zee glistening in sunlight to the north. Oh! that scene is before me now. The cottage with its white front, half hidden by broad green leaves intermingled with white blossoms—the hill which rose behind it, golden with wheat—the Neprehaun below, winding among the hills, now in sunshine, now in shadow—the Hudson, with its vast bay, and the sombre wall, which rose into the sky from its western shore; it is before me now, with the spring blossoms, the voices, the sky, the very air of my childhood's days. In this home I found myself at the age of thirteen. I was the pupil and the charge of the occupant of the cottage, a retired clergyman, the Rev. Thomas Walworth, who, having grown gray in the active service of his Master, had come there to pass his last days in the enjoyment of competence and peace. Even now, as in the day when I left him forever, I can see his tall form bent with age, and clad in black, his mild pale face, with hair as white as snow—I can hear that voice, whose very music was made up of the goodness of a heart at peace with God and man. When I was thirteen, myself, the good clergyman and an aged woman—the housekeeper—were the only occupants of the cottage. His only son was away at college. And when I was sixteen, my mother, who had placed me in the care of the clergyman years before, came to see me. I shall never forget that visit. I was sitting on the cottage porch—it was a June day—the air was rich with fragrance and blossoms; my book was on my knee, when I heard her step in the garden walk. She was tall and very beautiful, and richly clad in black, and her dark attire shone with diamonds. Very beautiful, I say, although there were threads of silver in her brown hair, and an incessant contraction of her dark brows, which gave a look of anxiety or pain to her face. As she came up the garden walk, pushing aside her veil of dark lace, I knew her, although I had not seen her for three years. Her presence was strange to me, yet still my heart bounded as I saw her come. “Well, Frank,” she said, as though it was but yesterday since I had seen her, “I have come to see you”—she kissed me warmly on the lips and cheeks— “Your father is dead! my child.” A tear stood in her dark eye, a slight tremor moved her lip—that was all. My father dead! I can scarcely describe the emotions which these words caused. I had not seen my father for years.— There was still a memory of his face present with me, coupled with an indistinct memory of my early childhood, passed in a city of a foreign land, and a dim vision of a voyage upon the ocean. and at my mother's words, there came up the laughing face and sunny hair of my brother Gulian, who had suddenly disappeared, about the time my parent returned from Paris, and just before I had been placed in the charge of the good clergyman. These mingling memories arose at my mother's words, and although the good clergyman stood more to me in the relation of a father than my own father, still I wept bitterly as I heard the words, “Your father is dead! my child.” My mother, who seemed to me like one of those grand rich ladies of whom I had read in story books, seated herself beside me on the cottage porch. “You are getting quite beautiful, Frank,” she said, and lifted my sun-bonnet, and put her hand through the curls of my hair, which was black as jet. “You will be a woman soon.” She kissed me, and then, as she turned away, I heard her mutter these words, which struck me painfully, although then I could not understand them—“A woman! with your mother's beauty for your dowry, and your mother's fate for your future!” The slight wrinkle between her brows grew deeper as she said these words: “You will be a woman, and must have an education suitable to the station you will occupy,” continued my mother, drawing me gently to her, and surveying me earnestly. “Now, what do they teach you here? She laughed as I gravely related the part which good old Alice, the housekeeper, took in my education. Old Alice taught me all the details of housekeeping; to sew, to knit, the fabrication of good pies, good butter, and good bread; the mystery of the preparation of various kinds of preserves; in fact, all the details of housekeeping, as she understood it. And the good old dame, with her high cap, clear bright little eye, sharp nose, and white apron string with a bundle of keys, always concluded her lessons with a mysterious intimation, that saving the good Mr. Walworth only, all the men in the world were monsters more dangerous than the bears which ate up the bad children who mocked at Elijah. Laughing heartily, as she heard me gravely enter into all these details— which I concluded with, “You see, mother, I'm quite a housekeeper already!”—she continued: “And what does he teach you, my dear?” The laughter which animated her face was succeeded by a look of vague curiosity, as I began my answer. But as I went on, her face became sad, and there were tears in her eyes. My father (as I had learned to call the good clergyman) taught me to read, to write and cypher. He gradually disclosed to me, (more by his conversation than through the medium of books,) the history of past ages, the wonders of the heavens above me, the properties of the plants and flowers that grew in my path. And oftentimes, by the bright wood fire in winter, or upon the porch under the boughs, in the rich twilight of the summer evening—while the stars twinkled through the leaves, or the Hudson glistened in the lights of the rising moon—he had talked to me of God— of His love for all of us, His providence watching the sparrow's fall, His mercy reaching forth its almighty arms to the lowest of earth-stricken children—of the other world, which stretches beyond the shores of the present, not dim and cloud-shadowed, but rich in the sunlight of eternal love, and living with the realities of a state of being in which there shall be no more sickness, or pain, and tears shall be wiped from every eye, and all things be made new —of the holy mother watching over her holy child, while the stars shone in upon his humble bed in the manger—of that child, in early boyhood, sitting in the Temple, confounding grave men, learned in the logic of the world, by the simple intuition of a heart filled with the presence of God—of the way of life, led by that mother's child, when thirty years had set the seal of the divine manhood on his brow—how, after the day's hard travel, he stopped to rest at the cottage home of Martha and Mary—how he took up little children and blessed them— how the blind began to see, the deaf to hear, the dead to live, at sound of his voice—how, on the calm of evening, in a modest room, he took his Last Supper with the Twelve, John resting on his bosom, Judas scowling in the background—how, amid the cedars of Gethsemane, at dead of night, while his disciples slept, he went through the unalterable agony alone, until an angel's hand wiped the sweat of blood from his brow, —how he died upon the felon's tree, the heaven black above him, the earth beneath him dark with the vast multitude, —and how, on the clear Sabbath morn, he rose again, and called the faithful woman who had followed him to the sepulchre by the name which his mother bore, spoken in the old familiar tone, “Mary!”—how he walked the earth in bodily form eighteen hundred years ago, shedding the presence of God around him; and even now, he walked it still in a spiritual body, shedding still upon sin-stricken and sorrowing hearts, the presence and love of God the Father. Lessons such as these the good clergyman, my father as I called him, taught me, instructing me always to do good and lead a life free from sin, not from fear of damnation or hell, but because goodness is growth, a good life is happiness. A flower shut out from the light is damned; it cannot grow. An evil life here or hereafter is in itself damnation; for it is want of growth, paralysis or decay of all the higher sentiments and nobler faculties. As, in my own way, and with such words as I could command, I recounted the manner in which the good clergyman educated me, my mother's face grew sad and tearful. She did not speak for some moments; her gaze was downcast, and through her long dark eyelashes tears began to steal. “A dream,” she muttered,—“only a dream! Did he know mankind, and know but a portion of their unfathomable baseness, he would see the impossibility of making them better; would feel the necessity of an actual hell, black as the darkest that a poet ever fancied.” As she was thus occupied in her own thoughts, a step—a well-known step— resounded on the garden walk, and the good clergyman advanced from the wicket gate to the porch. Even now, I see that pale face, with the white hair and large clear eyes! He advanced and took my mother cordially by the hand, and was much affected when he heard of my father's death. My mother thanked him warmly for the care which he had taken of her child: “This child will be a woman soon, and she must be prepared to enter upon life with all the accomplishments suitable to the position which she will occupy,” continued my mother. “I wish her to remain with you, until she is ready to enter the great world. But she must have proper instruction in music and dancing. She must not be altogether a wild country girl when she goes into society. But, however, my dear Mr. Walworth, we will talk of this alone.” Young as I was I could perceive that there was a mystery about my mother, her previous life or present position, which the good clergyman did not feel himself called upon to penetrate. She took his arm, and led him into the cottage, and they conversed for a long time alone, while I remained upon the porch, buried in a sort of dreamy reverie, and watching the white clouds as they sailed along the summer sky. “I shall be absent two years.” I heard my mother's voice, as, leaning on the good clergyman's arm, she again came forth upon the porch. “See that when I return, in place of this pretty child, you will present to me a beautiful and accomplished lady.” She took me in her arms and kissed me, while Mr. Walworth exclaimed: “Indeed, my dear Madam, I can never allow myself to think of Frances leaving this home, while I am living. She has been with me so long, is so dear to me, that the very thought of parting with her is like tearing my heart-strings.” He spoke with undisguised emotion; my mother took him warmly by the hand, and again thanked him for the care and love which he had lavished on her child. At length she said “Farewell!” and I watched her as she went down the garden walk, to the wicket gate, and then across the road, until she entered a bye-path which wound among the hills of the Neprehaun into the valley below. She was lost to my sight in the shadows of the foliage. She emerged to view again far down the valley, and I saw her enter her grand carriage, and saw her kerchief waving from the carriage window, as it rolled away. I watched, O how earnestly I watched, until the carriage rose to sight, on the summit of a distant hill, beyond the spire of the village church. Then, as it disappeared, and bore my mother from my sight, I sat down and wept bitterly. Would I had never seen her face again! CHAPTER II. A year passed away. It was June again. One summer evening I took the path which led from the garden to the summit of the hill which rose behind the cottage. As I pursued my way upward, the sun was setting, and at every step I obtained a broader glimpse of the river, the dark Palisades, and the bay white with sails. When I reached the summit, the sun was on the verge of the horizon, and the sky in the west all purple and gold. Seating myself on the huge rock, which rose on the summit, surrounded by a circle of good old trees, I surrendered myself to the quiet and serenity of the evening hour. The view was altogether beautiful. Beneath me sloped the broad hill, clad in wheat, which already were changing from emerald to gold; farther down, my cottage home, half hidden among trees; then, beneath the cottage, the houses of the village dotted the hills among which wound the Neprehaun. The broad river and the wide bay, heaving gently in the fading light, and the dark Palisades rising blackly against the gold and purple sky. A lovelier view cannot be imagined. And the air was full of summer; scented with breath of vines and blossoms, and new-mown hay. As I surrendered myself to thoughts which rose unbidden, the first star came tremulously into view, and the twilight began to deepen into night. I was thinking of my life—of the past—of the future. A strange vision of the great world struggled into dim shape before the eye of my mind. “A year more, and I will enter the great world!” I ejaculated. A hand was laid lightly on my shoulder—I started to my feet with a shriek. “What, Frank, don't you know me?” said a half-laughing voice; and I beheld beside me a youth of some nineteen or twenty years, whose face, shaded by dark hair, was touched by the last flush of the declining day. It was Ernest, the only son of the good clergyman. I had not seen him for three years. In that time, he had grown from boyhood into young manhood. He sat beside me on the rock, and we talked together as freely as when we were but little children. Ernest was full of life and hope; his voice grew deep, his dark eyes large and lustrous, as he spoke of the prospects of his future. “In one year, Frank, I will graduate, and then—then—the great world lies before me!” His gaze was turned dreamily to the West, and his fine features drawn in distinct profile against the evening sky. “And what part, Ernest, will you play in the great world?” “Father wishes me to enter into the ministry, but”—and he uttered a joyous, confident laugh—“whatever part I play I know that I will win!” He uttered these words in the tone of youth and hope that has never been darkened by a shadow, and then turning to me— “And you, Frank, what part will you play in the great world?” he said. “I know not; my career is in the hands of my only parent, who will come next year to take me hence. My childhood has been wrapt in mystery; and my future—Oh! who can foretell my future?” He gazed at me, for the first time, with an earnest and searching gaze. His eyes, large and gray, and capable of the most varied expression, became absent and dreamy. “You are very beautiful!” he said, as though thinking aloud. “O, very beautiful! You will marry rich—yes, wealth and position will be yours at once.” And as the moon, rising over the brow of the hill, poured her light upon his thoughtful face, he took my hand and said. “Frank, why is it that certain natures live only in the future or the past —never in the present? Look at ourselves, for instance. Yonder, among the trees, bathed in the light of the rising moon, lies the cottage home in which we have passed the happiest, holiest hours of life. Of that home we are not thinking now, we are only looking forward to the future, and yet the time will come, when, immersed in the conflict of the world, we will look back to that home with the same yearning that one stretched upon the couch of hopeless disease looks forward to his grave!” His voice was low and solemn; I never forgot his words. We sat for many minutes in silence. At length, without a word, he took my hand, and we went down the hill together, by the light of the rising moon. We climbed the style, passed under the garden boughs, and entered the cottage, and found the good old man, seated in his library among his books. He raised his eyes, as we come in, hand joined in hand, and a look of undisguised pleasure stole over his face. “See here, father!” said Ernest, laughingly. “When I went to college, I left my little sister in your care. I now return and discover that my little sister has disappeared, and left in her place the wild girl whom I found wandering to-night among the hills. Don't you think there is something like a witch in her eyes?” The old man smiled and laid his hand on my dark hair. “Would to Heaven!” he said, “that she might never leave this quiet home.” And the prayer came from his heart. Ernest remained with us until fall. Those were happy days. We read, we talked, we walked, we lived with each other. More like sister and sister, than brother and sister, we wandered arm in arm to the brow of the hill as the rich summer evening came on,—or crossed the river in early morning and climbed the winding road that led to the brow of the Palisades,—or sat at night under the trees by the river's bank, watching the stars as they looked down into the calm water. Sometimes at night we sat in the library, and I read, while the old man's hand rested gently on my head, and Ernest sat by my side. And often upon the porch, as the summer night wore on, Ernest and myself sang together some old familiar hymn, while “father” listened in quiet delight. Thus three months passed away, and Ernest left for college. “Next year, Frank, I graduate,” he cried, his thoughtful face flushed with hope, and his gray eyes full of joyous light—“and then for the battle with the world!” He left, and the cottage seemed blank and desolate. The good clergyman felt his absence most keenly. “Well, well!” he would mutter, “a year is soon round, and then Ernest will be with us again!” As for myself, I tried my books, my harp, took long walks alone, busied myself in household cares, but I could not reconcile myself to the absence of Ernest. Winter came, and one night a letter arrived from Ernest to his father, and in that letter, one for Frank! How eagerly I took it from “father's” hand, and hurried to my room; that room which I remember yet, so vividly, with its window opening on the garden, and the picture of the Virgin Mary on the snow-white wall. Unmindful of the cold, I sat down alone, and perused the letter—O how eagerly! It was a letter from a brother to a sister, and yet beneath the calm current of a brother's love there flowed a deeper and a warmer love. How joyously he spoke of his future, and how strangely he seemed to mingle my name with every image of that future! I read his letter over and over, and slept with it upon my bosom. And I dreamed, O such air-castle dreams, in which a whole life-time seemed to pass away, while Ernest and Frank, always young, always happy, went wandering, hand in hand, under skies without a cloud. But I awoke in fright and terror. It seemed to me that a cold hand—like that of a corpse—was laid upon my bosom, and somehow I thought that my mother was dead, and that it was her hand. I started up in fright and tears, and lay shuddering until the rising sun shone gaily through the frosted window-pane. Another year had nearly passed away. It was June again, and it was towards evening, that I stood upon the cottage porch, watching—not the cloudless sky and glorious river, bathed in the setting sun—but watching earnestly for the sound of a footstep. Ernest was expected home. He had graduated with all the honors—he was coming home. How I watched and waited for that welcome step! At last the wicket gate was opened, and Ernest's step resounded on the garden walk. Concealing myself among the vines which covered one of the pillars of the porch, I watched him as he approached, determining to burst upon him in a glad surprise, as soon as he reached the steps. His head was downcast, he walked with slow and thoughtful steps; his long black hair fell wild and tangled on his shoulders. The joyous hue of youth on his cheek had been replaced by the pallor of long and painful thought. The hopeful boy of the last year had been changed into the moody and ambitious man. As he came on, although my heart swelled to bursting at sight of him, I felt awed and troubled, and forgot my original intention of bursting upon him in a merry surprise. He reached the porch—he ascended the step—and I glided silently from behind the pillar and confronted him. O how his face lighted up as he saw me! His eyes, no longer glassy and abstracted, were radiant with a delight too deep for words! “Frank!” he said, and silently pressed my hand. “Ernest!” was all I could reply, and we stood in silence—both trembling, agitated—and gazing into each other's eyes. The good clergyman was happy that evening, as he sat at the supper table with Frank on one hand and Ernest on the other. And old Alice, peering at us through her spectacles, could not help remarking—“Well, well! only yesterday, children, and now such a handsome couple!” After supper, Ernest and I went to the rock on the summit of the hill, where we had met the year before. The scene was the same—the river, the bay, the dark Palisades, and the vast sky, illumined by the rising moon—but somehow we seemed changed. We sat apart from each other on the rock, and sat for a long time in silence. Ernest, with downcast eyes, picked in an absent way at some flowers which grew in the crevices of the rock. And I—well, I believe I tied the strings of my sun-bonnet into all sorts of knots. I felt half disposed to laugh and half disposed to cry. At last I broke the silence— “You have fulfilled your words, Ernest,” I said, “you have graduated with all the honors—as last year you said you would—and now a bright career stretches before you. You will go forth into the great world—you will battle, you will win!” “Frank,” said he, stretching forth his hand, “do you see yonder river, as it flows broad and rapid in the light of the rising moon? You speak of a bright career before me—now I almost wish that I was quietly asleep beneath those waves.” The sadness of his tone and look went to my heart. “You surprise me, Frank. Now,” and I attempted a laugh, “you have not fallen in love since last year, have you?” He looked up and surveyed me from head to foot. I was dressed in white— my hair fell in curls to my shoulders. In a year I had passed from the girl into the woman. I was taller, my form more roundly developed. And as he gazed upon me, I was conscious that he was remarking the change which had taken place in my appearance, and that his look was one of ardent admiration. “Do you think that I have fallen in love since last year?” he said slowly, and with a meaning look. I turned away from his gaze and exclaimed— “But you are moody, Ernest. Last year you were so hopeful—now so melancholy. You can, you will succeed in life!” “That I can meet with what the world calls success, I do not doubt,” he replied. “There is the career of the popular preacher, armed with a white handkerchief and a velvet Gospel—of the lawyer, growing rich with the rent paid to him by crime, and devoting all the powers of his immortal soul to prove that black is white and white is black—of the merchant, who sees only these words printed upon the face of God's universe, `Buy cheap and sell dear.' Careers such as these, Frank, are before me, and I am free to choose, and doubt not but that I could succeed in any of them. But to achieve such success, I would not spend —I do not say the labor of years—no— I would not spend the thought of a single hour.” “But the life of a good minister of the Gospel, Ernest, living in some quiet country town, dividing his time between his parishioners and his books, and dwelling in a house like the cottage yonder—what say you to such a life, Ernest?” He raised his eyes, and again surveyed me earnestly. “Ambitious as I am, I would sacrifice every thought of ambition for a life such as you picture, but upon one condition.” He paused. “And that condition?” I said, in a low voice. CHAPTER III. “Ask your own heart,” was his reply, uttered in a tremulous voice. I felt my bosom heave—was agitated, trembling I knew not why—but I made no answer. There was a long and painful pause. “The night is getting chill,” I said at length, for want of something better to say; “father is waiting for us; let us go home.” I led the way down the path, and he followed moodily, without a word. As he helped me over the stile, I saw that his face was pale, his lips tightly compressed. And when he came into the presence of his father, he replied to the old man's kind questions in a vacant and abstracted manner. I bade him “good-night!” at last; he answered me, but added in a low tone, inaudible to the old man, “Young, and rich, and beautiful, you are beyond the reach of—a country clergyman.” The next morning, while we were at breakfast, a letter came; it was from my mother; to-morrow she would come and take me from the cottage! The letter dropt from the old man's hand, and Ernest, rising abruptly from the table, rushed from the room. And I was to leave the home of my happiest hours, and go forth into the great world! The thought fell like a thunderbolt upon every heart in the cottage. After an hour, Ernest met me on the porch; he was very pale. “Frank,” said he kindly, “to-morrow you will leave us for ever. Would you not like to see once more the place yonder”—he pointed across the river to the Palisades—“where we spent so many happy hours last summer?” He spoke of that dear nook, high up among the rocks, encircled by trees, and canopied by vines, where we had indeed spent many a happy hour. I made no reply, but put on my sun-bonnet and took his arm, and in a little while we were crossing the river, he rowing while I sat in the stern. It was a beautiful day. We arrived at the opposite shore, at a point where the perpendicular wall of the Palisades is for a mile or more broken by a huge and sloping hill, covered with giant forest trees. Together we took the serpentine path, which, winding towards all points of the compass, led to the top of the Palisades. The birds were singing, broad forest leaves and hanging vines quivered in the sun, the air was balmy, and the day the very embodiment of the freshness and fragrance of June. As we wound up the road, (whose brown gravelled surface contrasted with the foliage,) we saw the sunlight streaming in upon the deep shadows of the wood, and heard from afar the lulling music of a waterfall. Departing from the beaten road, we wandered among the forest trees, and talked together as gladly and as familiarly as in other days. There we wandered for hours, now in sunlight, now in shadow, now resting upon the brow of some moss-covered rock, and now stopping beside a spring of clear cold water, half-hidden by thick green leaves. As noon drew near, we ascended to the top of the forest hill, and, passing through a wilderness of tangled vines, came suddenly upon a rude farm-house, one story high, built of logs, whose dark surface contrasted with the verdure of the garden and the foliage of the overshadowing tree. It was the same as in the year before. There was the well-pole rising above its roof and the well-bucket moist with clear cold water, and in the doorway stood the farmer's dame, who had often welcomed us to her quiet home. “Bless me!” how handsome my children have grown!” she cried; “and how's the good dominie? Come in, come in, the folks are all away in the fields; come in, and rest you, and have some pie and milk, and”—she paused for breath—“and some dinner.” The good dame would take no denial, and we sat down to dinner with her. I can see the scene before me now,—the carefully sanded floor, the old clock in the corner, the cupboard glistening with the burnished pewter, the neatly spread table, the broad hearth, covered with green boughs, and the open windows, with the sunbeams playing through the encircling vines; and then the good dame, with her high cap, round, good-humored face, and spectacles resting on the bridge of her hooked nose. As we broke the homemade bread with her, we were as gay as larks. “Well, I do like to see young folks enjoy themselves,” said the dame. “You don't know how often I have thought of you since you were here last summer. I have said, and I will say it, that a handsomer brother and sister I never yet did see.” “But you mistake,” said Ernest; “we are not brother and sister.” “Only cousins,” responded the dame, surveying us attentively; “well I'm glad of it. For there is no law agin cousins marrying, and you'd make such a handsome couple.” And she laughed until her sides shook. Leaving the farm-house, we bent our way to the Palisades again. We had been gay and happy all the morning; now we became thoughtful. We entered a narrow path, and presently came upon the dear nook where we had spent so many happy hours. It was a quiet space of green sward and velvet moss, encircled, on all sides save one, by the trunks of giant forest trees; the oak, the tulip, the poplar and the sycamore— which arose like rugged columns, their branches forming a roof far overhead. Half way between the sward and the branches, hung a display of vines, swinging in the sunlight, and showering blossoms and fragrance in the summer air. Light shrubbery grew between the massive trunks of the trees, and in one part of the glade a huge rock arose, its summit projecting over the sward, and forming a sort of canopy, or shelter, for a rustic seat fashioned of oaken boughs. Looking upward through the drapery of vines and the roof of boughs, only one glimse of blue sky was visible. Toward the east the glade was open, and over the tops of the forest trees, (which rose from the glen beneath,) you saw the river, the distant village and my cottage home shining in the sun. At the foot of the oak, which formed one of the portals of the glade, was a clear cold spring, resting in a basin of rock, and framed in leaves and flowers. Altogether, the dear nook of the forest was worthy of June. For a moment we surveyed the quiet scene—thought of the many happy hours we had spent there, in the previous summer—and then, turning our faces to the east, we stood hand linked in hand, gazing over forest trees and river, upon our far-off cottage home. “Does it not look beautiful as it shines there in the sun?” I said. Ernest at first did not reply, but turned his gaze full upon me. His face was flushed and there was a strange fire in his eyes. “To-morrow you leave that home for ever!” he exclaimed; and I trembled, I knew not why, at the sound of his voice. “I will never see you again.” He dropped my hand and turned his face away I saw his head fall on his breast, and saw that breast heave with agitation. Urged by an impulse I could not control, I glided to his side, put my hand upon his arm, and looked up into his face. “Ernest,” I whispered. He turned to me, for a moment regarded me with a look of intense passion, and then caught me to his heart. His arm was around me, my bosom heaved against his breast, his kiss was on my lips—the first kiss since childhood, and O how different from the kiss which a brother presses on a sister's lips! “Frank, I love you! Many beautiful women have I seen, but there is that in your gaze, your voice, your very presence, which is heaven itself to me. I cannot live without you, and cannot, cannot think of losing you without madness. Frank, be mine, be my wife! Be mine, and the house which shines yonder in the sunlight shall be ours! Frank, for God's sake, say you love me!” He sank at my feet and clasped my knees with his trembling hands. O, the joy, the rapture of that moment! As I saw his face upraised to mine, I felt that I loved him with all my soul, that I could die for him. Reaching forth my hands, I drew him gently to his feet, and fell upon his breast and called him “husband!” Would I had died there, on his bosom, even as his lips met mine, and the words “my wife!” trembled on my ear! Would I had at that moment fallen dead upon his breast! Even as he gathered me to his bosom the air all at once grew dark; looking overhead we saw a vast cloud rolling up the heavens—dark as midnight, yet fringed with sunlight. Onward, on it rolled; the air grew darker, darker; an ominous thunder-peal broke over our heads, and rolled away among the gorges of the hills. Then the glade grew dark as night. We could not see each other's faces. For a moment our distant home shone in sunlight, and then the eastern sky was wrapt in clouds, the river hidden by driving rain. Trembling with fright I clung to Ernest's neck; he bore me to the bench in the shadow of the rock; another thunder-peal, and a flash of lightning that blinded me. I buried my face in his bosom to hide my eyes from that awful glare. The tempest which had arisen so suddenly—even as we exchanged our first vows—was now upon us and in power. The trees rocked to the blast. The distant river was now dark, and now one mass of sheeted flame. Peal on peal the thunder burst over our heads, and as one peal died away in distant echoes, another more awful seemed hurled upon us from the very zenith. And amid the darkness and glare of that awful storm, I clung to Ernest's neck, my bosom beating against his heart, and we repeated our vows, and talked of our marriage, and laid plans for our future. “Frank, my heart is filled with an awful foreboding,” he said, and his voice was so changed and husky that I raised my head from his bosom, and even in the darkness sought to gaze upon his face. A lightning flash came and was gone, but by that momentary glare I saw his countenance agitated in every lineament. “What mean you, Ernest?” “You will leave our home to-morrow and never return—never! The sunshine which was upon us, as we exchanged our vows, was in a moment succeeded by the blackness of the awful tempest. A bad omen, Frank, a dark prophecy of our future. There is only one way to turn the omen of evil into a prophecy of good!” He drew me closer in his arms and bent his lips to my ear—“Be mine, and now! Be mine! Let the thunder-peal be our marriage music—this forest glade our marriage couch!” I was faint, trembling, but I sprang from his arms, and stood erect in the centre of the glade. My dark hair fell to my shoulders. A flash of lightning lit up my form, clad in snow-white. As wildly, as completely as I loved him, I felt my eyes flash with indignation. “Words like these to a girl who has been reared under your father's roof?” He fell at my feet—besought my forgiveness in frantic tones—and bathed my hands with his tears. I fainted in his arms. When I unclosed my eyes again, I found myself pure and virgin in the arms of my plighted husband. The clouds were parting, the tempest was over, and the sun shone out once more. Every leaf glittered with diamond drops. The last blast of the storm was passing over the distant river and through the driving clouds; I saw the sunlight shining once more upon our cottage home. “Forgive me, Frank! forgive me!” he cried, bending passionately over me. “See!—your bad omen has been turned into good!” I cried joyfully. “First, the sunshine; then, the storm; but now the sun shines clear again”— and I pointed to the diamond drops glittering in the sun. “And you will be true to me, Frank?” “Before Heaven, I promise it; in life, in death, for ever!” CHAPTER IV. It was towards the close of the afternoon that we took our way from the glade through the forest to the river shore. We crossed the river, and passed through the village. Together we ascended the road that led to our home, and at the wicket gate, found a splendid carriage, with liveried servants. The good clergyman stood at the gate, his bared forehead and white hairs bathed in the sunshine; beside, darkly dressed, diamonds upon her rich attire, my mother. Old Alice stood weeping in the background. “Come, Frank, your things are packed, and we must be away,” she said abruptly, as though we had seen each other only the day before. “I wish to reach our home in New-York before night. Go in the house, dear”—she kissed me—“and get your bonnet and shawl. Quick! my love.” Not daring to trust myself to speak— for my heart was full to bursting—I hurried through the gate, and along the garden walk. “How beautiful she has grown!” I heard my mother exclaim. One look into the old familiar library room, one moment in prayer by the bed in which I had slept since childhood. Placing the bonnet on my curls, and wrapping my shawl around me, I hurried from my cottage home. There were a few moments of agony, of blessings, of partings and tears. Old Alice pressed me in her arms, and bid me good-bye. The good old clergyman laid his hands upon my head, and, lifting his streaming eyes to heaven, invoked the blessing of God upon my head. “I give your child to you again!” he said, placing me in my mother's arms, “May she be a blessing to you, as for years past she has been the blessing and peace of my home!” I looked around for Ernest—he had disappeared. I entered the carriage, and sunk sobbing on the seat. “But I am not taking the dear child away from you for ever,” said my mother, bending from the carriage window. “She will come and see you often, my dear Mr. Walworth, and you will come and see her. You have the number of our town residence on that card. And bring your son, and good Alice with you, and” — The carriage rolled away. So strange and unexpected had been the circumstances of this departure from my home, that I could scarce believe myself awake. I did not raise my head, until we had descended the hill, passed the village, and gained a mile or more on our way. We were ascending a long slope, which led to the summit of a hill, from which, I knew, I might take a last view of my childhood's home As we reached the summit of the hill, my mother was looking out of one window toward the river, and I looked out of the other, and saw, beyond the church-spire and over the trees, the white walls of my home. Ernest was by the carriage. “Frank!” whispered a low voice. There was a look exchanged, a word, and he was gone—gone into the trees by the roadside. He left a flower in my hand. I placed it silently in my bosom. “Frank! How beautiful you have grown!” said my mother, turning from the window, and fixing on me an ardent and admiring gaze. And the next moment she was wrapt in thought, and the wrinkle grew deeper between her brows. Before I resume my own history, I must relate an incident in the life of Ernest, which had an important bearing on his fate. (This incident I derive from MSS. written by Ernest himself.) Soon after my departure from the cottage-home, he came to New-York with his father, and they directed their steps to my mother's residence—as indicated on the card which she had left with the clergyman. But to their great disappointment they discovered that my mother and myself had just left town for Niagara Falls. Six months afterward Ernest received a long letter from me, concluding with these words: “To-morrow myself and mother take passage for Europe in the steamer. We will be absent for a year or more.” Determined to see me at all hazards, he hurried to town, but—too late! The steamer had sailed; her flag fluttered in the air, far down the bay, as standing on the Battery Ernest followed her course, with an almost maddened gaze. Sorrowfully he returned to the country, and informed his father of my sudden departure for Europe. “Can she have forgotten us?” said the old man. “O father, this letter!” replied Ernest, showing the long letter which I had written, “this will show you that she has not forgotten us, but that her heart beats warmly as ever—that she is the same.” And he read the letter to the good old man, who frequently interrupted him with: “God bless her! God bless my child!” Soon afterwards Ernest came to New-York and entered his name in the office of an eminent lawyer. Determining to make the law his profession, he hoped to complete his studies before my return from Paris. He lived in New-York, and began to move in the circles of its varied society. Among the acquaintances which he made were certain authors and artists, who, once a month, in company with a few select friends, gave a social supper at a prominent hotel. At one of these suppers Ernest was a guest. The wine passed round, wit sparkled, and the enjoyment of the festival did not begin to flag even when midnight drew near. While one of the guests was singing, a portly gentleman, (once well known as a man of fashion, the very Brummel of the side-walk,) began to converse with Ernest in a low voice. He described a lady—a young widow with a large fortune—who at that time occupied a large portion of the interest of certain circles in New-York. She was exceedingly beautiful. She was witty, accomplished, eloquent. She rivalled in fascination Ninon and Aspasia. Nightly, to a select circle, she presided over festivals whose voluptuousness was masked in flowers. Her previous history was unknown, but she had suddenly entered the orbit of New-York social life—of a peculiar kind of social life—as a star of the first magnitude. His blood heated by wine, his imagination aroused by the description of his fashionable friend, Er nest manifested great curiosity to behold this singular lady. “You shall see her to-night—at once,” whispered the fashionable gentleman. “She gives a select party to-night. Let us glide off from the company unobserved.” They passed from the company, took their hats and cloaks—it was a clear, cold winter night—and entered a carriage. “I will introduce you by the name of Johnson—Fred Johnson, a rich southern planter,” said the fashionable gentleman. “You need not call me by my real name; call me Lawson.” “But why this concealment?” asked Ernest, as the carriage rolled on. “O, well, never mind,” added Lawson, (as he desired to be called,) and then continued: “We'll soon be near her mansion, or palace, is the more appropriate word. You will find some of the first gentlemen and finest ladies of New-York under her roof. I tell you she'll set you half wild, this `Midnight Queen!'” “`Midnight Queen?'” echoed Ernest. “That's what we call her. A `midnight queen' indeed; as mysterious and beautiful as the midnight moon shining in an Italian sky.” They arrived in front of a lofty mansion, situated in one of the most aristocratic parts of New-York. Its exterior was dark and silent as the winter midnight itself. “A light hid under a bushel—outside dark enough, but inside bright as a new dollar,” whispered Lawson, ascending the marble steps and ringing the bell. The door was opened for the space of six inches or more. “Who's there!” said a voice from within. Lawson bent his face close to the aperture, and whispered a few words inaudible to Ernest. The door was opened wide and carefully closed and bolted behind them, as soon as they crossed the threshold. They stood in a vast hall, lighted by a hanging lamp. “Leave hats and cloaks here, and come.” Lawson took Ernest by the hand and pushed open a door. They entered a range of parlors, brilliantly lighted by two chandeliers, as brilliantly furnished with chairs, and sofas, and mirrors, and adorned with glowing pictures and statues of white marble. A piano stood in a recess, and in the last parlor of the three a supper-table was spread. These parlors were crowded by some thirty guests, men and women, some of whom, seated on the chairs and sofas, were occupied in low whispering conversation, while others took wine at the supper-table, and others again were grouped round the piano, listening to the voice of an exceedingly beautiful woman. Ernest uttered an ejaculation. Never had he seen a spectacle like this—never seen before, grouped under one roof, so many beautiful women. Beautiful women, richly dressed, their arms and shoulders bare, or veiled only by mist-like lace, which gave new fascination to their charms. It did not by any means decrease the surprise of Ernest, when he discovered that some of the ladies—those whose necks and shoulders glowed most white and beautiful in the lights—wore masks. “What is this place?” he whispered to Lawson, as, apparently unheeded by the guests, they passed through the parlors. “Hush! not so loud!” whispered his companion. “Take a glass of wine, my boy, and your eyesight will be clearer. This place is a quiet little retreat, in which certain gentlemen and ladies of New-York, by no means lacking in wealth or position, endeavor to carry the Koran into practice, and create, even in our cold climate, a paradise worthy of Mahomet. In a word, it is the residence of a widowed lady, who, blessed with fortune, and all the good things which fortune brings, delights in surrounding herself with beautiful women and intellectual men. How d'ye like that wine? There are at least a hundred gentlemen in New-York who would give a cool five hundred to stand where you do now, or even cross the threshold of this mansion. I'm an old stager, and have brought you here in order to enjoy the effect which a scene like this produces on one so inexperienced as you. But you must remember one law, which governs this place and all who enter it.” “That condition?” “All that is said or done remains a secret forever within the compass of these walls; and you must never recog nize, in any other place, any person whom you have first encountered here. This is a matter of honor, Walworth.” “And where is the `Midnight Queen?'” “She is not with her guests, I see; but I will give you an answer in a moment,” and Lawson left the room. Drinking glass after glass of champagne, Ernest stood by the supper-table, a silent spectator of that scene, whose voluptuous enchantment gradually inflamed his imagination and fired his blood. He seemed to have been suddenly transported from dull matter-of-fact, every-day life, to a scene in some far oriental city, in the days of Haroun Alraschid; and he surrendered himself to the enchantment of the place, like one for the first time enjoying the intoxication of opium. Lawson returned, and came quietly to his side. “Would you like to see the `Midnight Queen' alone—in her parlor?” he whispered. “Of all things in the world. You have roused my curiosity. I am like a man in a delicious dream.” “Understand me. She is chary of her smiles to an old stager like me; but I think that there is something in you that will interest her. She awaits you in her apartments. You are a young English lord, on your travels—(better than a planter)—Lord Stanley Fitzgerald. With that black dress and sombre face of yours, you will take her wonderfully.” “But can I indeed see her?” “Leave the room—ascend the stairs: at the head of the stairs a light shines from a door which is slightly open. Take a bold heart and enter.” Inflamed by curiosity, by the wine which he had drunk, and the scene around him, Ernest did not take time for second thought, but left the room, ascended the stairs, and stood before the door, from whose aperture a belt of light streamed out upon the dark passage. There for a moment he hesitated, but that was all. He stood spell-bound by the scene. If the parlors below were magnificently furnished, this apartment was worthy of an empress. There were lofty walls hung with silk hangings, and adorned with pictures; a couch with a silken canopy; mirrors that glittered gently in the rich voluptuous light—in a word, every detail of luxury and extravagance. In the centre of all stood the Midnight Queen—in one hand she held an open letter. Her back was turned to Ernest, as he lingered near the threshold. Her neck and shoulders were bare, and he could remark at a glance their snowy whiteness and voluptuous outlines, although her dark hair was gathered in glossy masses upon the shoulders, half hiding the face from view. A dark dress, rich in its simplicity, left her arms bare, and did justice to the rounded proportions of her form. She turned and confronted Ernest, even as he, the blood bounding in his veins, advanced a single step. At once they spoke: “My Lord Stanley, I believe”— “The Midnight Queen”— The words died on their lips. They stood as if suddenly frozen to the floor. The beautiful face of the Midnight Queen was pale as death, and as for Ernest, the glow of the wine had left his cheek—his face was livid and distorted. Moments passed and neither had power to speak. “O my God, it is Frank!” the words at last burst from the lips of Ernest, and he fell like a dead man at her feet. Yes, the Midnight Queen and Frances Van Huyden, his betrothed wife—six months ago resting on his bosom, and whispering “husband” in his ear, and now—the wife of another! A widow! or one utterly fallen from all virtue and all hope! Having thus given the incident from the life of Ernest, as far as possible from the very words of his MSS., let me continue my history from the hour when in company with my mother I left the cottage home of the good clergyman. After the incident just related, nothing in my life can appear strange. CHAPTER V. I was riding in my carriage with my mother towards New-York. “You are indeed very beautiful, Frank,” said she, once more regarding me attentively. “Your form is that of a mature woman, and your carriage (I remarked it as you passed up the garden walk) excellent. But this country dress will not do. We will do better than all that when we get to town.” It was night when the carriage left the avenue and rolled into Broadway. The noise, the glare, the people hurrying by, all frightened me. At the same time, Broadway brought back a dim memory of my early childhood in Paris. Turning from Broadway, the carriage at length stopped before a lofty mansion, the windows of which were closed from the side walk to the roof. “This is your home,” said my mother, as she led me from the carriage up the marble steps into the hall, where, in the light of a globular lamp, a group of servants in livery awaited us. “Jenkins!”—my mother spoke to an elderly servant in dark livery, turned up with red—“let dinner be served in half an hour.” Then turning to another servant, not quite so old, but wearing the same livery, she said: “Jones! Miss Van Huyden wishes to take a look at her house before we go to dinner. Take the light and go before us.” The servant, holding a wax candle, placed in a huge silver candlestick, went before us and showed us the house, from the first to the fourth floor. Never before had I beheld such magnificence, even in my dreams. I could not restram ejaculations of pleasure and surprise at every step—my mother keenly regarding me, sometimes with a faint smile, and sometimes with the wrinkle growing deeper between her brows. A range of parlors on the lower floor were furnished with everything that the most extravagant fancy could desire, or exhaustless wealth procure. Carpets that gave no echo to the step, sofas and chairs cushioned with velvet, and (so it seemed to me) framed in gold, mirrors extending from the ceiling to the floor, pictures, statues, and tables with tops either of marble or ebony, the walls lofty, and the ceiling glowing with a painting which represented Aurora and the Hours winging their way through a summer sky. “Whose picture, mother?” I asked, pointing to a picture of a singularly handsome man, with dark hair and beard, and eyes remarkable at once for their brightness and expression. “Your father, dear,” answered my mother, and again the mark between her brows became ominously perceptible. “There is your piano, Frank—you'll find it something better than the one which you had at the good parson's.” The servant led the way up the wide stairway, thickly carpeted, to the upper rooms. Here the magnificence of the first floor was repeated on a grander and more luxurious scale. We passed through room after room, my eyes dazzled by new signs of wealth and luxury at every step. At last we paused on the thick carpet of a spacious bed chamber, whose appointments combined the richest elegance with the richest taste. It was hung with curtains of light azure. An exquisite and touching picture of the Virgin Mary confronted the toilette table and mirror. A bed, with coverlet white as snow, satin-covered pillows and canopy of lace, stood in one corner. And wherever I turned, there were signs of neatness, taste and elegance. I could not too much admire the apartment. “It is your bed-room, my dear,” said my mother, silently enjoying my delight. “Why,” said I laughingly, “It's grand enough for a queen.” “And are you not a queen?” answered my mother; “and a very beautiful one?” Turning to the servant, who stood staring at me with eyes big as saucers, she said— “Tell Mrs. Jenkins, the housekeeper, to come here.” Jones left the chamber, and presently returned with Mrs. Jenkins, a portly lady, with a round, good-humored face. “Frank, this is your housekeeper.” Mrs. Jenkins simpered and courtesied, shaking at the same time the bundle of keys at her waist. “Mrs. Jenkins, this is your young mistress, Miss Van Huyden. Give me the keys.” She took the keys from the housekeeper, and placed them in my hands. “My dear, this house, and all that it contains, are yours. I surrender it to your charge.” Scarcely knowing what to do with myself, I took the keys—which were heavy enough—and handing them back to Mrs. Jenkins, hoped that she would continue to superintend the affairs of my mansion, as heretofore. All of which pleased my mother, and made her smile. “We will go to dinner without dressing,” and my mother led the way down stairs to the dining-room. It was a large apartment, in the centre of which stood a luxuriously furnished table, glittering with gold plate. Servants in livery stood like statues behind my chair and my mother's. How different from the plain fare and simple style of the good clergyman's home! Nay, how widely contrasted with the rude dinner in a log cabin, to which Ernest and myself sat down a few hours ago! In vain I tried to partake of the rich dishes set out before me. I was too much excited to eat. Dinner over, coffee was served, and the servants retired. Mother and I were left alone. “Frank, do you blame me,” she said, looking at me carefully, “for having you reared so quietly, far away in the country, in order that at the proper age, strong in health, and rich in accomplishment and beauty, you might be prepared to enter upon the engagements and duties suitable to your station?” How could I blame her? I spoke gratefully, again and again, of the wealth and comfort which surrounded me, and then, forgetting it all, broke forth into impassioned praise of my cottage home, of the good clergyman, of old Alice, and—Ernest. Something which came over my mother's face at the mention of Ernest's name, warned me that it was not yet time to speak of my engagement to her. That night I bathed my limbs in a perfumed bath, laid my head on a silken pillow, and slept beneath a canopy of lace, as soft, and light, and transparent, as the summer mist through which you can see the blue sky and the distant mountain. And resting on the silken pillow, I dreamed—not of the splendor with which I was surrounded, nor of the golden prospects of my future—but of my childhood's home, and the quiet scenes of other days. In my sleep, my heart turned back to them. Once more I heard the voice of the good old man. I heard the shrill tones of Alice, as the sun shone on my frosted window-pane on a clear cold winter morn. Then the voice of Ernest, calling me “wife,” and pressing me to his bosom in the forest nook. I awoke with his name on my lips, and— 2 My mother stood by the bedside gazing upon me attentively, a smile on her lips, but the wrinkle darkly defined between her brows. The sun shone brightly through the window curtains. “Get up! my dear;” she kissed me,— “You have a busy day before you.” And it was a busy day! I was handed over to the milliners and dressmakers, and whirled in my carriage from one jeweller's shop to another. It was not until the third day that my dresses were completed,—according to my mother's taste,—and not until the fourth that the jewels which were to adorn my forehead, my neck, my arms and bosom, had been properly selected. Wardrobe and diamonds worthy of a queen!—and was I happy? No. I began to grow homesick for my dear quiet home, on the hill-side above the Neprehaun. It was on the fourth day, in the afternoon, that my mother desired my presence in the parlor, where she wished to present me to a much esteemed friend, Mr. Wareham,—Mr. Wallace Wareham. “An excellent man,” whispered my mother, as we went down stairs together, “and immensely rich.” I was richly dressed in black, my neck, my arms and shoulders bare. My dark hair, gathered plainly aside from my face, was adorned by a single snow-white flower. As I passed by the mirror in the parlor, I could not help feeling a sort of womanly pride, or—vanity; and my mother whispered, “Frank, you excel yourself to-day.” Mr. Wareham sat on the sofa, in the front parlor, in the mild light of the curtained window. He was an elderly gentleman, somewhat bald, and slightly inclined to corpulence. He was sleekly clad in black, and there was a gold chain across his satin vest, and a brilliant diamond upon his ruffled bosom. He sat in an easy, composed attitude, resting both hands on his gold-headed cane. At first sight he impressed me, as an elderly gentleman, exceedingly nice in his personal appearance, and that was all. But there was something peculiar and remarkable about his face and look, which did not appear at first sight. I was presented to him; he rose and bowed; and took me kindly by the hand. Then conversing in a calm, even tone, which soon set me at ease, he led me to talk of my childhood,—of my home on the Neprehaun,—of the life which I had passed with the good clergyman. I soon forgot myself in my subject, and grew impassioned—perchance, eloquent. I felt my cheeks glow and my eyes sparkle. But all at once I was brought to a dead pause, by remarking the singular expression of Mr. Wareham's face. I stopped abruptly, blushed, and at a glance surveyed him closely. His forehead was high and bald, and encircled by slight curls of black hair, streaked with gray, its expression eminently intellectual. But the lower part of his face was heavy, almost animal. There was a deep wrinkle on either side of his mouth; and as for the mouth itself, its upper lip was thin, almost imperceptible, while the lower one was large, projecting, and of a deep red, approaching purple; thus presenting a singular contrast to the corpse-like pallor of his cheeks. His eyes, half hidden under the bulging lids, when I began my description of my childhood's home, all at once expanded, and I saw their real expression and color. They were large, the eyeballs exceedingly white, and the pupils clear gray, and their expression reminding you of nothing that you had ever seen or heard of, but simply made you afraid. And as the eyes expanded, a slight smile would agitate his upper lip, while the lower one protruded, disclosing a set of artificial teeth, white as milk. It was the sudden expansion of the eyes, the smile on the upper lip and the protrusion of the lower one, that made up the peculiar expression of Mr. Wareham's face—an expression which made you feel as though you had just awoke from a grotesque yet frightful dream. “Why do you pause, daughter?” said my mother, observing my confusion. “Proceed, my child,” said Mr. Wareham, devouring me from head to foot, with his great eyes, at the same time rubbing his lower lip against the upper, as though he was tasting something good to eat. “I enjoy these delightful reminiscences of childhood. I doat on such things.” But I could not proceed—I blushed again, and the tears came into my eyes. “You have been fatigued by the bustle of the last three days,” said my mother, kindly. “Mr. Wareham will excuse you,” and she made me a sign to leave the room. Never was a sign more willingly obeyed. I hurried from the room, and as I closed the door, I heard Mr. Wareham say in a low voice— “She'll do. When will you tell her?” CHAPTER VI. That night, as I sat on the edge of my bed, clad in my night-dress, my dark hair half gathered in a lace cap, and half falling on my shoulders, my mother came suddenly into the room, and, placing her candle on the table, took her seat by me on the bed. She was, as I have told you, an exceedingly beautiful woman, in spite of the threads of silver in her hair, and the ominous wrinkle between her brows. But as she sat by me, and put her arm about my neck, toying with my hair, her look was infinitely affectionate. “And what do you think of Mr. Wareham, dear?” she asked me, and I felt that her gaze was fixed keenly on my face. I described my impressions frankly, and with what language I could command, concluding with the words, “In short, I do not like him. He makes me feel afraid.” “O, you'll soon get over that,” answered my mother. Now he takes a great interest in you. Let me tell you something about him. He is a foreign gentleman, immensely rich; worth hundreds of thousands, perhaps a million. He has estates in this country, in England and France. He has travelled over half the globe; on further acquaintance you will be charmed by his powers of observation, his fund of anecdote, his easy flow of conversational eloquence. And then he has a good heart, Frank! I could keep you up all night in repeating but a small portion of his innumerable acts of benevolence. I met him first in Paris, years ago, just after he had unhappily married. And since I first met him, he has been my fast friend. He is a good, a noble man, Frank; you will, you must like him.” “But then his eyes, mother! and that lip! and I cast my eyes meekly to the floor. “Pshaw!” returned my mother, with a start, “Don't allow yourself to make fun of a dear personal friend of mine.” She kissed me on the forehead. “You will like him, dear,” and bade me good-night! And on my silken pillow I slept and dreamed—of home—of the good old man —of Ernest and the forest nook—but all my dreams were haunted by a vision of two great eyes and a huge red lip— everywhere, everywhere they haunted me, the lip now projecting over the clergyman's head, and the eyes looking over Ernest's shoulder. I awoke with a start and a laugh. “You are in good spirits, my child,” said my mother, who stood by the bed. “I had a frightful dream, but it ended funnily. All night long I've seen nothing but Mr. Wareham's eyes and lip; but the last I saw of them, they were flying like butterflies a few feet above ground. Eyes first, and lip next, and old Alice chasing them with her broom.” “Never mind; you will like him,” rejoined my mother. I certainly had every chance to like him. For three days he was a constant visitor at our house. He accompanied mother and myself in a drive along Broadway, and out on the avenue. I enjoyed the excitement of Broadway, and the fresh air of the country, but— Mr. Wareham was by my side, talking pleasantly, even eloquently, and looking all the while as if he would like to eat me. We went to the opera, and for the first time, the fairy world of the stage was disclosed to me. I was enchanted —the lights, the costumes, the music, the circle of youth and beauty, all wrapt me in a delicious dream, but—close by my side was Mr. Wareham, his eyes expanded and his lip protruding; I thought of the Arabian Nights, and was reminded of a well-dressed ghoul. I began to hate the man. On the fourth day he brought me a handsome bracelet, glittering with diamonds, which my mother bade me accept, and on the fifth day I hated him with all my soul. There was an influence about him, which repelled me and made me afraid. It was the sixth night in my new home, and, in my night-dress, I was seated on the edge of my bed, the candle near, and my mother by my side. She had entered the room with a serious and even troubled face. The wrinkle was marked deep between her brows. Fixing my lace cap on my head, and smoothing my curls with a gentle pressure of her hand, she looked at me long and anxiously, but in silence. “O, mother,” I said, “when will we visit `father,' and good old Alice, and —Ernest? I am so anxious to see my home again!” “You must forget that home,” said my mother, gravely. “You will shortly be surrounded by new ties and new duties. Nay, do not start and look at me with so much wonder! I see that I must be plain with you. Listen to me, Frank! Who owns this house?” “It is yours.” “The pictures, the gold plate, the furniture, worthy of such a palace?” “Yours, all yours, mother.” “Who purchased the dresses and the diamonds which you wear?—dresses and diamonds worthy of a queen.” “You did, mother, of course.” I hesitated. “Wrong, Frank! all wrong!” and her eyes shone vividly, and the mark between her brows grew blacker. “The house which shelters you, the furniture which meets your gaze, the dresses which clothe you, and the diamonds which adorn your person, are the property of— Mr. Wareham.” It seemed to me as if the floor had opened at my feet. “O, mother, you are jesting!” I faltered. “I am a beggar, child, and you are a beggar's daughter. It is to Mr. Wareham that we are indebted for all that we enjoy. For years he has paid the expenses of your education. And now, that you have grown to young womanhood, he shelters you in a palace, surrounds you with splendor that a queen might envy; and, not satisfied with this,”— She paused and fixed her eyes upon my face. I knew that I was frightfully pale. “Offers you his hand in marriage.” For a moment, the light, the mirrors, the roof itself swam round me, and I sank, half fainting, into my mother's arms. “O, this is but a jest, a cruel jest, to frighten me,—say, mother, it is a jest?” “It is not a jest; it is sober, serious earnest;” and she raised me sternly from her arms. “He has offered his hand, and you will marry him.” I flung myself on my knees at the bedside, clasped her hands, and as my night-dress fell back from my shoulders and bosom, I told her, with my sobs and tears, of my love for Ernest, and my engagement with him. “Pshaw! A poor clergyman's son!” “O, let us leave this place, mother,” I cried, still pressing her hands to my bosom. “You say that we are poor. Be it so. We will find a home together, in the home of my childhood. Or if that fails us, I will work for you,—I will toil from sun to sun, and all night long,— beg,—do anything rather than marry this man. For, mother—I cannot help it—but I do hate him with all my soul.” “Pretty talk, very pretty!” and she tore her hand from my grasp. “But did you ever try poverty, my child? Did you ever know what the word meant,— POVERTY! Did you ever work sixteen hours a day at your needle for as many pennies? Walk the streets at dead of winter in half-naked feet, and go for two long days and nights without a mouthful of food? Did you ever try it, my child? That's the life which poor widows and their pretty daughters live here in New-York, my dear.” “But Ernest loves me; he will make his way in life—we will be married —you will share our home, dear mother.” These words rendered her perfectly furious. She started up and uttered a frightful oath, and it was the first time I had ever heard an oath from a woman's lips. Her countenance for a moment was fiendish. She assailed me with a torrent of reproaches, concluding thus,— “And this is your gratitude for the care, the anxiety, the very agony of a mother's anxiety, which I have endured on your account for years? In return for all, you condemn me to—poverty. But it shall not be. One of us must bend, and that one will not be me. I swear, girl—” her brows were knit, she was lividly pale, and she raised her right hand to Heaven, “that you shall marry this man!” “And I swear,”—I bounded to my feet, my bosom bare, and the blood boiling in my veins; perchance it was the same blood which gave my mother her fiery temper,—“I swear that I will not marry him, as long as there is life in me. Do you hear me, mother? Before I marry that miserable wretch, whose very presence fills me with loathing, I will fall a corpse at your feet!” My words, my attitude, took her by surprise. She surveyed me silently, but was too much enraged to speak. “O, that my father was living!” I cried, the fit of passion succeeded by a burst of tears—“he would save me from this hideous marriage.” My mother quietly drew a letter from her bosom, and placed it open in my hand. “Your father is living. That letter is the last one I have received from him. Read it, my angel.” I took it—it was very brief—I read it at a glance. It was addressed to my mother, and bore a recent date. These were its contents: “Dear Frank,—My sentence expires in two weeks from to-day. Send me some decent clothes, and let me know where I will meet you. Glad to hear that your plans as regards our daughter approach a `glorious' completion. “Yours, as ever, “Charles.” It was a letter from a convict in Auburn prison—and that convict was my father! CHAPTER VII. “It is false—my father died years ago!” I cried in very agony. “This is not from my father.” “It is from your father.” answered my mother, “and, unless I send him the clothes which he asks for, you will see him in less than three weeks in his convict rags.” “Oh! mother, are you human? A mother to taunt her own daughter with her father's shame—” My temples throbbed madly, and my sight failed. All that mortal can endure and be conscious. I had endured. I sank on the floor, and had not my mother caught me in her arms. I would have wounded my forehead against the marble table. All night long, half waking, half de lirions, I tossed on my silken couch, mingling the name of my convict father and of Ernest in my broken exclamations. Once I was conscious for a moment, and looked around with clear eyes. My mother was watching over me. Her face was bathed in tears. She was human after all. That moment past, the delirium returned, and I struggled with horrible dreams until morning. When I awoke next morning, my mind was clear again, and, even as I unclosed my eyes, and saw the sunlight shining gaily through the curtains, a fixed purpose took possession of my soul. It was yet early morning. There was no one save myself in the chamber. Perchance, worn out by watching, my mother had retired to rest. I quietly arose and dressed myself—not in the splendid attire furnished by my mother, but in my plain white dress, bonnet and shawl which I had brought with me from my cottage home. “It is early. No one is stirring in the mansion. I can pass from the hall door unobserved. Then it is only sixteen miles to home—only sixteen miles—I can walk it.” And, at the very thought of meeting “father” and Ernest again, my heart leaped in my bosom. Determined to escape from the mansion at all hazards, I drew my veil over my face, my shawl across my shoulders, and hurried to the door. I opened it, my foot was on the threshold—when I found myself confronted by the portly form of Mrs. Jenkins. “Pardon me, Miss,” she said, placing herself directly before me—“Your mother gave me directions to call her as soon as you awoke.” “But I wish to take a short walk and breathe a little of the morning air,” I answered, and attempted to pass her. “The morning air is not good for young ladies,” said another voice, and my mother's face appeared over the housekeeper's shoulder. “After a while we will take a ride, my dear. For the present, you will please retire to your room.” Startled at the sound of my mother's voice, I involuntarily stepped back—the door was closed, and I heard the key turn in the lock. I was a prisoner in my own room. There I remained all day long my meals were served by the housekeeper and my maid Caroline. My mother did not appear. How I passed that day, a prisoner in my luxurious chamber, cannot be described. I sat for hours, with my head resting on my hands, and my eyes to the floor. What plans of escape, mingled with forebodings of the future, crossed my brain! At length I took pen and paper, and wrote a brief note to Ernest, informing him of my danger, and begging him, as he loved me, to hasten at once to town and to the mansion. This note I folded, sealed and directed, properly. “Caroline,” said I to my maid, who was a pleasant-faced young woman of about twenty, with dark hair and eyes, “I would like this letter to be placed in the post-office at once. Will you take charge of it for me?” “I'll give it to Jones,” she responded; “he's going down to the post-office right away.” “But, Caroline,” I regarded her with a meaning look, “I do not wish any one to know that I sent this letter to the post-office. Will you keep it a secret?” “Not a livin' mortal shall know it— not a livin' mortal”—and taking the letter she left the room. After a few minutes she returned with a smiling face, “Jones has got it and he's gone!” I could scarce repress a wild ejaculation of joy. Ernest will receive it to-night—he will be here to-morrow—I will be saved!” The day wore on and my mother did not appear. Toward evening Caroline came into my room, bearing a new dress upon her arm—a dress of white satin, richly embroidered and adorned with the costliest lace. “O, Miss, aint it beautiful!” cried Caroline, displaying the dress before me. “And the bonnet and veil to match it will be here to night, an' your new di'merdo. It is really fit for a queen.” It was, indeed, a magnificent dress. “Who is it for?” I asked. “Now come, aint that good! `Who is it for?' And you lookin' so innocent as you ask it; as if you did not know all the while that it is your bridal dress, and that you are to be married airly in the mornin', after which you will set off on your bridal touer.” “Caroline, where did you learn this?” I asked, my heart dying within me. “Why, how can you keep such things secret from the servants? Aint your mother been gettin' ready for it all day, and aint the servants been flyin' here and there, like mad, and Mr. Wareham's been so busy all day, and lookin' so pleased? Laus, Miss, how can you expect to keep such things from the servants?” I heard this intelligence conveyed in the garrulous manner of my maid, as a condemned person might hear the reading of his death-warrant. I saw that nothing could shake my mother in her purpose. She was resolved to accomplish the marriage at all hazards. In the morning I was to be married, transferred body and soul to the possession of a man whom I hated in my very heart. But I resolved that he should not possess me living. He might marry me, but he should only place the bridal ring upon the hand of a corpse. The resolution came in a moment. How to accomplish it was my next thought. Approaching Caroline in a guarded manner, I spoke of my nervousness and loss of sleep, and of a phial of morphine which my mother kept by her for a nervous affection. “Could you obtain it for me, Caroline? and without mother seeing you, for she does not like me to accustom myself to the use of morphine. I am sadly in want of sleep, but I am so nervous that I cannot close my eyes. Get it for me,” (I put my arms about her neck,) “that's a dear, good girl!” “Laus, miss! how kin one resist your purty eyes! It is in the casket on the bureau, is it? Just wait a moment.” She left the room and presently returned. She held the phial in her hand. I took it eagerly, pretended to place it in the drawer of a cabinet which stood near the bed, but, in reality, hid it in my bosom. “Now, mother, you may force on the marriage,” I mentally ejaculated; “but your daughter has the threads of her own destiny in her hand.” How had I accustomed myself to the idea of suicide? It came upon me not slowly, but like a flash of lightning. It was in opposition to all the lessons I had learned from the good clergyman. “But,” the voice of the tempter, seemed whispering in my ear, “while suicide is a crime, it becomes a virtue when it is committed to avoid a greater crime.” It is wrong to kill my body, but infinitely worse to kill both body and soul in the prostitution of an unholy marriage. As evening drew on I was left alone. I bathed myself, arranged my hair, and then attired myself in my white night robe. And then—as the last glimpse of day came faintly through the window curtains—I sank on my knees by the bed, and prayed. O how in one vivid picture the holy memories of the past came upon me in that awful moment! “Ernest, I will meet you in the better world!” I drank the contents of the phial and rose to my feet. At the same instant the door opened and my mother appeared, holding a lighted candle in her hand. She saw me in my white dress—was struck perchance by the wildness of my gaze—and then her eye rested upon the extended hand which held the phial. “Well, Frank, how do you like your marriage dress?” she began, but stopped, and changed color as she saw the phial. “O mother,” I cried, “with my last breath I forgive you, and pray God that you may be able to forgive yourself.” I saw her horror-stricken look, and I fell insensible at her feet. CHAPTER VIII. Are we the victims of circumstance, or are we, in every case, the authors of our own fortune, or of our own ruin? the causes of our own misery and crime? A question hard to answer—and yet which a myriad times ten thousand hearts have died in attempting to solve. Are there none who, from no fault of their own, are suddenly hurled from a life of calm innocence into an abyss of shame that has no hope; of crime that has no lower deep? Are there none who, without a single effort of their own, with no dark circumstance to grapple with, not one temptation to avoid, rise to the highest point of what the world calls success, and die at least in peaceful beds, rich in wealth and honors? Fate and free will are problems never to be solved this side of the grave, but for myself, from the depths of my agony, I cannot crush the cry which rises to my lips, “What was there in my childhood, all purity and innocence, to deserve the unutterable misery of my after life?” But to my history: When I awoke again—but I cannot proceed. There are crimes done every day, which the world knows by heart, and yet shudders to see recorded even in the most carefully veiled phrase. But the crime of which I was the victim was too horrible for belief. Wareham the criminal, my own mother the accomplice, the victim a girl of fifteen, who had been reared in purity and innocence afar from the world. When I awoke again—for the potion failed to kill, I found myself in my room and Wareham by my side, surveying me as a ghoul might look upon the dead body which he has stolen from the grave. The phial given to me by the maid did not contain a fatal poison, but merely a powerful anodyne, which sealed my senses for hours in sleep, and, combined with the re-action of harrowing excitement, left me for days in a state of half-dreamy consciousness. I awoke—my sight was dim, my senses dulled, but I knew that I was lost, lost! Oh, how poor and tame that word, to express the living damnation of which I was the victim! The events of the next twenty-four hours I can but vaguely remember. I was taken from the bed, arrayed in the bridal costume, and then led down stairs into the parlor. There was a marriage celebrated there (as I was afterwards told). Yes! it was there that a minister of the Gospel, book in hand, sanctified with the name of marriage the accursed bargain of which I was the victim—marriage, that sacrament that makes of home, God's holiest altar, the truest type of heaven—marriage was in my case made the cloak of an unspeakable crime. I can remember that I said some words which my mother whispered in my ear, and that I signed my name to a letter which she had written. It was the letter which Ernest received, announcing my attention to visit Niagara. As for the letter which I had written to him on the previous day, it never went farther than from the hands of Caroline to those of my mother. I was hurried into a carriage, Wareham by my side, and then on board of a steamboat, and have a vague consciousness of passing up the Hudson river. I did not clearly recover my senses until I found myself at Niagara Falls, leaning on Wareham's arm, and pointed at by the crowd of visitors at the Falls as “the beautiful bride of the millionaire.” From the Falls, we passed up the Lakes, and then retraced our steps, visited the Falls again, journeyed to Montreal, and then home by Lake Champlain and the Hudson river. My mother did not accompany us. We were gone three months, and as the boat glided down the Hudson, the trees were already touched by autumn. As the boat drew near Tapaan bay I concealed myself in my state-room. I dared not look upon my cottage home. We arrived at home towards the close of a September day. My mother met me at the door, calm and smiling. She gave me her hand—but I pushed it quietly away. Wareham led me up the steps. I stood once more in that house, from which I had gone forth like one walking in her sleep. And that night, while in our chamber, Wareham and myself held a conversation, which had an important bearing on his life and mine. I was sitting alone in my chamber, dressed in a white wrapper, and my hair flowing unconfined upon my shoulders; my hands were clasped and my head bent upon my breast. I was thinking of the events of the last three months— of all that I had endured from the man whose very presence in the same room filled me with loathing. My husband entered, followed by Jenkins, who placed a lighted candle, a bottle of wine, and glasses on the table, and then departed. “What! is my pretty girl all alone, and in a thinking mood?” cried Wareham, seating himself by the table and filling a glass with wine. “And pray, my love, what is the subject of your thoughts?” And, raising his glass to his lips, he surveyed me from head to foot with that gloating gaze which always gave a singular light to his eyes. His face was slightly flushed on the colorless cheeks. He had already been drinking freely, and was now evidently under the influence of wine. “You have a fine bust, my girl,” he continued, as though he was repeating the `points' of a horse—“a magnificent arm, a foot that beats the Medicean Venus all hollow, and limbs,” (he paused and sipped his wine, protruding his nether lip, which now was scarlet red,) “such limbs! I like the expression of your eyes, there's fire in them. And your clear brown complexion, and your moist red lips, and”—he sipped his wine again—“altogether an elegant-built female.” And he rose and approached me. I also rose, my eyes flashing and my bosom swelling with suppressed rage. “Wareham, I warn you not to touch me,” I said in a low voice. “For three months I have been your prey. I will be so no longer. Before the world you may call me wife, if you choose—you have bought the right to do that,—but I inform you, once for all, that hence forth we are strangers. Do you understand me, Wareham? I had as lief be chained to a corpse, as to submit to be touched by you.” He fell back startled, his face manifesting surprise and anger, but in an instant his gaze was upon me again, and he indulged in a low burst of laughter. “Come, I like this! It is a pleasant change from the demure, pious-girl of three months ago, into the full-blown tragedy queen,”—he sank into a chair and filled another glass of wine. “Be seated, Frank, I want to have a little talk with my pet.” I resumed my seat. “You give yourself airs under the impression that you are my wife—joint owner of my immense fortune—my rich widow in perspective. Erroneous impression, Frank. I have a wife living in England.” The entirely malignant look which accompanied these words, convinced me of their sincerity. For a moment I felt as though an awful weight had crushed my brain, and by a glance at the mirror, I saw that I was frightfully pale. But, recovering myself by a strong exertion of will, I answered him in these words:— “Gentlemen who allow themselves more than one wife at a time, are sometimes (owing to an unfortunate prejudice of society) invited to occupy a department in the State Prison.” “And so you think you hold a rod over my head?” He drank his wine. “But I have only one wife, Frank. The gentleman who married you and me, was neither a clergyman nor officer of the law, but simply a convenient friend. Our mock marriage was not even published in the papers.” Every word went like an icebolt to my heart. I could not speak. Then as his eye glared, with a mingled look of hatred and of brutal passion, he sipped his wine as he surveyed me, and continued: “You used the word `bought,' some time ago. You were right. `Bought' is the word. You are simply my purchase. In Constantinople these things are easily managed. They keep an open market of fine girls there; but here we must find an affable mother and pay a large price—sometimes even marry the dear angels. I met your mother in Paris some years ago, and have been intimately acquainted with her ever since. When she first spoke of you, you were a child, and I was weary of the world—jaded, sick of its pleasures—by which I mean its women. An idea struck me! What if this pretty little child, now being educated in innocence and pious ways, and so forth, should, in the full blossom of her beauty and piety—say at the ripe age of sixteen—become the consoler of my declining years? And so I paid the expenses of your education (your father consenting that I should adopt you; but very possibly understanding the whole matter as well as your mother), and you were accordingly educated for me. And when I first saw you three months ago, it was your very innocence and pious way of talking which gave an irresistible effect to your beauty, and made me mad to possess you at all hazards.” It is impossible to depict the bitter mocking tone in which these words were spoken. “I settled this mansion, the furniture and so forth, upon your mother, with ten thousand dollars. That was the price. You see how much you have cost me, my dear.” “But I will leave your accursed mansion”—I felt, as I spoke, as though my heart was dead in my bosom,—“I am not chained to you in marriage. I am at least free.” I started to my feet and moved a step toward the door. “But where will you go? Back to your elderly clerical friend, with every finger levelled at you, and every voice whispering, `There goes the mistress of the rich Englishman!' Back to your village lover, to palm yourself upon him as a pure and spotless maiden?” I sank into the chair and covered my face with my hands. “Or will you begin the life of a poor seamstress, working sixteen hours a day for as many pennies, and at last take to the streets for bread!” His words cut me to the quick. I saw that there was no redemption in this world for a woman whose innocence has been sacrificed. “But think better of it, my dear! Your mother shall surround you with the most select and fashionable company in New-York; she shall give splendid parties; you will be the presiding genius of every festival. As for myself, dropping the name of husband, I will sink into an unobtrusive visitor. When you see a little more of the world, you will not think your case such a hard one after all.” My face buried in my hands, I had not one word of reply. Lost—lost! utterly lost! CHAPTER IX. My mother soon afterward gave her first party. It was attended by many of the rich and the fashionable of both sexes; and there was the glare of light, the presence of beautiful women, and the wine-cup and the dance. The festival was prolonged till daybreak, and another followed soon. The atmosphere was new to me. At first I was amazed, then intoxicated, and then—corrupted. Anxious to bury the memory of my shame, to forget how lost and abandoned I was, to drown every thought of my childhood's home, and of Ernest, who never could be mine, soon, from a silent spectator, I became a participant in the revels, which, night after night, were held beneath my mother's roof. The persons who mingled in these scenes were rich husbands, who came accompanied by other men's wives—wives who had sacrificed themselves in marriage, for the sake of wealth, to husbands twice their age; and these came with the husbands of other women. In a word, all that came to the mansion and shared in its orgies, were either the victims or the criminals of society—of a bad social world, which on every hand contrasts immense wealth and voluptuous indulgence with fathomless poverty and withering want, and which too often makes of a marriage but the cloak for infamy and prostitution. —I shared in every revel, and lost myself in their maddening excitement. I was admired, flattered, and elevated, at last, to the position of presiding genius of these scenes. I became the “Midnight Queen.” But let the curtain fall. One night I noticed a new visitor—a remarkably handsome gentleman—who sat near me at the supper-table, and whose hair and eyes and whiskers were as black as jet. He regarded me very earnestly, and with a look which I could not define. “Don't think me impertinent,” he said; and then added, in a lower voice, “for I am your father, Frank. Don't call me Van Huyden—my name is Tarleton now.” Fearful that I might one day encounter Ernest, I wrote him a long letter, breathing something of the tone of my early days—for I forgot for awhile my utterly hopeless condition—and informing him that mother and myself were about to sail for Europe, I wished him to believe that I was in a foreign land. And one night, while the revel was progressing in the rooms below, Wareham entered my room, and interested me in the description which he gave of a young lord, who wished to be introduced to me. “Young, handsome, and pale as if from thought. The very style of man you admire, my pet.” “Let him come up,” I answered, and Wareham retired. I stood before the mirror as the young lord entered, and as I turned I saw the face of my betrothed husband, Ernest Walworth. Upon the horror of that moment I need not dwell. He fell insensible to the floor, and was carried from the room, and the house, to the carriage, by Wareham, who had led him to the place. I have never seen the face of Ernest since that hour. I received one letter from him—one only—in which he set forth the circumstances which induced him to visit my house, and in which he bade me “farewell!” He is now in a foreign land. The bones of his father rest in the village church-yard. The cottage home is desolate. Wareham died suddenly, about a year after our “marriage.” The doctors said that his death was caused by an overdose of morphine, administered by himself in mistake. He died in our house; and as mother and myself stood over his coffin, in the darkened room, the day before the funeral, I noticed that she regarded first myself, and then the face of the dead profligate, with a look full of meaning. “Don't you think, dear mother,” I whispered, “that the death of this good man was very singular?” She made no reply, but still her face wore that meaning look. “Wouldn't it be strange mother, if your daughter, improving on your lessons, had added another feature to her accomplishments—had, from the Midnight Queen”—I lowered my voice— “become the Midnight Poisoner?” I met her gaze boldly—and she turned her face away. He died without even a dog to moan for him, and his immense wealth was inherited by a deserted and much-abused wife, who lived in a foreign land. Immense wealth in him bore its natural flower—a life of shameless indulgence ending in a miserable death. I did not shed very bitter tears at his funeral. Hatred is not the word to express the feeling with which I regard his memory. Soon afterwards my mother was taken ill, and wasted rapidly to death. Hers was an awful death-bed. The candle was burning to its socket, and mingled its rays with the pale moonlight which shone through the window-curtains. Her brown hair, streaked with gray, falling to her shoulders, her form terribly emaciated, and her eyes glaring in her shrunken face, she started up in her bed and clutched my hands in hers, and— begged me to forgive her. My heart was stone. I could not frame one forgiving word. As her chilled hands clutched mine, she rapidly went over the dark story of her life—how, from an innocent girl, she had been hardened into the thing she was—and again, her eyes glaring in my face, she sought my forgiveness. “I forgive you, mother,” I said slowly, and she died. My father was not present at her death, nor did he attend her funeral. As for myself—what has the future in store for me? O, for rest! O, for forgiveness! O, for a quiet sleep beneath the graveyard sod! And with that aspiration for rest, forgiveness, peace—uttered with all the yearning of a heart sick to the core of life, and all that life can inflict or give— ended the manuscript of Frances Van Huyden, the Midnight Queen. —We will now proceed to give the events of her life after the period comprised in her autobiography. CHAPTER X. [Explanatory Note.—Many scenes we might introduce from the life of the “Midnight Queen,” but from that dark and troubled history we will select but a single incident, the most important of her life. To understand this incident, the position of her father, Colonel Tarleton, otherwise known as Charles Van Huyden, must be clearly understood. For nearly twenty-one years from the infancy of Frances, he had lived with but one object—to remove from public view one of the children of a deceased brother, to obtain control of the other, and thus achieve possession of that brother's immense wealth. For this he planned and plotted; for this he committed the forgery which consigned him to the State Prison; for this he had even become a silent party to the degradation of his daughter. One heir of his brother's fortune removed, the other in his power, he began to see, over all the crimes of his life, the great motive of all his crimes ripen into success—he began to see Frank, the Midnight Queen, his daughter, in possession of almost boundless wealth. The day came at last. Frank, in his presence, had administered poison to one of the heirs. This was in the morning. Tarleton left her house, to complete his other scheme, to obtain possession of the remaining heir. And evening drew near— the evening which was to find all his schemes triumphant, and Frank the heiress of incredible wealth. Let us look into her sad home, in this evening hour.] It was toward evening when, amid the crowd of Broadway—that crowd of mad and impetuous life—there glided like a spectre through the mazes of a voluptuous dance, a man of sober habit, pallid face and downcast eyes. Beautiful women, wrapped in soft attire, passed him every moment, brushed him with their perfumed garments, but he heeded them not. There was the free laugh, the buzz of voices, and the tramp of footsteps all about him, but he did not raise his eyes nor bend his ear. Gliding along in his dark habit, he was as much alone on that thronged pathway as though he walked the sands of an Arabian desert. A man of hollow cheeks, features boldly marked, and eyes large and dark, and shining with the fire of disease, or with the restlessness of a soul that had turned upon itself, and was gnawing ever and ever at its own life-strings. His habit—a long black coat, single breasted, and with a plain white band about the neck—indicated that he was a Catholic priest. He was a priest. Struck down in his early manhood by an irreparable calamity, he had looked all around the horizon of his life for—peace. Repose, a quiet life, an obscure grave, became the objects of his soul's desire, instead of the ambitions which his young manhood had cherished. As there was not peace within him, so he searched the world for it, and in vain. He sought it in a money-bound Protestant church, behind whose pulpit bible, like a toad upon an altar, (too often,) Mammon, holy Mammon squats in bank-note grandeur. And there he found money and much cant, and abundance of sect, but no peace. To the Catholic church he turned. Won by the poetry of that church—we use the word in its awful and intense sense—for poetry and religion are one— he sought repose in its bosom. Did he find peace? Yes, when veiling his eyes from * * * he opened the gospels, and from their pages saw kindle into life and love, the face of him whom creeds may ministerpret or defame, but whose name forever, to suffering humanity, is—“Consolation.” As he passed thus along Broadway, buried in his thoughts, and utterly unconscious of the scene around him, he felt a hand press his own. He awoke from his thoughts, stopped and looked around. The crowd was hurrying by, but the person who pressed his hand had disappeared. Was that pressure of the hand a mere freak of the imagination? No; for the hand of the unknown had left within the hand of the priest, a neatly folded letter, upon which, in a fair and delicate hand, was written his own name. Stepping aside from the crowd, he opened and read the letter. It was very brief, but its contents called a glow to the pale cheek of the priest. He at once retraced his steps, and passed down Broadway, with a rapid and eager step. Hurrying through the gay crowd, he turned in a few moments into a street leading to the North river. The sun was setting, and cast the shadow of his slender form, long and black, over the pavement, as he paused in front of a stately mansion. He once more examined the letter, and then surveyed the mansion. “It is the same,” he said, and ascended the lofty steps and rang the bell. “Truly, the office of a priest is a painful one,” the thought crossed his mind, “he sees so much misery that he has not the power to relieve—misery under the rags of the hovel, and despair under the velvet of the palace.” A male servant in livery answered the bell, and glanced somewhat superciliously at the faded attire of the priest. But he inclined his head in involuntary respect as the priest said simply— “I am Father Luke.” “This way, sir. You are expected,” answered the servant, and he led Father Luke along a lofty hall, and into a parlor, over whose rich furniture shone dimly the light of the setting sun. “Remain here, sir, and I will announce your coming.” He left the priest alone. Father Luke placed his hat upon a table, and seated himself in a chair. In a moment, resting his cheek upon his hand, and turning his eyes to the light (which shone through the curtained windows) he was buried in thought again. His singular and remarkable face stood forth from the background of shadow, like a portrait from another age. His crown was bald, but his forehead was encircled by dark hair, streaked with silver. As the light shone over that broad brow, and upon the great eyes, dilating in their sunken sockets, he seemed not like a practical man of the nineteenth century, but like one of those penitents or enthusiasts, who, in a dark age, shut up the fires of their agony, of tempted hope or undying remorse, within the shadows of a cloister. “This way, sir,”—it was the voice of the servant, who touched him respect fully on the shoulder as he spoke. Father Luke arose and followed him from the room, and up a broad stairway, and along a corridor. “At the end of this passage you will find a door. Open it and enter. You are expected there.” Passing from the corridor, lighted by the window in its extremity, the priest entered a narrow passage, where all was dark, and pursued his way, until his progress was terminated by a door. He opened the door and crossed the threshhold, but upon the very threshold stood spell-bound in surprise. It was a large apartment, with lofty walls, and instead of the cheerful rays of the declining sun, it was illuminated by a lamp with a clouded shade, which, suspended from the centre of the ceiling, shed around a soft and mysterious light. The walls were not papered nor panelled, but covered with hangings of a dark color. One part of the spacious chamber was occupied by a couch, with a high canopy, and curtains whose snowy whiteness stood out distinctly from the dark background. A wood fire was burning under the arch of the old-fashioned fireplace; and a mirror, in a frame of dark walnut, reflected the couch with its white canopy, and a table covered with a white cloth, which stood directly underneath the hanging lamp. Upon the white cloth was placed a crucifix, a book, a wreath of flowers. The place was perfectly still, and the soft rays of the lamp, investing all its details with mingled light and shadow, gave an atmosphere of mystery to the scene. Father Luke stood on the threshold, hesitating whether to advance or retreat, when a low voice broke the stillness: “Come in, sir; I have waited for you.” And, for the first time, Father Luke took notice of the presence of the speaker. It was a woman, who, attired in black, sat in a rocking chair near the table, her hands folded over her breast. Her head and face were covered by a thick veil of white lace, which fell to her shoulders, contrasting strongly with her sombre attire. Father Luke entered and seated himself in a vacant chair which stood near the table. Resting his arm on the table, (he sat directly beneath the lamp, in a circle of shadow,) and shading his eyes with his hand, he silently surveyed the woman, over whom the light fell in full radiance. There was dark hair, there were bright eyes beneath that veil of lace, a young, richly moulded form, beneath that garb of sable—but in vain he endeavored to trace the features of the unknown. “You received a letter?” said the lady in a low voice. “As I was passing up Broadway, a few moments since, a letter was placed in my hand, bidding my presence at this house, on an errand of life and death.” She started at the sound of that sonorous and hollow voice, and, through her veil seemed to survey him earnestly. I am glad that you have come. I thank you with all my soul. Although not a member of your church, I have heard of you for a long time, and heard of you as one who, having suffered much himself, was especially fitted to render consolation to the heart-broken and despair-stricken. Now, I am heart-broken and despairing;” she paused; “I am dying”— “Dying?” he echoed. “And I have sent for you, believing you to be an honest man, not to hear confession of my sins, for they are too dark to be told or be forgiven; but to ask you a simple question, which I implore you to answer not as a priest but as a man—to answer not with the set phrases of your vocation, but frankly and fully, even as you wish to have peace yourself in the hour of death”— “And that question”—the priest's head bent low upon his breast, and he surveyed her earnestly with his eyes hidden beneath his down-drawn brows. “Do you believe in any hereafter? Do you believe in another world? Does the death of the body end the story? Or, after the death of the body, does the soul rise and live again, in a new, a diviner life?” “My sister,” said the priest, with much emotion, “I know that there is a hereaf ter—I know that the death of the body is not the end of all, but simply the first step in an eternal pilgrimage”— “This you say as a man, and not as a priest—this is your true thought, as you wish to have peace in the hour of your death?” “Even so,” said Father Luke. “Thank you, O, bless you with all my soul. One question more—O, answer me with the same frankness—in the next world shall we meet and know the friends whom we have loved in this?” “We shall meet, we shall know, we shall love them in the next world, as certainly as we ever met, knew and loved them in this,” was the answer of Father Luke, given with all the force and earnestness of undeniable sincerity. Do you think we gather affections to our heart, only to bury them in the grave?” The lady rose from her chair. “I thank you once more, and with all my soul. Your words come from your heart. They confirm the intuitions of my own heart. For the consolation which those words afford, accept the gratitude of a dying woman. And now,” she extended her hand, “and now, farewell!” The priest, who, through this entire interview, had never ceased to regard her, with his eyes almost hidden by his down-drawn brows—struggling all the while to repress an agitation which increased every moment, and well-nigh mastered him—the priest also rose with these words on his lips: “You dying, sister? You seem young and full of life, and with the prospect of long years before you.” It was either the impulse of madness, or the force of a calm conviction, which induced her to reply— “In one hour I will be dead!” The priest silently took her offered hand, and at the same instant emerged from the circle of shadow into the full glow of the light. There was something like magic in the pressure of their hands. And the woman lifted her veil, disclosing a beautiful face, which, already touched with the pallor of death, was lighted by dark eyes, whose brightness was almost supernatural. Lifting her gaze heavenward, she said, as though thinking aloud— “In another world, Ernest, I will meet, I will know, I will love you!” But ere the words had passed her lips —yes, as the slowly lifted veil disclosed her face—the priest sank back, as though stricken by a blow from an iron hand, uttering a wild and incoherent cry— sunk back as though the grave had yielded up its dead, and confronted him with a form, linked with holy, and yet accursed memories. “O, Frank, is it thus we meet!” he cried, and fell on his knees, and buried his face in his hands. CHAPTER XI. The sound of his voice at once lifted the scales from her eyes—she knew him, and the vague consciousness of his presence, which had agitated her for the past few moments, became certainty. She knew that in Father Luke, who knelt before her, she beheld Ernest Walworth, her plighted husband. Sad and terrible, indeed, must have been the change which had fallen upon his countenance, that she did not know him, when he first sat before her in the shadow. Trembling in every nerve, and yet strong with the energy of a soul that had taken its farewell of this life, she gave utterance to her feelings in a single word—his own name—pronounced in the soft low tones of other days. “Ernest!” “O, Frank, Frank, is it thus we meet?” he cried in wild agony, as he raised his face. “You—you—the only woman that I ever loved—you, whose very memory has torn my heart since that fatal hour when I met you in the accursed haunt of death.” “Ernest, you will sit by me as I die, you will press your hand in forgiveness on my forehead, my last look shall encounter yours—” She opened her dark robe, and disclosed the snow-white dress which she wore beneath it. That dress was a shroud. Yes, the beautiful form, the bosom which had once been the home of a pure and stainless love, and which had beat with the throb of sensual passion, were now attired in a shroud. “Behold me, attired for the grave!” she said—and the tears started to her eyes! “This morning, resolved to quit this life, which for me has been a life of unutterable shame and despair, I prepared for my departure. Everything is ready. Come, Ernest, and behold the preparations for my bridal.” She pointed to the couch; he rose and followed her. “I am in love with death, and will wed him ere an hour is gone.” She drew aside the curtains, and upon the white coverlet Ernest beheld a dark object—a coffin covered with black cloth, and glittering with a silver plate. “Everything is ready, Ernest, and I am going. Nay, do not weep, do not attempt to touch my hand. I am but a poor, polluted thing, a wreck, a miserable, miserable wreck! My touch would pollute you. I am not worthy your tears.” Ernest hid his face in the hangings of the couch. He writhed in agony. “You shall not die! you must be saved!” he wildly exclaimed. She walked across the floor with an even step, and in a moment she was seated in the rocking-chair, with Ernest before her, his face hidden in his hands. Her face grew paler every moment; her eyes brightened; and the shroud which enveloped her bosom began to quiver with the last pulsations of her dying heart. As the veil mingled its fleecy folds with her raven hair, she looked very beautiful; yes, beautiful with the touch of death. And as Ernest, choked with his agony, sat before her, hiding his face, she talked in a calm, even tone: “Oh, life! life! you have been a bitter draught to me, and now I'm about to leave you! All day I have been thinking of my shame, of my crimes—I have summoned up every act of my life, the images of the past have walked before me, in a sad funeral procession. O, Thou who didst forgive the Magdalene? Thou who hadst compassion on the poor wretch whose cross arose beside thine own—Thou who dost know all my life, my temptations and my crimes—forgive! forgive! It is a wandering child, sick of wandering, who now, O Thou All-merciful! gathers up the wreck of a miserable life, and lays it, with all its sins and shames, at Thy feet!” As she uttered this simple, yet awful prayer, Ernest did not raise his face. The agony which shook him was too deep for words. Her voice grew faint and fainter, as she went on in a vague and rambling way— “And I was so innocent once, and did not know what sorrow was, and felt such gladness at the sight of the sky, of the stars, of the flowers—at the very breath of spring upon my cheek! O, I wonder if the old home stands there yet; and the nook in the forest; don't you remember it, Ernest? I was so happy, so happy, then! And now I am dying —dying! but you are near. You forgive me, Ernest, do you not?” “Forgive you!” he echoed, raising his face, and spreading forth his clasped hands; God's blessing and His consolation be upon you now and forever. And His curse,” a look of hatred, which stamped every lineament of his face, revealed the intensity of his soul, “and His curse be upon those who brought you to this!” As he spoke, the death-damps began to glisten on her forehead; a glassy look began to veil the intense brightness of her eyes. “Your hand—sit by me”—she said faintly, I shall sleep soon.” He drew his chair to her side, and softly put his hand upon her forehead— it was cold as marble. “It is good to go thus—with Ernest by me—and in token of forgiveness, too, with his hand upon my forehead—” Her words were here interrupted by a footstep and a voice— “Frank! Frank! where are you? I have triumphed—triumphed! The one child is out of my way, and the other is in my power!” It was Colonel Tarleton, who rushed to the light, his face lividly pale, and disfigured with wounds, his right arm carried in a sling. He had not seen his daughter since the hour when he left her home, before the break of day; and now, faint with loss of blood, and yet strong in the consciousness of his triumph, he rushed into the death-room of his child. “I have had a hard time, Frank, but the game is won! The estate is ours! The other son of Gulian Van Huyden is in my power—” The words died on his lips. He be held the dark form of the stranger, and the face of his dying child. The young form clad in a shroud, the countenance pale with death, the large eyes, whose brightness was veiled in a glassy film— he saw this sad picture at a glance, but could not believe the evidence of his senses. “Why, Frank, what's all this?” he cried, as, with his pale face marked by wounds, he stood before his daughter. She slowly raised her eyes, and regarded him with a sad smile: “The poison, father—I drank it myself— he went forth from this house, safe from all harm—” Her voice failed. Tarleton uttered a frightful cry, and fell like a dead man on the floor, his face against the carpet. The reality of the scene had burst upon him; in the hour of his triumph he saw his schemes—the plans woven through the long course of twenty-one years, and darkened by hideous crimes—leveled in a moment to the dust. Frank slowly turned her head, and fixed her glassy eyes upon the face of Ernest. O, the intensity of that long and yearning gaze! “I am weary and cold,” she gasped, but it is light yonder.” And that was all. Her eyes became fixed—she laid her head gently on her shoulder and fell asleep. She was dead. Ernest knelt beside her, and with his eyes flashing from their sunken sockets, he clasped his hands, and uttered a prayer for the dead. The prayer was said, and Ernest rose —his face all fixed as marble his eyes all tearless; and in an absent way placed his hand upon the head of the dead woman, smoothed her dark hair, put his kiss upon her clammy forehead, and closed those eyes which had looked their last upon this world. And she sat there, in her death-chair, cold and dead, but very beautiful, this sad child of shame. Ernest, resting his hands upon the arm of the chair, hid his face from the light. Was he praying—was he endeavoring to pierce the shadows of the other world, and follow the wrecked spirit to that throne where justice is more tender than the tenderest mercy of man? A voice broke the dead stillness, and a livid face was uplifted from the floor— “It's an infernal dream, Frank, all a dream! The estate is ours! One heir by this time is dead—the other in my power! You could not, no! no!— you could not have put the poison to your lips, instead of to his for whom it was designed; you could not have been so mad. The estate is ours! This talk about your dying is all a dream—all—.” He saw, at the same glance, even as he wildly raved, the bended head of Ernest, and the pale dead face of the Midnight Queen. Baffled schemer! Of all the plots and crimes of twenty-one years, behold the end! The game which you have played was a dark one, but altogether cunning and full of wisdom, worldly wisdom— but it was only cunning, only full of worldly wisdom—and now, you see that death and fate are triumphant. Bow your head, baffled schemer! and hide your livid face from the light, while your dead daughter sits erect in the death-chair. “Why thus sadly bring this story to a close? Why not rather save your heroine from temptation and crime—link her hand in that of Ernest—crown them with the joys of wedded love, shed upon them the baptism of the holy light of home?” Because, reader, it is not a sto ry, but a narrative. Look around the world. In how many cases do you find virtue triumphant and vice defeated? It is well, right well, that beyond the darkness of this life there is mercy and justice, and the songs of angels; that there, for the trampled heart of the tempted and the fallen, is—consolation. On some Sabbath day, when the smoke of the incense and the music of high mass fill the cathedral of * * * you may note among the faces which encircle the altar—even as the host is lifted over the heads of the kneeling thousands—one face which strikes you, not so much with its deathly pallor, its hollow cheeks, and eyes burning feverishly in their sunken sockets, as with its look of utter and irrevocable despair. It is the face of one who, when life, and more than life, was blasted at the core, still had that noblest courage of all—the courage to live on—Father Luke, once called Ernest Walworth. And— On some June day, if you will thread the path that winds up among the Palisades—in sight of Tappan Bay—you may pick a summer flower from an obscure grave, which rests in the shadows of a forest-nook, its simple headstone bearing no other record than the name— “Frank.” END OF MIDNIGHT QUEEN.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE LIFE OF A MAN OF THE WORLD WRITTEN BY HIMSELF. CHAPTER XII. [Note—“The Life of a Man of the World!” To show how the warm and earnest hope of youth is chilled, by circumstance and bitter experience, into the cold, calculating spirit of middle-age—something like this is the object of the present narrative. Like the history of “The Midnight Queen,” this is also an autobiography, and its hero, like the heroine of the former narrative, is named Frank; but Frank, the Man of the World, is an altogether different character from Frank, the pure, and impassioned, and betrayed woman. But let the Man of the World tell his story for himself, in his own way.] My family was one of the oldest in the State of New-York; one of those indeed which, dating from the days of Dutch ascendency, pride themselves more upon blood than money. I was just twenty-one, when, having completed my collegiate course at Harvard, I returned home, my heart filled with the brightest anticipations. My father was wealthy, my cousin Eva beautiful, and she loved me—thus ran my thoughts—and as soon as I get home I will marry Eva. Night had fallen, as, landing at the Battery, I took my way along Broadway toward my father's mansion, one of those lordly palaces of the upper regions of New-York. As I picked my way, by the flaring gas-lights, what a world of fancies rushed upon me, and, amid them all, Eva's face, with its clear hazel eyes and auburn hair! Arrived at home, I found my father sitting alone in the front parlor; he was reading by the light of a shaded lamp. He greeted me warmly, and shading his eyes with his hand, contemplated me long and attentively. “Why, my boy, you have grown quite handsome! A student and handsome— quite odd, I declare!” At this time I was about the medium height, my frame broad in the shoulders and slender in the waist, my step elastic, and as to my face, it partook of the mingled Dutch and Spanish lineage of our family—clear complexion, dark hair and brows, aquiline features, and eyes of deep brown. My father, of course, being near sixty, was a man of altogether different appearance. In former years he had been famed for his manly beauty, but age and habits of epicurean ease, had rendered him portly, almost obese. His features were full and florid, his hair white as snow. As he leaned back in his chair, crossing his foot over a second chair, lifting his eye-glass with one hand, while the other held the newspaper, he looked the very picture of a good-natured, self-complacent man of the world. “You have grown quite handsome,” said he; “and now, my dear Frank, having graduated with all the honors, and so forth, let me know what you intend to do?” I at once, seated familiarly by his side, opened my plans to him; spoke of his wealth; of my determination to marry my cousin, and then to pursue the study of the law. He listened with one eye half closed, one finger laid gently on his nose, giving no sign of his sentiments further than an occasional “hum!” “You are wealthy, father. Eva's family are wealthy; we are suited to each other; and once married to Eva I can pursue my profession, and gain distinction at the bar.” Thus I remarked, when my father interrupted me. “This is all very well reasoned, and looks bright, but we will talk of it to-morrow. By the bye, Frank, do me a favor. You are tired, I know, but I am sure you will not deny me. On this card is written the address of a tenant, whose rent is long in arrears. I wish you would take a carriage at once, proceed to the house, see the party, and ascertain 3 definitely about the probable time when the money will be paid.” This was a singular request. “Why not entrust the matter to your regular agent?” I began, when my father interrupted me with an impetuous wave of his hand, and the words, “Not a word more, Frank. Do me the favor,” and took up his paper. Without a word, I put the card in my pocket, wrapped my cloak around me, (it was a clear, cold winter night,) and left the room and the house. I soon secured a hack, and directed the driver to proceed as fast as possible to the house whose number was on the card—it was some two miles from the head of Broadway, being out in the half inhabited regions of the Sixth avenue. As the carriage rolled on its way, I gave myself up to all sorts of waking dreams, Eva's face prominent among all. At last the carriage stopped, and I found myself in front of a row of three-story brick houses, which stood alone on a street newly laid out, near the avenue. Dismounting from the carriage, I cast a glance around the gloomy region, which, by the light of a cloudy winter night, presented only an indistinct view of unfinished buildings, varying the surface of a large plain, terminated by the Hudson river, and then ascended the step of the house designated on the card. I rang the bell—soon a tall female with a handkerchief tied about her head appeared. “Is the lady or gentlemen of the house,” I did'nt know which to name, “within?” “Yer business, sur,” was the response. “I wish to see the person of the house,” said I, firmly. “Then walk this way, Sur,” was the reply, and I was led into an entry, and from thence into a small parlor, neatly furnished, and lighted only by a coal fire burning in the grate. Seating myself on the sofa, I occupied myself in wondering about the occupant of the house, as to who he or she might be; and this train of thought exhausted, I busied myself in picturing Eva's beautiful face, amid the embers of the coal fire. My reverie was abruptly broken. A light suddenly mingled with the rays of the fire, and on the threshold of the door that led into the next room, stood a beautiful girl, not more than eighteen years old, dressed in a garment of white muslin, her hair unbound, and her uplifted hand holding a candle above her head. Certainly she was very beautiful. Below the medium height, her bosom prominent, her waist lithe and pliant, her shape full in its outlines, her hands and feet exquisitely small. She was one of those women, whose rich complexion, moist red lips, and deep blue gray eyes, speak at once of the purity of the maiden—the passion of the matured woman. “Whom did you wish to see?” she asked, lifting the candlestick with one hand, and shading her eyes with the other. “Eva!” I cried, bounding from the sofa and folding her in my arms. She uttered a faint cry, and sunk half fainting on my breast. The candlestick had fallen to the floor, and I could only see her blushing face by the light of the coal fire. I bore her to the sofa, seated her by my side, and cradled her head on my breast; there was a moment of voiceless passion. I kissed her on the lips, the cheeks, the brow—nay, kissed the waves of her glossy brown hair. Then raising her head from my breast, even as her arms clung convulsively about my neck, I suffered my gaze to devour her young and glowing countenance. “Eva, darling, you were always beautiful, but now you are an angel!” Her eyes were downcast, she did not meet my gaze, but, unwinding her arms from my neck, crossed her hands on her lap, and sat silent and trembling by my side. This sudden change of manner confounded me. I overwhelmed her with questions: “Do you not love me, Eva? What has happened to wound you? Why do I find you here, in this lonely house?” She at length raised her eyes; they were filled with tears. “O Frank,” she said, “O Frank, has not your father told you all?” “Told me all?” I echoed in vague wonder. And then in a voice broken by sobs with eyes now downcast, and now raised in imploring entreaty to my face, while her hands alternately clasped her unbraided hair, and pulled at the ruffles of her robe, she told me the cause of her agitation. “A week ago father died—died insolvent. The day after his death the creditors took possession of our house. Mother and I sought the advice of your father, he was rich, he would protect us until your return—so we thought. And your father —” “And my father, —” “And your father informed us that he was on the brink of insolvency. All his future was gone—the very house in which he lived `hopelessly mortgaged.' `My dear Eva,' said he, `rich as I seem to be. I am something worse than a beggar.'” She paused—I need not say that this news fell on me like the stroke of a thunderbolt. But nervously anxious to hear the sequel of the story, I could only beg her to proceed. “And then, expatiating on the hopeless poverty which had suddenly fallen on both of our families, he begged me, without delay—” she stopped, and gasped for breath—“to repair our fallen fortunes by a marriage. A Wall-street merchant, twice my age, and very rich, had spoken to him about me—was willing, at once, to marry me. This merchant was one of your father's largest creditors —once married to me, he would not press his claim. And, Frank—oh! I shall sink into the floor—I cannot go on!” She buried her face on her bosom, and burst into tears. As for me, my heart grew like ice. “And you consented to marry him?” I faltered. Her voice was death-like, as she replied: “Yes. To save your father from ruin, to save you and myself from the calamity of a marriage which would condemn you to hopeless poverty, I consented. This morning we were married in Trinity Church, and to-night—yes, within an hour—my husband will come, to bear me from this house (where, with mother, I have lived since father's death) to his own splendid mansion.” She could say no more; she flung herself upon the arm of the sofa, and gave full vent to her agony. As for me, I was paralyzed. “Eva married to another, who will come within an hour to bear her to his mansion, there to gather to his embrace the woman whom he has bought.” It was this thought which seemed written in letters of fire upon my brain. Suddenly the bell rang; Eva started up, pale and shuddering. “O Frank, it is he—Mr. Walmer—my husband! What shall we do? He must not see you—he must not see you!” Conscious that I was pale as death, I rose from the sofa. My resolution was taken. “Eva, I will answer the bell,” I said, and grasped her wrist,—“nay, not a word, I am resolved.” And forcing her to a seat upon the sofa, I left the room and hurried along the entry to the front door. “Mr. Walmer—and so it is that red-faced bon-vivant, who has purchased Eva!” the thought ran through my mind. “Well, Mr. Walmer! You shall never cross this threshold!” Firmly resolved to lay him dead at my feet, ere he crossed the threshold, I opened the door. “Does Mrs. Walmer live here?” said a voice—it was not the voice of the portly Mr. Walmer, but of a thick-set servant in livery. “Yes.” “Here is a note for her, from Mr. Walmer. It does not require an answer,” and before I had time to say a word, the thick-set servant went down the steps and disappeared. I closed the door, reentered the parlor, and gave the note to Eva; she was pale as death, as, bending toward the fire, she opened it, and perused its contents. And then, with a faint cry, she fell insensible to the floor. It may be guessed that I grasped the note from her fingers, and madly devoured its contents. Judge of my surprise when I read:— CHAPTER XIII. “New-York, Dec. 16, 1842. “My Pretty Wife:— “I am called away this afternoon to Havana on important business it admits of not a single hour's delay—and if I succeed in the speculation which I have in my eye, I will clear some ?300,000. When you read this, I will be on board the steamer off Sandy Hook. I will be absent from four to five weeks. You will at once remove from the house which yourself and mother now occupy, and take possession of my town mansion in Broadway. The servants have the requisite orders; everything will be at your command. And don't fret yourself to death in my absence, darling. Yours, &amp;c., &amp;c. “Caleb Walmer.” Here was indeed food for thought! The sensuality of the bon-vivant had, for a time, yielded to his avarice. Eva was respited for at least four weeks— respited from a fate worse than death. I was almost mad with joy. Raising her gently from the floor, I bore her to the sofa, and cradled her in my arms, as though she had been a child, and awoke her back to life by my passionate and burning kisses. “O Frank, is it not all a dream—the letter, the letter!” were the first words which she said. I placed the letter in her hand; she read it again, and then raised a face to me all radiant and joyous. Her bosom heaved over the folds of her robe—her eyes shone with deep light. “And you will go and reside in his splendid mansion?” I whispered. “No,” she answered softly, with downcast eyes, “I will remain in this house— this house, which mother and I purchased and rented with money derived from the wreck of father's estate. Mother is sick in bed, up-stairs, prostrated by a nervous attack, and needs all my care.” While thus speaking, she had gently disengaged herself from my arms, and took her seat, at a short distance from me, on the sofa. She was very beautiful, and the light of the fire cast a soft glow over her face, her dark hair, and dress, spotless as snow. For a few moments, silence prevailed—a silence painful and embarrassing to both of us. I was afraid to speak—even afraid to decrease the slight distance which separated us. At last, I said to her in a low voice, as we sat alone in that quiet parlor— “Eva, what is marriage?” I saw her bosom heave and her color come and go. “Is it a ceremony performed in Trinity Church, between a purchaser and his purchase, by a priest who acts as auctioneer? Or is it the consummation of a holy vow, made in childhood, by two young hearts, whom God has destined for each other?” I paused—threading her hands in an absent manner, through the waves of her unbound hair, she remained silent— but for a moment only. She rose, radiant as much with her virgin purity, as with her passionate loveliness of look and shape—she rose, and came gently to me, laying one hand on each of my shoulders, and bending down until her bosom beat against my cheek. “You are my husband,—you only,”— and she pressed her lips to mine. * * The intense delight, the holy passion of that hour, I shall never forget. And the hours glided away, unperceived, while we lost ourselves in one of those waking dreams, which never happen to the same person twice in a lifetime. “Father!”—it was thus I soliloquized, as, passing from the home of Eva, after midnight, I re-entered the carriage— “Father! you are a man of the world, and a worldly-wise man; so is your friend Walmer,—both cunning men. Eva and I are but children, but somehow I think we are ahead of you, this time.” I did not meet my father until next morning at breakfast. The table was spread for two, and we sat alone, facing each other, in the elegant breakfast room, where the rays of the morning sun were tempered by closely drawn curtains. How calm and self-possessed he looked in his snow-white ruffles and embroidered dressing-gown, as, cracking an egg in the glass, he regarded me curiously, one eye half closed! “Well, Frank, did you see the tenant?” he said quietly. “I did, father,” and, imitating his nonchalance, slowly sipped my coffee. He evidently expected a burst of rage from me; but my mother's blood predominated in my veins, and I met his Dutch phlegm with the cautiousness of the Spaniard. A long pause ensued. “Zounds! why don't you talk?” he cried at last, setting his cup on the table, with a sort of china-ware emphasis—a kind of crockery “damn.” “Do you blame me for having married Eva, and married her well, rich, and so-forth, thus saving both you and her from a poor marriage and its consequences?” “No doubt you acted for the best, father,” I answered quietly. “By this time, Frank, you are aware that I am something worse than a beggar. As for her father, he died insolvent. It becomes us to look around us. Eva's marriage secures her, and will give us, for some time longer, possession of this house, for Walmer holds the mortgage. And as for you, Frank, you have a fine person—quite an air, education, and so-forth—you musn't think of the law. A rich marriage is the thing for you. It will set us all up, my boy.” “Do you think so?” I exclaimed. My father broke another egg in his cup: “Now, I know a West Indian lady —Mrs. De Wolf—a trifle older than you—her husband is dead, and she is a widow, immensely rich. Rich enough to buy the park for a pleasure garden, or have a full-grown nigger for breakfast, every morning, if she chooses. I have transacted some business for her, and know that she is anxious for a husband; a young one, one who has style. In fact, I have spoken to her of you, and —” He was interrupted by the entrance of a person who bounced into the room very much like a bombshell. It was a very short lady, broad in the shoulders, very ample in the form, with a dark complexion, somewhat spotted, a hooked nose, and very dark hair, which, like her white teeth, evidently belonged to some person long since deceased. She was richly dressed in black, and ornamented all over with diamonds. As if unconscious that fifty years had robbed her bosom of its virgin outline and alabaster hues, she dressed in such a manner that it was half exposed, and there it was heaving, like a half-stagnant wave, with a heavy diamond necklace glittering over it. At college we were wont to compare anything peculiarly indescribable to the “Devil before Day,” and I certainly thought that, at last, I beheld that personage in the female before me. “How d'ye do, my dear Van Warner? Up late last night at the opera, but thought I'd make an early call! How well you are looking! Bless me, is this your son? quite handsome, I vow! Introduce me, Van Warner!” thus rattling on, in pretty good English, marked by a Spanish accent, she lifted her eye-glass, and surveyed me as coolly as though I had been a blood horse: “Elegant form, dark hair and whiskers, and quite the chivalresque cast of face. I vow, Frank, I'm in love with you already!” She spent the day with my father, conversing about matters connected with her estates in Jamaica and Cuba. CHAPTER XIV. And before the day had passed I had made up my mind as to my future,—remember, I am not writing a novel, but the plain, may be, humiliating story of a real life. I had resolved to marry the Hon. Mrs. De. Wolf. Without money I could not protect Eva; my father was bankrupt, and the thought of the manner in which Eva had been sold, had destroyed not only the freshness of my principles, but also of my nice sense of honor. I found myself compelled to look at the world, as a game, as a battle whose first word and whose last was “MONEY!” I consented to marry the widow. My prominent object, to possess Eva at all hazards, and keep her as my true wife, sacred, secret, and apart from the world; I married the widow, in order to obtain possession of her fortune. This was base, it will be said; but look at the examples which I had around me, in high life; look at my father, deliberately selling my betrothed wife into the arms of avarice and lust! I wish to spare myself, as far as possible, a recital of the details of the disgusting mockery of my marriage. It took place in the mansion of Mrs. De Wolf; an aristocratic structure, furnished in oriental splendor. There was a marriage party and throngs of guests—the rich, the fashionable of New-York. How I was envied! The husband of the rich widow, that is, the absolute possessor of half a million dollars! And then the bridal chamber, carpeted with the product of oriental looms, and lined with hangings of light crimson satin,—everything in it spoke of the immense wealth of my wife! The bridal bed with satin coverlet and a canopy whose folds resembled clouds of floating mist, seemed worthy of the holiest nuptials. Across the threshold of this chamber, as the sound of music and dancing was heard in the hall below, I led the trembling widow,—fair as the witch of Endor, modest as Messalina. Hag! Would that I had strangled her on the threshhold! For two or three days after our marriage, her mansion, (now mine,) resounded with the echoes of one continued orgie, in which the light of day or the flaring gas, shone upon the faces of our guests, as they sat at dinner, or joined in the dance, or drank deep of the rich wines from our cellar. What a page of “the high life” in New-York was opened to me! Wealth, and beauty and fashion, were around me—this was the surface only—looking beneath the tinsel veil of the gay world, I beheld unmarried damsels of great beauty and wealth, who were virgins, in the same sense as the poor wretch of the side-walk; married women, of wealth and beauty, too, who had made a science of adultery; husbands, who saw their own dishonor and winked at it; and libertines, who, clad with wealth, came from the brothel to haunts of “topmost fashion” to gratify their appetites. A very glittering and very loathsome world. The fourth day after our marriage, having managed to escape from the loathsome caresses of my “lady-wife,” I was sitting alone in a distant room of our mansion, which had been fitted up as a library. My hands were in my pockets, my feet on the fender, my eyes centered on the fire—I was in a brown study. My father entered; it was the first time I had met him alone since the marriage. Dressed in the extreme of fashion, he seated himself by me, and slapped me on the shoulder; “happy dog!” said he,— “married, settled in life, a capital of half a million—interest, ?30,000 per year.” “Happy dog!” I echoed. “By the bye, Frank, I forgot to ask you the particulars of your visit to that tenant, on the night of your arrival. I wished to cure you of your passion for little Eva. And knowing that the dear little girl had besought Walmer to permit her to spend the latter part of the wedding-day, and the first hours of the bridal evening, at her mother's house, I dispatched you there, so as you might see her, before Walmer came to take her home. Did you see her?” “I saw Eva.” “Didn't you encounter Walmer?” “I did not. While sitting alone with Eva, a note came from Mr. Walmer, stating that he had been obliged, by important business, to leave for Havana that very afternoon.” “The devil!” cried my father. “This is indeed odd!” “He will be back in four or five weeks.” “And Eva, meanwhile, takes possession of his mansion, eh? of course.” “Eva remains with her mother” I replied calmly, still keeping my feet on the fender. “But, why not go at once to her husband's mansion?” said my father. For the first time in this interview, I turned and looked my father in the face. Certainly, with his portly form, elegant blue coat with metal buttons, spotless ruffles, florid face, and white hair, he was a well-preserved `old man of the world.' As he looked at me with his eye-glass raised, I steadily returned his glance, and said calmly: “Best of fathers! In everything hitherto you have had your own way. You married Eva to money, and you have married your own son also to money. You have had your own way hitherto; allow me now to have mine. Eva has not gone to Mr. Walmer's mansion, because she never intends to go there. Eva is to all purposes my wife, my only wife. And the wealth which I have gained by my bargain with the madam, I will devote to the comfort of Eva, and especially to keeping her out of the reach of Mr. Walmer. And, best of fathers! make up your mind, at once, that you had better put your head among the live coals in that grate, than to attempt to cross me.” So saying, I took a cigar from the mantel and lighted it. My father did not grow pale, but his face became spotted. He was speechless. “But,” said he at last, choking with rage, “suppose I inform your wife, the late Mrs. De Wolf, of all this?” “As you please, father,” said I, smoking away. “Only remember, that such information will be considered by me in the light of a declaration of war.” My father seized his hat and rushed from the room. As for me, dressing myself in a plain drab overcoat, and pulling a cap over my brows, I went stealthily from my big mansion, called a hack, and ordered the hackman to drive to the house near the avenue. I arrived there after dark. The place was lonely, and the sky, covered with leaden clouds, gave an uncertain light to the surrounding space. I rang the bell. It was Eva herself who answered it; Eva, dressed in the same dress of plain white, with her rich brown hair, disposed in thick masses about her face. Without a word she took my hand, and led me into the back parlor. It had been a week since I saw her last. She raised her beaming eyes and radiant face to me. “O Frank, I am so glad to see you!” she said, and placed her head against my breast. Certainly, I loved with that mingling of the intensely pure and the intensely passionate, which makes up the affection with which we regard an adored and yet respected wife. I took her on my knee, laid her cheek to mine, threaded my fingers through her hair—in short, committed all those follies which are only follies when written or told again. Supremely happy in her presence, in the light of her eyes, I forgot the world—my dear father and hag-wife included. “And your mother, Eva?” “She has never been well since the day of father's death, and has not slept for many nights. An hour ago, she sank into the first sleep which she has had for days and nights.” Hardly had the words passed from her lips when a cry, short and piercing, resounded through the house. To follow Eva from the room, to ascend the narrow stairs, to pass with her into the sick chamber, was all the work of a few instants. Never shall I forget that scene! The sick woman, clad in her nightclothes, sat up in her couch, her eyes flaming with delirium. Her cheeks were hollowed; her black hair, streaked with gray, fell over her bared shoulders. At a glance, I saw that she was struggling in the last agony. “Eva! Frank!” she cried. We darted forward,—she looked at us long and anxiously—and then, joining our hands, seemed about to speak, when her face changed and her eyes became fixed and glassy. She was dead even as she sat up in the couch. Her last act had been to join our hands; her last look was cast upon our faces. * * I remained with Eva until after midnight, and then, consigning her to the care of the servant (a rough but kind-hearted Irish-woman), I returned home. Said my “lady-wife” as we sat next morning at breakfast—“You were not at the opera last night, dearest?” To which I replied, simply, “Dearest, I was not.” My lady-wife's eyes shot fire. As soon as possible I sought my father, and took him to my private room, and informed him of the decease of Eva's mother. “Will you attend the funeral?” I asked. “Not in my way, Frank, not in my way. Leave it all to you. And, look you, do what you please, I wont cross you. Only secure me an allowance from your estate; and,” he put his mouth to my ear, “between Walmer and your wife, you have a hard card to play. Keep shady! For Walmer on his return will pick up a lawsuit, and as for your wife, she may make your coffee too strong, gad! quite too strong!” Having given this advice, with a wink and a chuckle, he promised to apologize to my wife for my absence during the day. Towards evening that day, a hearse, followed by a single carriage, took its way toward our family cemetery, some ten miles from New-York, in a sheltered nook near the Hudson. In the drear winter twilight, Eva and I joined hands above her mother's grave. As a simple-hearted clergyman read the service, the words sighed mournfully among the withered branches; and through the intervals of the trees came a glimpse of the broad Hudson, rolling in long waves, each wave tinted with the last glow of the departing day. * * I accompanied Eva home. “Frank, you are all I have in the world,” she said, falling on my breast, as soon as we entered the house. O how the memory of that hour comes over me, as I write these words! Returning to my big house—I cannot say my home—toward midnight, I avoided the presence of my wife (I can scarcely call her) and slept on the sofa, in the library. The next morning, at breakfast, she manifested her usual fondness for me, but there was a cold devilish gleam of suspicion in her eyes. But that day I redoubled my attentions, rode with her along Broadway in our grand carriage, went with her at night to the opera, and then to a fashionable party. I had an object in this, which manifested itself at the breakfast table next morning. “Dearest, urgent business calls me away from you for a week or ten days. I must—nay, do not look angry—I must visit Boston, on business of my father. And I must go to-day.” “Fact, you must go, Frank.” said my father, who had just entered, dressed in his usual gay style—“Don't like to ask it of you, but positively my business will suffer if you don't go.” After much persuasion my “lady-wife” consented, and I went to Boston that day—that is to say, figuratively. As a matter of fact, I bent my steps to the house near the avenue, where Eva welcomed me, her eyes full of tears, but her heart swelling with joy. How shall I picture those days which I passed with Eva, in the house near the avenue! They were the days of my life. We were hidden from the world. No one knew, save my father, of my presence in New-York. And, secluded from the world, in the lonely house, we forgot the world in each other's company. Eva was mistress, wife, idol, to me. She was one of those rare women so hard to describe, whose organizations combine the very extremes of the spiritual and the passionate—whose minds mingle the simplicity of the child with the intuitions of mature woman. The thorough purity of her nature threw over our mutual passion a chastened and holy light. And while we were wrapped in this delicious dream, days and weeks passed away. One stormy evening, when the snow lay deep upon the desolate region about our house, an incident took place which had an important bearing upon our fate. We sat alone in the little front parlor; a comfortable fire was burning in the grate, and an astral lamp upon the table threw around a softened and mellow light. Eva, dressed in white, was sitting on the sofa, and I was seated upon a stool at her feet. My clasped hands rested on her knees, and her little hand was placed gently on my head. As I looked up into her clear tranquil eyes, and caught the magnetism of her gaze, at the same time that I perused the bloom of her lips and cheeks, and the purity of her calm white brow, it seemed to me, that she was the most wondrously beautiful woman in all the world. We sat thus for a long time silent, enjoying the delight of each other's presence, and absorbed in one reverie. She at length broke the silence,— “Frank, I wish we could die now!” she said. Her bosom heaved gently and tears came to her eyes. “Why, Eva?” “We will never again be so happy as now,” she said,—“we never can be happier than we are now. And it seems to me good that we should die now, when our happiness is at the full.” 'Twas a strange thought, and I had no word in reply, but felt in my soul a response to it. Then we again relapsed into our reverie, reverie so deep and so prolonged, that we did not hear the ringing of the door-bell, nor the sound of footsteps in the entry, nor the opening of the parlor door. But, startling like those who are suddenly awakened from a dream, we looked up and beheld our Irish servant in the doorway, and two persons, a lady and a gentleman standing near us, their garments covered with snow. CHAPTER XV. One of these persons was a fat, elderly gentleman, with a bald head and florid face, small eyes, and a pug nose. He was dressed in a drab-colored overcoat or sack, and carried in one hand a gold-headed cane. The other was a short, broad lady, with a prominent hooked nose; she was richly attired in a velvet cloak. I confess, as I looked at them over my shoulder, I heard bells and all sorts of noises in my ears. “My lady-wife!” I ejaculated. As for Eva, she uttered a short quick scream: “Mr. Walmer!” she cried, and fainted on the sofa. It was, in a word, Mr. Walmer, who, by some devil's chance, had returned a week sooner than he had announced, and the late Mrs. De Wolf, my wife, whom some similar devil's chance had brought into contact with Mr. Walmer. And there we were, Eva fainting, Walmer red and choked with rage, my lady-wife looking altogether like a fiend. It was embarrassing. “And this is Boston, is it, sir?” said the short, broad, West Indian madam. “And what in the devil are you doing here with my wife?” remarked the portly man of Wall-street. Now, (I put it to the candor of everybody,) was not my position embarrassing? I felt it was, decidedly. I rose from the stool, passed my hand over my forehead, thought, and then, my course decided upon, confronted the pair. “To what am I indebted for the honor of this visit?” I said, quite politely, at the same time winking at the servant woman, and making a quick, rapid gesture towards Eva. “Scoundrel!” cried Mr. Walmer, “I return home, and find you alone with my wife!” “Villain!” said my lady-wife, “I think you are in Boston, and all the time you are here, consoling yourself with your mistress!” I quietly pulled out my watch. “You have both used certain words which are strikingly absurd. You speak of home, sir,—do you call this house your home? And you, madam, speak of mistress,— dare you apply that word to my cousin?” I advanced a step. “I command you, madam, to return home at once; and as for you, sir”—I darted forward and twisted my hand in his collar, and in an instant had him fixed against the wall,— “I give you just half a second by the watch, to leave my house.” Decidedly I had hit upon a coup d'était. For, as I sprang forward, the Irish servant took the opportunity to seize Eva, and bear her from the room and up stairs to her own chamber, and my West Indian madam stood perfectly paralyzed by my audacity. “Villain! you are choking me,—you shall pay for this,—you—” cried Mr. Walmer, as he was helpless in my grasp. “Will you leave the house?” I responded, tightening my grasp. “Yes,—y-e-s,” he gasped. I took my hand away; he put on his hat and left the room; I followed him to the front door. Arrived there, he swore awfully, threatening suits at law and search warrants, without number. I heard him without reply, and waited quietly on the threshold until he entered his carriage. Then returning to the parlor I confronted madam. She was livid with suppressed rage. “It is your turn now, my dear,” I said, pointing to the door. She fairly shook her fist in my face. “You shall pay for this—you shall pay for this,” she screamed. “No doubt, love,—no doubt,—everything in the world has to be paid for. Good-night!” And I bowed her to the door, and out of the house, and watched her until she entered the carriage. She shook her clenched hand from the window, and the carriage rolled away. I closed the door, and went sadly up stairs to Eva's chamber. I found the poor child sobbing in the arms of the stout Irish servant, who was comforting her, and also swearing fervently at the “ould gentleman wid de bald head” and “the squat ould leddy wid a high head-dress,” —meaning Mr. Walmer and my Madam. “O Frank, Frank! do not let them take me from you,” cried Eva, and fell sobbing on my breast. * * Next morning early, I was at home in my grand city mansion. I directed the servant to inform the madam, that I would do myself the honor of breakfasting with her. Then dressing myself with some care, I retired to the library to await the hour of breakfast. “This morning,” I soliloquized, “Mr. Walmer will visit the house near the avenue with a search-warrant,” —and I laughed to myself. It was near eleven o'clock when the servant came to announce that breakfast was ready in the lilac room. As I descended to the breakfast room, I prepared myself to face my terrible wife.— “Now, for a grand explosion!” But judge of my surprise when, entering the lilac room—a neat little apartment, the walls covered with blue-colored paper, warmed by a wood fire, and lighted by a window opening to the west— my lady-wife greeted me with a cordial “good-morning, dear Frank.” Clad in a sumptuous wrapper, or robe of light blue cloth, with flowing sleeves, she was seated at the breakfast table, her back to the curtained window. I took my seat opposite. Motioning to the solitary servant, to retire to the window, beyond hearing distance, the madam filled my cup with coffee and handed it to me with one of her most gracious smiles, at the same time, leaning confidentially over the table, “Frank, do you know I made a great fool of myself last night? You see this old fool of a Walmer called here last night, and inflamed with a story about you secreting yourself with his young wife, and all that. He persuaded me to accompany him; you know what happened at the house, and how angry I was. Well! coming home in the carriage with Walmer, I discovered that this pretty little girl was your cousin indeed; that she was Walmer's wife only in name; and that he had no proof whatever of improper relations between you. In fact, my dear Frank, I discovered that this Walmer had made me his dupe. But you'll forgive me, this once, dear Frank, wont you?” So bland was her manner, so cordial her accent, that I forgot her wicked little eyes and hooked nose. I almost thought the madam charming. “Your poor little orphan cousin, must come and see me. I can judge your feelings to each other. You are quite brother and sister, I vow. Take another cup, Frank!” I could not help thanking the madam for her kind construction of my conduct, and handed her my cup. She filled it once more with the fragrant coffee, looking at me earnestly and keeping me engaged in conversation all the while. “I know I shall adore that dear little cousin of yours,” she said, as she handed me the cup, and watched me as I raised it to my lips, her small black eyes glittering like points of flame. At my lip, however, I held the cup but did not drink it. I called to the solitary servant, who stood by the window. “Come here, Marie,” I said. This servant was an especial favorite with her mistress. Marie was a slender quadroon girl, with an elegant shape, brown complexion, jet black hair, and large, melancholy black eyes. She was an exceedingly interesting and beautiful girl; and, as has been said, was an especial favorite with her mistress. Had Marie been her own daughter, she could not have treated her more kindly—indeed, there was a story, which had made its way from the West Indies to New-York, that the pretty quadroon was the daughter of the rich madam. “Come here, Marie,” I said. And the brown girl came, and stood by the table, and looked at me with her sad beautiful eyes. “It is a cold morning, my child, and you look chilled,” said I. “Here is some excellent coffee, prepared by my wife. Drink it, Marie, it will do you good.” With a wondering look the girl took the cup and raised it to her lips, and, with a bound like a tigress, and with a scream like the cry of some other wild beast, the madam sprung from her chair and dashed the cup to the floor. The fragments were scattered over the carpet. And then panting, gasping, livid, the Madam sank back into her seat, and trembled, half fainting there, her white lips moving as though she wished to speak, but could not. “What all dis 'bout?” said Marie, making big eyes. “Go from the room,” I said. She obeyed. I rose, locked the door, and put the key in my pocket. “It is between you and me, madam,” said I, approaching the speechless woman. “I will thank you for that little phial which you so adroitly conceal in the folds of your right sleeve, and from which you poured a few drops into my coffee.” “I have no phial,” she gasped, clasping her hands, and crouching in her chair. I made no more ado, but seizing her wrists with a firm grip, I drew from her right sleeve a small silver phial or flagon, which (as I afterwards discovered) contained a subtle and deadly poison. “Miserable woman! Worn out by long years of sensual excess, you purchased me in marriage, so that I might be the instrument of your appetites, or the cloak of your numerous amours. Was this not enough? Are you not satisfied with having degraded me into what I am? Why make me drink from the same phial as Mr. De Wolf, your second, and Mr. Cardenas, your first husband! You would murder me, would you, because I am guilty of preferring, to your loathsome caresses, the love of a pure and stainless girl?” Hoarse with rage I stood over her— she crouching, trembling, and abject in her chair. “Now, mark me! I will place this phial, together with a sealed affidavit of the facts of your attempt to poison me, in the possession of an eminent lawyer, with directions to break the seal, in case of my death. I will so surround you with proofs of your guilt, that in case of my sudden death, you certainly will be tried for murdering me. Meanwhile, I will control your fortune—appear in public as your affectionate husband—wink at your amours, so long as they are not too shameless—but I will not eat at the same table, nor share the same bed with you. Do you understand me, or shall I repeat my words?” “Her livid lips moved, but she could not frame a word. I unlocked the door; Marie, the quadroon, had evidently been listening, for she stood, pale and trembling, on the outside. “Come in, child,” said I, leading her by the hand. “Your poor mother is not well. Go to her.” And I left them together. From that time, the madam was as submissive and cowed as a tigress in a cage; not but that there was, at times, a lighting up of her eyes, as though the tigress would like to make a spring. And, in the mean time, where was Eva? Precisely the question which Mr. Walmer asked when, on going to the house near the avenue, with an officer and a search-warrant, he found that the bird had flown. His lawyer asked the same question, in a portentous letter, well-flavored with threats of a suit for abduction, and so forth, to which I replied by a polite note, in which I blandly assured him that I knew nothing of the matter, but, at the same time, I advised him to go ahead, if he thought proper; and then his son, a huge youth of twenty-five, with knock-knees and goggle eyes, came to see me at my city mansion, and demanded satisfaction. “Satisfaction for what?” I asked. “For abducting my father's wife,” said he. “Who will, allow me to ask, inherit your father's estate?” “I will, of course—sole heir,” was the prompt reply. “But will you be sole heir, in case your parent is blessed with children by a second wife?” The young man had never thought of that before; called me a good fellow, shook my hand, and went his way; and I saw no more of him. But where was Eva? For months, Mr. Walmer surrounded me with spies, tracked my footsteps every where, (so he thought,) and discovered—nothing. “Where have you got her?” said that venerable man of the world, my father, with a wink and a chuckle. “Didn't think that a young fellow, just from college, knew so much of the world. Where have you got her?” To which I replied, in the most innocent manner, yet with dignity, “Pardon me, Mr. Warner, but really, I do not know to whom you refer.” Whereat the gay old man made mouths and incredulous faces. And where was Eva? CHAPTER XVI. In a garden, near the Hudson River, stands a very pretty frame-house, two stories high, with four rooms on a floor. Around the house is a grove of grand old trees, whose branches (it is early spring) mingle over the roof, and behind it is an abrupt cliff, backed by a thick wood. A more pretty or retired place cannot be imagined. Not ten miles from New-York, difficult of access by land, (for only a narrow footpath leading through the wood, connects it with the main road,) and located on the borders of the glorious Hudson, in sight of the magnificent Palisades, this cottage seems the very place for a quiet student, who wishes to avoid the world. And now, in spring time, when the leaves are budding, and the peach-tree in the garden is clad in blossoms, rich as a marriage vestment, and the gray old rocks begin to hide their grim faces behind flowering vines, why, certainly, the cottage looks very much like a stray piece of Eden. It is, indeed, the very place for a quiet student who wishes to avoid the world,— and, in fact, it is the resort or retreat of a quiet student, who, dressed in black (single-breasted frock coat), and looking very much like a young Jesuit, comes here, sometimes by day, but oftener by night. Strange to say, he does not often approach the cottage by the narrow path leading through the wood to the high road, but comes across the river in an oar-boat from the Jersey shore, as though he very much desired to avoid the observation of an inquisitive world. It is an evening in spring; the sun has set; the moon is up in the cloudless sky, looking at her face in the mirror of the broad Hudson; the air is full of the breath of blossoms. The sound of oars is heard, and then the boat, bearing the solitary student, comes near the shore; you can see his form, clad in sombre black, and a glimpse of his face, by the light of the moon. Arrived at the shore, he lands, fastens the boat, and passes through the garden toward the cottage, his gaze all the while fixed upon an upper room, from which a light is shining. At the door he pauses, and listens—and the door is presently opened by—a pretty girl? No. But by a hard featured, strong-limbed Irish servant-woman, who takes charge of the cottage in the student's absence, and thinks the world of him, for he has been kind to her, and given her money to pay the passage of her two children from Ireland to the New World. “Well, Peggy!” says the student. “And is it you, masther dear?” replies Peggy, handing him a silver candlestick, which contains a lighted wax candle. The student takes the candle, and softly goes up stairs, and enters the upper chamber on the right, facing the river. A neat room altogether—the walls white as snow—the floor covered with white matting—shelves filled with books in one corner, and a white curtain over the window looking to the river. A picture of the Virgin Mary smiles from the wall, over the table covered with books and papers. The student places his candle on the table, sinks into an armchair, and resting his elbow on the arm of the chair, and his cheek in his hand, falls into a reverie—his eyes grow fixed and dreamy. The Jesuit coat falls open, and you discover traces of gayer attire underneath—a blue coat, white vest, faultless shirt-bosom, and a diamond pin. So! He is not a young Jesuit after all? As he sits there, you would not think his face altogether unhandsome, with its clear complexion, dark hair and brows, aquiline features, and eyes of deep brown—eyes now brimful of happiness. And so he sits there, in a waking dream, and does not hear the opening of the door which leads into the next room, and does not see the white form on the threshold,—does not, indeed, awake from his reverie, until the white form is bending over him, and the pressure of pure young lips is upon his cheek. Then he starts, looks up, and beholds that young face, warm, voluptuous, and yet holy in its loveliness, as it looks down upon him and breathes upon his face. “Eva!” “Frank!” And the young girl is cradled on his knee, her head laid upon his breast, and his hand upon the rich masses of her auburn hair. And thus all alone with each other, shut out from the world, living only in the joy of each other's presence, the student and the young girl are happy in the upper room of the cottage by the Hudson shore. Let the veil be lifted gently from these pure and happy days! Thus Eva and I were happy together in the cottage by the Hudson shore, while spring and summer passed away; happy in the heaven of our own creation. Summer passed; the peach-tree in the garden was heavy with fruit; autumn came, and no change had come over our love. “Do not be long away, dear Frank,” she said to me one fall morning as she clung to my neck. “You know”—she stopped and blushed, not with shame, but from the very fulness of happiness. “You know, I might die in your absence.” She was about to become a mother, and a causeless indefinable presentiment of sudden death hung over her. I did my best to chase away the gloomy feeling, bade her good-bye, and promised to return before night. As I crossed the Hudson river in my boat, she waved her 'kerchief from the upper window—I can see her now! Arrived on the Jersey shore, I ascended the Palisades by a winding road, found my horse at a lonely farm-house, where I had been in the habit of leaving him; and mounting, rode to Hoboken and crossed to New-York. This I had done all spring and summer, to prevent my footsteps from being tracked. At my large city mansion I met my madam—my rich wife. “Will you not go with me, dearest Frank, to Mrs. Belblab's party to-night?” said she, with great cordiality. I respectfully excused myself. “Have another engagement, my dear,” said I, “an engagement which I can't put off.” From my mansion I hastened to the office of a celebrated doctor, and secured his services for the anticipated event. I gave him minute directions as to the locality of the cottage, and he promised to go out there in the afternoon and spend the night with us. To the doctor, in my half-Jesuit disguise, I represented myself as Mr. Morton, a student of divinity. About an hour after I had left the doctor's office, and when I had changed my attire for something more fashionable than the single-breasted coat of an ecclesiastic. I met that good man, my father, in Broadway. “Where do you keep her?” said he, shutting one eye and poking me in the ribs. “Now, there's no use in denying it. I know you've got her somewhere, but the question is, where?” It was night, when, crossing the Hudson after, I sprang upon the shore, and with a beating heart approached the cottage door. The night was dark and gloomy, the moon obscured by masses of leaden clouds. All was silent within and around the cottage. No light, this time, shone from an upper window, nor did the rough-featured Irish servant appear at the door to greet me with her ready welcome. Is it a wonder that all this filled me with a gloomy presentiment? Trembling in every nerve, I opened the door. I hurried along the dark entry, and up the dark stairway. At the door of Eva's chamber I hesitated, with my hand upon the latch, afraid to enter, and find my dark presentiment realized. At last I opened the door and entered. A taper placed in the fireplace gave but a faint light to the room barely disclosing the outlines of the bed, with its white coverlet, glimmering dimly in the mirror, and flinging uncouth shadows over the floor. All was still—silent as the grave. Agitated beyond measure, I went on tiptoe over the carpet to the bed, where, by the folds of the coverlet, I could faintly distinguish the outlines of a human form—“Eva is dead!” I gasped. A shadow rose from a chair beside the bed—in the dim light I could distinguish the slender frame and kindly looks of the good doctor. “Hush!” he whispered, and pressed my hand. “Look there!” He pointed to the face upon the pillow—the face of Eva, rosy with sleep, while her dark hair escaped in rich masses from beneath her white cap. Not dead, but sleeping. I could have shouted for joy. “Come here,” said the doctor, and led me to the fireplace, where, in the shadows, I distinguished Peggy, sitting in a chair, and holding something in her arms. “Shure, Maisther, and it's a boy!” said Peggy, with a smile upon her face. I could have hugged the stout servant in my joy “You are a father, and your wife is doing well,” said the doctor, “but she must, for a while, be kept quiet, away from the light and from all noise. I will remain here until the nurse whom I have engaged arrives. I expect her every moment. I thanked the good doctor, by a hearty pressure of the hand, and then took my place silently near the head of the bed, watching the beautiful countenance of my sleeping wife—my real wife—and listening to her even and gentle respiration. In about an hour, she stirred in her sleep and unclosed her eyes, and gently spoke my name. Oh, the pure rapture of that moment, when, pressing my kiss upon her forehead, I called her my dear, my only wife, and she replied, her eyes swimming in joy and tears, “You will love me always, will you not, dear husband?” In a little while the nurse arrived. As she entered the faintly-lighted room, she seemed to me like an immense bonnet and cap, to which was incidentally appended the figure of a woman. The doctor gave her some instructions in a low voice, and then said to me: “You will not need me again to-night. The nurse here will take all proper care of your wife; and, as for yourself, you had better retire to rest, as your presence may agitate our patient, and deprive her of needful repose.” He departed, after having reiterated his instructions to the nurse, who had divested herself of her bonnet, and now appeared in a cap, whose dimensions were supernatural. “Good-night, Eva,” I whispered, kissing the rosy cheek of the young mother. “Don't you see, dearest, that all our presentiments have proved false?” Then, leaving her to the care of Peggy and of the nurse with the phantom cap, I went, not to bed, but into the next room, in which the face of the Virgin Mary smiled from the wall. Seating myself in the arm-chair, in the dark, I gave myself up to the silent enjoyment of my happiness. I forget the world—forgot how wicked and base I had been in marrying the rich West Indian woman for her money. “Eva is my true wife! Eva is a mother!” was the thought which filled my soul. And thus I sat, silent and happy, while the night wore on, and the moonlight, broken by flitting clouds, came fitfully through the window curtains. “I will leave this rich wife of mine— leave her and her gold,” was my thought, “and, with Eva and our child, seek a home, however lowly, in the distant West.” And, thus musing, I fell asleep in the chair. From that sleep I was startled by a frightful dream—a dream whose details I couldn't remember, but which still left upon me an impression of incredible horror. It seemed to me that it was accompanied by a low, gurgling cry, like the last sound uttered by a drowning man. I started up and found that the morning had dawned. Its first rays were stealing through the window-curtains. Anxious to erase the impression of the dream from my mind, I gently entered Eva's chamber. The rays of the morning shone into it brightly, and from the east. Peggy was near the fireplace, asleep in her chair, the babe upon her knees. I approached the bed, upon which the first light of morning softly shone. Here I would willingly drop the pen, but the story must be told. CHAPTER XVII. The head of Eva was thrown back upon the pillow, her throat and shoulders were bare, her face was distorted by agony, her lips apart, and her eyes glassy. And upon her white throat there were livid marks, like the print of fingers. She was dead; her cheek was scarcely cold—but she was dead. She had been choked to death. The spasm of her last agony was still upon her face. It was her cry—that low gurgling sound—which I had heard in my dream. Maddened by that sight—the young mother dead upon her pillow—I still had presence of mind to pass to the fireplace and awake the servant from her slumber. As she opened her eyes and looked around with a sleepy stare, a new horror confronted me. The babe upon her knee was dead —the livid print of fingers was on its throat. “The nurse,” I gasped, “where is she? Woman! my wife and child have been murdered, and yet you sleep.” I did not wait for further words, but hurried from the room, and through every room in the house, in search of the nurse. She was no where to be found. Then sick at heart, I staggered into the open air, and examined the garden. The wicket-gate of the path leading to the wood was open, and upon the soft earth I traced the print of a footstep—the mark of a woman's shoe, turned from the house. While I stood gazing upon this footstep, a hand was laid upon my shoulder. Looking up, I beheld the slender frame and benevolent visage of the doctor. “I have come out thus early to rectify a queer mistake, which, somehow or other, was made last night. Yesterday, I succeeded in getting a nurse for your wife—a Mrs. Moulton, recommended to me by a brother physician. When I left my office yesterday afternoon, I told my student to send this Mrs. Moulton out here, as soon as she called. The nurse came, as you know, while I was here last night; and I took her, of course, to be Mrs. Moulton, whom, personally, I had never seen. Judge of my surprise, when, on returning to my office, last night, I found the real Mrs. Moulton waiting for me there. It appears the one who first called at the office, and whom my student sent to this place, was a sham Mrs. Moulton. And I have come out at this early hour to clear up this mystery. For I don't like a patient of mine to be entrusted to the care of a person whose qualifications I do not fully know. Bless me, how pale you look!” I silently motioned him to follow me, and led him into the house, and up the stairs, and into Eva's chamber. “There, doctor,” said I, pointing to the corpse of poor Eva, “behold the consequences of your mistake.” And as he sank back, perfectly appalled, I fell groaning and raving upon the form of my dead wife. It was at least three hours before I could recover sufficient fortitude to converse, even with the appearance of calmness, with the doctor. We came to the same conclusion. Eva had been murdered by the nurse, who, taking the name of Mrs. Moulton, had obtained admittance in the chamber of my real wife. “And now, doctor,” said I, with a husky voice and livid face, “as this has been the consequence, in some measure, of your negligence, I demand of you that there shall be no coroner's inquest. Make out what certificate you please of the causes of Eva's death, but let her be buried quietly and in peace. We must avoid all publicity. The doctor was troubled; he had never done such a thing; but I was imperative. “By pursuing such a course we will be enabled to discover the murderess,” said I, “and when she is discovered, you may make the matter public.” At length the doctor consented; and with a face stamped with grief and horror, and a leaden step, left the house, promising to return on the morrow. “Peggy, you have heard what I said to the doctor;” I said to the rough-featured Irish woman, who wept incessantly. “Do you, also, promise to be silent, in order that I may discover the murderess of your mistress?” The good woman, half choked as she was by grief, swore it on the cross. “And now,” said I, turning to the bed where Eva lay, her limbs composed, the death spasm gone from her face, and her dead babe in her arms—“Good-bye! thou dearest and truest of all the creatures of God. Good-bye! mother and child. You both have left me. With you, all that is good within me is dead. And if I live, it is not to enjoy life, or to love again, but it is —.” I could say no more, but bowed my head over the face of my dead wife, and wept my tears upon her face. And the poor Irish woman knelt by the bed, and in her rough voice spoke out a prayer of her church, for the souls of the mother and child. When I again raised my head, my attention was attracted by something bright which glittered on the pillow—it was a diamond ring, not mine, nor Eva's, but had evidently fallen from the hand of the murderess. I regarded it for a long time, and then secured it in my pocket-book. “Watch by the dead, to-night,” I said to the Irish woman, “early to-morrow I will return.” Then, dressing myself in fashionable attire, I left the cottage, passed through the wood, and gained the high road. It was a cloudy autumnal day; the sky leaden; the wind howling mournfully, and whirling the withered leaves high in air. As I walked rapidly along the high road to the city, you may be sure that all the agony a man can feel, and yet live, was tearing at my heart-strings. Had it not been for the hope of vengeance, I verily believe I would have gone mad. Night had fallen, when, entering the city, I directed my steps to my lofty mansion. As I ascended the steps, and traversed the lofty hall, how different were my feelings from yesterday. “The madam is out!” one of the servants informed me: “Out in the carriage on Broadway.” I hurried to the library, and on the way encountered the pretty quadroon girl, Marie. She had always regarded me with a singular mixture of fear and affection, since the morning of “the phial” scene. “Come here, Marie,” and I led her into the library, and lighted a candle. “Do you know this ring?” “Dat 'long to missus,” said the brown girl, looking at me with her big eyes. “Name inside.” Holding the ring to the light, I discovered that the initials of the madam, the initials of the name which she had borne in her first marriage, were indeed engraven on the inside. “I only asked, Marie, because I wish to present your mistress with a much handsomer ring. Now, go down stairs, and tell them to have supper ready by the time madam comes home.” The girl left the library, and I sat down to— think. A servant soon came to announce that the madam had returned, and that supper was waiting for us. I looked in the glass, and arranged my attire. I was startled by the ghastly pallor of my face. “This will not do; the part which I have to play demands a face all gaiety and smiles.” I drew a decanter from the closet, and drank a half tumbler of Madeira, and felt it flush my face in an instant, although it did not produce the least sensation of intoxication. Descending to the supper room, I found an elegant repast in waiting by the light of wax candles; and the madam was there, richly dressed, her wig as black, her false teeth as white, as usual. Her little black eyes, it seemed to me, shone with feverish lustre, and her cheeks were spread with an additional thickness of rouge. She greeted me warmly, and I her with ease and gaiety. And we sat down to supper. How we talked! Of the opera, the last party, the newest scandal—who was to marry such a belle, and who such an exquisite would honor with his hand—how we talked! Of anything and everything save the subject which was deepest in both our hearts. And all the while, behind my richly-dressed, bejewelled madam, I saw the vision of a young mother, dead upon her bed, with her dead baby on her breast. After supper came wine; and we drank each other's health, and talked and laughed, until Maria, who waited by the table, watching us with her big eyes, could not help joining loudly in our merriment. At length, in perfect good humor with herself, the madam retired to ber chamber, and I went into the library. There I sat for a long time in silent thought. It was after midnight, when, candle in hand, I stole softly into the luxurious chamber of the madam. Locking the door, I drew a small table to the bedside, and placed upon its dark surface three objects—the lighted candle, a glass filled with Madeira, and the ring. I surveyed the madam as she slept, under her silver canopy. She was wrapped in a night robe, fringed with lace; a cap had taken the place of her wig, her false teeth lay upon the bureau. A more luxuriously attired or uglier woman I had never seen. I laid my hand upon her shoulder: “Get up, madam,” I said in her ear. She started up, opened her eyes in sleepy wonder, as she clutched her night robe over her shoulders. “Frank! what's the matter?” she cried, her voice (from the absence of her teeth) hardly intelligible. And the sleepy wonder on her face began to be succeeded by a look of vague terror. “The matter is, madam, that to-morrow morning I will consign you to the hands of justice, as the murderess of my real and only wife. And I have come to inform you of it, so that you may prepare yourself to be dragged through the streets, like the felon that you are, with the mob hooting at your heels. O madam! do you know this ring?” Never shall I forget the dead, blank look, which, at my words, came over her face. She clutched her hands nervously, but had not a word in reply. “This ring I found on Eva's pillow, dearest,” I continued. “And you can now prepare yourself for the morrow! I did not think of offering you a glass of wine, or of soothing you with a few drops from the silver phial, but—” I tossed the contents of the wineglass upon the carpet, and regarded her with a look which she understood,—“but I believe you are in the habit of stilling your nerves with morphine. Try some morphine to-night, love. It will make you sleep well.” And taking up the ring, I rose as if to leave the room. Then, clad in her nightclothes, she sprang from the bed, and clutched me by the knees, offering me her fortune, everything, if I would only spare her life. “I don't threaten your life, madam,” I replied, shaking her grasp from my knees, “I only speak of to-morrow, and advice morphine.” And taking up the ring, I left the room. But at the very door she again fell at my feet, clutched my knees, and held me back. “Take my fortune, take all,” she shrieked, “only spare my life. Spare my life! my life!” Her night-dress fell from her shoulders, and her own hair— black streaked with gray—streamed down her livid cheeks. Never have I seen so terrible a picture of fright. I was touched,—I relented,—but a power over which I had no control suddenly possessed me. “Woman! I do not take your life. I do not condemn you. It is your first and your second husband; it is Eva and her child who condemn you. Address your prayers to them, not to me.” And again I flung her from me. I left the room and closed the door; and watched without in the dark. I heard her pace up and down, heard her sobs and groans, and ejaculations; and thus, perchance, two hours passed away. At length all was still within her chamber. Not a sound broke the dead quiet. I went slowly to the library room, and sat before the fire, in a sort of half stupor, awaiting the approach of dawn. Dawn came at last, and there was a loud outcry and the sound of footsteps hurrying to and fro throughout the mansion Marie rushed into the library and flung herself at my feet. “O Master! O Master!” was all she could say— “Come! Come!” And clutching me by the hands, she led me from the room and down stairs, into the bed-chamber of her mistress. The morning light shone gaily through the embroidered curtains, and a bird in a cage near the window was gaily singing, and—a corpse was suspended from the canopy by a silken cord, the blackened face and startling eyeballs turned full to the light. CHAPTER XVIII. The madam had preferred the rope to morphine, and she was dead. The second day from this event there were two funerals in New-York. The one, a gorgeous affair, went with a long procession of carriages to Greenwood; myself chief mourner. It was in the afternoon that I stood in front of the vault, surrounded by the crowd of funeral guests, and hid my face in my handkerchief, as the parson read the service, and the coffin, with the huge silver plate glittering in the sunshine, was slowly lowered out of sight. The madam had “committed suicide in a fit of temporary insanity,”—such was the verdict of the coroner's jury; so said the papers; and the parson, alluding to the fact, dwelt long and touchingly upon the holy life and pure conscience of the deceased. At this everybody observed me shake with emotion as I covered my face with the handkerchief. The other funeral took place at night, or in the dusk of the evening. The Irish servant woman, the good doctor, and myself, were the only persons who stood around the lonely grave, by the Hudson River, in the still twilight. We buried Eva—and her child beside her mother. And as the coffin, containing the young mother and her child, sank slowly out of sight, the Irish woman and the doctor wept like children. As for myself, I could not weep. Gazing round the lonely graveyard, and upon the Hudson, rippling gently in the twilight, and upon the western sky, mellow and golden with the last kiss of day, I remembered,—O how vividly!—the last time that Eva and I had stood side by side in this place. “Do you think,” whispered the doc tor, “that the murderess of this poor child will ever be discovered?” “Doctor!” I answered, “the murderess has already gone to her account. She was buried in Greenwood to-day.” Returning to my mansion in the city, I found my good father waiting for me in the library, dressed and perfumed as usual. “Quite an afflicting dispensation, Frank,” he said, trying his best to look grave. “How hard you took it in Greenwood to-day! Everybody remarked it! And now I suppose you are a disconsolate widower, worth some half a million dollars! And,”—he glanced around the room and lowered his voice,—“And she didn't make your coffee too strong for you, after all, did she, boy?” Good old man. The history of the next few months may be written in a few words. I spent a great part of the time at the cottage, musing, like one in a waking dream, upon the irrevocable past. For hours without changing my position, I would sit silently gazing upon the bed in which Eva had slept, upon the dress which she had worn, upon the books which she had read, upon her vacant chair. I was sitting one morning, late in winter, in the library-room of my great town mansion—my feet upon the fender—my hands folded on my knees, my eyes fixed vaguely on the fire—when the servant entered and announced that a Mr. Stebbins wished to see me. “Show him up,” said I, and wondered who the deuce was Mr. Stebbins, and what he wanted with me? “Can it be another lawyer from Walmer, or any thing about my West India wife?” Mr. Stebbins entered—a spare little man, with sharp features, thin gray whiskers, and gold spectacles. He dropped into a chair, holding his hat in both hands, as though it had been a dish. “I am,” said he, without further preface, “I am one of the tellers of such and such a bank.” It was a bank in which I had deposited a large amount of money. “Well, Mr. Stebbins, I am glad to see you. I have not overdrawn my account, I hope?” Mr. Stebbins gave a kind of wintry smile. “O no! sir. By no means, sir,” and he drew from his overcoat a large pocket-book. “Be so kind as to look at 4 that.” He placed a check in my hands. It was a check for a hundred dollars, signed by my name, the signature so well done, that I hesitated ere I could satisfy myself that it was a forgery. “Allow me to ask, Mr. Warner, is that your signature?” “And allow me to ask by whom was this check presented, and have you paid the money on it?” “We have paid the money on it, and it was presented this morning by a middle-sized, elderly man, in green spectacles and long gray hair. We paid the money, and the man left the bank, and it was not until then, that some informality in the manner in which the check is drawn, caused us to doubt its genuineness. Is that your signature, sir?” For a moment I was buried in thought. It was not my signature—but I did not feel inclined to let loose the hounds of law at once upon the unknown poor devil who had forged my name. So I replied—“Really, Mr. Stebbins, I cannot at once decide. You perceive the check is not from my check-book—it is written, not printed. This is suspicious; but I may at some time have given this check, while absent from home. It is dated some weeks back.” And I desired Mr. Stebbins to call at five o'clock in the evening, when I hoped to be able to speak definitely on the matter. With that white-heat malignity in his eyes which the mere mention of a forgery always calls up to the eyes of an officer of a bank, Mr. Stebbins sat his hat square upon his head and departed. And I took my hat and cloak, and strolled out upon Broadway, in order to keep an appointment with a young artist of fine genius, who was painting my portrait. This artist, whom I will call Carlton—Louis Carlton—interested me deeply. Scarcely twenty-four, with long hair, eyes full of fire, and a Raphael-like face, he had already displayed proofs of the highest genius. Some of his portraits were worthy of the first artist in the country; and he was engaged upon an historical picture, which was stamped with extraordinary invention and power. Louis had made me his confidant. He was poor—was in love with an orphan girl, whom he described as possessing the rarest beauty. It was his ambition to visit Italy, study there for a year or two and then return home to marry, and to achieve fame and fortune. And, occupied as I was by the inevitable past of my own life, I could not help feeling interested in the future of the young artist. In a few minutes after I left my own house, I found myself in the studio of the young artist—a small room, lighted by a window which opened to the west, and crowded with the evidences of his craft. The sun shone brightly upon an unfinished portrait on the easel, but the place was deserted. Louis was not there. Flinging myself upon the sofa, I soon found my attention chained by a picture which stood upon the wall—was it a portrait, or a fancy sketch? The face of a young girl, with sunny complexion, deep blue eyes, masses of golden hair, and a neck and half-revealed bosom worthy of Eve—was it a portrait or a fancy sketch? I was asking this question, when my ear was arrested by the sound of voices in an adjoining room, separated from the studio by a door which was slightly opened; the sound of voices—a man's voice and a woman's mingling in earnest conversation. And my own name pronounced more than once, in tones tremulous with emotion, struck my ear. I rose, crept near the slightly opened door, and concealed myself in a corner, behind a faded screen. Thus placed, I could distinctly hear the conversation in the next room. “Oh! Louis, Louis! how could you do it!” It was a woman's voice, earnest and full of agony, yet very musical, which spoke these words. “I know not, Eveline, I know not!” returned the voice of Louis. “I must have been mad! Here I was, with all my labor, over head and ears in debt— my things seized by the landlord—every prospect closed against me; and, added to this, the thought of you toiling like a slave at your needle, for bare bread—and —and—I must have been mad! To forge a check; to put to it the name of one who has been my best friend; to disguise myself and present it at the bank; to write felon on my forehead, and expose myself to a convict's doom! Oh! Eveline! Eveline! I must have been mad!” His voice grew husky with agony. I could hear him sob, and could also hear the low voice of Eveline comforting him. “Louis, you were mad. You couldn't have been yourself. But all may yet be well.” “Well!” he echoed, in frantic tones, “am I not a villain? Am I not certain to be discovered and put to shame? No, Eveline, no! All will not be well! My life is blasted forever!” “But, Louis!” I heard her low and gentle voice, “why not see Mr. Warner himself, and state the case to him, and throw yourself upon his generosity? When his portrait is finished he will owe you at least a hundred dollars.” “There it is! there it is!” broke in the voice of the artist, “I was too proud to ask him to advance me the money, but not too proud to forge his name.” And again his voice died away in sobs. “But, go to him, Louis; go to him at at once, and all may yet be well!” Presently, I heard his footstep, and saw him from my hiding-place, as he came from the front room into the studio. He was deathly pale, and his eyes were red with weeping. “Wait, Eveline, wait until I return.” He pulled his cap low over his brows, and, rushing by the screen which concealed me, left the room. Gliding gently from my hiding-place, I went into the front room. Eveline was seated upon the sofa, weeping. In her face I at once saw the original of the portrait. She was above the medium height, and her form, nobly and richly moulded, was clad to the throat in a plain black dress, which contrasted strongly with her clear complexion and golden hair. If her glowing cheek and expansive bust showed a voluptuous organization, her lip indicated pride, and her forehead intellect. She rose, blushing, and yet with a stately air, as I entered. “Mr. Warner!” she ejaculated. She knew me by the half-finished portrait in the studio. “The same, miss,” I replied. Allow me the honor of a few minutes, conversation. To make matters brief, I will at once inform you that I overheard all that passed between Louis and you a few moments ago.” “And you will save him!” she cried, with great flashing eyes and a glowing cheek. As I gazed upon this beautiful creature, a feeling of cynicism altogether infernal possessed me. Perchance, the events of the last two or three months had warped my nature. At all events, as I saw the lovely girl blushing and tearful before me, I felt impelled to make her suffer all that was in my power to inflict. “Miss Eveline, the fate of Louis is in your hands.” “In my hands?” “It rests with you to decide whether, to-night, freed from the charge of forgery, and with ample means to defray his expenses, he shall be on his way to Italy, or whether he shall, to-night, sleep in the Tombs.” “It rests with me!” she slowly said, dropping her eyes. “With you!” and I whispered a few words, which brought burning blushes to her cheeks. “O shame! O shame! You cannot mean this; you are too generous—you—” “I am not generous. I am rich. I hold Louis in my power. You are exceedingly beautiful. You can save him. Will you? To-night, Louis will be on his way to Italy, and you will be — “I whispered the rest in her ear. “Or, if you decline to save him, Louis, to-night, will sleep in the Tombs.” She gave me a look. If looks could kill, that one would have struck me like lightning. CHAPTER XIX. And then again shame and anger filled her bosom, her cheeks and eyes. “Decide! the footstep of Louis is on the stairs! in a moment it will be too late! Quick, Miss Eveline, Italy or the Tombs!” What a look she gave me, as, half rising, with a face pale as death, she gasped “Italy!” and then sank back fainting upon the sofa. And the next instant Louis entered. He saw me, and without a word sank on a chair, and covered his face with his hands. “Not a word, Louis! I know all, and will save you!” “O sir—” “No time is to be lost; not a moment. This afternoon at five I am to decide whether that check is genuine or a forgery; and at four the steamer sails for Liverpool. You must be on board of that steamer, prepared for your journey to Italy. I will not only save you from the consequences of the forgery, but will advance you means to support you for two years abroad.” O generous man! How can I ever repay you!” “Not a word, but pack up, pack up! and in your absence I will be as a guardian to your bride—that is, your betrothed.” At this moment Eveline revived from her fainting fit and heard my closing words. “All is arranged,” I cried, turning to her; “Louis consents! Italy is the word!” Again that look! But I remained with her and Louis until his trunks were packed, the needful money in his pocket, and everything ready for his departure. They had not a chance to exchange a word alone. It was three o'clock; the carriage which was to bear him to the steamer waited below; the moment of farewell had arrived. Louis flung himself into her arms: “Be true, Eveline—be true to me till death,” he cried. She echoed his words—“True to you till death!” and looked over his shoulder into my face with that peculiar look. I stood with folded arms surveying the scene. “To your care, patron and benefactor! do I commit her,” cried Louis. There was another frantic embrace; and, tearing her arms from his neck, he hurried from the room. From the window I saw him enter the carriage, and saw the carriage drive away. He was gone. I was alone with the proud and beautiful Eveline, who sat on the sofa, now blushing, and now pale as death. “Now, my dear ward!” said I, bringing her bonnet and cloak, “you will go home with your guardian.” She did not say a word, but put on her bonnet and cloak, and took my arm. I felt her arm tremble, as we left the studio, descended the stairs, and pursued our way along Broadway. She dropped her veil over her face; I could not trace the emotions there, but I felt her shudder at every step. At length we reached my house. “I have sent to your boarding-house for your things. This house, in future, shall be your home.” We entered the mansion; I called the brown girl Marie: “This lady, Marie, is your future mistress,” I said; and then, turning to Eveline, who, veiled and shuddering, stood in the centre of the large and gloomy parlor, I whispered,—“Do you still adhere to your promise, without equivocation or thought of escape?” “I do,” was the answer in a broken voice. “Marie, conduct Miss Eveline to her room. At five, miss, I will be pleased to see you in this parlor, as the man with the check will call at that time.” Eveline went slowly from the parlor; and I was alone. What strange thoughts possessed me! Here was a noble and beautiful girl, willing to sacrifice herself to save her lover from a felon's cell. “Wealth is power,” I said, and laughed to myself; and I employed the next hour in sending certain of my servants, in various directions, upon business of some moment connected with my plans. Five o'clock came, and with it Mr. Stebbins, whose thin face glowed with positive delight as he seated himself in a chair near the table, upon which stood a wax candle, and at once unrolled the portentous pocket-book. “Ah! on the track of the villain—on the track of the villain! To-morrow we'll have him, sure,—eh?” He stopped abruptly, as, for the first time, he perceived Eveline, who was seated upon the sofa in the shadows of the parlor. “This young lady is my ward, Mr. Stebbins. You can speak freely in her presence. And, as he ran glibly on, I, leaning against the mantel, could mark the agitation of Eveline, which every moment threatened to break forth in words. “And so you are on the track of the villain, are you?” “On his track, on his track! You see we've discovered the store at which he bought the wig which he wore. He is described as a young, genteel man; and one of the notes—a ?20 bill—which he received for the check, has been traced to the hands of the person to whom he paid it away. To-morrow, Mr. Warner—” Here Eveline bent forward, clasped her hands, and uttered a low groan; she evidently suffered deeply. “To-morrow, Mr. Stebbins, you will say nothing of this affair,” thus I interrupted him. “The check was mine. You will pass it to my account. As to this story of the wig, that may or may not be true; but the simple fact is this, the check was genuine. I applaud your vigilance, Mr. Stebbins, but this time you have been grossly deceived. Good-evening, Mr. Stebbins.” These words struck Mr. Stebbins with amazement. It was after a moment of dumb surprise, that he rolled up the pocket-book, bade me good-evening, and departed. I was alone with Eveline. I drew near to her: “Louis is safe and on his way to Italy!” I whispered, regarding her earnestly; she met my gaze, and trembled from head to foot. And yet, despite her pallor and her agitation, she was proudly beautiful. “Have you no word of thanks?” I resumed, after a moment's pause. She raised her eyes; they were filled with tears. “Oh! have you no mercy?” she cried, and slid from the sofa on her knees, and bowed her head upon her heaving bosom. “Is this your gratitude? is this your fulfilment of your promise?” I cried indignantly; “I saved your lover from a felon's cell upon one condition; and now you wish to evade that condition. You promised to be mine, and—without marriage. I hold you to the fulfilment of your promise.” “O sir, I have loved Louis, loved him for years; alone in the world, we were all in all to each other. All his plans for the future were linked with my happiness; the very crime which he committed was done for my sake. And now, that you have so generously rescued him from ruin,—can you, Oh! can you, sink his betrothed wife to eternal infamy?” “Once for all, Eveline, let me tell you that such talk is vain.” I raised her from the floor. “Awake from your world of romance into the real, practical world—a world in which everything has its price, and in which nothing is given away. You speak of my generosity. And how came it in my power to be generous? Do you know, woman? By selling myself, in a manner, a thousand fold more infamous than that in which you are about to sacrifice yourself to serve your lover.” I must have looked like a devil, while uttering these words, for she shrank away from my gaze, covering her face with her hands. “Come, Eveline—” I took her by the hand and led her from the room and up the stairs into a richly furnished chamber, where a single light was burning before a mirror. That mirror reflected our faces—mine, flushed with mad excitement—hers, framed in its golden hair, crimson and snow by turns, and startlingly beautiful. She clung to my wrist with both hands, and, for the last time, regarded me with a look of overwhelming entreaty. “Mercy!” she whispered. I pointed to a door which opened into an adjoining chamber! “Our bridal room, my love!” and led her toward the door. Her eyes roved wildly round the room. An object on the table in front of the mirror caught her gaze; she seized it and raised it glittering in the air. It was a poignard which I had left upon the table by chance or by design. “I will keep my promise,” she said, in a low voice, but with a deathly resolution in her eyes. “I will sacrifice myself to you, but you shall not possess me living;” and she placed the point of the dagger to her bosom. CHAPTER XX. It was a critical moment. I made no reply, but, stepping backward, light in hand, opened the door which led into the next room. At the same moment I extinguished the light. Eveline, from where she stood, could see clearly into the next chamber, which was brilliantly lighted. She looked. The dagger dropped upon the floor, and she came forward and took me gently by the hand. And I led her into the next room, where two persons were waiting by a table, upon which was placed an open Bible. One of these persons was dressed in a gown and surplice—a fat, robust, easy-looking gentleman; and the other was a young man, with a face like Raphael, and the eye of a poet. “Doctor,” I said to the clergyman, “I thank you for your punctuality,” and, bowing to the young man, “Louis, behold your bride!” And the artist and maiden joined hands. While the ceremony was said, his eyes turned deep with passion; her face looked wild and startled, as though she thought herself in a dream. The rubicund clergyman pronounced them man and wife. “Louis, after you left for the steamer to-day, I discovered that it would not sail until to-morrow. I therefore sent a servant to you, directing you to follow him to this room, where I could meet you. Well! we have met. Are you satisfied. And you, Madam Carlton, are you satisfied?” Louis was too full to speak; but, as for his young and beautiful wife, she dropped his hand, and came to me, and put her arms about my neck, and kissed me on the cheeks and forehead,— “God bless you, generous man!” and turned again to her husband weeping. There was a long pause, in which not a word was said. At length, I led the way into another room, where an elegant supper was spread. We all sat down; Louis and Eveline too happy to do justice to the repast, while I slowly drank my wine, and the portly clergyman ate and drank as though there was a wager in the case. And the good gentleman and I sat over our wine, long after the bride and bridegroom had retired to their chamber, and talked of everything—politics, Puseyism, “popery,” the authorship of Junius, whether Napoleon was a greater man than Cromwell, et cetera, et cetera. At last, being joyous with wine, the good man went home in my carriage, and I retired to the library, and—took a segar. “Frank, my boy!” I said, as I watched the smoke curling to the ceiling, “you have done one good deed in your life. A dev'lish odd way you took of doing it, but still it was a good deed.” And the next morning I saw the happy couple on board the steamer, Louis looking like a poet, and Eveline like an empress; and, having received the last adieu, returned to my home, wandered sadly up to the library, and felt myself the loneliest man in the world. Soon after this my father died; cause, too much terrapin, at an aldermanic repast, and I was alone in the world. Anxious to escape from my thoughts, I plunged into society. I bought me fast-trotting horses. I had my box at the opera. I put my name among those who got up big dinners to distinguished strangers, managed mock funerals at the death of great men, and patronized rich churches, art-unions, and the various societies for the promotion of humbug all over the world. I gave big dinners at my city palace. I lent money to needy fashionables. I gambled. In a word, I did everything that a man with half a million dollars can do, who is anxious to escape thinking. But it would not do. The ugly thought of my hag-wife, hanging by the silken cord, followed me everywhere; and poor Eva, with her dead baby on her breast, was always before my eyes. “What you might have been, Frank, if you had not sold yourself for money, or if your father had not sold Eva to the rich broker!” 'Twas an ugly thought; but I could not shake it off. And thus, one, two, three years wagged away. And while the years wagged on, spite of all my attempts to banish thought, a complete and all-overshadowing gloom took possession of me. The following words will but faintly give an idea of the state of my mind at this period: There is something terrible in that hour which brings to the heart a fullness of despair—an utter listlessness in all the affairs of life—a conviction that there is no use to struggle and suffer longer—a sense of the utter futility of any and all kinds of effort—a settled disposition to brood upon the past, to hope not in the future, and thus to wear the last elements of life away. Loud-voiced suffering there is in the world that relieves itself in wild utterance, in alternate spasms of hope and despair, and in tears. But there is a suffering which is hard to bear. Quiet in its action, always with you, crowding upon you unbidden when you try to rouse yourself to effort—coming to you in dreams, and in dreams that call back everything of the past, and print their images even upon your waking hours— this kind of suffering is hard to bear, and it wears, and wears the very life away. Oh! the bitter, bitter hour when, satisfied of the ingratitude and misapprehension of your fellow-beings—when, hopeless of he future, and certain only that you are utterly isolated and alone— alone—all, all alone—you throw down your arms and give up the game of life, as a game that has gone against you, and —irrevocably. Then your existence itself becomes a sort of perpetual dream; you wander about the places and the memories of the past, and all the while feel that the chords of life are snapping one by one within you. And the hours you spend alone with yourself no human hand can paint, no human heart can sympathize with. You feel that you are an incarnate isolation, an incarnate despair—something that the lightnings have not killed but blasted; you feel all the time the force of the ever-recurring question, “What business have I here in this weary, weary life?” And thus wear on the hours and days slowly, awfully, with leaden steps and memories that end all their lessons with an early death and a quiet grave. So broken down and wrecked by calamity upon calamity, you sometimes feel a kind of horrible joy in the thought that you have endured all that can be endured, and that another blow will break the last chord of endurance and of life. Oh! in this perpetual though quiet agony, now anything that reminds you of a happy home—the face, the voice of a pure woman, or a sinless child—how it merely increases your despair, and how you know that, though these have once been yours—these, all the sacred images of home—yet never can they be again! And you can creep away to your lonely room, and measure the depths of your loneliness by contrasting the present with the past. From thoughts like these; from the dead apathy of despair which came with them, I was aroused by a personage whose history became suddenly and strangely connected with my own. Eugenia! And who was Eugenia, and how came her life to mingle with my own? Let me tell the story. CHAPTER XXI. Let me tell how I first met Eugenia. One night I was sitting alone in one of the largest parlors of my grand city man sion. The servants had long ago retired, and the house was still as a tomb. A wax candle, which stood on the table before me, shed its light for a few paces around the table, but left the other parts of the room veiled in uncertain twilight. The huge mirrors glittered faintly in the light, and the pictures on the wall—scriptural subjects from the hands of old masters—appeared in vague, almost distorted outlines. It was a night in early spring, and a wood fire smoldered on the hearth. Seated in a chair by the table, my hands placed together, and my head sunken on my breast, I gazed vacantly and dreamily at the light, and was thinking. My life came up to me in a sort of grotesque and nightmare panorama. The wild life I had lately led; the scenes of mad dissipation through which I had passed, in my effort to kill time and banish thought; the images of the race-course, the ball-room, the opera, and the gambling hell; these were in the foreground of the picture which rose to my mind. And in the background was the sweet, holy face of Eva, and the livid, distorted face of my hag-wife. I found myself thinking aloud. “Frank, my boy! this will not do. You are getting old before your time. Your cheeks are sallow, and there is an ugly hollow underneath each eye. The owner of half a million dollars, you ought to be happy! And yet you are not happy. The excitement of the gambling-table does not please you. The music and the stir of the ball-room only bores you. Even fast-trotting horses have failed to charm. As to the opera, and the routine of fashionable society, they are just better than being in jail, and that is all. Frank, my boy! you must occupy yourself in something—in something, no matter what—or this delicate centre of nerves called the brain will begin to be affected. What shall that something be? Shall you dabble in literature, speculate in building lots, or—get married? Get married!” A miniature of Eva, placed near the candle met my eye. “No—I don't think we'll get married. Where is the woman who can fill the place of Eva?” As thus I sat alone, thinking aloud, the hours began to approach morning; and, whether from causes purely physical, or from long-continued mental excitement, a nameless horror imperceptibly overshadowed me. I started in my chair, as though I had suddenly awoke from a dream. Suddenly, I felt myself terribly alone; I was afraid; afraid of I knew not what. Shuddering and cold, I saw the face of my hag-wife, distorted by the throe of death, pass between me and the light—saw it visibly, palpably, and yet knew it to be nothing but a vision. And after this hideous face, there passed slowly between me and the candle the face of Eva, her eyes fixed upon me with an indescribable look of sadness and reproach. These faces passed and were gone, and came again. I rose slowly from my chair, and covered my eyes with my hands. The nameless horror paralyzed me from head to foot. There was a moment in which the agonies of ages seemed crowded into a focus—a moment in which the most awful fear that can afflict a living man—the fear of Insanity —took full possession of me. When I drew my hands away from my eyes, they were wet with the moisture which had suddenly bathed my forehead. And afraid to gaze upon the light, lest I should again behold those faces, I cast my eyes upon the mirror beyond it. Was this a new vision? In the mirror, behind my own face, near my shoulder, I beheld, distinctly drawn, another face—a face with its low forehead covered with thick shaggy black hair, and its small dark eyes glittering like points of flame. Was this also a vision like the others? As I asked myself the question, I saw a hand rise above my face in the mirror, and that hand grasped a pistol, knife, or club—some weapon whose form I could not precisely determine. Quick as lightning I turned—turned in time to receive a blow upon my left wrist, and the next instant had the intruder by the throat. There was a violent but brief struggle, in which the whole room seemed to whirl around me, and when I saw clearly, I found myself with one knee planted upon the chest of the intruder, and one hand fixed upon his throat. Panting for breath, even as he grasped in my clutch, I took a glance at the unknown. A young man, or boy of eighteen or nineteen years, about the middle height, with a lithe, sinewy form, clad in a gray overcoat, set with huge horn buttons; a swarthy face, with small nervous features, little fiery eyes, and a low forehead, rendered almost imperceptible by masses of black hair, thick and matted; such was the sight which met my gaze. “Well! you're pretty, whoever you are,” I said, as soon as I could draw breath. “Young for a jail-bird. But you look the character.” I took the pistol from his hand, and (without relaxing my grasp) placed it quietly on the chair behind me. “What have you to say for yourself? To what am I indebted for the honor of your company?” The youth replied with some difficulty, for my hand was at his throat: “Jest let me up; come now, you needn't strike a feller when he is down,” and some other words of a deprecatory character. With the aid of a kerchief which I took from the breast pocket of his overcoat, I secured the young man's arms by the wrists, and then, rising from his chest, told him to get up and help himself to a chair. He rose, shook himself, looked anxiously toward the door, and then dropped into a chair, his countenance manifesting much sullen ferocity. A more perfect realization of the abstract idea conveyed in the word “scamp” I never beheld. “Let us have a little private conversation. If you attempt to rise from your chair, I shall be forced to hurt you. Keep perfectly still, and let me know, first of all, who you are; and, secondly, what was your errand here.” “The youth replied in a pointed way: “As to my name, it don't make any difference—it don't. As to what I came here for, you know as well as I do;” he pointed with his pinioned hands to the side-board; “gold plate there, and money in the house, so I heard. That's what I come for.” “And how did you get in?” “False keys,” replied the young man, with refreshing brevity. “And did you intend to murder me, in order to get at my gold plate?” “Can't say as I did; only to make you a little sleepy, or something o' that sort.” There was an amount of frankness about the young man which was quite endearing. “Now, have not you a good opinion of yourself? A young gentleman of your fine personal appearance, calculated to adorn any walk of city life, to plan a midnight robbery and murder.” “Gas!” was the succinct reply of the youth. “Gas! What's the use of talkin'! I tried it, and you were too many for me. That's all.” And he sank his head doggedly on his breast, and refused to utter another word. In vain I plied him with questions; he sat as motionless as though he were a piece of the chair, or a part of the furniture of the room. I asked him as to his parentage, his condition in life, his motives for the commission of the robbery; but not a word could I wring from his lips. At last, I rose and secured his wrists by an additional kerchief, and then tied his ankles together. He made no resistance. “Remain here for a moment, my young friend!” said I, “and I will endeavor to procure you more entertaining company.” Still, he made no reply. I left the room and the house, and, in less than fifteen minutes, returned with a policeman—a stout individual, much enveloped in great coats, with a weatherbeaten face, a rich voice for crying oysters, and a very elaborate brass star. Entering the parlor, I found the young gentleman seated in the chair in the same attitude in which I had left him. “Take charge of this young person; I will appear and make complaint against him to-morrow.” The policeman stooped and united the ankles of the prisoner. “Young gallus, I guess we'll travel!” was his only remark, as he seized the youth by the shoulder. To which the youth replied by thrusting his tongue into one cheek, closing one eye in an indescribable manner, and repeating, emphatically the monosyllable, “Gas!” He was evidently a hopeless scamp. I saw them depart together, and bade the policeman good-night; after which I went up to the library room, and sat down to meditate upon the events of the night. One good thing had resulted from the unexpected visit of the hopeful youth; it had completely banished the waking vision which, in terrible distinctness, had passed between me and the candle. * * In due time, the young man was tried in the proper court, by the name, (evidently not his own,) of John Smith. He appeared to have neither relations nor friends in the wide world. The same demeanor which he had observed in my parlor he wore in court, making various faces—all of an uncouth and ungraceful character—while I gave my testimony— asking the foreman of the jury, as he announced the verdict of “guilty!” for a small portion of chewing tobacco, and interrupting the judge, in the midst of a moral lesson, with an inquiry by no means pertinent, whether he had ever ascertained the name of the individual who inflicted personal violence upon one William Patterson. In a word, he was a precocious and hopeless scamp, and did not seem to care half as much for the three years in the State Prison—inevitably before him— as a city alderman would for the loss of one hour's refreshment in the tea-room. I left him in court, his matted hair drawn low over his forehead, and his small eyes shining with more than usual lustre. He was to be sentenced at some future day. Returning home, I soon forgot all about the matter. John Smith, his matted hair and villanous eyes, his attempt at burglary and murder, and his three years in the State Prison, all faded from my memory, or were banished rather by the sad memories of my own life. One evening, I was seated in the parlor reading, or attempting to read, by the light of a single candle, when the servant entered and announced that a person wished to see me. “She will not give her name—” “It is a lady, then?” “Yes, sir—deeply veiled—can't say whether she is old or young—quite a mysterious person—desires to see you alone—laid quite an emphasis on the word alone!” My curiosity was somewhat excited. I directed the liveried servant to show the lady into the parlor; and, after he retired, awaited her appearance in great suspense. A few minutes elapsed, and the lady entered, and took a seat near me, without a word. “You wish to see me, madam! or—or—miss?” (I did not know which to say.) “My name is Van Warner.” The lady made no reply. She did not lift her veil from her face. I confess I felt considerably embarrassed. She was darkly clad, about the medium height, and the black shawl which fell aside from her shoulders disclosed a bust which could not belong to any one but a young and beautiful woman. Her gloved hands, one of which grasped her veil, were exquisitely small. In a word, although her dress wore the appearance of respectable poverty, and her face was closely veiled, I was impressed that the woman who sat before me was not more than eighteen, and exceedingly beautiful. Again I broke the dead stillness: “You wish to see me miss, or—or—madam?” For the first time she spoke. Oh! the rare music of her voice! And as she spoke she slowly lifted her veil. The impression made upon me by that face disclosed by the slowly lifted veil, is upon me now, even as it was then, fresh and vivid, in all its wild fascination. “Oh! sir,” were the first words which she said, “I beseech you save him, save my brother!” CHAPTER XXII. “Your brother!” I echoed; and, in the silence which ensued, rapidly perused the beautiful face before me. Would that the pen could do the office of the pencil! Her complexion was clear brown, with lips and cheeks of vivid red—the very blossom and bloom of spotless and virginal loveliness. Her nose was slightly aquiline, her brows arched, her eyes large and oval-shaped, and of a color that trembled between the calm blue of noonday and the brilliant darkness of midnight. As for her hair, it was swept aside from her forehead in rich masses of jetty blackness. There was intellect in that face, and pride and passion, and a something which words cannot define, and which, until a later day, I was never able to analyze. The first effect of that face was like enchantment; it seized the eye and soul at once. “Your brother?” “My brother! Now in a—a—felon's cell, with the prospect of hopeless imprisonment before him,” she said, reaching her hands toward me and fixing her eyes full on my face. And at that moment, the reality struck me that the face of the boy-burglar was but a caricature of the beautiful countenance on which I gazed—one of those caricatures, of which the world has many examples, in which the face of an ugly brother bears a vivid resemblance to the countenance of a beautiful sister. After she spoke, a pause of at least a minute ensued. Absorbed by the sight of her face, bewildered by the fascination of her loveliness, which seemed to encircle her like a presence and a veil of light, I knew not what to say. “Your brother,” I faltered at last, “has been convicted of burglary—will be sentenced in a few days—how can I save him?” “Oh! sir—bad example, hardship, corrupt associations, have brought him to his present condition. He is not bad at heart. He may yet be redeemed from all his evil habits. But, in any case, save him from a fate worse than death— from the hopeless moral death of the State Prison.” In her intensity she clasped her hands, and bent forward in her chair, her eyes centered upon my face. “Would to heaven you had only applied to me sooner!” I answered, in unfeigned distress. “Something might have been done. But I knew not that he had a friend in the world, much less a sister.” These was a calm bitterness in her accent as she interrupted me. “You knew that he had not a friend in the world? Alas! it is the way of the world! Had he been surrounded with friends you would have been merciful to him. But, reflect, sir, thus friendless and alone, he needed your forgiveness all the more.” “But, why did you not appear before?” I asked, somewhat hurt by the calm bitterness of her tone. “I did not see your face in court. You were not present in the hour of his trial!” She grew red and pale by turns, and I saw the veins of her white throat swell as with suppressed agitation: “Alas, alas! I could not be there, it was out of my power—utterly out of my power.” And with evident signs of distress she shaded her eyes with her hand. “But how can I save your brother now?” I said. “You have influence,” she answered, without removing her gloved hand from her eyes; “you have rich connections; you have wealth—and—” suddenly lifting her head, she flung the full brightness of her gaze upon me,—“what is there that cannot be done by the aid of— wealth?” Her nether lip trembled with a perceptible tremor, and she beat the carpet with her foot. For a moment I sat silent and bewildered, scarcely knowing whether the woman before me was a reality or the creation of a dream. At last I said, in a firm and measured tone,—“Your brother is to be sentenced the day after to-morrow. To-morrow I will do all I can for him. At all events, I will induce the judge to join with me in procuring your brother's pardon from the governor.” The words had scarcely fallen from me, ere she bounded from her chair, seized my hand and pressed it to her lips. “God bless you! God bless you!” she cried, and then sank back in her chair, covering her face with her hands and weeping. I could not help sharing her agitation. “Where shall I see you to-morrow to communicate to you the result of my exertions?” I asked, anxious to remove the embarrassment of the moment. “Shall I wait upon you at your home?” “No—no—no!” she responded quickly, and with an accent of indescribable bitterness. “Not there—not there!” She rose from her seat and gathered her shawl over her bust. “To-morrow night, at this hour, I will wait upon you here.” She drew her veil over her face, and, without a sign or word of adieu, hurried from the room. She was gone ere I was aware of her intention to depart. Gone! leaving me absorbed and bewildered by the vivid impression of her presence. For a few moments I sat silent and wondering, and then, seizing my cap and cloak, hurried from the parlor and from the house, anxious to carry out an idea which had suddenly flashed upon my brain. A strange, wild idea, which came upon me like an inspiration, and which urged me far from my mansion, resolved upon its immediate execution. I was absent from my house for hours. When I returned, it was late at night, and the candle in the parlor had burned to the last gleam. Seating myself by the fireplace, where the coals among the ashes emitted an uncertain light, I gave myself up to the silent contemplation of the scenes I had beheld, the words I had heard since my departure from the mansion some hours before. And the contemplation harrowed me to the soul. “Can it be that the scenes I have just witnessed are real? that the words which I have heard are anything but idle sounds heard in a dream? Can such things exist, under the glittering mantle of New-York wealth and New-York luxury?” Thus I found myself murmuring my thoughts aloud, by the dim fire-light. Alas! alas! too well I knew that all I had witnessed that evening was sad reality. I had heard, I had seen. Did not the bitter truths of my own life render possible the darkest and apparently the most improbable tragedies of every-day life? Still, what I had heard and seen (during my absence of a few hours) made me shudder at the very recollection. That night I slept but little. Next day was full of work, of hurry and incident for me. In the morning, I busied myself with the case of the boy-burglar, and in the afternoon went to a private dinner-party, given by a jovial merchant—a fat round man of fifty, as fond of his bottle as of a rise in stocks, with a shining bald head, set off by a few veteran gray hairs—to some eight or nine select guests. Fancy a snug little room, the curtains drawn, the champagne and hoc in ice, the fire burning cheerily in the grate, and (although the hour was early) some seven or eight wax candles, disposed along the white cloth of a well-loaded board. It was altogether a bachelor's dinner; and, after the cloth was removed, we disposed ourselves comfortably in our cushioned armchairs and began upon the wine; that is all, save me. For myself, I had important reasons for keeping my head clear. Among the guests there were two who especially attracted my interest. One was a man of the world, who, for twenty years, had been a prominent actor in New-York life, Burley Hayne, sometimes called Captain Hayne, whose tall form and broad shoulders were severely clad in black, with a heavy gold chain across the dark satin waistcoat. Burley had been handsome, but now there were wrinkles about his protuberant eyes, and deeper and uglier wrinkles near the corners of his large mouth. His teeth were still good, and only a few stray gray hairs (thanks, perchance, to Goureaud) appeared on his bushy dark whiskers and thickly-curling black hair. Burley was a man of the world of a certain sort. He read nothing save a sporting paper. He was familiar with the niceties of faro. He loved to eat good dinners—at the house of a wealthy friend. He liked good wine, and liked it best when it came from other people's cellars. He was a duellist, too, and had killed his man on more occasions than one. Fashionable tailors looked up to him, and rarely asked him for pay. To complete his character, he was a bachelor, and looked upon women with not the most remote taint of platonic or sentimental nonsense. Whether he had a sister, I know not, but certainly he had long forgotten that he ever had a mother. Such was Burley Hayne, who, easy and well-preserved, sat opposite me, making the table roar with a few pages from the manifold adventures of his life —adventures which no one would think of telling within the golden covers of a New-Year's annual. I may remark that the gallant captain was deeply in my debt for borrowed money. Beside Burley, listening to his jokes, and laughing at them in a shrill voice, was an older man of the world, very tall and lean, with a narrow forehead, haggard face, and big bloodshotten and feverish eyes. Dressed with much nicety, with high shirt collar, black stock and ruffled bosom, this gentleman, who may have been about fifty—he looked sixty—bore every appearance of a man of the world pretty thoroughly used up, and still with the feverish memories of past enjoyments burning in his bloodshot eyes. There was something pitiful in the way in which this antediluvian man of the world, called Col. Elephalet Cloud, hung upon every accent of the fresher and more modern Captain Burley Hayne. A stranger could not help thinking, that, somehow or other, the captain held the colonel in his power. Well, we sat at our wine, by the pleas ant light of the wax candles, and in the cheerful warmth of the fire; every face, from that of our jocund host, at the head of the table, to that of the cadaverous Colonel Eliphalet Cloud, convulsed with laughter as Burley related his adventures—every face save mine. I was quiet and grave; if I did laugh, the laugh was forced and hollow. Perhaps the thought of my appointment in the evening with the sister of the young felon, kept me grave; perhaps—well! perhaps— Burley's adventures were of the most interesting character. Now, it was a story of a race-course; now, of a gambling scene into which he had unexpectedly happened; now, of a duel, in which he had winged his man just between the eyes; and now, there was a lady in the case—it was always something quaint and very rich. But the crowning story of the evening was about a trout-fishing excursion which Burley had taken the previous summer into some lake country of a New-England State. He had put up at the house of a quiet farmer, near the lake, and been made at home as a welcome guest. The farmer and his wife had an only daughter, a rosy girl of seventeen. Burley staid a few weeks at the house, trout-fishing and—making love. Time came for him to leave, and, under promise of marriage, he induced the farmer's pretty daughter, one night, to leave her home and come with him to New-York. She came with him, and— “The fact is, gentlemen,” continued Burley, shutting one eye, as he took a look at a candle through a long-necked glass, brimming with champagne, “she was so rosy, so blooming, and so innocent, so d——d innocent, do you know,” he looked round with an expression of the most grotesque serio-comic character, “that she actually expected me to marry her!” “Expected you to marry her!” echoed Col. Cloud in his shrill voice, and he followed his exclamation with a screech of the shrillest laughter. “Good! Egad! Ah! What next?” The host at the table also laughed, and then looked grave, as though a little ashamed of his laughter; but, as for the other guests, warm as they were with wine, they made the room ring again. “And what became of her, captain?” asked Col. Cloud, his haggard features twitching nervously, and his bloodshot eyes shining with unusual feverishness, —“What became of the dear little—little—robin red-breast?” The captain passed his hand through his bushy black hair, and made a grimace which showed at once the capacity of his mouth, and the whiteness of his teeth. “Well! the fact is, I lost sight of her for a month or two. You know these kind of adventures come and go, and a man soon forgets 'em. But I did meet her last night—” “Last night!” echoed the shrill old man of the world. “You would not have known her, by —! you would not! My pretty country girl had become a city lady! She was paler than when I first saw her on the farm, but her eyes were brighter, and she was draped in black, elegantly draped in black. And she was—walking Broadway! Egad, walking Broadway!” “Walking Broadway!” cried Colonel Eliphalet Cloud. “They all come to that!” The room again rung with laughter; the host, at the head of the table, did not laugh so loudly as before; as for myself, silent and grave, I sat quietly marking figures on the table with some wine which I had spilt. My absent manner was at length remarked. “By —! What's the matter with you?” inquired the captain, leaning over the table and fixing his protuberant eyes upon me. “Have you got the blues, Van Warner? You look as glum—as glum—” “As an Egyptian mummy, unrolled by Gliddon, for example,” facetiously cried Col. Cloud. “What are you thinking about, Van Warner?” continued Burley Hayne. “Of the story which you have just told,” I said, quietly; and as I spoke, somehow or other, a dead silence fell upon the company. “And what do you think about it?” said the captain, rather pointedly, in his deep, hoarse voice. “Why, captain,” I returned, playing in an absent manner with the neck of my glass, a great many words might be expended in developing my opinion of your story, but for the present I will confine myself to an expression of my opinion of you. Here, also, a great deal of eloquence might be wasted. I will therefore put my opinion in the simplest form and fewest words. Captain Burley Hayne —” “Well!” gasped the captain, very red in the face. “Captain Burley Hayne, you are a liar and a coward!” CHAPTER XXIII. These words, firmly pronounced, were followed by a dead stillness; the captain from red, turned livid. He was a terrible man when excited, and was evidently struggling with his rage. “W-e-ll, by —!” he gasped, and made a movement, as if about to rise from his chair. But I gave him no time. I dashed the contents of my glass full in his face; and then, with the words distinctly said. “A coward and a liar, Captain Burley Hayne!” I dashed the glass itself into his face, it striking him on the forehead, between the eyes, and splintering in fragments over the table. There was a silence like death, and then an uproar like Babel. Never had I beheld a more terrible image of mad rage than Hayne presented as he rose to his feet, his forehead covered with blood and small fragments of broken glass. His rage choked him—he could not speak. “Gentlemen! gentlemen! this can be settled elsewhere,” cried the host, from the head of the table. “Yes, gentlemen! gentlemen!” buzzed a half-dozen voices, “elsewhere! elsewhere! An affair of honor! No apology after this!—must fight!” At last the captain found voice, and his voice gradually grew more like the roar of a maddened buffalo than any other sound. “Elsewhere?” he roared, extending his huge, brawny arms, as though he was about to reach over the table, grasp me, and crush me to powder with his iron fists. “Elsewhere? No! now—now! —in this room!” And he made a movement, as though about to spring upon the table. “Captain Hayne,” I said, slowly, “you can come on—and now!—but before you can lay your hand upon me, I will lay you dead at my feet.” I drew a small revolving pistol from the breast of my dress coat, and, stepping back a single step, covered the captain's forehead with a deliberate aim. Did this movement cow him? He sank back into his chair, grating his teeth, so that the sound could be heard over the whole room. “Well, you must fight me!” he said, wiping the blood and fragments of glass from his forehead, “and I will kill you. That is all. Morgan, (to a gentleman on his left,) you will act as my friend?” “Clifton,” said I, to a gentleman on my right, “I ask you to act as my friend. And, captain, take my word for it, I will meet and fight you where you please, but you will not kill me.” Still holding the pistol, I sat down. The scene was a mixture of a good deal of the serious and much of the funny. Clifton and Morgan, (both “fast” gentlemen of the world,) were already arranging preliminaries in a corner; the host was pale as death; the other guests gazed first at me and then at Hayne, with much the look of men who have chanced into a powder magazine on the eve of an explosion; and as for Colonel Eliphalet Cloud, drawing nearer to the younger men of the world, to whom he looked up with mingled reverence and fear, he whispered, but not so low but that I could hear him,—“You'll wing him, Burley, my boy! Between the eyes you'll wing him!” Burley pushed him gently aside, and then, looking over the table, said in a low voice, very hoarse and full of emotion,—“After what has passed, Mr. Van Warner, very few words can pass between us. We must fight, and I must kill you. But, once for all, I should like to know how I have ever harmed you? You are neither friend nor relation of this girl? How, then, have I harmed you?” Resting my elbows on the table, and my cheeks between my hands, I bent forward, and looked fixedly at the captain, and said in a low voice,—“That, captain, I will tell you, after I have shot you and just before you die.” Did I speak a mere bravado? Was there some cause of hatred between the captain and myself, other than his brutal story about the poor New-England girl? Did I feel confident that I would be able to make good my words? The captain regarded me with a curious look—a kind of mingled wonder, curiosity and hate—and then, rising from the chair, went to the fireplace, and leaned his head against the mantel. The jovial host (not very jovial now) came near him, and whispered him, but the captain pushed him gently away. “Gentlemen,” said the bland Morgan, “all is arranged.” “A quiet field near Weehawk—time, to-morrow, near daybreak—weapons, pistols,” added Clifton, the other fast man. “And, egad!” said the evil old man of the world, Col. Eliphalet Cloud, with an ominous twitch of his cadaverous lineaments, as he regarded me across the table—“he'll wing you, young man; he will!” In a little while the party broke up, and I returned thoughtfully homeward, just as evening was gathering over the countless multitude of Broadway. Once in my home again, I awaited the hour of my appointment with the sister of the felon, in a state of feverish anxiety. The hour—eight o'clock—came. The candle was lighted on the centre-table— the fire burned brightly on the hearth— the parlor was silent and lonely. Seated near the table, with my eyes fixed on the door, I listened to every sound, and every instant expected the opening of the door and the appearance of the lady. Half an hour after, the time transpired, and yet she came not. Had anything occurred to prevent her fulfilling her appointment? Could the scenes of the previous night which I had beheld, (and of which I will plainly speak in due time,) have prevented her from coming to my house? “The lady whom you expected, sir,” said the liveried servant, suddenly breaking my reveries, as he opened the door; and across the threshold, thickly veiled, came the sister of the felon; thickly veiled, and the dark shawl gathered closely about her bust. As she sank into a seat she panted for breath, and looked nervously over her shoulder, like one who is afraid of being pursued. “You are faithful to your appointment, miss,” I said, breaking a long pause. She did not remove her veil, nor could I discern a single feature of her face, as she said in a low, tremulous, but earnest voice,—“And you, sir! Oh! have you been successful?” I had much to say to her, but I knew not how to begin. “Lady, I wish you to listen to me for a few moments, and to listen patiently, —” thus I spoke. “Before I inform you of the result of my endeavors in regard to your brother, I wish you to hear the details of an adventure connected with my own life.” I paused—there was a movement of her veil. “Your own life!” she echoed, in a tone of deep surprise. “Yes, my own life; and if you promise to be patient and hear me to the end, I will tell you the adventure.” “I promise,” she said in a monotonous tone, as though the subject did not concern her in the least, and placed her gloved hand languidly upon the table. “Well, miss, one night in spring, not many years ago, I was strolling along Broadway, when I felt myself interested in a young lady, dressed in black, and found myself unconsciously following in her footsteps. A glimpse of her face, which I caught as she for a moment paused in front of a store, and lifted her veil, filled me with an intense desire to know her history. “Although she was very beautiful, there was care upon her face, and traces of some sad, dark history there; her very attire, that of a lady of wealth and taste, still wearing the marks of respectable poverty, increased my desire to know more of her. She entered the store; unperceived I followed. It was one of those stores where they sell rich embroidered work; and while I stood near her, (apparently examining some fine specimens of such work,) she drew from beneath her shawl a piece of embroidery which had cost her two weeks' labor, as she told the proprietor of the store. For this she received a small sum in gold, say five dollars, which she clutched with an eager grasp, and hurriedly left the store. “Still, I followed her.” “You followed her?” echoed the sister of the felon, beating her hand gently against the table. “Followed her to her home in a distant part of the city, into a large house, (tenanted apparently by many families,) and up four pair of stairs. Now, her home was composed of two rooms, and a small closet or anteroom, which communicated with the main passage. Gliding, unperceived, in her footsteps, I followed her into this anteroom, and stood in the darkness there, gazing, through a small glass window, into one of the rooms. I remained there for an hour, or more. I heard much—saw much.” For a moment I paused; the young lady did not seem to manifest much interest in my story; her little hand still beat the table; as for her face, I could not trace its emotions through her veil. “The room which met my gaze was neatly but poorly furnished. The carpet was faded; a miserable wood-stove stood near the wall; and a lady's work-basket, evidently the relic of happier days, stood upon the table, near the lighted candle. From my place of concealment I saw the young lady, as she approached the light, and flung her bonnet on the chair, and never saw so much loveliness, so much despair, combined in the same face. She gazed, wearily, around the room, and then, with a shudder, staggered to the door which led into the second apartment. `Oh! my God!' I could hear her exclaim, `where will all this end?' “Even as she spoke, the door of the second apartment opened, and an old man came forth, his haggard face betraying much agitation, his finger on his lips. “`Hush! he is there!' I heard him whisper in a low voice, pointing cautiously to the room which he had just left. `What money have you, child? We have been taking a quiet game, and must have wine. The wine store is at the corner; just put on your bonnet, and get us two bottles of the best champagn, Heidsick brand, you will remember!' “The poor girl placed the gold coin, the result of two weeks' labor, in his tremulous hand—he grasped it eagerly, but did not stir from her seat. `Why do you not go, daughter,' said the old man, evidently much surprised. `He is in there, and will grow impatient.' “`Sit down by me, father,' said the young lady, who had grown very pale. I want to say a few words to you.' “He sat down, wondering, and she said a few words. Oh! I heard every word!” The sister of the felon suffered her hand to drop upon her knee, as if she wished to avoid pressing it against her bosom, which now rose and fell, perceptibly, beneath the folds of her shawl. `You heard every word!” she said, in an almost inarticulate tone. “Heard her every word, heard the story of her life, and of the old man who sat beside her; how that old man, when a young and wealthy man, and living in a New-England town, had been deluded into evil courses while on a visit to New-York; how, from a wealthy and respected man, he became a gambler, squandered his wealth, the fortune of his wife, the very bread and future of his little children; how he left that wife to die of a broken heart, and left the children friendless and motherless, to try alone the hard battle of the world. He was never afterwards seen in his native town.” “What became of the children? One of them, a girl, grew up in the family of a stranger, and learned to get her bread by her needle. After toiling for years in her native town, she left that town and came to New-York, eager to find her brother, who had disappeared a year before. In New-York she supported herself virtuously by her needle, using all her efforts to discover her lost brother, but in vain. “`And, father! I did not find my brother,' she continued, as I stood listening in the anteroom, `but you found me out, and made yourself known to me. For the first time in many years I saw you. You made your home with me. Since the hour you first came here, six months ago, till now, I have worked for you, father, worked until now,—not to give you home and bread,—but worked night and day to supply you with money for wine and for the gambling table. Father, I now tell you that I can do so no longer?' “Her lifted finger, her pallid face, the calm, deep resolution of her tone, all took the old man by surprise. “`Why, why,' faltered he, `what is all this? Girl, what's the matter?' “`The matter is, father, that to-day, at last, I have found my brother!' “`Found your brother?' echoed the old man, with idiotic surprise. `Where!' “`It matters not to relate, father, how I found him, but I will tell you where,' was her reply. `I found him in the Tombs, in a felon's cell.' “She hid her face in her hands; the old man looked frightened and vacant, as though stupified by a heavy blow. “`And so, father!' continued the young lady, `we will have no more cards, no more wine,—at least, while your son, my brother, wears the chains of a convict.' “Scarce had the words fallen from her lips, when the door of the second apartment again opened, and a second man came forth—” Here I paused. “Shall I go on?” I said to the young lady, who sat statue-like before me. Her hands had fallen helplessly to her side. Her veiled face was slightly dropped to her bosom. “Go on, go!” she said, in a scarce articulate voice,—“Do not mind me! Do not mind me, go on!” “A second man came forth—a man whom I recognized at a glance as one of the notorious men of New-York. I saw him approach the young lady, heard him call her by her proper name. She rose from her seat; I could not see her face, but saw her shrink away from him, step by step, as though he had been a noxious reptile. “Again I heard him familiarly call her by name. “`— You need not be afraid of me,' he said, in his hoarse voice, `the partition is thin: in fact, I was listening, and heard all—all. Don't you see additional reason for complying with the proposition which I made to your father a month ago? Do this and I will save your brother, and lift your father from this miserable place to comfort—affluence.' He stopped as if awaiting for her reply. She gave it promptly. CHAPTER XXIV. “`This promise of comfort — affluence, comes from a gentleman who for months has not hesitated to drink wine and play at cards from the hard earnings of a poor girl—a gentleman who has played upon the fears and tremors of an old man, in order to rob him, and who has used his power over that old man in the attempt to corrupt his daughter.' “These words seemed to sting the gambler to the quick. “`Well, my lady,' he cried fiercely, `do as you please. Only remember that I hold a paper, to which your father sometime ago had the indiscretion to sign another man's name.' “This threat evidently terrified the young girl; it struck the old man with `fear and trembling.' “As for the gambler, he took his hat and cloak, and left the room without another word. He brushed past me as I stood concealed in the anteroom. I only remained a moment longer there. Gazing through the glass, I saw the young girl standing with clasped hands and pallid face—despair in every line of that face. “`Daughter,' I heard the old man say, `you must consent.' To which came the reply— “`Do you think so, father? O would, in the hour that you broke my mother's heart, that you had completed your work, and killed your children! thus saving your son from a convict's chains, and your daughter from —.' She stopped and hid her face. I heard and saw no more.” My story was done. I looked upon the veiled woman who sat before me, anxious to discover what effect it had upon her. Gathering her hands from her side, she pressed them violently to her bosom, for an instant only, and then flung up her veil. Pale, very pale, was that beautiful face; but there was firmness in the compressed lips—there was wild fire in the eyes. There was a swelling of the muscles of the throat, a heaving of the bosom palpable through the thick shawl which covered it; and then, leaning forward, and fixing her gaze full upon me, she said,—“And you saw and heard all—you.” She put her hand to her throat as if her utterance was choked. “Yes, I saw and heard all,” was my reply. “Yes, Eugenia Cloud! and before this time to-morrow Captain Burley Hayne will meet his death by my hand.” There is no language to depict the effect which these words had upon her. Her face lighted up with a strange, wild look, as though a flash of lightning had passed over it. “You—you—you!” she seized my hands and wrung them in her own— “you will save my father from this man; you—will save him—” “Captain Burley Hayne shall surrender the paper, by which he holds your father in his power, or he will meet his death at my hand.” She resumed her seat. “Cannot my father be saved without bloodshed?” she said, in a voice of deep sadness. “Must one crime be avoided only by another crime? If you”—she shuddered—“if you kill him it will be —murder, and you will have to fly. And then—.” She hesited, and fixed her gaze upon me with a look which I could not define. “Captain Burley Hayne has been long enough abroad. It is a crime to take life, but not a crime to take a life like his—to prevent him from the commission of a thousand crimes worse than murder. I may have to fly,” I continued, as though thinking aloud. “Well, be it so. I will save you. My life itself is a wreck. There is no living thing to care for me. Come flight, disgrace, the stigma of murderer! so that I can only save you!” “But,” and the color glowed warmly over her throat and face, “he is a practised duellist. He may kill you—.” Her look, the tremor which agitated her frame, said more than her words. What strange thought was this which, at her look, began to take shape and rise like a phantom from the depths of my heart? I crushed it as I rose, and said calmly and bitterly— “Eugenia, my life, I repeat it, is a wreck. I survey my wealth, I wander through the lonely rooms of this grand mansion, I essay every pleasure, try every experiment of work and pleasure which the world offers to me, and, after all, find myself only a solitary and blasted man. It may end the sorrows, it may atone for the crimes of a life like mine, to spend my blood in a cause so holy as yours.” I spoke not in affectation of sentiment or heroism, nor in the spirit of bravado, but from an impulse which was as strong upon me at this moment, as it had been for the last twenty-four hours—an impulse which I cannot define even if I would. 5 I rose and paced the floor, now in light, now in shadow. As, after a long silence, I turned in my walk, Eugenia confronted me, her face turned from the light, her hand extended. “This must not be,” she said, in a firm, although tremulous voice,—“You must not peril your life for me. Save my poor brother from a felon's chains— it is all I dare ask! As for myself, I have struggled against misfortunes thus far—I can struggle still—and if the worst comes—” “If the worst comes, you can marry Captain Burley Hayne, and become, not only his wife, but the instrument of new impostures upon society, planned by him.” She drew nearer to me, and, to my surprise, put her hand upon my shoulder; her eyes flashed as if all her soul was in their light. “Marry Captain Hayne—marry him? Is it fair, is it generous, is it manly, for you to use your knowledge of my position in order to insult me thus? Marry him? No; if the worst comes, I can— die.” Her hand trembled as it touched my shoulder; her face was very near mine; the alternate glow and pallor of her face; the vivid brightness of her eyes; the clear, calm resolution of her forehead, all were before and very near me, and the magnetism of her presence was around and about me. “No! Eugenia, you shall not die! Your life is worth a thousand such as mine. Last night, as I saw you at your home, and listened to you there, it seemed to me as if I had known you from very childhood. I then determined to peril all, dare all, for you; and I will do it.” She interrupted me. What power was there in the words she said? They changed the course of my life. Let others moralize; I only state facts. “Live, then, for my sake,” she said, her face so near me that her breath was on my cheek, and her head drooped forward until it rested against my breast, her hand still trembling on my shoulder. At her words the dark way of my life seemed suddenly lit up with light from heaven! I stood like one entranced. “Live for my sake!” she whispered, raising her face; her eyes were all the brighter for their tears. Let me be your sister! Let me still continue my humble way of life, but be near you always, in sorrow and in danger! When all is well with you in your rich home, then I will keep apart; but when sorrow comes, and you need consolation and the presence of one true to you, as sister to dearest brother, then I will be with you!” Why did something in her words grate horribly on my soul? “Sister—never!” I echoed; and put my hand gently on her forehead, and bent down to her face. “On one condition I promise not to peril my own life, not to shed the blood of Captain Hayne. Be my wife.” “Never! It cannot be! The world would say I became yours for your wealth. I am not worthy of you. My brother a convict; my father—oh! you know what he is! Your wife! Never— never!” “It is well, Eugenia. You have pronounced my fate,” I said, coldly; and, taking her hand from my shoulder, walked into the shadows of the parlor. When I turned again, she was standing where I left her, her hands joined in front of her form, her eyes absent and dreamy. Although the shadow was on her face, it was plainly to be seen that she was terribly agitated. “Your brother, in consideration of his youth, and of representations made by myself and the judge, will receive his pardon before Saturday”—I began, endeavoring to assume a calm. “Oh! I know not what to do!” she said, as though speaking to herself. “For years denied the blessing of a mother's counsel and a mother's love, I have struggled on alone. Marry! It will be said I sold myself for wealth. The disgrace attached to my family will attach itself to him.” “Eugenia,” said I, drawing near to her, “I was wrong to present to you such a hideous alternative as marriage or— bloodshed. Forgive me. And then, as your hand was on my shoulder, as your breath was on my cheek, I forgot that I must meet the captain to-morrow, fight him, or be disgraced forever. I must meet him—fight him—there is no other way. Let me beg you to allow matters to take their course. Return home, and hope for the best. In any case, your brother will be pardoned, and whatever is the event of to-morrow, you will be saved from all chance—(of poverty I was about to add, but I said)—from all chance of harm.” Was it merely surprise that mantled over her face? Or, did she by an almost supernatural effort, regain her composure? After a moment's thought she bade me “good-evening!” in a calm voice, and turned toward the door. There she seemed to linger as if in hesitation, but it was for a moment only. She opened the door; she did not once look back; she crossed the threshold. I stood gazing upon the space made black and vacant by her departure. But in an instant there was a wild cry, and the sound of rapid footsteps; there were arms outstretched, and a woman's voice, speaking in broken impetuous tones; and—a woman's face pillowed on my breast. The blank space left by her departure was filled again and shining with heavenly light. And words, scarce articulate for sobs and tears, said to me: “Avoid bloodshed! avoid crime!—I will be your wife!” It is a pitiful thing that, while the dark passages of every life may be described, the best and holiest moments that brighten the drear way of this world are too pure, too sacred, to be told again. Over the joy of that moment, when, in the dimly-lighted parlor, Eugenia—a tempted but stainless woman, sobbing in my arms, her cheek to mine, her lips to mine, her heart to mine, —vowed to be the sharer of my fate— over the joy of that moment drop the veil. Should I not here apologize to the cynics and worldlings of both sexes (the woman worldling, the hardest of all,) who perchance will read this page, for this confession of a spotless and sacred emotion? * * * Ere an hour passed, I went with Eugenia to her humble home. Her father was not there; he was, in all probability, in the company of Captain Hayne, helping to arrange “the preliminaries” of the morrow's duel. I left her at the threshold. “Remember your promise—at all hazards, avoid bloodshed!” I raised her gloved hand to my lips, and left her in the doorway, one side of her beautiful face touched by the light which shone from within. “Shall I ever see her again?” the thought came up, ugly and almost palpable, as I went down the dark stairway. Avoid bloodshed— how? Stung by the persecution which I had seen Eugenia suffer from the captain; disgusted by the shameless acts which stained his whole career; reckless of my own existence; driven forward by an impulse which I could not control, I had planned, I had executed the scene of the dinner-table. The captain bore my mark upon his forehead. A challenge had passed; a duel would take place to-morrow, just after dinner—how avoid bloodshed? “If I fire in the air, the captain will shoot me; if I do not fire in the air, I will shoot him! Bloodshed must be avoided; for now I have something to live for; but how shall it be avoided?” Thus I cogitated as I strolled down Broadway. CHAPTER XXV. “How shall I avoid bloodshed?” was the question which troubled me as I strolled down Broadway. I put my hand upon my vest pocket and felt a small piece of manuscript, which I had carried there for a month and more—a very precious manuscript which a mercantile friend of mine, Mr. Jardine, of undoubted character, had given me as an equivalent for the sum of five hundred and fifty dollars. It was, in a word, a check, signed by a prominent firm in New-York, Firkin &amp; Smalley, and given to my mercantile friend aforesaid, by a strange gentleman of plausible manners, in exchange for certain wines of highest price and rarest flavor. After receiving this check, I had, in due time, presented it to Messrs. Firkin &amp; Smalley at their counter, instead of going to their bank at once, and, with a good deal of indignation, they had pronounced it a forgery. I begged them to remain quiet in the matter, and made the same request to Mr. Jardine. Thus a month or more passed away. During this month, aided by Mr. Jardine, and a police officer, who looked as demure as a country parson, but was in fact as cunning as any fox in Esop, I had amused my leisure hours in the attempt to discover the plausible stranger who had presented the check. Had I succeeded? Some four days ago my investigation came to a close. That was before I knew anything of Eugenia or her brother. And those investigations all terminated at the door of a certain gentleman, fashionable in his address, and (when the humor seizes him) most plausible in his manners. Well! The paper is safe! Shall I use it? That was a very nice question. That little bit of paper properly used, and— there would be no duel on the morrow. Gentlemen who occupy apartments in that elegant public hotel known as the Tombs, are not precisely at liberty to walk abroad, much less to fight duels. But would it be honorable in me to invoke the aid of the magical little fragment of paper, which bore on one corner, in elegant numerals, the representation of five hundred and fifty dollars, and in another, the mercantile scrawl of Firkin &amp; Smalley? Honorable? On the other hand, would it be honorable for me to stand up in single combat against a professed duellist, gambler, debauchee; and who, to his other cardinal virtues, had lately added the unobtrusive practice of—forgery? A very nice question, look at it as you will. Much troubled by this delicate question, I strolled down Broadway, and unconsciously approached the Park. The night had grown cloudy, and something between a fog and a drizzle obscured the lamps in the Park. The leafless trees arose, grotesque and vague in the misty air. Broadway was almost deserted. A single person stood at the corner of a street which extends from Broadway toward the North River—a very demure-looking person, with sadcolored clothes, an imperturbable countenance, and a white cravat. I approached this person; it was the particular police officer, whom I will call Mr. Pittson. “Ah! is that you, Mr. Van Warner? You are out rather late. Coming home from the opera, I suppose?” “And you—what do you out so late, Mr. Pittson?” that gentleman extended his hand, and pointed down the street which led towards the North River. All was dark there; the street lamps had been extinguished; the only thing which relieved the gloom was a light which shone from an upper room of a four-storied mansion. “A fine light, that. I have been watching it,” said Mr. Pittson, quietly. “There's something very interesting in that light, Mr. Van Warner.” The room from which the light shone was in the fourth story of a large edifice. The ground floor, and second and third stories, were used for mercantile purposes, alive all day with the hum of business, but at night silent as a tomb. The rooms in the fourth story, silent all day, were always at night, especially late at night, lighted up as if for a festival. Late at night, low music broke the silence of these rooms—music so low that it could only be heard by a practised ear—the soft rustling of small pieces of pasteboard, and the sharp quick rattling of ivory balls. These rooms, in a word, were the residence and the secret temple of Captain Burley Hayne. “He is there now, I guess,” whispered Pittson. “Aint it about time to give him a call?” “You remember your promise, Pittson—this matter is entirely in my hands. You will not take a single step without my consent?” “Of course,” emphatically responded Pittson, arranging his white cravat. “Well, I wish to have a few words in private with Captain Hayne. I will ascend to his room. You will follow me, and station yourself in the dark outside of his door. And, when I call your name, you will enter the room, and proceed as I may direct. You comprehend?” “I do,” was his prompt reply, uttered by Pittson with a peculiar twinkle of his sharp eyes. And I went down the street; and stealthily, some twenty paces after me, came Pittson, his India rubber shoes giving not the slightest echo of a footstep. As I ascended in the dark toward the captain's rooms, I had by no means decided upon the course which I was to pursue. Arrest him, in order to avoid the duel? I did not like the thought. Force him to sign a paper in which he will confess that he was justly assaulted, and decline to meet me in single combat? The latter looked more plausible, but I knew not which course to take. “I will see him first, and leave the result to chance,” I muttered, as I stood in the dark at the captain's door. Chance! is a word which always leaves a very wide margin. I knocked at the door; there was no reply. All was breathlessly still. Again I knocked, and still there was no sound from within. After some hesitation I tried the door—it was not locked—I opened it, and crossed the threshold. The captain's room was lighted by a candle, which stood in the centre of a large table covered with green cloth. It would require a great many words to give anything like a correct idea of the place. It was elegantly carpeted, pleasantly warmed, and one side of it was occupied by a huge sideboard, covered with glasses, decanters, and cold viands. The space above the mantel was decorated with fencing-foils, boxing-gloves, and the satin slipper of an opera dancer. As for the walls, they displayed four or five pictures, in heavy gilt frames—pictures suggestive of the social state of ancient Greece and Rome in their worst days. The table itself spoke volumes; there was a file of sporting papers; a pack of cards, bran new; a case of duelling pistols, and a glass of brandy and water. And at the table, in a cushioned arm-chair, sat Captain Burley Hayne, his head dropped on his ruffled shirt, his hand laid listlessly on the table itself, evidently fast asleep. His dark hair was tangled and disordered, and threw a shadow over his face. He had been overcome by exhaustion, in the midst of his virtuous labors, and was in a profound sleep. I coughed; made a noise with my feet; but the captain did not stir. Determined to converse with him, I called his name loud and louder,—“Captain Hayne! Captain Hayne!” but still he did not show the slightest sign of awaking from his slumber. “I thought you called,” said a voice, and the demure Pittson stood at my shoulder. I turned to him angrily—“Wait without, as I directed!” But Pittson, in stead of leaving the room, advanced to the table, took the light, and raised it to the captain's face. It was something of a contrast: the thin frame and sharp visage of the policeman, and the broad, burly form and bushy head of the captain. After a keen survey of a moment, Pittson put down the candle, and turned to me, with an oath—a rare thing for him—indeed, I had never before heard a profane word from his lips. “By —! that man will be hard to wake! Dead as a grindstone!” “Dead! You are jesting!” I cried, and passed round the table. I shook the captain roughly by the shoulder; he did not move. I pushed aside his bushy hair and raised his head; the light, for the first time, shone fully in his face. A horrible face! Mouth agape; complexion yellow and livid; eyes fixed in a glassy stare; a horrible face, with death printed in every lineament. “Suicide!” I cried, shrinking back horror-stricken, as I saw the stain of blood on his vest, over the left breast. “A pistol shot, anyhow!” exclaimed Pittson, bending over the table, and shading his eyes, as he examined the marks left by the pistol bullet in its passage. “Not by suicide—no! no! But by my hand!” said a strange voice, clear and ringing in its every accent. CHAPTER XXVI. And from the door of the next apartment — suddenly opened — came the speaker, a young woman, whose hair fell disordered and in tangled masses about her face. Her bonnet was crushed upon her head, as if by a heavy blow; her attire, gay and tawdry, was damp with rain, and soiled with the mud of the streets. And framed in the crushed bonnet and matted hair, appeared a face not long ago rosy and blooming with all the life of seventeen, but now as colorless as the visage of a corpse; the only life in it was the wild feverish glare of the expanded eyes. Clenching her head, with her tawdry shawl, dangling from one arm to the floor, she came forward with a rapid step. “I did it. Am proud of the deed! To-night—not an hour ago, I met him at the corner of the next street. I asked him for a dollar, for I was houseless. He refused me and passed on. I ran side by side with him, and clung to his arm, telling him how he had brought me from my home, and after all his oaths and promises had left me to walk the streets of New-York,—to—to—to—” her utterance grew thick and hysterical. “And he thrust me aside, and when I clung to him again, he struck me—yes, he struck me! And then passed on, not caring whether I lay dead upon the side-walk But I was not dead; I followed him and found him here in his room, examining his pistols by the light of the candle. As I entered, I seized one of the pistols; it was loaded, thank God! I fired—and, killed him,—killed him, do you hear?” She stopped, and the echoes of her hysterical bursts of laughter sounded strange and horrible in that room, where death sat in hideous reality. “Oh! you base, bad man she cried, approaching the chair, and looking at the corpse, as though it were still the living Captain Burley Hayne. “Oh! you base, bad man, had you no shame? Not one throb of feeling? Were you indeed human? How could you treat me thus? You know what you told me when you took me from my home; how you had a better home for me here, in New-York; and what a dear good wife I would be to you; and now you sit there dead—and I—O my God! look at me! What am I?” The violence of her emotions, the madness which for an hour had filled her veins, now flung her into a deathlike swoon; she fell on her knees, her face resting on her clenched hands, and her hair falling in thick masses over the table. Mr. Pittson, who was a grim, demure man, much accustomed to the sight of overy form of human misery, turned his face from the sight, muttering, as he rubbed the corner of each eye, “Bad papers for you, cap'in! bad papers!” A dead stillness prevailed for a few moments, while the girl, in her swoon, knelt beside the table, and the captain sat hideously erect in his chair. That silence was broken by the voices of two gentlemen, who entered the room from the stairway. “What! Mr. Van Warner, here at this hour!” was the remark of the bland Mr. Morgan, who was evidently deeply surprised when he beheld me. “Come to offer an apology, I suppose?” said his companion, the venerable and wicked Eliphalet Cloud. “Won't do, young man he'll wing you,—a dead shot, a dead shot! He'll —” the words hung on his lips, for his gaze encountered the face of the dead man. The idiotic stare which expanded his eyes as I hurriedly related how, and by whose hands the captain met his death, could only be exceeded in repulsiveness by the fixed glare of the dead man's eyes. Even the composed Morgan grew pale, and sunk back into a chair, covering his face for a moment with his hands. Suddenly, the horror printed on Eliphalet's visage was succeeded by an expression impossible to describe; an expression which reminded you of nothing save a grin on the visage of a corpse. “Dead is he!” I heard him mutter to himself—“D—n him! I rather guess, captain, you won't use that little bit o' paper now.” It was just after day break when I ascended the stairs which led to Eugenia's home. Feverish, from loss of rest, to say nothing of long-continued excitement, I wished to see her at the earliest moment, and tell her that it was no longer needful for me to kill, or be killed in a duel. I passed into the anteroom, and knocked gently at the door. There was no sound in reply, but the door was slightly ajar; I pushed it open and entered. A dim light—the ray of a candle fluttering in its socket—was shed around the humble features of that room. Eugenia was there, on her knees, all unconscious of my presence; her hands clasped, her eyes upraised, her black hair floating over her neck and bosom. There are two expressions, the most inexpressibly beautiful, which by turns pass over the face of a pure and lovely woman. One is when religion fills her being, and sends its calm, holy light to the upraised eyes, shedding over every feature the baptism of a deathless emotion; the other, when pure love (in itself a part—yes, the essence of religion,) first courses in heaven-born sunshine over her face, filling the eyes, blooming like young June on the lip and cheek, while the first time the words “my husband!” tremble on the air. Of these expressions, so beautiful beyond the power of words, that of religion now baptized the face of Eugenia. She was praying; my name was in her prayer and on her lips as I came into the room. As she saw me she bounded to her feet, made a step forward, as though about to spring into my arms, but, pausing where she stood, blushing and beautiful, gasped the words—“It is over then! You are safe! There—there is no stain of blood upon your hands?” “It is over, Eugenia!” I replied. “There is no stain of blood upon my hands. In a word, there has been no duel. Captain Burley Hayne has been summoned to his last account.” “Dead!” she gasped, opening wide her eyes, and growing very pale, as she sunk into a chair. I took my seat beside her, and while she sat, pale and frightened, related the details of the captain's fate. “So sudden!” she interrupted me; “and by a victim's hand. Gone in his sins to his last account! Oh! it is horrible!” A pause ensued, and we sat silently gazing in each other's faces, by the light of the flickering candle. At length, while the early sunshine began to mingle with the flickering light, I began to talk of our future—of our marriage, of the quiet home, far from the atmosphere of the city's crimes, where we would live when our fates were joined in one. “To-morrow is Saturday. Your brother's pardon will arrive. I will place him in good hands, afar from the temptations and vices of New-York—and then, Eugenia, your brother, safe from all harm, we will be married.” I paused, for her gaze no longer met mine; her downcast eyes and half-averted face indicated an emotion which I could not define. “O Frank!” she said, calling me for the first time by name, “something tells me that our marriage had better not be. Think me not ungrateful! think not that I do not—love you! But our social condition is unequal. The world in which you move will say that I had married you for your wealth. And—and—” she now turned toward me her radiant eyes,— “Oh! let me be to you as sister to dearest brother!” Her words were hesitating, but the look which shone in every lineament of her face contradicted her words. “Eugenia!” I said, taking her hand, “you love me! That is enough! On Monday next you will be mine—my wife!” “Yes—yes—” she faltered “but there is at my heart a presentiment of evil for which I cannot account—” CHAPTER XXVII. She paused, and laid her hand upon her bosom, and in that moment—was it a dream, an omen?—a shadow flung by the dark wing of an overshadowing fate? In that moment, between me and Eugenia, there came, or seemed to come, the image of my hag-wife, hideous and scowling, followed by Eva, beautiful as ever but with sadness and reproach in her eyes. It was for a moment only. It was as palpable and vivid as an object brought out from intense darkness, for an instant, by a flash of lightning. Eugenia broke the silence, as she rose from her chair, and placed a small book, a thin volume, bound in a brown cover, in my hands. “Read this,” she said, “and then say whether it is well that one of my social condition should link her life with a man of your wealth. It is a little book, but it says a great deal.” Wondering I took the book; opened it, and glanced over its pages. It was a little book, composed of a few pages of formal manuscript, and yet it did say a great deal. There was a world of meaning in its cramped, formal pages. It was the book in which were kept the accounts of Eugenia and her employer. For a week's labor of sixteen hours a day, employed upon the finest kind of needlework, Eugenia received just two dollars and a half—so said the book. A week's labor, that taxed eye and hand, and lungs, to their utmost, repaid with twenty shillings, to speak in the dialect of New-York! And for every dollar that the embroideress received, her employer, by the sale of the production of her needle, received his ten dollars! I could not help throwing the account book on the table, with a gesture of indignation and contempt. “Behold the justice of society to its weakest and most helpless members!” I ejaculated. “For the same amount of labor, expended in any branch of mechanics or manufactures, a man would receive at least one dollar per day! But woman is weak, she is defenceless, she can be robbed with impunity!—” “Or—” Eugenia interrupted me, her eyes downcast, and her neck and face all crimson, for the moment—“Or, if she does not choose to lead this kind of life, there is yet open to her another career. That of the poor girl by whose hands Burley Hayne met his fate! But you are surprised at the record of my labors. Here is a book which will surprise you more. It is a book lent to me by a poor seamstress, who works for the proprietor of a clothing store—” and she placed the second book in my hands. Talk of black slavery! In what respect can it rival with the white slavery, a portion only of whose unutterable horrors was detailed in the cramped figures of the book which I held—a slavery which, in order to make clothing cheap, works up the heart and lungs and life of poor womanhood into garments for the nobler sex at—just sixteen pennies per day!—a slavery which does not fall upon an inferior race, abounding in rude physical life—in rude happy animal life; nor upon strong men, able to buffet and to bear misfortune, but upon women, refined, delicate women, rendered sensitive by education and religion—women, fit to be mothers, wives, sisters, daughters of the best of you, O noble, disinterested masculine sex! Unroof New-York, and in her darkest haunts you will find a thousand women fit by nature to fulfil the highest duties of woman's life, but who, by the wages-system of this great Christian city, have been consigned to that death of the soul which is a thousand fold more horrible than the death which lays the body in the coffin and the grave. “Well, Eugenia!” I said, flinging the accursed book to the floor—“it is in my heart to kneel at your feet, and in you worship the enshrined images of holy poverty and spotless virtue! You not worthy of my hand. O would to heaven I was worthy of yours!” Here let “The Man of the World” pause in his narrative for a little while, while the editor of these papers intrudes upon the reader a few thoughts suggested by the facts just stated—facts which tell of the awful contrasts presented by the Wealth and Poverty of a great city like New-York. It is a pitiful thing that, side by side with the most splendid victories won by our modern civilization over dumb matter, Poverty marches steadily on, like a skeleton at the shoulder of the voluptuous queen of some banquet-hall. Look around you! and you behold everywhere the trophies of enterprise— edifices whose majestic architecture rivals the wonders of old Rome—telegraphs that annihilate space—Ericsson inventions, that revolutionize the industrial interests of an entire age. And look before you! and there are little children, in rags and naked feet, sweeping the crossings of the streets. On one hand, the St. Nicholas Hotel and Grace Church; on the other, the Five Points. Why these contrasts? Can it be true, as gravely asserted by sleek gentlemen, with well developed physical organizations, and good accounts at bank, that no one is poor but those who deserve to be so? That success is the test of virtue; the want of it, the badge of crime? Talk like this may do for a couple of portly gentlemen, gravely engaged at beefsteak and old Port; or for some editorling, whose inquiries into life and its mysteries have never led him to a higher aspiration than a seat at the opera. But for those who see misery everywhere; see it livid, half-naked, and more horrible to look upon, because it is everywhere contrasted with enormous wealth and boundless luxury—those who, thus seeing it and confronted by it at every turn, are either hardened into callousness or wrung with perpetual anguish by the sight—the doctrine of portly gentlemen and editorling will by no means suffice. Once admit that wealth is the unfailing sign of virtue; poverty, the brand of crime, and you write “felon” on the foreheads of the noblest men, whose glorious names brighten along the pathway of ages. Nay; you put the brand of infamy upon a life whose every detail was but an exemplification, in the most unutterably touching form, of the divine gospel of self-denial; a life which made poverty holy, and failure godlike; a life which begun with the calm hymn of “Good tidings to the poor!” yet ended with that burst of unutterable anguish, “Eli! Eli! lama sabachthani!” That life was designed as a lesson, as an example, as a consolation, to all the sons of men, in and through all time; it was that holy, beautiful life—intended as an embodiment of humanity, in its deepest sorrows and loftiest yearnings, walking patiently the fire-paved track of poverty and suffering; and when you say to the poor man, “Your poverty is the result of crime;” to the unsuccessful, “Your failure is the effect of your own sins,” your brutal taunt falls not only upon the poor and unsuccessful, but upon His forehead who is the master of us all. You mock God, and in his place enthrone Mammon, that lowest of all the devils, who, while his prouder compeers stood erect, blasted but defiant, went crawling on all fours in search of pennies. “Any one who does right can get along. It's only the idle, the improvident, or the criminal, who are poor.” This, reader, is not the sentiment of a professed atheist, but of a large number of good folks, who dress well, eat well, sleep well, and rather think themselves the exact models of respectability and virtue. Let us try their doctrine a moment. If, though the rain and sleet of this drear winter night, you will look into yonder—hovel? no, but huge mansion, rising in the heart of the great city, and tenanted by at least a hundred of the most miserable of the poor—if you will cast your gaze into a particular room, lighted by a single candle, you will behold a pale woman working with her needle. A woman in suffering; but a girl, scarcely more than a child in years; eyes glaring feverishly in their hollow sockets, cheeks sunken, lips pinched and white, and the dead, blank look of misery and want on every lineament. This girl-woman, by the death of her father, a hard-working laborer, who all his life toiled late and early for rent money and bread; and, when he could work no more, died, has become the only protector and hope of the brother and sister, little children, whom you may see sleeping now upon the bed in yonder corner of the miserable room. To keep them in bread and home, the girl-woman works at her needle sixteen hours a day —works until pulse is feverish, eyes hot and dim, and lungs heavy as lead—for which she gets per day from sixteen to twenty-five pennies; from whom, we will not say, for we wish to spare the feelings of the sleek gentlemen who work up the lungs and lives of women into merchandize. Well, sixteen pennies per day is rather small capital upon which the girl-woman is to support herself, and feed and clothe her orphan brother and sister. Even the sixteen pennies will not last long, for the consumption is busy at the life of the girl-woman; in a little while there will be a grave dug for her. Now, gentle and comfortable people, who smack your lips as you say,—“Any one that is not idle and improvident can get along; the idle, the improvident, the criminal only, are poor”—will you tell us the particular sin of this girl-woman, who is now digging her grave with her needle? You can hear her grave-cough, as, for an instant, she stops in her work and looks up with her feverish eyes. The particular sin of this girl, if you please? Life has never disclosed to her any of its blossoms—nothing but its thorns. The joys of love, the name of wife, the holy wealth of motherhood can never be hers. She is dedicating herself to death, for the support of her brother and sister. Now, of what sin is she guilty? Speak out, sleek gentlemen! Was it a sin in her that her father, unable to work any longer, fell sick and died? When she is dead, the boy and girl, her brother and sister, will be cast friendless upon the world, without education or hope, the boy to end, it may be, one winter's day, in the open square within the Tombs, the rope about his neck and the gibbit over his head; the girl to come at last to a death-bed by which will sit no comforters but dishonor and shame. Now, will you, complacent gentlemen, tell us what sin it is of this orphan boy and girl, that, by father and sister's death, they are cast adrift upon the world? Their poverty is the effect of their sin, you know—that is your doctrine—tell us the particular sin? But, say you, this case is exceptional, and button your pockets over your well filled purses. Exceptional! O most convenient loop-hole! through which you can creep to escape the consequences of your infernal dogma. This case is not exceptional. It is the case, in some shape or other, of one-half at least of the large city's poor—poor, who are poor through no fault of theirs, but who work straight on for bread as long as life's daylight holds out. At the worst, scarcely one-fourth of the poor are poor from their own fault. Bring out your statistics; lift the veil which hides the secrets of society; and you will find this to be a truth, hard even for you to get over. But, taking the other side of your dogma, by which you all, complacent gentlemen, tell us, in effect, if not in so many words—that wealth is the sign of a virtuous life, spent in honest effort— you will allow us to pause a moment, while we endeavor to believe that you are not in earnest—that this dogma is only a joke of yours, a very brutal joke, yet still intended for a joke. Wealth always, or in one case out of three, the symbol of a virtuous life spent in honest effort! Horrible mockery! Where is the man who dares trace to their real source five out of ten of the great fortunes of this metropolis? The man does not live who dares do it. And if such a man did live, his disclosures, or rather his analysis, would cause him to be hunted forth like a wild beast from the pale of city civilization. CHAPTER XXVIII. On Saturday morning I went into the tombs,—that stone nightmare which squats upon the breast of New-York, surrounded by the atmosphere of moral pestilence. Ascending the steps, and passing through those gloomy pillars, whose very shadows seem to be imbued with memories of violence and bloodshed, I soon found myself in the court-room, where the obscurity of a cloudy day was relieved by gas-light. Under the domed ceiling, were lawyers, witnesses, judges, jurymen and criminals—a vivid and heterogeneous picture. From yonder door, criminals emerge from their cells to receive the sentence due their crimes; and through yonder door, once sentenced, they pass again, to linger a little while in the Tombs, ere they are consigned to the living death of the State Prison. That court of sessions' room is a theatre; every one who appears there, whether as lawyer, witness, juryman, judge, or criminal, is an actor; the only essential difference between it and the Park or Bowery, is, that when the actors have played their parts under this domed ceiling, some of them retire through yonder door to be consigned to the moral death of the State Prison, or to the more merciful death inflicted by the gallows. The judge, supported by two aldermen, was on the bench; and, before him, in the centre of the scene, a criminal stood up to receive his sentence. The judge was a pleasant, mild-faced man, who had become so accustomed to sentencing criminals, that he did it very much in the same manner that a tired clerk at Stewart's disposes of a dress pattern to a very troublesome and homely woman. And, contrasted with the round, pleasant face of the judge, was the sharp, nervous visage of the criminal—a swarthy boy of eighteen, whose matted hair fell over his forehead, while his small glittering eyes wandered in defiance over the crowded court. It was John Smith, otherwise known as Edward Cloud, the brother of Eugenia. The judge expected his pardon from the governor in the afternoon, but proceeded to sentence the prisoner as though there was no thought of pardon in the case. As for myself, I had thought it best not to communicate one word concerning the anticipated pardon to the unfortunate boy. Eugenia had not seen him since the day when, from a paragraph in a daily paper, she had been led to believe that the young burglar and her missing brother was the same person,—when she had gone to the Tombs, crossed the dreary prison yard, ascended to cell “No. —,” and took the wretched outcast to her arms. And but a few hours before, I had left Engenia in her modest home, and came alone to the Tombs, to hear the law's last judgment upon her brother. Well! there was a buzzing noise all over the room, as the young culprit stood up to hear his sentence; then the sharp voice and sharper knuckles of an officer commanding “Silence!” and then you might have heard a pin drop. As the judge began to read the sentence from a written paper, the young burglar glanced about the court with an earnest and softened gaze, glanced over every face and peered into every corner, and for a moment his face quivered and his lips trembled. He was looking for Eugenia! And when the consciousness came upon him that her face was not there,—that there was not one face there to look upon him with pity and with love,—the softened look passed from his countenance; he was sullen, defiant, almost brutal again. He drew his rough overcoat closer over his chest, clenched his right hand, and faced the judge with an unfaltering gaze. The remarks with which the judge prefaced the sentence were of the usual character,—well meant, without doubt, but calculated to make the sides of a devil ache with laughter, that is, if devils ever laugh when the humbug of this world is paraded before their eyes. “Great wrong committed on society, —shocking depravity in one so young,— have time to reflect upon your crime, and atone for it within the walls of the State Prison;” such were some of the prominent heads of the judge's brief sermon. He did not say a word about any duty which society owed to the miserable outcast; did not breathe a whisper in regard to the depraved father who had left his boy to try the hard battle of the world, friendless and alone; not the shadow of a whisper concerning those bitter years of ragged, half-naked, hungry, tempted childhood, which the boy had endured in the great city. O no! such things never come within the knowledge of the law. It is simply the business of the law to imprison and to kill. The judge concluded his homily with this brilliant and startling thought— “John Smith, it is the sentence of the court that you be imprisoned for the term of three years at Sing-Sing.” To which John replied, with a look which showed that State Prison discipline would do about as much to reform his soul as a course of sawdust and brickbats would to fatten his body. He was then taken out; the door closed after him; the court buzzed again; again an officer cried and rapped, “Order!” and the judge proceeded to the dispatch of other business. That afternoon the pardon came, signed by the noble-hearted governor, and Eugenia and myself went to the Tombs, and brought the young convict from his gloomy cell into free daylight. No one who had seen his hard, callous face in the morning, would have imagined him to be the same boy. We took him to Eugenia's home, where he sat on the edge of a chair, his nether lip quivering, and his eye roving about the room, as if he was not altogether certain that he was awake. “I thought you'd forget me—I did;” —he faltered, as he looked into the face of Eugenia—“I did. Are you, really, my sister? No you aint—you aint! You the sister of a cuss like me?” He turned his face away from the light, toward the wall, and leaning over the back of the chair, “wept bitterly”—perhaps the first tears he shed since he wandered from his New-England birthplace. At this moment, Col. Eliphalet Cloud (whose consent, by the by, I had obtained the day before to the anticipated marriage) came into the room, prim and cadaverous, and “dressed to the death.” He gazed at the sobbing convict through his eye-glass. “This is you, is it? What a bad boy you've been! A very—very bad boy! You must have kept shockingly low company! You young villain, I'm ashamed of you!” To which the boy, raising his face, down which the tears were freely coursing, made reply, as he gazed at the fossil specimen of the man of the world before him—“Get out! Who the — are you! What are you gassin' at me fur?” It was an odd picture—the ragged convict son, and the genteel scoundrel father. Eugenia came between them, and led the old gentleman into the back room. On the next Monday we were married. There were no guests at our wedding— only Eugenia, myself, and the clergyman, (the same who had officiated at the marriage of Louis and Evelina,) were present. In the same parlor where I had first met Eugenia, she placed her hand in mine, and called me “husband!” As for the good old man, her father, (whose virtues were only surpassed by those of my own departed parent,) I had placed him in an establishment of his own, where he could drink and gamble to his heart's content. The boy, in whom traces of a better nature were apparent, I had sent far into the country, to the house of a good clergyman, where he might retrieve the errors of his youth, in preparation for a bright and useful manhood. Happy days now in the grave city mansion! No thought of hag-wife now —only a softened and touching memory of Eva! The place was musical now with the voice of Eugenia, and the long-deserted rooms imbued with the glory of her presence and her beauty. Happy days! Few women have walked this earth combining the same qualities as Eugenia—now, the tenderest child in her emotions; and now, the proud, queenly, intellectual woman. And yet, Why was it that oftentimes, in the very moment when her face was all radiant with life and loveliness, a cloud would come upon it, for an instant only, but the sadder to behold from its contrast with her previous joyousness? Do you see yonder old mansion that stands upon the heights above the Hudson, bearing traces of the cannon-shot of the Revolution on its walls of dark gray stone—a massive edifice, centred in a garden, its steep roof overhung by the boughs of encircling oaks? Between the garden and the Hudson there is a steep cliff—a broken link of the Palisades — and, standing in the garden walk, by that huge old oak, which has faced the winter of three centuries, the broad Hudson, the roof and steeples of New-York, the Sound, the Heights of Brooklyn, and the glorious Manhattan Bay, all lie stretched before you, distinct as the lines of a map, and as beautiful as any picture every lighted up by a summer morning sun. The mansion itself is very massive and gloomy, with wings projecting to the north and south; and within its sombre walls are many rooms, all bearing the same appearance of stately grandeur which they wore in the Revolution— rooms which, it is said, long ago were the theatres of crimes which never found a record in the books of courts of law. There is a hearthstone there yet red with the stain of a tragedy enacted seventy years ago. Well, this house I purchased, and, as May came, led Eugenia across its threshhold. It was a bright, beautiful day; May rippled over the river's surface, and scattered her blossoms among the trees. I was the happiest man alive, and as for Eugenia, never had she looked so surpassingly beautiful. We crossed the threshold. No omen scared us back. And yet the most terrible event of both our lives was to happen within those walls. I can see Eugenia yet, as she lingered for a moment on the threshold her face and form framed in the dark doorway; the form robed in white, with a shawl of many colors falling aside from her noble bust; the face set in the shadow of her rich black hair. Her bonnet had fallen to her shoulders, her hand was lifted to her brow, as she looked forth upon the spring sunshine, the river, the city and the bay. Very beautiful! Who, in this queenly woman, now pausing on the threshold of the house which, (with its lands,) I had purchased for her in her own name, would have recognized the poor seamstress of New-York? “Oh, is not the day beautiful, Frank?” she cried, in the very fullness of her joy. “Beautiful, Eugenia!” And, all unconscious of the dark future, we went over the threshold into the gloomy house. CHAPTER XXIX. We lived in the old mansion, afar from the world, and untroubled by the laborious amusements of what is called fashionable life, and I was happy once more, and I lived again; the black memories of the past grew dim and dimmer. May expanded into summer, autumn passed, winter shone calm and cold from clear skies through the boughs of leafless trees. “Spring was near again, and Eugenia was crowned with the holy name of mother!” A new face bloomed in blessing on our home. O the calm, untroubled peace of those days! One evening in early June, as I was returning alone from New-York to my country mansion, the carriage broke down on the high road, not more than a mile from home. I left it in charge of the coachman, and walked homeward. It was one of those mild, beautiful evenings, enriched by the light of the rising moon, and fragrant with the breath of young summer, which you never forget. As I entered the gate, and took the winding path which led through the grounds to the old house, there was a paly stillness in the air. Grand and majestic rose the old trees around me, their leaves moving with the faintest motion; now and then a turn of the path gave me a glimpse of the Hudson, rippling in the moonlight, and of the distant city, which slept, or seemed to sleep, in the smile of the calm, hallowed night. Walking quietly on, every sense lulled by the sacred influence of the hour, I was thinking of my past and of my present life, and thanking God most fervently that the darkness of the past was dim in my memory, while the joy of my present was upon me, vivid and all-absorbing, like a gush of sunshine through an open window in the better world. Thus I drew near my home, and came into the garden, which encircled the gray old walls with a drapery of foliage, vines and blossoms. There was a window, which served the purposes of window and door, and opened on the garden from the sitting-room of Eugenia. It was framed in a flowering vine. Instead of approaching the hall-door, I drew near this window, determining to enter by it, and surprise Eugenia. The sash was raised; the light from the room came cheerfully forth, mingling with the rays of the moon. Concealing myself among the vines, I looked within. In a fine old room, with paneled walls and arched fireplace, sat Eugenia, reading by a candle which stood on a workstand near her, while her babe was sleeping in a cradle at her feet. She was attired in a flowing white robe, and her dark hair was disposed in glossy masses about her face. Serene and pure, she sat there in her quiet room, a soft glow on her cheek, her eyes half veiled by the downcast lashes—the very impersonation of all that is noble in woman, wife and mother. While I stood silently contemplating this picture, a door opened, and, to my unfeigned surprise, a man whose face I had never seen before entered the room. A man of some twenty-seven years, with a pale, haggard face, dark hair that hung in tangled and uneven locks, and large glittering eyes. His dress was faded and worn, and he looked very much like a man who had seen much misfortune, poverty, and, perchance, crime. He approached Eugenia silently, and stood near her, unperceived, gazing upon her with a look in which hatred seemed to struggle with other emotions. Was his object robbery? I stood spell-bound, yet prepared to rush upon him the moment he showed signs of violence. Fortunately, I was armed; by some chance or other, I carried a revolving pistol in the breast of my dress-coat. I drew it silently forth, and covered the intruder with a deliberate aim. It may be imagined that I awaited the issue of this scene in keen suspense. Still, Eugenia, reading, had not raised her eyes or perceived the presence of the stranger. He drew a step nearer, stealthily, noiselessly, and reached forth his hand. Then, in a low voice, broken by a strong effort to restrain some deep emotion, he spoke. I heard every word. “Well, Eugenia! It is about three years since last we met, or rather since we parted. She raised her eyes, and for the first time beheld him. All color fled from her face. She sat on the sofa as though suddenly paralyzed. Then rising to her feet, pale and trembling, her lips bleached, and the hands which she extended quivering as with a spasm, she faltered forth the words,—“Albert! Albert! O my God, is it you!” And the next moment she was in his arms, sobbing on his breast; and he, the dark expression gone from his face, pressed his kiss upon her forehead with impassioned rapture. I staggered back from the window as though my reason had been bewildered by a violent blow. I wandered, I know not why, down the garden toward the cliff which overhung the river shore. The moon was shining brightly; the river stretched along there, calm and beautiful in the soft light; nature all around me was still, but the agonies of the damned were tearing at my heart-strings, On the edge of the cliff, I leaned against a tree, and pressed my hands to my forehead in the effort to collect my shattered senses. As I looked back upon the events of that fearful night, I can remember distinctly that, after standing for a moment on the verge of the cliff, I went up the garden-walk, toward the house, the pistol in my hand; that I trembled from head to foot; that the ground seemed to rock beneath my tread, but that my eye was clear, my hand firm; that, as I reached the porch in front of my mansion, a man came forth, passing from the shadow into the light of the moon, until he stood face to face with me. I can remember how there was a glow as of triumph on his pale face, and how he met my gaze with a look all defiance and insolence. I can remember that I called him by his first name— the name which had trembled from the lips of my wife—that I told him to look his last upon the river and sky; for, as there was a God above us, he must die. I can remember the look he gave as he staggered back from the leveled pistol; how he cried, “Hold! I have never harmed you!”—and how I drove him before me, step by step, until he was against one of the pillars of the porch, and there I made an end of the scene, and fired. He fell forward on his face, bathed in blood. I can remember a shriek, and a hurried step, and the form of a woman bending over the dying man, until her white dress was spotted with his blood. After this, all memory is a dead blank, only broken by dreams that might change heaven itself into hell. CHAPTER XXX. From the moment when in clear moonlight I saw a woman's form bending over the dying man, until her white robes were stained with blood, a vague shadow stretches over my life—a vague and awful shadow, broken only now and then by gleams of light that resemble a flash of lightning, the crater of an extinct volcano. What a strange, horrible existence became mine! My individuality was lost. I was a king, an emperor, a savage beast, a tree blasted in the midst of a blooming garden; I was my hag-wife, and Eva, any thing, every thing, but myself. I knew not where I was, whether in this world or the next, whether in a palace or a prison; I only lived in my dreams, and the last dream that possessed me, more vivid than any reality I had ever encountered, clothed and surrounded me with its own peculiar associations. As long as that dream lasted I lived in it, and in it only; when it passed, another took its place. Such dreams never before harrowed an immortal soul! I was buried alive; they had nailed down the coffin-lid; they had locked the door of the vault and left me there; I was living in my coffin, and it was my judgment that I could not die. Gnashing my teeth and tearing my flesh in my efforts to burst the coffin-lid, I still had no power to kill myself. Then, I had committed the unpardonable sin, and was exiled to some distant corner of the universe, where neither man, nor angel, nor devil—not even one ray of God's presence—could visit me, for I was an outlaw from heaven, earth, and hell. I was the only occupant of a blasted planet, whose volcanic mountains arose into a copper-colored sky. There was no sun, nor moon, nor tree, nor flower, nothing but mountains of a leaden color, lighted by smouldering volcanoes, and towering away, away, and away, until their peaks were lost in a copper-colored sky. Then I was a spirit returned to earth again, and forced to occupy the body of some inferior animal; beaten, starved, overworked, always endeavoring to speak and tell the human faces round me that I was not a beast, but an immortal soul, and always finding my utterance dying away in a brutal howl. This passed, and another dream came. From the beast I glided into the emperor. I was Napoleon amid the snows and cannon-smoke of Austerlitz or by the glare of the burning Kremlin, or on the rock of St. Helena. The blood I shed could not be measured; the corpses I laid around me, wherever I went, made all the earth white with the livid faces. I was happy in carnage, and pursued murder as a lover his mistress. From Napoleon on his throne I was suddenly transformed into my hag-wife, suspended by the cord, always struggling, choking, strangling, and never dying. Then I was Eva in her coffin, with her dead baby on her breast, and saw my own self bending over the coffin and weeping there. Thus, dream succeeded dream, not like the visions of a fever, but most strangely and horribly palpable; and I had no existence of my own. Whether moments, hours or days passed, I had not the remotest consciousness. At last I seemed to awake, and looked about me with the external eye. I found myself in a small room, with the sunlight shining through the grated bars of a solitary window. I was seated on a small cot. Near my feet were cords, which had, to all appearance, but lately bound my wrists and ankles. I was clad in a jacket and trowsers of coarse cotton. “Madhouse or jail?” I muttered, and seemed to hear my own voice for the first time since the night of the murder. I arose and went to the window. A summer sun, near its setting, shone over a garden, a prospect of woods, and fields, and a distant city, from a calm, clear sky. O how that calm, happy view, so full of the spirit of peace, contrasted with my late dreams! Turning from the window, I looked around my cell. The grated door had, by some chance, been left open. I passed through the doorway, and found myself in a long, dimly-lighted and silent corridor. Without a definite object I wandered along this corridor until I came to a point where it connected with another. Here, from an opened door, a gleam of light shone out on the dark passage. I pushed the door wide open, entered, and found myself in a well-furnished apartment, with an elegant bed, chairs, table overspread with books and papers; evidently the apartment of some official connected with the place. A mahogany wardrobe stood between the bed and the window. This I opened, and as quietly as though the event was a matter of course, proceeded to exchange my coarse cotton garments for a suit of black cloth, which happened to fit me, and which I found in the wardrobe. A pair of boots stood near the table, a hat and white cravat stood upon it; these, in a moment, I assumed. I could not tell how the dress became me, for there was no mirror in the room, but after carefully surveying myself, I sallied forth, resolved to entrust my adventures to fate or chance. I plunged into the second corridor, dimly lighted like the other, and walked on (the doors of cells on either hand) until I came to a large grated door, which stretched across the passage. Beyond this an official waited, silent and demure as a statue. He unbolted the door without a word, and suffered me to pass, evidently taking me for the person whose dress I had assumed. “This is better than my dreams, any how!” I muttered, and hurried on. I soon came to a second door, beyond whose bars I saw a passage all light and sunshine. The second official, like the first, suffered me to pass without a word. The passage into which I now entered resembled the ward of a hospital—the ward for convalescents—only that it was lighter and more cheerful. Numerous windows on either hand gave entrance to the rays of the declining sun, and opened to the gaze a pleasant prospect of fields and gardens, and a distant village or city. Up and down this passage walked, perchance, fifty men, of all ages, and mostly well-dressed—up and down, with a quick, nervous motion, and with a perpetual fire in their restless eyes. These did not resemble convicts so much as the better class of patients of an—insane hospital. Raising my kerchief to my face, I passed rapidly through their various groups, and soon came to the door at the other extremity of the passage. The third official, like the others, let me pass without a word. I traversed a wide hall, descended a broad stairway; and, through a lofty door, emerged into open sunshine. Still keeping the handkerchief to my face, I hurried down a broad garden walk, toward the porter's lodge, which I saw in the distance. Half-way down, I encountered a party, composed of ladies and gentlemen, who had evidently been visiting the place, for they were chatting pleasantly about the various forms of insanity which they had beheld. As I came up, I heard my own name. O how like a word from another language it sounded! “Yes, he is there,” said another voice, “but the public are never admitted to the ward in which he is confined. They only keep the most hopeless and desperate there!” Passing the kerchief rapidly over my face. I passed through the group, and heard the whisper as I passed—“That is Doctor N—, one of the most successful in the treatment of hopeless cases.” I approached the porter's lodge, and now, for the first time, my heart began to beat with anxiety. Would the porter detect the cheat? The sight of sun, of trees, of flowers, the free atmosphere which filled my lungs, all conspired to fill me with new energy, and I hurried on with a rapid step. The porter, a middle-aged man, rose from his chair, approached the gate, looked at me languidly, and—let me pass! I was free! I did not cast a single backward look upon the massive pile which had lately imprisoned me, but, turning my face to the village or city, hurried on. A train of cars stood waiting by a depot. Passing rapidly through the crowd upon the platform, I entered the first car that offered, and flung myself on a seat in a dark corner. In a moment the train was whirling away, and I saw the roofs of the Asylum shine in the sun, far behind me, just before they were hidden by a grove of trees. And drawing my hat low over my brows, I gave myself up to a joy too deep for words, as I contemplated my strange escape. Not once perchance in a million times could such an attempt have proved successful. The circumstances which favored my escape, (as I afterwards learned,) were these: Dr. N— has a man about my height, very taciturn, and nearly always seen with an essenced kerchief lifted to his face. On the day of my escape, he had found me in a profound sleep, which had succeeded a terrible paroxysm, and been summoned from my cell to a call not far away, where his services were more immediately demanded. While he was in this cell—an hour or more—my escape had been consummated. And now I was free! But was there no danger of detection in the cars? The conductor came along to collect the fares—I felt my heart jump to my throat. What could I do without money? I, not long ago the owner of half a million of dollars, now without even a dollar to pay my railroad fare. I put my hand into the pocket of the black vest which I wore, and drew forth a pocket-book. To my inexpressible joy it contained some gold and bank-bills— about fifty dollars. I paid my fare, and, sinking back into my seat, I fell into a pleasant slumber, unbroken by a dream. When I awoke the cars were in Albany. I called a coach and directed the coachman to drive to the — Hotel, the best in the place, where, entering my name as “Caleb Jenkins,” I at once hurried to my room, which was an elegant parlor, with a bed in an alcove. I directed the servant to bring light and a newspaper, which he did at once, and then I found myself alone. I had not yet looked into a mirror, and I was afraid to do it, afraid that some great change had passed over my face, which it would appall me to behold. I was afraid to look upon the newspaper; afraid, I could not tell why; I knew that I had not been confined in the Asylum for a year, and yet I was afraid that the date of the paper would inform me that I had been imprisoned many years. At last, I rose, and took the light, and looked into the mirror. “O my God!” was the exclamation which was forced from my lips. Changed, indeed! On that fatal night I had been a young man; the face in the mirror, colorless and wrinkled with great hollows underneath the eyes, was that of a man of middle age. My hair was cut close; it was thick with gray hairs. My beard, which seemed the growth of about three days, was also sprinkled with gray hairs. How many years had passed since that accursed night when I laid the destroyer of my peace at my feet in his blood? Had I been tried for the crime? Transferred from the convict's to the madman's cell? I seized the newspaper, and you may be sure that my hands trembled as I held it to the light. The fatal night had occurred in the year 1842—the date of the paper before me was June 10th, 1847. CHAPTER XXXI. Five years of my life a blank—a chaos! I sank back into my chair, and for a few moments surrendered myself to all the bitterness of my agony. And Eugenia, what had become of her? My wealth and estates, in whose hands were they? I paced the floor with clasped hands, and it was some time before I could recover my presence of mind. “But,” I said aloud, “we must not go mad again. We have had enough of that. Doubtless, my good wife, after betraying me, consigned me to a madhouse, and then, procuring a divorce with the wealth of the insane husband, married again. A-h!”—I could not help grating my teeth—“we have need of all our presence of mind, for we have a hard battle to fight.” I summoned the servant, and directed him to bring me a barber, and in a few moments that odious dark beard, streaked with gray, was removed from my face. Then, as I was faint from want of nourishment, I ordered a substantial supper in my room, and ate heartily, and drank a glass of undoubted champagne—yes, a bottle of the amber liquid, topped with its snowy foam. “Yes, in any case, I will leave this country forever,” I soliloquized, raising the glass to my lips. “I may find Eugenia dead, but it is more probable that I will find her married again, and in possession of all my wealth. Let her have it! There is a curse upon it! It came from my hag-wife, and will carry a curse wherever it goes. But, in any case, I must see Eugenia before I leave the country.” I directed the servant to call me in time for the boat, which left at daybreak for New-York, and soon was enjoying a pleasant and dreamless sleep. By daybreak next morning I was on board of a North River boat to New-York. To New-York! What adventures would I encounter there? Secluded in my stateroom, I reviewed my past life, and endeavored to lift the veil which covered five years of it with impenetrable mystery. Had I been tried for the murder? Was there not in my mind a dim, awful memory, vague as a half-obliterated daguerreotype, of a thronged court, myself in the criminal's place, Eugenia on the witness-stand—of a verdict of guilty and a sentence of death for the crime of deliberate murder? Was this vague impression only the wreck of a memory, or the mere figment of an idle dream? If, sentenced for murder, had I, in consequence of insanity, been transferred from the condemned cell to the madhouse? What had become of my houses and lands? of my immense wealth? of—Eugenia? I bowed my head in very bitterness of soul,—“Ah! untrue to her husband, whom she had driven to madness and murder, Eugenia has obtained a divorce and married again! My property has been divided between her new husband and my own greedy relatives. I am like one risen from the grave,—alone, utterly alone,—without a soul to love or care for me in the wide world.” There was one thought which cut the deepest—my child! O my child! blood of my innermost life; soul of my soul! what had become of my child? I hurried from my room and paced the deck. How like an old friend, always trusted, and never faithless, the Hudson spread his generous old face before me, bright with the morning sun! And the mountains yonder, stretching away into the western heaven, seemed to bend their pine-clad tops to greet me —I knew them—old memories filled my heart at the sight, and tears came to my eyes. Down the Hudson we glided under that calm summer sky, until the highlands, grand and mysterious with revolutionary memories, were passed, and broad Tappan Bay lay before us, like a 6 mirror framed in hills of emerald and gold. And then my gaze roved nervously to the southwest. My home, the gloomy old mansion on the heights, was there; there the garden, in which, by the light of the summer moon, I had seen the livid face of the dying man; soon it would be in sight. Pacing the deck with short rapid steps I watched for the first glimpse of it with an intensity that was agony itself. At last it came in sight, the son shining on its steep roofs and embowering trees. Straining my eyes I sought to pierce the shadows of those trees, to look into the old house and see the faces that now gazed upon the gloomy paneled rooms; and of all rooms that in which Eugenia sat on the night of the murder. There were—yes! I could not be mistaken—there were forms moving in the garden walk, and the white dress of a woman fluttered among the trees. “Can it be Eugenia!” The words rose to my lips. The boat glided on, and soon the old mansion was out of sight. To the east I turned my gaze, searching for that home by the river shore to which the young student used to come in the still dusk to meet that woman who was a child in her experience, an angel in her love. And presently it came in sight —a glimpse of it only—through the thickly clustered foliage. The sight unmanned me. I sank into a seat, and hid my face in my hands, until it was lost to view. We arrived in New-York in the afternoon. The bustle, the uproar, the tramp of ten times ten thousand feet, the sea of faces, always hurrying by, all startled me like the wonders of some fantastic dream. New-York was to me as much of a miracle of mad, impetuous life, as though I had never trod its streets before. Five years I had passed in a living grave; and now, confronted with the ever-changing panorama of New-York life, I could scarce believe the evidence of my eyes and ears. Entering my name at a retired hotel in Courtland-street, I took a carriage, and directed the driver to proceed to a certain place some miles out of town—in a word, the home of Eva. It was near sunset when the carriage halted in the by-road, near the wood, and in sight of the river. How eagerly I darted into the wood and followed the path which led to Eva's home! I was faint with excess of emotion as I reached the garden gate. Yes! it was the same place; true, the garden was overgrown with weeds; the house, now bathed in the sunshine, was falling to decay, but it was still the place in which I had loved Eva; in which her child had blossomed into life; in which mother and child had been hurried down to death. I sprang through the gate, threaded my way among the weeds, and soon stood at the door, which evidently had not been opened for a long time. I knocked—a hollow echo— but no sound of footstep or voice. What had become of the good-hearted Irish woman whom I had left in charge of the place at the time of my marriage with Eugenia? Who was now the owner of Eva's home? These questions rose to my lips, but there was no answer to them. Flinging my weight against the door, I burst it open, and hurried from the cheerful sunshine into the damp, close passage. Then, up stairs into the room which was once mine, and which was next to Eva's. Through the broken blinds and torn window curtain, a gleam of sunshine trembled in, and quivered (from the motion of the leaves before the window) upon the picture of the Virgin Mary on the wall. There was my table, the very chair on which I had slept on the night when Eva in the next room was writhing in the grasp of murder—table and books and chair were thick with dust, but the room was still the same. I opened the door which led into the next room—Eva's room—you may be sure that my hand trembled. The room was dark, but as I opened the door a belt of sunshine streamed into it, disclosing its details, and—yes! lighting up the bed in which Eva had slept. Every detail of the room was the same as on the night when Eva died. There was the fireplace in which the taper had stood, flinging its faint ray over the cheek of the sleeping mother and her new-born child; there was the glass which had so often reflected her joyous face; there the coverlet which had pressed her form, the pillow over which her hair had wandered in wavy masses. Silent, silent, desolate now! Is it a wonder that when the sunlight lit up this darkened room that the past came back upon me vivid, overwhelming! Risen suddenly from a living death, I found myself brought face to face with the holiest memories of my life. There was no eye to look upon me. Why not let my heart take its free course? my agony find relief in tears? I staggered forward. I knelt by the bed, kissing the pillow upon which Eva's cheek had rested. “O my God! O my God!”—the words wrung from my heart —sounded strangely in that silent chamber. And then from my lips trembled the name of Him who, in his own person, drank the last drop in the cup of human anguish, and was oftentime, in his awful loneliness—for his sorrow had no one to understand it—cheered by the kind faces and low voices of holy women. His name trembled on my lips, in itself a prayer. I rose—one glance around the place— one glance into my own room, where oftentime Eva had sat beside me—and I hurried down stairs and from the house, compressing my lip and hiding my eyes with my hand. Oh! beautiful upon the ruined house, upon the garden whose flowers struggled among weeds, upon the river seen in glimpses through the foliage—Oh! holy, and calm and beautiful, upon roof and flower and river, streamed the last rays of the setting sun. And the peach-tree rose in the garden, thick blossoms on every bough, as in the old time it rose; its blossoms now and then, like fragrant snow, tossed by the summer wind into the air. One last look upon the garden and house, and then I turned my back upon the place, a sad, friendless, blasted man. It was quite dark when the carriage into the city. As the glare of the lamps flashed through the window into my face, a new rose in my mind. Well, I knew, many incidents which I had remark my way through life, how easy it for covetous relatives to imprison a man in a madhouse. “Those who have divided my property will pursue me, and thrust me once more into a madman's cell. There they will keep me, until again I am mad indeed. Or, I shall be arrested for murder. I must lose no time—not a moment. I must put the ocean between me and this accursed city. But first, at all hazards, I will see Eugenia.” Descending from the carriage, I dismissed the driver, and bent my steps in the direction of my “grand city mansion.” You may take it for granted that my heart beat quicker as I came in sight of those lofty walls—of those familiar windows now lighted from sidewalk to roof. The owner of half a million dollars standing friendless and a beggar in front of his own palace! It was an incident for those who delight in strong contrasts. Ascending the steps, I rang the bell. A liveried servant appeared, and regarded me with a mixed look, one-fourth curiosity and three-fourths impudence. “Well, sur?” “I wish to see Mrs. Van Warner.” “She doesn't live here. An' I don't know where she does live. This is Mr. Morton's house.” And this was all the satisfaction I could obtain from the gentleman in lace and velvet. He closed the door, and I went sadly down the steps. My own house was, without a doubt, the property of another man. “The old house in the country!” I cried, “I must go there to-night—to-night, as I am a living man.” I was resolved, and lost no time in putting my purpose into execution. Crossing to Jersey City, I procured a coach with little delay, and bade the coachman drive to a certain point on the high road, near my country seat. In less than two hours he set me down near the gate, from which the winding-path led to the old house. I paid him his fare, (which reduced my fortune to ten dollars and some odd change,) and having waited until the carriage was out of sight, opened the gate, and took the path through the wood. There was no moon, the night was still, and bathed in calm star-light. I hurried on, trying to banish thought, and choke down the fast-gathering memories, as my footsteps led me near and nearer to the fatal house. Through the old trees, under the wide branching boughs, as on the night of the murder, I hurried on, until the old mansion came in sight. The garden, the broad walk, and the porch by which the dying man had writhed in his last spasm, all were before me in the calm star-light. I paused for a moment, and leaned against a tree, in the effort to suppress or to command my emotions. From Eugenia's room, on the ground floor—yes! from the window, half canopied by vines—the ray of a fireside lamp trembled out upon the garden, and described a belt of light upon the foliage. Treading on tiptoe, I approached the window, and looked within. The lamp stood on the workstand, as on the fatal night and in its light the room, dark paneled walls, sofa, chairs, fireplace, all appeared the same. And a woman dressed in white was seated on the sofa; I could not see her face, for it was averted, but her hair was dark—dark as Eugenia's—was it indeed her? My heart rose to my throat at the thought; and, without a moment's pause, I glided beneath the lifted sash and entered the room. In the centre, half-way between the window and sofa, I paused, trembling in every nerve; the woman heard my step and turned her face to me. It was not Eugenia's. She started to her feet and regarded me with a look of surprise and fear. “Whom do you wish to see, sir?” “Pardon me,” I hesitated, “but I thought—” I heard the sound of a door opening behind me and of a light footstep. Why at the sound of that light footstep did the blood rush in a torrent to my heart? Slowly I turned. The intruder was a child, a beautiful girl of some five or six years, with black ringlets floating on her shoulders, and large dreamy eyes that seemed to look at once into your soul; a very beautiful child, who raised her large eyes to me, with a look in which love seemed to struggle with awe, who made a step forward as if about to spring into my arms and then shrunk back again; a child upon whose sinless face there was the stamp of my own features, mingled with the rich loveliness of Eugenia's face. “Come here, Mary!” I said, in a low voice, and knelt and gathered the dear child to my arms. She rested there in my bosom, trembling but pleased; and, as I kissed her, she said,—“You look like papa's picture, but you are older.” Her infantile voice was interrupted by a second footstep. I looked up and beheld Eugenia. Yes, Eugenia stood before me, dressed in white, and beautiful as ever, save that her form was more rounded and flowing in its outlines, and that the rich maturity of summer had succeeded the spring bloom of her cheeks; beautiful as ever, her dark hair disposed in thick masses about her face, and her eyes glittering with unchanging light. She was entering the room, when she beheld a stranger, whose face was hidden from view, gathering her child to his bosom. I raised my face. She saw me, and, pale as death, stood transfixed to the floor. I said not a word, but gazed upon her steadily. Then her bosom heaved, a burning blush crimsoned her throat, her cheek and brow. She moved her lips, but no sound was heard. She stretched forth her hands and came towards me. “Back, polluted woman!” I cried. “This child is mine; but, as for you, I know you not! Back!” The room swam around me, and I fell, like one dead, upon my face, near the feet of my wife. CHAPTER XXXII. Overcome by long-continued excitement, I had fallen in a fainting fit at the feet of my wife. The next sensation that I can remember was that of profound calmness and repose. When I unclosed my eyes, they were saluted by the cheerful beams of the summer morning sun, stealing through the half-drawn curtains of my bed. The breath of flowers imbued and filled the air. Gazing through the curtains of my bed, I beheld the details of a luxuriously furnished room; the windows were shaded by vines and flowers, trembling on the outside to every breath of air; a vase of freshly gathered flowers stood on an ebony table near the bed; on another table the massive family Bible, in which was recorded my marriage with Eugenia; and directly opposite me, from the wall, smiled a picture which I had purchased, because it looked like Eva— the same room to which I had led Eugenia when we first entered the gloomy mansion. Raising myself on my pillow, I turned my head on my shoulder, and through the open window beheld the vines and flowers, and the broad Hudson glittering in the morning sun. It was indeed a beautiful morning, full of the peace and repose of early June. “If Eugenia were only true; if five years of my life had not been blotted out; if I was not friendless and a begger,”—thus I murmured, but did not complete the sentence. A fatal “if” stood before every hope of peace and happiness. A footstep broke the calm stillness, and I sank back upon the pillow, closing my eyes. Presently, I was conscious that a form was bending over me; that a hand was lightly pressed upon my forehead; that the soft pressure from the lips of a woman who fears to awake a beloved sleeper, was upon my lips and cheek and brow. God knows I trembled then! Could it be Eugenia, false to the husband who had made her happiness the ambition of his life—Eugenia, whose crime had consigned me to a madman's cell? I dared not unclose my eyes. Next, I heard the sound of footsteps stealthily receding from the bed, and ventured to unclose my eyes, and look around. Eugenia, dressed in a flowing morning robe, was bending over the vase of flowers, very beautiful, with her clear brown complexion set in her raven hair; but there was a look of deep sadness on her face. O how earnestly, in that momentary gaze, I devoured every detail of that noble face and form, in which the pure loveliness of the maiden, the matured beauty of the matron, seemed to mingle! and how I gnashed my teeth in very bitterness of soul, as the thought arose, —“That beautiful woman was once my wife; but, faithless to me, is now the wife of another!” And on tiptoe, like a kind nurse, afraid that the slightest movement may awake a fevered sleeper she moved through the room, seeming to shed around her an atmosphere of purity, although I knew her to be false as Satan. Why is it that, although we know a woman to be faithless as incarnate falsehood itself, yet we can never believe her to be thus when the magnetism of her presence, the clear calm light of her eyes is upon us? A light, quick, rapid step, sounded through the room, and the child came bounding to her mother's arms, her face all sunshine, and her ringlets waving in the summer air. Oh! how her simple words went to my heart! “Is pa awake?” she whispered, pointing to the bed—“Oh! I do so wish he was awake, that I might talk to him.” “Hush! He is sleeping, and you must not wake him,” whispered the mother, kissing her beautiful child; and they glided to the window and sat down there, the child cradled on the mother's knee, both very beautiful, and as like each other as the rose-bud, just trembling into life, to the rose of summer in ripe bloom. It was a beautiful picture. Stealthily, for a long time, I gazed upon that picture, until again footsteps disturbed the stillness. “We have come, madam, after our stray patient,” said a harsh voice. “Yes! after our poor, distressed relative!” added another voice, not so harsh, but soft and low, and very sneaking. “Our poor distressed relative! who, day before yesterday, escaped from the Asylum. We had some trouble to find him, but know that he is here, and will take him back with us.” I confess that these voices made the blood run cold in my veins. In one I recognized the voice of Dr. N—, the taciturn physician of the Asylum; in the other, the voice of a relative, who, in the days of my prosperity, had fawned upon me, but who, despite his sleek exterior, was as complete a scoundrel as could be found in Wall-street, or in the State Prison. Through an aperture in the bed-curtains, I stealthily surveyed them. Dr. N— stood, prim as a waxwork figure, his hat held in both hands, his form arrayed in the changeless black suit and white cravat. As for Isaiah Porgy, my relative, he was a man of singular make—very picturesque—thin legs, expansive corporation, narrow shoulders, all clad in shiny black; and all over this, placed upon a short apoplectic neck, appeared one of the most singular faces that ever frightened a portrait painter to death—narrow forehead, on either side of which straggled a lock of unpleasant-looking brown hair, faintly lined brows, small aquiline nose, huge bulging cheeks, with mouth and chin about as big as a hazle-nut, supported by a semi-circle of flesh, that possibly might be called a double chin. As for the eyes, they were so small that it is hardly worth while to mention them, were it not to record their expression of simple, unadulterated knavery. It was the mad doctor, (or doctor for the mad,) and Mr. Porgy, who now confronted my wife, that is to say, Eugenia. She rose from her chair, as she saw them, and I remarked that her face had grown very pale. Was she about to consign me once more to the madhouse? I confess that I felt that the first words she uttered would fix my fate. But she did not speak. “Now you know, madam,” said the sleek Porgy, shifting his broad-rimmed hat from one hand to the other, as though it were something hot,—“You know, madam, that since the court appointed me, as the nearest relative, one of the administrators, or trustees of the estate of the unfortunate lunatic, (you were the 'tother,) I have had a world of trouble in managing his affairs, and in keeping all things right, and—eh, eh—in fact, madam, to make a long story short, it is best for all parties to take him back at once. He is insane, you know”— “And he stole my clothes,” quaintly interrupted the taciturn doctor. Eugenia spoke; she was very pale, and I noted a tremor of her lip. “Gentlemen, do not speak so loud. My husband is sleeping. I will speak with you down stairs;” and with a quiet gesture of the hand, she pointed to the door. Could I believe my ears? “My husband!” And then that calm, proud attitude; that quietly extended hand; that beautiful face, pale as if from the force of some secret purpose, fixedly resolved upon. Was this Eugenia, my faithless wife, or the creation of a feverish dream? Mr. Porgy did not seem at all inclined to go. “But, madam,” he began, and made a step toward the bed. She quickly placed herself before him. “This is my room, sir,” she said, quietly, but with flashing eyes. “I will see you down stairs.” The doctor had already moved to the door, and Mr. Isaiah Porgy followed him, very reluctantly, stepping backward, like a man who retreats before a hot iron held near his nose by another man. They left the room, and my wife—if I can call her so—took her child by the hand and followed them. How nervously I awaited the result of the interview! how I longed for her reäppearance! An hour passed — it seemed an age—and she did not come. Through the still summer air, I heard voices in the room below—now, the monotonous voice of the doctor; now, the calm, clear voice of Eugenia, and now, the voice of Porgy, which gradually became blustering and violent. To rise, to hurry on some clothes, to hasten down stairs and confront the scoundrel, now became my prominent desire; but, in the effort to leave the bed. I sank back exhausted on the pillow. “And it could do no good,” was my bitter thought, “I am not master, only a beggar here.” At last the voices died away, and Eugenia reäppeared. She came into the room with a rapid step. She was pale and agitated, her bosom rose and fell, and one side of her face was swept by her loosened hair. There were traces of tears upon her cheeks. “No! no!—I will not consent!” I heard her whisper. “I will die first!” A sudden impulse prompted me to speak. “To what will you not consent?” I said; they were the first calm words I had addressed to her for five long years. She paused in her walk, and regarded me with a look in which surprise was only a single element. CHAPTER XXXIII. “Francis!” she said in a low voice, “are you well? are you strong? that is, well enough and strong enough to converse with me about your affairs? I had proposed to defer this conversation until you had recovered your usual strength. But, if you can converse now, it will be all the better.” I silently took her hand, but she withdrew hers; and, crossing the apartment, took some papers from the drawer of a bureau. Then she came back again, and seated herself near, on the edge of the bed. “Since you were first taken ill, this man, your relative—,” (she pointed to the name of Porgy, which appeared on the back of a paper,) “and myself have been, by the appointment of the court, joint trustees of your estate. Here is an account of my stewardship—” She placed the paper, covered with writing in her own hand, in my grasp. “As for him, he has done his best to obtain possession of your property. I have had one continued battle with him for five years. He was here this morning. He fears that you have recovered your health, and knows that, once recovered, you will call him to account. Therefore, he affects to believe that you are still— still—” she did not say insane—“still far from well, and wishes to consign you to the Asylum again. Now, here are all the papers, which show the exact position of your affairs. As soon as you can hold a pen, petition the court that you may be reinstated in possession of your property. And—” “And so,” I interrupted her, “you do not believe that I am still insane?” She regarded me earnestly with her expanded eyes. “I do not. All that you need is physical strength, and that will soon return.” I could not help laying my hand gently on her arm. “Well! suppose me reinstated into my property,—you will reinstate me in the happiness which I enjoyed five years ago?” Her gaze fell. “As soon as all is well with you,” she said, in a low voice, “I will take my child and leave you; my shadow shall not once cross your pathway—” “Then you are guilty?” I said, bitterly. “Innocent before heaven, Francis!” was her reply, given firmly, and with an unfaltering gaze. “I did not, then, on that fatal sum mer night, five years ago, see you in the arms of another man, resting on his neck, your forehead warmed by his kisses? It was all a dream, then?” “It was no dream,” and her face grew paler. “But, Francis! hear me once for all! Albert Monroe was the only son of the gentleman in whose family I found a home. He loved me, but I never loved him—in any light—save as a brother. A short time before I left my New-England home to come to New-York in search of my lost brother, Albert departed on a long voyage—to China, I believe, as supercargo of a merchantship. News came of his death—news which had every appearance of truth, and which was believed by his family and myself. And when, on that fatal night, I saw him, whom I thought long since dead, standing near me, appearing like a ghost, without a word or sound to announce his coming, it was surprise, mingled with affection for a long-lost brother, which brought me, for a moment, and a moment only, to his arms. Had you seen all, you would have seen me, as soon as I recovered my self-possession, retreat from his arms, and in answer to his reproaches about my marriage, you would have heard me command him to leave the room and the house. This, Francis! is the simple truth.” Her firm accent, her clear, unfaltering look, the expression which hung upon every line of her beautiful face, all confirmed her words. But still, there was a doubt, a latent bitterness in my heart. “And then you are not married again?” I said. She did not answer me with words, but with a look—a look which said more than words, and which I cannot describe. Her lips were, for the moment, compressed, and her eyes flashed, as though her soul was in their glance. Then she turned her face away, and a single tear rolled down the half-averted cheek, glittering there like a star. “When you are well again”—her voice was scarcely audible—“I and my child will leave you.” “That is, you will leave the murderer to the full enjoyment of his wealth and his remorse?” I said. “Murderer!” and she fixed her eyes full upon me. “Have you not heard that Albert Monroe recovered, and is now a thousand miles away, in the enjoyment of all that worldly prosperity can offer?” These words made my brain reel; a starving wretch, suddenly informed of his accession to a fortune of a million dollars, could not have been bewildered with a madder joy than now bounded through my veins. “Albert Monroe living!” I ejaculated, and sank back upon the pillow, while every fibre of my being was filled with gratitude—unutterable thankfulness to God. A cloud was lifted from my soul. Like a prisoner suddenly led forth from the dungeon in which for years not one ray of light had visited him, I felt myself blinded by the sunshine which all at once shone in upon my darkened soul. After a long pause, in a low voice I spoke,—“Freed from the remorse which haunts the murderer, and placed once more in possession of my estates, why will you leave me, Eugenia?” Her face was very beautiful, but very sad, as she answered me: “Because, Francis, there will always be a doubt, a suspicion in your innermost heart. Even while pressing me to your arms, and gazing upon the face of our child, you will be haunted by a fear which you cannot banish or control— that your wife has been false to you. You have a noble nature, Francis, but in its depths lurks one element, which, at times, poisons and overshadows your whole nature—an element which I can scarcely call by name, but which may be called doubt, fear, suspicion! It is, therefore, well—” and that something in her look which, when first I saw her, I could not analyze, now came over her face,—“It is, therefore, well that we should live apart; we will think kindly of each other, and the slightest portion of your immense wealth will suffice for me and our child. You will be happier when I am away, and when my presence no longer brings a doubt that harrows your inmost soul.” While she spoke I gazed upon her earnestly, thinking of the time when I had first met her, of the first happy year of our marriage, of the day when our child first blossomed into being; and felt my love for her roll back in a flood in all its force upon my heart. But I said calmly—as calmly as I could—“You have spoken my fate, Eugenia!”—and turned my face from the light. Not another word passed between us; after a long pause she rose, and I heard her footsteps die away. That day, I sent for an able lawyer, and, after a long interview with him, succeeded in putting measures afoot, which in a few days, spite of Porgy and all doubts, would place me once more a sane man in possession of my estates. Three days passed, and although often, while I seemed to be asleep, I felt upon my brow the pressure of Eugenia's hand, her kiss upon my lips, and felt unutterable joy at the consciousness that she was near me, still not a word passed between us. But my child often—yes! nearly always—was near me, and in my arms, loving me as though she had seen me every hour since her birth. O how like peace from God to a heart chafed by the bitterness of life—its hard experience, its broken friendships, its loves buried in treachery or death— comes the vision of the face of a sinless child. And how like bitterness from the deeps of hell comes the thought that, one day, that fair young face, lovely as those child-faces which long ago smiled in the Savior's embrace, will be hardened in every outline by the iron hand of experience, wearing on the cheek the feverish flush of this world's loves and hates, and burning in the eyes with the light of this world's passions, or the glare of its despairs! The third day I was strong again; my mind was clear, and every pulse was full of strength and life. Dressing myself in the apparel which I had worn five years before, I looked in the glass, and found that, although it was seamed with wrinkles, and crowned by dark hair streaked with gray, upon its every outline there was the calm manhood which a noble resolution imparts. I had taken my resolution, and said I to myself—“This day, as sure as the sun shines, I will fulfil it.” My lawyer came early in the morning; and, after a long interview in my chamber, departed, first, however, leaving in my hands papers which re-established me in possession of my estates. The petition of my wife, conjoined with that of Porgy, (for this good gentleman had, by my lawyer, been brought or frightened into acquiescence,) had been answered by the proper court, and I was once more myself, owner of something more than half a million of dollars. After the lawyer left, I took my hat and cane, and descended to the sitting-room of my wife, through whose opened window were seen the leaves quivering in the sunshine, and the broad Hudson glittering like molten gold. There was a lady there—the same whom I had seen the night of my return—the governess of my child. I requested her to call Eugenia, and was presently alone in that quiet room, through whose window on the fatal night, I had looked and been driven mad by what I saw. Seated on the sofa, hat and cane in hand, I anxiously awaited the appearance of Eugenia. My resolution was taken, and although it was fixed, still I felt agitated as the moment of its execution drew near. At last Eugenia came, dressed in white, her rich black hair gathered plainly aside from her face. Surpassingly beautiful, she was very pale, and looked at me with surprise in her clear deep eyes. “Sit by me for a moment, Eugenia,” I said as calmly as I could, “I wish to say a few words to you.” She sat down on the sofa near me, her hands crossed in front of her form, her eyes gazing not upon me, but on the leaves without, bathed in sunshine, and her glossy hair touched by the softened ray which came through the closed curtains. Beautiful as a queen, and trembling as a child. “I wish to say a few words to you, and I wish you to listen to me calmly. Will you?” “I will,” was her faint response. “I have discovered that, during my five years' sickness—nay, call it madness—instead of plunging into the gay world, and gathering the enjoyments offered by almost boundless wealth, you preferred to be true to the memory of a madman; and, yes! came often to sit for hours and days a silent watcher by the madman's couch. This you did, Eugenia, and never told me of it.” I paused, but her gaze was still fixed on the flowers, which, without the window, trembled in the morning sun. “Why did you not tell me of it, Eugenia, on my return?” Her voice was scarcely audible as she replied,—“It was not worth while. In taking care of your property, I simply did my duty to our child. In watching by you in your sickness, I endeavored to make some atonement for the suffering which I had caused you. And her face grew paler, her bosom heaved beneath its snowy vestment, but still she did not turn her gaze upon me. “Well,” I resumed, “well, Eugenia, the past is with the past, and cannot be recalled or changed. The present is with us, and we must deal with things as they are. It seems we cannot live together; we must part.” “We must part,” she echoed in a low voice. “But you—you—will not—take our child from me?” I did not seem to note that last remark, uttered with a quivering lip, but continued,—“We cannot live under the same roof. That is true. But it shall not be said that I only came back to thrust mother and child from these walls. No! Eugenia, no! One will go forth; and that one shall be myself; and I will go forth alone, leaving you secure in possession of my wealth, happy in the love and presence of our child!” And at the word, determined to fill my resolution at all hazards, I rose, hat and cane in hand, and moved a step toward the door. Eugenia rose with me, seized my hand with both of hers and confronted me, her eyes expanded and glittering, while her face was perfectly colorless. “Stop! For God's sake, stop!” she gasped and wrung my hand. But I took my hand from her. “Eugenia, my determination is taken. Do not try to change it. Believe it is best for all of us!” I pushed her gently aside, and, with a rapid step, moved to the window, and in a moment was in the open air. I did not once look back, but, plunging into the path which led through the wood, walked rapidly on, banishing every thought but this—“My determination is taken—it is best for all parties—and it is final.” And under the boughs, rich with foliage; over the path where sunlight and shadow chased each other; over a carpet of grass and flowers, I hurried on. There was a point where, from the foot of an aged oak, (encircled by a rude bench,) you could obtain a glimpse of the Hudson and the distant city. Here, for an instant, I paused; and, gazing on the distant waves, and upon the city's spires, sank into a reverie upon my past and future life. My reverie was broken by the abrupt rustling of a bough; by the low sound of footsteps on the velvety sward. I looked up; my wife stood before me, pale as death, her hair unbound and waving on her shoulders, while her bosom heaved with agitation. By her hand she led our child, who sprang forward, her arms outspread, and my name ringing on her lips. From her agitation, Eugenia could not speak, but stood silent and pale and trembling before me. As for myself I could not help sharing her agitation. At length, she said a single word, “Francis!” in a faint voice, and pointed to the old mansion whose roof was visible through the trees,—“that is our home!” And she bent her head upon my breast, and put her arms about my neck, while our child clung to my knees. “That is our home!” And here—in the June sunshine, the drapery of the foliage about us, as wife clings once more to husband, child to father—here let the curtain fall. You may be sure that I did not go forth alone, friendless into the wide world that day, nor next day, nor any day. Let no words attempt by description to mock the unutterable joy of that moment when trembed on my ear the sentence, “That is our home!” A few words more will bring my confessions, as “A MAN OF THE WORLD,” to a close. It is Sabbath-day, and the summer sun shines upon the distant spires of the city. But we do not go to church in the shadows of those distant spires; our church is here, in the old mansion, in our home. The sunlight trembles through the vine-canopied window into our quiet sitting-room. Eugenia, in the bloom of her matronly beauty, sits by me; upon her knees the open Bible, from which she has just read a lesson of the Gospel. And by me, as I write, stands Mary, with ten summers shining from her eyes—those eyes which repeat the loveliness and purity of her mother. In this calm moment, let me give a passing word to certain actors in these confessions. The poor girl by whose hands Burley Hayne met his death, acquitted perchance by a partial jury, dwells once more in her New-England home. Edward, once the “boy-burgler,” is now the graduate of a well-known college. Maria takes charge of my city mansion. As for myself, behold me! after all my trials, seated in my home, crowned with blessings of which I am all unworthy; wife by my side, and child resting on my arm. “Come hither, Mary, child, and let me look up in your face! May God's blessing and your mother's goodness be yours all the days of your life; and may —and may—the spirit of Eva, from the better land, stretch forth her arms to guide and guard you, Mary!” [Note by the Editor of these Papers.—It will be perceived that the “Life of a Man of the World” ends well, although perchance his mingled crimes and virtues merited a darker termination. He has told his story in his own way—a narrative of real life, with all its lights and shadows, and mingled impulses of good and evil. From this strange life every reader can draw the proper moral. Many a better man than Francis Van Warner, (or the person whose real name is concealed under this fictitious one.) has met with a worse fate in the living world around us; and many a worse man has existed in the same living world, committing all his faults without one ray of his virtues.] END OF THE CONFESSIONS OF A MAN OF THE WORLD.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">MARGARET DUNBAR. CHAPTER XXXIV. Among the unexplained mysteries of city life, none are more appalling than those we often find dimly hinted at in the newspapers, in paragraphs like the following: “Yesterday evening, the body of an unknown man, entirely divested of clothing, was found floating in the North River, Pier No. —. His hair was dark, and he appeared to be about thirty years of age. There was no mark upon him to indicate that he came to his death by violence, save indeed an abrasion of the skin on the right temple, evidently the result of contact with some object floating in the river. The coroner investigated the matter thoroughly; and the jury returned a verdict that the body of the unknown had been thrown into the river by resurrectionists. It was, after the inquest, properly interred in Potter's Field.” Such paragraphs, badly worded, and as terse as you call upon a waiter for another plate of muffins, or as the sentence of death pronounced in a criminal court by a judge anxious for his dinner, frequently appear in the papers. What do they mean? There is something infinitely horrible in the manner in which the history of the unknown deed is thus dispatched in ten brief lines, ending with,—“verdict of coroner's jury, thrown into the river by resurrectionists,” and “properly interred in Potter's Field.” The above paragraph appeared in most of the city papers not many years ago, say some time in the summer of 1852. What did it mean? Did it embody the real story of the unknown's fate? Was he, indeed, nothing more than the abandoned prey of resurrectionists, thrown by them into the river, or was he the victim of some unknown murderer? Paragraphs like the above often appear in the papers; let us take this single one, and probe the mystery which it hides. On a dreary winter night in 1848—49, there was the light of a happy hearth-side playing about a home in Broomestreet, half-way between Broadway and the North River. A two-storied house, built of dark red stone, stands a little apart from the street, from which it is separated by the fragment of a garden. The garden is now buried in snow, and the wind whirls the flakes against the windows, through whose closely-drawn curtains a softened ray streams out upon the desolate night. Look through the window-curtains, and you will behold a scene which contrasts pleasantly with the storm and darkness of the drear winter evening. A mother, whose dark hairs are veined with the silver threads of fifty years, sits in a rocking-chair near the fire, her hands folded, and her eyes fixed upon the daughter, the only child, who stands near her. The daughter, dressed in plain black, is a girl of some seventeen years, a little above the medium height, with a rounded form, clear complexion and luxuriant brown hair. Her eyes— dark hazel and very large—express a noble, a passionate and stainless soul. By no means perfectly beautiful, she is yet a woman whose roundly developed form, rich brown hair, and face lighted by eyes that shine clearly and steadily, would at once enchain your gaze, whether you first met her among the crowds of the sidewalk, or in the quietude of the parlor. And while her mother's gaze is fixed upon her, in all the warmth of a mother's love, her gaze is centered upon the young man by her side, whose hand she holds with both hers—a man in the prime of young manhood, with bold features, a bronzed complexion, dark hair, scattered carelessly over his forehead, and blue eyes, full of hope and life. He is neatly and plainly clad in black, and a black cravat tied loosely gives you a glimpse of his muscular throat. “But you may die!” are the first words which we hear from the lips of the young girl. “My heart trembles, Harry, as I think of the ten thousand dangers before you.” “Die?” There's no such word in my dictionary!” cries the young man in a frank, joyous voice. “Is there mother? The fevers on the Isthmus—the wild life in California—the odd sort of people I will meet in the mines—none of these things frighten me. I will go through all these things unscathed, and within a year from to-night come back rich. Do you hear me, Margaret?” Now, although the young man called the gray-haired woman mother, she was not his mother, only to be his mother-in-law. Margaret was his betrothed wife. He was about to leave the quiet routine of his life as a house-carpenter, and make one bold effort for fortune in California. “But why need you go?” said Margaret sadly. “Why not remain? Your wages are good; and, with what I can make by the needle, there is no doubt but that we can make our home happy. Think of what agonies of suspense I will suffer in the year of your absence.” “Remain!” echoed Harry, patting his hand lightly upon her brown hair. “Remain! Drive a jack-plane and pay rent all my life? Walk these streets all my days the slave of two masters—`boss' and landlord—when there is a fortune for me in California? Believe me, Margaret, for your sake more than mine, I'll do no such foolish thing. Don't you think I'm right, mother?” “There is a Providence in California, as well as in this city,” was the mother's reply; “and though I dread the thought of your going, still I think it best for us all. You will come back with a competence—” “Certainly I will,” cried Harry; “and then, Margaret, darling, we will be married—” The young girl made no reply at first; but, placing her hand on his shoulder, looked up silently into his face, her cheeks all aglow, and her eyes all clear and bright. “Living, I will be true to you, Harry, —and if you—you die, I will be true to your memory!” So low was the tone in which she spoke, that the mother did not hear it, but the lover heard it with his ears and heart; and, silently pressing the hand of his betrothed, surveyed her with his frank, earnest gaze. A very beautiful picture—that simple home, with its unostentatious furniture, and cheerful hearthside flame, whose light falls upon the faces of the mother, the betrothed husband and wife—a picture which it may be well for us to look upon long and yearningly, for it may never in their lives be seen again. That night passed away, and the next day and the day after. Henry Morgan, with Margaret always by his side, made every preparation for his California enterprise. At length the day came; the steamer was to leave near sunset, and Henry, with Margaret on his arm, walked forth in Broadway an hour before the time of his departure. How many vows were exchanged—how many hopes and fears of the future, rose to the lips in low-spoken words, as they hurried through the ever-strolling, never-resting current of Broadway! His trunks were all aboard; his ticket in his pocket; he had bidden “good-by” to the mother; nothing remained but to say the same to the good, beautiful girl, who clung to his arm, and looked up into his face. He often said,—“Only a year—I will come back rich!” but, somehow, he could not say “Good-by!” The bronzed face of the carpenter manifested a strange mingling of emotion and of the effort to hide it; and, at last, an idea seemed to strike him, which, he thought, would relieve him from many difficulties. He led Margaret from the glare and tumult of Broadway into a retired street, and up the steps of a two-story house, and rung the bell; and was ushered into a dimly-lighted parlor. Before Margaret could ask the meaning of this movement, a grave gentleman appeared in the parlor, very short in stature, mild in face, and very decided in the whiteness of his cravat. “What do you wish with me?”—in a bland, kind voice—“Ah!” glancing at the face of Harry, who blushed a little, and at Margaret's, which was scarlet as a summer rose,—“Ah! I see how it is!” “Marry us, if you please,” said Harry —“right away—I've got to start for California in half an hour.” “But Harry—” Margaret began; but Harry put his hand on her pretty lips, and the clergyman, after the proper preliminary questions, went through the ceremony, and presently pronounced them husband and wife. The thing was done so quickly that Margaret and Harry, who had always looked upon it as a matter requiring much time and many words, could scarce believe their senses. But, in that dimly-lighted parlor, where a few weak rays of sunlight came through the faded blinds, Harry saw the face of the blooming girl beside him, whose mingled tears and blushes looked like the mingled bloom and dew of some ungathered rose—took her to his arms, pressed his kiss upon her lips and cheek, and with a muttered “Good-by, Margaret! I'll be back in a year—rich—rich,” —hurried from the room. Hurried away from the room and house, like a thief, leaving his young wife, weeping on the sofa, with the kind old clergyman by her side; hurried down the narrow street, his hat drawn low upon his forehead, and did not look behind him until he stood upon the steamer's deck. (As a matter of historical justice, it may be as well to record the fact that, before leaving the room, he slipped a ten-dollar gold piece into the preacher's hand.) And as the steamer went down the Bay, which, in the smile of the setting sun, showed all its “white caps” topped with flashes of bright gold, Harry sadly paced the deck, his hands deep in his pockets, and his eyes turned yearningly over his shoulder toward New-York, which distance and shadow soon gathered in their embrace. As the last gleam of sunset, trembling on fast-fading Trinity spire, met his backward gaze, while, through the Narrows, the ocean opened, bleak and vast and cold before him, Harry dashed the tears from his eyes with the knuckles of his his sun-burnt hand, and gave some utterance to his feelings in these words,— “Bad papers, this! Marry a young wife, and then quit for Californey! Bad papers! Never mind; in a year I'll come back from Californey, and come back rich!” And as the steamer went forth gallantly into the cold black night, Harry gazed earnestly through the gathering darkness toward New-York, but did not see the woman who, clasping the Battery railing with both hands, followed the progress of her husband with heaving bosom and expanded eyes, glittering through their tears. She waited there until the cold night, domed with countless stars, gathered round her, and then turned sadly homeward, murmuring oftentimes her husband's words,—“Never mind! In a year I'll come back from Californey, and come back rich!” Well! a year, a long, long year passed, and Henry Morgan did not come back from California rich. In fact, did not come back at all. In his place appeared a line among the California news of the New-York Tub, (a paper devoted to the adroitly mingled worship of Good Lord! and Good Devil!) —a line which said a good deal in a few words,—“Died in the mines, August 29, 1849, Henry Morgan, Carpenter, from New-York.” Need we tell the agony of one woman who read this line, and who, in the depth of her despair, clung to the hope that, like most things which appeared in the New-York Tub—“reliable news” to-day, and “infamous fabrications” to-morrow— it would turn out a baseless falsehood? For a year she clung to this hope, but Henry Morgan did not appear. Another weary year!—every hour spent in the anguish of suspense, and every item of California news devoured with straining eyes —still no word of Henry Morgan. 1851 followed '49 and '50, and a returned Californian, very much the color of gamboge in face, and with much coin of the same color in pocket, brought word of Henry Morgan. He had seen him on the fatal day, August 29, 1849, propped up against a tree, friendless and uncared for, a beautiful landscape all about him, but the ashy color of death upon his face. Satisfied that the man was beyond all need or hope of help, the returned Californian had left him there to die. And that was the last of poor Henry Morgan! Time passed on, and it was November in 1852. As night set in upon the town—a dreary night, full of winter, and of the aroma of election in hand-bills—a steamer, just arrived from the Isthmus, lay puffing and blowing, like an exhausted whale, at a certain pier on the North River. Among the many wretches who crawled from the “Calcutta black-holes,” which, by a strong flight of speech, are called “berths,” was one who came eagerly on deck and hurried ashore as soon as the steamer was made fast to the pier. He left his dingy trunks (which had escaped the robbers of the Isthmus, perchance, to fall into the hands of the “gold-dust Peters” of Broadway) aboard, and made the best of his way up a dark street toward the great thoroughfare. As he passes through the light of an occasional lamp you can look at him. At first sight, he strikes with a vivid impression of general and confirmed “hairiness.” Tall, broad-shouldered, clad in an old coat which might have been worn in the ark, underneath which appeared a shirt of dingiest red, with boots reaching half-way to his waist, he was as hairy as any ten reformers. Long locks of dark-brown hair, innocent of Phalon, swept his shoulders, and were blown to and fro beneath his slouched hat by the sharp November wind; and a beard as huge as a lion's mane, and as black—as black—as the candidate of any political party which you don't like —hid his throat and a portion of his brawny chest. He was evidently a strong man, somewhat reduced and thinned by the Isthmus fever. That glimpse of his face, which his copious hair and beard permitted to be visible, was as yellow as a guinea, and his dark blue eyes, although bright and glittering, had something of the “gold-piece” hue about each pupil. Whoever this man was who now plunged into the crowd of Broadway, like a bit of savage life suddenly planted in the midst of city civilization, one thing is certain, his own mother would not have known him. “There's the Park,” he muttered, gazing about him, and much jostled by the crowd, “and there's Stewart's, and this is Broadway, and I'm in town again! I have come back from Californey, and come back rich!” And, placing his hand beneath his rough coat, he touched a massive gold chain, worth some hundreds of dollars, and curiously formed of pure ore, to which was attached a gold watch which he had purchased in San Francisco for two hundred dollars. Then he felt the gold pieces which filled his capacious pocket. “All safe! and then a snug fortune in the trunks aboard the steamer is safe too—and—I am in town, and rich! And—and—if—” here was the hard point to get over—“if I only find the folks alive and well!” And so, urged by that ugly “if!” he made the best of his way through Broadway, and then turned off into Broomestreet, and did not pause until he stood in front of a two-story house, which stood a little apart from the street. Through its curtained parlor windows lights were cheerfully shining. The Californian went through the little garden, and up the steps, and rang the bell. He was a strong man, but he trembled like a leaf, as he stood in the dark, awaiting an answer. It seemed an age until the door opened; but, at last, the door did open, and a face appeared. Alas! it was a strange face—that of a robust servant girl. “Does Mrs. Dunbar live here?” faltered the Californian. “Faith, she does not. It is Misthress Smith who lives here,”—and she made great eyes as she beheld, by the light which she carried, the uncouth, quite barbarian exterior of the stranger. “She used to live here; she occupied the rooms on the lower floor—a widow; her daughter was a seamstress,” faltered the Californian. “How long since?” “Well—well—” hesitated he, “about three years since.” “Three years! Faith, a great many things may happen in three years! Mrs. Smith moved here two years ago, and I've lived with her ever since.” And after another fearful look at the barbarous exterior of the Californian, she shut the door in his face. The man went sadly down the steps muttering gloomily,—“Very bad papers. What if they should all be dead?” It was a thought hard to look at with any calmness; and the Californian tried to banish it and choke it down, as he retraced his steps toward Broadway. It then occurred to him, that it would be a judicious thing, before proceeding further in his search, to remove some of the hair and beard which made a wilderness of his face. Full of this idea, the Californian proceeded to a fashionable barber shop, (called a saloon,) where, by the light of gas shining into any number of mirrors, and over countless bottles of hair oil, about a dozen gentlemen who spoke bad English and wore white aprons, were doing all sorts of things to all sorts of people's heads. There was a red-headed man being carefully dyed into black; a man of fifty, with gray whiskers and bald head, being elaborately transformed into a young man of twenty-five, with noat black whiskers and soft, curling, brown hair; and a youth of nineteen, with an innocent face and long hair, being scientifically curled for a fancy ball. The Californian dropped into a chair, and submitted his hair and beard to the scissors and razors of an august person of French origin. This accomplished, he rose and surveyed himself in a glass, and hair and beard having been brought down to the limits of city civilization, the Californian recognized in the mirror, with evident delight, the face of Henry Morgan—a face very sallow and gold-colored, but still the face of our old friend, Henry Morgan. “Well, Harry, you do look something like yourself! A white shirt collar, and a suit of black cloth, will set you up. And”—here, Harry's attention was suddenly arrested by a paper which fluttered to his feet. It was a letter which had fallen from the hands of a person near him; Harry took it up, in order to hand it to the person, when his eye was arrested by its superscription,—“Margaret Dunbar.” “What!” he said, before taking time for a second thought, “what do you know about Margaret Dunbar!” and confronted the individual who had dropped the letter. This individual merits a passing glance. He was (to speak in general terms) one of those mysterious, well-dressed people whom you meet every day in Broadway, and who are mysterious be cause no one can tell where all those fine clothes, eye-glasses, and gold chains, come from. To speak more specifically, he was a man of about thirty-five years, above the medium height, with a well-knit form, clad in dark broadcloth; a gold chain strayed over his red velvet vest, and on his faultless shirt-bosom shone a very brilliant diamond pin. As to his face, with its short hair and whiskers, black as jet and well oiled, it struck you at first sight. The cheek-bones were a little too high, the nose too sharp, the chin too pointed, and the lips too thin; the keen eyes, glittering under a broad, low forehead, and poorly defined eyebrows, were altogether too small; and yet it was a healthy, ruddy face, with a sort of robust manliness in every line of it. “What do you know of Margaret Dunbar?” said Morgan, holding the letter. The individual smiled, disclosing teeth whose whiteness was quite sepulchral. “And may I ask what in the deuce do you know about Margaret Dunbar?” he said very pleasantly, as the stranger drew over his shoulders a cloak richly lined with velvet. CHAPTER XXXV. “And,” said the strange gentleman, as he drew his velvet-lined cloak over his shoulders,—“And what in the deuce do you know about Margaret Dunbar?” To which Harry, somewhat taken aback by the cool manner of the gentleman, replied, after a little hesitation,— “Know about her?” Why, God bless you! she is my wife!” And drawing the individual a little aside, near a mirror which reflected their widely different faces, he told him, in his frank, honest way, the whole story: how he had loved Margaret—married her an hour before his departure for California —been delayed there by circumstances, over which he had no control, three years instead of simply one—how he had come back rich, with money enough to make Margaret comfortable all her days— and— “The fact is, here I am, a little yellow, and a little broken down, but with the rocks, you see? And I can't find my wife! God help me! she is not dead, is she?” The frank manner of Harry evidently gave the well-dressed stranger a favorable impression of him, which perhaps was not lessened by the story of the trunks, (packed with gold dust,) aboard the steamer, to say nothing of a glimpse of the heavy gold chain which encircled Harry's sunburnt throat. He showed his white teeth in a pleasant smile. “Sit down, Mr. Morgan!” and he pointed to a sofa near the mirror. “I've often heard Margaret speak of you. And the fact is, I am her cousin. My name is Burke, Stanley Burke. Now you certainly have heard Margaret speak of me?” Harry was not quite sure that he had, but still there was a floating impression upon his mind about one Stanley Burke, a member of a wealthy branch of the Dunbar family. Yes! he was sure that he had heard Margaret speak of him a hundred times. “Yes, I have heard her speak of you —and—” his voice was thick, his blue eyes moistened with something that was very like a tear—“and she is not dead, is she?” How he bent forward, and looked Stanley Burke in the face, on his eagerness to hear his reply! That gentleman suffered the velvet-lined cloak to drop a little from his shoulders, as he replied,— “Dead! bless you, no! It was only yesterday morning I saw her, alive and well, and —.” Harry did not like to ask the question which rose to his lips, “She is not married, is she?” it choked him only to think of it. So he blunted forth another question,—“A rumor came home that I was dead, I believe. Margaret never believed it, eh?” “She wears black for you now,” was the response of Stanley Burke. “The poor girl will be mad to see you; in fact, unless properly prepared for the intelligence, it will drive her mad to know that you are alive—mad with joy, you understand?” Harry leaned back upon the sofa like a man suddenly overcome by irreparable calamity, or overwhelming joy. For a moment he was dim of sight; all sorts of ringing sounds were in his ears. The memory of three years of hard adventure in California, in which he had seen starvation, death, and crime, in their ugliest shapes; the consciousness that he had come back rich, all faded away before the thought, “Margaret is living! Margaret is true to me!” And as soon as he recovered his speech he did a very bad thing; he gave some vent to his feelings in an oath, which properly looked into was not so much of an oath as a prayer. And then he talked with Stanley Burke for at least an hour, and the manner of the well-dressed gentleman quite won his confidence. It seemed as though they had been acquainted for years. Margaret had removed from Broomestreet, and was living with her mother further up town. The death of a distant relative, who had made Margaret his heir, placed them in very comfortable circumstances. She was no longer forced to strain her eyes, all day and late at night, at her needle. She was sad and melancholy about Harry's death, but still young and blooming, and with a faint hope in her heart that he would yet return. Such was the story of Mr. Alfred Stanley, which he told in many words, and in the blandest manner, with every kind of display of his white teeth, and a steady twinkle of his small glittering eyes. “And this letter, which by chance dropped from my hand,”—he quietly held the letter before Harry's eyes,—“is one which I wrote to her about a year ago, giving her some hope of your return. The fact is, I had heard some favorable news. But, before I could send it to her, I met her in person, and so there was no use of giving it to her. I threw it in my trunk; and to-day it must have been taken by me from the same trunk, with some legal papers which I wished to examine. I did not know it was about me until it dropped from my pocket. It has turned out quite a lucky circumstance, for it has been the means of bringing you and me together. Would you like to look at it?” “Not to-night—not to-night,” replied Harry. “First of all I want to see Margaret. You will take me at once to her residence?” It would have been better for Harry —much better—had he looked into that letter! “The fact is, Margaret and her mother are out of town on a visit to a relative who lives near Tarrytown,” replied Stanley Burke, quietly depositing the letter in his pocket-book; “but,” he continued as he observed Harry's down-fallen countenance, “they'll be back to-morrow. I can prepare them for your appearance. By George! an idea strikes me. Why not go up there to-night with your traps and trunks, so as to be on hand at the time of their return. You see, I'm not often in town, but when I am, Mrs. Dunbar gives me a spare room, which you and I can occupy to-night. I have a night-key which will let us in.” And the well-dressed man, looking at Harry all the while, passed his hand over his spotless shirt-bosom, through his well-oiled whiskers and short-cut hair, a pleasant smile, meantime, lighting up his masked face. It was a good idea—capital! Harry thought so, and lost no time in carrying it out. They went forth from the saloon together, Harry in barbarian garb, leaning on the arm of the well-dressed man, who, as they hurried along Broadway and down the street which led to the steamer, kept up a continual flow of talk about Margaret, telling a thousand anecdotes about her which quite won Harry's heart. Arrived at the pier where, in the gloomy night and under the leaden sky, the steamer lay, Mr. Burke procured a carriage, had Harry's luggage brought ashore, one huge trunk lashed on behind, one fixed on the box, and a plethoric carpet bag put on the front seat inside; after which, the driver being perched on his seat, over the topmost trunk, Harry and Stanley Burke entered, and the carriage rolled away. As they sat side by side on the back seat, Stanley Burke, his face lighted up by an occasional lamp gleam, talked pleasantly and in his easy way about Margaret, and Harry, his heart beating quickly under his coarse coat, hung on his every word. “Decidedly, Stanley Burke is a good fellow!” thought Harry, “and if he wants helping along, I'm his man!” Here the carriage stopped, in a dark part of a street which, near the head of Broadway, branched off toward the East River, in front of a four-storied dwelling, which stood silent and dark in the shadow, its windows closed from side-walk to roof. “A grand kind of building!” muttered Harry as they descended from the carriage. “The home of Margaret,” replied Stanley Burke. “The lower floor is, as you see, occupied as a store; Margaret and her mother have the rest of it to themselves. My room is in the back part of it, on the third floor.” And opening the side door with a night-key, Stanley Burke directed the driver to unlash the trunks, and bring them into the dark entry, which being done, Burke left Harry and the driver alone in the dark entry, while he went up stairs to get a light. He presently returned, holding the light above his head, as he came down the stairway, his usual bland smile playing over his face. And he held the light while the driver, (a pock-marked Hibernian, who blew hard, and swore much in a low voice,) assisted by Harry, carried the trunks, one at a time, up three pair of stairs, into the back room. Trunks and carpet-bag being safely deposited there, and the driver paid and dismissed, Harry and Burke sat down in the room, and looked on each other's faces by the light of the candle. It was a very comfortable place. A moderate fire simmered in an air-tight wood stove. The sofa on which they sat was covered with red velvet. An elegant French bedstead stood in one corner, near a mahogany article of furniture, which did not look precisely like a book-case, nor yet like a bureau, but seemed a combination of both. The walls, covered with subdued colored paper, were ornamented with a few choice pictures, in slight gilt frames—pictures very warm, Gallic and oriental. It was altogether an elegant yet cozy apartment. Resting one arm on the arm of the sofa, and seated in an attitude which did justice to his fine apparel and muscular frame, Stanley Burke quietly watched his rough friend, who was gazing about him with expanded eyes. “A quiet little place, which Aunt Dunbar is kind enough to let me have, in one corner of her house. Don't you think so?” said Mr. Burke. 'Snug as a bug in a rug,” was the unclassical response of Harry. “Here you can remain quietly with me, and to-morrow morning you will see Margaret. Ah! I had quite forgotten!” continued Mr. Stanley Burke, as he rose and assumed his cloak, hat and gloves. “I have an engagement which will only keep me for an hour. You must excuse me for that time, my dear Morgan. When I come back, we'll have a nice little supper from the restaurant in Broadway. Until then, amuse yourself with books and papers on the table.” “O don't mind me,” replied Harry; “I can put in the time quite comfortably. Have you got such a thing as a good Havana cigar?” Burke showed his white teeth in a pleasant smile as he presented his cigar case. “A present from a particular friend in Havana.” And as Harry lighted the fragrant cigar, and stretched himself, red shirt, coarse coat and all, on the velvet sofa, Mr. Stanley Burke regarded him with a quiet smile, and then, with the words,— “Back in an hour, Morgan,” left the room. There was no light to shine upon him, or to show the peculiar expression of his face, as he went down the dark staircase. “In the house where Margaret lives!” ejaculated Harry, as he watched the white smoke-wreaths floating to the ceiling. “Pretty good luck, this, after all your adventures, Harry!” And Harry fell into a pleasant reverie, in which he saw the form of Margaret clad in mourning, her face not so blooming as of old, but still beautiful in its pallor, framed in a black bonnet, appear almost visibly amid the smoke-wreaths which went up from his cigar. “How glad she'll be to see me!” And his heart, at the thought, beat all the quicker under his coarse coat. All at once a new idea seemed to strike him. “Why not go out, and buy some decent clothes? I can be back before Burke returns. I should like to shake hands with a decent coat and clean shirt, once more.” Burke had left his night-key, on a duplicate, on the table. Harry secured this key, put on his slouched hat, and went quietly down the dark stairway and from the house. In less than a quarter of an hour he found himself in Canal-street, in front of one of those stores which, in flaming signs and pictorial handbills, offer to furnish “Cheap Shirts” to a benighted world. The “Only original shirt store, on the cheap system, in the world!” was the startling announcement which appeared in the window, in big letters, revealed by the dazzling gas-light. After a careful survey of the contents of the window, Harry resolved to enter and make a purchase; and enter he did. Better, much better for Harry, had he looked at the letter which Burke had held before his eyes; but a thousand times better for him had he never put a foot in the Canal-street shirt store. CHAPTER XXVI Harry entered the store, and as he crossed the threshold—before he had time to scan the sharp features of the proprietor, who stood quietly leaning over the glass case on the counter— there passed by him a young woman, poorly dressed, her face hidden by a thick green veil. Her faded garments brushed him, as he entered; and, ere he could look around, she had passed through the door and disappeared. What was it about the young woman which, even as her garments brushed against him filled him with a sudden and inexplicable interest? The gas-light shone fully upon her, but did not disclose her features—did Harry obtain a glimpse of her countenance through the thickly covered veil? “Shirts, sir?” smirked the bland proprietor, who was a little man, with sharp nose and gold spectacles. “Shirts of all sizes, patterns and prices—returned from California, I presume, sir?” “Who was that young lady?” asked Harry, keeping one eye upon the shirt man, and the other upon the door. “Don't know her name—works for me—just paid her off—pay well here, sir, four shillings for two shirts—here they are—best quality—take a look at them!” Harry did not reply to the gentleman, but, turning on his heel, left the store, and anxiously gazed up and down Canal-street. He caught a glimpse of the summer bonnet which the young woman wore, about a hundred yards away, in the direction of the North River. At once he hurried after her, determined to track her footsteps and follow her to her home. Now, as Harry was a sound, honest man, he could have had no improper intentions in this pursuit, but was evidently prompted by an indefinable impulse, or a wild delusion. Why need we describe in detail the wild chase which she led him? She entered one of the red cars which run on West Broadway, Hudson-street, and the Eighth avenue; Harry followed her, but could not get a seat near her. She sat in an opposite corner, out of the light and in the shadow, her veil still closely drawn over her face. The car went on its way; the conductor, a slim person, filled with a due sense of the awful responsibility of his situation, bristled along collecting fares, letting fat gentlemen out, and nervous ladies in; and now and then shaking up a drunken man, who fell asleep and snored like a trombone. The car went on its way up Hudson-street, and into the remote regions of the Eighth avenue, where the night is made musical by the combined bark of a thousand dogs; and still Harry, very nervous and impatient, could not obtain a sight of the unknown woman's face. At last the passengers were reduced to two, Harry and the young woman, who sat with closed veil and folded hands, opposite him. “I wonder if she never intends to get out, or if she is going on to the North Pole?” grumbled Harry to himself, when the woman in the straw bonnet rose, rang the bell, and, in a moment, hurried from the car. Harry at once followed her, and found himself in that peculiar region which is not above Seventieth-street, nor below Thirtieth; where it is, precisely, isn't any one's business. It is a region extending from the avenue to the Hudson River, and over its broken surface old-fashioned country seats vainly endeavor to maintain their position against flimsy modern structures, of all sizes, from a hencoop to a barn, and built not so much with a view to comfort or architectural beauty as for the purpose of extracting the greatest amount of rent from the neediest sort of tenants. By day this region rings with the ceaseless thunder of blasted rocks; by night, it alarms the distant Jersey shore with the rich, deep notes of an army of dogs, whose numbers cannot possibly be told. Gazing over its varied surface, from the height of the reservoir, you are struck with the singular panorama which it presents. Bogus palaces, truck gardens, fine old country seats, perched upon the rocks, wide streets that are by turns miracles of dust and mud: it looks like the sketch of a city done very hastily by an artist who is anxious to do his work in the least possible time. It is from this region that, near the break of day, emerge those mysterious men who walk between the shafts of a two-wheeled cart, a harnessed dog on either hand, and a patient woman pushing in the rear. Mysterious men, whose apparition startles belated downtowners (unfamiliar with the upper region) and gives rise to the query—“Where in the mischief do they live?” Descending from the car, Harry followed the unknown woman into a neighboring grocery, whose lighted windows looked quite cheerful in the surrounding darkness. The grocery was one of those kept by taciturn persons of Teutonic descent, who speak strong German, and very imperfect English, never count the half cent on the shilling in making change, and sell everything—everything from a glass of dubious ardent spirits to a sixpence worth of coal or firewood. Into such a store, Harry followed the unknown. The proprietor, a gloomy German, with unshaven beard, stood behind the counter, his sad vissage giving a melancholy hue to various articles, vegetable and fleshy, which encircled him. Without raising her veil, the young woman opened her hand, laid a solitary half dollar on the counter, and in a low voice, inaudible to Harry, who stood watching near the door, made her purchases. O fashionable dames! who, softly clad in satin and in velvet, wrapped luxuriously in finest linen, languidly descending from your carriages to “shop” at Stuart's, how you would have stared had you seen the poor seamstress do her “shopping” in the Teutonic grocery! A pound of coffee, a pound of sugar, an armful of firewood, a loaf of bread, these were her purchases. O softly clad and fashionable dames! and yet perchance that poor girl who gathered in her arms those sticks of firewood, had blood as precious in her veins as that which gives its glow to your own lovely face! Her purchases made, she—firewood, coffee and sugar in her arms—left the store without glancing at Harry. But Harry, who felt an unusual emotion about his heart as she passed him, followed her from the store, and then along a dark street which led to the Hudson River, displaying on either hand, under the dull, heavy night, a large proportion of building lots to a very small number of houses. Along this dreary street, where the mud was rich and thick, and of the first quality, Harry Morgan followed the young woman, who once or twice stopped and looked back, as though conscious that she was followed. Harry, however, kept in the shadow, and cautiously lingered in her footsteps. At length she turned from the street into an open field, from whose distant extremity a feeble ray struggled from the window of a miserable tenement. Along a footpath, soft with mud, and winding among piles of timber and broken rocks, the young woman hurried rapidly, until she came to the narrow door of the solitary house which stood alone in a bleak space—where she lingered for a moment to look back, and then disappeared. Harry advanced from the shadow to the window, and, shrouded by the dark night, looked through an aperture of the window-curtains. He saw the young woman standing in a wretched apartment, light in hand, her darkly attired form thrown strongly into view by the bare white walls and uncarpeted floor. A small sheet-iron stove, a table of unpainted wood, and two chairs, constituted the furniture of the place. She stood there, still veiled, light in hand, and Harry could mark the pulsations of her bosom by the movement of her faded shawl. After a moment she opened a door, and disappeared into a second room, and all was dark. Certainly Harry's heart thumped and thumped again, as leaning against the window-sill he waited for her reappearance. After a pause she came again, and, light in hand, knelt before the stove, and proceeded to make a fire. In doing this, she lifted her veil and laid her bonnet on a chair. The candle on the floor shone upward into her face. “O my God!” was the ejaculation which came from Harry's heart as he leaned against the window-sill, trembling in every limb as that face was revealed to him. CHAPTER XXXVII. O my God!” cried Harry, who at the sight of that face grew suddenly weak as a child; “it's Margaret!” The woman who knelt before the stove, her face revealed by the upcast light of the candle, had seen twenty years of life. Her brown hair relieved a pale countenance, lighted by large hazel eyes. There was great loveliness and much suffering conjoined in every line of that countenance—deep suffering, that does not relieve itself in tears or wild ejaculations, but seats itself at the heart, and slowly gnaws the life away. Poor Margaret! when we saw you last, you were so blooming on lip and cheek; there was such joyousness in your eyes—not a pulse of your young bosom but swelled with the inspiration of hope and love—and now, so sorrow-stricken and heart-broken, with the fever of an irreparable calamity burning in your large beautiful eyes! It's a world of change, Margaret—of sad, terrible change—of friendships that betray with a kiss—of loves that are bought and sold, like merchandize in the marketplace—of hopes that are nourished through long years, and that ripen to fulfilment only to be gathered by the hand of death—physical death, killing the body, or that unutterable moral death which ossifies the soul; a world, Margaret, which no one in the dawn of manhood or womanhood, seeing, as with prophetic sight, all the way of the future, plain as day, would have the courage to live in for a single hour. And if, since last we saw you, Margaret, you have sinned; if the pure blossom of your virgin soul has been trampled into the mire of temptation and crime, why, God be merciful to you, and may you rather be dealt with by His justice than by the tenderest mercy of man! On the window-sill Harry leaned, stricken into child-like weakness by that sight. “And so Burke lied to me,” he muttered. “But he spoke so smooth and fair, I could'nt help believe him! This is livin' on your means, is it? A half a dollar, a pound o' sugar and coffee, an' a home like this! Such means and such livin'!” Again Harry laid his face against the window-pane, with a faint hope that it might not be his Margaret whom he saw thus reduced to the lowest stage of destitution—but no! His eyes did not deceive him. That pale woman, kneeling on the naked floor, was his Margaret— his wife! “But I'll make it all right yet; for every day of want that you have suffered, you shall have a thousand of peace and comfort, and—” Harry went from the window, put his hand upon the door, and entered the miserable room, pausing a short space from the threshold, so that the candlelight lit up his sunburnt face. Margaret raised her eyes with a nervous movement of surprise, and then her eyes expanded, her face grew paler, and with a wild scream she stretched forth her arms. God help me! It is his ghost!” And fell forward upon her face like a dead woman. Henry knelt on the floor beside her, and took her to his bosom tenderly with his toil-hardened hands, pushing her unloosened hair aside from her face, and more than once pressing his lips to her cold forehead and colder lips. All the while the light which shone upward upon his face showed every feature working, spasm-like, as though the man could not speak, to tell in words the emotions which swelled his chest. “I am back again, and rich—rich do you hear me, Margaret?” he said, again and again, holding her in his arms, and gazing upon her face with all the tenderness of a rude-looking but kind-hearted nurse soothing a sick child. “Rich! rich! Not so rich as Astor, but rich enough for both of us!” Alas! brave Harry! there are some evils which gold, holy and beautiful as it is—gold, so devoutly worshipped every where, cannot cure! It was a long time before her cheek glowed with the color of life again; and a long time even after she unclosed her eyes, and saw his face and heard his voice, that she could realize that it was her husband who held her in his arms. “God help me! Harry, it is you, indeed!” was her first exclamation, as she surveyed that honest face, which was changed, in some respect, but still glowed with old love for her. “I've thought you as dead so long—seen you dead awake and in my dreams so long, that—” tears came to her relief and she bent her head and wept upon his breast; wept, as though every fibre of her heart was breaking, and put her arms couvulsively about his neck, as if she were drowning in some dark river, and in his arms was her only hope of life. At length she rose, and glancing rapidly (with a singular look, which did not escape Harry,) first at the door which led out in the dark night, and then at the door, which opened into the second room, she sat down and motioned Harry to take a seat beside her. Her eyes were downcast, and she picked at the ends of her shawl in an absent way. “Why do I find you here, Margaret,” said Harry, “in such poverty?—” The name of Stanley Burke, and the story which Stanley had told him, rose to his lips; but he thought he would not mention either, until Margaret spoke of her cousin. “And mother, how is she?” “Hush! She is very sick there,” and Margaret pointed nervously to the door of the next room. “She is sleeping for the first time in a long while. Do not speak loud, Harry,”—how odd the old name sounded from her lips!—“do not speak loud!” And a shudder like an ague-chill pervaded her frame. “But why, Margaret, darling? Oh! how often I've thought of you in the rain and heat and cold, in the mines and on the sea, and when they left me, as they thought, dyin' at the foot of the tree, I saw your face and heard your voice, even in my fever. Oh! Margaret! you can never know how dear to me you've been! Why do I find you and mother in such a miserable place as this?” She looked up into his face, long and eagerly, as though the sight of it was life to her. “It is a long story, Harry, and to-night is not the time to tell it; and to-morrow I will tell you all!” “But you must leave this place to-night; you shall not sleep another night under such a miserable roof.” “You forget that mother is very sick, and cannot be moved; to-morrow, Harry, will be time enough.” And they talked together of the past and future, Harry gazing earnestly upon his wife, and she now looking up in his face, and now casting that nervous glance from one door to the other. How his heart rolled forth in his pictures of the future! And how often, after a yearning gaze in his face, she would turn her face away from the light, as if to hide its sudden pallor, and the quick, involuntary quivering of the lips. “Leave me, Harry, to-night;” she said at last, “mother is very ill, and I am worn with work and watching. To-morrow I will tell you how we came to live in this miserable place. Yes,” she said with a singular brightening of her gaze—“to-morrow we will talk of our future life!” And she rose from her chair, and Harry rose, but it was not until he had taken her once more to his bosom, pillowed her head upon his shoulder, and pressed upon her lips a kiss—we will not assert decisively that there was only one kiss —which seemed to bear with it a whole lifetime of hope and love, condensed into a single moment, that Harry could be induced to think of leaving her. At last he stood ready to depart. “To-morrow! early to-morrow!” he said. “To-morrow!” echoed Margaret; and, after another kiss, she watched the form of Harry as he moved to the door—oh! the strange, mad intensity of her gaze! At the door, Harry paused and looked back. Margaret stood like a statue in the centre of the room, and while her face had grown paler, her eyes were all the brighter. “Harry!” the name came from her lips in a thick and broken voice, and she bounded to his arms and hung there, sobbing and trembling on his breast. “Go, now,” she said, “and to-morrow— to-morrow!” The words died on her lips, and she wrung Harry's hands within her own as she followed him over the threshold. “Good-night! to-morrow, darling!” She heard his voice, even after the shadows of the night had taken his form from her sight. And she stood in the doorway a long time, looking after him, as though her gaze could pierce the darkness round her. As for Harry, he went on his way, muttering, “And now, Mr. Stanley Burke, I guess you and I will have a talk together. These trunks aint safe in your clutches. By Jove! why did not I think of mentionin' the matter to Margaret?” And with the thought of Stanley Burke's falsehood, and the consciousness that Margaret was still the Margaret of other days, occupying his mind by turns, he went on his way. But the words which he uttered, as he thought, to the air alone, were overheard by a listener whose form was hid by the shadows around the path. Turning from the door, Margaret closed it, and approached the light. A sudden change had come over her. Her face, pale enough before, was now livid and ashy. She trembled in every limb. As she took up the candle and went to-wards the next room, you could see the light shake and quiver, as if in sympathy with the terror which pervaded her frame. She entered that room, and gazed around it with a look that was nervous, wild, almost mad—a small chamber, miserably furnished, with a bed in one corner. There was no one there; the face of the mother did not meet the rays of the candle. No mother there for, alas! the mother of Margaret had been in her grave two years. Margaret advanced to the bed, and held the light over the patched coverlet, and drew that coverlet gently from the pillow. Upon that pillow rested a babe, who, perchance, had seen three months of life; and its rosy face was touched by a smile as it slept all calmly and gently there. “O my God!” burst from the heart of Margaret, as she fell weeping on the pillow beside the child—her child! “O my God! why did I not tell him all?” CHAPTER XXXVIII. Let us leave Margaret for a little while, and return to Stanley Burke. When that gentleman left Harry in his room, and went down the dark stairway, there was no light to reveal the peculiar expression of his face; but, as he passed along Broadway, walking rapidly through its crowd, his velvet-lined cloak dangling from one shoulder, and brought under his left arm, the gas-light shone fully upon him, and in spite of the shadow of his down-drawn hat, lit up his visage, and showed the peculiar look in palpable hideousness. The tightly compressed lips, the small eyes glittering beneath the knit brows, the expanded nostrils, and broad, low forehead, covered with sudden wrinkles, all revealed the singular agitation which now moved the man. And now and then the gentleman would smile—such a smile! It lit up his high cheek-bones into a flush, gave a fiercer twinkle to his small eyes, and showed his white teeth in ghastlier whiteness—(Burke, like Dickens' Carker, had white teeth, but he was totally a different man from Carker, and we didn't steal the teeth from Dickens)— and even suffused his broad low forehead with its sinister glow. What was the man thinking about? Why had he inveigled Harry Morgan to his room? Why filled the honest mechanic with the falsehood that Margaret and her mother lived in the house of which his room was a part? Had he designs upon Harry, and if he had designs upon Harry and his well-filled trunks, how did he intend to carry them out? Grave questions and full of meaning; but, as we cannot look into the heart of Stanley Burke, and note clearly the emotions that grapple there, it is not possible to answer them. The truth is, Stanley, having seen Harry and his trunks safely lodged in his room, had come forth to take the fresh air, and to think. It might have frightened you to have seen his thoughts, could they have taken palpable shape. And while he goes up Broadway, unconscious of the crowd through which he passes, now scowling and now smiling, now twirling his gold en chain, and now drawing his cloak closer round him, let us take a glimpse at the real character of Stanley Burke. He was a character. It is a great mistake to suppose that there are no savages but those who go naked and paint their faces, and eat their slain. Broadcloth drapes many a savage, fiercer and more completely infernal than any that ever sat down to a cannibal feast in the wilds of Van Dieman's Land. The externals of a gentleman, fine apparel, the graces of education, may mask the real nature of such a savage, but still, at heart, he is more remorseless— more completely defiant of all the ties which bind man to man and humanity to God than his tatooed brother of the war-club and jungle. Stanley Burke was a man of the world in the intensest form. To live well, to gratify all his appetites, without one effort of honest work, of hand or brain, and without coming within the reach of the iron hand of the law, was the religion of his life. For years he had made money, and much of it, in various ways, and always kept up a good appearance, and yet somehow, he was always in want of money. To say that he was a gambler would but poorly describe him. All men of the world are gamblers, in some sense or other—at faro, in stocks, in trade, in their own reputation, or in the reputation of other people—but the mere gambler at cards is the smallest of his tribe; he only injures and affects a very silly and limited class. The man is dangerous who, to the character of a gambler—a lottery broker of chance and huckster of destiny—adds other qualities, which mask and ornament his real nature. Stanley Burke was such a man. For years he had lived well, appeared in elegant plumage, kept the company of that genteel class who, polluted with the moral assassination of womanhood, are yet received with the best society—but where the means came from, was a secret known only to a few. Stanley had gambled at faro and at bank-stock. He had lived by turns in all the large cities of the Union. Now, he was (or seemed to be) a cotton broker in New-Orleans; now, a fancy stock man in Wall-street; now, a planter in Charleston; now, a commission merchant in Cincinnati; now, a gentleman of leisure in Washington; but he always made money, and was always in want of money. He had seen every phase of the savage life, which is but poorly hidden by the glittering tinsel-cloak of large city civilization, and that life had taken possession of him, and moulded him in every fibre. It was this man who now walked Broadway—thinking—and Henry Morgan and his well-filled trunks were the matters which occupied his thoughts. Thus occupied he reached Union-square, and pausing for a moment, looked up to the leaden sky. “It may be a good plan”—he muttered, as if speaking of some secret purpose—“and it may not! Anyhow, the opportunity is golden, and I must not let it slip. And I must decide upon it anyhow, before I return to my room and confront Morgan.” And he smiled, and his small dark eyes emitted a light that was not pleasant to look upon, as he—for the moment forgetting his usual composed demeanor —raised his clenched hand to the darkened sky. “To my room—the plan is good; or, if it won't do, I must and can find a better—to my room, and confront Morgan.” He little deemed that Morgan was no longer in his room, but far away in a far different apartment. Return we to the miserable home of Margaret, where she bends over her babe, her tears moistening the pillow on which it rests. “My God!” was the exclamation, often repeated—wrung from a heart torn by its agony—“My God! Why did I not tell him all?” And, rising, she held the candle over the face of the babe, and looked at it, with a look most strange to see upon a woman's face—remorseless hate and yearning love were in her straining eyes. A part of her being— the blossom of her life—it slumbered there, and yet it was the external symbol of a fact, which, but to think upon, made her existence a hell. Sad mother! Innocent child! There is a blot upon your life, mother, which cannot be washed away—a future before you, child, that has no ray of hope upon its darkened brow. Margaret went into the next room, placed the candle on the table, and sat down in the chair, where Harry had lately sat, and folding her hands on her knees—her foot moving nervously all the while—gazed at the blank wall with great glaring eyes. But she did not see the wall—the word “to-morrow!” seemed painted on the air, even as it was stamped upon her brain—“to-morrow!” She saw, or seemed to see, this word quivering there in letters of fire; and it held her gaze, or if she turned her eyes away, it was still before her. “To-morrow! How shall I meet him! How shall I tell him all! How tell him that the woman he loves—his wife—who promised to be true to him while living and to his memory when dead—who, to-night, saw him start up as if from the grave, and hang upon his breast as in other days—that she is—” Her lips could not speak the word, but she put both hands over her eyes at the very thought. And the light of the candle fell upon the bare department, and upon the woman, who sat trembling there, the very embodiment of hopeless misery. All at once the door opens, and a form appears on the threshold. It is Harry come back! Margaret starts up at the thought; but, when she sees the face of the intruder, sits down again, and crouches against the wall, as though he were some savage animal. “Well, wife! you see I've come!” It was Mr. Stanley Burke who spoke. “Wife!” she echoed, and crouched closer to the wall. “Yesterday I found you out, and told you I'd come to see you to-night,” continued the gentleman, dropping into a chair. “D—n the place, how cold it is!” and he drew his velvet-lined cloak closer around his shoulders. “You don't seem glad to see me? Here's a sweet, dear huzzy of a wife, who runs away from a husband, hides herself from him for six months or more, and when he finds her out and comes to see her, meets him with the look of an enraged cat that would like to bite, but—is afraid!” Margaret made no reply, but crouching closer to the wall, looked at him over her shoulder; her eyes alone seemed living in her face. Don't be surprised at Stanley's rough language. The man who can bow the lowest on Broadway, and show his teeth in the blandest manner, is very often the same man who, within four walls, insults, taunts—sometimes beats—a defenceless woman. Do not believe all that you see in Broadway, or at the opera, or at a pleasant social party; behind all these, there is a dark background of homes whose secrets would appall you, whose miseries would strike you dumb. “There we were, the very models of perfection,” continued Stanley, shutting one eye, as he gazed upon her with an insolent leer, “man and wife in our two rooms; how we loved each other! As if our happiness was not complete, a pledge of our love, (that, I believe, is the true novel style,) was about to appear, when you must run away and hide, and plunge yourself up to the neck in misery and shirt-making. How is shirt-making, pet?” No reply from Margaret. Crouching even closer to the wall, her face turned over her shoulder, she looked at him with that corpse-like face and those great glaring eyes. “If you don't like me, why did you marry me?” he said, as insolently as you can imagine a smoothly-dressed brutal man to speak. Without changing her position, Margaret replied. She did not start, and call down thunders, and burst into those torrents of epithets and adjectives with which some lady-novelists make lurid their pages; for she was not the kind of woman you find in some specimens of lady-literature, but a real woman! much tried, deeply suffering— may be, somewhat fallen—but still a woman and not a tornado in petticoats. Margaret replied in a low voice, so low that it scarcely rose above a whisper. “I was upon a sick bed. Mother was dead, and the expenses of her funeral exhausted all my store of money. I was sick, and friendless, and penniless.” “Did the thought of that dead lover of yours make you sick?” brutally interrupted Stanley. But, without changing her position, or noticing his remark, Margaret went on. “You appeared. You were kind to me. You know I wouldn't say it, if it wasn't true, but you were kind to me. You supplied me with money, procured a nurse to watch over me while I was wild with fever. I thought you did all this because we were cousins; I did'nt know when a man like you treats a woman kindly he always does it with a purpose; he is kind, that he may pollute, betray, and—sell! “Well! why did you marry me?” again interrupted Stanley, with a wicked light in his eye. “I recovered, and was grateful. Need I tell you how the thousand attentions with which you surrounded me deceived me as to your real character.” “Yes, I remember,” and Stanley laughed. “I used to sit by you praising your dead lover, the defunct carpenter. It's a sure way to touch a woman's heart.” She went on. “Alone in the world— friendless—all that I loved in the grave —in an evil hour, telling you that I could not give you love, simply esteem, I consented to become your wife. I might find a thousand excuses for this— might say that long-indulged grief and sickness had weakened my will and dimmed my perception—but I make no excuse. I married you. There is no excuse for me. And I bear the suffering which that marriage has cost me as my just due. The truth is, that I cannot suffer too much for it.” Her eyes dropped; a single tear rolled down her colorless cheek. And she shuddered as she had shuddered every time Burke alluded to her lover, Harry Morgan. “Why did you run away from me?” asked Stanley, the same devil's look in his eye. She looked at him as though he were a reptile which she did not know whether to despise most or fear, and her pale face grew scarlet. “Don't ask me, Stanley. You know why I left you. And you know that rather than be near you, or have you in my sight for an hour, I would—I would—” She had no word to express the loathing which flashed from her eyes. Stanley, whose face during this strange interview was unusually flushed—whose eye shone with even an unusual wickedness—replied: “Well, pet! like me or not, you must live with me. The law you know gives a husband a very decided power over an unruly wife. You must live with me. You cannot hide yourself where I wont find you. And to-morrow I'll come to bring you from this wretched place to a very comfortable home. You'll think better of it, darling.” And he rose, drawing the velvet-lined cloak closer about him, and advanced a step toward her. There was a certain wildness in his manner which she had never seen before. O how she longed to say a word which would humble all his schemes into dust! “Harry lives! I am not your wife, even if I never can be wife to him! You have no power over me in law!” The words were on her lips, but she lid not utter them. “How's the baby, Maggy, dear!” and he advanced a step nearer. “Think of it! It was only yesterday that I first beheld the face of my only child! And” —rapidly advancing, he seized her in his arms, and put his kiss upon her lips, ere she had the most remote idea of his intentions. Struggling in his embrace, as though his very touch was pestilence, she tried to avoid his kisses, by burying her head upon his hated bosom, but his strong arm held her in a clutch that was like that of death to the pale, quivering woman. “Here's an affectionate wife” he laughed, and released her. She sank into the chair, pale and panting for breath, her hair (loosened in the struggle) streaming over her shoulders. Then with a laugh, and a look of taunting insolence, he said,—“To-morrow, pet! you remember! To-morrow!” and showing his white teeth he moved to the door. “To-morrow I will come and bring you. Good-night, pet!” he laughed again, opened the door, and was gone. She breathed freer, like one suddenly taken from a plague-infected room into open air. “To-morrow!” she echoed; “little does he know of to-morrow!” As she spoke, her eye was attracted by something on the floor. It glittered in the light. She took it up—it was a gold chain—and had fallen from the neck of Stanley in the late struggle. It was not the gold chain he usually wore, but a gold chain curiously formed of pure ore; the chain which she had seen glittering not an hour before around the neck of Harry Morgan. There was something in the sight of it which seemed to paralyze Margaret in every limb, and deprive her for the moment of the power of speech. Her eyes were riveted to the chain, and she remembered that, even as Stanley held her in his arms, there was a livid bruise upon his right hand. CHAPTER XXXIX. We left Margaret, gazing in dumb horror upon the gold chain, which was curiously fashioned of links of pure ore. It was late on the next afternoon that Stanley Burke, picking his way amid the rocks and timbers which obstructed the winding path, again stood before the door of her miserable home. As Stanley came along, with an even stride, and cloak drawn gracefully over his shoulder, you might see that he was dressed with his usual nicety; his hat was of the glossiest, his shirt-collar of the whitest, and he stepped carefully along the miry path, to avoid soiling his well-polished boots with mud. A well-dressed gentleman taking a walk in the rural districts to collect his rents, or to take a mouthful of fresh air, was (or seemed to be) Mr. Stanley Burke. He smiled often, revealing his ivory teeth, and yet his face was a little haggard, his eyes feverish in their restless twinkle, as though he had not slept well on the previous night. At the door of Margaret's miserable home he paused and looked around. A November sun, shining over a bank of dreary, leaden clouds, that were piled up in the west, over the Hudson heights —crowned with farm-house or country seat, appearing among leafless trees— gave its light to a cheerless, wintry scene, in the midst of which the Hudson rolled and glittered with a broad belt of sunshine on its waves. Stanley's eye was not much taken by the grand, sullen beauty of the scene; it simply traversed the space between him and the river—an open space, broken with rocks, bounded on the north by a deserted country-seat, and on the south by a cluster of leafless trees, which rose bare and bleak against the river and the sky. Stanley's glance was quick, searching and nervous, as his eye traversed this space, but no spoken word betrayed the real nature of his thoughts. “Well, and now for my pet!” He pushed open the door, and entered the bleak room, over whose naked floor the declining sunshine redly fell. An oath burst from his lips. The room, at all times bare enough, was now without stove, table, chair or furniture of any kind. Stanley hurried into the next room, and pushed open the closed shutters. The bed had disappeared; it was completely stripped of the miserable furniture which it had held yesterday. “Escaped, by —!” cried Stanley Burke; and then followed a torrent of curses; and then Stanley stood silent in the centre of the room, buried in thought. Where had Margaret gone? Could Harry Morgan have taken her from this miserable place? It was after a long pause that Stanley walked cautiously up and down the deserted rooms, carefully peering into every nook and corner. “It is not here,” he said at length. “I must have dropped it in some other place.” And presently went slowly from the house. You may watch him as he goes; and, as his shadow is thrown long and black over the rocks, you may notice that his head is turned over his shoulder toward the river, until he is out of sight. The next three were busy weeks with Mr. Burke. He searched for Margaret in every nook and corner of New-York, and of the adjacent cities, but in vain. By a fortunate speculation, he came into possession of a considerable sum of money; paid off some debts; removed from his single apartment to an elegantly furnished mansion farther up town; appeared often in Wall-street, seeming like a man possessed in every fibre with the insatiate devil of stock speculation; and once or twice gave “splendid” evening parties to a select number of friends at his new residence. Could he have discovered Margaret's retreat, he could have been quite at ease. And as to Harry Morgan. Where was Harry Morgan? Stanley never met him in his walks. But New-York is a large city, and you can easily lose sight of a man there. Of course, while the three weeks passed away, many things took place, such as murders, suicides, robberies, coroner's inquests, of which Stanley, engaged in business or pleasure, could take no cognizance. He had scarcely time to read the papers. There was an item which caught his eye as he sat one evening in a cushioned chair of the very saloon in which he had first met Harry Morgan; an item which appeared in the closely printed columns of a western paper. And while the barber (one of those gentlemen who speak imperfect English and wear white aprons) was oiling his hair and whiskers Stanley read: “Among the victims of this explosion (the paragraph treated of a steamboat explosion on the Ohio River) was one whose case excites universal sympathy. A young woman dressed in deep mourning, and bearing her babe in her arms, was driven by the flames into the river, and notwithstanding the efforts of a gallant Kentuckian to save her, was drowned. Her body floated ashore, with the dead babe still clutched in the dead mother's arms. From some letters which were found about her person, it appears that her name was Margaret Burke, or Margaret Dunbar; and that, at the time of the accident, she was on her way from New-York to St. Louis.” Stanley was a man of iron nerves, but the paper dropped from his hand. He rose hastily from the chair, and went into a part of the saloon where the gas-light did not shine so brightly. As he stood arranging his cravat before a mirror, he was startled by the sudden pallor of his face. “D—n her, she's gone, anyhow! But what was she doing west? What put it into her head to go to St. Louis?” Hastily assuming his hat and cloak, he left the saloon, and hurried homeward, muttering oftentime,—“Well! she is out of the way, anyhow!” A few days after this, Stanley gave a supper to a few select friends, whom he assembled in a cozy back room of his new residence. Supper being over, and the cloth removed, the wine was brought in, and from his place at the head of the board Stanley gazed over the faces of his guests, who numbered nine in all. There was a merchant and a lawyer, both staid in aspect, three gentlemen of leisure, dressed in the last agony of fashion, who had known Stanley for years, and had been with him perchance in many a nice enterprise; two real-estate men, from whom he had lately purchased property and paid them cash; and three other persons, well dressed, and having a rich flavor of Wall-street in every word and action. You can see nine such men at any time in Broadway, and it is not worth while to describe them in detail. The room in which they were seated was a pleasant place, warmed by a bright coal fire; just the place for nine men, who feel comfortable, to chat quietly and enjoy their champagne. “Well, gentlemen,” said Stanley, filling his glass—a solitary servant stood near his shoulder—“As I am telling you, I contemplate a southern trip. My estates in Charleston, (into which, as I have told you, I have lately come by the death of my uncle,) need looking after. Possibly, I may go as far south as New-Orleans—” “Well! here's success to you where-ever you go!” interrupted one of the gentlemen of leisure, and drained his glass, the rest of the company chorusing the sentiment. “And when I come back”—continued Stanley, holding a brimming glass of champagne before his eyes—“And when I come back —” His sentence was broken by the abrupt opening of the door. And to the great astonishment of the company a lady entered—a lady very pale in face and clad in black, as if in mourning for a dead husband. The sight, which simply astonished the company, paralyzed Stanley Burke. “By —! my wife!” he ejaculated, and made a movement as if about to rise from his chair, but fell back again. And a silence like death prevailed as the lady advanced, and, resting her hand upon the back of a chair, stood like a ghost, in her dark apparel and pale face, in the centre of that festival scene. “I wish to speak with you—alone, Mr. Burke!” said the lady in a low voice. And as she spoke, over the dark dress which she wore—upon her bosom, whose heavings were perceptible—a gold chain, curiously fashioned, of the pure ore, glittered in the light. Stanley's gaze was riveted to that chain. But he made a desperate effort to recover his composure. “My wife, Mrs. Burke, gentlemen,” he said, rising from his chair, and scarcely aware of the words which fell from his lips. “My wife, Mrs. Burke, gentlemen —” and his face was white and scarlet by turns. The lady, without changing her position, said in a calm, even voice, “Mr. Burke, I wish to speak with you alone,” and the gold chain, as she spoke, glittered into light with every throb of her bosom. In a confused way, Stanley begged the gentlemen to excuse him for a few moments; and then followed the lady from the supper room down stairs into the parlor, where a solitary lamp was burning. It was not until he stood in that parlor, whose glaring furniture, rich carpet, massive mirrors, luxurious sofas—all had a gloomy look in the dim light—that Stanley could recover even a portion of his usual presence of mind. Margaret, whom he had thought of as dead—dead with her dead babe still clutched in her arms—now stood before him, living, yet still looking very much like a dead woman. Her black dress made her face seem even more unnaturally pale, and her eyes shone with a steady, clear, yet feverish light. It was Margaret, but she was indeed sadly changed. She did not take a seat, but confronted Stanley, who, for once in his life terribly agitated, could not take his gaze from her face. “I thought you were dead!”—hesitated Stanley. “The fact is, I saw it in the papers—” “The papers told only a part of the truth,” replied Margaret. “As you see. I am not dead, but living. I have just arrived from the West. I wish to say a few words to you. The papers, as you know, tell a great many falsehoods, but sometimes tell hard truths, although in a mysterious shape. Now, can you tell me, what truth there is in this paragraph?” And she placed in Stanley's hands a newspaper which contained the paragraph with which we commenced this sketch, and which we now quote again: “Yesterday evening, the body of an unknown man, entirely divested of clothing, was found floating in the North River, Pier No. —. His hair was dark, and he appeared to be about thirty years of age. There was no mark upon him to indicate that he came to his death by violence, save, indeed, an abrasion of the skin on the right temple, evidently the result of contact with some object floating in the river. The coroner investigated the matter thoroughly; and the jury returned a verdict that the body of the unknown had been thrown into the river by resurrectionists. It was, after the inquest, properly interred in Potter's Field.” Stanley took the paper, glanced over the paragraph—his hand shook a little— but all at once his gaze recovered its usual steadiness. “Well, Madam! what of this?” he said, quite calmly, handing back the paper with a gleam of the old wickedness in his look. “That paragraph may be true, or may not be true. I know nothing about it.” Margaret with her eyes fixed on him, replied, “But the dead man of whom the paragraph speaks—do you know anything about him? The `abrasion of the skin on the right temple' not the result of contact with some object floating in the river, but the result of a blow from a slung-shot or loaded cane wielded by an assassin's hand—do you know anything about that?” As she spoke Margaret advanced, and Stanley fell back a single step. Stanley was pale, but the malignity of the master fiend burned in his eyes. His hand was clenched; he grated his teeth. “And,” said Margaret, as, with that pale face and lifted finger, she advanced yet nearer to the enraged but shrinking man—“And do you know anything about the assassin himself—the assassin who followed his victim, when that victim, mistaking his way in the darkness, wandered towards the river, followed him even to the water's edge, and in the dark crept close to him, and without warning struck him one strong and fatal blow?— the assassin who, when he found his victim dead at his feet, rifled him of everything that was valuable, made his clothes into a bundle, to which he attached a heavy stone, and then flung clothes and corpse into the river?” Stanley retreated another step, but did not reply; his clenched hands and eyes, lit with infernal light, looked as though he was about to spring upon and throttle the woman before him. “The assassin who, with the atmosphere of murder all about him, and the livid mark which the murdered man, in one brief struggle for his life, had printed on his hand, came to the home of his victim's wife, and dared to pollute her with his kiss, and, as she struggled in his grasp, dropped on the floor a gold chain which he had rifled from the dead. This”—her eyes flashed, and she lifted the chain which hung upon her breast. “This gold chain! Do you know anything of this, assassin? Or do you know anything of a poor laboring man who chanced to be wandering on the river shore at the fatal hour; who came upon the murderer as he was engaged in rifling the dead; who, even in the dim light of that autumn night, saw the body hurled into the river, himself all the while very near, but unperceived—and who silently traced the murderer to my home; and then, through the city, to the murderer's own residence, where he charged him with the crime, and was, by a large sum of gold, induced to swear that, on the morrow, he would leave New-York for ever? Do you know anything of this witness, sir?” The rage which had convulsed Stanley Burke for the last five minutes now broke forth in words. A man of greater muscular power, he now advanced upon her with clenched hands, and his small eyes flashing, and expanding in their sockets. “You are not a woman, but a devil!” he said in a low voice. “You have seen this man—this Hoffman—but I'll yet foil you—even if I have to —” His look alone completed the sentence. There was murder in his eyes. He sprang upon the brave, pale woman, with all the ferocity of his brutal nature—but a strong arm intervened, and a form as muscular as his own, was suddenly interposed between him and Margaret. “I took your money, but there was blood upon it, and as soon as a few little matters are settled, you can have it back. Don't strike that gal! You struck a man once, not long ago, behind his back— strike me to the face, now, if you dare!” It was a rough but manly face, and the speaker was the “poor laboring man,” of whom Margaret had spoken rudely clad in work-day apparel, but with a muscular frame, hands hardened and knotted by labor, and a sunburnt face, overspread with wrinkles, the result not of time, but of hard work. At sight of him, Stanley staggered back; and, in his surprise, suffered these words to escape him: “I thought you were in St. Louis—in the West—anywhere but in New-York! How came you back? You swore to me —” But Margaret, leaning her hand on the arm of Hoffman, now spoke. “When I fled from my miserable home, I sought refuge with a poor woman in the neighborhood. Her husband had left that morn'ng for the West. And it was from this woman that I wrung the secret of the husband's departure, which he had told her the moment before he left, torn as he was by conflicting emotions. I need not tell you that she was the wife of this witness; nor relate how, with my child in my arms, and with means derived from the sale of a portion of this gold chain, I followed him—found him, and induced him to return. And now, I am here; my only purpose—she spoke with a changing countenance and violent effort—“to consign to justice the man who is at the same time the murderer of my husband and the father of my child.” The strong excitement which had upheld Margaret for the last half hour now broke down all at once, and overcome by the violence of her emotions—say her anguish—she dropped immediately to the floor. Hoffman, the rude working man, caught her up and bore her to the sofa, and in that moment Stanley Burke hurried to the door, opened it, and closed it, crossed the threshold, and locked the door after him. Then seizing his hat and cloak, which hung upon a rack in the hall, he—with a face corrugated and livid with despair—went with an uneven step from the house, purchased with his ill-got gold, into the cold, bleak wintry night. What emotions filled the breast; what purposes thronged the brain of this bad, desperate man, as he thus hurried forth, no mortal man can ever certainly know. Had he given up the battle as lost, irrevocably lost, or was there yet some new game to be played, some new crime to be committed, in order to patch up the bloody record of the past? Or had the brain of the strong, bad, cunning man, been bewildered by the apparitions which had started up suddenly on his path? No pen can picture, no mortal can ever know, the thoughts of this man as thus he went forth alone into the night. Meanwhile, his guests up stairs much wondered at his long absence. “Strange!” cried one. “Odd!” another. “Queer!” a third. And then they drank, and there was a long pause followed by another chorus of ejaculations, and another round of champagne. “Strange! odd! queer!” but still the host did not return. The guests waited for him deep into the night, and sacrificed themselves in the effort to exhaust his champagne; and at last, very much exhausted, and in some degree drunk— no Stanley Burke appearing—they hurried on their cloaks and overcoats, and went on their various ways surlily home. Meanwhile, what of Margaret? Awaking from her swoon, and discovering that Burke had indeed left the house, she took the arm of Hoffman, and went with him to the humble home of himself and wife; and fevered and sleepless upon a miserable bed—her child, which was also Stanley's child, sleeping beside her—this woman, the real owner of Henry Morgan's wealth—of Stanley Burke's grand house—muttered in her half-delirious dreams the words “to-morrow! to-morrow!” The night passed on, and passed away, and yet Stanly Burke had not returned to his mansion. But a morning paper had this brief item: “At a late hour last night, a person respectably dressed, in attempting to spring upon one of the Jersey City ferry-boats, just as it was leaving the bridge, missed the boat and fell into the river. The night was dark and stormy, and the efforts made to save him were unavailing. He was not rescued from the waves until the “spark of life had fled.” His body was taken charge of by coroner —. We were not able to obtain the name of the unfortunate man. He was dressed in black, and wore a Spanish cloak, lined with velvet; and a gold watch and diamond pin, together with a pocket-book, containing bank-notes and gold to the amount of ?500, were found upon his person. The body will no doubt to-day be recognized and handed over to his friends.” And that was the last of Stanly Burke. For it was Stanley Burke who, by accident or with the idea of self-murder, had met his death in the river which only a month before had received the body of his victim. Here our sketch comes to a close. Who buried the unfortunate man! who came into possession of his estate! (in reality the estate of Morgan) what became of Margaret? are matters upon which it is not well to speak plainly, as the most important events which are detailed in this narrative are of recent occurrence. —On some sunny day when Broadway is thronged with a current of fashion, youth and beauty, (and, for that matter, rags, old age and ugliness too,) when the sky is full of spring, and the spire of old Trinity rises clearly into the cloudless blue, you may note among the crowd of faces a woman who is dressed in mourning; that face, framed in a dark bonnet, wears yet upon its colorless cheek, and in its large feverish eyes, some traces of early loveliness, but it is stamped with the inevitable prophecy of a death by consumption, of a broken heart, of an untimely grave. Alas!—would we might conclude with some words of good cheer! but the truth affords us only this,—Alas! poor Margaret Dunbar! END OF MARGARET DUNBAR</field>
