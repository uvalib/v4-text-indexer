      <field name="fulltext">LEISLER. CHAPTER I. DESERTION OF THE CITADEL OF YORK. Bits of history in a novel, especially at the outset, we very well know, are by no means relished by novel-readers, who generally like to open at once upon the action of the story. But it is sometimes necessary, particularly when a romance is based upon an interesting historical incident, to lay before the reader a brief outline of the events upon which the tale hangs. It is better, we think, to do this at the outset, in a fair and above-board manner, than open with an interesting scene, and before the reader has got half a dozen pages, smuggle in two or three solid pages of history, through which he must flounder, or take them at a flying leap. We don't like this mode of cheating our friends, so we place our history in the fore-ground, that it may be fairly met at the outset. But we will only detain the reader for a few sentences, prefacing the story with no more than is absolutely necessary to make it intelligibly understood. The scenes of the tale are laid so far back as 1689, when New York, under the name of New Amsterdam, was quite as much a Dutch town as it subsequently became an English one. The reign of the Catholic James II. sowed the seeds of disunion and civil trouble in his province of New York, as well as at home. Resolved to establish the religion of Rome throughout his dominions, he appointed every where in the colonies Roman Catholic governors. New York, in Dongan, had a Catholic governor placed over her, who appointed sub-officers of the same faith. Around him, during his administration, there formed a cabal of men of the Roman religion, who held all the influence of the province in their hands. The Protestant gentlemen of figure, whether English of the Church of England or Dutch of the Reformed Church, were alike deprived of power and consideration, and rendered cyphers in the colony. Roman Catholic influence and power predominated. The administration of the affairs of the province was characterized by a decided and undisguised hostility to the Protestant citizeus, whom the governor and his minions oppressed in every way whereby they could frame an excuse for laying their hands upon them. The least remonstrance on the part of a Protestant was punished with rigor. Among others who suffered for manly resistance to this tyranny was Jacob Leisler, a gentleman of property, a merchant of influence and wealth, who owned many ships, and who, by his enterprize and intelligence, was founder of that vast commerce of New York, which now extends its wings over every sea of the globe. For an act of firm resistance to the injustice of the governor, he was thrown into prison, where he was long detained, and heavily fined. These proceedings rendered the government of the Roman Catholic rulers in the province hateful in the eyes of the Protestants, both English and Dutch, and among the poor as well as the rich. This state of things continued until Dongan, for fear of an insurrection, and alarmed for his life, surrendered his authority into the hands of Nicholson, his lieutenant-governor, and retired on board a ship in the harbor. But the people derived no benefit by this resignation. It was one tyrant exchanged for another. At length Andross, who held under King James the government of New England, was deposed by a successful rebellion at Boston, where had been the principal seat of a despotism of a similar character. He was imprisoned by the indignant colonists with his notorious agent, Randolph. Nicholson, hearing of this revolution and overthrow of Andross, began to tremble for his own; for a rumor reached him with the alarming intelligence that the people of England were about to rise and dethrone his master, James II., and offer the crown of England to William, Prince of Orange. This news filled the Protestant inhabitants of New York with great joy, and they began to take courage and unite themselves secretly for the purpose of following the example set them in Boston. Nicholson, suspecting this combination, threw himself into the fort; when a vessel arriving, brought the news of the invasion of England by the Prince of Orange, and the accession of William and Mary to the throne. The citizens at once waited upon him and desired to know whether he would recognize the authority of the Protestant King and Queen. But this he absolutely refused to do; and becoming alarmed at the stern excitement of the people, and remembering the fate of Andross, he embarked from the fort in the night, and rowed on board a ship, thus deserting his government. The next morning early the rumor of the departure of the lieutenant-governor spread throughout the town, and the bells were rang to call the people together.— They assembled soon to the number of several hundreds in an open place between the Trinity Church and the Fort. To a man they were Protestants, the Roman Catholics keeping their houses, and some of them, who were the chief men under Nicholson, hiding themselves.— How the rumor got about that the governor had fled no one knew, nor could any one say who had ordered the bells to be rung. But joy and animation were upon every face; and though the people were assembled in this sudden and apparently tumultuous manner, without a leader, there was the utmost order prevailing. Each man looked to his neighbour for the confirmation of the truth of the words that were still flying through the streets, and which the church bells, in tongues almost as articulate as the voices of men, were proclaiming: `The Papist has fled! Long live William and Mary!' These were the words commingled with the loud clangor of bells, that broke upon the stillness of the morning repose of the town and started every man from his bed; the protestant to clothe and arm himself and hasten to the Parade above the fort; the Catholic to bar his doors and await in silence the issue. At length, when the multitude had as sembled and each was looking round for a speaker or some master spirit of the hour, a tall, well-built gentleman, in a plain olive-brown velvet coat, very white powdered hair and about forty six years of age, stood up above their heads on a broken gun-carriage which lay upon the parade. There was an air of respectability in his appearance, and his mouth and brow indicated firmness combined with benevolence of character. His eye was sparkling with animation, and his cheek flushed as he gazed around for a moment upon the sea of heads beneath him. `Jacob Leisler! Jacob Leisler!' shouted a hundred voices as soon as he was discovered. His name was then repeated from lip to lip in tones of satisfaction which clearly showed, that in that moment of disorganization each man of them looked to him with confidence as one to advise and guide them. The scene was singularly exciting. At least four thousand men, young and old, were condensed within a space which just contained them. Lesiler towered above the slender spire of Old Trinity chapel, the beams of the rising sun just gilding its vane. On the left flowed the majestic Hudson, shining like a mirror, and beyond spread the woodland and green shores of Jersey. North, extended Broadway, in the direction of the Park, which was then a common surrounded by woodland. East of him ran Wall street to the water side, nearly every house in it having shade trees before it and a stoope before the door. In the rear of the south row of houses, was still visible part of the ancient wall, which had been once the northern limits of the town. South of him, about a musket shot distant from where the battery now is, was the Fort, a strong word for that day, formidable with cannon couching in embrazures and and pointing towards the parade, filled with the multitude. In the windows and upon the roofs of the dwellings overlooking the square were women and children, almost equalling in numbers their husbands and fathers that thronged the area. `My friends and fellow citizens,' began Leisler, as soon as the enthusiasm which hailed his sppearance had given way to a deep, listening silence, `you have been called together by the sound of bells and cries that Nicholson has fled to a ship in the harbor. Some of you about me doubt the good news—it is in my power to confirm it—it was by my command that the bells were rung to call you together.— About an hour ago, or little less I received at my house a messenger from Robert Logan, the nephew of the late Governor and Secretary to Nichelson, a young man whom you all full well know, informing me that the Lieutenant Governor had taken a boat and vacated the government, leaving the fortress in his command, he refusing to go.' `The letter! Read us the letter!' cried several voices from different qurrters of the parade. Jacob Leisler then unfolded the letter and gave it a young man near him saiying `Read it! It is too complimentary for me to give it voice!' In a loud and distinct tone the young man, who was short and fat, and who had been a burgomaster, read as follows: Fort York, May, 1689. Sir: Knowing that you possess no little influence and the confidence of the Protestant citizens, and believing that a communication to you will be the same as to them in the aggregate, I proceed to inform you that Lieutenant Colonel Nictolson; late acting Governor of this Province, under a commission from King James II, having refused to acknowledge the authority of William, the Prince of Orange, has seen fit to abdicate his government. He has this night past embarked on board a Swedish ship now in the harbor, and will sail at once for Europe. It was his desire that I should accompany him; but as it does not suit my purposes to quit the Province just now, I remain. Now herewith I propose to surrender the post and all appertaining to it to you, for the sum of ten thousand pounds; otherwise I shall defend it with the soldiers that are in it, against you and yours to to the last extremity. Yours respectfully Robert Logan. P S. I shall give you until noon to decide whether you will save blood-sheding or no.' When this letter had been read there was a deep murmur heard throughout the multitude; a murmur of mingled surprise and disapprobation. `It is like that mad-cap, Robert Logan,' said one. `Nicholson is surely gone,' remarked another, with satisfaction. `Yes,' said a third, `the province is free of the Papist and Pope. Long live William and Mary!' `Long live the king and queen!' shouted a thousand voices as the confirmation of their freedom from papal tyranny was full received into their minds. `No money! not a penny! Down with the myrmidons of James. We will give them steel instead of gold,' cried others. `No, no; let us hear what Jacob Leis ler has to say,' suggested some more moderate among the crowd. `See he is about to speak to us!' `Aye, aye! He is a good man and true. We will hear him.' A number of the principal protestant gentlemen present now called on Mr. Lesiler to advise them what course it was expedient to take, now that the Province was literally without government; and although there was the same mayor and city officers and city government, which held office under Nicholson and Dongan, yet so sudden had been this popular movement that they had no sooner heard in their houses the commotion without, than they feared to stir forth out of their doors. `I am but a private citizen, my friends,' answered Leisler. `I am not capable of advising you in a crisis like the present. As soon as I got this letter from Mr. Logan, I sent to give notice to the town by the ringing of bells, as much for rejoicing at the departure of Governor Nicholson after Dongan as to get you together speedily. Having done this and read to you the letter, I leave you to take such measures as you deem expedient. You shall have my voice, like that of another, in your deliberations!' `There is no one so capable of advising or guiding us in this emergency as Jacob Leisler,' was the cry of all within hearing of his voice. `I am willing to do what I can to serve you,' he answered as if shrinking from assuming the responsibility at such a time. `My advice is that the young gentleman, Mr Logan be waited on by a deputation of the citizens, and required to surrender the fort without any conditions, but granting him his liberty and that of the soldiers, disarming them, however, so that they may do no mischief.— It is probable that the soldiers will be ready to acknowledge the new reign, as they live by the crown whatsoever head it be upon.' This adivce was well received by the people; and a deputation consisting of seven citizens was despatched to the gate of the fort, and demanded audience with Robert Logan. This person appeared over the gate-way and looking down upon them, inquired who they were and what they desired. He was a gay young man, not more than six or seven and twenty, of good figure and face, richly dressed, with a sword by his side and two pistols in his belt. His face wore a reckless, fearless air, as if he defied the burghesses and all the power they could bring against him; though he had not seventy soldiers with him to hold the fortress. `We are come hither, master Roberts Logan,' said the chief man of the deputation, a stout Dutch linen-draper of substance, `to requires you for to surrenders the vort midout delays!' `Do you bring ten thousand pounds in your pouch, Mynheer Van Vow?' asked Robert Logan. `We bring notings but what I said,' answered the citizen flushed at the coolness of the young Englishman. `Then I shall keep the fort. Where is Leisler?' `Mr. Leisler is on the green amongs the peoples,' answered another of the deputation. `Send him hither! He is your chief man, and I will confer with him.' `Mister Jacob Leisler has now no powers to speaks with you,' responded Mynheer Van Vow. `We are sent by the peoples!' `Then go back, Mynheer, to the peoples, and tell them that I will treat with no other man than Jacob Leisler!' This was spoken in a very peremptory way, and the Dutch committee saw that their only course was to obey. So they walked back to the `peoples' and reported the issue of their mission. Thereupon, after considerable warmth of debate between the English citizens and Dutch citizens present, the former proposing to attack the fort and carry it by storm without delay, and hang Logan over the gateway, the latter advocating forboarance, Jacob Leslier was sent alone. Upon arriving at the gate, Robert Logan, instead of addressing him from the platform above it, came down and opened it to him, inviting him to enter. `Nay, sir, I am safer outside, good Master Logan,' answered the merchant smiling. `Do not fear treachery from me, sir! But as you will not go in, I will speak with you outside as we walk up and down!' So together, side by side they paced to and fro a small paved space in front of the gate being about ten feet distant from it; and that he might not be overheard, Logan bade the sentry to step within the wicket. All this was seen from the parade, and there was no little wonder manifested at this boldness of the young man, and curiosity to know what he could propose to their rich townsman. `You received my note this morning, Mr. Leisler?' observed Logan. `Yes,' answered the merchant firmly; `and on receiving kept not the news five minutes. Thus, you see, I was resolved to be no secret correspondent of yours. I set the bells a-ringing, and have, as you see, got the town together!' `You have been diligent;' answered the young man, with a sneer. `What said the people to my proposition, if you read it to them, as doubtless you did, for I saw something like a letter in your hand?' `They scorn your proposal, sir! In a word, Mr. Logan, you are getting to yourself little credit for presuming to maintain this fort after it has been abandoned by the lawful Governor of the Province. You have not the least shadow of authority by which to hold it. In my eyes, in the eyes of the citizens—and you will be in the King's, when he hears of this day's work—a rebel and pirate!' `Your Orange King's authority has not yet reached here. The provincial government under James is terminated. Until fresh authority and powers arrive I have as much right to hold this fort as you or any other man!' `There is some plausibility in this reasoning; but we should hold it for King William, you for a fallen and dead power!' `No, I hold it for the Pope!' answered the young man emphatically. Leisler turned and surveyed his face with astonishment, to see if he were in jest or earnest. But he could not decide, for Robert Logan's countenance was immoveable. `For the Pope?' `Yes, sir. I nor no other son of the church has power to surrender a stronghold, encharged to us by a good Catholic monarch, without the Pope's permission. But hear me, sir! I have not sent for you to argue, but to propose.' `You need not expect any money, sir.' `Nor do I wish it, if I can get what is dearer to you than money.' `What can you speak of that is dearer to me than money?' demanded Jacob Leisler, with surprise. `Your fair daughter, Bertha,' answered Logan, impressing and fixing his keen bright eye upon the face of the wealthy citizen. He saw that it deepened to a flush of anger and amazement, and that his words had both alarmed and displeased. `My daughter, Mr. Logan!' `Yes, sir. I have often seen her trip ping by your side to conventicle, and the glances of her love-warm eyes have melted my bosom.' `What! hast thou spoken with Bertha?' asked the merchant, with anxious suspicion. `No, save as I have said, with the eyes. In this way we have discoursed.' `God forbid! Did she look kindly upon thee?' `Stealthily and curiously only, as maidens are wont to regard a young gentleman above them in degree.' `If she is beneath thee, it little does thee honor to seek to get her graces.' `Nor have I done so. I have worshipped her only afar off. Now I know not what favor the fair Bertha might bestow upon my suit; but I love her with all my heart? and I have sent for you to say that I will surrender the fort into your hands if you will promise to give me your influence with your sweet daughter.' `No, Master Logan. My daughter cannot love, neither can she marry a Papist. You ask what I will never assent to. Besides, I intend to betroth her to Slems Van Vow, the young Burgomaster!' `It would be to cast a pearl before a hog, Mr. Leisler! She can never love such a lump of vanity and fat as that rich young Mynheer Slems!' `Bertha already favors him; at least he says so.' `He is a braggart. If a maiden but look and laugh at him, as every sensible maid would do, he forthwith takes it for a sign of love. He has not wit enough to know when he is made a fool of.' `I did not come hither,' answered Jacob Leisler, looking as if he did not relish this free way of discussing his proposed son-in-law,—`to talk about the burgomaster, but to know whether you intend to surrender the fort without more delay.' `I have told you my terms. Nothing less than your daughter!' `I would sooner see you and your fort blown into the air,' answered Jacob Leisler indignantly. `Very well; then I shall consider that if I win the fair Bertha after this fair warning to you that I love her, that you will have no cause of complaint; so, good Sir Merchant, keep a sharp eye on your pretty daughter, and make Slems Van Vow the watch-dog. If you refuse her to me fairly, I will take her in spite of thee!' `Do you menace me, sir!' `No; I but tell thee a secret.' `Do you yield the fort?' `No!' `Shall I bear this message to the citizens?' `Yes,' answered Logan, turning to reenter the gateway of the citadel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fort York, May, 1689. Sir: Knowing that you possess no little influence and the confidence of the Protestant citizens, and believing that a communication to you will be the same as to them in the aggregate, I proceed to inform you that Lieutenant Colonel Nictolson; late acting Governor of this Province, under a commission from King James II, having refused to acknowledge the authority of William, the Prince of Orange, has seen fit to abdicate his government. He has this night past embarked on board a Swedish ship now in the harbor, and will sail at once for Europe. It was his desire that I should accompany him; but as it does not suit my purposes to quit the Province just now, I remain. Now herewith I propose to surrender the post and all appertaining to it to you, for the sum of ten thousand pounds; otherwise I shall defend it with the soldiers that are in it, against you and yours to to the last extremity. Yours respectfully Robert Logan. P S. I shall give you until noon to decide whether you will save blood-sheding or no.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. THE SURRENDER AND POSSESSION. Upon approaching the gate Logan saw, to his surprise, that it had been closed from within during his conversation with Jacob Leisler. The suspicion that it might have been done purposely by some traitors flashed upon his mind. But he resolved to ascertain without betraying his suspicions, and striking upon the gate, he cried, `Come, my masters, open and admit me. Don't you see my interview is ended?' `Aye, we see that, Captain Robert,' responded a man showing his face at a little slide four inches square which he opened at the side of the door; `we see that your interview has ended, and so has your command here!' `How so, fellow?' he demanded, turning pale. `What means this jest? Open, Sergeant Graff, and let me in!' `No, no, master. We know when we are wise! We have no notion of bein' cooped up here to be besieged, and by and by starved to death or hung. We serve the king whoever he is. It is from the crown's purse that our pay and the money comes that buys our rations. So we have resolved, seeing we have you on the outside, to keep you there and give up the fort. Come, comrades, let us shout for William and Mary!' A loud huzza rose from the bosom of the fortress in answer to his call. Thrice it rent the air, and then three pieces of cannon were discharged by some of the more enthusiastic of the soldiers, the reverberation shaking the town. Fortunately they were elevated so that the shot passed high above the heads of the crowd and did no mischief save among the trees in the woods north of the city. The people, who were too far off to know the reason of the shouting, and yet believing that it was for William and Mary, and hearing the shot roar above their heads were thrown into the wildest confusion; a part rushing towards the fort with cries of vengeance, others flying into the side streets to escape the effects of any further shot from this summary cannonading. Jacob Leisler had not got so far from the gate of the fort after he parted from Logan but that he distinctly heard and understood all that passed between him and the sergeant.. He stopped, therefore, with surprise, to await the issne; and it was with no little joy that he witnessed the firm resolution of the stout man at arms to refuse admittance to his unqualified commander. As the shouts and hurrahs burst upon the air his heart leaped with joyful emotion, and his three-cornered hat waved in the air with zeal. Looking at Logan he saw that he stood by the gate amazed, yet with a look of determined courage. He was advancing towards him when the discharge of the cannon from the embrasures directly above his head and the shouts of alarm and rage from the people on the green arrested him. He caught the meaning of their words as they came down upon the fort with brandished arms and cries of revenge. For an instant he hesitated whether to follow his original intention of arresting Logan or turn back the multitude. But as he saw them close at hand, and fearing the worst from their misconception of the state of things he hastened towards them, gesticulating and calling to them. `Hold, citizens! You are in error! The shouts and firing were for William and Mary! The fort has surrendered!' These words were comprehended by the persons in advance of their fellows, who checked their course, repeating them to those behind till the whole mass echoed the cry and came to a full stand. Jacob Leisler who stood elevated upon the low glacis in front of the fort, so that he could see over their heads, made a sign that he wished to be heard. A deep silence followed the late uproar, like a calm after the hoarse howling of the tempestuous sea. `Citizens, the firing and shouts which you fancied were hostile were for the crown. The guns were unfortunately shotted, but no mischief, I trust, has been done. The fort has submitted to a man voluntarily; for while I was listening to terms from Robert Logan, as you saw, they closed the gate upon him and refused to admit him again; and to show their sincerity, they shouted for the Prince. Now, my friends, we will take quiet possession of the fort, letting such of the soldiers remain as see fit; the rest shall be deprived of their arms and follow such civil pursuits as they shall choose. We will select from our number fifty good men and true, and with them man and maintain the citadel. We will then be guided as wisdom and prudence dictate, as to the further disposition of the government, until a commissioned governor arrives from England with full authority.' This address was received by the multitude with decided approbation. A mah who had been in the rear now forced himself in advance and called out, `True ant honest protestants, which are, I doubt not all ov you who hear me, you have heard our goot Mynheer Jacop Leslier what he haf said. You shout that what he says is goot! Now I make a motion tat we gif him te commands ov te fort wit fifty mens to keep it. `We could not have better mens,' resounded a large number of voices. `We will have Jacob Leisler to be our captain general.' `Our governor!' shouted a little Slems Van Vow, who had before spoken; `he should pe our governor! we cannot have a petter.' `No, no!' answered Jacob Leisler, completely taken by surprise. `No, no, good friends; I cannot be your governor; I am willing to take the fort with fifty citizens and keep it for the governor that shall be sent, and so protect it from the hands of the papists, who, if they should get it into their possession, may do us a mischief. If fifty brave men will now come out from among you, I will readily take possession of the fort, letting the soldiers who have so freely surrendered it go their own way.' `With the exception of catholics!' called out the fat young burgomaster. `Aye, aye, let no catholic go free,' was the response of the mass of the people. `I will do what is just and right,' answered Leisler, who, in spite of himself found himself most reluctantly assuming a responsibility for which neither his mercantile habits nor his energy of character fitted him. Yet all men seemed, as by one voice, to fix upon him as the only man suited to take the lead in such an emergency. Although, it did not occur to him, at the moment, yet his accepting the command of the fort and therefore of the military force of the Province, was in part assuming the government; for there being no civil administration, he who commanded the soldiery held the reins of power. In fact, the moment he consented to enter and hold the citadel, that moment he was captain general of the colony, at the head of a military government; and a power, too, as truly without authority as that which Robert Logan had taken into his hands. The fifty men, armed and ready to obey, were soon chosen from the citizens and drawn up by the merchant-soldier, in front of the fortress. He now, for the first time, bethought himself of Logan, from whom his attention had been diverted by the necessity of checking the advauce of the infuriated populace. But in the excitement of the moment Logan, seeing the danger of his situation, and aware that he had not a moment to lose in providing for his personal safety, glided round the angle of the tower within which stood the gate, and darting into the fosse followed it swiftly to its outlet by the shore on the harbor side of the fort. Here he was out of the sight of his enemies whose voices, however, reached his ears. There was a boat lying not far from the mouth of the fosse which he took possession of, and began to pull rapidly out in the direction of the Swedish ship, on board of which were both, the governor and lieutenant governor. But to his surprise, he had not pulled but a few yards from the shore when he saw the ship spread her sails and stand down the harbour. `They have heard the firing and shouting, and the governor's fears have driven him off. Well, let them go,' he said; `I did not intend to sail with them, but only remain on board till this excitement, that has got these folks ashore by the ears, subsides a little. No, no, I can't leave the colony and leave in it the fair Bertha Leisler. The ship sails bravely away! I shall have nothing to do then but to pull into some fisherman's cabin on one of the islands, and there wait the turn of affairs.' He pulled steadily on, his face towards the citadel, which was still partly enveloped in the smoke from the cannon. At intervals the shouts of the populace came clearly across the water, for the air was very light where he was, though in the lower harbour the ship had a five knot breeze. The islands in the harbour of New-York, were not then as at the present day, cultivated and adorned with villas or public edifices, Many of them were wooded, and at a distance were mountainous masses of foliage lifting themselves above the waters of the bay. Some of them were cleared here and there, showing bright spots of verdure or patches of rich brown loam, with a hut near the water.— These were the dwelling places of fishermen; who ran seaward every morning to catch their fish, and returned before noon to dispose of them, still fresh, in the market-place of the town, and by night reaching their island homes again. Towards the north east shore of governor's island Logan pulled his skiff, which was a rude pirogue, constructed from a hollow log, and such as was ordinarily used by the fishermen of the islands. When he first discovered it and got into it he saw that it was one of their boats, and strongly suspected that in taking it, he was keeping the owner in town for the day, or until he could get a passage to the island where he dwelt in some neighbor's canoe. Leaving him to his fortunes for the present, we return to Jacob Leisler, who was not a little amazed and vexed to find that the young man had taken advantage of the confusion to make his escape.— At first he thought he must have been admitted into the fort; and advanced to the gate to ascertain. But to his inquiry, sergeant Graff replied that he knew not he was from his position, he could not see to the right and left of the entrance, and besides, he had been, he said, too much taken up with looking at the angry people coming down upon them, as if to massacre all in the fortress. A search was made by looking this way and that, and peeping into the fosse, but he had escaped; and as the people were clamorous for the gates to be opened, Jacob Leisler gave up the attempt to find him to place him under arrest, which he wished to do to keep him from doing his daughter a mischief; for his words yet rang in his ears. The gates were now thrown open to Leisler and his fifty men, who marched in and took formal possession of the fort by hoisting the British flag and proclaiming William of Orange King of Great Britain, and the lawful ruler of the province of New Amsterdam; for the Dutch citizens gave this name to the colony, while the English invariably gave that of York, which, as well as the English population, at length got the ascendancy and held it. Leisler now ranged the garrison, which consisted of about one hall English soldiers and the other half Dutch, around the interior court-yard of the fort, and took from them their arms and accoutrements, which they gave up, save five or six contumacious fellows, who, being more papal than loyal, resisted the disarming process, which at least twenty more discreet Catholics had wisely and quietly submitted to. They were, however, not only disarmed, but bound and thrown into a keeping-room on the left of the gate, there to remain until they were converted to Orangeism. The process of disarming had hardly got through, before a cry was raised that the Roman Catholics in the city were privately arming, with the intention of retaking the fort. Upon hearing this, Jacob Leisler, who now saw that he was actually invested with the chief and only power of the province, yet almost insensibly as it were, forthwith took upon himself the authority which every man looked to him to assume. He at once, at the suggestion of his proposed son-in-law, sent a detachment of twenty-five men from the fort, and commanded one hundred others, who were outside, and who had arms, to accompany them and traverse every street of the town, and report the state of things. At the head of this detachment he placed the young burgomaster, who wielded a sword full four feet long; a weapon of two great magnitude and weight for him to use, save to inspire terror in his enemies, a ruse very common with cowards, though we do not wish the reader to infer that Mynheer Slems Van Vow was a timid man. Had he been a coward, he would hardly have put himself at the head of this war party. But when the reader is informed that the young burgomaster was well aware that there was no danger, the rumor having been started by himself, on his own account, that he might have an opportunity not only of showing his patriotism, but of exhibiting his military bravery to the fair eyes of Bertha Leisler, whose dwelling he resolved to pass in his march. Slems well knew that he needed some deed of valiance and mark to find favor in her sweet blue eyes; for he was not so dull that he could not comprehend, though obscurely, that the maiden considered him a very great bore. He had had, indeed, for some time past, a hazy notion that she did not think him an individual very much entitled to respect, notwithstanding he had been a burgomaster and was worth money. The detachment marched out of the fortress with an African drummer at the head of the column, playing a merry peal upon the sheep-skin head of his kettledrum. Slems marched up Broadway, and turned down Wall street and into Pearl, and down Maiden lane to the corner of Water street, where he came to a halt in front of a spacious mansion, built of Dutch tiles, and bearing all the the outward marks of an opulent proprietor. This was the abode of Jacob Leisler, the rich merchant, now, as if by magic, elevated to the rule of the province. Through the streets, thus far, no person had been seen, save some women and children, who fled at the spectacle. Not a male was visible, save at the windows, from which scowled many a Papist form upon the military column. No where were discoverable any signs of malcontent. Surprise and dismay seemed to have seized the Roman Catholic population and deprived them of their courage as well as of their political power. What their Protestant suecessors were to decide upon, none of them knew, and each waited in painful suspense the rapid progress of events. What intelligence they got from the scene of the movements of the party was gleaned from lads and females who had ventured as far as the Green, and returned with exaggerated accounts of what was passing. Among these, they were paralyzed by one which declared that every soldier in the fort had been massacred, and Robert Logan hanged. When, at length, the sound of the drum and fife of the armed party of observation, led by Slems Van Vow, fell upon their ears, they apprehended the worst; but when the burgomaster was seen at their head, with his sleek cheeks and capon belly, brandishing his enormous sword, their fears were dissipated; for all who knew Mynheer Slems Van Vow, knew he had the bump of caution too largely developed to trust himself within the sphere of personal peril. When Slems, after patrolling half the town, reached the dwelling of the fair Bertha, he halted his men, and forming them before the house, stood in the front, and taking his sword in both hands with a stout grasp, waved it in token of military homage to her beauty, at least this was his idea. The maiden was at the window, for she had long been watching them with repeated and anxious questioning of every passer-by, touching her father's safety; for with every rumor his name was strangely mingled; but, whether for good or evil to himself she could not comprehend. And although the rattle of the drum, as the armed men turned from Nassau Street into Maiden Lane, startled her, even more than the roar ef the cannon a short time before, yet her apprehensions were allayed by seeing her betrothed burgomaster advancing at the head of the column. A smile spread over her face, which was increased to a merry laugh as she saw with what an air he marched, while yet it was with difficulty he could carry his ponderous sword, which seemed to gall his shoulder, but which from its weight and length could be borne in no other manner. Several young and beautiful maidens, but all less fair than she, were assembled at her house, and were looking forth from the window. When Slems gave his salute Bertha, with a mischeivous laugh, waved her handkerchief, and called upon her companions to do the same. `Welcome, brave burgomaster!' she cried pleasantly, her eyes sparkling with mirthfulness; `what is that thou holdest so firmly in thy two hands?' `A sword, divine Bertha.' `It is a dangerous weapon, they say, in the hands of children. Lest thou shouldst harm thyself or the drummer close behind thee, I would advise thee to wear it in its scabbard.' `Thou art very loving, sweet Bertha,' responded Slems in good, simple faith, `to think so much of my welfare. But fear thee not, I shall be terrible with it only to my enemies.' `What is this great array of men in arms with thee?' she asked seriously, her momentary liveliness yielding to the graver emotions natural at such an hour. `I have been placed at their heads by commands of thy honored father, who is now chief rulers in the province. Hold up thy heads, sweet Bertha, for thou art highers than any maiden in the land!— Verily, Jacobs Leislers is this days even as a Kings among us, and you are a princess. It is to do thee homages I have led my mens in arrays before your dwellings. Fare thee wells!' `Where is my father? Are these rumors true, that he has taken upon himself the chief rulership of the province?' `It is, sweet and adorables Berthas,' responded Slems, waving his sword, or rather attempting this feat, but with such awkward success that he well nigh cut off his own boot, to the great merriment of the boys of the town, who were gazing upon him with equal awe and ridicule. `Then am I sorry, indeed,' said Bertha, not heeding what at another moment would have excited her merriment. Her thoughts were upon her father and his danger. She knew the fearful responsibility of his position in a province where the power of the Catholic party, though subdued for the moment was not annihilated. She seemed, with prophetic eye, to foresee for him, in his new career, evil and danger she dared not let her mind rest upon. `If you are sorrys, divinest and adorables, the province rejoices. Your fathers is the only mans to save us all.' `Alas, he is not fitted for this station. He has not the energy and firmness for such a crisis. Oh, that I had been near to have advised him.' `He did not accept it, celestial eyes,' answered Slems, bowing with gallantry at every other word, `but it was thrust upon him. He could not help it. But it is a great honors to thee and him and me! But I cannot delays here, thou suns of my loves. These are times that trys mens soul. The peace of the city is committed to me, and I must see as nones of the Papists do mischiefs.' With these words Slems called on his followers to march foward; and after parading through the lower streets, they once more entered Wall by the dock and returned to the gate of the fort. Here all was found comparatively quiet. Jacob Leisler had addressed the people and recommended them to retire peacably to their several occupations, which many of the more moderate of the towns-people did do, but the more zealous and restless hung about the fort, talking together and advising many plans for ridding the town of the Papists. But when the burgomaster returned and reported that `not a Papists dared shows his heads out of his windows,' this feeling of vengeance, which had quickened by fear of the Catholics, subsided. Jacob Leisler, who now saw himself so unexpectedly invested with the supreme power, began to act with that firmness which his situation called for. He appointed a suitable number of men for the garrison, and over them placed a captain and lieutenants, English born citizens, who had seen service in Europe. He did this to conciliate the English protestants, who had already began to talk loudly of Dutch monopoly in the new administration of affairs. He also formed from the people five companies, which he armed from the arsenal of the citadel, which were called `train-bands.' These appointed their own captains and officers, and were filled principally by volunteers. The majority composing them were of Dutch extraction. The duty of these train-bands was to parade the streets, guard the town, and overawe the Papists.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER. All these important measures for the safety and defence of the town and Province were carried into execution during the day; thus showing that Jacob Leisler carried to his responsible position an energy and ability that could not have been looked for from a mere merchant. Still he felt that this ability was not so much in himself as forced upon him by the exigencies of the time. He felt that he was inadequate to the high office which had been thrust upon him; and resolved so soon as he placed the affairs of the Province in a safe position, at once to surrender the reins of government to abler and more experienced hands. There were other men in the Province who were every way capable, and perhaps far better fitted for so high a post, than Jacob Leisler. His fitness lay in the fact that he, being a Hollander by birth, represented the great majority of the people, who were of Dutch extraction; and also in his influence as a merchant, his wealth, and his being of the middle class of society, and thus nearer to the people. He had made himself what he was by industry and integrity; and the people felt that he was one of them. There were other Dutch gentlemen of wealth in the Province and in the town, such as the Stuyvesants, the Liv ingstones, the Bayards, the Courtlandts; but they were what were termed `court-men,' that is aristocrats. And besides Courtlandt, who was the Mayor at the time of Nicholson's flight, was a Roman Catholic. The two former, though protestants, were not popular with the masses. Jacob Leisler was therefore the man of their hearts. His elevation, therefore, could not fail to create a third party, headed by these men. Their envy and jealousy were aroused to see a man raised from the middle ranks, with the investure of a power and authority that British noblemen had hitherto held. Hence while Jacob Leisler, yielding to the wishes of the majority, was fortifying his position, and taking measures to keep the province in government, until a commissioned Governor should be sent over by King William, Bayard, Livingston and others, though protestants like himself, and adherents to the King, were secretly assembled in the elegant mansion of Col. Bayard, which was situated amid beautiful gardens facing the Hudson, half a mile north of Trinity Church, and plotting a plan to prevent this accession of a mere merchant to the supreme rule in the province. Ignorant of this conspiracy, Jacob Leisler passed the day in establishing order and the outline of government; and so closely had he given himself to these fatiguing duties that the day had nearly closed before he felt at liberty to quit the citadel and seek his own abode. At length, when he went forth from the fortress for this purpose, the most perfect order prevailed. But few persons were seen on the green, and these perfectly peaceable and without arms; and he even saw several of the Roman Catholic citizens walking abroad; for after he had established order in the town he had issued a proclamation that every Roman Catholic, who would wear upon his hat a yellow ribbon, in token of adherence to the Prince of Orange, should be unmolested, and retain all the privileges of citizenship. Many of the catholics of the humbler class had done this, and in every direction the Orange badge met his eyes, though not in great numbers, but sufficient as he thought to assure him that he would have no serious difficulty with this portion of his fellow citizens.— The more influential portion of the catholics, however, appeared not in the streets, and especially the Mayor Courtlandt and his Council, to whom Leisler, about noon, had sent a formal messenger, courteously calling upon them to acknowledge the authority of William and Mary. To this message Courtlandt sent back a reply in these words: `It is a question whether we should have felt it our duty to recognise a Governor, commissioned by the usurper himself. You will, therefore, not expect us to acknowledge the authority of an usurper under an usurper. We defy your power, and shall resist to the best of our ability.' To this firm refusal to recognise him, Leisler made no other reply than proclaiming amnesty and friendship to every Roman Catholic who would wear the Orange ribbon. This proved to be a sagacious policy; for among the Romans were many whose interests were paramount to their love for the church, and who felt no compunctions of conscience in following the dictates and promptings of the former. Jacob Leisler did not leave the fort to go to his house, where Bertha was anxiously waiting his return, without a suitable body-guard. This consisted of eight men well armed, exclusive of Slems Van Vow, who walked by his side, a belt girded about his waist, or rather across his abdomen, holding a brace of Spanish pistolets, while in his hand was grasped the formidable terror-inspiring foe which had excited the merriment of Bertha Leisler. As the new Captain-General or Governor passed along the streets in the direction of his habitation, he was cordially and respectfully greeted by all passersby, also by the citizens, who, with their families, were gathered at that evening hour upon their stoops. Every man felt that the merchant had taken upon himself the control of affairs wholly to oblige them, and not from any personal ambition. They understood the difficulties of his position, and felt that he should command both their reverence and sympathy, as well as he had won their confidence. The Governor acknowledged the kind respect of his fellow-citizens with a smile, and occasionally stopped to exchange a word with some more substantial citizen, who rose from his stoop to do him honor as he walked by, with his guard tramping behind. As they came near Maiden lane, where he dwelt, a man passed him, and as he did so, jostled Slemns, rudely and rebelliously remarking, that `he would wear no devil's livery to please any man; and he who laid hands upon him would come off the worst.' With these words he was moving on. `That fellow is a Catholic; I well know him,' cried the burgomaster. `Ten men follow him, and seize him and hold him fast till I cut him down for daring to insults the Governor's excellencies, and rub against me, the Governor's sons-in-laws.' Four of the guard were about to turn back after the bold Papist, who was well known to be a fearless, reckless bravo; but Jacob Leisler said calmly, Hold, soldiers! Let him pass on his way. It is better I should receive a few words, than that the peace of the town should be broken, as it will be if there is any collision with the Papists. It becomes us to be moderate and forgiving, if we would sustain our authority.' `But the fellows have now yellows ribbon, most excellent Governors!' cried Slems, looking fiercely after the man, who had stood still a few yards off, and looked back, as if waiting them and defying them. `Peace, Mynheer Burgomaster,' said Jacob Leisler. `That man would not have done this, if he had not others to sustain him at hand. Let it pass. This shows me, however, that we must be on the watch, for the conduct of this man proceeds not from himself, but from instigators.' `Do you thinks so, Governors?' demanded Slens, with alarm. `Yes,' answered the Governor, as they walked forward; `I have no doubt that if I should give orders to arrest that man, that a hundred Catholics would, as it were, rise out of the ground to aid him with their arms.' `Let us quicken our march, good Mynheer Leisler, for it is getting late, and the fair Bertha will weary waiting for you.' With these words the burgomaster walked rapidly forward, looking carefully about him, as if expecting an enemy at every step. Jacob, however, walked at the same pace, and at length came to the door of his mansion. Bertha, who had been standing upon the stoope, eagerly observing him as he approached, and only prevented by maidenly propriety, in the presence of so many men about, from bounding forward to meet him, now threw her arm about his neck and welcomed him with the greatest joy. `Thanks to God, dear father, that I see you home in safety after this day's dangers!' `Heaven bless you, little one!' he said with parental affection, as he return ed her kisses with one upon her bright brow. `And now, Berthas, have you no welcomes for me?' said the burgomaster, smiling with that imperturable self-satisfaction that never deserted him. `Put away that dreadful sword,' she said, with a mischievous light in her mirthful eye. `How can you alarm a maiden with coming near her in such a warlike guise?' `Bless me! I forgots, lovey; for being so used to wars, I knew not that I had it in my hand! I know womens are timid; they have nerves. I have nones. Take this swords, two of you, and keeps it so that none of the boys shall finger it. Stand back, youngsters, and come not so near the excellent Governor's presence. `Now, light of my eyes,' he cried, turning round with his arms extended, as if he would fold his bride elect to his heart; but to his surprise she had vanished into the house, taking her father with her. `Soldiers!' said Slems, in no wise discomfited, and addressing the body-guard, who were a fine-looking set of soldiers, commanded by Sergeant Graff, `you will remains without here untils orders from his excellencys. You will see that no Papist goes past without the Orange ribbons. You will disperse these boys, who seem to have no fear of the great warlike doings that has been done this days, but laughs in the faces of warlikes captains.' With these words the burgomaster entered the house, passing through a file of young girls, the daughters of the principal Dutch citizens in the neighborhood, who, with an indefinable sort of sympathy, had gathered at her house, as if she could extend to them that protection and countenance which her influential father was conferring upon the town and province. Their manner had very much changed towards Bertha since the accession of her father to the supreme rule in the colony had become known. They restrained their former frank familiarity, and kept it under by an air of respect that had no other effect upen her than to make her experience a painful feeling of restraint. The burgomaster also experienced the same sensations of awe when he entered the parlor and beheld Bertha seated by her father's side. He seemed to realise all at once that there sat the Governor of the province and the daughter of the Governor of the province.— Then came the idea that to this daughter of the Governor he, Slems Van Vow, burgomaster, was betrothed in marriage prospective. Hereupon he began to realise fully the dignity of his own elevation as prospective son-in-law to the Governor of the province. With these feelings swelling in his bosom, he entered the room where sat Jacob Leisler and Bertha interchanging alone their grateful congratulations; not upon his elevation, for he coveted it not, and she thought not of it as elevating her above the maidens of the land; for Bertha had no pride nor selfishness. She loved her father with alll her heart, and as cordially despised, if she could despise what she could laugh at, the self-satisfied, vain, and ridiculous fat little burgomaster, to whom her father, with singular and unaccountable weakness was strongly attached and coveted for his son-in-law. To prevent offending, or rather grieving her father, the light hearted maiden received the attentions of the young citizen, making up her mind that she would so demean herself in his presence that he would be happy to cry a-mercy and beg Jacob Leisler to absolve him `from all ambitions towards his daughter.' But Slems was of a composition not easily affected by wit raillery, laughter or ridicule. He had not delicacy of perception sufficient to take or comprehend an inuendo. He never saw a double meaning in words. He was unable to draw an inference the most palpable He stood upon the broad basis of his own low Dutch platform, and saw every thing upon the same level. Every thing was to him as it seemed. Bertha appeared to him to be very much pleased with him, for she laughed at every thing he said, and was always merry in his company. But he was too matter-of-fact to see that he was the cause and object of her mirthfulness; that she looked upon him, not as a dignified lover, as he conceived himself to be, but in the light of an over grown, good-natured poodle, too large to pet yet not too ludicrous in its attempts at puppy antics, to afford amusement. More than a year had the burgomaster been a diligent and devoted suitor of the beautiful maiden, spending every Sunday evening regularly at her house; but always she was sure to be provided with a fun-loving lass from her acquaintance, so that, if we may credit Slems' account, the evenings went off merrilys and wit great pleasurables. Never had she met him alone; and as he was by no means an individual of great courage either in love or war, he doubtless felt it a great relief to have a third person present, to keep him in countenance; for in the end he knew she was to be his vrow, this being a settled matter, and so courting alone was quite a superfluous agitation of his nervous system Every Sunday, therefore, Slems would go to the merchant's, sit the evening and looking at Bertha in that sort of pleased selfish way which a purchaser of a very fine animal who was not to be delivered to him till a certain day, would walk over to gaze by the hour upon it and congratulate himself in his bargain. There is no question but that Slems loved the maiden, so far as he was capable of loving, and that any thing which should prevent the marriage, which was to take place the nineteenth of June, would touch his heart grievously. Jacob Leisler would also take such an event severely, as he felt that Mynheer Van Vrow, though not gifted by nature with extraordinary talents, was a young gentleman of good character, fair temper, and of handsome substance, and better calculated, in his belief, to render his daughter happy through life, than any of the gay gallants of the former royal governor's suit who used to hang around her steps and boldly compliment her upon her beauty. `I congratulates you, fair daughters of the governor,' said Slems as he entered the parlor; and bowing with respect to both. `I feel honored by my intimacys with the familys of such distinguished peoples; I never expected, Mynheer Leisler to be the son-in-law of the ruler of the Province.' `You need not congratulate me, my good burgomaster,' answered Jacob Leisler, `I am, it is true, invested with the power in the land, but until it is confirmed by the new King, I am little better than an usurper. Still the reins must be in some one's hands, and as the citizens have placed them in mine, I do not feel at liberty to lay them down. I shall act for the King to the best of my ability.' `I feel, dear father,' said Bertha, `that this is an unfortunate day for you. I would rather the people had placed the authority in some other hand. You have fierce spirits and bold to contend with already. If rumor speaks the truth, there is, besides the catholics, a strong Protestant party forming against you, headed by the Mayor Courtlandt and colonel Bayard.' `Most brave Governors, give me the authoritys, and I will at once and commands Sergeant Graffs to go and arrests these traitors, and put them into confinements in the citadels. Fear not, lovely Bertha. I will stand between thy father and danger.' `If you stood near him with your sword in your hand, I fear you would do him more harm than his foes,' answered Bertha, with a smile. `We can't take any steps against our own religious friends, though they politically oppose us,' answered the Governor. `We must conciliate. With my consent there shall be no civil broil. Now, good burgomaster, if you will remain without with the guard until I come, you will oblige me, as I desire some private conference with my daughter.' `Allow me to salutes thee, fair Berthas!' said the young burgomaster approaching; `it will inspires me with valors!' `You need no inspiration, Mynheer; you would be dangerous with more courage than you have.' `That is a rare compliments to me. I know I am a brave mans, and all I desires is that I may have some occasions in these bloody times to show you that I can protects beauty.' The burgomaster then bowed as low as his little round paunch would permit, and making a military salute with his hand to the Governor left the room, and walked to the street door. Around it were assembled men and boys in great numbers, some armed, a few having the yellow ribbon in their hats. All were gazing at the house, or at the small guard of soldiers which were drawn up before the door. They were quiet, and only seemed waiting to see their Governor again. A few of the men had swords buckled to their sides, and one or two on the skirts of the crowd leaned upon muskets; for all had not yet returned their arms to the beckets above their mantelpieces, from which they had taken them down in the morning. `Dear father,' said Bertha, as soon as the burgomaster left her alone with him, now that you have restored peace to the town, and established an outline of government do, I implore you, send in at once your resignation.' `To whom shall I send it. There is none in power to receive it.' `To any one. To Col. Bayard; he is a protestant and friend of the new reign.' `True; but he is an English partisan. He and his friends are opposed to the Dutch population. They are, too, in the minority. If I should surrender the authority to him, the people who invested me with it, would wrest it from him by a revolution, and I should be the first victim! No; I can only surrender it to the masses from whom I received it. `Do it at once!' she cried earnestly. `At the risk of anarchy and confusion without parallel. They would perhaps refuse to accept it, for they fairly forced me to assume the power; or if they accepted it it would be to quarrel for the precedency among themselves till riot and misrule would reign. There are, perhaps, certain circumstances, which combined, render me the most suitable person just at this crisis to take this heavy responsibility. I have assumed it, and therefore, I must maintain it, let what be the issue. For wisdom to rule I look to the Ruler over all.' `This is painful.' You will be exposed to the malice of your enemies, both Papal and protestant. But if you feel that it is your duty, and that you can serve your country by continuing in power until a Governor arrives, I will no longer object.' `Thanks, sweet daughter. I feel that to resign now, when all men seem to look to me, would be treacherous.' `Then, sir,' she said, after a moment of reflection, `if such is your decision, I beg you will, without delay, send an ad dress to the throne of William and Mary, acknowleding their power, and submitting yourself to their authority and pleasure. State the circumstances of the revolution of this day, which has thrust the government upon you, and assure their majesties of your loyalty and humble devotion. This step, taken at once will, may be, get you the royal ear and favor in advance of the protestant party headed by Colonel Bayard and Mr. Livingston, who will no doubt send news at once to England, and so represent and color the doings of to-day, that you will be looked upon by the King as a rebel instead of a useful and faithful servant of the crown.' `My daughter, your words are full of wisdom and experience. With such a councillor I shall govern safely. What you say is likely to prove true. My enemies will not let slip the earliest occasion to do me an injury, as you have said. I will prepare it this night and despatch it by the first ship.' `Nay, sir! wait not for a ship to sail from this port. Once a month a ship goes to London from the town of Boston. It lacks but five days to the day of her departure. Bayard will have letters, if not a messenger, in that ship to inform against you. You must have an address on board also.' `It shall be done. I will despatch a private postman on horseback by dawn with my pacquet to the King.' `Oh, that I were a youth, sir; I would not only be its post-bearer but sail with it in the ship, and in person reach the King before all others, and lay it at his feet!' `You are a noble girl, Bertha. The address shall be sent, and by a trusty messenger,' answered her father, with decision.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. THE MESSENGER. `Now, my dear child,' said the merchant-governor, taking by the hand the beautiful girl who had manifested so much forethought and wisdom, `now before going away for the purpose of writing to the King, I wish to say a few words to you in a confidential manner.' `Certainly, dear father,' she answered, looking into his face with surprise at his grave manner; and beginning directly to think that it was some matter touching hastening her union with the burgomaster on account of the troubled state of the times. `Have you ever met with the young secretary, Robert Logan?' He fixed his eyes keenly upon her face as he put the inquiry. She colored and started a little with evident emotion, and then dropping her eyes to the floor upon which her little foot, shod with a velvet slipper was drumming as if it was in quite as much perplexity as its fair mistress: `Yes, sir!' `Where was it?' he continued, not unobservant of her embarrassment. `At the door of the Conventicle in the fort the first time, sir.' `The first time! Have you met him more than once? `I have seen him on my way to conventicle, sir, and he has caught my eye during the prayer, I believe, sir; and he has passed the house when I have been at the window.' `This shows more communion between this young gentleman and you than I believed. Has he had speech of thee ever?' `But once, sir,' was the still downcast answer. `Then he has spoken to you?' `Yes sir, once!' she exclaimed, with very marked emphasis upon the last word. `Where and when?' `It was in the conventicle, sir. He was in the pew behind ours, and my kneeling cushion was gone, which he seeing, bent over and said most civilly and courteously. `Fair maiden kneel upon this,' and therewith, sir, cast his velvet short-cloak down upon the floor before me.' `And did you kneel upon it?' `I was in the act of kneeling upon the hard bricks of the church floor when he did this, and I found myself pressing the cloak before I could recover myself; and besides, sir, it would have been quite a discourtesy to have rejected it, so I kneeled upon it till the prayers were over and, then gave it to him again.' `Did you say anything? `I thanked him, sir.' `And he?' `He said that henceforth it should be sacred to him, and though he was somewhat worse as to his prayers he would not fail three times a day to kneel upon the same cloak and say them! So, sir; if I had refused him,' she added with the least perceptible archness sparkling beneath the soft shadow of her down-falling lids, `I should have missed this occasion of doing his soul a great good.' `Beshrew me, you are very simple or very artful, Bertha,' said her father observing her sternly. But he could discover nothing in her demure sweet looks to confirm any suspicion that had started in his mind that she cared for the young man a groat, or under an air of simplicity, sought to disguise her feelings from him; for Jacob Leisler had good reason from the proposition made to him by Logan, to believe that he knew more of his daughter than he himself had ever dreamed of. There were a few moments of mutual silence, during which Bertha raised her clear full blue eyes, and fixed them calmly and openly upon his face; yet with an air of wonder in them at this catechising. Yet she asked no question, knowing that her father would, if left to himself, unfold all; while a direct inquiry would be sure to place a seal upon his communicativeness. At length the Governor spoke: `And these are all the occasions on which this young gentleman has had speech of you, daughter?' `Yes, sir, I remember none other.' `What think you of him?' `A fair looking gentleman, sir, with a pleasant voice and expressive eyes; and a carriage somewhat noble and free.' `A character more free than noble you might also have said; for he is as gay as a French courtier, and as fanciful in his costume. I am sorry he has ever seen you! You are beneath his degree, for he is a scion of one of England's noblest trees, and will one day become a peer of the realm, if rumor gives it true of him — Such a man hath no business casting his velvet cloaks before a burgher's daughter.' `It was done with kindness, sir!' `I dare say. If he had kissed thy cheek it had been done with kindness.' `Nay, sir, that is too free, even from thee father,' she said with wounded pride, her eye bright with feeling and proper resentment. `I meant not to offend thee; I meant to show that young maids, in their unsuspecting innocence of wrong, look not as they onght upon advances of young men. There was no great harm in this matter of the cloak, so it went no further. But I had rather it had not happened; for he hath presumed upon it.' `In what way, sir? He is too noble to think me an injury, much more do me one.' `There it is! You betray your pleasure at the thoughts of him in every word you utter. Is this beseeming in a maiden betrothed, and whose day is but three weeks off?' `I am sorry, sir, if I have offended.— I meant no harm.' `No, but he has presumed on your kind word, and perhaps the smile with which you acknowledged your obligation to him, to suppose that he can claim an interest in your affections.' `Indeed, sir!' exclaimed the maiden, with a deep blush of pleasurable surprise. `It may well amaze you, for I perceive that he has had no color of ground for his hopes. To-day he sent for me to say, in private, that he was deeply enamoured of my daughter—' `Of me, sir?' `Yes. You may well exclaim, child; and your brow glow with indignation.'— But it was not the flush of anger, but of pleased surprise that mantled her face, as if her cheeks had suddenly become transmuted into roses. `He said that he had often seen you, and that he felt that he could not be happy unless you became his wife; and he furthermore said that he would surrender the fort, if I would surrender you.' `This was bold, sir,' she said, seeing that she must say something, though she would rather not have trusted her voice, lest she should betray how happy she was to hear what he revealed to her, unconscious of the part he was acting in producing in her bosom a reciprocity of sentiment with that of the young secretary, who, truth to tell, had long had a very precious little corner in her heart all to himself, a felicity of which he was altogether ignorant, save so far as her emotion, whenever she met him, betrayed to him her gentle pleasure. From the first six months before, she had caught the fine eyes of the handsome secretary fastened upon her in the conventicle, she had felt both her curiosity and interest awakened in him. Curiosity in a young maiden to know who is the handsome stranger who has been detected fixedly and warmly regarding her, is sure to beget an interest in him when this is satisfied; and interest leads to liking, and liking, if all circumstances move harmoniously together, to love. In this way had interest and kindly feeling towards Robert Logan grown in the young bosom of Bertha Leisler. If, by chance, she did not see him standing in the porch of the conventicle, to gaze upon her as she passed in, she was disappointed; and if he were not at service at all, they passed heavily and unheeded. The little act of gallantry touching the cloak, had deepened emotions that glances hitherto had only created and kept alive. The sound of his low voice, as he uttered the few words across the railing of the pew, thrilled to her heart, and as she moved homeward, her bosom was filled with delight, she hardly knew whence, save only that with it the handsome secretary's form was blended. But still she loved not. A maiden may feel gratitude, interest, and deep regard for a youth, and yet nothing beyond, save he advances. Her heart is only prepared to love; she does not yet love. So it was with Bertha; circumstances only were wanting to make that love which yet had no name, and scarcely a being. `What reply did you make to Mr. —?' she asked, seeing her father some time silent. `That I would not accept the fort at his hands on such conditions. That you were already betrothed to the young burgomaster, and were only waiting for your birth-day to be united. He said that Mynheer could neither love nor understand you; and said, very insolently, that in giving you to the burgomaster, I was throwing a pearl before a hog. This angered me.' `Nay, sir, you should have let the compliment paid to me have caused you to overlook that to Mynheer Van Vow,' she said, laughing. `Methinks, daughter, you of late show a disposition to ridicule the worthy and virtuous young burgomaster.' `No, sir, the ridicule is in himself. I do but speak as his appearance irresistibly suggests.' `It would please me that you shoul comport yourself before him and to hi with more affection' `Does Mynheer Slems make complaint of me to you?' `Not in the least. He invariably speaks of you in the most satisfactory manner. He has said nothing.' `Then, sir, permit him to be the judge.' `But I wish you to appear more in public with him, especially at conventicle. Is it not becoming to treat your future husband with public respect?' `When he is my husband, sir, I will so treat him,' she answered something firmly. `What more said this secretary?' `The secretary, methinks, is more agreeable to thy thoughts than the worthy burgomaster. I will answer thee, as I would put thee on thy guard. When he found that I would not consent to give you to him, he showed much fire of resentment, and holdly bade me look sharply after thee, for you should be his bride ere you should be the burgomaster's wife.' `Said he so much, sir!' she exclaimed with animation and with pleasurable surprise; and it would have been singular if a young girl did not manifest some emotion at such a flattering compliment to the power of her charms over a stranger, and he handsome, high-born und confessedly in love with her; and from whom when she had met with him she had been eye-worshipped as if she had been his divinity. Jacob Leisler looked to see her countenance change with alarm, but it betrayed no fear, greatly to his amazement. `You do not seem to apprehend that he will carry his threat into execution.' `Yes sir, I fear he will not.' `You fear he will, you mean.' `Yes, sir, I fear he will—(not.') This last tone was uttered sotto voce. `It becomes you to be on your guard, and not to venture out even upon the stoope after dark. I know not where this young man now is! He has made his escape. A rumor reached me that he had been seen putting off in a boat, and a fisherman even came to me demanding justice, grievously complaining that his skiff had been stolen from the shore, where he left it. It is, therefore, likely he has made his escape to the islands.— He is a bold, fearless man as we have all had evidence, since his sojourn in the Province, and in his audacious attempt to hold the fort. There is no question but that he will be sufficiently enticed by your beauty, Bertha, to attempt to do you mischief. Therefore keep close, and by day go not out unless the burgomaster attend you.' `I hear you, sir, but I pray you, if he is to attend me, choose two good steady men to carry his sword for him; for he will be sure to cut off my head with it in some of his fearful movements with it as he goes along the streets.' `You laugh at the young man, but he will make you a good husband. He will grow wiser as he grows in years, and will be an honor to you if you honor him by duty and obedience.' `But sir, are you not going to dwell in the Governor's house in the fort?' asked Bertha, who wished, by suggesting this to him, to be freer in her own movements and less annoyed by the continual presence of the burgomaster, who, if her residence was to be made the head quarters, would be constantly present as an attendant upon her father. `True; that will be necessary, as all the public papers and officers are there; and as I shall have much company at all hours I will do so. Besides, it is needful I remain in the fort for the better security thereof and firmer clenching my power.' `So I should suppose, sir.' `And with you there I need not fear anything from this young Logan, whatever be the character of his intrusions.' `Indeed sir, you need not fear him, I do not,' she answered, both archly and seriously seeing that her plan was likely to involve her own liberty of action. `I shall not leave you in the town and alone in the house, Bertha. I shall need a house-keeper in the fort and to eat and drink. I shall to-morrow move you and the two servants with such things as are needful.' Bertha saw that she could not say any thing to this decision, and she quietly acquiessed. She had no definite motive in wishing to remain in the town, other than an undefinable idea that she might, thereby possibly see the young secretary, whom she felt sure of not seeing if she was shut up in the Governor's house within the fort; for within this defence was located both the government mansion and the principle protestant church in town, which, in the various changes of dynasty had successively been a Dutch reformed, an English Episcopalean, and Roman Catholic chapel, and now about to be fully restored to its puritan worship again. Even when a Roman chapel it was on alternate Sabbaths used for the accommodation of the protestants, as a `conventicle;' which will account for Bertha's having been there and seen the young secretary, who, though a papist, was drawn thither on conventicle Sundays by the beauty of the burgher's daughter. This mutual occupation of the same edifice by catholics and protestants was not unusual in the early days of the colonies during the reign of James; though in all other respects, singularly enough, there was little love or courtesy. Bertha, also, by being in the town hoped to be out of the way of the young burgomaster, who, ever since she had began to think of the handsome secretary, had become particularly distasteful to her. She had let things flow smoothly on between herself and him and her father without objection; but as the time drew nigh fixed for the marriage to take place, she began to have certain misgivings that her fate was sealed, and that she would have to submit to her father's will. Nevertheless she resolved to do her best in the interim to make the burgomaster utterly repent of his bargain. She had for this purpose planned with two young friends an ingenious and most mischevous system of tactics expressly bearing upon the unfortunate young wooer. This she had intended to put into operation upon her victim the very day the revolution broke out. But this attempt did not alter her determination, which was rather confirmed by the pleasing revelation made to her by her father, that the gallant young secretary was passionately enamoured with her. This intelligence which found an echo of joy in her heart, served to give point and direction to her purposes touching Slems Van Vrow. She now felt that if she could defeat him she might yet find a more congenial wooer in the youthful nephew of the Governor, who had already half her heart. But all these thoughts were vague and unformed in the brain of the pretty Bertha. One thing only was formed and settled in her mind, and this was, that she would never marry the fat little burgomaster, even to please her dear-loved father. Whether she should ever marry any body else was altogether quite an indistinct, dreamy notion that she had hardly dared to dwell upon, delightful as it was. The removal to the castle, or rather fort, was to take place early the ensuing morning; and her father, after taking tea with his daughter and leaving her to put up and send such things as would be needful for them during their sojourn there, took his departure to return to the citadel and place it and the town in a state of defence against any combination of the Papists. Guards were posted at different points in the town, and sentries paced the streets with wary vigilance. A countersign was established, and a proclamation sent forth and published by the tongue and bell of the town-crier, that all citizens found out of their houses after the bell rang nine o'clock, should be placed under arrest. It was full half-past nine o'clock before Jacob Leisler got through with the important business before him. Among the affairs transacted was not only placing the city under military law, but the appointment of a committee of safety to act with him as a council of advisement for the immediate government of the province; the committee being chosen from the most influential burgesses of the town of his party. This committee also signed an agreement, drawn up by Jacob Leisler, to adhere to the Prince of Orange, and, with their lives, to support the Protestant religion. The five captains of the train—bands, each of them substantial and tried citizens, formed a part of this committee and affixed their names to the instrument. Jacob Leisler having settled thus happily all these weighty matters, and thereby shifted much of the responsibility of the government upon the shoulders of the council he had appointed, began to-feel more confidence in himself and his position. He now made known to the committee his purpose to despatch, without delay, an address to the King, with a copy of the agreement they had signed, so that any malicious communications from their enemies, Bayard and Livingstone, might be forestalled. The time necessary to draw up the address and get the co-operation of his council, made it so late, that at ten o'clock he despatched the burgomaster with a message to his daughter that he should not be able to return that night, but that Mynheer Van Vow would act as her protector. This message being despatched by the little round burgomaster, the new Governor gave himself up to preparing his address to the King. It was a novel position for a quiet merchant to be all at once drawn from the sphere of middle life and the privacy of a simple citizen, to controul the affairs of a province, establish a government, provide for the preservation of the peace and the security of his authority, forming a council, proclaiming martial law, and holding supreme power at his own will, all in the same day, and then to sit down at night to address a powerful monarch to acknowledge his power and rule. But Jacob Leisler, with the emergency, found himself equal to all that was demanded of him. His talents, though not of a high order, were respectable, and he possessed a certain dignity of character and air which commanded the respect of men who felt that they were his equals, if not superior to him. The address which he drew up bore evidences of experience, wisdom, and diplomatic skill, that was not looked for from a merchant; and being read to his council, received their unanimous approbation. It was past midnight before the address and other documents, to be forwarded to the crown by the Boston ship, were sealed and ready for the messenger, who, when he made his appearance booted and spurred, and armed to the teeth, proved to be the brave Sergeant Graff. As he stood before the council, the Governor delivered to him the package, which he placed in a pouch of deer-skin, slung beneath his arm, and firmly secured it. `You will ride night and day, sergeant, until you reach Boston, sparing neither your horse nor yourself. Should you find that there is a messenger from Bayard on board, which be diligent to ascertain, you will embark also; for you have in this pocket-book funds sufficient to take you to England, maintain you there two months, if need be, and bring you back. Your business is to get the ear of the King, and deliver this package into his hands before any other can approach him from the province. Now seek your horse and ride, and God speed you on your way.' The sergeant gave a brief, military salute to the Governor and his council and left the apartment. He passed out of the fort and walked on across the Green, answering challenges every few rods. He traversed the whole length of the town until he reached a grove full half a mile above the Green, where he found a horse tied a little off from the road, and thus far out that the sound of his hoofs might not excite suspicions in Bayard's party. He loosed him, mounted him, and galloped rapidly away on the road to New England.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. THE FISHING HUT. We now return to the adventures of Robert Logan, whom we left escaping from the fortress down the harbour in a small fisherman's pirogue, which he had taken from the mouth of the fosse. He pulled steadily on until he came within about one hundred rods of Governor's Island, and directly in front of a rude fishing cabin, overshadowed by forrest trees, opposite which, anchored in a small boat, sat a youth about sixteen years of age, engaged in fishing. As Logan rowed forwards the youth raised his head and gazed at him with very manifest surprise. He was a short, freckled-faced, sunburned urchin, with burnt whity hair, which had probably never had a comb passed through it, a pug nose, and small, twinkling light blueish eyes. He had on a pair of patched canvas breeches that came to his bare knees, and a patched shirt that he had probably worn as he did his trowsers, without washing for a year or two. He was bare headed and bare legged. From a close, squinting scrutiny of Logan's appearance, he began to inspect the pirogue which he was in; when as if satisfied, he all at once broke out with— `Dod and lobsters, you stranger chap, but that's feyther's scow any how. What be ye doin with it, and whar's feyther?' Logan stopped rowing and looked at the speaker with a smile of curiosity. `So this is your father's boat?' `Yah; and what the devil have you done with feyther?' he demanded, very resolutely. `Your father's over in the city. Do you live in that cabin?' `Yah; but how come you, chappy, with the old sucker's boat?' he repeated, not seeming to care for the apparent distinction of the stranger; for Logan wore an undress uniform surtout, with a sword and belt, in which was stuck a brace of elegant pistols. Besides, his chapeau, which lay upon the seat by him, was laced and adorned with a cockade. `Who do you call the old sucker?' asked Logan, laughing at the fearless impudence of the ragged varlet. `It's dad. But that aint tellin what I want to know. If you've stole that are scow you'd better never see'd daylight.' `How much would your father sell the scow for?' asked Logan, wishing to conciliate him, for he had made up his mind to seek, for the present, an asylum in the fishing hut. `How much? Did you buy it of the old devil then? If you have he's drinked it all up by himself, and'll come home drunk as a crab' `No, I hav'nt bought it, but I will.— What shall I pay?' `Three silver dollars; not a steeny less,' answered the boy. `There is a gold guinea,' answered Logan, rowing along side and placing it in his hand. `No cheatin, chappy,' said the lad, cautiously eyeing him and then biting the money between his teeth, to ascertain if it would bend or no. `I'm not sure but this is a flum. Hant you no silver? You cant fix me on silver, no how, chappy.' Logan tortunately had four dollars in silver in his purse, for which the boy gladly gave back the guinea; but each of the pieces he deliberately dug into with the point of his fish knife before transferring it with confidence to a black looking seal skin pocket or pouch in his waist band. `The boat is mine now,' said Logan, not a little amused at his precautions, also at his bold, saucy, brusque manner. `Yah, yours to burst to blazes with if you want it. But where's dad?' `Over in town, I suppose.' `What flummucks be they kickin up thar? I heard firin and a muss.' `Why, you see, the good old King James is turned out of his throne by another, and so over to the town the friends of the old King have had to give up the fort to the new King.' `That's the muss is it,' he said, carelessly, and with the most perfect indifference, as he baited his hook and cast his line over the gunwale of his boat into the water: `I wonder if the new King's folks 'll give more for fish than the old uns?' `Be sure they wont, for there'll be a falling off. The new King's friends dont keep lent and fast days, and so they wont buy fish.' `Dont 'ey keep lent, tho'?' exclaimed the youngster, with surprise. `No, they wont keep lent or fast Fridays,' answered Logan, who saw that he had the boy on the right side of politics for himself. `Then I'll none o' the new King!' he cried, very positively. `What is this new King's name, chappy?' `Orange.' `Orange! That's queer.' `It is because he eats oranges instead of fish.' `Then let him and his orange go to the devil,' responded the boy heartily. `What kind of a king's man are you?' he asked, eyeing him closely. `The old king.' `Then you and I are friends.' `I am happy to be your friend,' answered Logan. `Now as we understand each other, I will tell you how I came to be here and in your father's boat. I was Secretary of the former Governor who has fled from the Orange people and is now on board yonder ship that is just visible standing seaward. I held on to the fort as long as I could, but found the Oranges too strong for me, and so I made my escape from them. I was so fortunate as to find this boat on the shore behind the fort, when, without asking by your leave. I sprang into it and paddled out of the way; and here I am as you see; and happy am I to fall in the way of a friend to King James.' `Which is King James the fish or orange king?' `Fish.' `Hurrah for King James!' `The friend of the fishermen!' loudly repeated Logan, who now saw that he had won his acquaintance. `You say you took dad's boat to get away, hey?' said the lad, fumbling very seriously at his money pouch and pouring the silver out into his palm. `Yes. It would not have been safe for me to have been taken by them.' `Then, I'm blessed if I'll take money for the boat;' and he extended it towards him with a sort of noble air. `You do not repulse it,' exclaimed Logan, gazing on him with sarprise at conduct so unlooked for from such a dare-devil looking, freckled-faced urchin. `Yes I do! you shant pay no how; you are welcome to the use o' the boat; and if you'll row ashore and come to the cabin, you shall have something to eat.' `You are very hospitable, but you forget that I am escaping from my enemies and that if they should be told where I am, they would come after me.' `How'll they know it? None on 'em come here.' `But your father!' `He's dead fish agin orange, and 'll be glad to keep you; so, chappy come ashore and stay as long as you will.' This invitation was given by the lad with rough but hearty hospitality. It suited Logan's purposes to avail himself of the offer, and, thanking him he pulled in shore, side by side with his boat; for he had drawn in his lines and taken to his oars also. As they rowed along Logan made up his mind to make that place his asylum for the present, as none could be more advantageous from its contiguity to the town; and as the fishermen would prove his friends, it would be as safe as some place farther removed where he could not place such confidence in the people. But he felt that in the boy he could place the utmost faith; he saw that though ignorant, he was naturally shrewd, fearless and independant, and had something noble in his character, as was evinced by his refusal to take money for the boat, which, however, Logan insisted he should retain. `From this retreat,' reflected Logan, `I can at any time visit the town in disguise and through the fishermen daily hear from it. I have not yet given up all hopes of doing something for my party yet. Ere twenty years pass I will be there among them.' They now reached the shore, and leaving the two skiffs in a small cove between two rocks, advanced towards the hut, which was situated about fifty steps from the water, and facing the town which lay about two miles or little less to the northward. `Who have you in the hut? Who lives with you?, asked the young secretary. `No body but feyther and I. Meyther has been dead deal a time ago.' `Glad my Meyther is dead! Then ye're like the old man, for he is pesky glad; for he says she was a hard 'un.' `No, I did not mean I was glad she was dead, but glad there was no more in your family than yourself and father; for I shall be less likely to be betrayed. Are you sure your father 'll like to find me here?' `He'd like to find himself here first, I'm thinkin',' said the boy dryly, as he kicked open the door of the hut. `He'll swear some when he finds the boat gone: I shore I'll have to pull up to town after him and bring him home.' `I hope he will not be so vexed as to inform on me when he finds I am here.' `Not a bit! I'll give him the silver, and talk to him about Fish and Orange, and he'll be ready to fight for the old King and you to, give him blue gin enough.' The hut was a rude cabin, containing but a single apartment, hung about with fishing apparatus, and holding in one corner, a bed. A table, and three or four chairs; a chest, and two barrels half filled with dried fish, were all the furnishing, save a couple of patched and coarse fishermen's suits, that hung about the bed. As soon as Logan's eye fell on these, he made up his mind what he would do, `Are those fisherman's clothes your father's?' he asked. `Yes,' answered the boy, pouring out a dram of gin from a stone bottle into an earthen cup, and drinking it off. He then deliberately refilled it and handed it to Logan, who declined it, very much to the surprise of his young host. `I have a plan in my head, my friend. What is your name?' `Steiny Sneck; what is yourn?' `Robert Logan.' `Now let's hear your plan,' he said, throwing himself back into a chair. `You must know, I left the town so suddenly, that I had no time to look after my affairs. Now, I wish to go back again to-night; but as I should doubtless be hanged, if taken, I wish to disguise myself.' `What is disguise?' `I wish to put on your father's fishing clothes, so that they'll take me for a fisherman. In this way I can deceive the Oranges.' `It's capital; you shall have 'em; but on one condition.' `What is it?' `That I go with you.' `It will be dangerous.' `I don't mind nothing about dangers. If you'll let me go with you, you shall have father's dress, and we'll start off together.' Logan reflected a moment. All at once his countenance brightened. He saw that to have him with him would be additional security, as he being known to be a fisherman, any companion with him would pass off without suspicion. He, therefore, resolved to let him accompany him; and he believed that he could make him useful, for he seemed to possess qualities which would make him a valuable adjunct in any secret expedition. `You shall go with me,' he answered decidedly; `but can you keep my secret?' `Try me.' `But you might let it out when you have drank a good deal.' `If I do, blow me with one of your pistolets. I was never so tipsy that I didn't know what I was about. Now, there's feyther, I seen him get so drunk he didn't know a tom-cod from an eel. But I an't so weak-headed. But when shall we start, chappy?' `Just before night, so that it will be dark when we reach the town.' `But I must go over for the old un! He'll bust if he stays there all day and his boat gone. I must go hunt old Sassafax!' `You seem to have quite a fanciful set of names for your father!' `Yah! he's a good un and deserves 'em all,' answered the youth coolly. He then proceeded to light a short pipe, while Logan began to examine the dress in which he resolved to return to the town under cover of the night. He found, from its size, that Steiny's father was a very large-framed man, and that he could wear them over his own apparel. This he was not a little gratified to ascertain, which he did by trying on the complete suit, loose jacket, trousers, long boots, and tanned leather sea-cap. When he had put on the cap last of all, and turned to Steiny for his criticism, the youngster uttered a tremendous oath in significance of his entire approval. `The old man to a scale, but the gills and flippers!' he said, after a moment's further inspection. `You mean my hands and face!' `Yes! you'd be cocht by 'em before you'd got three lengths of a boat into the town. You've got too soft skin and red cheeks, and your hands are as white as a cod's belly. `I can black my hands with mud.' `Yes, and make 'em smell of fish by handling some too. But what'll you do with your face?' `I'll besmear that.' `I'll tell you. There's some yellor ochre in the hill-side back o' the hut; I'll get some. This, and with a little brick-dust, I can make you jist as black as dad.` `Do by all means, and the sooner the better. On the whole I think you had best begin at once, for two reasons; it will give me some time to practise and get used to my clothes, and then it may not be altogether safe to trust the old man. He may get so wrathy at my taking his boat, that, if he is choleric at all, he won't easily forgive me. So I had best rig up before he comes off; for he may get some other fishermen to bring him down!' `That's true enough. On the whole I don't believe 'twould be zactly safe to trust the old Dolphin! He might blab in his liquor up town, as how he had a genteel boarder in his family, which might breed trouble, you know.' `And I have thought, that, possibly out of revenge for my taking his boat and keeping him in town all day, he might sell his secret to the Oranges for money, and thus I should be taken or have to fly.' `I didn't think of that. So we'll keep it from the old man; and I'll tell you, chappy, how we'll manage about the clothes. When he comes, if he comes before night, he'll of course find his boat here. I'll tell him it was brought home by a strange fisherman, who didn't ask nothin' for his trouble.' `You are very shrewd. You would lead him, then, to suppose it had got adrift!' `Yes. I would then bring him to you and we'll drink with the old chap; and if he thinks the dress looks like his, I'll swear him out of the idea. Give him gin and he wouldn't know a cobbler from a King!' `Then I shall be safe. But if he should insist that I had his clothes?' `Then knock him down! that is the way I do with him when he's obstropylus.' `Very well; I see you and I are upon a perfect understanding. Now if you serve me faithfully in my affairs up town, I will not only give you money but serve you to your advantage.' `I'll do any thing to go agen the Oranges. Fish forever, and down with the Oranges, is my motto!' `And a grand motto it is. But now for the yellow ochre and brick dust!' `That is the figure. I'll make you look so like any body else you'll never know yourself.' `That is what I should like for a day or two, till I get matters arranged in town.' The lad then left the hut and climbed a caving bank in the rear after the ochre, while Logan, congratulating himself upon the propitious state of his affairs thus far, and upon the acquaintance of such a fast friend as Steiny, stood in front of the hut looking thoughtfully towards the town. There it lay before him, about a mile and three quarters distant, the walls of the fortress upon the point in warlike relief, and beyond it rose the roofs and towers of the town, with the tall slender spire of Trinity Church crowning and giving character to the whole. As far as his eye could reach on the west of the town extended the Hudson till the bold walls of the palisades shut in the view. The East River stretched northward on the east side of the town, with a few vessels lying near the shore and wharves; opposite the town rose abruptly from the water the cliff-like promontory at the western extremity of Long Island, dark with forest trees. Beneath it, crowded close to its base, were two or three huts for drying fish. All around him the view was extensive, and characterised by islands and water, and headlands, dispersed over the landscape in the most picturesque variety. To the south and east stretched the channel to the sea, which lay broad and blue beneath the sunlight, the only object visible upon it the far distant ship which bore the fortunes of the late catholic governor to the shores of Europe. `I also ought to be on my way to England,' said Logan as his eyes, turning from all the rest of the wide view around him, rested thoughtfully upon the snow-white spec that was rapidly blending with the horizon. `I should be in that vessel with my relative; but I cannot quit the Province and leave my heart behind! I must see this fair girl, and know from her own lips whether I can have any hope at her hands. It is in vain for me to try and reason myself out of this passion, or to laugh myself out of it. The maiden has entranced me. My soul is ensnared like a bird in a net, and it is useless for me to try and break the meshes. I feel an instinctive hope that I am not indifferent to her. But all must not be trusted to glances of the eye. I must see and speak with her. I will know the worst or the best. And there is yet a higher motive which prompts me to linger here; and this is to endeavor to retrieve my folly in losing the fort as I did this morning. If that tall, traitorous sergeant, Graff, falls into my hands, he shall, in five minutes after he is in my power, be shorter by the head! Never was surprise more complete than mine in finding the gate closed upon me. I owe my safety to the madness of the multitude; for if Jacob Leisler had not turned to correct the error into which they seemed to have fallen, I should have found it difficult to have got away as I did. I will not leave the Province until I make an effort to retrieve my honor in this matter. So, between love and war, I have enough to do in yonder fair town,' he added, fixing his gaze upon it, and recalling the image of the lovely Bertha, who seemed to his love's eye a divinity which hallowed it. Steiny now made his appearance holding in his hand several little pencils of ochre, which he had found in the clay of the hill. Logan, by his direction, sat down upon a rock in front of the hut, and proceeded to let him rub his face with the dingy chrome. `There, you are now quite respectable,' said Steiny; `but you look too much like an orange for me, so I will try a little brick dust!' This was applied to the yellow ground and diligently rubbed into the pores of the skin by Steiny with his fingers. The ears and his hands were not excepted. `Now you will do when you have rubbed your skin over with a piece of old canvass,' said the boy, surveying him. Logan performed this finishing part of the process, and then looking at his face in the bright hilt of his sword, saw reflected as dark and brown a visage as even Steiny's father could boast of. His disguise was complete.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. THE DISGUISED SECRETARY `There is no danger of detection in this guise,' said Logan to the boy; `if I should come in front of myself in a mirror, I should never suspect who the gentleman was.' `Praps you'd ask him if he had any fish to sell!' observed Steiney, who seemed highly pleased at the transformation his skill had effected. `But will this wash off?' `Yoh, as quick as water touches it,' responded the boy; `so you will have to keep watch on it.' Logan, now transformed, as to externals, into as rough a looking fisherman as ever took fish over to the town, to sell in the market-place, wandered about the rocks, impatiently waiting for the approach of night. He dined on boiled mackerel, with Steiney, acting as amateur cook, greatly to the astonishment of Steiney, who, from the first, seemed to look upon him as incapable of doing any thing; for when he looked at his white, small hand, it did not appear that it had ever been soiled. But, when he beheld how handily he cooked the dinner, his respect for him was very greatly raised. After dinner, they both went out from the shore, in their skiff and smoked their pipes and caught fish. `Ods fish, master Logan,' said the boy, on seeing how skillfully he plied the hook, `you fish as if you had been brought up to it.' `I have fished a good deal, Steiney, in the brooks of England.' `What kind o' fish scalers do you catch in brooks?' asked Steiney, with a sneer. `Trout, and other brook fish.' `What kind o' bait do you use?' asked Steiney, drawing up a small cod, and slatting it off his hook into the bottom of the boat. `Flies!' `Flies?' `Yes. The trout feed on flies that dart about over the water. They catch them by jumping at them. So, by taking a fly, or a bait made in imitation of the flies they like, and playing it above the water, they see it, and spring out after it.' `That must be pretty sport,' answered the boy. `But what is here? Here comes a boat from the town, and it is got close to us, afore we see it.' `It is a pirogue and two men in it,' cried Logan. `Yah, and one on em is old Haddock.' `What, your father!' `Yah. Now look out for thunder!— But he don't know you have brought his boat, so he can't quarrel with you yet, unless he twigs his jacket.' Logan now drew in his line, and watched the advancing skiff with great interest. It brought not only the owner of the boat he had taken away, but what was of more interest to him, news from the town, as to the state of affairs. As soon as the boat got within hailing distance, a large stout fisherman stood up, and hailed: `Ho, hillo there, Steiney! Have you seen any thing of my scow? Some villain has stole it, and I have had to get neighbor Beck to bring me down!' `Aye, yah, dad! The scow is safe.— Just take a squint ashore, under the black rock, and you'll see it, safe and sound.' The fisherman placed his hollowed fist to one eye, and closing the other, looked in shore, and at length discovered it.— He announced his satisfaction by an enormous oath, and an expression of wonder how it got there.' `It got tired of waiting for you, up town, dad, and so pulled home itself,' answered Steiney, as the boat containing his father, and a fisherman who lived on Staten Island below, came along side of the skiff. `No, did it though?' asked the old man, as if he did not like to believe it, yet did not know how to doubt it. `You are lying, Steiny.' `Then, how did your boat get home?' `Sure enough,' answered the man, puzzled and rubbing his lofty, seamed forehead. He then cast his eyes upon Logan, who was quietly watching his countenance, which was as hard featured, rum-preserved a visage, as ever passed under his observation. The old fellow was about fifty years of age, tall and large boned, with a face as brown as if his complexion had been composed of ochre and brick dust. He wore a short fishing jacket, and dutk shorts. Upon his head was stuck a faded, red woolen cap, and his feet and legs were bare. His small, grey watery eye fell on Logan inquiringly, as if he might have something to do with the mysterious movements of his boat. `Who is this, Stein?' `The man that brought your boat home. I suppose you forgot to fasten it, and it got adrift! He didn't ask anything either, and ought to make you pay.' `He's a right good neighbour,' answered old Sneck; `but it seems to me, friend, I've seen you afore. There's somethin' about ye kind o' familiar, but I can't call ye by name.' Logan and Steiney exchanged glances. They both saw that what was familiar about him was the jacket and shorts and old hat; and instead of recognising them to be his he had the notion that it was the man in them he recognised. `I dare say; I have often been up in town,' answered Logan, enjoying the old man's perplexity, who still closely observed him and his dress; but not as if he suspected the costume was his own, but as if trying to recal the man. He at length shook his head. `Blessed like somebody, but I'm hooked in the gills, if I can tell who. Familiar as my hand, and yet I couldn't swear I'd ever seen you! Where did you say you lived?' `About in spots here and there.' `Where did you pick up my boat?' `Up the harbour a piece.' `Was it alone?' `Yes, and the oars in it.' `And so you knew it and brought it home? I wish you'd towed it back to the town, for I've had a devil of a time of it! I got ready to start and found it gone, and searched the whole shore up and down; but it was not to be seen fin nor tail. So I was sure it was stole.— Then I went off to the new Governor and complained to —' `Who is the new Governor?' demanded Logan, in a tone so quick and startling that the old man looked upon him with a broad stare, as also did his comrade. `Why one would think you were hailin' a mast head, friend. Who is the new Governor? Pray when did you leave the town that you dont know that?' `This forenoon. But what is this news?' `Why, then, I'll tell ye,' answered Sneck; and he stepped into the boat, seeing that the Staten Island man was impatient to go on his way, which he pursued as soon as the old man left his skiff. `You see there's the old Gov. Dongan giv up first the other day and got aboard the vessel that is gone. Well, things growd worse, and last night Nich follered without sayin a word to any body.— Well, you know that dare-devil secretary, Logan, of his, Dongan's nephew?' Logan and Steiney both professed the most entire ignorance of any such person, and Sneck went on: `Well, he is a nobleman's son, from over sea, and ony come out to the Province on a lark, as I s'pose; for I don't see what good he had done by coming, except set the girls heads crazy ater him. Well, he wouldn't go with Nich and staid behind in the fort and swore he'd keep it till King William came for it! That's what they say in town. But afterwards, you see he thought he'd have to give it up, and so he writ to the rich merchant Jake Leisler, tellin him that if the town would raise ten thousand dollars he'd surrender without fightin; which must ha' gone heavy agen his grain, for they say he loves fightin as fish do watr. Jacob sets the bells to ringin and calls the town together. That was the ringin' we hear, Steiney, just afore I put off. Well the town wouldn't agree to it, and Jacob made 'em a speech and they took his advise and sent to this Jack-a-lantern Logan to surrender. He laughed at the community and told 'em to go back and send Jacob Leisler, for to him he had writ the letter and he wanted to see what he had to say.' `I know old Jacob Leisler, dad,' said Steiney. `Onct I sold him two cod and he gave me a shillin piece, and when I was goin to give the change he told me to kaep it. He's a man for me!' `Well,' continued Sneck, `he went to the fort-gate to see what he wanted and axed Jacob to come inside and have a talk; but Jacob didn't like to trust himself in the hands of such a wild chappy, and so said he would hear what he had to say there. But master Logan didn't care to speak out afore his soldiers what he wanted to tell him, and so he opens the gate and walks out to him. Well, they walked together a bit, though nobody knows what he said, and by and by Jacob was seen to get angry and leave him. Then our chappy goes to get in the fort agen and the soldiers wouldn't let him come in. They hurrard for king William, fired the guns and set the whole town in a muss. The people thought the guns was bein fired at them and they started down to take the fort. But Jacob told 'em it wos for the Orange King and the fort was theirs! He then turned about to catch the chappy Logan and he was off, not a soul could tell how! All this is great news, friends; for the fort was took at once, the sojers disarmed and Master Jacob Leisler was made captain in it and Governor!' `Jacob Leisler governor?' exclaimed Logan. `Yes, and a good majestic Governor he makes as the best of 'em. When I went before him tellin me about my skiff, he received me as if I'd been a gentleman and listened to all I said, though twenty were about him; and told me if I didn't find it he would pay me for its loss!' `That was liberal,' remarked Logan. `But do you say he has assumed the power and authority of Governor of the Province?' `I dont know what you call assume; but I know he is chosen Governor, and stays in the castle, and has chose a council and raised five train-band companies, and made captains and put guards all about the city, and acts in every thing the same as Governor Andross used to do in his day. If you want to see war go to town, for there's plenty of soldiers in the streets and in the fort; and not a papist dare show his head without a yellow ribbon on his hat!' `Can all this be true?' `I guess it is, chappy. You never see sich times. There is brave drinkin in the tap-rooms and seven shillins to every man that'll list in the train-bads. Arter I'd lost my boat I thought I'd have to turn soger. But look-a-here, chappy, will you tell me where I've seed you afore now?' `I guess only in town about the fish market.' `Where did you say you lived?' `Along shore.' `Well, I dont swear to your face for certain, but a Guinea black nigger if I wont swear to your jacket, and your shorts too. I've seen em afore!' `Feyther, come, let's take a drink all round,' said Steiny, who thought the recognition was becoming too close; and, taking from the caddy a small black bottle, he poured into a mug a stout dram, and handed it to the old man, who took it down at a gulp. `More, Steiny, more!' he cried, holding out the cup. `Wait till it goes round, dad. Come neighbor, drink.' Logan touched it to his lips and passed it to the old man, saying— `You need it, uncle, more than I do.' Sneck did not wait to be twice invited in a matter of that kind. He placed the mug to his lips and slowly emptied it, his eyes resting still upon a peculiar patch in the thigh of the shorts. Logan noticed his observance and changed his position. In doing so he brought to view a still more remarkable patch, when the old man's eyes brightened up and he sprung up, with a slap upon his knee, crying— `I'm d—d if them shorts aint mine! Steiny, he's a thief! He stole my boat and shorts! That's my jacket and hat too! I'd know em in Jerusalem!' and the old fisherman sprung forward to grapple with the supposed thief. `Stop, old shark!' cried Steiny, catching him by the waistband and holding him back. `You are drunk—you dont know nothin!' `Steiny let me go! Aint that my cap?' `No!' `Nor my jacket?' `No!' `Nor my shorts?' depressing his voice at each inquiry, perfectly confounded by Steiny's assurance. `No, dad. Its the gin you've taken. You see double, and think every thing that another has on is yours' `Give me some more liquor, Steiny,' said the old man, sinking back upon the thwart of the boat. `If I'm drunk I axes neighbor's pardon.' He then drank off a third mug of liquor, and Logan then suggested to Steiny that they had best pull in shore. The old man made no reply, but steadily eyed the patch. He was, however, growing so tipsy that Logan felt no further solicitude about his recurring to the subject. Upon reaching the shore, the old fisherman was roused at the sight of his boat lying there. He staggered towards it, stumbled into it, and fairly embraced it in his arms, addressing it with all the puling childishness of inebriety. Leaving the boat, at Steiny's urging, he then grasped Logan's hand and thanked him over and over again with tipsy solemnity, for bringing the boat back; but at every few words he would utter some expression that betrayed his perplexity touching the resemblance of the jacket to his own. `You must make him drunk before he gets into the hut,' said Logan, whispering to his young coadjutor, `or he will trouble me.' `I'll do it, chappy,' answered the youth; and turning to his father he proposed that he should drink the good neighbor's health, who had brought back his boat. To this proposition the old fisherman was nothing loth; and as Steiny continued to ply him, by the time they got to the door of the cabin the old man's legs failed under him. He, however, staggered in and threw himself upon his bed, and was soon in a state of thorough insensibility. `You came pretty near being found out, chappy,' said Steiny, as his father gave signs of oblivion to all worldly matters, but he was too misty in the outset to be sure, and now he's fixed till to-morrow morning. `You have shown yourself sharp witted and a good friend to me,' said Logan. `I shall not forget you.' `When are we to start to go up to town?' he asked, with youthful impatience. `I want to see some of this warlike stirring going on. I never saw a man killed in my life.' `There has been no one killed, nor perhaps will there be at present,' answered Logan; `but we will start in about half an hour. It is now within an hour of sun-down.' `Are you the chappy, then, the old Gin-bottle talked so sweetly about?' `Yes,' answered Logan, smiling at the manner and tone in which the inquiry was put. `Well, didn't he give it to you under his jacket?' `I bore it quietly.' `Not a wince; but you had an escape of it, tho'. If it had not been for dad's boat they'd ha' got ye, may be!' `It would have gone hard with me.— Indeed, perhaps I owe my life to finding it.' `Well, I'm glad they didn't catch you. You see that old Tom Cod is an Orange man!' `Yes, I perceive he is by his speech. It will not do to trust him.' `Not a bit.' `And you spoke in favor of Jacob Leisler. Are you a Protestant?' `I don't know. I'm fish agen Orange. `Still you like Leisler.' `He spoke me kindly once, and wouldn't take the change for fish.' `But he is a Protestant.' `I don't know what kind of fish that is.' `He isn't a Roman Catholic, I mean.' `What is that?' `One who obeys the Pope.' `Pope! I have seen a Pope-fish! But they bite like a shark.' `Don't you know any difference between Papist and Protestant?' `Never heard of such fish.' `King James was a Papist. The Orange King is a Protestant.' `I go dead agen Orange, salt or fresh,' answered Steiny, who was independently ignorant of all religious politics, and whose politics were defined and limited to `fish' and `orange.' These, in his mind, were the two great designating term to distinguish the adherents to the two crowns. Logan regarded him with unfeigned surprise. He could not believe that there was to be found one so near a maritime town who knew nothing about religion: to whom the great rallying words `Protestant' and `Papist' were wholly unknown. The sun was slowly falling towards the west when they entered their boat and pulled out from the island towards the town. It was a bright afternoon, and the waters reflecting the brilliant golden hues of the western sky, shone like a gilded mirror. Here and there was visible a fisherman's skiff, gliding across the harbor homeward from town, pulling either to the Jersey shore or one of the islands. Over the town hung a low blue wreath of smoke, above which, piercing it, rose the needle-like spire of Trinity, always a prominent object in the scene; but now rising alone above the azure cloud like a beacon from the bosom of the blue deep, it presented an interesting appearance, and even drew the attention of Steiny, who paused in his rowing to point it out to Logau's admiration. At length the broad red disc of the sun glided away into the western world, leaving behind him a glorious pathway of colored light. A gun was fired from the fort, announcing the sunset, and the flag was lowered from the staff. The twilight was soft and glowing and lingering. Before it deepened into the shadows of the night, the moon arose and flung her silvery scarf across the waters of the harbor; and above her car sparkled the planet Venus, like a diamond swinging in the skies: By the light of the moon Logan directed Steiny to pull into the mouth of the fosse, at the very point from which he had in the morning taken his departure. Having sprung to the land and assist ed Steiny in drawing the skiff under a sort of hanging bridge, which was extended from the outer wall of the fort to the decks of vessels where stores and ammunition were being discharged, he took the young man by the arm and walked with him up a narrow causeway of stone that was built to protect the shore from the encroachments of the waves. A few trees growing along the inner verge of this causeway, the first beginning of what constitutes at the present day the magnificent Battery, cast their shadows across and concealed in a degree their progress. All this time they were leaving the citadel on their left hand. At length they came into a street that led obliquely from the harbour in the direction of the Green. Here and there a light glimmered from the dwellings or shops, and one or two persons were moving past at a quick step. One of them being challenged in a low quick tone, as he reached the head of the street, recalled to Logan what the old fisherman had told him and warned him of the danger he was running in thus entering the town. `We shall be stopped, unless we are very wary,' said Logan to his companion, as they stood under the shadow of the last tree of the causeway, which also flung its branches half way across the street that they had reached. `Go you forward, Steiny, and get as near the sentinel as possible, and then conceal yourself till you can catch the countersign, that is the word that men give when they are challenged by the soldiers. I will await you here.' The next moment the lad was worming his way along in the direction of the sentry, with the noiseless celerity of a serpent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. THE PATROLES. The fisher's boy, Steiney, at length reached, unobserved, to the stoope of an old Dutch house, where he concealed himself, within ten feet of the Sentinal who paced to and fro on the corner of the street, his match-lock at his shoulder. After he had been thus ensconsed about ten minutes, he heard a foot-step approaching. The man came nearer and nearer, and, when within twenty feet of Steiney, was abruptly challenged by the Sentinel in broken Dutch, `Who guesh dere?' `The Prince,' answered the man. `Goot!' responded the Sentry, carrying his musket to his shoulder; pass on de vay vhere you is goin.' The citizen passed on and Steiney taking advantage of the soldier's face being turned the other way, stole from his hiding place, and safely reached Logan. `Well, what is the word?' demanded the disguised young Secretary quickly, advancing, as he spoke, from out of the covert of the tree. `When any body is asked who they be,' answered Steney, `they says `The Prince!' `Did you hear this reply?' `Yes,' answered the boy, `a man said Prince, and the soger let him go by.' `That is enough, you have done your errand well, I would not have missed your company on this expedition, Steiney, for a good deal. Come, let us march.' `Which way?' `I will tell you by and by,' answered Logan, crossing the street and taking the side-walk up to where it joined Wall street. As he approached the sentry, at the corner, he assumed a swaggering gait, and advanced with an air of confidence. The gun of the soldier was brought to the present, and the challenge `Who goesh along dere?' fell loudly upon their ears. `The Prince,' answered Steiney, quickly, getting out the word before Logan could speak it. `Den you may goesh, fishermens,' responded the heavy Dutch soldier, carrying arms again, and stepping back, so that they might pass. `You seem to keep vigilint watch here, in the town, good man,' said Logan stopwing, and addressing him. `What is the state of things just now? Is all quiet?' `Notin but what is as quiet as a mouse,' answered the man. `The streets are filled with sentries, I find.' `Yash, Governor Leisler know how to keep de papist still. He goot Governorsh.' `So no papist is allowed to stir out, hey?' `Not a nose or fingers,' responded the man, stoutly. `Except they show the yellow ribbon?' `Yash, if dey show dat, den dey be let alone.' `Have many of them worn the badge?' `Yash, goot many on em.' `Do you know where Bayard, or Courtlandt are?' `In dere housh. Day no been out on em to day. We hab de town all to ourself. Be ye de fisherman dat lost de boat?' `Has it been found?' asked Logan, gratified to find his disguise so perfect. `I does'nt know dat. Peoplesh did say dat de young Mynheer Logan, was seen by a womans from her window, paddlin off in such a boat; but she did'nt tell it till the whole day was gone, and he got away.' `I wish I could have caught him,' said Steiney. `And the Governorsh wish so too,' answered the Sentinel; `and he'll pe caught soon; for the Governorsh's excellency means to give one hundred silver marks to any man dat will find him. So fishermen, as folks think he is down among de islands, dere is a goot occasions dat you may be rich men's.' `So there is,' answered Logan; `I shall take good care to look him up.— Good night, brave sentry.' `Goot night, fishing-peoples,' responded the Dutchman, as Logan and Steiney moved on. `I'm glad, chappy, we hearn that,' said the latter, as they got out of hearing. `Yes; I see that I shall have to be on the look out, even at the island, or I shall be taken. It is in your power, Steiney,' he said turning to the boy, and laying his hand firmly but kindly on his shoulder; `it is in your power, while I am in town, to betray me. One word from you would place the hundred marks offered by Leisler, in your pouch. But do you know that I believe you would sooner cut off your right hand than betray me.' `You say true, chappy. If I thought you had doubted me, I would pay you for it by getting you into trouble. But because you trust me, I will let them kil me before they find out, from me, who you are.' `I understood you well, you see. Are you ready now, to serve me in all I shall ask of you?' `Yah, to go and take this Orange Governor by the head and heels and carry him down to the island and make you Governor in his place!' `Then we are inseperable. Here, we turn into Nassau street and thence into Maiden Lane; for I am going to stop first at the house of this Mynheer Leisler!' `I know where he lives. He bought fish of me once,' answered Steiney, pulling at his waist bands as he tramped along by the side of Logan. A few steps from the corner they were a second time challenged and passed on. The streets, though the hour was early, were deserted, save by the sentries. The doors of the houses were closed and barred and most of the windows on the lower stories shut and bolted. Here and there a light shone from an upper window, and occasionally a head was seen stealthily peering from a pane of glass. At the junction of the street with Maiden Lane a patrol of a dozen armed men came suddenly upon them round the corner. Logan stood perfectly still to let them pass. But when he saw their leader he felt inclined to retire with precipitation, for he recognised in him the tall sergeant Graff who had betrayed him. But to escape would have been impossible. He summoned his self-possession and whispered to Steiny, `If he speaks, you reply; I am deaf! `Ho, men, stand if ye be good men and true!' cried the sergeant as he came near; `what is the word by which honest people pass free in these times?' `The Prince,' answered Steiny boldly. `Very good. But are you not fishermen? What are you doing here in the town at this hour? The Governor hath commanded that every one who dwelt not in town and had his occupation here should depart to his home at sun-down. Ho, you fellow, why are you here?' `Dick, is deaf as a haddock; he got deaf livin' on them kind o' fish. You see we had our skiff stole and can't get home.' `Ho, so you are the men, hey, that lost your skiff?' `Yes, and if the Governor wants us to go off to island he must send us, for we ha'nt fins to swim.' `Well answered, boy; very well answered. How came you by the pass word?' `Didn't he give it to us that we might stay and look up the thief what stole our scow!' `True enough. If he didn't give it you couldn't have it. But it seems to me, old fellow, you want deaf to-day,' he cried, shouting in Logan's ear, `when you went to the governor and told your story. You made so much noise we all wished we were deaf.' `Deaf people ol'ays thinks every body else deaf,' answered Steiny. `That's true. Well, go and catch the thief if you can; but if it is the man I think it is I hope you wont find him very soon.' `Who do you think it is?' asked Steiny. `The young master Logan! If he didn't get off in your skiff I don't know where he is. All I wish is that he may get away and trouble us no more. If he is taken he will swing for it, and I like him too well to wish to see the poor young gentleman die!' `How can you say that, Graff?' said one of his party, `when you gave up the fort by shutting him out!' `Well, I didn't shut him out because I had any thing against him, but because I saw that if things went on there'd be blood spilled; and so I thought it best to stop mischief. I told Mynheer Leisler the same, as boldly as I speak it now; for I told him Mynheer Logan had always treated me well, and I wished no harm to him; for I had not forgotten how kind he always was to me and any of the garrison that got sick. I suppose he hates me for what I did; but if I could ever see him I'd tell him I did it for his good and the country's; and that I'd quicker serve him now than any other man, if I could do it without betraying the present cause!' `If I said such worts, Graff,' spoke the one who had before replied to him, `it would go hard with me with the Governor. But you are a favorite.' `Governor Leisler knows me to be honest, and that I shall serve the Province no worse for wishing well to master Logan. But march, soldiers! When you find your boat, men, let me know.' The patrole passed on. Logan stood a moment looking after it, and then said to Steiny, `I have a good friend yet, I see, in the man I most feared!' `He didn't know who he talked to, I guess, said Steiny laughing. `But, if I was you I would n't trust him; for he'd give you up, because he's one o' those kind o' men that would think he'd have to, since he served the Orange Governor. For all he has said, chappy, he'd think more o' the Province than his likin for you!' `I dare say you are right. But here we are near the abode of Jacob Leisler. It is closed up, save a light streaming from an opening in the shutter above.— Now, Steiny, I want you to go and knock at the door, and ask for the Governor. I wish to know whether he is in the castle or not. If they say he is at the castle, then ask for Bertha Leisler, his daughter; for she may be with him, and I wish to ascertain.' `Well, chappy, and what shall I say?' `I will tell you. I love that young maiden, Steiny, but I am not sure that she loves me or thinks of me. Now I want you, if you ascertain that she is there to say that you want to see her alone.' `I was never alone with a girl in my life without bein scared,' answered Steiny. `She wont hurt you. Begin and tell her about the loss of your skiff, and how you wish her to ask her father to pay you for it, as he had promised your father; and I wish you to tell her you hear the Secretary Robert Logan, had escaped in it; and then watch her face, and in your own way, by adroit words, draw from her what her opinion is and whether you think a visit to her would be acceptable from me.' `I understand, chappy. You want me to bait the hook while you catch the fish.' `Yes; I want you to ascertain by your own wit whether it would be safe for me to see her and to let her know that I was in her power.' `I'll do it!' `Be discreet!' `Yah, I know what to do. But where are you going?' `I have some person to see farther up town. In one hour you will find me seated upon the platform of the well there.' As he spoke he pointed across the street to a circular well, which was used as the public fountain by the whole street.— `But I will wait first to see if you are admitted.' Steiny approached the house, and ascending by three steps to the stoope, knocked upon the door. He waited full a minute and repeated the knock. There was a slight noise over his head at the window shutter; it was softly and carefully pushed open, and a face appeared looking down: `Who is it?' demanded the rich-toned voice of Bertha Leisler. Logan's heart bounded. He was almost of a mind to bound across the street and answer, `It is I, dearest Bertha!'— But he feared it would have alarmed her, as most likely, and also have defated all his hopes, for he was not like a lover who has confidence in the affection of her he loves; but he was uncertain whether she cared for him; nay, whether, if she had him in her power, she would not without hesitation give him up to her father. `It is Steiny Sneck,' responded the boy. `And who is Steiny Sneck?' asked Bertha, firmly. `I'm a fisher from the island.' `So I see you are a fisher by your dress,' answered Bertha; for the moonlight shone broad upon the stoope and fell upon him. `But what do you here? This is no time to be abroad startling people, when the town is full of tumults. What is thy wish? tell speedily and be away, or the guard will trouble thee!' This was spoken partly as if with a desire to terminate the interview, and partly from an apparent wish to keep the youth from falling into the hands of the patrole. `I am the son of the man who had the scow stole, pretty mistress, and I want to see the Governer!' `The Governor? there is no Governor!' Governor Leisler!' `True, true; I had forgotten it; he is the Governor. But my father is at the citadel engaged in mighty matters!' `I want him to give me pay for my boat.' `He will to-morrow.' `I must buy another and go home tonight, or I shall be put in prison; for that is the law, they say.' `True, true! Poor youth! Is no one with thee?' `No, pretty lady.' `Well, tell me how much thy boat is valued at.' `Three marks and a half.' `Then I will pay thee in the Governor's name. Wait till my maid opens the door to thee.' The fair head disappeared from the window and the shutter was drawn to.— Steiny rubbed his hard bony hands with delight. Logan would have taken this opportunity to have run forward and joined Steiny and gone in with him, feeling secure in his disguise, since he had defied Graff's scrutiny. But Steiny, by saying that he was alone, prevented him from obeying this impulse; for if, when she opened the door, she beheld two instead of one, she would have been alarmed and closed it upon them. He, therefore, saw that his only way was to leave the first interview with Steiny alone, who had shown talent enough to manage it. Logan's surprise at finding her at home instead of at the fort with her father, was only equalled by his joy. The bolt of the door was carefully drawn and the door partly opened, showing a middle-aged Dutch woman in a white cap, and blue handkerchief tied about her neck. Holding the door nearly too, she put out her hand, in which were the three marks and a half, and said— `Here, lat; here is ty monies, mistress send tee. You must not come in these wars times.' `Tell your pretty mistress,' answered Steiny, who saw that his prospect of seeing Bertha was likely to be defeated by this wariness, `tell her if she is the daughter of Governor Leisler, I have something to say to her very particular.' `What is it you would say, fisher? called out Bertha, from the hall behind the servant. `What none by thy own ear must hear,' answered Steiney. `Stand aside, Brecket,' said Bertha, `and let me hear his errand.' `I cannot speak it here, the soldiers coming by, may see me, and carry me off, for all you couldsay. There comes a patrol of them now, up the street. I must either go off out o' the way and sight or be let in.' `Let him in, mistress; he is but a boy; and Mynheer Von Vow said, let no man in.' `I heed not what the burgomaster said or said not,' answered Bertha. `If you have words for my ear, come in quickly, ere thou art seen.' Steiney glided in, the door was closed upon him, and the very next moment appeared Mynheer Van Vow, at the head of his patrol, which, he had taken from the fort for the special protection of the dwelling of the lovely Bertha. Logan had only time to withdraw into the shade of the low eaves of a shed opposite, and escape being seen, though he recognised the valiant burgomaster, who, as Jacob Leisler had told him, was the betrothed husband of Bertha Leisler. He felt at once, the most decided dislike to little Van Vow, and, if little Van Vow had been aware of his presence, and his attachment to Bertha, he would doubtless, have taken quite as strong a dislike to him. `Soldiers, halts!' cried the burgomaster. His guard came to a full stand, and somewhat in a heap. `Dress dere! Strait lines, all of yous! Shoulters arms, and carry your heats ups!' These orders were obeyed with about the same precision with which they were given. `Vera goots,' exclaimed the burgomaster, seeing then place themselves in near-a semicircle. `Now lets me gif you your order. You vil keeps garts here till twelve o'clocks, ant let no poty in, as dont say `Slems,' and nopoty out as dont say `Slems.' Now I goes in to smoke mine bipes, mit te Governorsh daughters, and tell her not to pe afrait; for I haf brot te bravest gart of soldiers, to keep gart at her doors, as is in all New Yorks.' `A plague on that crack-brained simpleton,' exclaimed Logan, as he saw him go to the door and rap upon it, with the hilt of his huge sword. `She cannot care a fig for him. I will yet circumvent him to his hearts' content. Let me wait and see if he is let in. There is the window open, above the door, again.' Who is it hammerin at the door?' called out the shrill voice of Brecket. `It ish me, te burgomaster,' answered Mynheer Van Vow, with great confidence. `Vell, ant what ish te matter?' `Tell my beloved Bertha, goot Vrow, tat I am here, wit a garts of brave mens almost as myself, to keep her from alarms and thongers; ant tat I vill come in and smoke a bipe a little while. `I will tell her,' answered Brecket, returning from the window; while Logan waited with curiosity, the issue. In a few moments he returned. `Mynheer burgomaster?' `Vel, Vrow Brecket.' `My mistress says she is very much obliged to you for your gart, and says when you want to go into barrachs, to smoke, there is the fort.' `The sweet Bertha is very witty,' answered the burgomaster. `She bade me say too that she thinks you can keep betters guards, outsides dan ins.' With these words. the house-keeper shut down the window, and Mynheer sat down upon the stoope, deliberately lighted his pipe, and, leaning upon his sword, began to amuse himself with smoking and dreams of love; for this discomfiture, in no degree troubled him. Every rebuff of the kind he took with simple good feeling, and thought neither less of himself, nor of Bertha, therefor. Perhaps his philosophy was based upon the comforting assurance, that she was destined to be his vrow, at all events in due time, however wilful and wayward she now chose to be. Logan rematned till he saw the burgomaster as comfortable as if he had not a thought beyond his pipe, and his brave troop on which he gazed affectionately as he smoked. He then moved noiselessly away, not a little gratified at the answer Bertha had sent Mynheer Van Vow. `It is a settled matter,' he said with joy, as he walked on; `it is clear as the sun, that she cares nothing for him, but only endures him. I am elated with hope.— By the good mass! fat and simple burgomaster, if such be her reception of thee, I will see her this night, before thou dost. And what will become of thee, Steiney, thou audacious rogue. It is a good omen that the fair Bertha would not see the burgomaster, because she was listening to thee; and had my name, already fallen upon her ear? I will know within one hour, leaving thee, boy, to get out of the house by thy own wits, as thou gottest in.' `Stand, and give the countersign!' cried a voice, suddenly, accompanied by the rattle of a watch-lock. `Bertha!' `Not so! You are my prisoner.' `The Prince!' answered Logan, correcting himself, and smiling at his own mistake. He was suffered to pass on, and, after answering the challenges of two more sentries, he stopped before a gate in a bye street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. THE CONSPIRATORS. The gate at which Logan stopped was in a garden fence on the skirts of the town. Two large trees grew above it and intercepted the light of the moon, so that the spot lay in the deepest shadow. It was owing to this deep shadow that he was able to stand unseen close by the gate until a relief guard marched by in the middle of the street. When it had passed he pulled a string that he found on the side of the gate-post, and waited for admission. Over the top of the gate was visible the roof of a house, half buried in the foliage of the enclosure.— He waited full two minutes, when, becoming impatient, as he was about to apply his hand to the string a second time, a footfall was heard within the garden, approaching the gate. A low voice called out to know who was there. `A friend, father Stephen!' `The voice of an enemy may use the language of a friend. What is it you wish, and who would you see? These are times when it is safer for men to keep their doors fast than the hand of welcome open.' `I am Robert Logan,' answered the secretary in a low voice, applying his lips to the lock of the heavy gate. `Is it, indeed!' repeated the priest in tones of joyful surprise. `I should have known the voice. Who is with thee?' `No one.' `I will let thee in presently;' and the sound of a chain and bar let fall, and then the noise of a bolt shoved back, were followed by the cautious opening of the door. `Gome in quickly, my son. There are those about who may see thee. But what, I know thee not. Am I deeeived!' `No, father; do not fear; this is but a disguise.' `Then enter.' Logan entered, drawn kindly in by the priest, who immediately closed the gate and replaced bar and bolt. `You seem to take great precaution, father.' `I have need to; for whipers have reached me that public feeling is very strong against me because I am the Roman priest. But where have you been? How is it that I am so happy as to see you in safety. I can hardly realize that it is you. This strange disguise, too,' cried the priest, holding him where the moon fell upon his face and dress. Were it not that the voice were yours, I should never know you. The face is not yours.' `I have stained it! I escaped to the islands! I found a fisherman who befriended me, and through him I got this disguise and conveyance back to the town, where I have hastened to see what my friends have done and are doing in these up and down times.' `I am glad to see you! There are others in my house, from whom you will find welcome, and whom you will be glad to see. They will be as much surprised at your coming as I am. We had strange and painful rumors about you. Some said you had thrown yourself into the water; others that you were killed; others said that you had escaped on board the ship; while towards night a story went that you had been seen making your way in a fisher's skiff towards the islands.' `The latter is the truth. But whom shall I meet?' `Livingstone, the Mayor, Courtlandt, and others, firm and true Catholics, who are fired with indignation at the usurpation of this Leisler, and are here assembled secretly to discuss the affairs of the province at this crisis.' `I am come, then, in good time. Are there any others there that may betray me?' he asked, as he approached the door of the priest's abode. `Not one.' `Then I will throw off my fisherman's coat, and appear before them in more seemly apparel.' `Leave them in my study, which we shall first pass through, my son.' They entered the porch of the house, and then ths study, where Logan dropped his disguise, appearing in his blue undress uniform, with his sword at his side, an attire as elegant as it was becoming to his fine figure. The priest stood by and witnessed the instant transformation with surprise. `You are aow yourself again, son, save the complexion of yoar face.' `That I dare not remove. My friends must let me pass as I am.' The priest now led the way into a large square inner apartment, lighted by half a dozen wax candles, placed upon a sort of altar at one extremity. Several pictures of saints and one of the Crucifixion hung around. In fact, the place was a private chapel, where not only the Padre Stephen, but the more devout of his parishioners were used to perform their more strict devotions.' About twenty persons were assembled in this chamber, all of whom broke off conversation and directed their eyes to the door with glances of inquiry and suspicious vigilance. They were all armed and seemed men of substantial character in the town. Three or four of the more prominent were standing together near the candles, conversing closely as the priest entered leading in Logan. Every eye was fixed upon his face expecting an acquaintance, but his visage seemed that of a stranger. Every one became cautiously silent and looked at the padre to learn from him who his visitor was. `Gentlemen, under this Indian mask of ochre is the nephew of Governor Dongan, who has safely arrived among us!' `Logan,' cried the gentlemen nearest to him coming forward and grasping each a hand while they stared in his face, slowly recognising him. `Is it possible we see you again? How have you escaped?' the asked together. `In a skiff to the islands, which I left again at sun-down to come and see what you are doing. I am glad Mr. Livingstone and Mayor Courtlandt,' he added, pressing the hands of these gentlemen, `at finding you are here assembled, not tamely to yield the government. You will have my earnest co-operation in whatever you may decide to do!' Others now crowded round this popular and, with all his gay errors, much loved young man, and warmly congratulated him upon his escape. He then briefly gratified their curiosity by explaining its mode, and how he had managed to reach the priest's house, `which, he said, `he thought would be the most likely place to hear of what was doing in behalf of the cause.' `We were speaking of you and wishing you with us not five minutes before you rang the bell at the gate,' said Mr. Livingstone, a small, gentlemanly looking man of forty-five, with a high bald forehead, a profusely powdered wig, and dressed in a rich suit of black velvet with lace ruffles over his hands. His face wore an agreeably vivacious expression, and his large full hazle eyes sparkled with the native cheerfulness of an easy temper. He was one of the most influential citizens of the Catholic party; though as he was a very liberal Catholic and favored the Protestants not a little, the latter claimed him quite as much as the former. It is probable, therefore, that if they had called upon him to take the government instead of Jacob Leisler he might have accepted it; and instead of being now one in a Roman Catholic conspiracy, been ruling the protestant party with the fortress in his hands. But the accession of Jacob Leisler at once drove him to the papal opposition of which he was now one of the leaders; but more from political than religious motives. By his side, and who had grasped Logan's hand at the same time he did, stood Courtlandt, the Mayor of the town. He was nominally a Roman Catholic, but had been edncated a protestant. His adherence to the Jame's party in the provence had given him the chief ruler-ship in the town; and thus his interests had been identified with the papist cause. He was a thin, sharp-visaged man, of dark complexioned and an air at once austere and dominant. His influence with the Roman Catholics was not so great as that which was possessed by Livingstone; yet they had full confidence in him. The other persons of the party were firm and unbending Romonists and men that the priest could wield and will.— This latter person was a man in the prime of life. He had been educated at Rome in the Jesuit college; and possessed all the boldness, zeal and blind attachment to papal supremacy that marks that extraordinary sect of religionists. He had been in the Province during the four years, from the accession of James II. to the present time. His influence over the people of his own faith was singnlarly powerful. He governed them not only in matters of faith, but in politics. He controuled all the votes of his parishoners, and thus held the balance of power. It was by his influence that Courtlandt had been elected to the office of Mayor. Had he chosen to have thrown aside the gown and taken the sword he would have made an efficient leader.— Had he raised the standard of resistance to Leisler's power and taken the field in person he would have overturned the new government within twenty-four hours after its organization. From the reception which Logan met with by these gentlemen, it will have been seen that he was far from being an inconsiderable person with them. As the Secretary of Gov. Dongan, he had the controul of a good deal of executive patronage, and having with his uncle much personal influence he was courted by all who sought place or favor from the head of the government. Logan was of the best blood of England, and was heir presumptive to an Earldom. These circumstances gave him consideration. He was also a person of pleasing and popular address, of a high order of talents and a skilful diplomatist. In fact, Dongan was only nominally the Governor. The reins were actually in Logan's hands. Being naturally gay and fond of pleasure he fell into some youthful excesses which brought the censures of the graver portion of the citizens upon him; yet with all this he was popular even with the protestants, towards whom he was always found more lenient than his uncle. When at length the latter, from fear of assassination, retired on board the Swedish ship a few days prior to the opening of our story, and surrendered his authority into the hends of Nicholson, his Lieutenant-Governor, he would have prevailed on Logan to follow him on ship-board. The latter, however, felt no desire to go, not having any fear for his life, and being, besides, too deeply enamoured with the fair Bertha to leave her and leave his heart with her without having declared his passion. He, therefore, remained with Nicholson, who, finding the excitement growing stronger after the resignation of the Governor, and getting news of the accession of William of Orange, he lost all courage, and followed, under the cover of night, his predecessor. In vain he urged Logan to accompany him. `No,' said he firmly; `I will not desert the government in this cowardly manner. I will stay behind, and, by maintaining the citadel, obtain an honorable capitulation. King James's authority shall not expire in the province in such disgrace. I will remain and give the body deeent burial, if die it must. But I shall keep life in it so long as I can. Make my respects to my uncle, and tell him that i shall not give up tha authority of King James until I can surrender it with honor.' The manner in which he held the fort, and the means by which he lost it, are already known to the reader. After some minutes' conversation touching Logan's escape, Father Stephen said, `We were speaking, my son, about this usurpation of Leisler, and the manner in which we can overthrow his power. You have come in good time to give us the aid of your sword, if need be.' `Is Leisler, then, so strongly established as I hear?' asked Logan with deep interest, speaking among the gentlemen with the quick air of one who felt himself a leader equally with the chief of those present. `Yes,' answered Courtlandt, of whom the inquiry had been more particularly made, `he took possession of the fort about nine o'clock this morning; by ten he had a garrison of his own men in it, under arms, and his officers chosen. By eleven he had issued a command for five train-band companies to be organised; and by noon he was at the head of a force of full four hundred men, and the supreme authority in his hand.' `He has moved with activity the most extraordinary,' continued Mr. Livingstone. `He has placed the town under martial law, and established, in fact, a military despotism. He this afternoon sent a deputatiou to Mayor Courtlandt to know if he would acknowledge his authority and that of the Orange King.' `And what reply was returned?' asked Logan, who listened with the deepest attention. `I replied,' answered Mr. Courtlandt, with his brow darkening, `that I should acknowledge no usurper, nor an usurper of a usurper. I defied him.' `What then?' said Logan eagerly. `He issues a proclamation, commanding all Roman Catholics, “Papists,” as he terms us, to remain in our dwellings, unless we choose to appear abroad without arms, and wearing in our hats the badge of the heretical king—a yellow ribbon.' `And some have done this?' `A few base fellows. But I am glad Leisler has given us this opportunity of knowing who are not our friends. All who would have been false to us have gone out from us under this yellow flag. We now know who are our friends, and can trust them one and all.' `And, Mr. Livingstone,' said Logan, `what is it you purpose?—in what way are you to trust our friends?' `Are you to be told that this is a conspiracy, Robert Logan,' said Father Stephen, `to overthrow Leisler and hold the government till this news be confirmed.' `What news?' `Of William of Orange's succession. There has been no official notice of it. For what we know King James II. still sits on the Catholic throne of England.' `True, it is but a rumor by the way of Boston; but I am convinced it will be confirmed. Andross was overthrown and imprisoned wholly on account of this intelligence. The Boston citizens must have known it to be sure; and, though we got it by rumor thence, it will turn out to be trne. Still, my friends, I am ready to act with you. I came back to the city to-night mainly to consult with you. Our honor is concerned most intimately in the recovery of the citadel and the reestablishment of the Catholic domination as it was until we are called upon by a British King to transfer it to another.— We will then acquiesce. We cannot be branded as traitors or rebels by doing this.' `The power,' said the priest, `is still lawfully ours; legally it is in the hands of the Catholics. Leisler's government is an usurpation. He is a rebel, and will be declared so by the King he professes to serve, if we can overthrow his power and hold it. You, Robert Logan, represent Nicholson, and so long as you have not resigned the authority Nicholson left with you, the authority is in your own hand. The new King must receive from you. Leisler has no power to surrender it; for he has not received but usurped it. By overthrowing him, we can, if we can do no more, get him declared as a rebel and a traitor.' `The new Governor seems to have acted with decision,' remarked Logan. `He has established himself firmly. It will be difficult to overthrow him. The fort will stand a vigorous defence.' `Yes, if we attempt to carry it by assault,' answered Courtlandt. `But father Stephen has suggested a mode that will be successful if we are true to ourselves.' `What is this?' asked Logan, with strong manifestations of interest. `Next Sabbath,' said father Stephen, `the protestant citizens are to go to the conventicle within the fort to have service and offer thanks for their victory and the accession of the Protestant Prince. Then, gentlemen, is your time to act. Till that day keep perfectly quiet and seem to submit to the new rule. On Sunday send to Leisler to ask permission to attend the services. If he consents, which he may do on condition that you come unarmed and wearing the orange badge —' `I will not even put on the yellow ribbon and wear it an hour to get posssession of the fort,' answered Logan with flashing eyes. `No, no, father Stephen, I will not wear the Orange badge, not I. `It may be policy.' `No. Some other mode must be suggested.' `Well, hear me through, son. I was about to propose that by adopting the orange badge you might obtain access to the interior of the fort and once there with a select number of bold partizans get it into your hands. But as this course is objected to by you, I propose now what was to have been the alternative, viz: that after they are assembled in the fort at their prayers you invest it, enclose them in it and thus compel them to such terms as you see best to dictate.' `This is better,' answered Logan.— `When do you say?' `Next Sabbath.' `Four days hence. How many armed men can be relied on to engage in this?' `Three hundred,' answered Mr. Livingstone. `Are you to organize them?' `Yes, we will see that all is ready,' answered father Stephen, `if you pledge yourself to lead, and resume the government in the name of your uncle!' `You require from me no pledge. I am ready to do it as soon as may be. I must redeem my disgrace in letting the fort slip out of my hands as it did!' `Then all is settled for action,' answered father Stephen. `In my capacity as priest I shall to-morrow send to Leisler to request permission to go forth at my pleasure to visit the sick. He will not deny this I am sure, if I know the man! Under this pretence I will hold speech with every Catholic in the town, and on Saturday night give you the names of all who will engage in the conspiracy!' `Once get the government back we shall find no difficulty in presenting Leisler in the light of a rebel to the new king,' said Courtlandt; `for he is bound to recognize the commissioners of the crown, and as Leisler has seized his Province without authority he will come under censure if not lose his head! He will find that too much zeal has eaten him up. You, Robert Logan, are the only authorised person, as having been left the government by Nicholson, to hold it till news came from England, and then to surrender it to a new Governor.' `I am ready, gentlemen, to do my part in this matter.' `Gentlemen,' said father Stephen, `before we break up I would suggest that a message be at once sent to the king by Mayor Courtlandt, protesting against Leisler's usurpation. There is a ship to sail from Boston next week; and it will be a wise policy to get the king's ear first!' `This by all means,' exclaimed several. `Once get him prejudiced and Leisler is a lost man!' cried Livingstone `Father Stephen, you draw up the address as most capable.' `But it occurs to me that if we could get the co-operation of Colonel Bayard and his protestant friends,' said the priest, `that our end would be more effectually gained. We are all aware that this gentleman with the protestants of the English church are opposed most strongly to this protestant Dutch dynasty of Leisler's!' `Yes; I saw Bayard and had an hour's talk with him this afternoon,' answered Livingstone. `He is very violent against Leisler and calls him as stoutly a rebel as we do!' `This division in the protestant ranks will favor us,' said father Stephen. `If word could be had with Colonel Bayard and his countenance given to an address of remonstrance it would have weight with King William as coming from one of his own faith.' `This is a good thought of yours, father Stephen,' said Logan. `I will see Colonel Bayard myself to-night. Although we may not get him to join us in all points, there is little doubt but that he will be easily prevailed upon to send a protest to the king against the usurpation of the Dutch party! Then Leisler's fate is sealed!' This plan met with general favor; and it was decided that Logan should wait upon him at once. Livingstone proposed to accompany him, observing that he had come through the streets and would return so disguised as a soldier, having got the countersign, as Logan had done by listening. He then resumed his diguise, which was as perfect as that which Logan once more put on, and the two went together from the house and were let out of the garden by the priest. The rest of the conspirators left the garden one by one by another gate that opened upon the fields, and, having the pass-word and being variously disguised, each found his way homeward without suspicion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. THE FISHER'S BOY AND BERTHA. The two conspirators, Logan and Livingstone, reached the house of Colonel Bayard, after a devious course, but without being detained by any of the guard they encountered. The house of this gentleman, stood near the river, and out of the denser portion of the town. It was a tasteful villa, embosomed in trees, and was one of the most imposing residences in the Province. They approached the house through a gravelled avenue, and ascended a handsome flight of steps to the door. A light was visible, through the drawing-room windows, on the left. Their presence, even before they knocked, was announced, by the deep baying of a dog, chained within the hall. The voice of his master was heard within, silencing him. `The Colonel does not mean to be taken unawares,' said Livingstone, as the deep-mouthed notes of the dog, echoed through the hall. `Who desires admission?' called out the Colonel, within. `Livingstone,' replied this gentleman. `You are welcome, and I will admit you in a moment,' was the reply. `Are you alone?' he added, as he removed a bar from the inner side of the door. `Only a friend.' The door was opened, and when Colonel Bayard saw, by the light of the moon, a soldier and a fisherman standing before him, ready to enter, he stepped back and presented a pistol, which he held in his hand. `Who are you?' he demanded firmly. `Livingston, and Robert Logan,' answered the former, as he removed his soldiers' cap. `Ah, I recognise you. But this person? Did I hear aright?' `Is Robert Logan.' `Escaped? He is well disguised. I see no likeness, but on your faith, I admit him with you. You see I am something cautious,' he said, as grasping the hand of each, he closed the door, and rebarred it; but I have no idea of letting my house become a barrack for Jacob Leisler's soldiers. There have been two patroles, already, tramping through my-grounds. This is an indignity, I am in no humor to put up with. Since I sent him word, this afternoon, of which, you doubtless have heard, that I refused to acknowledge his authority, he has seen fit to keep spies upon my house. But one of his minions will enter my doors at his peril. But, I am detaining you here in the hall: walk into the drawing room.— I am glad to see you, Mr. Logan. Rumor had it, you had fled in the Swedish ship. Does Leisler know you are in the town?' `No!' `He would be glad to,' cried Colonel Bayard, smiling, as they entered an elegant parlor, which had partly the air of a library. `But your disguise would defy any one. Speak, and let me be sure of you,' he added, with a lively air. `I assure you, my dear Colonel, that it is me, and no other person,' answered Logan, taking off his fisherman's hat and coat, and exposing his uniform. My face you must take on credit, for it looks darker than my own.' `Where have you been?' `On the islands, where I got this disguise.' `I am glad, on many accounts, that you have escaped. What do you intend to do?' `Try and recover the fort and hold the government, till authority comes from the King.' `Ah, indeed!' `This is my intention. I have no fear of opposition from you.' `No, so long as Leisler's usurpation is put an end to; though, I confess, I would rather see the protestant party in power, than yours again. But you will not hold it long, so I will second you. But how?' `We have not exactly decided upon our plan.' answered Logan, who saw that it would not be safe, to trust any more of his plot to the protestant antagonist of Leisler. `We shall see how things turn, and be governed by circumstances. Our object, in calling on you, is to propose that you, as one of the most prominent men, of the English protestant party, draw up an address to King William, protesting against Leisler's usurpation, and declaring him a rebel. This will have the effect, if it comes earlier, to the King, than any ffattering letters Leisler may transmit, of preventing his communications from producing any effect. King William, will form his opinion from your letters, and any thing afterwards, from Leisler, will produce no other effect, than to confirm him in his opinion, that he is a rebel.' While Logan was speaking, Colonel Bayard smiled, with meaning; and when the former had ended, the latter took from a table a written paper, and held it before him. It was addressed `To their most Sacred Majesties, William &amp; Mary, `You perceive, gentleman,' he said as they read the address, at the begining, `that I have anticipated your suggestion. I was interrupted, by your calling, in the composition of a solemn remonstrance to their Majesties, against Leisler's government. I will read to you, what I have written.' They listened to the address with deep attention; and when he had concluded they both pronounced it satisfactory. `When that is read by the King,' said Livingstone, `Leisler's fate is sealed. He will be put under an arrest by an order from the crown and sent home to be tried!' `How shall you forward this?' asked Logan. `By a trusty horseman who is at this moment making himself ready to start as soon as I seal and direct it. He goes to Boston and thence takes the ship to England. He has orders not to stay travel until he reaches the foot of the throne and sees the letter in the King's own hand delivered!' `Leisler has then placed a rope around his own neck,' said Livingstone, with stern bitterness. `We are well pleased at finding you in this mind! Let no delay intervene. If Jacob Leisler suspects or gets wind of this messenger, he will at once, having the power, despatch a vessel direct to forestall you, and so represent the necessity of his taking upon him the controul of affairs that we and not he will be proclaimed the rebels!' `He shall not know it. No man has had breath of it save you two!' `And that we may not delay you in finishing it, nor your messenger from his saddle, we will take our leave, having effected that which brought us hither,' said Livingstone. `I will not urge you to stay; but Mr. Logan, pray by what steps do you hope to destroy Leisler's power?' `The most effectual way, sir, is by this division among the protestants carried out into open war!' `How do you mean?' `I mean that you form at once a strong party, unite with ours and thus endeavour to overthrow his!' `He could not withstand the two combined,' said Livingstone. `But suppose we combine and overturn his government, who then, Mr. Logan, you or I will be elevated to the authority?' asked Colonel Bayard, with a significant smile. `I should not, sir, much as I esteem you personally, consent that a protestant should succeed,' answered Logan, firmly, `It would be exchanging a penny for a penny!' `And I, sir,' answered Colonel Bayard, `could not, much as I esteem you personally, consent to use my influence to replace a paplst in power. If I combine with you and organize an Episcopal party, it will be that I may overthrow Leiler; but I cannot consent to help put a Roman Catholic in his place. We have had enough of Romanism under Dongan,' answered Colonel Bayard in a severe tone. `I perceive, sir,' responded Logan, colouring, yet keeping his temper, `that we have too many points of difference to amalgamate as a party; but we agree both in branding Leisler with rebellion!' `That we agree in!' answered the protestant leader, with decision. `We are then of one mind in a chief point. There let it rest.' `There is one thing I would ask of you, Colonel Bayard?' said Livingstone in an impressive manner. `I will hear you, my dear sir.' `If the Roman Catholics rise in a body to overthrow Leisler without your co-operation, will you remain passive? If you assist not us, will you refuse to assist them?' `This you may depend upon. But I also will put a question to you Mr. Logan? If I raise a party to overturn Leisler before you make any such movement, will you remain passive?' `We will remain passive so far as that we will not aid Leisler against you; but I boldly assure you, Colonel,' continued Logan with a resolute air, `that if you overthrow Leisler and assume his authority, I shall feel it my duty to endeavour by overturning your governmant to re-establish that which he has usurped!' `We then understand one another,' answered Colonel Bayard in a fearless, frank manner. The two Catholic gentlemen now took their leave with courtesy, and were let out of the door by their host, who gave to each of them his hand as if they were between the utmost harmony on all points. `We have gained one thing by this visit,' said Logan, as they passed down the avenue; `and this is the knowledge that Bayard contemplates a revolution; and that we can't act too speedily. We have to fear him, quite as much as Leisler!' `The politics of our poor Province,' said Livingstone, `are in a strange way. Three parties, and nearly equal in strength, are about to divide and tear the land! But it is fortunate for us that the protestants are at dissension. United, we should be defeated by them; but dissevered as they are we can singly oppose them. It is well we did not unfold all our plan to Bayard. He might have betrayed it, because we are papists, especially if he found that he could not get his party in force to prevent our attack on Sunday. You were very prudent to check yourself as you did!' `I perceived that he had no sympathy with us, and that the only union that could be between us would be based upon our mutual opposition to Leisler's government. Here we are now at the entrance of the main street. Shall you return to father Stephen's?' `Yes, and report the result of our interview with Bayard! Which way do you take?' `I proceed down in the direction of Maiden Lane.' `Take care of yourself, my friend, or Leisler will have you in his hands. You are aware of the reward he has offered for you?' `Yes. I shall not remain in the town. I have a safe retreat at a fisherman's hut on Governor's Island. I shall, however, be present at Father Stephen's on Saturday night.' The two conspirators then parted, Livingstone following a path along the skirts of the town, which brought him, after five minutes' walk, to the field-gate of the priest's garden; while Logan took the side-walk along a narrow lane, which was subsequently named, after the Prince of Orange, William street, and after answering three challenges by as many sen tries, reached the front of Jacob Leisler's house. To his surprise he found the well occupied by the soldiers of Van Vow's guard, who were lazily seated about upon the benches around it, under the trees, some of them smoking, others talking, while one of their number paced up and down between the well-curb and the house, acting as sentinel. Logan advanced with precaution, and not seeing any thing of Steiny, he began to entertain some apprehensions as to his fate. Van Vow was also no where visible. Resolved to ascertain, Logan at once assumed the tipsy air of a fisherman who had drank rather too much, and reeled towards them, singing, `I am a fisherman bold and free, I sail a king upon the sea, The blue wide sea!' `Who goes dere?' cried the sentry. `A king!' answered Logan, reeling and speaking in a drunken tone. `A king o' the sea!' `He's a fishermans,' said one of the men on the well-curb. `He ish trunks.' `Drunk! I am not drunk; I am as souber as a judge. Who says I am drunk?' `Stand and give te word!' cried the soldier. `Who are you? What word?' `The pass-wort!' responded the sentry, placing his gun at his breast. `The Prince and the King. Whorray for King Billy.' `He ish a true man,, said the sentry, looking at his comrades for their affirmation. `But he must be take up.' `Yish, he ish true mansh,' was the response. `But ant you te mansh as lost you poat?' `I am the man,' answered Logan, deliberately taking a seat upon one of the benches. `You take me up, eh! I'd thank you to take me over to my island.' `The man dat stole your poat,' said another of the soldiers, taking his pipe out of his mouth and filling it with fresh tobacco, `was the Papist secretary.' `Logan, you mean.' `Yish; they say he gone away in her. He is hid down by te islands.' `No; he went in the ship you may be sure. But what are you doing here.' `Keepin' guart, as you sees.' `On what?' `On te Governor's house.' `Where is your captain?' `He ish in te house. Don't you know he ish Mynheer Van Vow, te burgomeister, ash ish goin' to marry de dochter ov Jacops Leisler?' `What can a poor fishermans know?' said one of the men. `And tipsy at that,' rejoined another with a laugh. `I'm not so drunk as I did not know Mynheer Van Vow is engaged to the new Governor's daughter,' answered Logan. `So he is in there. `Yish; where should he pe put in dere?' answered the soldier, taking a long satisfactory whiff from his pipe. `I'll sit here and smoke with you if one of you will lend me a pipe,' said Logan, placing his hand familiarly on the shoulder of his nearest neighbor. A pipe was very cordially given, and having lighted it, the disguised secretary proceeded to smoke and chat away with the soldiers, artfully drawing from them all they knew touching affairs in the fort, as well as the engagement between the little burgomaster and the beautiful Bertha. From them he learned, also, that no fisher-lad had been seen by them, from which he suspected that Steiny was still in the house, and perhaps unable to escape. He, therefore, had made up his mind to go and kock at the door and ask for him, when the door opened and Van Vow made his appearance in great bodily perturbation. But, before recounting the events that followed his appearance, we will follow Steiny into the house on his mission.— After he had got into the entry, he was met by Bertha, who, with a light in her hand, looked at his face closely, and then told him to follow her. She led him to a small back sitting room, where, having set the light down and closed the door, she said, `Now, good fisher-lad, tell me speedily what this is you have for my private ear.' Steeiny, instead of immediately replying, stood gazing with admiration and wonder upon her extremely beautiful face. He had never seen any thing, as he subsequenty declared, half so handsome. Before he could recover his tongue to reply, a knock was heard at the street door. `There is another,' she said impatiently, as if she did not care to be interrupted. `Brecket,' she said, going to the room door, `go to the upper window and look down and tell me who it is that calls: Now, my boy, thy errand quickly.' `Well, ma'am,' said Steiny, `I'm blowed if your eyes don't make me all of a quirl. They shine jist like two drops o' water sparkling in shells!' `Was that what you had to tell me, you freckled little rogue, hey?' said Bertha laughing. `No, that's my own errand; but what I have to tell you, comes from another guess sort o' person than Steiney Sneek.' `Who can it be? Who sent you?' `Ma'am!' cried Brecket, appearing at the door. `Well.' `It is the burgomaster.' `The plague! What says he?' `He wants to come in, and smoke his pipe with you,' said Brecket, delivering also, the whole of Van Vow's message; to which, Bertha, with an annoyed air, sent the reply, already recorded, as delivered by Brecket from the window, to the philosophical Van Vow. `Now, my boy, who sent thee?' inquired Bertha, closing the door; `sit down and tell me.' `I'm afraid you wont like to hear.' `Then you should not have thought of giving me a message, improper for me to listen to,' she said, reproachingly, and with a maiden's reserve. `It aint cozactly improper, ma'am, but it might'nt please you.' `Why not. Tell me who it is from?' she asked with a considerable degree of curiosity, yet, not with too much eagerness. `To tell you who it is, is the who,' responded Steiney, very intelligibly. `How oddly you talk. I shall send you away, and let whoever gave you a message to me, find some other person to deliver it; for I see I can get nothing from you.' `Well, I'll tell you, if you'll promise not to be angry.' `I promise you!' responded Bertha, still, wholly at a loss to guess who had sent him, though it would be doing Logan injustice, to say, that he did not once enter into her mind, as she ran over in her thoughts, the probabilities of who might be the person. `You know feyther had his boat stole.' `Yes, and you have been paid for it, three marks and a half.' `Do you know who stole the boat?' `How should I?' `Well, I know,' answered Steiney, significantly. `Then, why do you not secure the thief?' `I've got him.' `You have?' she exclaimed with surprise. `Yes.' `Then, where is your boat?' `I've got that, to.' `And your three marks and a half!— You are a young rogue, sirrah.' `Dont call me names, ma'am. Here's your money agen, if that's all makes you talk.' `I don't want it. What have you said you wished to see me for? You are trifling with me.' `No, I ain't. I like you too well for that. You see I come here, to tell you I got the thief.' `And why do you thing it necessary to tell me?' `Because, I guess as how you'd like to know.' `How troublesome you act. If you have anything to say, out with it.' `Well, you see father's skiff was down by the ditch, at the back o' the fort, this mornin', where he left it, and when he went after it, to go home, for we lives down on Governor's island, he found it gone. He hunted heaven and earth for it, and then took to swearin' and gets drunk. Well, he did'nt find it in tipsy town, and so when he gets sober agen, which he did, arter two hours' nap; he goes to the new Governor, your dad, I guess he be. He tells the Governor, and—' `But what has this to do with message you had to me?' `Well, a good deal, because the message is from the thief.' `From the thief!' `Yes. You see, we cocht him down at the island with the boat, coz he did'nt know he was comin with it, right where it belonged. So we grabbed him, and when feyther got home in a neighbor's boat, we built a gallows, as high as a ship's mast, to hang him on.' `Hang him for stealing a boat,' she cried, with a shudder. `Sartain ma'am.' `But it would be murder, without the law. Are you fishermen heathens?' `Not quite, ma'am. But he stole the boat without law, and we mean to hang him without law. That's what we calls even: and then he deserves to be hanged besides, cause he is a papist.' `That is bad, but still, you have no right to hang him. I am glad you let me know this. I will at once see my father, and he will take the matter in hand.' `And he will hang him, sure.' `If he does, it will be by the law.' `Wall, I reckon yon would'nt like to have him hung, law or no law, if you guessed who it was.' `Do I know?' `You've seen him, and he's seen you. He is the man that sent me to you, to see if you would try and save his neck.' `Who is it? If the poor wretch were a total stranger to me, I would try to save him. But, he says he has seen me. Is he one of the towns folk?' `Yes.' `Hang him for stealing a canoe!' `Yes, he'll be hanged, unless you can do something for him. He asked us to spare his life, till he could send word to you; and gave us fifty dollars to do it, that's why I come to know what you would do for him.' `A man who could pay fifty dollars, steal a canoe. This is strange! What is his name? I will save him if I can.— It is horrible to hang a man so barbarously, were he the veriest wretch on earth. What name has he?' `Robert Logan,' answered Steiney, in a quiet tone, closely watching the effect of the name upon her countenance.</field>

There let it rest.' `There is one thing I would ask of you, Colonel Bayard?' said Livingstone in an impressive manner. `I will hear you, my dear sir.' `If the Roman Catholics rise in a body to overthrow Leisler without your co-operation, will you remain passive? If you assist not us, will you refuse to assist them?' `This you may depend upon. But I also will put a question to you Mr. Logan? If I raise a party to overturn Leisler before you make any such movement, will you remain passive?' `We will remain passive so far as that we will not aid Leisler against you; but I boldly assure you, Colonel,' continued Logan with a resolute air, `that if you overthrow Leisler and assume his authority, I shall feel it my duty to endeavour by overturning your governmant to re-establish that which he has usurped!' `We then understand one another,' answered Colonel Bayard in a fearless, frank manner. The two Catholic gentlemen now took their leave with courtesy, and were let out of the door by their host, who gave to each of them his hand as if they were between the utmost harmony on all points. `We have gained one thing by this visit,' said Logan, as they passed down the avenue; `and this is the knowledge that Bayard contemplates a revolution; and that we can't act too speedily. We have to fear him, quite as much as Leisler!' `The politics of our poor Province,' said Livingstone, `are in a strange way. Three parties, and nearly equal in strength, are about to divide and tear the land! But it is fortunate for us that the protestants are at dissension. United, we should be defeated by them; but dissevered as they are we can singly oppose them. It is well we did not unfold all our plan to Bayard. He might have betrayed it, because we are papists, especially if he found that he could not get his party in force to prevent our attack on Sunday. You were very prudent to check yourself as you did!' `I perceived that he had no sympathy with us, and that the only union that could be between us would be based upon our mutual opposition to Leisler's government. Here we are now at the entrance of the main street. Shall you return to father Stephen's?' `Yes, and report the result of our interview with Bayard! Which way do you take?' `I proceed down in the direction of Maiden Lane.' `Take care of yourself, my friend, or Leisler will have you in his hands. You are aware of the reward he has offered for you?' `Yes. I shall not remain in the town. I have a safe retreat at a fisherman's hut on Governor's Island. I shall, however, be present at Father Stephen's on Saturday night.' The two conspirators then parted, Livingstone following a path along the skirts of the town, which brought him, after five minutes' walk, to the field-gate of the priest's garden; while Logan took the side-walk along a narrow lane, which was subsequently named, after the Prince of Orange, William street, and after answering three challenges by as many sen tries, reached the front of Jacob Leisler's house. To his surprise he found the well occupied by the soldiers of Van Vow's guard, who were lazily seated about upon the benches around it, under the trees, some of them smoking, others talking, while one of their number paced up and down between the well-curb and the house, acting as sentinel. Logan advanced with precaution, and not seeing any thing of Steiny, he began to entertain some apprehensions as to his fate. Van Vow was also no where visible. Resolved to ascertain, Logan at once assumed the tipsy air of a fisherman who had drank rather too much, and reeled towards them, singing, `I am a fisherman bold and free, I sail a king upon the sea, The blue wide sea!' `Who goes dere?' cried the sentry. `A king!' answered Logan, reeling and speaking in a drunken tone. `A king o' the sea!' `He's a fishermans,' said one of the men on the well-curb. `He ish trunks.' `Drunk! I am not drunk; I am as souber as a judge. Who says I am drunk?' `Stand and give te word!' cried the soldier. `Who are you? What word?' `The pass-wort!' responded the sentry, placing his gun at his breast. `The Prince and the King. Whorray for King Billy.' `He ish a true man,, said the sentry, looking at his comrades for their affirmation. `But he must be take up.' `Yish, he ish true mansh,' was the response. `But ant you te mansh as lost you poat?' `I am the man,' answered Logan, deliberately taking a seat upon one of the benches. `You take me up, eh! I'd thank you to take me over to my island.' `The man dat stole your poat,' said another of the soldiers, taking his pipe out of his mouth and filling it with fresh tobacco, `was the Papist secretary.' `Logan, you mean.' `Yish; they say he gone away in her. He is hid down by te islands.' `No; he went in the ship you may be sure. But what are you doing here.' `Keepin' guart, as you sees.' `On what?' `On te Governor's house.' `Where is your captain?' `He ish in te house. Don't you know he ish Mynheer Van Vow, te burgomeister, ash ish goin' to marry de dochter ov Jacops Leisler?' `What can a poor fishermans know?' said one of the men. `And tipsy at that,' rejoined another with a laugh. `I'm not so drunk as I did not know Mynheer Van Vow is engaged to the new Governor's daughter,' answered Logan. `So he is in there. `Yish; where should he pe put in dere?' answered the soldier, taking a long satisfactory whiff from his pipe. `I'll sit here and smoke with you if one of you will lend me a pipe,' said Logan, placing his hand familiarly on the shoulder of his nearest neighbor. A pipe was very cordially given, and having lighted it, the disguised secretary proceeded to smoke and chat away with the soldiers, artfully drawing from them all they knew touching affairs in the fort, as well as the engagement between the little burgomaster and the beautiful Bertha. From them he learned, also, that no fisher-lad had been seen by them, from which he suspected that Steiny was still in the house, and perhaps unable to escape. He, therefore, had made up his mind to go and kock at the door and ask for him, when the door opened and Van Vow made his appearance in great bodily perturbation. But, before recounting the events that followed his appearance, we will follow Steiny into the house on his mission.— After he had got into the entry, he was met by Bertha, who, with a light in her hand, looked at his face closely, and then told him to follow her. She led him to a small back sitting room, where, having set the light down and closed the door, she said, `Now, good fisher-lad, tell me speedily what this is you have for my private ear.' Steeiny, instead of immediately replying, stood gazing with admiration and wonder upon her extremely beautiful face. He had never seen any thing, as he subsequenty declared, half so handsome. Before he could recover his tongue to reply, a knock was heard at the street door. `There is another,' she said impatiently, as if she did not care to be interrupted. `Brecket,' she said, going to the room door, `go to the upper window and look down and tell me who it is that calls: Now, my boy, thy errand quickly.' `Well, ma'am,' said Steiny, `I'm blowed if your eyes don't make me all of a quirl. They shine jist like two drops o' water sparkling in shells!' `Was that what you had to tell me, you freckled little rogue, hey?' said Bertha laughing. `No, that's my own errand; but what I have to tell you, comes from another guess sort o' person than Steiney Sneek.' `Who can it be? Who sent you?' `Ma'am!' cried Brecket, appearing at the door. `Well.' `It is the burgomaster.' `The plague! What says he?' `He wants to come in, and smoke his pipe with you,' said Brecket, delivering also, the whole of Van Vow's message; to which, Bertha, with an annoyed air, sent the reply, already recorded, as delivered by Brecket from the window, to the philosophical Van Vow. `Now, my boy, who sent thee?' inquired Bertha, closing the door; `sit down and tell me.' `I'm afraid you wont like to hear.' `Then you should not have thought of giving me a message, improper for me to listen to,' she said, reproachingly, and with a maiden's reserve. `It aint cozactly improper, ma'am, but it might'nt please you.' `Why not. Tell me who it is from?' she asked with a considerable degree of curiosity, yet, not with too much eagerness. `To tell you who it is, is the who,' responded Steiney, very intelligibly. `How oddly you talk. I shall send you away, and let whoever gave you a message to me, find some other person to deliver it; for I see I can get nothing from you.' `Well, I'll tell you, if you'll promise not to be angry.' `I promise you!' responded Bertha, still, wholly at a loss to guess who had sent him, though it would be doing Logan injustice, to say, that he did not once enter into her mind, as she ran over in her thoughts, the probabilities of who might be the person. `You know feyther had his boat stole.' `Yes, and you have been paid for it, three marks and a half.' `Do you know who stole the boat?' `How should I?' `Well, I know,' answered Steiney, significantly. `Then, why do you not secure the thief?' `I've got him.' `You have?' she exclaimed with surprise. `Yes.' `Then, where is your boat?' `I've got that, to.' `And your three marks and a half!— You are a young rogue, sirrah.' `Dont call me names, ma'am. Here's your money agen, if that's all makes you talk.' `I don't want it. What have you said you wished to see me for? You are trifling with me.' `No, I ain't. I like you too well for that. You see I come here, to tell you I got the thief.' `And why do you thing it necessary to tell me?' `Because, I guess as how you'd like to know.' `How troublesome you act. If you have anything to say, out with it.' `Well, you see father's skiff was down by the ditch, at the back o' the fort, this mornin', where he left it, and when he went after it, to go home, for we lives down on Governor's island, he found it gone. He hunted heaven and earth for it, and then took to swearin' and gets drunk. Well, he did'nt find it in tipsy town, and so when he gets sober agen, which he did, arter two hours' nap; he goes to the new Governor, your dad, I guess he be. He tells the Governor, and—' `But what has this to do with message you had to me?' `Well, a good deal, because the message is from the thief.' `From the thief!' `Yes. You see, we cocht him down at the island with the boat, coz he did'nt know he was comin with it, right where it belonged. So we grabbed him, and when feyther got home in a neighbor's boat, we built a gallows, as high as a ship's mast, to hang him on.' `Hang him for stealing a boat,' she cried, with a shudder. `Sartain ma'am.' `But it would be murder, without the law. Are you fishermen heathens?' `Not quite, ma'am. But he stole the boat without law, and we mean to hang him without law. That's what we calls even: and then he deserves to be hanged besides, cause he is a papist.' `That is bad, but still, you have no right to hang him. I am glad you let me know this. I will at once see my father, and he will take the matter in hand.' `And he will hang him, sure.' `If he does, it will be by the law.' `Wall, I reckon yon would'nt like to have him hung, law or no law, if you guessed who it was.' `Do I know?' `You've seen him, and he's seen you. He is the man that sent me to you, to see if you would try and save his neck.' `Who is it? If the poor wretch were a total stranger to me, I would try to save him. But, he says he has seen me. Is he one of the towns folk?' `Yes.' `Hang him for stealing a canoe!' `Yes, he'll be hanged, unless you can do something for him. He asked us to spare his life, till he could send word to you; and gave us fifty dollars to do it, that's why I come to know what you would do for him.' `A man who could pay fifty dollars, steal a canoe. This is strange! What is his name? I will save him if I can.— It is horrible to hang a man so barbarously, were he the veriest wretch on earth. What name has he?' `Robert Logan,' answered Steiney, in a quiet tone, closely watching the effect of the name upon her countenance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. THE FAIR BORROWER. At the name uttered by Steiney, the maiden started with looks of deep surprise and alarm. The color fled from her cheeks and her lips parted with a tremulous effort to speak. Steiny, albeit, not skilled in the emotions of the female heart, was not so inexperienced as not to discover that Robert Logan was far from being an indifferent person to her. `Do you mean to say,' she said in a low impressive, earnest tone, as if she trusted she should not find her fears confirmed by his answer, `do you mean to say that this person is the Secretary of the late Governor; or it is only some individual bearing the same name?' `It is Logan the Secretary, ma'm,' answered Steiney, firmly. `Do you charge him with stealing your boat?' she asked, pale and anxious; for she had not yet heard the rumor that Logan had been seen rowing away in a fisher's skiff, her belief having been that he had got away in the ship. `Yah. I'll tell you how it was. He was driven hard, you sees, and findin' feyther's scow on the shore he jumps in it and pulls out o' the way while every body was busy on the other side o' the fort!' `But that was not stealing! He fled to save his life!' she said with an imploring air, looking in the youth's face. `I don't know what you call it. I found him down by the island with the boat. So when he told us who he was—' `Then he told you his name?' `Yah; and when we know'd it was the papist we resolved to hang him.' `Then you would have hanged him for being a Roman, not for stealing?' `We would ha' hanged him for both!' `How dreadful! Where is he? Did he send you to me?' `Well, he's safe. He han't hung yet. He said if I would come and tell you about him he'd give me fifty dollars, and he believed you could interfere to save him. It would be a pity to hang him, for he seems a proper nice chappy!' `How dreadful! What fearful times are these when men and boys even think so lightly of hanging a fellow-being,' cried Bertha, clasping her hands in anguish. `What said he?' `He wanted me to tell you that he had fallen into the hands of some fishermen. who have resolved to hang him to-morrow morning by nine o'clock, unless you send to them one thousand dollars!' `Money?' she cried with looks of delight. `Oh, tell me will money buy his life?' `One thousand dollars will, ma'm!' `You shall have it.' `When?' `Within an hour. I will get it and save him. I am rejoiced. What a load is lifted from my heart! for I knew not,' she said to herself, `how I should plead to my father for the life of a man for whom he himself has offered a reward!' `Yes,' said Steiny who heard her last words; `I hear the Governor has offered a pretty sum for him! But if you'll give the thousand you shall have him! If you dont, he swings!' `You shall certainly have it,' she answered, `Money for life, oh yes!' But hardly had she spoken these words when her countenance fell. `How shall I get this large sum? My father is rich, but what can I say to him if I ask him for it. No, he must not know the use I have for it. I can make him no answer! Alas! I am in as great a strait as before! Ah, I see. I have the way to obtain it,' she said with joyful animation. `Lad, you shall have the money. But what surety have I that his life shall be spared?' `I want first to see the cash; but afore I takes the money out o' the house I'll bring him into it where you can see him. I'll leave him with you and then lug off the silver!' `Bring him here?' she cried with a start and blush of surprise. `Yah. He wouldn't be safe no where else in the town. Besides, I know he'd like to see you and thank you. He speaks of you so handsome!' `Did he?' `If ever a gentleman loved a lady that ere man love you, ma'm!' `I have scarcely seen him.' `But he has seen you. He told me all about it, when I said I didn't believe he'd ever spoke to you and he was sendin' me to you on a flim-flam cruise!' `What did he say that I loved him?' she asked, blushing. `He said he was afraid you didn't; but that didn't make any difference, he should love you till he died. And now I remember he said he shouldn't so much mind being hanged, only he didn't like to leave you. He said if you was dead he'd be obliged to us to hang him, as where you was was his world! That's the way he talked, ma'm, when we was about to string him up!' `Thank Heaven that he thought of me at that moment if it has saved him from such a dreadful death!' `Yes, you saved his life, no doubt, ma'm; and I guess he'll love you a hundred times more for it, for if it had'nt been that he loved you and spoke about you, he'd 'a been in kingdom-come before now!' `Poor young gentleman! And did he say he loved me?' she asked, not disguising her feelings from the boy as if he had been older, in which case she would have been more reserved. But the boy, unknown to her, had the keen observing eye and acute perception of a man. `Did he speak thus kindly of me?' `Yah, more than I can say, for I can't put it into the fine language he spoke, coz I'm no scholard. But he'd go his death for you, ma'm, and no mistake!' Rude as this expression was, Bertha's ear caught only the spirit of it, and her heart thrilled at the sweet thought that she was loved, and loved by one whose image had many and many a night mingled in her dreams. She never dreamt about the burgomaster. `Oh joy, joy!' said she in the depth of her heart; `he loves me whom I love!' `Well, ma'm, you say you'll give the thousand?' interrupted Steiny, bluntly. `If you can't get it he swings you know.' She started. She seemed all at once to be recalled to the realities and difficulties involving her. `The money; without it he dies!' were echoed from the depths of her being. She stood irresolute and thoughtful. She seemed to be revolving some painful subject in her mind. Something that called the quick color of conscious wrong-doing to her cheek; something from which her frank and generous nature seemed to shrink. `Without the money he dies!' seemed to swell into a voice of thunder in her heart. `It must be done!' she cried quickly and earnestly; `the circumstances will excuse it. There is no alternative—no escape!' `No, ma'm there is no escape,' answered Steiny, catching at the word. `Young man,' she cried firmly, `you shall have the money; wait here!' `I wonder now,' said he, in a tone of affected indifference, `if for any other chappy as was to be hung we people down on the island could get a thousand dollars to save him.' `Any other!' she repeated; `I cannot speak of any other. I should not be called upon, I hope, to judge in any other case. In this one I am ready to act and do all I can.' `So I see. I was only thinkin if any poor devil who was to be hanged could be bought off the gallows by callin on you, I'd let em offer to let em hang me and then pocket the thousand. But I rayther think I'd suffer some afore you'd give a hundred for me.' Bertha smiled, but with a look of anxiety, for her thoughts were busy. `If I give this money to you for Robert Logan's life, will the world know it?' she said, laying her hand upon his shoulder and looking closely into his eyes. `No ma'm; it'll be kept secret; for it would come as hard on us when a new Governor comes, if we let it out, as on you for buying a papist!' `A papist!' she repeated within herself, as if the words struck her ear with a new and strange meaning. `True he is a papist. I have never thought of that. But he must be saved, though he be no more to me nor I to him than we are now. There is more need that he be saved and not die in his errors. Poor noble young gentleman. Oh, that I knew how to act! That I could confide in my father! But I can make nothing known to him. What do I contemplate doing! I, his own daughter, am seeking to save a papist—a man whom he seeks to destroy! If I am detected I am a traitress! Nay I am even now a traitress to him and to the new king. Yet this young man must not die! Oh, no! I will save him! How little did I know my own heart till his danger comes and presses upon it. And he loves me too! How my heart fills with joy as a fountain overrunning!' `I'm waitin for you to get the money,' said Steiny, who, the false, lying rogue, had by this time got sufficient proof of the love of the new Governor's daughter for the young secretary, but who wished at the same time shrewdly and cunningly to carry out a private matter for his own especial and individual interest. `You shall have it,' she replied with decision. `Will you await me here?' `How long?' `Some ten, twenty minutes—I cannot say how long. There is a book to amuse you while I am absent from the room.' As she spoke she took down from a shelf a large thick folio and laid it before him on the table, opening it at the same time to show him that it contained plates. It was a volume of the Book of Martyrs, and the picture to which she opened being a graphic representation of certain grim inquisitors boiling a victim in a cauldron of oil, drew Steiny's attention at once, and he manifested his astonishment by a low prolonged whistle at a spectacle that quite surpassed any thing in his juvenile experience. Steiny could not read, but pictures are their own interpreters, as the young gentleman's exclamation sufficiently attested: `Injuns makin a chowder out o' a white man, if they ant I'm a whale!' He was soon so deeply interested in the mysteries of a book that will perpetuate to all time the deepest crimes that have ever disgraced humanity, that he quite forgot where he was, and gave vent in an original and indistinct phraseology to his emotions as scene after scene rose to his view, in a way that would have called both frowns and smiles on the face of Father Stephen had he been an unseen looker on. As soon as Bertha had placed the book before him she left the room, and taking a candle from the table in the hall she opened a door on the opposite side which took her into a large and handsome parlor, furnished in the old Dutch style,— The history of the life of Christ was pictured in blue on square tiles, set in around the fire-place; a cuckoo clock stood above the mantel that, just as she entered struck nine, when out flew a cuckoo, who flapped his wings and sung his song; but which, ere well finished, was interupted by a trooper who, mounted on horseback, charged the bird sword in hand, and drove it at a little door, which obligingly flew open to shelter it, whereupon the trooper, after brandishing his sword, fiercely wheeled his charger, retreated, and disappeared as he came, by an opposite door, that opened to receive and shut him in. About the room hung portraits of the three preceding generations of the Leislers, one of them, who was painted in armor, showed by the bars of his visor that he was a baron. In truth, the lineage of the fair Bertha was a noble one. Having entered the room, she closed the door, placed the candle upon a dark-colored, polished stand, supported by three lion's feet, and then gave herself up to several minutes' deep reflection— At length she spoke out with emphasis in the following manner:— `It must be done. I will listen no longer to any whispers of conscience.— A life depends on it—a life worth a thousand lives like his. It is right to deceive him—it is right to use him. Has he not annoyed me long, and I have had patience with? I will test his love now; but it shall only be a loan: he shall be repaid. Robert Logan is rich and will repay it, though now he cannot, it would seem, command the sum. What confidence he has shown in me by sending to me. Alas! that he should be a Papist! This saddens my thoughts; yet, though I may never see him, save when he shall come hither, he shall be saved! Oh, how shall I rejoice to know, to feel that he owes his life to me! Am I to see him? Ought I to see him? How else shall I know this lad has given the money over to the fishermen who hold him in custody, thirsting for his blood.' Poor Bertha! she was deceived in all this we know. Her fears were groundless; yet her love was not the less sincere for being awakened and called forth by forged evils to him she loved. `I will see him here, if I obtain the money, before I give it up, that I may know he is safe. I would shrink from seeing him; but I wish to speak with him and urge him to give up his erroneous faith, considering how near he has been to death. From me, to whom he will owe his safety, he may take a few words kindly. Perhaps they may do him good and save his soul (Oh, that he was not a Papist!) I will then advise him to leave the province till the danger is past. Each moment that he lingers here I shall tremble for him.' Perhaps Bertha, if she had very closely questioned herself, could not have given a satisfactory reason why it was at all necessary that she should see the young secretary. But in her heart there was an earnest, an ardent desire to see and speak with him after he should escape, if only one word. But it is not delicate to analyze too closely a young maiden's heart. A second time she said emphatically, as if she had come to a decision which could not be moved, `It shall be done; there is no alternalive. The burgomaster's vanity shall administer to my present need. If it be wrong to deceive him, it is a greater wrong that Robert Logan should die by the hands of these fierce men who have him in their power.' Thus speaking, she softly raised the window next to the stoope, and noiselessly pushed open the shutters. She carefully glanced out into tue moon-lit street. There stood in the middle of it the burgomaster's guards, each man with a pipe in his mouth, silently smoking and in line. She opened the shutter still farther, so she could command a view of the stoope. There, upon one of its benches, she discovered the portly figure of Mynheer Van Vow, her warlike lover. He was reclining with one arm hanging over the balustrade, his head resting against the door-post, his eyes closed, and his pipe out. He was plainly fast asleep, good, easy man, thus to take so gently love's reverses. By him stood his great sword, resting against his breast, where it rose and fell with every pulsation of his deep and sonorous breathing. `There sleeps he, that lump of vanity and good-natured simplicity,' said she. `I am sorry I have to deceive thee, worthy bbrgomaster; for, though I love thee not, I am not thy enemy. But it is to save a life, and by and by thou shalt have thy gold again. But he loves his money. He may become alarmed at my demand. Courage! I will rouse him up!' Thereupon she whispered softly; but his ears did not hear the voice which would have started Logan from the profoundest repose. `Mynheer Van Vow,' she repeated in a little under tone. The burgomaster replied by a sonorous snore. The maiden laughed, and took from the inside of the room Jacob Leisler's Sunday walking-stick, and with it she punched her lover thrice, each time harder than the preceding. Suddenly he started up, as if conscious of being disturbed. His huge sword fell to the floor of the stoope with an enormous clanging sound, while his pipe dropping to the ground, was smashed into pieces. The noise made by the falling weapon and by the pipe, with the sensation of certain punches in the ribs, combined with a warlike dream of towns taken and sacked, through which the brain of the burgomaster was battling, made him believe that he was in the midst of a real battle.' `Ho! to arms! Death, murders and fires! Help! Deal blows, and don't be afraid of the papists. Down with the pope and protect Bertha.' The sound of his voice, his words, and his confusion, startled his soldiers. They rushed forward, with their match-locks presented; when, seeing no one but the burgomaster, who was brandishing his sword terribly, the corporal, a man of sense and nerve, saw into the matter at once, `Mynheer, you have been dreaming. There is no battle.' `Ant they?' answered Van Vow, dropping the point of his sword. `I thought I vas taking von towns at least.' `It was a dream, burgomaster, for a minute ago you was asleep: then I saw you up, dealing blows about, and shouting.' `Bless my souls and podies, so it vas a dreams. But vas'nt I prave in te dreams though? Did'nt I show valors and fightins.' `You did bravely,' answered the corporal. `It vas goot for te enemies it vas a dreams,' said the burgomaster, with a vain air. Bertha had instantly closed the shutter, and no one discovered the cause of the burgomaster's alarm. It was now very natural that she should go to the door to learn the cause, for she wished to get speech of him. So she opened it a little, and said, `Mynheer Van Vow, what has happened?' `Happened, lights o' my eyes! dont venture out till all is safes.' `What is the danger?' `Dangers! Battles and vars! Vel it is you had such brave soldiers and varriors as Slems Van Vow, to keep garts here. Why the papists have been here, ten thousand ov em if dere vas no mans ov em, and dey would haf carried you off, pody and soul. But I defended you wit my lifes, and dere is not one on em to pe seen, showin his face on te face ov te earth.' `I am greatly indebted to you,' answered Bertha. `It was only a dream, Miss Bertha,' cried the corporal; `so dont have fears of any thing.' `Out ov te vay,' cried the burgomaster angrily; `he vas asleep, and knows notting, dear eyes.' `Well, I am thankful for my escape. Come in Slems, that I may thank you in better words than standing here.' `You goes apout your pizzinesses, corporals Veckings,' said Slems; `see tat you keeps better vatch. Come in, fair dat ish to pe.' With this gallant speech, the burgomaster entered the house. Bertha closed the door, and led him into the parlor.— She was afraid that the boy, Steiney, would have been alarmed by the uproar, and she should have met him in the hall; but he was too deeply interested in the study of the history of Moses tiled on the fire-jam, to heed any noise; for, having got through with the Martyrs, he gave the same undivided attention to the latter, which he had bestowed upon the former; pictures, being a treat of rare occurrence to the young fisher's boy. Bertha having got Slems into the parlor, and shut the door, taken his hat, and laid it aside, and treated him with such smiling hospitality that, taking it altogether, in her full belief in his having risked his life, fighting for her, against an attack of the papists, as he had told her, he half repented himself, of his fibbing; for Slems had a conscience. But she gave him no time to act from its dictates, and dishonor himself, by confessing the truth. `My dear good Slems,' said Bertha, seating herself by his side, and looking up into his face in the most bewitching way. `What, sweet Bertha,' answered the burgomaster, feeling his brain swim and reel under her bright glances, as if champaigne were in it. `Bless me, what a happy thing it is, to thinks you and I are to pe married, hey?' and the barbarian tapped her under the pretty chin, with two of his fat fingers. `This, doubtless, you often think upon,' she said, in the most delicious tones in the world; and she smiled with the most bewildering witchery. Slems would not have been mortal to have withstood her. `I never smoke mine bipe, but I sees you dancing in te blue wreathes, Bertha, love o' my heart, dears,' he said, with emotion. `How happy I ought to be! Do you know, dear Slems, that I think you a very brave man.' `Does you, indeed. A brave mans.— That is what makes me knows you loves me, Berthas. But no! I'll pe honest.— I'm a cow—' `Don't say one syllable more,' she exclaimed, pressing her pretty hand over his mouth. `How many days is it, before we are to be married?' `Thirteen, the day after to-morrows.' `Why don't you say fifteen from to-day?' `Coz I wishes, pretty Berthas, to make it short as possible.' `Well, I believe you love me, Slems, but I want proof of it.' `Take mine lifes. Here is mine big swort.' `No: I will take what I know you value as much.' `Vat it ish?' `Money!' `Moneies?' `Yes. I need a thousand silver dollars, for some purpose, no matter what; if it is only to test your love for me.— Now, Slems Van Vow,' she added, assuming a gay air, while her heart throbbed heavily, `if you truly love me, you will not refuse to let me have this little sum;' she said, fixing her eyes earnestly upon his face, as if she would read in its fleshy rotundity, his very soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. THE NEGOTIATION. The burgomaster gazed upon the beautiful little Dutch maiden with his eyes expanded to their fullest periphery. It is not certain whether he was the most amazed at her demand or at her denominating a thousand dollars a `little' sum. `Well, Slems, have you heard me? she said impatiently. `Shall I repeat my words?' `Bless my souls and podies, Berthas!' `Well, what is the matter?' `You dont pe earnests?' `I never was more so!' she said very positively. `One tousants tollars!' `Slems Van Vow,' cried Bertha, repeating the burgomaster's name with emphasis. `Vat, Berthas!' `You have professed to love me. You are worth twenty thousand dollars. I ask you to give proof of your love to lend me one thousand until the day we are married.' `One tousant tollars ish great deal monish.' `What do you think I am worth?— Will you give me up and let me marry another for half you are worth?' `No, tunder and blixens! Who will you marries?' cried the burgomaster, alarmed as if the imagined husband of Bertha stood before him. `Well, now you expect to get me, whom you profess to value so highly, while you look as if you were going to be robbed when I, to test your love, ask you to let me have such a trifle as a thousand dollars.' `Is it only to test my loves, Berthas?' said the burgomaster, who had really begen to be alarmed; for next to Bertha Leisler, he loved his money. `I will not indulge you by replying to this suspicious question. If you cant trust me I will try some one else. I dare say I could find some handsome young gentleman in the town who would gladly let me have a great deal more than that, if I would consent to marry him!' `You cant marry any podies but me,' answered the burgomaster very positively. `I shall not ask you, Mynheer Van Vow,' she said pouting with partly real anger and partly affected pique. `So good evening, sir. I will leave you to your pipe, which I know very well you love more than you do me!' And thus speaking she rose to go.— Slems looked after her as she slowly went towards the door. Love for Bertha got the mastery over love of money. `You ant goings, Berthas!' he said deprecatingly. `Indeed I am. If you cant let me have this little sum you cant love me.' `I does love you, Berthas! You shall have it; but,' he added cautiously as she returned to him smiling, `but you only means to tries me, heh? I sees it ish! So you shall have it, Berthas. But you will lock it ups in a box ant gives me te keys till we gets married!' `I shant promise any such thing. If you cant trust me, I can't trust you? So, if you ever expect to find favor in my eyes, Mynheer Van Vow, you will act like a true lover and give me the money.' `Bless my souls! Must you have it to-morrows?' `To-night;' she answered very firmly. `To-nichts!' he repeated with simple amazement. `What can you wants wit moniesh—so mush miesh to-nicht?' `If you let me have the money you must ask no questions. You must just trust me. I want the money this very hour!' `I hant got so much moniesh apout me!' `You have twice as much in your iron box at home. Don't you remember one day you counted it out to show me how rich you were? Now not a word more. Go at once and get the money and bring it to me in gold!' `Vell, I must do it, I sposhe,' he sighed. `But you'll give it pack agen vhen you knows I love you; vor if I didn't loves you, dear Berthas, I wouldn't let you have so mush moniesh!' `If you get it at once and bring it to me I shall know you love me and never doubt you again!' `Den I gets it richt away vor you; pecause you only vishes to try me, and vhen you gets it you keeps it a little ant gif it pack to me agens!' With these words the burgomaster rose to his feet. Bertha shook his hand and called him `good Slems,' and his face shone with joy, as he looked upon her and thought how happy he was at the idea of having such a sweet pretty maiden become vrow Van Vow. `Now dont stay, Slems. Be just as quick as you can,' she said, going out of the door and pushing him as he went to hurry him. `I shall expect you back in twenty minutes, as it is only a few steps to your house!' `Will you kiss me, Berthas, when I come back?' he said, stopping full. `Let me see you back first. Hasten!' `Pless me, vat a hurrys you pe in. Vat te tyfil can you vant me to go avter it to-nicht!' `Don't swear, Slems, its wicked!' she said as she opened the street door to let him out. `But —' She would not let him speak, but fairly shoved him out upon the stoope and closed the door after him. `Tousant tollars!' he ejaculated as he recovered his equilibrium. `She ish vera extravagants!' The burgomaster then called upon two of his soldiers to act as a body-guard and marched off on his reluctant errand in the direction of his own abode, where he dwelt with his mother, a little hunchbacked Dutch dame, who thought there was no person equal to her son upon the earth's round ball. But mother's heroes are always the world's fools. `Now my heart is relieved,' cried Bertha, clapping her hands as she closed the door upon the burgomaster. `Now he will be saved. In less than three hours' time he will be out of the power of those horrid fishermen, and, perhaps, I may see him here. But I dare not think about it. It is wrong, I fear, to think about it. He is a Papist, too. But I will never marry this simple burgomaster—never, never! Have I done wickedly in deceiving him? But what else could I do! I could not tell him what I needed the money for!— But he shall have it back again! It seems a pity to take advantage of the poor man's love for me to do a favor to one whom I truly love, and who loves me! But there is a life at risk, and all other considerations must yield to the emergency. By and by, when the young secretary is safe, I will confess all to Slems and ask his pardon, perhaps. But I fear my fisher-boy has got tired looking at the martyrs all this time.' She opened the door of the little back parlor, where she had left Steiny busy examining the pictures in the Book of Martyrs. She entered softly to see what he was doing, and, to her surprise and alarm, saw him very busily engaged in fishing with a pin hook for four or five jet gold fish in a glass globe. `Why, what are you doing?' she exclaimed, running up to rescue her favorites, `and what is this you've got? My net purse, as I'm alive. You've killed my fish.' `What be I doin'? I'm catchin' these here shiners,' he answered very coolly, drawing out her last fish as she spoke, by means of her purse, of which he had made a dip-net, by fastening it to the end of a fork. All the fish lay panting upon the table. She gazed upon them with horror and grief. `What have you done?' `Cocht every one on 'em clean. I tried the hook first, you see, and then made this here dip-net, which works first rate. What pretty fish they be. I never seed none o' 'em like 'em down the bay.' `I wish you'd been down the bay,' cried Bertha quickly, taking them up, one by one, and putting them back in the globe. One of them turned over on his back and lay quiet. The other three, after performing sundry eccentric man œuvres, seemed to dart about again quite as lively as ever. `How could you be so cruel? One of them is dead. You are very bad.' `Well, I didn't know as I was doin' any harm. Fish is made to be cocht all the world over. I seed 'em here, and bein tired lookin at blue pictures and black priests stickin men on forks and harpoons, and I thought I'd catch them here fish, so as not to be idle.' `I'm so sorry.' `Be you? Well, then, I'm d—d if I ant.' `Why, what a boy.' `What have I done now?' he asked with amazement. `You swore.' `Swore! What is swore?' `What a strange creature!' she said, laughing. `Have you got the silver?' `It'll be here soon.' `I'm plaguy glad, coz, you see, I'm tired waitin'. I'll bring you up a tom-cod to-morrow for killin' that are fish as is showin his belly white.' `No matter. I'll forgive you, as you didn't know any better.' In the meanwhile Slems tramped along to his house which was a one-story mansion, with a roof twice as high and almost as steep as the walls. It projected over the door eight feet, supported by columns, leaving a piazza in front. He left his guard at the door, and entered, sighing as he went. He found a light in the room where his mother was, and without replying to any of her questions of alarm, walked straight to his own bedroom. He rolled the bed out from the wall and exposed a small door, which he unlocked. Within was a large iron-bound chest, which was securely fastened by padlocks. He stooped down to it, and, with many a sigh, opened the chest. It took him a quarter of an hour to count out the gold, which he at length effected, relocked the chest, and restored things as they were before. The gold he placed in a leather bag, and carried it out in his hand, though evidently feeling it to be a great weight. It weighed down not only his hand, but his heart. It was the saddest deed ever performed by the burgomaster in his peaceful life. Love and avarice had struggled from the outset, and more than once the latter came near getting the victory. But Slems recalled the bright eyes and sweet voice of Bertha, and love again kicked the beam. At length he reached the house and was admitted. Bertha, when she saw the bag in his hand, was all smiles; for she was really overjoyed. She led him into the parlor, and offered to take the bag from him, as he seemed to be sweating under its weight. But he held firmly on to it. `No, no, Berthas! You seees I hef it. Now, doesn't I loves you?' `You do indeed, Slems.' `Ten 'tis enough. I've pring te money, and tat show you dat I loves you. No dere ish no need tat you haf it.' `Yes, I must have it! I never shall believe you love me, unless you are willing to leave it with me, and not to think of it, nor ask for it, nor say a word about it to any body for seven days.' `Vell, I 'spose I must den lets you haf it,' he said, laying it down upon a chair. She immediately took it up, saying, `Thanks, thanks, good Slems,' and hastened with it from the room. He half rose to call after her, for as he saw it going away his avarice began to take the alarm; but all at once, as if struck with a sense of shame at his want of confidence in her, he sat down again. As he did so she shut to the door, as he heard her turn the key he exclaimed, with misgivings— `Pless my podies!' The next moment Bertha was in the little back parlor. `Here, Steiny, is the money. There is one thousand dollars. Hasten with it,' she said, placing the bag in his hand, which he found so heavy that he instantly let it drop. He, however, raised it again and grappled it with both hands. `How long will it take you to reach the island?' `Not more than half an hour!' `Then go at once. Free him from the power of his captors, and send him hither to-night, that I may know he is freed, for I shall not rest till I have assurance of it. You need not leave the money, as you proposed, for I believe you are honest and will trust you; besides, unless the men you say hold him see the gold, they will not let him come. So take it with you, and do not deceive me, for you see I put perfect confidence in you. As you deceive me so you will have to answer it at the bar of heaven!' `I al'ays keeps clear o' bars, especially at high water, so dont fear me.' `How ignorant the boy is. Come with me. I will show you a way out that will prevent any one from seeing you. When you come back with Mr. Logan to let me know he is safe, for that is all I wish to see him for, you bring him by the same way.' She then led him out by the rear of the house through a small garden, and let him out into a lane that run along between garden fences quite to the water side. Here she parted with him, cautioning him to let her learn within two hours of the safety of the prisoner. This Steiny swore she should do, and then marched off with Slem's `tousan tollar,' his heart as light at his two-fold success, both for Logan's interests and his own, as Slem's had been heavy when he was lugging it from his own house to Bertha's. As soon as Bertha got back into the house, which she re-entered with a bounding and happy heart, she hastened to her prisoner, Slems. `Vhere ish te monish?' he called out. the moment she unlocked the door and made her appearance. `It is safe, dear Slems! you dont know how much I am flattered to think you have put such confidence in me and shown you love me!' `Yesh, I half show it one tousan tollar! Vere ish te bags?' `Dont concern yourself about it at all.' `I hopes it ish safes!' `Dont fear. But you know you were not to think or speak of it under seven days!' `Vell I vont.' `That's a good Slems.' `Now vhere ish te kiss?' he said, holding his round shining cheek towards her. `Did I promise?' `Yesh, you promises;' and the cheek was still presented like a target to an archer's bow. `There then!' she cried, placing adroitly two of her soft fingers, almost as soft as her lips, on his cheek, covering his eyes with her other soft, warm hand, and then kissing her two taper fingers, which as the same moment she tapped upon his cheek. More experienced persons than the burgomaster might have detected the cheat; but Bertha had never kissed the burgomaster, and his cheek had all his life been sacred to the mater nal salutation. It was easy to deceive the inexperienced lover, and he was deceived. Moreover, the innocent young Dutchman did not know that a kiss is a compound article, consisting of two parts; that it is, indeed, the nuptial of the lips. But he was made happy, nevertheless, and began to think, with sparkling eyes, that it was worth a thousand dollars to be kissed by Bertha!— Certainly it was worth this sum to have to kiss him. `Now, Berthas, vhen shall I haf anoder kisses?' he said complacently. `I dont know. But you must'nt smoke in here!' `Vhy not?' he asked, suspending a fresh pipe, which he had taken from his pouch in his hand midway in the air, just as her voice arrested it. `Because it gets into the curtains and embroidery; and besides, your soldiers will be wondering where you are.' `No tey wont; lets em mind teir own pusiness; I'm happy.' `But I must shut up the house!' she continued, resolved to get him off before there was any danger of his coming in contact with Logan. `Den you cans shut me up in it.' `But that would be decidedly improper!' `Ant we to be married in elefen tays after te middle of te next veeks!' `Slems, you will make me vexed!' `I vould'nt for te worlts!' `Then go!' `Bless my podies; who'd think I half ony ten minutes ago let her haf a tousan tollars!' he grumbled, as he rose up and slowly went out. `Vhen shall I sees you agen, and haf anoder kisses?' `Not until you are more obedient!' `Vera vells, I vill goes. I will smokes on te stoopes, ant keeps guarts, tat noting hurt you nor puts you into alarms! Who would tink I haf give her tousant tollar!' he repeated, with strong emphasis, as he went out of the door. `Put I loves her ant vill not make her angrys.' With these words and with looks of very great reluctance and discomposure at being thus summarily ejected from the house by the firm little maiden, he made his appearance at the door. Logan, it will be remembered, was at the moment seated by the well-curb, talking with the soldiers, and beheld him as he came out `There is our Captain,' said the corporal, `he puffs and blows as if he was mad at sometings!' `May I speak to your Captain?' asked Logan. `Yash, dere he ish,' responded the corporal. Logan crossed to the stoope where Slems sat with his sword across his knees muttering words, all that could be distinguished of which was, `tousant tollars.' `Are you the brave Captain Van Vow?' asked Logan. `Bless my podies, here ish a man as speaks like a gentlemans, if he ish a fishersman. Yes, I am the braves ant valiants Captains Van Vow!' answered the burgomaster, condescendingly. `I am glad to see you. Have you seen any thing of my son, a lad of fourteen? He has strayed, and I fear he'll get into mischief in this soldierly town.' `No, I has not seen te lads. Asks mine soltiers.' `They have not.' `Den I dont knows noting apout him. Go thy vays, or I'll put thee into the prisons!' `Where can he be,' thought Logan, as he left the door and walked slowly down the street, resolved to endeavour to get into the house and learn what had become of him. He had reached the corner when Steiny came full upon him. `So, you are safe, then,' he exclaimed. `I was beginning to fear you had got into difficulty. What have you got there so heavy?' `A bag o' rocks to pepper the soldiers with.' `It wont do to assail them. You had best throw it away.' `No, I'll just hide it under this stone here so as to be handy, if I want it.' `Well, do with it as you please, only tell me quickly if you saw the maiden.' Steiny hid the bag under a shelving stone by the fence, where he knew it would be safe for a while, and then turning to Logan gave him, as they walked along out of the way of the guards, a full account of all that had passed, save the negotiation about the money. This, for private reasons, he was inclined to keep a secret. `When I made her think you were about to be hanged,' said Steiny, `she looked as if she would have gived her pretty eyes to save you. She certainly loves you chappy, and all you've got to do is to go ahead. I told her you loved her too, and she's expecting you.' `Where?' `Come, and I'll show you. But you must keep up my game. Make her think you were going to be hanged down on the island for stealing dad's scow, and that you owe your life to her; for I tell'd her for her sake I'd have you let off.' `Did she believe I was in danger?' `Yes, so you must keep it up; coz she'll believe when she sees you that you are free, coz she begged for you!' `She will?' `Yah. But don't say nothin about the money.' `What money?' `Did I say money?' `Yes.' `I meant rocks!' `What rocks?' `Them I got hid there.' “I shant trouble them, boy! But where are you leading me?' `A round about way to get into the house.' `Did she say she wished to see me?' `Did she? Ask her! She said I must bring you, for she could not sleep till she know'd you was safe.' `Sweet, dear Bertha!' `Yah, she is a beauty. She's handsome as a gold fish. If she leaves you alone don't go to fishin after her gold fishes!' `Is this the place?' `Yah, a nice snug little door in the fence. Now keep strait on—turn to the left, go up two steps and knock at the first door you see under the dark gallery. She'll open it. If she's surprised to see you, tell her they brought you over to give you up to the Governor, but let you go when they saw me and had three minutes private talk. Now remember.' `I will, answered Logan, laughing. `And dont mention money and she wont!' continued Steiny as he was entering the gate. `What do you mean?' `She said she'd give a thousand dollars to keep you from bein hurt, that's all. So if you mention money she'll think you've come after it!' `Well, I wont mention money if it will relieve you.' `It will 'mazingly,' answered Steiny coolly. `Be by the boat waiting for me till I come,' said Logan as he was closing the garden door. `I rather think I'll look out and find a safe place for my rocks,' said Steiney hurrying away to the spot where he had deposited his bag of gold. Logan did not knock at the door in the habit of a fisherman. This he took off in the garden, and even went so far as to stop at the cistern and wash his face and hands so as to get rid of his brown complexion. This delay to arrange his toilet will be overlooked by the reader when all the circumstances are taken into consideration. As it was moonlight he used his sword for a mirror to arrange his hair and make himself look presentable. He then advanced to the door and rapped with inconsiderable confidence. `Who is there?' called the rich voice of Bertha within. `One whom you expect!' She well knew the voice. Her heart bounded with delight. He was safe!— How soon had he flown to her to thank her for his life! He was safe! And now that he was no longer in danger should she interest herself in him? Would it be proper to let him come in? These thoughts chased one another rapidly through her mind; and yet she kept turning the lock till the door opened, as it seemed to her, of itself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. THE LOVERS AND THEIR ADVENTURE. To lovers so well prepared as ours were by Steiney's diplomacy, to meet each other on good terms, it must of course be supposed, that that their interview in the `little back parlor,' was mutually delightful. Logan, if he had before loved only, now worshipped. She felt, too, that she could be happy, only with him. For two hours they remained together, the most part of which, she spent in trying to convert him to protestansism. `Will you then be mine, dear beautiful Bertha?' he said, ardently. `I cannot promise. I have told you freely, that you are very dear to me. But I cannot even think of a papist.' `I am half a mind to become a protestant, for your sweet sake. But, really, believing as I do, that you are in an error, a beautiful wandering angel. I cannot leave the ways of truth, to pursue you unless to bring you back to them. Dearly as I love you.' `Do not talk of loving me. It makes me sad, for I feel we can never meet again.' `Nay, this is too dreadful an alterna tive. Instead of trying to persuade me to become a protestant, let me persuade you to become a Roman.' `No, I can never change my faith, if it break my heart,' she said, firmly, but sorrowfully. `I begin to regret that I have suffered you to see me to night. I might have forgotten you, if we had not now met; but now I shall never forget; and so long as we can never love, it will be a source of unhappiness to me, to recur to this hour of happiness. Sir, it is best, we should now part forever.' `No, Bertha. Why should you thus treat me? Why call me hither to dismiss me to wretchedness. For you I will do every thing but forswear my faith. This I cannot do, even for you.' `Your promises, even in error, only makes me esteem, nay love you more.— Every word you utter assures me of your worth, and how much I lose, in refusing to see you mine.' `Alas, that we should both be thus firm. But I fear you do not think well of me, Bertha. Your heart is another's. Your father told me, you were betrothed to a certain rich young burgomaster of the town.' The young maiden's pretty lip slightly curled, with a smile of contempt. `Mr. Logan, if you had ever seen this favorite of my father's, you would not charge me with giving him a thought.— No, my heart was never moved, save by you. But I have told you freely, all my love. Now let us part, and forget the one the other.' `Never, dearest girl.' `Will you, then, change your faith?' `No, ask me not.' `I can never be the wife of a papist, Robert Logan,' she answered firmly. `If I will change my religion?' `I will be your wife, or never wed.' `Give me three days, to think of this.' `Willingly. Oh, that you would, at the end of that time, tell me that you had become a protestant.' `When is the day, you were to have married this burgomaster?' `Two weeks hence. But fear me not. I shall never wed any one, but thee.' After some further conversation, in which Logan briefly stated to her, that he intended to remain for the present, secreted, at the house of father Stephen, whom he intended to consult, touching the matter of changing his faith, he took his leave, pressing her to his heart, and leaving a kiss upon her brow. In the garden, Logan resumed his fisherman's costume, and made his way to the water-side. He found Steiney waiting in the skiff, a little from the land.— He called to him, when the lad, without moving an oar said, doubtfully, `Are you mad with me; if you are I'm off.' `Mad? No, you have done me good service,' answered Logan. `Pull into the shore, and let me get on board.' Steiney obeyed, quite satisfied, from the tone of his voice, that Logan had not discovered the affair of the recent negotiation, he had effected with Bertha. `I am going down to the island, to re main with you until to-morrow evening, and then I think of returning to the town altogether,' said Logan, as he got into the boat. `You did me good service Steiney. You are a useful aid, in affairs of love.' I'm glad you're pleased, chappy,' answered the boy, in the reckless cool way, characteristic of him; and as he spoke, he gave a cautious glance at the cuddie, where his bag of `rocks' was stowed safely away. He then began to sing a tune to which he kept time with his oars. The following morning early, Steiny got his father off in the skiff, before Logan was up; and then he took the opportunity of thoroughly concealing his treasure. During the day a fisherman stopped at the island from town, and reported that there was a rumor that Robert Logan had been in town, and was getting the catholics to rise and take the fort and massacre every protestant. Upon hearing this Logan, surprised at this premature exposure of his plans, despatched Steiny to town to learn the facts. The boy was gone two hours, and upon his return confirmed the statement of the fisherman, adding that soldiers were then searching every place in town for him, and that five hundred dollars had been offered for his head. `I see that the town is no place for me for two or three days,' said Logan, within himself, on hearing this startling intelligence. `I dont see how it got out that I was in town, or how the rumor of the conspiracy got abroad! There was a traitor last night among us at the priest's house!' Logan's suspicions were correct.— The traitor was Courtlandt; who, finding the Roman Catholic party likely to be in the minority, and having the same night received a note from Bayard, who knew his man, proposing to him to join him in establishing a Provincial Government in Albany, he abandoned the papist ranks, to which he had never been a very firm adherent; and in three hours after the breaking up of the meeting at Father Stephen's, he was closeted with Colonel Bayard at his house. Courtlandt proposed that Livingstone should be invited to join them, and at one o'clock in the morning he was sent for.— When he came, and they had laid before him the whole plan, he at once adopted it; and the three joined hands to move a new rebellion against Leisler's. As the catholic party was now in their way, they at once resolved to betray the conspiracy to Leisler, that their hopes might be defeated. A note was therefore sent to him just before dawn, informing him of the intentions of the Romans on the ensuing Sabbath. The note bore no signature, but Leisler saw that it bore the air of truth, and regarded it accordingly. The garrison was doubled, and the strictest vigilance observed every where. Every Roman Catholic was forbidden to appear in the streets without an order or permission from the Governor; and as the note stated that Robert Logan was not only secreted in the city, but was the leader of the conspiracy, the reward to arrest him was largely increased by proclamation, and a search patrol was sent to enter every Roman Catholic house in search of him. The town, throughout the whole day, was in the greatest exbitement. Jacob Leisler removed his daughter to the fortress, both from fear of the catholics and of Robert Logan. The burgomaster also took up his abode in the fort; and greatly did he wonder when Bertha's little baggage was removed, what had become of his `tousant talers;' for he took the trouble to lift each small trunk and box before it was carried into her room; and he was convinced there was no `tousant talers' in any of them. But he said nothing; he only wondered the more.— Once Bertha, who was quietly observing him, discovered that he was about to speak, but putting her fore finger on her lip she shook her head significantly. He was silent, but sighed, and looked amusingly desponding. This evenful day had not yet drawn to a close, when a messenger brought a note to the Governor. It was from Father Stephen, who, having discovered to whom his party owed its betrayal, addressed, in retaliation, a letter to Jacob Leisler, stating that it would become him forthwith to arrest Colonel Bayard, Livingstone and Courtlandt, for they were about to leave the town for Albany, to organise there an opposition Provincial Gevernment. Upon getting this intelligence, which confirmed certain suspicions he had formed, Leisler despatched a force to the abodes of these gentlemen to arrest them and defeat their object in the outset.— But thev had already taken flight. Upon hearing this, Leisler forbade all English protestants from leaving the town under pain of arrest. But this proclamation had little effect. Before daylight nearly every adherent of Bayard had quitted the place. In one respect the perplexed Governor did not regret their departure; for he had now but one party—the Roman Catholic—to oppose him. Still he felt that if Bayard should succeed in raising the standard of William and Mary at Albany, he might lose the Province, and this he did not wish to do, for the merchant Governor now begun to feel the irresistable lust and pride of power. The authority which he had accepted with reluctance he now resolved to hold on to with jealous vigilance. Logan remained on the island still another day and night, not at the fisherman's cabin, but in a deserted Indian's hut, about half a mile from it, where Steiny visited him and provided him with food; for Steiny had heard in town that the Governor intended to send to the islands in search of the escaped Secretary, and he had informed Logan that he and every fisherman who went to the town, was closely questioned about him. Logan therefore kept himself secluded until some favorable opportunity should offer for him to leave his retreat and return once more to town. On the second afternoon Steiny returned and brought the intelligence of Bayard's flight, and the new Government that was to be established at Albany. `But this is not the best news I've got for you,' said the boy. `You see I was no sooner ashore than a sojer takes me by the arm and tells me I must go into the fort and let the Governor talk with me. I told him the Governor had axed me yesterday about the Secretary; but he said that was nothing, and his orders was to take every fisherman to the fort. I thought they'd found you out! But no, the Governor did'nt suspect, he only axed me if I'd seen or heard o' such a person as you since yesterday. In course I told him I did'nt. Well, who should I see but Miss Bertha winking at me. So, as I had my basket o' fish on my arm I goes to the window where she was, and axes her—`Buy any fishes!' She told me to let her see em. So while she was pretending to admire 'em, she whispers, `Do you know where he is?' `Sweet girl,' ejaculated Logan, impassionately. `I winked and blinked, and she understood. So she told me to wait a minute, and in a little while she slipped this bit of paper into my jacket.' `Why did'nt you tell me before. Let me see it.' `I told you as soon as I could. What a hurry.' `Logan snatched the note and read:— `Dear Mr. Logan, If you have a secure shelter, do not quit it, for your life is in danger. For my sake do not venture to town again, as no disguise will protect you.— Have you repented—will you become a protestant? I think of you momently.— My father has told me to-day, that I must positively marry the burgomaster, on pain of his displeasure. Oh, that you were a protestant! The happy, yet unhappy, Bertha.' `Noble, true and good,' exclaimed Logan. `And you saw her; and spoke with her. How I envy you.' `To be sure I did,' answered Steiney, composedly. `In the meanwhile, Bayard and his adherents reached Albany, and raised the standard of rebellion, against Leisler's government. Bayard, proclaimed himself governor, under William &amp; Mary, and appointed his council, and performed all other acts of power. He seized the fort there, and declared that he held it, and the province, for the King and Queen of Great Britain, and that he would not maintain any connection with Leisler. Thus was the Province in the hands of two protestant parties, each party professing allegiance to the same sovereign, and denouncing each other as rebels. Upon hearing of Bayard's acts at Albany, Leisler sent a messenger to him, demanding the surrender of the fort.— The messenger was imprisoned for a day, and then sent back with a similar demand, to Leisler. Each party, now strengthened itself by every means in its power. The Roman catholic party, in the meanwhile, remained quiet, feeling that its authority and influence were passed; and that they would be compelled to yield allegiance to the protestant crown. The chief difficulties, now therefore, were between the two protestant factions, Leisler's, however, grew the strongest; and the second week after the establishment of his government, a ship arrived from England, bringing despatches addressed to `the Governor, or such person as for the time being, administers the affairs of the Province.' The messenger who brought them, after hearing a statement of affairs, delivered the packets to Leisler, who opened it and read it, as if directed to himself. From this moment, he assumed the title and state of Governor, with confidence. Colonel Bayard, hearing of the arrival of the ship, came, secretly, to New York, to see the messenger, and lay before him a statement that should criminate Leisler, hoping he would lay it before the King. But, the presence of the opposition leader, being made known to Leisler, he arrested him on a charge of rebellion, and cast him into prison. The convention, at Albany, hearing of the arrest of their chief, dissolved their government and fled for safety, some to the colony of Massachusetts, others into New Jersey. There was no longer, therefore, an organized opposition to Leisler's authority. While Leisler was establishing himself upon a height of power, from which he was soon destined to fall, Logan was by no means inactive, in carrying on a minor conspiracy, against his authority. For nearly two weeks, while all these important affairs were proceeding, involving the interests of so many, he was privately corresponding with Bertha, by means of Steiney, who went, nearly every day, to the town with fish, of which Bertha, became suddenly, as both her father and the burgomaster thought, extravagantly fond. The tenor of his notes to her, were earnest entreaties for her to consent to be his, fly from her hateful union with Van Vow, elude her father, and meet him at the house of the priest, where they would be united; and thence proceed to England. Her letters to him, were earnest entreaties for him to become a protestant, without which she could not think of him, save as a friend. At length, the morning of the day arrived, which was set for her to be married to the burgomaster. Although in a note he had received the evening before, she had said she would not consent to be his, yet he feared that she might be prevailed upon to yield; for she had said that her father was firm, though she had implored him with tears, not to sacrifice her. `Now, Steiney,' said Logan as the other prepared to start to town, early in the morning of the fatal day, `I wish you to return by noon; for I shall probably go up with you. Here is money; I want you to purchase a fish woman's dress, throughout, cap, bonnet, clogs and all, and bring them back with you. If I go to the city, I shall go as your mother, or aunt.' Steney grinned with delight, and said he knew where he could get precisely such a costume as he wanted. He then hoisted his little sail, for the wind was fair, and steered for the town. `She shall not marry him this night, if I have to risk my life to rescue her,' said Logan, as he saw the boat blend with the distant shore of the town. `She loves me with all her heart; I will save her from a union with this man, though mine she may never be.' At noon Logan was at his post looking off towards the town. His keen eyes soon detected the little brown sail of the piroge, and in less than half an hour the boat was at his feet. `Have you seen her, Steiny?' `Yah, master Logan; here is a note, and in this bundle I have got your woman's dress.' Logan hurriedly tore open the soiled note, Steiny was not a rose-scented lady's page, and it smelled villainously of fish; though the words were fragrant with sweetest perfumes of affection. `Dearest Logan, I know not what or how to address you. In a word, if you would have me, you must come and take me! It is in vain for me so resist my father and Van Vow conjointly. I must fly from the fort, or before eight o'clock to-night be the wife of this hateful simpleton. I have no escape unless I take poison or fly to you. I think nothing of your being a Roman, for I know when I am your wife you will isten to me. I think only of my love for you! of avoiding this horrible fate that awaits me. My father is stern and unbending. Van Vow is resolute. I have thrown myself upon the mercy of the former in vain; I have entreated the latter to spare me. I have told him I love him not, that I cannot love him. He is without feeling. He has finally, within the last half-hour said if I will pay him back the thousand dollars he will release me. I am mortified to allude to this, since you have not done so. But what can I do? I am in his power. If you can send the money to me do so at once and let me return it to him; for if he should inform my father I shall have to confess all, and I know not what will be my fate. You see I write with frankness to you as one in whom I trust my heart and happiness, for I believe you truthful and noble, and that you love me even as I love you. This is a crisis when it would be weak and foolish in me to disguise any thing I feel; and I have not done so. Send the money, if you can, or let me hear from you. Bertha.' `Money! What can the dear, sweet child mean?' he exclaimed. `What does she say about money?' inquired Steiny with a guilty look, overhearing the words. `Do you know any thing about this? What can she mean?' `What does she say, chappy?' `That she has obtained a thousand dollars for me and she seems to think I have got it. It is all a mystery.' `It is very mysterious!' `I don't know what to make of it.— You must go at once and try and see her again and tell her I have not the money, but I will come myself as soon as it is dark. Unless she has this money she must marry Van Vow of whom she borrowed it. But what it was for I cant tell —I know nothing about it. If I had a thousand dollars at hand I would send it to her. But I have not the half of it with me.' `Must she Marry Van Vow if she dont get this money?' `So it seems.' `Then I'm bless'd if —' Here Steiny interrupted himself and looked very resolute. Logan went into his but and tried on his disguise. He then made his appearance before Steiny who threw himself on the beach and rolled over and over with laughter at the strapping figure he cut. `No body'd ever guess you was any body else than my grandmam!' he cried out with delight. `Now what are you going to do?' `As soon as it is dark go over to the city and do my best to save Bertha from her fate. If it were not for this mysterious money she talks about there would be no fears, for Van Vow would give her up; and we could then get off to-morrow. But it must be done before eight, or all is lost. Go at once back and tell her I will meet her at the ever-green oak outside the fort, if she can escape. Tell her that it is impossible for me to get the money she wishes to-night, and she must trust to flight alone for escape.' Steiny, after getting into his boat and under sail, turned in shore to a wooded rock and disappeared for about ten minutes, when Logan saw him re-appear, lugging something into the boat, when he immediately set sail again. Bertha was in her room sad and thoughtful when she saw Steiny reappear crossing the yard of the fort; for he had become so well known he was, like many others, let in and out at will during daylight; but at dark the gates were all closed and strictly guarded; though now that Bayard was in its prison there was comparative quiet in the town. She saw the boy's fish basket seemed to be very heavy and her heart bounded, for she believed he brought the means to pay the burgomaster. `Nice fish, ma'm,' said the boy in a loud tone. `Here's nice gold fish too,' he added significantly. `Has he sent it?' `Yah, just as you gave it to me. To tell you the truth, ma'm, he didn't never know we axed a thousand dollars to let him off. That was a cheat to get the gold out o' you. He never knew of it. He thought it was only by your influence over us, you see. He dont know I got a dollar, or he'd a blowed me! So when he read your note and I found I'd got you into a scrape, I jist goes and digs up the bag I'd hid and brings it off to you.— Here it is, ma'm, just as it was, and I'm d—d sorry I flamgusted yer to get it. Jist take it and give it to fat cheeks and let him go cry!' With these words he placed the bag on the floor of the gallery. `You are a noble and honest youth. Mr. Logan shall know this, if I ever am so happy as to see him again, and you shall be rewarded more than this. You have done me a greater service than you suppose by bringing it. Shall I see him?' she asked eagerly. `Yah. He says he'll be from seven to eight o'clock at the oak out by the wall. He says you must try and baulk Mynheer and your dad, and meet him.' `Happy news! Tell him I will be there.' `Then hadn't you better keep the thousand?' `No; it must be returned to him. It will solace him. Besides, he shall have no word to say against Bertha Leisler's fair name!' At a few minutes before eight o'clock the same evening, a lad and a tall person habited as a fisher's wife, were standing beneath an oak that grew near the wall, when a young man, wrapped in a cloak, came hurriedly towards them. Logan, half guessing who it might be, bounded forward with Steiny. `Bertha!' he said softly. `Robert!' was the rapid answer. `I should not have known you but for Steiny! We have no time to lose! I shall be missed in five minutes! Let us fly!' As they went swiftly along, she told him that all was ready for the bridal, and she had seemed so quietly to consent that they left her alone. Many guests had come, and she let them continue to assemble; and even the burgomaster she had seen go into the room where he was to wait for her; for Van Vow, though he had his money again, had now no power to act as he had pledged to, for her father insisted that the nuptials should take place. Thus had Steiny lost his `bag of rocks' without benefit to Bertha, though very much to the honer of his own generous nature; and we trust every candid reader will give him credit for the deed, as much as if Bertha had been benefitted by it. `I waited till the last moment,' continued Bertha to the happy and listening Logan, `when I suddenly quitted my room, entered the hall, and catching up a cap and cloak, upon which I had previously fixed my eyes, I hastened from the door, leaving my dressing-maid to believe that I had only stepped into the library. Thus I got safely from the house; and, having the countersign, I was suffered to pass out of the gate by the sentry without question, he doubtless taking me for one of the guests who had been invited to the wedding. I hurried away from the gate and at length discovered you. Now I am happy.' `And I perfectly, dearest Bertha,' responded Logan as he hastened on towards the residence of father Stephen.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. THE BRIDAL SCENE IN THE GARRISON. When the guests were all assembled in the large drawing-room of the Governor's house, within the Castle, the latter dressed as became a Governor at the bridal of his only daughter, entered, accompanied by the Lutheran minister in his black cassock and round skull-cap. Mr. Leisler bowed to his friends and other guests, about twenty in number, who had been invited to the ceremony. In one corner sat the burgomaster's little mother, in a starched ruff and gay cap, and seemingly very proud and happy at the prospect of being related, by the marriage of her son, to the family of the chief ruler of the province. The Governor, after bowing around to the guests, advanced towards her, when she rose up, and, smiling, made him a low, formal courtesy. `Where is your son and mine, fair vrow?' he asked, with looks of satisfaction. `The hour is within three minutes of the time when the nuptials are to take place.' `He is in te next room, waiting to pe called, your excellencies,' responded the good vrow. `Pless you,sir, he seems very much afraid; but it is naturals, for one isn't married every days.' `I will go and take him to my daughter's room, so that together they can enter the parlor, as is seemly they should. This must be a happy day to you, dame.' `It is, your excellencies, fery happies,' responded the good lady, courtseying to the floor as the Governor turned from her to speak to the minister. `Reverend sir, I believe it is now time for the couple to come in. Are you ready to perform the ceremony?' `I am all prepared to do my duty, your excellency,' answered the clergyman, in a strong nasal tone. The Governor then passed out into the apartment on the left of the mantel-piece. It was a sort of ante-room to the parlor. In it, for the last ten minutes, Mynheer Van Vow had been alternately perspiring with fear and chilling with apprehension. It seemed well for him, as his good mother had remarked to the Governor, that people were not married every day. He was plainly very much excited for a gentleman of his phlegm.— He was full dressed in a fawn-colored broad-skirted coat, faced with white satin, scarlet breeches, and blue clocked hose that showed to advantage his shapely calf; he had a lawn ruffle in his bosom of amplest breadth, and upon his wrists were displayed cuffs of embroidered lace. His hair was brushed carefully back into a short pig-tail, that stuck straight over on his collar, and was garnished with white ribbons in a true-love's knot, tied by his careful and prideful mother. His head was white with powder. In his hands he carried a pair of dove-colored kid gloves, and upon the first joint of the little finger of his left hand was a very small plain gold ring, the circle with which he purposed to bind the fair Bertha to his side for the present life. The finger being very small which the ring was intended for, and the fingers of the burgomaster being shaped like blue-nose potatoes, it was really a wonder how he managed to get it even upon the first joint of his lesser finger. `Well, Mynheer Van Vow, I see you are ready for the ceremony,' he said, surveying his buckish appearance. `The hour is at hand.' `I am fery glat, for I am losin my courages fast, Governors. It melts avay off mine fingers. Vhere is Berthas?' `She is also doubtless ready in her apartment, and only waiting for me to conduct you to her. Give me thine arm.' `Good Governors,' said the burgomaster, hesitating and feeling that he was about to sacrifice a lovely maiden who loved him not, `I would mush rathers disweddings didn't pe.' `What! do you at this hour renew your objections. Tell me fairly, what is your reason for not wishing this union?' demanded the Governor sternly. `I knows Berthas doesn't loves me. I knows, if I marries her, she'll be misrable as ever vas.' `And it is only on this account?' `Yes, none oder; for I loves her mit all mine souls and podies.' `Then you shall wed her. I am not to yield my purpose up to an idle whim on her part. I have questioned her about this repugnance to you; but she gives me no satisfactory reply. I shall not now heed-her weak objections to a union upon which I have set my heart. Do not offend me by any more resistance. These times that have come upon us are rife with danger to us all, and especially to me. I am surrounded with enemies. My life may yet be sacrificed. Bertha, at such a crisis, needs a protector. You are a suitable one, and I know will love and honor her. When she is married to you, one great source of anxiety will be removed from my mind, and I shall be freer to give myself to the weighty duties of my station. Follow me. Mynheer, and let there be no further obstacle to my wishes. I need not remind you that while she remains unwedded she is exposed to danger from the machinations of this adventurer, Logan. Come, let the nuptials be performed at once.' Thus speaking, the Governor walked to a door at the side of the ante-room, passed through a narrow entry, and then stopping before a closed door at its extremity, knocked upon it, saying, `Come, Bertha, the guests wait. I have led hither thy husband betrothed. Come out and go with him to the drawing-room. It is now the full hour set for the nuptials.' There was no reply. The Governor listened for a moment and then opened the door just as it was opened from within by Bertha's Dutch dressing maid. `Where is thy mistress?' asked the Governor, looking around the chamber. `She went into your book-room to speak wit you, she said,' responded the woman. `In the library? I have not seen her. Perhaps she waits me there.' Thus speaking, he passed through an inner door, and entered a room used as a library and office. There was no light in it; and, after calling upon his daughter's name, he sent back the burgomaster for one of the candles that stood upon the toilet table. The room was now surveyed, and a glance showed him that his daughter was not there. `How long since did she leave her room to say she was coming in here?' he asked the dressing-maid. `About five or six minutes. She told me to stay here and wait for her.' `I have not seen her, answered the Governor with the first emotions of suspicion. `Perhaps she has gone into the drawing-room. Come with me, Mynheer. Doubtless she waits you there.' Encouraging his fears with this hope, he hastened back into the drawing-room. `Has my daughter been in here?' he demanded, turning pale, as his eye did not encounter her form in the room. `She has not yet made her appearance, your excellency,' answered the minister. `Yet I am ready to perform the ceremony of marrying her to the worthy burgomaster.' Van Vow, I begin to mistrust evil,' said the Governor. `Go and search every part of the house each of you here. My daughter has disappeared. He who finds her shall have a hundred marks.' Her father hastened from room to room till satisfied that she had flown, when he flew to the sentry at the gate. `Has my daughter passed out? `No, your excellency.' `Has any one?' `A young man.' `How long ago?' `About ten minutes, your excellency.' `How was he habited?' `In a cap and cloak.' `Did you see his face?' `No, your excellency,' responded the soldier; he kept his cap down, and besides it was dark, as you see, in the passage way. He gave the countersign as I let him forth.' `It must have been she! repeated the Governor, in amazement. `She has fled disguised! But I will soon learn!' He hastened back to the house, which was all in confusion. The house had been thoroughly searched, and no discovery had been made of the missing maiden. `Look you, my friends, and see who misses a cloak and cap!' `I do, your excellency,' answered a young Dutch gentleman, pressing forward. `Then I am dishonored and made ashamed before you all by my own child. She has flown from the fort, disguising herself in the cap and cloak. Ho, guards! to your arms!' he shouted. `Disperse yourselves through the streets! Search every nook about the fortress! Hasten! She has ten minutes the start, but she may yet be taken! He who brings her back to me shall be paid two hundred marks of silver! But heed ye, soldiers; lay not a hand roughly upon the child, for remember she is still, though a fugitive, the Governor's daughter!' `Dish ish a fery astonishing pusiness!' gasped the burgomaster as soon as he could fairly realise that Bertha had flown. `I do wouders vhere she can pe goings?' I fear that this Logan has something to do in this!' responded the Governor, pacing up and down in front of the gate of the fortress, in great perturbation.— `You seem to take her departure with sufficient philosophy, Mynheer Von Vow,' he cried angrily, seeing the burgomaster's visage. `I would rathers she runs afay from me now tan afder the marriages,' answered the Dutch lover with calmness. Indeed, in his heart, the burgomaster did not feel sorry at her departure. He felt that if she would fly to avoid a marriage with him she would never have made him a happy husband; and so long as he had got his thousand dollars back again he was disposed to regard this turn in the affair as advantageous than otherwise.— Not so her father. His bosom was torn with mingled grief, alarm and anger. At one time he would pour upon her head the bitterest invectives; at another, call upon her name with thrilling tenderness. In vain his friends tried to console him. He would not be comforted. One after the other the soldiers whom he had dispatched in search of the fugitive returned from the pursuit, reporting their want of success. The affection of the father now began to take the ascendancy of paternal resentment, and he began to fear lest she might have been driven by her antipathy to the burgomaster to throw herself into the water. He was about to hasten to the beach in the rear of the fortress to have search made for her, when the sentry handed him a note, which he said a lad had placed in his hand and immediately ran away. It was from Bertha, without date or place, but assuring him of her safety. The lovers reached the gate of the garden in which stood the priest's residence, without having met with any obstacle.— To the challenges of the sentries, which they encountered, they had the countersign, which carried them safely from street to street, until they had passed the lines. `Now, dearest Bertha, we are in safety,' cried Logan, as he heard the foot-step of the priest approaching towards the gate. `Who seeks admittance?' demanded the voice of Father Stephen from within the garden. `It is Logan, revered father!' responded the young man in an under tone.— `Hasten to open to us, for I bring with me a priceless treasure.' The priest slowly opened the gate, but seeing the disguises, half-closed it with quick caution. `Nay, it is I, though in a strange garb, good father,' answered Logan. `I know thy voice, son. Come in,' answered the priest, opening the gate to admit them. `But who have you with you?' `You shall know presently,' was the reply of the young man as he drew Bertha, trembling with mingled fear and gladness, into the garden walk. Steiny followed closely, while father Stephen relocked the gate and followed his guests towards his house. Logan conducted Bertha into the sitting-room, and breathing into her ears a few words of encouragement, threw aside his disguise and went into the hall where father Stephen stood. `Reverend father, I need your holy services in a matter dear to my heart.— The maiden with me is Bertha Leisler!' `What, the daughter of the heretic Governor?' `Do not take fire too quickly, dear father Stephen! She is my betrothed wife. She has fled this night from a hated uniou with the burgomaster Van Vow to become my bride. But you knew that I loved her. Will you unite us at once in the chapel?' `Has she acknowledged our holy religion?' `Not yet, but I am in hopes I shall be able to bring her over to the true faith, by and by. But let not this prevent your complying with my desire.' `It shall not, Master Logan, though I would rather she had embraced the true faith. But before you take this step, let me suggest to you, that by having the new Governor's daughter in your power, you can—' `Can what?' demanded the young man with a flashing eye, as if he half anticipated his proposition. `Hold her as a hostage for her father's good behavior. Nay, you can compel him to resign his usurped power, menacing his daughter with death.' `Do you think me an assassain! Do you judge me to be thus base? Some vile spirit hath put these words into your mouth, reverend father, for surely they came not from youa heart. Bertha Leisler is dearer to me than life; she is to become my honored and beloved wife.' `Forgive me, my son; I did but speak with policy for thy own interests. Take the maiden by the hand and follow me into the church.' With these words, the priest passed across the hall into the long room, in which we have already seen the conspirators assembled. He advanced to the altar, at its eastern extremity and lighted four wax tapers that stood upon it, two on either side of a small silver crucifix, of exquisite workmanship, executed by Benvenu'o Cellini, as the signature upon the pedestal bore witness. The apartment was about twenty-four feet long, by fifteen broad, was hung with black cloth, upon which all around the walls were suspended pictures of the various passions of the redeemer. Small as it was it had a solemn religious air; and the faint light of the tapers, almost obscured by the black hue of the walls increased this effect. Father Stephen now opened a small closet on the left of the altar, from which he took forth his snow white surplice.— He put it on, took a missal in his hand, and, placing himself by the right of the altar awaited the bridal pair. `Do not fear, sweet Bertha,' said Logan as she shrunk back upon the threshold of the chapel, awed by its gloomy solem nity, the tapers, the priest in his white robes, and the deep silence that reigned. `I do not fear, Robert,' she answered firmly, and entering with him at the same time, into the chapel. `Kneel children,' said father Stephen, in a grave voice, as they approached the altar, by which he stood awaiting them. In silence, together, they knelt before him hand clasped in hand. The priest then opened the missal, and proceeded in the most impressive manner to perform the ceremony of marriage. The sacred rites which were to bind two loving congenial hearts forever in one, were at length finished. When father Stephen had pronounced the blessing upon their union, both Bertha and Logan responded a heartfelt `Amen.' The happy bridegroom then raised his joyful, trembling bride, and calling her by the endearing, protecting appellation of `wife,' than which, no word is sweeter to a woman's ear, folded her to his trustful heart. Their happiness at this moment, who can depict? It could only be measured by the obstacles which had been so perseveringly encountered to attain it. Bertha now began to think of her father's anxiety, on account of her sudden disappearance, and to sympathise with his distress. Knowing that she was safe, she easily prevailed upon Logan to consent that Steiney should be sent to the fortress with a note, merely informing him of her safety. We have seen that Steiney faithfully executed the mission entrusted to him. The note read as follows:— My dear Father, Forgive the step I have taken.— I could NOT become the wife of Mynheer Van Vow.—I write to assure you of my safety. Your still affectionate Bertha. From Philadelphia, whither the happy pair, accompanied by Steiny, the next day fled, Logan addressed a letter to the father of his young bride, enclosing one also from her, explaining fully all that had transpired. In a few days afterwards they set sail for London. The following year Logan came to his inheritance and title as Earl of Rochfort; and never was a fairer Countess of that name and rank than the young and lovely Countess Bertha. But it was not long after her elevation to a coronet that she was called to mourn the lamentable destiny of her misguided father. Bayard's messenger had first got the King's ear, and Leisler was pronounced by the crown `a Rebel.' Thereupon he resisted the new royal Governor that was sent over, and fortified himself in the citadel. But at length he was compelled to surrender; was tried as a rebel, convicted and shortly after executed, a victim, as is well known, to party malignity; for his judges were his most bitter political and religious opponents. `The first,' says the historian of the period, `to raise the standard of William and Mary in America, he was the first to suffer as a traitor. He had appealed to the King, but in vain, for mitigation of the sentence of his provincial judges.' But the appeal which had been denied him during life was prosecuted after his death by Logan before the throne. It was successful. An Act of Parliament, vainly resisted by the Judge who condemned him to die, did justice to his memory by reversing the attainder. In conclusion, it is our painful duty to add that the burgomaster, as he had shared the fortunes of his friend Jacob Leisler, so in death he was united with him. He was executed with him, to the last declaring his innocence of any bloodthirsty intentions. His fortune, by will he desired to be left to Bertha; thus to the last manifesting towards her the most faithful and touching attachment. We record this fact in order that the last impressions of the reader concerning the persevering lover may be tinged with that respect which is due to his memory.— Steiny, patronised by Logan, became a flourishing sea-captain when he grew up, and in the wars with Spain, twenty-six years after his departure from the Province, commanded a Pink of ten guns, with which he did such good service that a brig was given him. He was finally killed in a battle with a Turkish frigate, at the moment the frigate struck her colours to his own. A newspaper of this day, alluding to the battle and his fall, styles him, `Captain Stein Sneek, a gallant officer, a skilful seamen, and an honest man, who made our national flag respected wherever he displayed it, whether it were before friend or foe.'
