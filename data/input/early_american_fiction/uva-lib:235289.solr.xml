      <field name="fulltext">CROMWELL. BOOK II. CONTINUED. A 2 CHAPTER VI. “Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son, It should be thus with him—he must die to-morrow.” Measure for Measure. “The outmost crowd have heard a sound Like horse's hoof on harden'd ground. Nearer it came, and yet more near, The very headsmen paused to hear.” Scott's Rokeby. It was already past the middle of the night which followed the tremendous conflict upon Marston Moor, yet many a light was glancing through the casements of the adjoining village, in which the cavalry of the victorious army had taken up its quarters. Strange and discordant noises echoed among the low-browed cottages—the stamp and scream of vicious chargers, the clash of arms, the din of the artillery wagons groaning and creaking over the ill-made roads, the moans and outcries of the wounded wretches, waked to fresh agonies by the rough motion of the carts which bore them from the field, watering the dust beneath their wheels with human gore—and yet, though every house and shed was occupied by the rude soldiery, there mingled not one tone of riot or debauchery with the accustomed sounds that indicate the presence of an armed multitude. All grave and stern the sentinels stalked their appointed rounds, or, if they broke the silence of their watch, it was but by the humming of some pious canticle; while ever and anon the louder accents of some military preacher rose upon the ear, or the deep chorus of a distant hymn. No wassailings prevailed about the watchfires—no songs of profane triumph were bellowed from the hostelries wherein the men were billeted—no yells of savage laughter nor female shrieks broke forth to tell of warlike license; in short, the aspect of the hamlet was rather that of some immense conventicle of armed enthusiasts, than of the nightly quarter of a triumphant host fresh from the shock, the rapture, and the glory of the battle. Before one dwelling, of pretensions somewhat greater than its neighbours, having a little courtyard with a low stone wall before it, and a grotesquely sculptured porch of native sandstone, there sat two mounted privates of the ironsides, one on each side the gate, so still and motionless that, but for the occasional tossing of their chargers' heads or whisk of their long tails, they might have passed for lifeless statues. The pale beams of the moon slept placidly upon their morions and breastplates, while the bright scarlet of their doublets was mellowed by the partial light into a dimmer and more sober hue. Within the court two more of the same sturdy corps walked to and fro, with ported carbines, crossing each other at brief intervals, the red sparks of their lighted matches showing their readiness for instant service. Within the house all were at rest save in one chamber, opening directly from the narrow hall or passage, whence might be heard, even without the walls, a heavy and irregular footstep clanging with military spurs upon the flagstones which composed the cottage floor, and now and then the suppressed murmur of a voice communing, as it seemed, with the deep thoughts of the speaker. It was a large, low-roofed, and stone-paved room, with heavy rafters, and a huge open chimney of black oak, dingy and mantled with the smoke of ages. A wide low window, divided into many lattices by massive free-stone mullions, with a long settle of carved wainscoting beneath it, occupied the whole of one side, while opposite to it, and at right angles to the hearth, another seat, of similar materials but superior workmanship, with a high panelled back and elbows, was disposed so as to shield the occupants from the keen blasts that found their way in winter through many a crevice of the time-shaken walls. Over this antique piece of furniture a scarlet dragoon cloak was flung at random, with a broad-brimmed and high-crowned hat of dark gray felt hooked on one of the knobs which decorated its extremities, while from the other hung a buff belt with a long iron-hilted tuck. Upon a table close before the hearth, on which a dozen fast-decaying brands silently smouldered, stood, with its wick tall and unsnuffed, a solitary lamp, casting a feeble and uncertain light about the room, which served, however, to display a brace of horseman's heavy pistols, an open map, a telescope, a worn and greasy Bible, and a leader's truncheon lying beside it on the board, as well as a confused assemblage of steel armour piled in a large armed chair, and glancing with obscure reflections from the shadow of a distant corner. It was, however, the inmate of the chamber that lent its chief attraction to the scene—a strong-built and stern-featured man, clad in a military suit of buff, such as was then worn under the corslet and thigh-pieces of the cavalry; his cumbersome jackboots were still about his legs, garnished with spurs as when he left the saddle, though all his other armour had been doffed in consequence of recent wounds, as it would seem from many a speck and splash of dingy crimson on the leathern cassock, and from his left arm bound up by a silken sling. It was the leader of the ironsides. There was a wild, unnatural expression on his grim features as he passed and repassed the light, and a strange glare in his deep-set eye almost like that of the insane. He muttered, at times, in audible and articulate sounds, but mostly in a half-uttered, inward key, striding the while with heavy but uneven steps, now fast, now slow, across the echoing floor; his hands were now crossed firmly on his breast, now tossed aloft as if they brandished the war-weapon, and now they griped each other with so stern a pressure that the blood started from beneath his nails. It might be that the fever of his wounds had terminated for the moment on his brain; it might be that a darker fit than common of his fanatic hypochondriasm had occupied his mind; but on this night the wise and crafty conqueror of Rupert resembled rather the mysterious energumenos, the possessed, fiend-tortured maniac of holy writ, than the cool, self-controlling, scientific leader he had that day approved himself. “King?—king?” at last he exclaimed, audibly, pausing from his uneasy walk, with an expression of uncertainty and even terror distinctly marked in every feature; “didst thou say king? No, no! not king! Avaunt, Baalzebul! Get thee behind me, Sathanas! It said not `king!' that solemn and tremendous shape, that drew the curtains of my boyish couch at the unhallowed hour of mid night—`The greatest one in England, but not king!'[1] [1] It is notorious that a story was in existence among the contemporaries of Cromwell, long before his attainment even of high military rank, to the effect that he had been awakened from his sleep, when a boy, by a mysterious shape, which told him he should be the greatest man in England, not, however, using the word king. Ho! have I foiled thee there? Ha—ha! well art thou called the prince of liars—get thee behind me! tempt me no more! Away, foul slave! By the Lord's help, I spit at and defy thee!” He took two or three turns across the room more quickly than before, and, again pausing, cried, “A trick of fantasy? Who saith it was unreal—have we not ears to hear and eyes to see? and shall we not believe what we do hear and see? Did not a spirit pass before the face of Job, that the hair of his flesh stood up? Stood it not still, yet he could not discern the form thereof? Was there not silence, and he heard a voice? And came it not to pass so likewise unto me, and much more also? Again—Did not the evil-minded Saul call up, through her at Endor, the living spirit of the departed prophet, that it did prophecy to him? And yet again—Did not the Roman Brutus, idolater although he was and heathen, hold converse with the shadow of his kingly victim, that was his evil genius at Philippi? And may not I—I, that was written down before the world began—I, that have been predestinate of old to execute the wrath of the Most Highest, and press the wine-press of his vengeance—may not I, too, commune with disimbodied ministers that walk in the night-season? Go to! go to! I heard its mighty accents as I started from my slumber, and they yet tingle in my fleshly ears—`Arouse thee, thou that shalt be first in England!' But not—it said not—king!” Again he took a short and hurried turn through the apartment—“And if it had,” he cried, in higher tones—“and if it had said king! Be there not lying spirits—be there not tempters—be there not false prophets? Had it said king, then had I roused myself indeed! Then had I striven with the Evil One that he had fled me! for to the putting down, not to the raising up of tyrants was I called— not that to me men should bow down the knee, and wallow in the dust, and cry `Hail, monarch!' but that, throughout this goodly realm of England, there should be innocence, and righteousness, and peace, and liberty, and truth for ever!” He paused again in his soliloquy, and, as he paused, the challenge of a distant sentinel rang sharp and clear through the still night—the clatter of a horse's hoofs—another challenge—and another—a bustle in the courtyard, and the sound of several feet hurrying toward the door. With the first faint alarm the general was himself again; he passed his hand across his eyes, and drew a deep sigh, as if to ease his breast; then, turning to the table hastily, he trimmed the waning lamp, and, seating himself, instantly resumed the studies whence he had probably been hurried by the ferment of his distempered spirits. The outer door was opened, and several persons, after a moment's parley with the sentinel on duty, entered the house. A heavy hand rapped quickly on the door, followed by a blunt voice—“The captain of the watch to speak with General Cromwell.” “Enter the captain of the watch,” cried Oliver; and as the well-known face of an approved and trusty comrade met his eye—“What now, good Kingsland,” he exclaimed; “how goes it with the host?” “All thanks be to the Giver of all mercies, well!” replied the officer; “but here is one without—yea, even one from the stronghold of the malignants—seeking to parley with you.” “One from the town of York—ha?” answered Cromwell, with the speed of thought; “admit him speedily—” “Nay, not from York,” returned, the other, “nor is it any he. Of verity it is a damsel, yea, and a damsel decked with the comeliness—truly, I say, with the loveliness of the flesh!” “Tush! tell not me of comeliness!” cried Oliver, very sharply; “of God's truth, Ahaziah Kingsland, thou art a fool thus to disturb my meditations for a most frail and painted potsherd—a Delilah. I warrant me—a Rechab—yea, and a painted Jezabel—a harlot from the camp of the Egyptians. Cast her forth straightway! leave me, I say—begone!” “It is not so,” replied the other, sturdily—“it is not so, an you will hear me out. It is maiden of repute; she rode up to our outpost on the western road with three stout serving-men, seeking the captain of the night, and, verily, when I was brought to her, she claimed to speak with General Cromwell touching the young man Edgar Ardenne—” “Whom, of a truth, my spirit loveth. Admit her, and that, too, without tarrying; and bid them fetch in fuel, for lo! the fire hath burnt low while I did watch and pray, and the night air is chill, though it be summer—and lights and wine, I say, and creature comforts, such as may fit the tender and the delicate of women!” The words were yet upon the lips of Cromwell when a tall female figure, marked by that indescribable yet not to be mistaken air of grace which is seen rarely but in persons conscious of the possession of high station and pre-eminent endowments, was ushered into the dim-lighted chamber. The coarse, dark-coloured riding-cloak, wrapped closely round her form, could not entirely conceal the elegant proportions which it was evidently intended to disguise; and still less could the wide-leafed hat of country straw, tied closely down upon the cheeks by a silk kerchief, mask the aristocratic mould of the fair features, or hide the rich luxuriance of the light-brown hair, which hung, uncurled and damp with the night-dews, far down upon her shoulders. A slight bustle occurred while the general, with his attendant officers, tendered her in dumb show the courlesies demanded by her apparent rank, and yet more by her isolated and defenceless situation; but, with an air of quiet dignity, she waved off their civilities, and expressed, more by her manner than her words, a wish to be left alone with the far-dreaded leader of the Independents. Meanwhile more logs had been heaped on the hearth, and now threw up a flickering and lively glow, which, added to the lustre of some three or four fresh lights, diffused itself into the farthest angles of the room. The serving-men and his subordinates withdrew, Oliver sternly ordering them to hold themselves aloof, and pray to be delivered from the sin of eavesdropping. Then, without any affectation, or display of fear or of embarrassment, the lady dropped her mantle, and stood forth revealed in all the bright and beautiful proportions of Sibyl Ardenne. Her face was pale as death, yet it was firm and perfectly composed; there was no flutter of her pulse, no tremour of her frame, no doubt or hesitation in the clear cold glance of her expressive eye—all was calm, self-confiding, resolute, and fearless. “I have come hither,” she said, without waiting to be first addressed, in a voice slow and passionless, yet exquisitely musical, “I have come hither, Vol. II.—B General Cromwell, in a fashion men will deem unmaidenly, and women bold unto effrontery. I have come hither under the shade of night, alone, save with the company of menials, unto the foeman of my family, my king, my country! yet dare not, even in your most inward soul, to deem me light or frail. I have come, I say, hither, casting aside all prejudice, all fear, and all reserve— detying the opinion of the world—incurring the contempt, the hatred, and, perhaps, the curse of those I hold most dear. Yet have I come, upheld by mine own conscience, and firm in the resolve to hinder a foul crime. All other means have failed—tears, arguments, entreaties! All—all! I say, save this. Get you, then, instantly,” she went on, rising as she spoke into strong energy, “to horse! To horse! to horse! if you would save your friend, your fellow-soldier, your preserver— alas! that he was such—if you would save Edgar Ardenne! He is a captive to the cavaliers, sentenced to die at daybreak.” “To die!” vehemently interrupted Cromwell— “to die! they dare not—no, for their souls they dare not! Did they but harm one hair of him, I would hang fifty of their best and noblest higher than ever Haman swung in the free airs of heaven!” “Sentenced,” she continued, quietly, and without heeding the interruption, “to die to-morrow! Yet he may still be rescued if you will it so. Prisoner to a small body of the retreating cavaliers, he will be shot at daybreak if not released this night; nor can he be released save by your strict obedience to my bidding! Obey me, and to-night you rescue him who would have died to save you! Despise my warning, and to-morrow you may, perchance—avenge him.” With a fixed, scrutinizing glance, the general gazed upon her features while she spoke as though he would peruse her soul. “And who,” he said, at length, “and who are you that speak thus resolutely, act thus boldly, in behalf of him who is the foeman of your tribe—even the stout and valiant Ardenne?” “It matters not,” she answered, steadily, “it matters not who I may be, or what. It matters only that you subscribe to my conditions, and get you straight to horse.” “Thus far it matters only,” answered Cromwell, “that, an I know you not, yea, and, moreover, know your motives likewise, I stir not, horse nor man! There be enow of dames and damoiselles among you who would deem falsehood very righteous truth, if so ye might entrap one who—although himself he saith it—hath been and will be a keen instrument, yea, a two-edged sword, to work destruction on the sons of Belial!” “Not so, not so!” she broke upon his speech with striking energy, “not so, by all my hopes of Heaven! Such may be thy creed, to do ill that good may come of it; but I—I would not stoop to falsehood were it to buy the lives of thousands such as thou art. My aim, my only aim, is to preserve the young from a most cruel and heart-rending doom—to save the aged from a most deadly crime. I am—know it, and use the knowledge as you list —I am the niece of your friend's sire.” “Ha! Mistress Sibyl Ardenne—is it so?” muttered the general, musingly. “The brother's daughter of that perverse and bloody-minded old malignant, whose right hand is crimson—crimson with the persecution of the saints! Verily this is a sure and trusty witness! And so you would preserve the youth—a valiant youth he is, and I do say it—stout of heart, strong of hand, tender of conscience—yea, a burning and a shining light to men. And so thou wouldst preserve him, and wouldst wed with him—ha! is it not so?—and win him to the faction of the man Charles Stuart! —preserve his life so to destroy his soul! Is it not so? Ha! have I read your heart?” “You have not,” she answered, with calm dignity, “you have not read it; nor can you so much as conjecture or imagine the motives or the thoughts of such as I, more than you can comprehend the sacred truths which you misquote, perverting them to your own ruin. Know, General Cromwell, that, not to be the empress of the universe—not to restore my sovereign to his lawful throne—my country to its ancient peace, would I espouse the man who, whether from misapprehended duty or from wilful wrong, can band himself with persons like to thee—lending himself a willing tool to be played off by rebels to their monarch—traitors to their country, and—alas! that I should live to say it— vile hypocrites before their God! It is for this— for this that I would have him live, that he may not lack season for repentance; and that his miserable father may be spared the sin of slaying his own son!” “His father!” shouted Cromwell, excited now beyond all self-restraint, “his father! In God's name, speak out, maiden! His father! Merciful Lord! what meanest thou?” “He is a captive to Sir Henry Ardenne,” she replied; “made captive in the very action of defending him, and doomed by him to perish, as a rebel and a traitor, with the first break of dawn!” “Where lie these cavaliers? What be their numbers? Speak!” “Promise me, then,” she said, with infinite composure, “promise me, as you are a gentleman, a soldier, and a Christian, that, save to rescue Edgar Ardenne, you will not turn the tidings I shall give you to your own gain or to King Charles's detriment. Promise before the Lord, and by your hopes of an hereafter, that you will shed no drop of blood which is not absolutely needful to his safety; and more, that, he once safe, you will strike no blow farther, but return straightway to this spot, molesting no man, nor taking any note of their position or proceedings against whom I shall lead you, for twelve hours' space.” “Tush—tush! it may not be. Say quickly where they lie, and what their numbers, so shall we save your lover; but dally not, I pray you, lest we may be too late to rescue.” “Promise!” she answered, steadily. “Dally not, maiden—I say dally not,” Cromwell repeated, very sternly, “else shall the blood of him thou lovest, and not this only, but the guilt of that insane old homicide rest on your head, who mightst have saved them, but wouldst not.” “Promise, or not a word from me. Promise, or I go hence, and Heaven befriend whom thou desertest to destruction.” “It may not be, I say—it may not be!” he cried, gnashing his teeth, and stamping violently on the floor, in a fierce paroxysm of unbridled rage. “Speak quickly, girl, and truly, or instantly I cast thee into bonds. Without there, ho! a guard and fetters!” “Promise, or you may tear me limb from limb —ay, draw me with wild horses, yet shalt thou nothing learn. Promise, and I tell all.” The guard rushed in—grim, gloomy-looking fanatics, to whom their leader's merest nod was law —yet she was silent as the grave; and the dark zealot paused in deep perplexity. His brow was B 2 stormy as a winter's midnight; his eye cold, hard, and pitiless; his teeth compressed so firmly that his very lips were white as ashes; and his hands clinched, yet quivering with emotion. While he yet doubted, a slow solemn sound came floating down the night wind to his excited ears; it was the village clock striking the second hour past midnight. “Three hours more,” she said, in a low, mournful voice, “three hours more, and nothing will remain of him you call your friend except a little blood-stained clay, which you may—or may not— avenge!” The muscles of the general's mouth worked violently, his clinched hand gradually opened, the expression of his eye grew softer. “Noble heart—noble heart!” he muttered; “well hath the prophet spoken, `a virtuous woman is beyond the price of rubies.”' Then, raising his voice, he said, distinctly and aloud, “Before the Lord, my Judge and my Redeemer, and by my hopes of grace, I promise thee. It shall be done as thou wouldst have it. How many, and where lie they?” “Three hundred horse—in the small town of Wetherby on Wharfe.” “Sound trumpets—boot and saddle! Mine own first ironsides to horse; let them all carry petronels. Despatch! despatch! Saddle me Thunder for the field; I will myself to horse! Find me three trusty guides, that know each yard of country for ten miles around! For life! for life! no tarrying!” Forth rushed the subalterns; the trumpets flourished, piercingly shrill and stirring; then came the clash of arms, the trampling of quick feet, the glare of torches, the din of confused voices, the pawing and the snort of chargers, and all the thrilling sounds and sights of an alarum at the dead of night. “One more word, maiden,” he exclaimed, while fastening the rivets of his corslet with an impatient hand; “where hold they him in ward?” “In the courthouse,” she answered, “hard by the market-place, and nigh the river-bank. And now forget you have beheld me—forget it, and farewell!” “Nay—nay,” he said, “not so. You go not hence save with our escort. Too much risk have you run to-night already.” “No,” she replied, “I must be home before you. I lodge not in the town, and I may well be missed. I must be home before you, else will all fail.” “Nay, thou art right in all things,” Cromwell answered, “and as thou willest it shall be. Kingsland, conduct the maiden in all honour to her own attendants. Lady,” he added, taking her by the hand, with a benevolent expression lighting his gloomy features, “lady, thou art a goodly and a glorious creature, and this night hast thou done a deed worthy the noblest of earth's daughters. A soldier's blessing, although he be not of thy faith nor of thy faction, cannot disgrace or harm thee. The God of Israel bless thee, then, and guide thy feet aright, and give thee peace, and happiness, and understanding. Farewell, and doubt not that I will deal with thee righteously; for if I fail thee to transgress my promise, may He whom I profess to serve—with frailty, it is true, and fainting, yet with sincere heart-zeal—do unto me so likewise at mine utmost need, and much more also!” He let fall her hand as suddenly as he had taken it, and, as if half ashamed of the emotion he had shown, abruptly turned away and scanned the map which lay upon the table with intense scrutiny; while Sibyl, wondering at the singular emotion and unexpected conduct of the hated Independent, silently left the house, to hurry homeward with an easier heart than she had carried to the quarters of the Puritans. Before half an hour had elapsed, five hundred chosen horsemen were under arms and in the saddle—the very flower of Cromwell's finest cavalry —and he himself, despite his wounds, his arm yet hanging in a sling, mounted and at their head. After a short and hurried conversation with the guides, he gave the word to march, and led them at a rapid trot along the moonlight roads, none knowing, save himself, the object or direction of their route. When they had ridden some six miles upon their way, he halted suddenly; “Is there not hereabout,” he said, looking toward the guide, who rode beside his rein, “a path whereby to reach the Wharfe, and ford it here, some mile or so below the town?” “A half mile farther,” answered the countryman, “a lane turns off to the left down to the Flint-mill ford, two miles below the bridge.” “Ho! Captain Goodenough,” cried Oliver, “take thou this fellow to the rear, and, as we pass the lane, turn down it with the last troop; tarry not on thy way, but cross the river, and keep the right bank up until thou be within two gunshots of the bridge; there halt till that thou hear my trumpets, and then charge! over the bridge—into the town—and strike straight for the market-place! If that ye be discovered ere ye hear me, delay not, but dash straightway in. If that your guide deceive you, shoot him upon the instant. Be cautious and be quick—away!” On they went, quickening still their pace, and, as they passed the lane, the troop appointed to the duty wheeled off, steadily, but without slackening its pace, and hurried on its route. Another mile was passed, and once again the general halted; “Kingsland and Pearson,” he cried, “move to the front; I would hold counsel with ye; and bring the other guides;” then, as his officers arrived, “there be,” he said, “two other roads, besides this which we follow, that enter Wetherby this side the river — the great North road from Boroughbridge, and one from Knaresborough yet farther to the west. Goodenough holds the bridge, and I will keep this route. You two must ride across the country till that ye reach these roads. Feel your way down them, each one as nearly as he may unto their outposts; and, when ye hear my trumpets, charge, as I said before, and cut your way straight for the market-place. Kill no more than ye must, and make no prisoners. Keep your men well together, and be steady. Send back your guides to me, each with an orderly, when ye have reached the roads. Ye have but a scant hour to do it, but that is time enow an ye employ it diligently. By then the moon will set, and we shall have it dark and misty. Be wary, and success is certain. God speed ye, gentlemen. Away!” And off they rode across the open fields, which stretched, at that time, without fences or enclosures, except a few small drains, for many miles over that fertile district. An hour passed slowly over, and the moon sank, as Cromwell had predicted, into a heavy bed of clouds, yet he moved not. His men were drawn up, all dismounted—but each trooper by his horse—in a small piece of marshy woodland, open to the road, where they could not have been discovered by a chance passenger. The morning grew not lighter yet, for a small drizzling rain began to fall, with a dense fog, rendering objects scarcely visible at ten feet distant. Another half hour passed, and yet no tidings. “Mount, ho! and blow your matches,” exclaimed Cromwell, breaking the silence, which had so long remained uninterrupted by any human sound or whisper. “We must fall on, else shall we be too late—trusting to fortune and the favour of the Lord that our friends be at their posts. Wheel to the left, ho! Forward—trot!” and he put his horse at once into his swiftest pace. Just as he moved his men the clang of hoofs came rattling up the stony road; it was the guide from Pearson, with an orderly. “All's well,” he cried; “stout Captain Pearson hath gained the farther road; Kingsland must needs be at his post; and lo! here comes his messenger.” “Forward, then! forward!” shouted Cromwell, “for lo! there breaks the morning. Forward, and when the outposts challenge us, sound trumpets and shout cheerily!” And on they went, clattering at a furious pace along the broken roads; and now they almost reached the town, the lights of which they might see feebly twinkling through the mistwreaths. An awful sound broke on their ears, heard fearfully distinct above the din of hoofs and clash of spur and scabbard—it was the first note of the death-bell! “Gallop! ho! gallop!” Cromwell shrieked out, in piercing tones, that thrilled to every heart, plunging his spurs up to the rowel-heads into his charger's side; but his command reached other ears than those of his stout followers. “Stand, ho!” challenged a drowsy sentinel, whom they had wellnigh passed unnoticed, despite the clatter of their march; “stand, or I shoot!” and, at the selfsame point of time, his musket was discharged; but its report was drowned by the heart-thrilling flourish of the trumpets and the repeated warery of the charging zealots. On every side the trumpets of the general were answered by the simultaneous shouts of the three bands he had detached, by the quick clatter of their horses' hoofs, and the sharp ringing volleys of their carbines. On every side the outposts were cut down, and the town entered sword in hand. The death-bell ceased to toll—the ringers had deserted it in terror. The bugles pealed, and the drums beat to arms, but it was all too late. The few who were on foot were instantly cut down; others came rushing from their quarters half attired, with lighted torches and unbelted brands, only to gaze in mute and unresisting terror on the complete success of the assailants—only to see four gallant troops of horse, wheeling from opposite directions and in resistless numbers into the market-place!—to hear the clang of axe and hammer upon the prison-gates, mixed with the deafening huzzas of the triumphant Puritans!—to mark, by the red glare of many a flambeau suddenly kindled by the troopers, their captive borne in triumph from the cell—which he had never dreamed of quitting but for the place of execution—mounted upon a ready charger, and girt round by a ring of swords that set the very hope of rescue at defiance! One short note of the bugle, and every torch expired as suddenly as it had been illumed. Another, and the strangers fell into column with the speed of thought, and, filing off at a hard trot, were out of sight so rapidly, that, but for the dismantled gates, the empty dungeon, the decaying brands that smouldered on the ground, and the few scattered bodies outstretched upon the miry pavement never to rise again, all that had passed might have been almost deemed a wild and baseless dream. CHAPTER VII. “Perseverance, dear my lord, Keeps honour bright—to have done is to hang Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail In monumental mockery. Troilus and Cressida. The terrible campaign of '44 had ended; not, indeed, with that total overthrow of Charles and absolute dispersion of his party which might well have been looked for after the complete route of the finest army he had ever been enabled to collect upon Long Marston Moor, and which would probably have followed had all the generals of the commonwealth been equals—in spirit, energy, and firm devotion to their cause—of the true victors on that bloody day, Fairfax and Cromwell. But, in truth, during the years which had elapsed since the uplifting of the royal standard, the aspect of affairs in England had been changed greatly for the worse, and men's opinions had undergone, if possible, a greater alteration. Each party, as is the natural consequence of opposition, whether in argument or armed strife, had but become more desperately wedded to its own principles or prejudices. The king, though he had gained no single step toward a general result of conquest or pacification, was more resolved than ever to come to no terms, save such as he could never reasonably even hope to gain, with his rebellious subjects. The people, meanwhile, were becoming weary of the war, and all the miseries that follow in its train; and seeing that there was no hope that Charles would ever listen either to prudence or to reason until reduced to infinite extremities, were daily, hourly increasing in their animosity to him, and in their readiness to urge on and promote, by every method in their power, the interest of his enemies. The nobles, on the other hand, those even who had been the first and the most zealous to proclaim themselves adherents to the parliament and constitution —the first to buckle on the arms of legalized and just rebellion—perceived at length that, through the self-destructive obstinacy of the king, the civil strife could have no end save in the downfall of the monarchy, and consequent suppression of all aristocratic privilege. They relaxed then their efforts —fought, if they fought at all, with feeble and uncertain spirit, as doubtful whether conquest or defeat to them would prove the greater evil; and would, had they possessed the absolute control, have suffered the war to go out, as it were, for very lack of aliment. Among the royalists, immediately upon the issue of that bloody field, the gallant Newcastle, justly incensed at Rupert's furious and unmannered rashness, by which, indeed, the whole North had been set at stake and lost in one pitched battle, had thrown aside his arms, and crossed the seas to gratify, if it might be, in happier realms, his taste for those accomplishments and arts of peace which were far more congenial to his improved and courtly intellect than the rude din of camps and foughten fields. The prince, without so much as an attempt to rally his dispersed and shattered forces, fled with all speed toward Chester, while York, relieved in vain, surrendered in a few days to the conquerors of Marston. Better success, however, than could have been expected, fell to the cavaliers in other portions of the realm. Charles, who, a few days previous to the defeat of his rash Vol. II.—C nephew, had worsted Waller at Cropredy bridge, now following up his slight advantage by a vigorous and able movement into Cornwall, pressed upon Essex with such skill and perseverance, that the general of the parliament was forced to make a most precipitate escape by sea. Hopeless of bringing off his army, he went on board with a few officers, having first sent away his horse, under command of Balfour, to cut their way as best they might to London—an end which, owing to the shameful revelry of Goring, who suffered them, although forewarned even of the hour when the sortie would be made, to pass his lines unchallenged, he most successfully accomplished—and leaving all his infantry, artillery, and baggage, under Skippon, to take the best terms of surrender they might gain from the king's policy or mercy. A second desperate drawn battle followed before Newbury, wherein, as they had done in every action, Cromwell's undaunted squadrons carried all before them in that part of the field where they engaged; although at other points the headlong valour of the cavaliers retrieved the day, and gained the doubtful credit of a balanced fight, owing, as it was said, to Manchester's uncertain if not dishonest policy in absolutely prohibiting the leader of the ironsides from making one more charge on the retiring royalists, when, as that officer asserted, a complete victory must have undoubtedly been won by such a movement. After this fruitless struggle, relieving the beleaguered posts of Donnington and Basing House, the king once more took up his quarters for the winter in the loyal town of Oxford, with better hopes than he had entertained since the complete subversion of his party in the North; on news of which his queen had instantly escaped to France, and he himself had deemed it wise to send the Prince of Wales to Bristol with a separate council and an independent army, judging it hazardous to hold so great a stake as their united safety embarked upon a single venture. Toward the dead of winter, the armies being both laid up, the puritanic leaders returned to Westminster, to take once more their part in the proceedings of the houses, since they had no more opportunity of active service in the field. Matters in parliament looked wildly — parties ran higher now than they had done at any time, even before the royalists seceded from the councils of the nation—the Presbyterians and the Independents striving with rancorous and bitter energy to gain the upper hand. Commissioners were indeed sent from both sides to treat for peace, as during the preceding winter, at Uxbridge, but rather to preserve appearances than from the least belief on either hand that they could prove successful in their mission. Such was the state of things when, on a keen December's afternoon, Ardenne had strolled forth from his lodging under the pressure of uneasy thoughts, to try if exercise and change of scene might banish the dull sense of rooted sorrow, almost amounting to despair, which had possessed his bosom. At first he wandered aimlessly about the streets, until at length he found himself in the long alleys of St James's Mall, the stage in former days of so much gayety and pomp, but now all gloomy and deserted by every living thing except a few disconsolate and dingy sparrows, huddled together on the leafless branches of the elms, or twittering feebly in the wintry sunshine. The dull and lonely scenery—the grassplots mantled partially with crisp hoarfrost—the wide canals sheeted with rotten and half-melted ice—the rustic benches white with the slippery rime—the big drops plashing down from off the southern branches of the giant trees—and, above all, the utter solitude, the absence of any human being, harmonized so well with the dark and almost misanthropic mood which had crept on the young soldier, that he continued for above an hour to walk to and fro, almost unconscious of the flight of time. He was at length, however, awakened from his revery by the approach of three men walking at a rapid pace toward him, apparently engaged in conversation of the strongest interest. A single glance sufficed to let him recognise the persons of Ireton, Vane, and Cromwell. So deeply were these gentlemen engrossed in their discourse, that it was not till they were on the very point of meeting that Cromwell knew his favourite officer. They did not even then, however, pause; but, with a courteous salutation, passed him, still speaking rapidly in a low tone. After a few steps Oliver quitted his companions, and, turning short round, followed Edgar at so swift a pace that he overtook him almost instantly. “You are well met,” he said, entering without preamble on his subject; “had I not thus—by special favour, it should seem, of Providence—encountered you, I should have sought you in your lodging ere to-morrow morning. There is a great change working—yea! a great change in Israel! And truly it is needed; for, verily, the tares have multiplied among the harvest of the Lord—they have increased fourfold—they have grown up all green, and rank, and flourishing, that they shall overtop the goodly wheat, and choke it down, and triumph over it. But lo! the time is now at hand. The Lord hath borne it in upon our hearts, that we shall purge the field—that we shall purify the threshing-floor, setting apart the good grain from the sinful weeds—that so we may not die, but live!” “Of what change speak you, general?” returned Ardenne, somewhat coldly; “for, to say truth, I may not comprehend you while you speak thus in parables.” “May not or will not—whether?” Oliver inquired, with a solemn sneer curling his lip; and he fixed his piercing eye upon the face of Ardenne so sternly and so searchingly withal, that few men could have brooked his gaze without confusion; then, seeing that the countenance of Edgar, though firm and fixed, was frank and open as the day, he deigned to speak directly to the point. “Why, see you not,” he said, “that an these generals, these lords continue—self-seekers as they be, not holding their eyes steady and their hearts aright toward the public weal, but turning to the right hand and the left, struggling ever for their own advancement, backsliding, wavering, and fainting at the push of need—see you not that this war shall vex the realm long years, and that the man Charles Stuart must in the end prevail? For, lo you! even now these covenanting, crafty Scots, whom may the Lord confound, are hankering, as the Israelites of old, after the fleshpots of the heathen. I tell you, of a verity, if they might cast the net of their deceptions over this groaning land—even the foul abomination of an established Presbyterian church, sterner than prelacy, yea, more intolerant than papistry itself—they would desert us straightway, and unsheath the sword, edgeless although it be, and wielded by most weak and coward hands, to raise the king unto his former place, and stablish him in all the might, as he is steady in the will, to work upon our heads his ancient tyranny.” “Something of this I have perceived,” Ardenne C 2 replied, “and Ioath am I to own it even to mine inmost thoughts. But, on my conscience, I believe that Manchester and Essex wish not to see the parliament prevail too fully. Nay, more, I grievously suspect the Scottish leaders, and have done so from the beginning. It may be that I wrong them, but I do hold that their only object from the first hath been to force the bigoted and iron discipline of their presbytery upon this kingdom, intolerant, inquisitorial, meddling, vexatious, and fanatical. Nor do I think that they would strike one blow for liberty, save in this rooted hope.” “You do not, Edgar Ardenne, you do not wrong them,” exclaimed Cromwell, joyously. “I do rejoice that you have read them rightly. And would not you do somewhat—somewhat to free our necks from this most bitter yoke of spiritual bondage— to cast this burden from our consciences—would you not venture somewhat?” “Much, much!” cried Ardenne; “I would both do and venture deeply, an I could see the method and the time.” “Verily, I will show thee,” answered the other; “to-morrow do we hold a solemn fast and a soul-searching self-inquiry to the Lord in all our congregations, and all our preachers shall exhort us— truly the Lord hath put one leaven and the same into the hearts of all, and with it shall we all be leavened—showing us how unjust and scandalous a thing it is that we, the members of the houses, should engross all offices, both of the army and the state; giving a cause to backbiters and to malignants that they should scoff and cry, `Ha—ha! lovers of gain rather than lovers of the Lord! self-seekers, striving for the soft and elevated places! belly-gods hungering and thirsting for the fat things and the sweet things of the land!' Then shall we move before the commons, Sir Harry Vane and I, a self-denying ordinance, whereby no member shall hold, any more, any commission in the armies of the land. So shall these stiff-necked nobles be forced to yield the sway they have so misemployed, and Fairfax, honest and trusty Fairfax, shall take the place of doubting Essex.” For a moment Ardenne pondered deeply, and it was now his turn to strive to read the countenance of his companion, but all was dark, mysterious, and inscrutable. “Your scheme,” he said at length, “your scheme is naught, for by this ordinance you must yourself resign your truncheon; and, I care not although I say it, I hold you the main pillar of our armies in the field. Your scheme is therefore naught—nor could it pass the lords.” “The lords!” said Oliver, with a grim sneer; “trouble yourself not for the lords! Truly the time hath come when they must do even as the commons bid them. And for the rest, surely there is a way—” “An honest way?” asked Edgar, sharply, “for, to say truth, General Cromwell, I like not these by-paths of counsel; still less like I this calling upon holy names, this feigning inspiration and for ging miracles, this quoting and interpreting the word of God to justify things politic and worldly.” “Go to! go to!” cried Oliver, but with a dark and subtle smile; “thou talkest as a babe—yea, as a very suckling, that knoweth not the hearts of men. Know this—all things are honest that are wrought for honest ends. Moreover, many pious souls there be—yea, conscientious, tender, and God-fearing souls—that will not lend themselves to any work, how honest in itself soever, without they seek the Lord and learn his pleasure. I say there is a way, ay, and a righteous way, whereby we may retain our leading of the new-modelled host, and marshal it to glory.” “How so? I see it not,” said Edgar, wholly unconvinced by Cromwell's specious sophistry. “It must be most gross practice.” “Surely we may resign our sittings in the house,” answered Oliver, very slowly, watching the effect of every word upon the face of Ardenne, “if it be better for the people of the Lord that we continue with the army.” “And wherefore not they also?” “Wherefore not—” interrupted Cromwell— “wherefore, but because they, being peers of England, their seats hereditary, their privileges indefeasible—” “Well, sir,” Edgar broke in upon him before his speech was half concluded, “I see your plan, and I believe that you mean honestly; nevertheless, I like it not, and I will none of it. I love not devious counsels.” “And will you then fall off?” inquired the other, evidently much annoyed; “will you, that have performed such mighty deeds for the good cause, fighting the faithful fight for Israel, will you fall off to those whom you know wavering and fickle, if that they be not absolutely traitorous and false?” “I will do nothing, Master Cromwell, on that you may rely, I will do nothing,” Edgar replied, in quiet but stern tones, “that both my head and heart approve not. I may not in my conscience vote for this your measure; for though I quarrel not with the effects, but deem them most desirable, I do abhor the means. I may not vote against you, for I yet more dislike the course of your opponents. Neutral I will not be; therefore to-morrow I resign my seat. There be not any measures in debate in which I care to mingle. In matters of religion my voice is still for universal liberty; all systems of exclusion, whether they be Presbyterian or papistical, I hold alike despotic, bigoted, and Jesuitical, and I will vote for none of them. I will devote my parts where most they may avail—to the ordering of my soldiery.” “Be it so,” answered Cromwell, somewhat relieved; “be it so, since it may not be as I should deem for the better. But not the less shall we prevail in this thing, only hold thou my counsels secret.” “I am not wont,” said Ardenne, not a little ruffled, “to fetch and carry; and, as I said before, I do believe that you mean honestly; to-morrow, then, I shall resign my seat, and straight go down to the army.” “Farewell, then, till the springtide; and then, then, Edgar Ardenne, under command of the right gallant Fairfax, full early shalt thou see and own the wisdom of my measures. The next campaign —mark! mark, I say, my words, for they are of the Lord—the next campaign shall be the last for Charles.” CHAPTER VIII. “By Him who cannot lie, Each bright intelligence that studs the pole, Planet, or fixed, or wild eccentric star, With some weak mortal hath connexion strange Of good and ill. Yea, from his natal hour O'erlooks his fortune, culminating proud Foreshows his glory, but with watery hue Sanguine and dim prophetic points his wo.” Some months clapsed, as they had both surmised, ere Ardenne again fell into contact with his superior officer; and, in the interval, not one, but all of those great changes which the latter had predicted had indeed come to pass. After much fierce contention the self-denying ordinance, although opposed to the utmost by Hollis, Glin, and Stapleton, and all the leaders of the Presbyterian faction, passed both houses; Fairfax was named chief general of the parliament, and, by a series of intricate manœuvres, affairs were so arranged that Cromwell, still retaining his commission of lieutenant-general, was not required even to resign his seat in the commons. It was an evil omen for the royal party that Laud, after remaining in confinement during four whole years in the tower, was now brought to his trial, condemned, and put to death by ordinance of parliament, having in vain produced a regular and ample pardon, under the king's hand and seal. None, therefore, were surprised that, like all former efforts at a reconciliation, the treaty entered on at Uxbridge utterly failed in its results, the king on one side and the commissioners on the other exhibiting so much of haughtiness and unaccommodating spirit, that, unless by a miracle, no peace could have been possibly concluded. So much time had, however, elapsed in the debates at Westminster, and so late was it in the session ere the ordinance became a law, that the new model of the army was not accomplished till the spring was far advanced; and, ere the Independents were prepared to take the field, Charles had already gained some trivial but encouraging successes. The town of Leicester had been taken by assault, and miserably sacked by the wild cavaliers, who, as their means decreased, fell more and more into those desperate excesses which rendered, in the end, their very name a byword for debauchery and license; nor this important city only, but several other garrisons had been stormed sword in hand; while the new-modelled army had done nothing but suffered a repulse from Borstall House, and made a most unprofitable demonstration against the university of Oxford. Having received false tidings that Fairfax had sat down in form before that city, which might be deemed the capital of loyal principles, the king marched hastily with some eight thousand men, hoping to raise the siege, and force the general to a battle ere he should be joined by Cromwell with his cavalry; but hearing, after he had advanced as far as Daventry, that Fairfax was so near him as Northampton, he the same day retreated upon Harborough, intending to fall back on Leicester, where he might draw more infantry from Newark to his banner, and tarry the arrival of his northern re-enforcements. On the thirteenth of June the army of the parliament took up its quarters for the night about a mile to the south of the small town of Naseby, the ironsides, with Ardenne's regiment of horse, being a little in advance on the right wing of the position, and occupying a commanding station on a range of gentle eminences. It was a calm and lovely evening—so still and breathless that the smallest rural sounds—the lowing of the cattle from the rich pastures in the vale below—the bay of mastiffs from the scattered granges—the hooting of the owls from many an ivy-mantled pollard—even the breezelike murmur of the distant river—were clearly audible, in singular but pleasing contrast to the ruder sounds of the nocturnal camp. The moon, in unveiled gorgeousness, was hanging in a sky so perfectly transparent as is but rarely witnessed under the humid atmosphere of England, and millions of bright stars were flashing like diamond sparks in the unclouded firmament. Edgar had only joined that afternoon, and, taking orders from the general in person, had not as yet fallen in with Cromwell; but now, when he had seen his men duly provided with their rations, his horses picketed and well supplied with forage, and all precautions taken needful for a night to be passed under arms, be made his way along the lines toward Oliver's headquarters. Some two or three tents, rudely pitched about the centre of the ridge, with six or eight fieldpieces in battery before them, and the red cross on the blue field of the Covenant drooping around its staff, from which the gentle air had not the power to move it, readily showed him whither to direct his footsteps; but, somewhat to his wonder, on reaching Cromwell's tent, the sentinel on duty there informed him that the lieutenant-general had gone forth alone, beyond the outposts of the army, to wrestle with the Lord in prayer, even as holy Samuel went forth “to cry unto the Lord his God for Israel, that he might save them our of the hands of the Philistines.” Anxious, however, to see him before the morning, Edgar, inquiring of the sentinels and of the scattered groups of soldiers who were engaged cooking their evening meal about the watchfires, easily followed on his track, and at last, having proceeded some few hundred yards beyond the farthest outpost, discerned the figure of a man kneeling upon the open plain in the full moonlight, with both his arms outstretched toward heaven. The clear light glanced upon the polished iron of his morion and breastplate; and, even more than this, the harsh tones of the speaker, as he sent up in vehement profusion his wild supplications—or remonstrances, for such they were in fact—to the throne of grace, announced to him distinctly that he had found the object of his search. Before he reached him Oliver's prayer was ended; and, rising from his knees, he stood—his feet a little way apart, and planted with colossal strength upon the mossy sod—gazing with an air of calm enthusiasm upon the glistering heavens. “And thou, bright ruler of my destinies,” thus Ardenne, to his deep astonishment, heard him exclaim, “thou that didst smile upon my natal hour —thou that, through every change and chance of this my mortal course, hast given evident and never-failing tokens both of my weal and wo—thou that, when through long years I wallowed unregenerate and foul in the abyss of low and soul-debasing sin, wen dim and clouded ever with thick darkness—thou that, in after days, when, by the gracious mercy of that long-suffering and beneficent Lord—who willeth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live—my soul was touched of grace, and mine understanding enlightened to the sinfulness of my ways, wert seen to shoot forth scintillations pure as the seven living lamps that burn before the throne, which are the seven spirits of Vol. II.—D God—thou that, before the bloodred field of Marston, whereon the Lord vouchsafed unto the humblest of his servants to fight the great fight and to win the crown—even the crown of victory, conjoined with sanguine Mars didst shine pre-eminent —beam on! beam on, with that serene and placid gorgeousness, which fills my soul with the high confidence of coming triumph! Ha! who goes there?” he shouted, in a sharp, harsh key, strangely at variance with the wild enthusiastic accents of his previous meditations. “Stand, ho! and give the word!” “The sword of Levi!” answered Edgar, promptly; “lieutenant-general, I greet you on the eve of battle!” “Ha! Colonel Ardenne, by the voice,” cried Oliver; “right glad am I now to encounter you. I heard of your arrival, and truly I rejoiced that we should once more ride together into the strife of men. Surely the gentle beauty of the night hath tempted me to wander forth and commune here alone with mine own spirit. I do profess it is a most fair scene; saw you the stars at any time shine forth more gloriously?” “It is indeed a night of most unusual beauty for this our English climate,” Ardenne replied, somewhat surprised at the uncommon turn the conversation had thus taken. “I have seen many such, however, in Italy and Spain. But I knew not that you were so deep an admirer of nature—methought that men had rather been the subjects of your observation.” “It is not that, it is not that,” said Cromwell, “although all His creations must needs be worth man's study. But have you no belief in the connexion of those brilliant and mysterious twinklers with the career of men — the course of great events?” “In truth not I,” answered the other; “nor do I see how such belief can be consistent with the Christian's faith in a supreme and all-commanding Providence.” “But I do,” Cromwell interrupted him; “I see not wherefore the Eternal may not divulge a portion of our fates by means of these, the most sublime of his creations; nor wherefore the appointed angel, who ministers to every one of mortals unto righteousness, may not be likewise the presiding spirit over some one of yonder glorious worlds. I do believe it fully—yea, I have proved it. Lo! see you not you large clear star, there to the east of Lucifer, and higher toward the pole, brighter than all the planets? It shone upon my birth, and from my boyhood upward have I known and marked the face of that far sparkler, and ever has it varied with the varying of my fortunes—dim and most melancholy in my benighted days of evil, but glorious, as you see it now, when aught of greatness or of glory was in prospect. See how it shoots forth jets of most pure light. No other star doth likewise. Verily, verily, the Lord shall work great things for us to-morrow!” “I have heard tell of this before,” Ardenne replied—“of this your superstition, for so I cannot but consider it; and likewise, that you fancy how you saw a vision years ago.” “Fancy! fancy I saw a vision,” cried Oliver, impatiently. “I tell you, Edgar Ardenne, as plainly as mine eyes behold you now, I saw that dusky form—as clearly as mine ears drink in your doubting accents, so clearly did I feel the tones of its immortal voice. How should I fancy such things? I was then but a boy—a wayward, headstrong, and most ill-conditioned schoolboy. It was a Sabbath night, and I lay wide awake, plotting I know not what of orchard-breaking or of henroost-robbing for the morrow, when suddenly a strange and thrilling fear crept over me. I knew that I was not alone, though I saw nothing. I felt as though a pair of mighty wings were spread above me, chilling my very soul. I would have cried aloud, but my voice choked within me. I would have risen up and fled, but could not move a finger; and yet, although I say it, I was then bolder than my years betokened, and feared not man or devil. It was a night of murky darkness, but suddenly a faint and pallid light filled the whole chamber, not emanating from one brighter point, but uniform as daylight, though very dull and ghastly; my curtains were drawn suddenly asunder, and a tall misty shape stood in the opening. I tell you I did see it perfectly and plainly, for I did not faint, though my flesh quivered aguelike, and the cold sweat stood in beads upon my brow, and my hair bristled, as instinct with life. There stood it while I could have reckoned twenty, and then a deep slow voice, of strange and solemn harmony, rolled forth without an effort—`Arise! arise,' it said, `thou that shalt be the first in England!' It vanished, and all again was darkness, but the voice was tingling in mine ears when the next sun was high in heaven.” “And do you credit this?” asked Ardenne, fixing his eyes with something of suspicion on the face of the enthusiast. “Do you trust in this prophecy? Does this dream actuate your waking movements?” “And wherefore not?” said Cromwell; “the elder Brutus, he who made Rome free, was called the First in Rome, and Father of his Country. A man may be the first, and yet not king nor tyrant. Cannot you credit this?” “I fear me,” Edgar answered, very gravely, “that this vision was a spirit—the evil spirit of ambition! Beware, I say, beware how you give heed to it! Truly there is not much about me of the antique Roman; but did I think—as half I doubt even now — that this same vision were but the working of an unholy thirst for power, which may one day induce thee to lay violent hands upon thy country's freedom, I have yet so much of the Cassius in me that I would thrust this sword, which I have buckled on to fight thy battles, into thy very heart, ere thou shouldst live to find thy vision truth!” “We! wo is me, what have I said?” cried Oliver, apparently much moved; “alack! alack! truly the flesh is weak, but strong and sincere is the soul. Well hast thou said, my friend, and rightly wouldst thou do, should I be rendered subject to the temptings of the Evil One. Wo! wo is me, that I should be mistrusted; surely, if this heart be not honest, then there is neither faith nor honesty in man. But thou, Lord, knowest—thou beholdest —yea, thou searchest the most inward thoughts of this thy servant. Continue me, then, oh thou merciful and mighty one, continue me thine instrument, and shield me from the power of the Evil One; and be thy word a lantern to my feet; and keep me, even as I now am, thine, oh Lord, thy servant, and thine only!” and with the words he burst into a violent passion of tears, mingled with sobs so choking and hysterical that Edgar was alarmed, half for the intellect, half for the health of the strange being in whom he felt so deep an interest. Within five minutes, however, the ecstasy had passed away, and, as if he had forgotten D 2 all that had just occurred between them, Cromwell addressed him now in the decided although quiet accents of command. “Soh! Colonel Ardenne, you will join your men forthwith. Go over once again your roll-call. See all be in right state for carly action. One hour hence report to me your numbers at my tent.” And with a slight but courteous inclination, he turned his back, and walked away toward a watchfire round which some dozen of the ironsides were grouped. Food was before them—ammunition-bread, steaks of beef rudely cooked upon the embers, and a black-jack or leathern tankard of strong ale, while several pipes of Trinidado were sending forth their powerful fumes above the savoury odour of the viands. “Ho! Hezekiah Sin-despise,” said Cromwell, addressing a grim-looking trooper—for he knew every one of his men personally and by name, “how fare ye here? Have the knave commissaries dealt with ye righteously? Surely ye must not fast, else shalt the flesh be weak upon the morrow.” “Yea! general,” returned the independent, “'tis very righteous truth. Wilt not thou taste thyself, so shalt thou judge how fares the sturdy but rough-coated private, on whom doth fall the brunt and burden of the service?” “Take, eat!” exclaimed another of the soldiers, tendering to him a wooden platter heaped with beef and bread. “Eat, drink with us to-night, as we shall fight with thee upon the morrow.” “Will I not?” answered Cromwell, seating himself beside the speaker, and helping himself heartily to the plain but wholesome food. When he had finished eating he filled a cup of ale, and, nodding to the troopers, quaffed it until he nearly saw the bottom; then, with a hoarse laugh, “'Twere evil manners did I not share with thee, Born-again Rumford,” he exclaimed, “since thou didst share so courteously with me;” and, instantly suiting the action to the word, he chucked the rinsings of the cup full into the broad face and grizzly mustaches of the man who had supplied him with the meat. “Thou hast it there—thou hast it fairly, Born-again,” shouted the soldiers, much delighted by the practical jest of their stout leader. “I know not truly,” Oliver continued, with a grim smile, “whether indeed this Rumford hath been born again, either in flesh or spirit; but this I do know of a surety, that he is now Baptized-again—hey, Rumford? Hand me a pipe of Trinidado,” he continued, turning toward another of the military saints, who sat near grinning heart and soul at the rough witticism. “Think ye now, men, that freton—he is your commissary of the horse, I trow, and sees to these your rations— think ye that Ireton, and Desborough, and Rossiter fare any wise more daintily than ye?” “Ay, marry!” answered Rumford, somewhat sulkily, “the private and the officers be not alike in aught. Saw we not Master Zedekiah, Desborough's secretary, bear, not five minutes since, a right fine haunch of grease, and store of flagons of Bourdeaux into his master's tent. Lo! there go Rossiter, and Jepherson, and Fight-the-good-fight Egerton, to banquet even now upon the fat things of the earth!” “Ha! is it so?” cried Cromwell, his eye lighting up; “verily, then, the kid shall be preserved from out the spoiler's jaws, and given as a feast unto the shepherds! yea! even unto those who watch! See here, Baptized-again; I go hence straightway to my quarters. Enter thou in to Desborough's pavilion, and summon them all instantly to meet me at my tent in council. When ye shall hear three taps upon the kettledrum, then rush in, all of ye, and fall to bravely—spare not to spoil the haunch, nor yet to drain the flagons—I, even I myself, will stand between ye and the fierce wrath of your officers.” “Cromwell! Live Cromwell!” shouted the delighted soldiers; “now may the Lord preserve to us valiant and trusty Cromwell!” The object of their rude praises turned aside; but, ere he went, another rugged jest displayed yet farther the wild humour which at times possessed him; for, as he passed behind the back of the tall trooper whom he had addressed as Sin-despise, he took the pipe out of his mouth when he had kindled its contents by two or three quick puffs to a red heat, and struck the bowl so sharply on the rim of the man's corslet, that all the blazing ashes fell down his neck, between the shirt and skin. “Now may the Devil—” shouted the trooper, springing to his feet. “Ho! swearest thou? Fy! fy! for shame!” cried Oliver. “Orderly officer, set Hezekiah Sindespise down in thy book, five shillings for an oath. Truly, thou shalt no more be known as `Sin-despise,' but rather as `Overcome-by-Sin.” Again the soldiers roared their merry approbation, till Oliver, surveying with a mirthful aspect the contortions of the scalded veteran, and moved to some compassion by his rueful countenance, drew forth his purse, and, taking out the fine, handed it to the non-commissioned officer. “Our discipline must be preserved,” he said, “and the foul vice of swearing I do abhor—yea! utterly. But, in that some share of the fault was mine, who tempted the loud railing of this rash Rabshakeh, verily I will pay the sum in which he standeth mulcted. Tush! twist not thyself, man, to and fro, nor grin as though it hurt thee. Methought my ironsides were proof 'gainst fire as well as steel!” and, without farther words, he hastened to his tent, where he found Ardenne waiting with the list of his returns. “When all the council shall have entered in,” he whispered to the sentry at the door, “strike three taps on the kettledrum, and suffer none to come in or to go out after.” Scarce had he spoken ere the officers made their appearance, Desborough wearing a marked air of sullen discomposure, and all save Ireton, whose spirit was of a higher and a nobler mould, showing some symptoms of vexation. “Give you good evening, gentlemen; please you draw nigh to the table,” Oliver exclaimed, “and make me your reports—past doubt we shall engage to-morrow.” And for wellnigh an hour's space he kept them there engaged in various details of military service, some, truly, of importance, some trivial and almost unmeaning; when at length all was finished, “Soh! we have done at last,” he said; “have you supped, gentlemen? So far as goes a crust of bread and cheese, and a good cup of ale—campaigner's fare—I can supply you, if you will tarry here and eat with me.” “Thanks, worthy general,” said Rossiter; “but, in good sooth, we were just at the sitting down in Desborough's tent when that your summons reached us. He hath, I know not how, wrung forth a noble haunch of venison and store of Bourdeaux wine from some misproud malignant here at Naseby!” “Soh! soh! right creature-comforts—trust Desborough for that!” Cromwell replied; “why spoke ye not of this beforehand? my business might have tarried; but let me not detain you. Farewell until the morrow.” “Not so, fair sir,” Desborough answered, “please you to walk with us and share our supper.” “Nay, I have supped already,” he replied, “with some good fellows of Jepherson's stout regiment. Well, since you be so pressing, I will e'en walk down and crush one cup of wine with ye;” and, without farther words, they all proceeded, conversing gayly as they went, toward the tent of Desborough. They reached it, and how strange a scene was there—the canvass flapping on all sides open to the air—the lamps streaming and flaring in the night wind—the seats around the table occupied by a dozen or so of rough-looking cuirassiers, quaffing the rich wines, hacking the now dismantled viands with knife and dagger—laughing, whooping, and shouting in their joyous revelry —while a score, at the least, of others waited till these had finished, to fall in and take their turns. “Now shall you see,” said Ireton, who understood the scene at half a glance, “our stout host, Desborough, foam like a baited bull. This is, I warrant me, one of the general's jests—somewhat rude; yet do the soldiers prize him all the more for them.” “Damnation!” muttered Desborough, in violent though smothered fury, “but this doth pass a joke!” “Yea! 'tis a passing good one!” answered Oliver, with an attempt at wit which drew a laugh from the carousers; “but surely thou didst swear; a fine! a fine unto our treasury; look to it, Mr. Commissary! So, now, these excellent good fellows have watched with their lights burning, and their loins girded up, and they have their reward. Art thou an hungered, Desborough? Nay, then, our worthy Ireton will find you rations; less delicate, perchance, than yon fat haunch that was, but savouring more justly of the camp, and more proportionate to the hard messes of your fellow-soldiers in the Lord. Fy! fy! but this was gluttony; and the means, too, if I mistake not, won by extortion! But enough of this! Off with ye to your quarters, ye well-fed knaves, and snore off this carousal; and ye, fair gentlemen, though supperless, good rest to ye. Right bravely shall we breakfast on the morrow, an Rupert keep his purpose. The Lord save ye!” CHAPTER IX. “The night is past, and shines the sun As if that morn were a jocund one, Lightly and brightly breaks away The morning from her mantle gray, And the noon will look on a sultry day. Hark to the trump and the drum, And the mournful sound of the barbarous horn, And the flap of the banners that flit as they're borne, And the neigh of the steed, and the multitude's hum, And the clash, and the shout, `they come! they come!” Byron's Siege of Corinth. At an early hour of the following morning, while the east was yet gray with the lingering shadows of the night, the army of the independents drew out into line, and formed itself on ground of the most advantageous nature. This was a long range of low hillocks, dominating the whole plain or valley that separates the towns of Harborough and Naseby, the latter lying in the flat a little to the northwest of the parliament's position. Their centre, for the most part, was made up of musketeers and pikemen, with a good park of field artillery, and Fairfax's life-guard in the reserve, the whole commanded personally by that true gentleman and gallant soldier—the right wing was composed of Cromwell's ironsides, with Rossiter's and Ardenne's lighter regiments; while the left, consisting likewise all of horse, was under Ireton's direction. All their arrangements were completed ere the first flush of daylight broke through the leafy screens of woodland which fringed the eastern verge of that wide champaign; but soon the thin clouds that were scattered over the summer sky assumed a rosy tinge; a flood of golden light succeeded, and then the great disc of the sun himself rushed up in living splendour from the low horizon. The vapours gradually melted from the lowlands, and disclosed a beautiful expanse of rural scenery; deep velvet pastures studded with noble trees, green hedges rich in the flowery garniture of spring, masses of forest throwing their dark blue shadows in long checkered lines across the laughing meadows—all sparkling with the morning dewdrops—all clothed, as with a radiant mantle, in gay and gorgeous sunshine. The cattle lowed in the abundant valleys, the lark sprang upward from the pearly sod, the rooks sailed forth upon their matin voyage, their harsh voices pleasingly mellowed by the distance, the hares limped through the young wheat, scattering the dew from the thick herbage in lengthened mazes—but not one sound or sight was there betokening aught save happiness and peaceful quietude. The royal host, meanwhile, was also in array some six miles distant, on a height just south of Harborough, and posted yet more strongly than their enemies, could the mad impetuosity of those whom Heaven had marked out for destruction have tarried to avail itself of their advantage. But, as the day drew on, Rupert, who led the cavalry of the king's right—leaving the centre under Lord Astley, and the left commanded by the noble Langdale, still in position on the hills, with the life and horse guards in reserve—dashed forth, two thousand strong, to reconnoitre. About the same time Ardenne's regiment had been detached for a like purpose; but that wary partisan, feeling his way with caution through the wood-roads and defiles of the valley, easily detected the advance of the royalists, himself unperceived. Placing three troops in ambush, with instructions to check the prince's march by one deliberate volley, and then to fall back on the spur, he drew the rest off, and in a short half hour had the satisfaction of collecting his whole force under the guns of their position, Rupert having been fairly staggered by the fire of his skirmishers. Still, with his wonted obstinacy, that rash leader porsisted in believing that the Puritans were in retreat, and despatched message after message, to order first, and then to hurry the advance of the main army, which left its vantage ground and fatally descended into the open plain; so that, before three hours had elapsed, the generals of the parliament might see the whole of the king's host rushing like birds into the fowler's net. With admirable foresight, Fairfax resolved to suffer them to clear the broken country ere he should attack them; seeing that, if defeated, the enemy must be cut off among the lanes and passes, which would be choked with fugitives the instant that the battle should be turned into a rout. The ground immediately below the hill was open, as was the whole width of the slope, excepting two or three stout timber fences and a group or two of trees, which were at once pulled down or felled by Ireton's pioneers, leaving as fair a field for the encounter as ever was defaced and trampled into Vol. II.—E gery mire by the death shock of thousands. A little after ten on that bright summer morning, Rupert's bold cavaliers had cleared the woodlands; the heads of Astley's columns were seen slowly taking up their ground, and wheeling into line to form the centre, while Langdale with his northern horse was toiling at a full mile's distance in the rear to bring up their field-ordnance. Still no material opposition was offered to the royalists, except that now and then a solitary cannon belched forth its snow-white cloud, and hurled its shot with terrible precision into the crowded files as they debouched upon the plain. But now the trumpets of Sir Marmaduke were heard upon the left, and he appeared with all his Yorkshire chivalry; though still the cannon of the cavaliers were at the least a mile behind, encumbered by the fat loam of that fertile district. Still the impetuous Rupert paused not; the instant that the cavalry of Langdale came into view upon the left, his bugles sounded for the charge; and with a cheery shout, leading his fiery squadrons, himself the foremost man, he hurled himself against the horse of Ireton with the velocity and brightness of a thunderbolt. Forward they rushed—a torrent of plumes, scarfs, and rich embroidery—their brandished rapiers glittering aloft like lightning, and their high-blooded chargers tearing the turf to atoms in their furious speed. Such was the fury of their onset, that, neglecting to discharge their carbines, they plunged at once into the closest conflict. There was a clang as of ten thousand smiths plying their iron trade! a shout that was heard, as men say, at Harborough! And brave although they were, stubborn and resolute, the cavalry of Ireton wavered— in vain their high-souled leader strained every nerve and bled at every pore; new here, now there; rallying, shouting, charging; in vain he crossed swords with the fiery prince, and checked him for one moment—they bent, they broke, they fled; then flashed the pistol-shots, and in unbroken force over them swept the cavaliers! The ground was cumbered with the slain—but still, over the dead and dying, over the voiceless trumpet and the tattered banner, over the mute dismounted ordnance, amid the groans and blasphemies, the shivering clash of steel, the neigh of maddened chargers, and the wild shouts of his victorious troopers, on charged the daring leader! on! fetlock deep in gore! “Now, an he wheel upon our flank, the battle is half lost already,” bissed the deep tones of Cromwell in the very ear of Ardenne; “but lo! the Lord hath blinded him—the God of hosts hath robbed him of his understanding! See where he drives along, heedless of aught save massacre and havoc. Ho! by the light of heaven, this day shall crown the whole.” And, in good truth, neglecting all, wild as the whirlwind, that destroys and still sweeps on, hearing destruction it knows not and it recks not whither, Rupert pursued the flyers—mile after mile they fled—mile after mile he followed—beyond the heavy ordnance, beyond the baggage of the parliament, cheering until his throat was parched, and his voice clove to his jaws! slaying until his sword was blunted, and his arm weary and exhausted! Scarce five troops of the whole left wing had held their ground, and these under the valiant Ireton, as, fired by the success of their companions, Astley's stout infantry came steadily and firmly onward, charged gallantly upon a stand of pikes—they were hurled backward as from a castle wall; and still that deep array of pikes rolled onward. They rallied, and again they charged, driving their horses in upon the serried spears, and firing their pistols in the faces of the sturdy footmen. But the cavaliers received them as the bull receives the mastiff, and hurls him from his unseathed front—their leader was dismounted and made prisoner—their bravest were stabbed down and mangled by the goring pikes—they scattered and fled diverse. But now the musketry awoke, mixed with the louder bellowing of artillery; and, save the rolling smoke-wreaths which packed above the hosts in the calm hush of the hot noontide, and the red glare that ever and anon surged upward, and now the waving of a standard, and now the flash of wheeling weapons half seen among the volleying clouds, naught could be now descried. Yet still the royal foot pressed on, unbroken and invincible; and Fairfax, though his lines fought stubbornly and well, and formed again when shaken by the musket-buts and halberts of the royalists—who hardly fired a shot, still fighting hand to hand—and poured their volleys in deliberate yet fast, felt that he still was losing ground, and that the vantage of the hill alone preserved him. On the right of the parliament's array the conflict had been long delayed, for Langdale had scarce formed, even when Rupert's charge had pushed the horse of Ireton clear off the field; and Cromwell dared not flank the foot of Astley, lest he should be in turn outflanked by Langdale. But now, with kettledrum and trumpet, and shot of carbine and of pistol, Sir Marmaduke advanced upon the gallop; and Cromwell, tarrying not to receive his charge, swung forth his heavy squadrons, with a thundering hymn, to meet him. An officer rode forward from the Yorkshiremen, as both lines halted to reload, and Oliver dashed out in person to encounter him. Their pistols were discharged in vain, for Cromwell's bullet glanced from the corslet of the cavalier, and the other fired at random—then blade to blade they met; a dozen passes flashed with the speed of light between them; their horses wheeled and bounded obedient to the bit; Oliver missed a parry, and his morion with the chin-strap severed fell clanging to the ground; but, without hesitation, in he went, and hailed so thick a storm of blows upon his foeman, that he beat down his guard and hurled him headlong. The whole passed in an instant—ere another had elapsed the adverse lines were mingled; yet, as they closed, Born-again Rumford sprang to earth, caught up the general's morion, and tossed it to his saddle-bow. Hastily, as he galloped on, shouting his battle anthem, and still at every shout striking a cavalier down from his saddle, he threw the morion on, but with its peak behind, and so unwittingly fought on through all that deadly strife. Equal in numbers and well-matched in spirit, the tug of war was dubious and protracted between the Northern horse and the unconquered ironsides; but, in the end, Cromwell's enthusiastic energy prevailed, and Langdale, fighting to the last, was driven from the field. Then! then was the superior moral of Oliver's men proved past doubt. Obedient to the first word, they drew off, careless of plunder or pursuit, although their blood was stirred almost to phrensy by the protracted struggle and by the beat of their religious zeal. “Oh! Ardenne, on!” Oliver shouted, as he halted his own five regiments. “Pursue—pursue! suffer them not to rally—support him, Rossiter; away! Break them to pieces—scatter them! The Lord of hosts hath given them a prey into our hands! All glory to the name of our God!” And, as he spoke, he wheeled at once upon the E 2 flank and rear of Astley's infantry, which still maintained the conflict in the centre, slowly but steadily forcing their way against the stubborn valour of the puritans. One hope remained for Charles—one only! In the reserve himself, with his lifeguard, commanded by Lord Lindesay, and his own picked horseguards—his troupe dorée of nobles—under the Earl of Litchfield, and Rupert's best foot regiment, in all some thirteen hundred men, fresh and unwearied, who had not, on that day, unsheathed a sword or pulled a trigger, he had a fair occasion to draw out and fall upon the flank of Cromwell, as he swept round to charge the foot; and so, to do him but free justice, he proposed. Bidding his trumpets sound, and drawing his own rapier—sheathed as he was in glittering steel from crest to spur, conspicuous by his broad blue scarf and diamond George—he plunged his rowels into that snow-white charger, rendered immortal by the deathless pencil of Vandyck. His pale and melancholy features transiently lighted up by strong excitement, “Follow me,” he exclaimed, “follow me, all who love Charles Stuart.” Full of ecstatic valour, they sprang forth—another instant would have hurled them on the unexpecting and unguard—ed flank of Oliver, who was already hewing his way, crimson with blood from plume to saddle-bow, through the now reeling infantry. The charge must have been perilous to Cromwell in the extreme —might have destroyed him utterly; and, had it so fallen out, the victory was the king's, for Rupert's scattered troops were even now beginning to return, and Fairfax could scarce hold his own. But the charge was not made! Whether from folly, cowardice, or treason, it now can never be discovered, the Earl of Carnewarth, a mere cipher in that band of England's noblest peers, seized on the bridle of the king. “Saul o' my body,” he exclaimed, in his broad Scottish accent, “will you, then, go upon your death this instant?” and, ere the hapless monarch could comprehend his meaning or arrest the movement, he dragged his charger toward the rear. Then, on the instant, a strange panic fell on all around, so that they fled upon the spur, although no enemy was near them; and though, at length, the king's exertions—who spurred through the ranks beseeching them to stand, and even striking at the fugitives in impotent but noble indignation—brought them to rally and ride back toward the field, the moment had gone by! It was too late! For Fairfax, when he saw how Cromwell had succeeded on his right, and felt the consequences of his charge upon the royal foot, in the disorder of that sturdy mass, moved down at once his own lifeguard from the reserve, and brought it into action. The prince had, indeed, just returned from his insane pursuit; but his men, deeming that their part was played for that day, could not be brought to form again on charge by any effort of their leaders. And now but one battalion held its ground, a solid square of foot, presenting an impenetrable front of pikes on every side to the assailing horse, while from its inner ranks it poured a constant shower of balls, that mowed down all before it. Cromwell, meantime, was overthrowing every thing, traversing Astley's line from the left endwise toward the centre, when Fairfax, wheeling his lifeguards round upon the rear of that undaunted square, charged it himself in front. Two horses were shot under him; but, a third time remounting, he brought up his men, though shattered by the constant volleys, to renewed exertion. In the last deadly rush his helmet was torn violently off by a pike's point—the colonel of his lifeguard proffered his own—but no! bareheaded as he was, he dashed upon the spears —he hewed his way into that serried band—with his own hand he cleft the ensign of the regiment, who crossed his path, through morion and scull down to the very teeth—he waved the captured banner round his head, and threw it to a private for safe keeping, who afterward would fain have claimed the honour. That line of pikes once broken, in swept the independents with the rush of a springtide; and, where it fought, that firm battalion, refusing quarter and resisting to the last, was trodden to the earth, annihilated, but unconquered. The victory was complete, the rout disastrous! Even to the walls of Leicester Cromwell's fierce zealots did execution on the flying cavaliers; from three miles south of Harborough to nine beyond it, the country was one widespread scene of flight, and massacre, and havoc. Five thousand of the royalists were slain or taken, from an army which had mustered but eight thousand in the morning. Two hundred wagons, laden with arms and baggage, all the artillery and colours, the royal standard, and the king's own carriage, fell to the victors' share; and, above all, that fatal cabinet of letters, which—though, with a delicate and generous point of honour not often to be met with in such times, Fairfax declined to open them—when published by the orders of the parliament, proved, past all doubt or question, the utter insincerity of Charles; and his resolve—as firm at the last hour as when he first set up his standard—of reigning, if at all, a monarch irresponsible and absolute. That victory decided the campaign, and that campaign the cause of England's freedom! CHAPTER X. “To that father's heart Return, forgiving all thy wrongs, return! Speak to me, Raimond, thou wert ever kind, And brave, and gentle! Say that all the past Shall be forgiven! That word from none but thee My lips e'er ask'd. Speak to me once, my boy, My pride, my hope!” Hemans—Vespers of Palermo. The action, having raged incessantly from ten o'clock till one, sank into sudden silence after the charge of Fairfax, which, like a hurricane, swept all before it; and, ere another hour from that time elapsed, the field was utterly deserted, except by those who, having fallen in the full tide of violence and fury, now slept as soundly and as well upon the gory turf as though they had departed from their peaceful beds amid the weeping ministry of friends; or those less fortunate, who lay hopelessly writhing in their mortal agonies, “scorched with the death thirst,” and torturing the tainted air with their unheeded lamentations. The hot sun poured his steadiest and brightest rays over that scene of carnage, glancing as if in mockery upon the gorgeous dresses, the rich armour, and the noble steeds—lately so full of fiery life and beauty— which shed but now a halo of false glory over the horrors and the misery of warfare. The round-heads had withdrawn to their encampment on the hills, and were recruiting themselves, after the heat and labours of the day, in that deathlike and absolute repose which is the sweetest balm to soul and body, equally exhausted by the tension of unnatural excitement. No plunderers—those human vultores that haunt the battle-field to render horror yet more horrible—crept stealthily among the dying and the dead; for, such was the severe and ruthless discipline of Cromwell, that the few sordid spirits who necessarily mingled with the high enthusiasts of freedom and religion dared not even by night, much less in broad daylight, for their lives, to exercise their odious calling. But the ravens had already flocked in hundreds to the plain, lured by the scent of carnage from the wide woodlands of Northamptonshire and Huntingdon, and now sat perched upon the neighbouring trees, waiting the evening darkness to commence their loathsome meal, while several large kites and buzzards sailed slowly round and round in lofty circles, as fearing to alight while any breath or motion remained to their intended victims. Such was the aspect of the ground across which Edgar led his men, returning from the first pursuit of Langdale's cavalry, which he had urged—his military ardour tempered by Christian mercy—no farther than was needful to prevent their rallying that day; and it had given him more pleasure than he had felt for many a month to see with what a generous and British sentiment his men, though hot in blood, the most part wounded more or less severely, and all exasperated by the fall of many a gallant comrade, refused—even when urged by the fierce exhortations of their more fanatical commanders—to strike an unresisting foeman. While they fought front to front, their hearts were hardened and their hands unmerciful; but when the rush and fury of the conflict had passed over, they felt that those poor fugitives were countrymen and brothers. How trumpet-tongued does this fact cry aloud in the behalf of those much slandered independents, whom it has pleased the writers of grave, sober history— all either Prelatists or Presbyterians—to represent as stern, morose, bloodthirsty, and remorseless. In the protracted fight and in the hotly-urged pursuit eight hundred only of the royalists were slain, and of these more than three fourths occupied the ground whereon they fought—cut down, flagrante prœlio, with weapons in their hands; while Rupert's onset, and the massacre which followed it, needlessly savage and unsparing, alone cost Ireton's brigade more lives than the whole royal loss! The prisoners, not the slain—the prisoners and the results were the true tests and trophies of the victory at Naseby. But these were not the thoughts which crowded on the mind of Edgar as he rode sorrowfully back across the red arena of his party's triumph; he looked upon the dead, as they lay stiff and cold, outstretched in serried ranks, even where they fought and fell, like swathes before the mower's scythe—their feet toward their foemen, their grim and gory faces turned up reproachfully toward the placid heaven, their backs upon their native earth, and every wound in front; and, as he looked, in very bitterness of heart he beat his bosom with his hands till his steel corslet clattered. Not one of these but died, in his own creed, self-justified—not one but deemed himself a patriot and a martyr—the churchman as the puritan—the fiery loyalist as the severe republican—each battling for his country's right—each honestly believing his opponent the rebel or the tyrant! Alas for human reason! Alas for human error! Alas for vanity and ignorance, for blindness and presumption! Alas for right and wrong—for virtue and for vice! Where—where on earth shall we discover the distinction—how test them here below, save by the arbitry of the false harlot fortune— save by the sophist touchstone of success? At every step his charger's hoof plashed with a sickening sound in the dark curdled gore that flowed commingling from the wounds of that fine aristocracy—that old high stock of English gentlemen, polished in courts, athletic and well-skilled in every manly feat or rural exercise, second to none as scholars in the forum or as soldiers in the field, lowly in bearing to the low, open and frank among their peers, haughty and proud to their superiors! —and of that independent yeomanry, fearless, and generous, and free, remote alike from insolence and cringing, dauntless and stanch in war, blunt and sincere in peace, the children, tillers, owners of the soil! both races equally “England's peculiar and appropriate sons, known to no other land.' And wherefore lay they here, never to gladden hall or cottage more—their energies, their virtues, their devoted love lost to their native land for ever? Was it—was it, indeed, for England's good—was it, in truth, for the pure cause of liberty that they had fallen there, self-immolated victims—or was it but for man's insatiate ambition? Was it, indeed, a trial between the principles of tyranny and freedom, or a vain struggle between this and that oppressor—a conflict between principles of legalized authority and arbitrary sway, or a mere strife between the interests of Cromwell and Charles Stuart? Such were the gloomy thoughts that sat so heavy at the heart of the young conqueror; such the unanswered doubts that led him almost to distrust himself, almost to curse the hour when he joined the standard of the parliament; but it was not long ere more immediate cares, sorrows more near and kindred, diverted, if they could not overpower, the half prophetic achings of his patriotic soul. The course which Langdale's fugitives had taken, far to the right hand of the field, prevented him on his return from meeting the main tide of the king's army, which, scattered irretrievably, covered the plain toward Harborough. He therefore, rode directly to the post of Cromwell. It was near three of the afternoon when he arrived, and found the leader of the ironsides mounted again and at the head of his brigade, refreshed by their brief halt, about to set forth instantly in the pursuit. Before he started on his march, however, he handed several letters to an orderly dragoon, who stood, booted and spurred, with a broad leathern belt and a despatch bag buckled round his waist, waiting his orders. “This,” he said, “this to the honourable William Lenthal, the speaker of the commons house of parliament—with your own hand, remember, your own hand!—this to the worshipful Lord Say—this to good Master Milton—and now get you gone; let not the grass grow under your horse's hoofs—be swift and trusty. Ha! Colonel Ardenne,” he continued, his brow overclouded as he saw him, “a word with you apart;” then, as he drew him to one side, “truly the Lord,” he said, “hath blessed the general cause with mighty triumph — I may say with a great and crowning mercy—and, therefore, it behooves us not, with weak and fainting hearts, to sorrow over-deeply for our own private griefs. Surely whom the Lord loveth most he chasteneth—is not this righteous truth?” “Undoubtedly,” Edgar replied, not unsurprised by the peculiar manner of his leader; “undoubtedly it is; but wherefore say you this to me?” “Yea, and he tempereth the wind to the shorn lamb. So may he temper it to thee, humbly and fervently I trust, honest and valiant friend, in thy time of affliction. Much have I prayed and wrestled with the Lord since I did hear—” Vol. II.—F “What—what? I pray you speak, lieutenant-general, if you know aught concerning me or mine. There needeth not this tampering with the subject; I can endure to hear aught of affliction human tongue can tell me.” “Be you so strong?” said Cromwell; “man, then, your heart; for, of a truth, your father is a prisoner in the camp, sore wounded — ay, unto death, I fear me.” “Where lies he?” Edgar inquired, with a voice so preternaturally calm that Oliver himself gazed at him wondering. “Hath he had any help?” “I caused him to be borne,” Oliver answered, “down to the village yonder, even unto the house of the Episcopalian priest; two of his own domestics be about him, and General Fairfax hath sent his own chirurgeon—best hasten, though, if thou wouldst see him living. I march forthwith; but tarry thou behind until the fourth day hence—so long may I dispense with thee. Then join me at the half-way house 'twixt Harborough and Leicester, at the first hour after noon. Farewell, and may the Lord look down on thee!” The trumpets sounded, and the ironsides filed off at a sharp trot, and Edgar, mounting hastily on a fresh horse, and calling several of his body-servants to attend him, rode furiously away along the broken lanes toward Naseby. The vicarage was a low rustic tenement, distinguished from the neighbouring cottages by nothing but its superior neatness, and its close vicinity to the square ivy-mantled tower, and the yew-shadowed yard, with its low mossy graves, of the small village church. A noble lime-tree, myriads of bees humming and revelling amid its scented blossoms, overhung the grassplot in the front, and a thick growth of honeysuckle crept over the whole building, curtaining porch and roof with its close-matted verdure, and peeping with its honeyed trumpets through the latticed casements. Each hut and cottage through the hamlet had been converted into a temporary hospital for the reception of the wounded from the near battle-field; but, by the group of horses, guarded by a stout knot of troopers, and the two sturdy sentinels who kept the door, the son knew instantly the sojourn of his father. Curbing his horse so violently up that he had wellnigh fallen on his haunches, he sprang down, and rushed under the low doorway. Just as his foot was on the threshold, a person whom he judged to be the surgeon was passing outward. “How fares he?” Edgar gasped, the words half choking in his throat; “how fares your patient? Have you any hope?” The man of healing shook his head. “None— not the slightest,” he replied; “the ball hath severed all the main intestines. The hemorrhage has ceased externally, and he is easier now; mortification must ensue; he cannot live six hours! I have done all I may in quieting his agonies— man can no more.” Bending his head to veil the bitter anguish that racked his manly features, Ardenne passed onward; directed by a gesture of the silent sentinel, he entered the small parlour; and there, upon a temporary couch, the window-curtains drawn aside, the lattices thrown open to admit the slightest draught of air that might be stirring—the old steward of his household wiping the death-sweat from the massive brow and long gray locks of his loved master, while the big teardrops fell like rain down his own withered cheeks—and the white-bearded vicar kneeling in silent prayer beside the deathbed of the cavalier —there lay his father, with his high features pale and sharpened by the near approach of death, and the froth gathering round his bloodless lips, and the dark drops of icy perspiration bursting from every pore of his broad temples. No groan or murmur passed the mouth of the calm sufferer, but one sad, querulous, and oft-repeated cry, “Comes he not yet?—not yet?” but when the foot of Edgar, lightly although he set it on the floor, clinked with its jingling spurs upon his ear, he started half erect, and drew his hand across his eyes as if to clear away the gathering mists. “'Tis he,” he cried, in tones distinct and clear from the excitement of the moment, a faint flush lighting up his ashy cheeks, but instantly departing, “'tis he at length—thank God—my son! my son!” and into that son's arms he sank, and lay there as contentedly as though no cloud of anger or mistrust had ever come between them, smiling up with a faint but most kind smile into his face, and clasping his convulsed and trembling hand with all the little strength his mortal wound had left him. For many moments Edgar could find no voice—his whole frame shook with agony—he sobbed as though his very heart would burst, gazing upon the countenance of that loved parent with dry and burning eyes, and a throat choked by the convulsive spasms of a tearless sorrow. “My boy—my own boy—Edgar,” the old man faltered forth, at length, “take not on thus—oh! take not on thus bitterly. 'Tis but the course of nature —the old must die before the young; and I—why I have fallen full of years and full of honour, although myself I say it—and I am glad to die thus —thus, with your arms about me, Edgar. But I have much to say to you, and I can feel my time grows very short to say it. Our reverend friend, to whom I owe so much, good Master Winterfield, will pardon us a little while—and Anthony, old, faithful Anthony, will leave us. We have not met in many days, and we would fain be private ere we part,” and his voice failed a little, and a tear stood in his clear gray eye; “part, as we must, for ever. We will recall you,” he continued, “presently, for I would fain pray with this holy man ere I go hence to stand before my Maker.” There was a pause—a long, sad pause, as all obeyed his words, broken by nothing but the hard breathing of the wounded man and the strong sobbing of the mourner. “Edgar,” the old man said, at length, “are we alone? Have they all left us?” and then, his question being answered, “This is a sorrowful yet a most happy meeting; for I feel—I feel here,” and he laid his hand upon his breast, “that that kind heart of yours has pardoned all the wrongs, the cruel and unmanly wrongs, which I have heaped upon you. Is it not so—my boy—my kind and noble boy?” “Oh! speak not thus,” he answered, when he could force a word, “oh! speak not thus, my father; you have been ever good—too generous! too good! 'Tis I—'tis I alone, may Heaven forgive me, that have been to blame. Say only that you pardon me, and bless me, oh my father.” “No! no!” exclaimed Sir Henry, with more of energy than he had spoken yet. “I will not—I do not—for I have naught to pardon. Never— never, from your most early years—have I had cause of aught save joy and pride in you. And you were—yas! you were the joy, the pride, the only anchor, the last stay of my lone widowed heart, till England became mad, and this accursed and unnatural war rushed over us, tearing asunder every gentle link and blightiong every F 2 warm affection. But I have naught, even here, to pardon—for I have been, even here, alone to blame! But I—I too was mad!” “Oh! no,” cried the repentant son; “it was my duty to obey you—to bear with you—to do, in every thing, your bidding—” “Not so!” Sir Henry once more interrupted him. “'Tis no man's duty to obey in things against his conscience; and I was but a fool—an obstinate and merciless old fool, that would not even hear you. Nay, more! nay, more!” he cried, wringing his hands with mental torture, “rash, miserable sinner that I am, I would have slain you but for that angel girl—slain you, that would have never been within my power but for your self-devoting efforts to preserve me. And I have slain your quietude—your peace of mind for ever! blasted your hopes of fireside happiness—banished you from the dwelling of your fathers—robbed you—ay, robbed you of your heritage—divorced you from your bride—cut short your hopes of leaving your high name to sons as glorious as yourself. All this—all this, and much more have I done—much more!” and, as he spoke, he sank back quite exhausted by his own vehemence; but, in a moment, disregarding the entreaties of his son that he would not wear out his faculties with this most needless passion, “I will—I will,” he answered; “I will go through with my confession. Reach me that cup, and hear me;” he drained the draught of some mild opiate mingled with wine and water, and proceeded. “Much more of deadly sin than this! I am the murderer of Sibyl.” For an instant Edgar fancied that his intellect had failed him, and gazed hopelessly upon his face; but there was no glare of insanity, no idiot vacancy in those high pallid features. “Yes!” he continued, “I have murdered her. Have I not seen her growing paler day by day, and thinner, and more deheate and frail? Have I not seen her pining hourly away—withering beneath the blight of her affections, like flowers beneath the carliest frost-winds—and yet, at every hour, more patient, and more angel-like, and more unearthly in her pure holy loveliness? and I have done this also— this foul and gradual murder! and she will waste away before her time, and sink by inches into the cold dark grave, blessing her slayer as she dies! And thou, too, thou, my son, wilt live a sorrowing and solitary thing—for thy strong noble soul will not succumb to any violence or spite of fortune—alone upon the earth, like the last oak of a Druidic grove, when all its brother trees have fallen by the woodman's axe—magnificent, and flourishing, and stately, yet sad in all its dignity—friendless, companionless, alone! and with the worm, the never-dying worm, busily gnawing at its heart—yet happier than thee in this, that 'twas not by a father's hand its green companions fell; not by a father's hand the foul destroying worm was thrust into its bosom! No, no! it cannot be—you can not pardon me!” “All this,” said Edgar, calmly, yet much moved, though smothering his emotion; “all this is but the work of Heaven. The Lord hath willed it so, and we are but the instruments, the wretched instruments, within the hollow of his hand. If you have erred, as I say not you have, you erred in honour, and believing yourself justified; but if it be a comfort to you, hear me now, on my knees, beside your dying bed, declare, that never—never, for one short moment—have I felt any wrath or bitterness—never known any feeling toward you, dearest and most honoured father, save the most deep heart-springing reverence and love. Sorrowed I have, and deeply, that you misjudged my soul, and disapproved the course my conscience bound me to pursue; but never have I thought of you as wronging me—never presumed, nor even wished to blame you. But yet, if there be aught for which you need forgiveness from a child—oh, term most misapplied—with all my heart—with all my soul—in sight of men and angels, I bless you and forgive you, oh my father.” “And bless you,” cried the old man, “my noble-hearted boy. Heaven bless you—and it will— it must bless such as you, and prosper you with all its choicest stores, and make you tenfold compensation for your past and present sorrows;” and he drew down the lips of Edgar to his own, and clasped his arms about his neck, and their tears mingled long and silently, and their prayers went up together to the throne of mercy; and with those tears and that embrace, the bitterness passed by, the iron was drawn out from the old warrior's soul. The clergyman returned, the simple but affecting service of the church was feelingly performed, the last most holy rite partaken, both by the son and sire, the servants were called in—the faithful followers of their lord through weal and wo—and a faint smile, a sad farewell, a kindly pressure of the honoured hand, dismissed each, weeping, not as for a master, but rather as for a friend and father, from the low chamber; and once again the father and the son were left in solitude. There they remained for hours; the old man, while his painful breathing shock the couch beneath him, calm, patient, and serene—the stately son bowed down, and bent, as if by age, clasping the languid hand that grew at every instant sensibly colder and more pulscless, and sorrowing as one who would not be consoled, although he choked his anguish, lest it should but increase his father's sufferings. The bright warm sun had long since sunk into the west, and his last flush had faded from the sky; yet so mild was the evening air that every lattice was still thrown wide open, and the rich odour of the woodbine and sweetbrier rose more profusely on the senses when the plants were steeped in the pure dews of summer. And now the dark blue skies grew gradually lighter, as the moon, near her full, soared slowly and serenely over the distant trees. There was a whispering of the breeze in the top branches of the lime, and from the odorous shrubs in a far corner of the garden a solitary nightingale, awakened by the glorious lustre of the planet, started at once into its wild and melancholy flood of song. The dying man, who had sunk into a long and tranquil slumber, moved now uneasily; he made an effort to turn over, and the pain caused by the motion roused him, “Sibyl,” he muttered, hardly yet awake, “Sibyl, your song is wondrous sweet to-night, but why so sad? it should be gay as summer after this blessed union. Ah!” he continued, “ah!” as consciousness returned, “I dreamed —I have slept pleasantly, and dreamed a most delicious dream. Is it late, Edgar?” “The clock hath just chimed ten,” Edgar replied, “I would have called for lights, but feared to waken you—shall I now do so?” “No,” he said, faintly, “no, it matters not now. How calm it is, and sweet—the blessed moonlight streams in through the casement like Heaven's own mild forgiveness into a sinner's bosom: Edgar, when I am gone, say to my poor, poor Sibyl, that, on my happy deathbed, my sole regret was that I could not join her hand with yours for ever. She will be yours now—now that this miserable war is ended—for it is ended, Edgar, and I regret its termination less that I have lately seen much in Charles Stuart—in the king—that I had disbelieved or shut my eyes upon before. He hath, I must confess it, dealt insincerely with his nearest counsellors. He hath kept up a secret intercourse with the wild Irish rebels, through that ill-minded Antrim; and, I much fear me, he was privy to, and instigated their first bloody rising under the bigoted and barbarous O'Neill. Weak, obstinate, and prejudiced he is, beyond all doubt, proud and uxorious. I know that he stands pledged in private to his queen never to give peace to his people unless by her consent—and all this done against the counsels and without the knowledge of those men who have a right to counsel him, ay! and know his measures—since for him they have risked their all!—done in deep malice to his enemies —in deeper guile to whom he calls his friends! Out! out! I say, upon such kingcraft! A good man he may be, but—it will out—a bad king! But enough of this. She will be yours, and you will both be happy yet—as I am now—most happy! How soothing is that sad bird's note—I could almost believe it is prophetic—how beautiful—how beautiful!” He was again for some time silent, as though absorbed in listening or in thought; and Edgar, who well knew his end was very near at hand, was motionless, and almost breathless; his heart was far too full for words. At length the old man spoke once more, but now his voice was very faint and low, and all its accents were so altered that his nearest friend could not have recognised a tone—and his words came at intervals, quivering, and slow, and interrupted. “How exquisite,” he said, “how exquisite this tranquil bliss. Never—no, never—felt I such complete peace before—such perfect happiness. Edgar—my time— is drawing—near. My feet grow numb and cold. Kiss me—boy—kiss me. The bird hath ceased his song;” even while he spoke, its notes were filling every corner of the chamber with its most thrilling melody. “The moon hath set,” yet she was streaming full on his uncurtained couch; “all— all is dark—and silent. Time—it is time—to die! My boy—my own boy. Bless you — Sibyl!— Sibyl!” It was all over—the spirit had departed to its God.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CROMWELL. BOOK III. “There can be slain No sacrifice to God more acceptable Than an unjust and wicked king.” Milton—from Senecs. Vol. II.—G CHAPTER I. “The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power; and, to speak truth of Cæsar, I have not known when his affection swayed More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof That lowliness is young ambition's ladder, Whereto the climber upward turns his face; But, when he once attains the topmost round, He then unto the ladder turns his back, Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend.” Julius Cæsar. Two full years had gone round since the defeat of Naseby had paralyzed the efforts and destroyed the hopes of Charles Stuart's party. During the whole remainder of that fatal year—even when winter had set in with its most keen severity—the arms of Cromwell swept like a hurricane over the western and the midland counties. No leader could compete with him on terms of vantage or equality—no forces stand against him in the field —no town or garrison resist his prowess. Chief after chief was beaten in detail; stronghold upon stronghold surrendered, or was stormed sword in hand; till, to conclude the whole, Winchester and the long-disputed post of Baring House were taken, and Astley, on the 21st of March—the sole commander of the king's now at the head of any power—suffered so total a defeat at Stow-on-the-Wold, being himself made prisoner, with sixteen hundred of his men, that he said frankly to his captors, “My masters, you have done your work, and may go play, unless you please now to fall out among yourselves.” His fortunes in the field being thus utterly disastrous, after some fruitless efforts at negotiation with the parliament and with the Independent leaders—negotiation marked by all his usual chicane and insincerity—on the fifth day of May Charles threw himself into the quarters of the Earl of Leven, then besieging Newark. How the Scots dealt with their unhappy monarch—who, whatsoever were his faults, undoubtedly confided in their honour—the world knows, for it has become a brand of national reproach. Treated, from the first moment when they found he would not guarantee their Covenant, and promise to establish Presbyterian rule throughout the land, not as a prisoner merely, but with indignity and insult—how, Judaslike, they sold him to the parliament, and gave him up to Skippon, like a mere thing of merchandise, on payment of two hundred thousand pounds, is history. But not so, that it was several times in the unfortunate king's power to escape to France or Holland, but that the menacing and angry letters of his false queen, who had her own peculiar reasons for dreading a reunion with her injured husband at this moment, prevented him till it was all too late, and, in effect, consigned him to the block. That the uxorious and weak king was mainly prompted to the war by the ill counsels of his adulterous wife, is evident. Her pride—her education— her hereditary prejudices—her selfwill—nay, her very birth itself, made it but natural that she should aim at arbitrary power, and urge her husband, himself obstinate as weak, to that insane and suicidal policy which ultimately proved his ruin. But that, herself in safety, she should, with cool determined infidelity, insist on his remaining among his deadly enemies, when hope was itself at an end, would seem incredible, were it not fixed beyond a doubt by the existence of her threatening letters and his heart-broken answers. Immediately on his surrender to the parliament he was removed to Holmby Castle, where he remained in close though honourable custody, served and attended as a king, and suffered to indulge in all his favourite recreations, though strictly watched, and vigilantly hindered from any secret correspondence with his friends, and even interdicted from communion with ministers of the Episcopalian church. At this very time there was in progress a desperate struggle between the Presbyterians and the army. The former, having already utterly suppressed Episcopacy through the realm, proceeded with the sternest and most bigoted intolerance of persecution against all sects, Papist or Protestant, clearly demonstrating their resolution to subject the whole kingdom to a system of church governance, connected with the state, under the Presbyterian form, as fully organized as that which they had just put down, and ten times more obnoxious to domestic freedom—ten times more rigid, fierce, inquisitorial, and tyrannical. Against these measures the Independents, who, although a minority in both houses, were formidable from the talents of the leaders, the enthusiasm of the mass, the real justice of their cause, and, above all, from the fact that they possessed the power of the sword, the army being almost unanimously in their favour, offered all constitutional opposition—but to no purpose. Petition after petition was presented, only to be contemned and disregarded. Just at this moment it was rumoured, and, as was shortly proved, most truly, that the parliament was now preparing to disband the army without payment of its long arrears, and then to re-enlist it, under Presbyterian officers, for the conquest of rebellious Ireland—a plot most cunningly devised, could it have been effected, for wresting their ascendency from Ireton and Cromwell, and rendering themselves unquestioned masters of the state. This instantly gave rise to mutinies the most alarming; the army organized itself into political divisions—the privates, under their adjutators, elected two from every regiment, and the officers forming a superior council— and treated with the parliament, as a species of fourth estate, holding itself under arms, and ready for offensive action. At the first of this crisis Cromwell opposed the mutineers with such apparent energy and zeal, that, for a time, he lost his popularity with his own soldiery; and, shortly afterward, having been accused, or, at the least, suspected, in the house, of underhanded tampering with the mutineers, he cleared himself to the full satisfaction of all present by a most vehement and overpowering burst of indignation, mingled with tears, and prayers, and explanations, such as removed from every mind all doubts of his integrity. Shortly, however, fresh suspicions were excited among the Presbyterian leaders, who, dark and wily in their own secret machinations, naturally feared the like manœuvres from their political opponents. By some means it leaked out that a new Presbyterian army was to be raised forthwith, the veteran host compelled to disband at the sword's point, and Cromwell, Ireton, and Harrison—the champions of the Independents—committed to the Tower. Thus forced, in self-defence, to concur in those very movements which they had first opposed as mutiny—unless they should prefer to submit G 2 tamely to their own destruction, and to the overthrow of all those principles of civil and religious freedom for which they had so long and painfully contended—the military chieftains acted with all that rapid and decisive energy which had continually signalized their conduct in the field. The instant they had ascertained the truth of these reports, one Joyce, a man of well-proved resolution, though by rank only cornet in Whalley's regiment of horse, was sent to Holmby to secure the person of the king, who was conducted with all the speed consistent with respect to the headquarters of the army; and such was the considerate and honourable bearing of the soldiery toward their captive monarch, that, on Fairfax disavowing Joyce's enterprise and offering to send him back to Holmby, he at once replied that “naught but force should urge him to it.” And, in good truth, the difference of his situation was so great as well to justify his preference; and could he even then have laid aside dissimulation, and acted with straightforward singleness of purpose, it is most certain he might again have filled the throne of his fathers. Both parties were, indeed, at this time willing, nay, desirous, to reinstate the sovereign; for such a union as that measure would have caused with the still powerful, though beaten, faction of the cavaliers, would have placed either permanently in the ascendant. The Presbyterians proffered to replace him on the throne, provided he would yield assent to the substitution of a Presbytery for the established Church of England, endowed with all its ancient privileges, to the absolute suppression of all other sects; and farther, to such cessions of prerogative as would have left him but the shadow of a sceptre. The Independents stipulated merely for universal toleration—excepting only papistry, which they insisted he should extirpate entirely, root and branch—and for the full securing to all men of every constitutional and civil privilege. In either case his life and throne would have been both secured to him; yet could he not refrain from playing off the one against the other faction, till both had learned that they could place no confidence in his sincerity or truth. While he continued with the army, all was, for a long time, comparatively sunshine; at Cromwell's intercession, his children—the young Dukes of York and Gloucester, and the Princess Elizabeth—were suffered constantly to visit him, and to remain in his society. Two chaplains of his own persuasion—an indulgence sternly refused him by the parliament—were granted willingly by the commanders of the soldiery, who, while they asserted their own liberty to worship as they chose —to preach and pray themselves, and listen to the exhortations, not of licensed gospellers, but of their own military saints—consistent at the least in this —were willing to concede to others, unlike the bitterer Presbyterians, the same rights which they stickled for themselves. Fortified now by possessing, not the person only, but the confidence and favour of the king, the army moved toward London. From Newmarket they marched to Royston, Reading, and then Windsor; and at the latter place Charles occupied his royal castle. Thence, after some delay, advancing, they encamped on Hounslow, their leaders holding constant although guarded intercourse with their now trembling and half discomfited opponents. Early in August the king was reinstalled in Hampton Court, and all things seemed to be once more his own. His yeomen of the wardrobe and the guard attended him; he was permitted to hold levees of all parties; all his own favourite advisers were permitted to resort to him, including several under the ban of parliament. There was, as it were, a general amnesty and reconciliation. Members of both the houses visited him; Cromwell and Ireton held close and constant intercourse with him; and so sincere were these in their intention to befriend him, that they actually commenced a correspondence with the queen's emissaries, and suffered Berkeley, Legge, and Ashburnham once more to take their places in his council. The adjutators of the regiments elected by the privates, and members from the council of the officers, attended him with terms so advantageous, that Sir John Berkeley openly declared, that “a crown so near lost was never yet so easily recovered as this would be, were things adjusted on these terms.” Yet even then, hoping for something more, he haughtily and scornfully rejected and, plunging headlong into a fresh scheme with Lauderdale, assented to the covenant, on the condition that he should be brought at once to Westminster; which he had the folly to believe would place him where he was in power before the outbreak of hostilities. The citizens of London and the militia of that city greedily entered on the scheme, and signed the covenant by thousands! Both houses instantly voted this an act of treason against England; but on that very night their doors were forced by a tumultuous and infuriate mob of Presbyterians, mingled with concealed royalists—their persons were assailed with violence and insult—their very lives endangered! Compelled by imminent and sudden peril, they passed a hasty vote sanctioning the return of Charies, but the next instant voted an adjournment, as unable to deliberate with liberty of conscience; and straightway a large party of both houses, with the speakers, Manchester and Lenthall, at their head, withdrew from the disordered capital, and finally repaired to seek protection in the camp at Hounslow. In the mean time, the violent presumption of the king, unduly elevated by his supposed success, and instigated farther by the intriguing Ashburnham, induced him actually to treat with contumely the adjutators of the army, openly refusing to concede the smallest jot of his prerogative, and even intimating his intention again to force Episcopacy on the Scots. Inflamed to madness by this strange tergiversation, the soldiers flew to arms; and a strong party forced their way into the chambers of Lord Lauderdale, then in the palace, and compelled him to return, having held no communication with the king, direct to London. A few days after this, with the most perfect shamelessness, the king in public solemnly disavowed his dealings with the Covenanters, and once more professed entire confidence in the commanders of the army, and feigned a vehement desire to come to settled terms with them. In London the remnant of the houses commenced a weak and futile effort at resistance; they called out the militia of the city, appointing Waller and Massey to command their raw tumultuary levies, repaired the fortifications, and, in short, had every thing in readiness for action except energy and courage. After a rendezvous on Hounslow Heath, the parliamentary seceders were welcomed by the excited soldiery with the loudest acclamations and the sincerest tokens of affection. A convention, held at Sion House, whereat Fairfax and his superior officers assumed their seats in common with the members of both houses, decided the whole question; and on the sixth of August the army entered London, without experiencing a shadow of resistance, their colours flying and their drums beating through the streets! That same day the seceders were reinstated in their seats by the strong hand of military power! the General Fairfax was appointed Constable of the Tower, and a thanksgiving voted with no dissentient voice either of peers or commons! Thus was the triumph of the Independents finally determined, and themselves raised to power not soon again to fall. It was the second day after the entrance of the army that Sir Edgar Ardenne, elevated to the baronetcy by his father's death—who, though becoming gradually more and more doubtful of the purity of Cromwell's motives, had played his part as gallantly as heretofore throughout the long campaign of '46 and '47, and even shared in the deliberations and proceedings of the army as opposed to the yet darker machinations of the parliament — walked forth to seek for some solution of his apprehensions in the deep wisdom of his friend John Milton. His mind had, in truth, long been in a dubious and unsettled state; the tyranny of Charles, against which he had taken arms in the beginning, was something palpable and obvious, as was his leaning toward Romish doctrines, and his inclination to fritter down as much as possible the broad distinction between the Catholic and Episcopalian churches. It was, however, rather against the king's aggression upon civil freedom than against the abuses of the church that he had warred, although he saw the latter in so clear a light that he felt no repugnance to make common cause with those who viewed them as the greater evil. Now, when the first oppressor was reduced, the first assailants of religious freedom beaten and trampled under foot, it seemed too probable that a new hydra-headed tyranny would spring up from the down-fallen despotism, and greater outrages on liberty of conscience follow than those which had called England into arms. Such was, indeed, the certain course of things, if, in the present struggle, the parliament should regain the ascendency—which body, it was evident, under the strong plea of necessity, had already most alarmingly extended their boasted privilege, leaving all the assumptions of prerogative immeasurably in the rear, and which, now that the conflict was decided, showed little disposition to lay down their dear-bought power. Himself a follower of the Church of England, Sir Edgar had seen little to find fault with in the old establishment, except an over-rigour and a want of toleration, which he would have extended to all seets, except the Catholics, who were, in those days, truly formidable, from their determined spirit of conversion, their bigotry, and, above all, their undissembled inclinatron toward arbitrary government. He therefore looked upon the stern and overstrained morality of the Presbytery with feelings of so deep dislike, that he would almost have surrendered all the gains of the late war to hinder its establishment as a predominating state-religion, although he would have gladly suffered it in common with all other Protestant denominations. With these views he had naturally joined the Independents in their contest with the parliament; but now that they had gained the day, he was yet ill at ease. A fierce fanatical hoplocracy would be, it was self-evident, the very worst of governments, and utterly subversive of the English liberties and coustitution. The wavering and dishonest policy of Charles rendered his restoration all but impossible; while, in the deep-laid and unfathomable mysteries of Cromwell's course, Ardenne began to foresee daily more and more cause for apprehension and for caution. Still, such were the rare talents of the man, such his inexplicable influence over the minds of all whom he encountered, that, while Sir Edgar doubted, he was compelled to grant that he had no cause for doubt which he could make clear to himself, much less to others. At times he fancied his religious ecstasies mere hypocritic jargon, adopted so to mystify all eyes and veil his deep ambition; at others— and that, too, most soberly and often—he believed him a wild, self-deceiving hypochondriac—an erring, though sincere enthusiast. Hitherto all that Oliver had done had doubtless been of service to the cause of veritable freedom; and it was certain that his present opposition to the Presbyterians might prove quite as unselfish, quite as beneficial to the commonwealth as his preceding opposition to the king. Still it was too apparent to escape the foresight of a politican so clear-headed and far-reaching as Sir Edgar, that, if the military faction should gain firm foothold in the state, Cromwell would not lack either talent, opportunity, or power to mount even to the topmost summits of ambition, if he should feel the inclination to attempt them. And who, when all things most magnificently tempting shall lie prone, subject to his mere will, yea, courting him to grasp them—when to dare almost seems a virtue—to refrain a despicable weakness—who can, in such a situation, answer for another—who even for himself? Revolving such thoughts in his mind, and eager to unbosom himself to some true friend, Sir Edgar took his way, as has been said, the second evening after the occupation of the city by the troops, toward the dwelling of John Milton. The controversialist had changed his domicil during this troubled period, and now occupied a smaller house in Holborn, opening backward upon Lincoln's Inn. It was a lovely evening as ever smiled upon the earth which Ardenne had selected for his visit to the patriotic poet. The setting sun, that alchymist of nature, shone out so brilliantly from an unclouded sky, that even the great wilderness of walls and chimneys, for once seen through a purer medium than their accustomed canopy of fog and smoke, looked cheerfully. The same grave-eyed and sober-looking servitor who had admitted him at his last visit six long years before, opened the door; and, in reply to his inquiry, informed him that Master Milton was within, but in his garden; and, ushering him into a small parlour, decked with the selfsame dark-green hangings, offered to call his master; but, declining his civility, Sir Edgar walked himself into the narrow stripe of garden, planted with a few lilachs and laburnums, all besmirched and dingy from the effects of the London atmosphere. At first he saw not any thing of him he sought; but, in a moment after, he distinguished the full solemn voice, whose cadences, once heard, could never be forgotten, proceeding from a little arbour facing the western sun, and covered by a mass of annual creepers such as may easily be reared even upon the meanest plat of soil. The sounds, however, were not as of one engaged in conversation, but resembled rather the accents of a person thinking aloud, or possibly composing what might be afterward committed to the safer guardianship of paper. The words which reached his ear as he advanced were these, at no long period subsequently published in the poem styled II Penseroso. “The high-embowed roof With antique columns massy proof, And storied windows richly dight Casting a dim religious light: Vol. II.—H There let the pealing organ blow, To the full-voiced quire below, In service high and anthems clear As may with sweetness through mine ear Diseolve me into ecstasies, And bring all heaven before mine eyes.” That which was most peculiar in the manner of the speaker, if, as Ardenne suspected, he were pronouncing thoughts which for the first time now were couched in language, was, that they flowed in one melodious and uninterrupted stream, unbroken by the slightest pause or hesitation, and running, as it were, into spontaneous melody; as unpremeditated as the music of a bird, the murmuring of a rivulet, or any other natural sound that soothes the ear of man with untaught harmony. He had not, however, much time to drink in the sweet and solemn verses, for the quick ear of the poet—quicker, perhaps, as his sense of vision year after year became less vigorous—detected an approaching footstep on the gravel walk; and, ceasing instantly from his employment, he stepped forth to meet his visiter. The countenance of Milton was but little altered, embalmed as it were by his passionless and peaceful avocations, excepting that perhaps the furrows on his expansive forehead—furrows of thought, not age—were somewhat deeper, and the whole expression of his lineaments more subdued and even melancholy than when they last met his friend's eye. The change, if change there were, was slight indeed as compared with the havoc which anxiety, grief, hardship, and exposure, more than time, had wrought on the fine features of Sir Edgar Ardenne. His glance was, indeed, bright as ever—his carriage as erect and dignified—his limbs as muscular, nay, even as elastic. But the high manly beauty—the triumphant energy—the soul out-flashing from the face at every new emotion—the flush of youth— the glorious radiancy of a fresh mind—were utterly extinct for ever. The features were, indeed, the same in their proud classic mould, save that the nose was sharpened, and that the mouth so firmly set, rarely or never now relaxed into that playful smile that used to light up the whole countenance like sudden sunshine. Deep lines were visible, not on the forehead only, but hard and sharply cut from either nostril downward. His hair, still soft and waving, was streaked in many places with premature and wintry gray; and, more than all, a dull dead shadow had settled down upon him with a gloom like that which an autumnal cloud will cast upon a landscape that, scarce a minute past, was laughing in its sunniest loveliness. At first sight Milton scarcely recognised his friend and pupil; and when at length he framed a half apology, attributing the blame to his own “great infirmity, becoming,” as he said, “as each morn rose on its preceding night, but more and more decided.” “I thank you,” answered Ardenne, grasping the soft hand of the scholar with warm affection, “I thank you for your kindly artifice; but I well know that hard seasons, and yet harder fortunes, have so far changed me, that, were my mother living, she scarce could recognise her son in the gray weather-beaten soldier that alone remains of him. But, after all, what matters it? what matters it that our frail bodies should wear out and wither, when even thus they outlive empires! But let us in— if I may so far trespass on your leisure—my mind is ill at ease, and I would fain cast off some of its secret burdens into ears which I know friendly, wise, and trustworthy.” Milton assented with a kindly but grave gesture; sympathizing more deeply than could have been expected, from his unworldly habits and philosophic style of thought, in the appalling change which he was well aware could have been only wrought by singular affliction on the aspect of a man whom he knew by experience, to be calmer and more disciplined of mind than the most chastened of his austere contemporaries. They walked in silence to the house, for too full were the hearts of both to vent themselves in any converse of small moment; but, when once seated in the quiet parlour, Ardenue at once broke silence. “I have,” he said, “methinks, more than a common claim on you for that advice and information which I believe no man can so well afford me; seeing that it was owing mainly to your exhortations that I determined on embarking actively upon that stream of circumstances which has all blindly swept me onward to this pass. Obedient —or, I should rather say, convinced by those your exhortations, I have been, as you know, a faithful and unflinching, if unimportant, actor in the events which have dethroned the king—abolished the established church—and, to conclude, laid the whole realm—laws, liberties, and lives of Englishmen—at the precarious mercy of an armed and zealot multitude. In thus pursuing the dictates of your advice not less than of my conscience, I devoted myself wholly to what I then believed my country's good. I have lost—sacrificed—every thing! I am alone among the ruins of my house —a sole and thunder-stricken column left standing when its temple hath for ever fallen. My father died at Naseby—my only consolation, that he forgot our differences, and blessed me ere he passed away. My betrothed bride—you saw her once in our young days of hope and promise, and know her priceless worth—is perishing by inches of a pined and broken heart. But this—ay! all this I could bear, were it not that dark fears have grown into my soul till I doubt every thing—almost my own integrity and honour. A busy voice is whispering at my heart that I have forfeited all that makes life a blessing—nay, more, that I have aided in destroying all those most dear to me, and in the chase of a vain phantom! And more, yet more than this—that in the very chase I have but been the sport and mockery of a falsehood. I feel, I see, that England has been deluged with the blood of her free sons—her valleys fattened with the corpses of her best and bravest—her wise and pious prelates driven from out their spheres of usefulness—her monarch, justly, I grant, but fatally, held captive in the very palaces of his forefathers—her constitution plunged into the wildest jeopardy. All this I feel—I see. The havoc and the misery, the desolation and the peril! But, when I look forward, all is blank and hopeless. The worst view, anarchy in the state, and persecution in the church! For government—an army of sectarians and schismatics—fanatical, and ignorant, and savage! For council—a small knot of officers; wild visionary madmen, like Harrison and Lilburne—enthusiasts, like Ireton—or hypocrites and mercenary knaves, like hundreds I could name, but need not! and for church—an austere, intolerant, morose, heart-chilling discipline—paralyzing every noble aspiration—condemning every innocent and lawful pleasure—hardening, and, at the same time, lowering every heart—confounding every real standard—narrowing all distinctions between vice and virtue—converting men into mere hypocrites, or, worse, into mere misanthropes and brutes! This is the darker side of the picture; H 2 turn it! and the best view—truly, the more I look upon it, the more sure do I feel that it will come to pass—the best view is the resurrection of a stronger dynasty—stronger, because supported by a standing army, founded upon a conquest, erected on the ruins of all that did oppose its predecessor, and cannot oppose it—a dynasty, with for its founder and its head, mightier and more dangerous a thousand fold than Charles, because more wise, more valiant, and more virtuous—start not, my friend, at what I am about to say—with for its tyrant—Cromwell!” “I have heard you without interruption,” answered Milton, in his rich, persuasive tones, “but with sorrow, with attention, and with wonder. Sorrow—that you have lain beneath the burden of affliction, such as no fainting pilgrim of us all could bear and live, did we not know that such is but the test which the Supreme Artificer applies to try the temper and the metal of our souls—the purgative, like fire under the rude ores of the mine, by which he fits our corrupt bodies to put on incorruption. Attention—for that, although I trust to show them baseless as the morning vapours which disappear before the all-pervading daylight, your prognostics are fraught deeply with the world's wisdom, and your views of the presbytery entirely sound and solid. Wonder—that you should doubt, or anywise distrust, the purest and sincerest patriot, the most upright judge, the stoutest man-of-war, the trustiest and most pains-taking Christian that the Lord hath raised up, since the old days of Israel's glory, to vindicate the liberties and wipe away the sorrows of an oppressed and groaning people.” “I rejoice much,” Edgar replied, “to hear that much is your opinion. I cannot say, indeed, that I so much distrust him as I do the tide of circumstances which seem to flow on irresistibly toward his elevation. Charles never can again sit on the throne; no party can place confidence in him; myself I would not see him there, for whensoever he should fancy he had gained the power, so surely as we two are here conversing now, would he renew these struggles. He is in heart—by habit—by his very blood, a despot. But let me profit by your wisdom—to what end do you look, whether for sorrow or rejoicing?” “The lieutenant-general,” answered Milton, “has gone hence but now—scarcely an hour before you came. Indeed, he passed a great part of the morning with me in grave disputation; for we did not, nor do we yet, agree. He would replace Charles Stuart in the high places of his fathers, dreading the tyranny of the parliament more than he dreads the despotism of the king—the persecutions of the Presbyterians beyond the persecutions of the Prelatists.” “Indeed!” Sir Edgar answered, in great astonishment; “indeed! Then have I much misjudged him. Restore Charles Stuart! I should have thought he would have stricken off his right hand sooner!” “He would do so, however,” Milton replied; “beyond all doubt he would. He deems he has devised a scheme to fetter him within the bounds of lawful power. Besides, he trusts his gratitude —mistaken trust, I fear me, on most unstable grounds. He parted hence almost in anger, for that I thwarted him and held his project naught.” “And the terms?” asked Sir Edgar; “what be the terms on which he would restore him?” “Certain improvements in the freedom of elections,” returned the other, “and in the rights of parliament. The military power both by land and sea, and the creation of all great officers of state, to be for ten years vested solely in that body. No person who has warred against the parliament to sit for five years, whether as peer or commoner, or to hold any office. No peers created since the removal of the privy seal in '42 to sit without permission of both houses. All grants made by the king since that same date to be held void; all by the lords and commons valid. The liturgy not to be enjoined, nor yet the covenant enforced, but all coercive power to be taken from the bishops and the clergy. The king, queen, and the royal issue, except in these points, to resume all their old powers and prerogatives without restriction; and, lastly, an indemnity, to all but five delinquents, to be granted in behalf of those who have served for the king, whether in camp or council.” “And does the king consent?” Ardenne inquired once more. “Surely he does,” the poet answered; “he were mad to refuse conditions which, fallen as he is, he could have scarce even hoped for.” “It would work well,” said Edgar, musing very deeply. “It would work excellently well if the king might be trusted. But—I fear still. At all events, the zeal of Cromwell to promote this settlement argues that I have been unjust in my suspicions. Yes, I have greatly wronged him. But you said that you differed from his views, and that he went hence ireful and chafing. I pray you tell me—what, then, are your opinions?” “Mine?” replied Milton; “my opinions are but the musings of a solitary bookman, unskilled in court or council—neither a statesman nor a politician; yet, such as they be, you shall have them. I would see England free! free and unshackled, as was Rome in her fresh days of glory, ere she had bowed the knee to any Kaisar; as Greece, when she spurned forth the countless myriads of the oriental king from her unviolated shores, and reared herself a bright example, pure and immortal, of liberty unquenched, unquenchable! I would see England subject to law, to reason, and to God— bending the neck to none—`rousing herself, like a strong man after sleep, and shaking her invincible locks!' I would `see her as an eagle, muing her mighty youth, and kindling her undazzled eyes at the full midday beam!' yea, spreading forth to the four winds of heaven her long-abused and fettered pinions, superbly floating in her pride of place, unscathed amid the lightnings of the empyrean! And wherefore, I would ask you, not? Consider what we are and have been—`a nation, not slow nor dull, but of a quick, ingenious, and piercing spirit, acute to invent, subtile and sinewy to discourse, not beneath the reach of any point the highest that human capacity can soar to!' A nation not luxurious nor effeminate, but of a hardihood surpassing that, I say not of the frivolous, light Frenchman, not of the polished and effete Italian, not of the indolent Castilian, but of the frugal Transylvanian, the winter-tempered Russ, the mountain Switzer! A nation boasting itself the freeborn offspring of the free! a nation that rolled back the flood of Roman war from its interior fastnesses, when Rome was at the mightiest! a nation that shall yet—once freed from the soul-galling yoke of monarchy—the spirit-killing sway of Prelatists, and peers, and papists—send forth her arms, her laws, her language, and, above all, the lights of her religion, to the remotest corners of the habitable earth, securely throned on her sea-circled pinnacle of glory, o'er-shadowing the lands with her dominion, sweeping the ocean-waves with her renown!” “Dreams—dreams!” replied Ardenne, shaking his head mournfully; “beautiful—beautiful dreams, but baseless! Methought that you had studied history more narrowly. There never has been, from the world's birth till now—there never shall be, henceforth to the day when the great trump shall sound—a true republic! Rome, when her kings were banished, was an aristocracy—a wise, poor, frugal, brave, paternal aristocracy; foot after foot her nobles yielded to the flood of what her demagogues styled freedom; the moment when she became republican or democratic, which you will, that moment held her up a prize to the successful soldier. Her history was thenceforth—corruption, anarchy, bloodshed, proscription, Cæsar! And what was Athens? If for a little while she stood cemented by external wars, which forced her to be single and united, what was her government but a succession of bright usurpations—of aggressions on the people's rights—abuses of the people's power, till, at the last, democracy prevailed; and then — the thirty tyrants! Sparta, from first to last, was the most close and austere oligarchy the earth has ever witnessed—ay, oligarchy within oligarchy—an irresponsible and highborn senate, holding their sway for life over an oligarchy of six thousand warrior Dorians; who in turn domineered with a most iron sceptre over their myriads of subordinate Laconians, myriads of scourged and tortured Helots! These! these are your bright examples—these the republics of the universe! For you will hardly quote me Venice—Genoa— Florence—wherein not all a Petrarch's or an Ariosto's glory could veil the degradation of the slavish mob—the tyrant insolence of the brute nobles. Dreams, I say once again — beautiful, but still dreams! Alas, for human nature! how can we look to see republics stand, unless we hope for wisdom and for virtue in the councils and the actions of the mass—how hope for these when human reason and Divine authority tell us alike, and tell us truly, that the majority of men are ignorant and prone to evil! But now, truce to discussion; you have relieved my mind, at all events, from one great dread—of having been, in truth, while I supposed myself, in some degree, a champion of my country's weal, the mere tool of one man's ambition. This was the point on which I chiefly sought your counsel, and I am satisfied. And now let us to lighter and more pleasing matters. I heard your voice, as I approached the arbour, composing, as I fancied, some new poem.” “A trifle—a mere trifle,” answered the other, as if half reluctant to descant on such a subject; but Ardenne's end was gained; the thread of their original discourse was broken, and, turning thence to poetry and the chief literary topics of the day, a conversation followed, which, though of interest enough to those who held it, was scarce of such importance as to warrant its transmission to posterity. CHAPTER II. “Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness, For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure Ay, such a pleasure as encaged birds Conceive, when, after many moody thoughts, At last, by notes of household harmony, They quite forget their loss of liberty. But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free, And chiefly, therefore, I thank God and thee.” King Henry VI.—Part 3d. It was a lovely summer morning, with a soft west wind just ruffling the bosom of the silver Thames, and wantoning among the graceful foliage of the tall trees, and slenderer though not less beautiful exotics, which still adorn in such profusion the gardens of that palace built by the haughty Wolsey, but destined soon to pass into the hands of his bluff master, and to descend to his posterity as one of the most fair abodes of England's royalty. In a magnificent apartment overlooking those unrivalled gardens, its ceiling gorgeously painted in Italian frescoes with some of the most picturesque creations of the Grecian fable, its walls draped with brocaded damask bordered with arabesques of gold two feet in width, and decorated with the master-pieces of Vandyck and Lely, in all but power a king, sat Charles, gazing out with a sad but quiet eye upon the flowery parterres, adorned with many an urn and statue—the trimly-shaven lawns—the odorous thickets—and the alleys green, with the broad monarch of his kingdom's rivers flashing out brightly in the sunshine between the fluttering leaves. His children were about him; the Duke of York, the eldest, leaning upon his father's knee, and looking up into his face as conscious of the melancholy air, which had become almost habitual to those unmarked but comely features, yet ignorant of the dark causes which had there imprinted it; the younger Duke of Gloucester, and Elizabeth, his little sister—just at that happy age when tears are but as April showers, succeeded instantly by smiles, when sorrows pass away and leave no sting behind—were busily employed imprisoning, beneath a Venice goblet, a painted butterfly, which, lured by a display of lovely summer flowers bloomin a large crystal vase upon the table, had flitted in through the tall casements but to be made a prize by the admiring children. A louder laugh than usual, joyously bursting from the lips of the young girl, diverted the king's mind for a moment from his sad reflections. “My little girl,” he said, half sorrowfully smiling, “you would not persecute the pretty butterfly; see how it beats its painted wings against the walls of its transparent prison, and rubs off all the downy colours that you thought so beautiful. Know, my Elizabeth, that poor imprisoned fly would now be fluttering far away over the sunny gardens, in the sweet morning air, sipping the dew from every flower, happy and free; and you, by shutting it up here, have made it very wretched; and it will pine and die. See, it grows weak already; would not my darling sorrow for the poor butterfly if she should find it lying dead upon its prison floor tomorrow?” The child stared wonderingly, with her great blue eyes wide open, upon her father, for he spoke with a degree of serious and simple pathos, caused, perhaps, by a sense of sympathy with the slight insect, caged like himself, though in a splendid prison; but, as he ceased, a big tear swelled upon Vol. II.—I the lashes of either bright orb, and slid slowly down over her rosy cheeks. “I did not want,” she said, “to make the butterfly unhappy. Will it die, papa, now, if I let it fly away?” “No, my sweet child,” he answered, “it will revive directly; all that it wants is the fresh air, and liberty to go where it pleases.” “Then farewell, pretty butterfly,” she cried, half weeping and half smiling, as she released the captive. “I should not love to be a prisoner myself, Go and be very happy. See! see! he is gone already!” “Heaven, in its mercy, grant you never may, my child,” Charles answered solemnly; “but, if it should please God that evil men should shut you up, you must be very patient, and not hate those who hurt you, but forgive them, and say your prayers for them to your great King and Father in his holy heaven, that he may pardon them, and turn their hearts.” “Do you do so, papa,” she said—“do you do so? For I heard you say one day that you were a prisoner—though this pretty room can hardly be a prison—for I thought a prison was a dark place under ground, all barred with iron grates, and very terrible. Do you forgive your enemies?” “Surely I do, my little girl,” he answered, “else would not God forgive me. But, now, go play— for, see here, some one comes to speak with me;” and, as he said the words, the door was opened, and a gentleman usher with his black rod entered the chamber, and informed the king that the Lieutenant-general Cromwell was in the audience-chamber waiting his pleasure. “Admit him forthwith, Feilding; we will receive him here,” replied the king; “and, hark you, pray Mistress Drummond to come hither, and take hence the children. We would be alone.” The usher instantly retired; and taking up his high-crowned hat which lay upon the table, without any feather, but ornamented by a diamond buckle in the band, he placed it on his head, and seated himself before a writing cabinet of ebony inlaid with ivory and silver. Scarce had he settled himself, with perhaps some slight view to effect, when the independent entered. He was uncovered, bearing his beaver in his hand, and bowed low to the fallen sovereign, though he bent not the knee, nor offered any movement to kiss hands. It was a singular and interesting meeting between two men, pitted by fortune for long years against each other, and now thrown peaceably into familiar contact. The contrast—the marked difference between the two—both great—but the one born to greatness, the other having, by the energies of his own mind, the actions of his own right hand, achieved it. Their features spoke volumes as to the distinction! The king's were, indeed, comely, and full of a calm natural majesty, but bearing no decisive marks of any ruling principle or passion— no radiancy of intellect—no manifest impress of character!—mild, though at the same time somewhat stern, their chief expression was an air of cold and melancholy resolution, not, perhaps, inconsistent with the traits of mind for which he was remarkable. When gazed upon, indeed, by one who knew him as the king, he looked it every inch; but, had he been met in a crowd, attired as a private individual, he would have been observed for nothing but the easy bearing natural to every highborn gentleman. The countenance of Cromwell, on the contrary, owed all its influence over the mind of those who saw him—and powerful, indeed, and universal was that influence—to the undoubted stamp of genius—to the indomitable resolution—the deeply-seated and unfathomable thought —the quiet but intense enthusiasm, graven in living characters upon his homely features—to the intelligence, in short, and soul that flashed out palpably from every line and lineament of his marked face. Seen in the armour of the soldier—the stateman's robe of peace—the plain garb of the every-day staid citizen—or the vile tatters of the mendicant, he could not for a second's space have remained unnoted as a superior creature—as a man of vast unquestionable powers. But if, in this respect, the carver out of his own mighty fortunes surpassed the owner of legitimate hereditary sway, in bearing and demeanour there was no comparison. Every position, every movement of the king was redolent of ease and dignity combined; and his repose—that hardest test of grace—carelessly natural and unstudied, was as perfect in its harmony and keeping as if it had been the result of the most artful skill. The motions of the independent, on the other hand, were sudden, rapid, rough; his postures rigid and iron, when erect; when seated, angular at any time and awkward, but so more obviously when brought into relief by contrast to the elegance of Charles. Both were dressed simply for their station in society, the king especially, who would have been outshone at first sight by the poorest noble of his court. He wore a plain suit of black taffeta, crossed by the broad riband of the garter, silk stockings of the same colour, with satin roses in his shoes, and a short mantle of black velvet. His sword was a plain mourning rapier, with a hilt of jet; but the deep falling collar round his neck was of the finest Brussel's point, and the star on the left side of his cloak glittered with diamonds of the purest water. His visiter, who, as he rose in dignity and station, had discarded the slovenly and coarse style of his garments, was attired handsomely in a half uniform of marone coloured cloth, faced with black velvet; a broad silk scarf of the same hue was wound in many folds about his waist, supporting his steel-hilted rapier. Military boots, highly polished and equipped with silver spurs, met his trunk hose, fashioned to match his doublet, just below the knee; and a silk hatband, with a silver clasp, relieved his dark gray beaver. “I give you good day, sir,” said Charles, in answer to the low reverence of Cromwell; “we are well pleased to see you, the rather that we owe you thanks, for that, as we have learned, by your warm intercession with the parliament, our children have been yielded to our prayers.” “Verily,” answered Cromwell, “verily, if it please your highness, I hold this matter no just cause for thanks; seeing that—as myself a father, whom the Lord hath vouchsafed to bless with a fair progeny—and as a Christian man, who, having learned that we should do to others as we would have it done to us, strives still to put in practice that which he has learned—I have but done my duty. Permit me to hope, rather, that it may be my fortune, in the time to come, in such degree to minister unto your majesty's advancement and well-being, as may deserve not your thanks only, but those of this distracted realm.” “Nevertheless, we thank you, sir,” returned Charles, with a smile seemingly sincere and natural, “both for the good which you have done to us already, and that which you profess your will to do hereafter. We will speak more at length when we shall be alone; and, in good time, here comes I 2 fair Mistress Drummond. Good Drummond”—he addressed the lady who now entered—“we will, if you be now at leisure, trespass so far upon your time as pray you to bestow your care upon these little ones. James,” he said, turning to the Duke of York, “if Sir John Berkeley be at liberty to wait on you, you have my license to ride forth; but see you be not absent over-long. Farewell, my little prattlers,” and he stooped down to kiss the rosy lips of the young princess, laying his hand softly on the sunny curls of Gloucester. “Drummond will take ye to the gardens; and, in an hour or two, ye may return to me. Farewell!—Who waits without?” he added, in a louder voice, as the lady left the chamber with the children. “Feilding, your majesty,” replied the usher, a cadet of the noble house of Denbigh. “Feilding, we would be private. What pages have ye there?” “Mildmay and Henry Gage, so please you.” “Send Mildmay to the head of the great stairs; let Gage wait at the entrance of the painted gallery, and you bestow yourself in the fourth window hence. Suffer not any one to pass the stairs, nor interrupt us upon any plea of pleasure or of business! Business,” he added, now addressing Cromwell, who had remained standing, hat in hand— “we will to business, sir, for that, I trow, has gained for me the pleasure of this visit. I pray you sit— nearer the table, if it please you;” and, drawing forth some papers from the cabinet before him, he perused them rapidly, as if in search of some peculiar passage. “Has your grace found the leisure,” Cromwell asked, “to overrun the schedule of conditions which my son-in-law, Colonel Ireton, had the honour to submit to your attention?” treat,” Cromwell replied. “I have—I do profess it to your grace—I have laboured with my whole soul and spirit, wrestling in your behalf and for your friends' advantage; and, truly, I scruple not to say it, I hold there is not one among the Presbyterian faction that will consent to a firm peace while there be any bishops in the land.” “I do believe,” said Charles, “I do, indeed, believe that you have stood my friend of late; and I do thank you for it, and, well I hope, the time shall come when I can compensate your good deeds to the full.” “Your majesty may say so, well,” Cromwell replied, impressively; “I have stood forth somewhat too boldly, so that I have—I grieve to say it, but, verily, truth must be spoken always—so that I have fallen into some suspicion even among my veteran soldiery—so that they scoff, and point at me with jeering fingers, and cry, `Lo! he, that puts his trust in princes!' Also the adjutators of the regiments have called into their counsel my son Ireton, and wrathfully entreated him, enjoining it most sternly on him that we shall hold no more communion with your highness unless some terms be settled, and that, too, right speedily.” “Indeed,” answered the king, “I had hoped that the army was disposed more loyally.” “Of a truth,” Cromwell replied, “it was so; greatly distrusting the rogue Presbyterians, and striving often and sincerely with the Lord in spirit, that it would please him to replace your majesty in the dominion and upon the throne of your forefathers; but, when you last gave audience to the adjutators—surely it is a grievous thing to say— but I profess to you, as the Lord liveth, it is true— all their trust in your highness passed away; and all the favour you had met with in their eyes, even as morning clouds when that the south wind chaseth them. Yea! and their hearts were hardened, and their countenances changed against you, and against all they deemed your friends. Moreover, secretly have I—ay, even I myself—been now advised, by letters from tried friends and otherwise, that threats are rife against me in the camp; how they would lay wait privily, and dig a pit, and set a snare before me, and take and smite me with the sword, and slay me under the cloud of night. But, as I live, they know me not who do suppose that any fear of that which man can do to me shall turn me from performing that which I have tasked my spirit to accomplish. Truly these terms, which now lie here before your majesty, with much of danger and yet more of difficulty have I prevailed upon the host to offer you. If that it seem good to you to accept them, I pledge myself right gladly that the parliament shall, ere long, consent likewise. For, lo, the army is the mightier! But if— which I trust will not be the case—you shall determine to reject them, then do I wash my hands of it. If by mine own self-sacrifice I could secure your majesty's and England's quiet, then might I, Decius-like, devote myself; but, truly, I esteem it mere insanity to rush upon mine own destruction when naught is to be gained proportionate.” “If it be so, sir,” answered Charles, after a brief pause of deliberation, “and these be the best terms your friendly aid may gain for me, I will be frank with you, and candidly accept them. Rather would I take harder terms from the blunt honesty of your stout soldiers, than chaffer for conditions, as for vile merchandise, with the cold cozening Presbyterians; and, for your own part, trust me when I say, that, next to the Almighty, with reverence be it spoken, I hold you the instrument that hath uplifted me from the abyss of sorrow, and wrought for me deliverance and restoration! And I assure you there shall be a time when you will own me grateful.” “This, then, is settled,” Cromwell replied; “I may announce unto the host your majesty's unqualified assent to these their propositions.” “You are at liberty to do so,” returned Charles; “for myself, from this hour, I hold me bound by them.” “Right joyful am I,” exclaimed Oliver; “all thanks be to the Lord of Hosts—England shall then have peace! Verily, ere ten days be passed, your majesty shall sit in state at Westminster.” “And my first deed, when there,” said Charles, “in guerdon of your much esteemed and faithful services, shall be to raise my well-beloved and trusty Cromwell to the peerage, under the title, now extinct, of Earl of Essex, and to grace him with the garter of St. George, which never yet was buckled round the knee of braver leader. The parliament, I trow, will not object to honours thus bestowed on their best general, nor to my commending him to the command of England's armies!” “Your majesty is gracious,” answered the independent, in a tone half indignation and half irony; “but, not to be made Prince of Wales, and heir to England's crown, would I thus labour that you should once more occupy the throne, did I not well believe that England's peace demands it! It is for England's laws and England's liberties—not for my personal aggrandizement—not that I should be known as lord, or earl, nor yet by any other title, which is but earthly pomp and vanity before the Lord—not that I should be the owner of broad lands or the dispenser of preferments, wielding the truncheon of the hosts of Britain—that I have done so much, and suffered; and, did I not believe your majesty resolved henceforth to hold the liberties and weal of all your subjects nearest your heart, and the fear of the Lord alway before your eyes, verily, withered be my arm and my tongue palsied if I would strike one blow or sylable one word to save you from perdition! But, now this matter is so happily arranged, may it please your grace excuse me. My duties call me hence to Windsor, where I should be by noon!” “Duty, sir, needs no license,” Charles replied, smiling most graciously, and rising from his seat, and even taking three steps toward the door, as the blunt soldier moved to leave the presence; “and, till we meet at Westminster, rest in the full assurance of possessing your liege sovereign's gratitude and favour. Ha!” he continued, as the door closed, and he found himself alone, “deep as he is, I have out-generalled him. Now he suspects not any thing. Ha! ha! the garter! and the Earl of Essex—a precious clown, in faith, to grace an earldom! But now for Lauderdale and Hollis!—the dull fools— we will out with them all, and yet reign, as our father did before us, a king in something more than name!” But the enthusiast strode forth, the tesselated floor of the proud gallery ringing beneath his massive stride, exulting and triumphant; and, as he passed the vestibule, where there were none to mark his actions, he clasped both hands above his head, and cried out in a voice husky and stifled with emotion, “My country—oh my country—have I then—have I won for thee peace, happiness, and freedom?” CHAPTER III. “Let us see— Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not: To know our enemies' minds, we'd rip their hearts; Their papers is more lawful.” King Lear. It was the third day only after Cromwell's interview with Charles that Ardenne, who had purchased a small house in the Strand, with pleasant gardens sloping to the river, making it his continual abode when not engaged in military duties, was walking on the terrace close to the water's edge, in one of those abstracted and half-melancholy moods which had become almost habitual to him, except when circumstances calling for sudden action roused him at once to all his former energy. The day had been one of storm, more like a winter's tempest than a mere summer's shower—the rain, driven along the river's course by a cold eastern gale, had fallen constantly since daybreak; and, though toward evening it had ceased, and the wind sunk, a thick chilling mist crept up the stream, at the first clinging only to the opposite shores and curtaining the distant objects, but increasing gradually in its volume, till the whole space from bank to bank was filled with a gray mass of fog, so palpable and dense that barge and wherry passed and repassed unseen, although the near dash of their oars and the loud voices of the rowers showed that they could scarcely be at ten yards distance. A transient gleam of sunshine had drawn forth Sir Edgar from his solitary studies; and, once plunged in his gloomy reveries, he continued to walk to and fro, scarce conscious of the increasing badness of the weather; but suddenly, as he paused near the little wharf to which his barge was moored, a stern voice, whose accents of command he recognised at once, rose from the misty river above the splashing of the oars which had for some time been approaching. “Ho! put in here, thou stupid knave; here, at this private stair; 'tis here we would be landed.” It was, he could not be mistaken, the voice of Cromwell; and immediately the sharp beak of a wherry ran upon the steps, pulled by two watermen, with two more men, soldiers it seemed, reclining in the stern. Oliver, for one was indeed he, leaped out forthwith, and addressed Edgar hastily, as if afraid that he should speak the first, and in a tone so loud that it was evident he wished the boatmen to hear what he said. “Is not this, I beseech you, the dwelling of brave Colonel Ardenne? We have come hither from the army—two of the adjutators—to bear tidings to him.” “It is, sir,” Edgar replied, quickly comprehending Cromwell's wish. “And I am Colonel Ardenne. I pray you walk up to the house, you and your comrade.” “Surely, most surely,” Oliver replied, with well-feigned bluntness; “we have come by the river up from Brentford, and I profess that I am chilled, and yearning for the creature comforts. How say you, Fast and Pray, think'st thou a quartern of strong waters would go down amiss? You, watermen,” he added, “make fast your boat there to the stairs, and follow us to the house; we cannot tarry here in this foul mist to pay your fares.” They were joined, while he was speaking, by the other Vol. II.—K soldier, whom, despite his dress, Ardenne at first sight discovered to be Ireton; and, although not a little wondering at their visit, and the disguise they had adopted, judging the garden no place for inquiry, he led them in all haste toward the house. Both wore coarse scarlet cassocks, with buff breeches and immense jack-boots, the uniform of privates in the ironsides off duty; long tucks, with iron scabbards, hanging from their buff belts, and clattering on the pavements as they strode along; and broad-brimmed hats of felt, the flaps unlooped, and covering their brows as if to guard against the weather. They both were furnished with tobaccopipes—short, dingy iron tubes—and smoked almost incessantly, as well to cloud their features as to afford a plausible excuse for silence; but, as a farther safeguard against inquiring cyes, Cromwell had cast about him a stained and weather-beaten dragoon cloak of frieze, with its cape muffling him wellnigh to the mouth. Ireton carried in his hand a package of some size, wrapped in an oilskin cover; and, on a casual meeting, even an intimate acquaintance would have detected nothing in their air or demeanour by which to judge them different from what they seemed. The moment they had entered—“Let your domestics instantly take arms,” said Cromwell, “and lay these watermen by the heels; they might blab else, although I think they know us not; and let your trusty steward alone attend us; and bid him see your doors be locked, and that no one of your attendants, on any pretext, this night cross the threshold.” Leading his guests himself into a small library refired from the street and looking out upon the garden, Edgar went out to give his orders. Before returning he had seen the boatmen, after a slight struggle, secured in a remote chamber, with an abundance of strong liquors, which he judged rightly would at once console them and effectually close their mouths, and two stout watchmen posted at the door—had given his directions to old Anthony, who, since Sir Henry's death, followed his fortunes —and held the keys of every door and shutter in his own possession. “Rude greeting, this,” said Oliver, as he returned; “but, of a truth, there is deep need of it. In brief, I will acquaint you with the matter, for time presses. Three days since Charles accepted fully the conditions of the army, as I wrote you on Monday! The adjutators are brought over! the parliament must come to our terms! So far all's well! But, with the dawn to-day, a letter came to me at Windsor—from one who has conveyed us much intelligence, and never has deceived us—a friend in the king's bedchamber—verbum sat! He writes us that Charles Stuart hath been all yesterday in deep debate with Ashburnham, that firebrand of the queen's—that their resolves are taken —and a letter—of a surety in cipher, but, then, we hold the key, the Lord be thankful for it—prepared for Henrietta, to be conveyed right cunningly this night to Dover by an unconscious messenger. What the contents may be our friend might not discover, though, as he writes, he left no stone unturned; but of this he is certain, that it is all-important, and decisive of the king's intention as to the pending treaty. This letter we must intercept; and, therefore, we rode straight in this disguise to Brentford, and thence took boat, to baffle prying eyes; and, so far, all goes rightly. Now attend— the bearer of this letter will come at ten o'clock tonight, carrying a saddle on his head, to the Blue Boar in Holborn, thence to take horse for Dover. The man will wear a green plush riding-coat, and breeches of the same; the elbows of the doublet and the seams of the trunk-hose guarded with neat-skin leather; a stammel waistcoat, and a red riband round his hat, which is of common straw. The saddle will be old, and somewhat patched and ragged; and, in the off-side lap, between the tree and pannel, the letter is concealed. The man knows not that it is there, deeming he goes to buy a famous hunting-horse from one John Styles, a horse courser. He is to put up at the Red Lion inn in Dover; and there will be one, knowing his description, who shall search the saddle and—find nothing! for we must have the packet! How goes the night, Sir Edgar?” “Past seven, I am sure; nay,” after looking at his watch, “but it lacks scant a quarter of an hour to eight. I thought not that it was so late!” “Nay, then, we are but just in time; you will go with us, sir, and aid us. We must have three, and know none else in whom we may so perfectly rely. You are aware that Charles is on parole not to hold secret interview with France—his parole broken, there is no breach of honesty or honour in seizing and perusing his despatches. That package—open it quickly, Ireton—contains a dress like these that we now wear—the uniform of one who hath about your inches, borrowed for the nonce. It savours somewhat of tobacco-smoke and stale October, but we must not be nice. I pray you don it speedily. Nay, Ireton, you forget; where is the net to gather up his lovelocks, and the peruke? quick! quick!” he cried, impatiently binding up Edgar's flowing hair, and covering it with a foxy wig, close-clipped, and cut into a hundred little peaks, like those which Cleaveland mentions in his Hue and Cry, deriding them as `Hair in characters and luggs in text.' ” Some pigment was laid on his eyebrows, whiskers, and mustaches, suiting them to the colour of his false hair. A kerchief of coarse cotton next replaced his collar of fine lace, and a garb similar to that of his companions his well-fancied habits. A clumsy broadsword was produced, with a wide leathern shoulder-belt, from under Cromwell's cloak; and this, with an old pair of his own military boots, carefully soiled for the occasion, and fitted with rough iron spurs, and an unpolished headpiece, completed his attire. “Mind, now, your bearing,” Cromwell said, as they left the house; “smoke without ceasing; jostle a little those whom we meet with in the streets, and quote the strongest texts you may remember. When that we reach the inn, the great gate will be closed, the wicket only open. We will all enter in, and drink till half past nine of the clock—then go forth you, as if upon some errand —loiter about the gate until you see our man—follow in after him, and, when he passeth up the yard —for he will go directly to the stables—bar instantly the wicket, and advise us! Now let us move on somewhat smartly.” Without more words, they took their way across the town toward Holborn, through quarters which, though now the very heart and the most populous portion of the giant city, were then but sparsely built upon, with frequent gardens intervening between the scattered tenements, and miry lanes, unlighted and ill paved, instead of regular streets. The night continued dark, and so unpleasant that, when they reached at length the mighty thoroughfare of Holborn, the street was half deserted and nearly silent. Smoking much as they passed along, and speaking little, they reached the well-known hostelry. Its gate, as Cromwell had foreseen, K 2 was closed and locked; but a low wicket door gave ingress to the yard, a long irregular space, surrounded on three sides by the rambling buildings of the inn, with three tiers, one above the other, of open galleries, through which was the access to the chambers, and bounded at the end by a long range of granaries and pack-stables. The yard was nearly dark—for but one lamp shone dimly over the entrance of the public room, just at the left hand of the gateway as they entered; and, except the lanterns of the hostlers flitting about the farther buildings, no other lights were visible within; but, as if to make up for the deficiency, a large glass lamp on either side the gateway rendered the street in front of it as light as day. Abruptly entering the taproom, in which some four or five grave-looking citizens were comforting themselves, after the business of the day, with poached eggs and canary, buttered ale, burnt sack, and half a dozen other drinks and dishes fashionable in those days, but long ago forgotten— “Ho! landlord!” shouted Cromwell, “bring us three cans of your best double ale—good measure, and be quick about it! Surely, my flesh doth thirst for a cool drink, even as the faint spirit thirsteth for a soul-searching exposition of the mysteries that be essential to salvation.” “Such as Lieutenant Profit-by-the-word poured forth to our great edifying yester even,” Ireton answered; “verily, good man, he was upheld most marvellously—four hours did he hold forth steadily, not waxing faint in flesh nor weary in well-doing, but borne along in spirit with exceeding fervour, and his voice ringing like a trumpet, louder at every close. Truly, a second Boanerges.” “Ay! and he touched with the true unction on that hard rock that splits all weaker vessels, the full justification of the soul by faith—the utter needlessness of works to save, when that the soul is filled—ay, as a tankard that doth overflow its brim—and lo! my can is out. Ho! tapster, fill us the good black gallon jack, and fetch us more tobacco—or as a milldam that doth burst its banks —with the true grace of God!” “Yea!” answered Ireton, “yea! verily he did; but I bethought me somewhat that he o'ershot the mark when he did undertake to prove that those who have been once in grace may never relapse into sin, and that unto the pure all things are pure and holy.” “Why, you must be an infidel,” returned the other; “what, know you not that vice and virtue be but names—not of aught tangible or real—not of things that exist without the body—but of mere fantasies, abstractions whose seat is the mind. Surely it is the spirit in which a thing is done, and not the thing itself, that makes the virtue or the vice. Lo! when you slay a man in hand to hand encounter, fighting, it may be, in the deadly breach, or riding on the cannon's mouth, truly it is imputed not as an act of sin, but an heroical and manly deed of glory—as when strong Samson killed his thousands—ay, or, yet more to the point, when Heber's wife the Kenite smote Sisera within the tent and slew him, though a suppliant and guest; but had she driven in that selfsame nail to satisfy vile lust of gain or murtherous revenge, then had it been guilt in her—shame while on earth and infamy— and, though we should not judge—judgment hereafter and perdition. Thus, in the soul is the distinction; it maketh its own righteouness, it maketh its own sin! All that is done for virtue becomes virtue. To whom all things seem pure, verily, all are pure! Yea, if a man have the grace given passed by him near a lighted shop; he suffered him to get some dozen paces in advance, and then, with a slow sauntering gait, pursued him. He saw him stoop beneath the wicket, and, without looking to the right or left, walk up the yard toward a group of hostlers playing at odd or even on a horseblock round a dingy lantern. Silently and unseen he dropped the bar across the wicket, and looked into the taproom. “Tarry,” said Cromwell, “tarry yet a while— the bird is ours!” In a few minutes the sound of a horse's hoofs were heard upon the pavement. “Now, then,” cried Oliver, “now!” and, instantly unsheathing his long tuck, he darted through the doorway, followed immediately by Ireton and Sir Edgar, likewise with drawn swords. Cromwell had reached the man before they overtook him; but Ardenne heard him say, “You ride forth late, my friend, but we be placed here in the name and by the orders of the parliament to search all goers out. But, verily, thou lookest like an honest lad. Thou hast, I warrant me, nothing that thou wouldst care to hide!” “Not I, i'faith,” replied the stranger, bluntly; “search away, Master Soldier, if such be your orders, but I pray you delay me not, because I am in haste.” “Lead the man's horse into the stable, Fast and Pray,” said Cromwell, glancing his eyes toward Ireton, “'twere shame to let the dumb beast stand here in the pelting rain; and thou, good Win-the-fight, come in with us. Verily, friend, we will not long detain thee—but a horn of ale will not harm thee this dark night, I trow.” “Not it, not it!” replied the fellow; “what would you have now?” “Oh! turn thy pockets out. Surely we will not be too hard with thee. Well! well! this is a purse—good lack, a heavy one!—`to this a letter —`to Master Styles, horse courser, Dover!' Look sharp that he be not too deep for thee, this John Styles — he played our Colonel Whalley a foul trick with a spavened jade some two years past. He is a keen blade. Well! this is a pipe—and this a bacca-box—so! so!—in these there is no treason. Truly, I said thou wert an honest fellow; and I was not deceived. Another cup of ale? Tush, never mince the matter, 'twill warm thee more than thy plush jerkin. Upseys! So! down with it like lamb's-wool. Well—thou mayst go now, so thou wilt not tarry and have a rouse with us. Ho! Fast and Pray, bring out the worthy fellow's horse; he is not such as we be sent to look for, and—now I think of it—our time of watch is ended!” A quick glance interchanged with his son-in-law assured the general that the letter was secured; so, slapping the messenger upon the back, he bade him mount, and God go with him; and as he rode away, unconscious that his journey was now useless, the three companions hurried to Ardenne's house, where they might profit by their prize in safety. A short half hour's walk placed them before his door—so quickly, goaded to their utmost speed by anxious curiosity, did they retrace their steps. Lights were set in the library, the curtains closely drawn, the door locked, and then Ireton produced the packet; it was a small despatch, and fastened with a plain flaxen cord and ordinary seal, addressed to “Master Ephraim Mackleworth”—evidently a feigned name—“at the Red Lion, Dover.” Within this was a small letter, simply directed to H. M. R., bound with a skein of white floss silk, and fastened with the impression of a finely-cut antique upon green wax. Oliver caught it with an impatient gesture from the hand of Ireton, broke the seal, cast his eyes hastily upon it, and exclaiming, “Nay, it is not in cipher,” read thus aloud:— “Dearest and best Marie— “I have received your kind and most consoling letter of July from the tried friend who bore it. The wisdom of your counsels I acknowledge, and, so far as in me lies, will follow them. But, trust me, girl, better and brighter days are yet in store for us. I do assure you I am even now more king —more powerful and free—than ere I raised my standard; so that I doubt not, with a little patience and a small share of finesse, all shall be yet as we would have it. I am now courted by all parties— English and Scottish—Presbyterians, Independents —parliament and army—all prostrate at my feet— all rivals for my favour, and balanced, too, so equally, that whom I join soever carries the day. In truth, chiefly do I incline toward the Scots, but, for the present, seem, for my own purposes, to favour more the army. In the end, whosoe bids the highest has me. You disapprove, you tell me, my `promising so much to those two villains, Ireton and Cromwell.' Now, I beseech you, be not alarmed nor troubled; but leave me to manage, who am informed far better of all circumstances than you by any means can be; and on this head rest altogether easy, for in due season I shall know how to deal with these rogues, who, for a silken garter, shall be fitted with a hempen rope! This by a mode that can by no chance fail; where, fore, though briefly—as my space compels—I yet write plainly. If all things prosper with me, as I have now good cause to deem they will—for all the factions, themselves cozened, look on the others as outwitted—I shall once more embrace the well-beloved queen and mistress of my heart, greater and far more powerful than ever, ere many months shall pass, in our own palace of Whitehall. “Until the Lord, in his good time, shall bring which things to pass, “Your loving husband and idolater, “C. R.” With a calm voice, though bitter in the extreme and scornful, Cromwell read out this document. Ireton's eye flashed fire, and, as his father-in-law ended, he violently dashed his hand upon the table— “Whose dogs are we,” he cried, in fierce and ringing tones, “that we should be thus scandalously dealt with? As the Lord liveth he shall die the death!” “But three days since,” said Cromwell, “hypocrite that he is, base knave, and liar, he proclaimed, through me, his full acceptance of the army's terms —his last words were, `and for myself henceforth I hold me bound by them!' and I, fool that I was, I did rejoice, and triumphed in my heart that England should have peace! and now—he will hang both of us! ay, HANG! Can there be any trust in such a man?” “None!” answered Edgar, mournfully, “there can indeed be none! It is long since I have even dreamed there could! He is unstable as the sands of the seashore, and false—as fortune!” “Alas! alas! for England!” Oliver exclaimed, in deep impressive tones. “If it be thy will, mighty Lord, that this thy servant be a prey and victim to this man of Belial, truly I am prepared. But for this goodly and regenerate land, for this oppressed and miserable people, in whose behalf already many times thou hast displayed the wonders of thy might—the miracles of thine invincible right hand—not for myself—not for myself, oh Lord, poor sinner that I am and leaky vessel, do I presume now to remonstrate—to strive earnestly —to wrestle, as did Jacob in the dark—against thy great decrees—but for this lovely isle—this precious England!” “With Caiaphas I say,” returned the fiery Ireton, “with Caiaphas! Jew though he was, unrighteous judge, and murtherer of the Lord's anointed! `Ye know not'—'tis to you I say it, my friends and fellow-soldiers—`nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not!”' This bold speech for that night ended the debate. Cromwell was silent—though the remarkable and resolute compression of his mouth, and the deep frown that furrowed his high forehead, and the determined gleam of his hard eye, showed that his silence was produced by any thing rather than doubt or fear—and Ardenne, at this last and heaviest blow, was, for the moment, wholly overcome! He saw the certain peril, the imminent and overwhelming ruin, but he saw neither refuge nor escape. He felt that, while Charles lived, England could never be at rest; but he did not feel that his death would give her that repose which she desired now more almost than liberty. In gloom that evening they had met—in deeper gloom they parted—save Ireton alone, who seemed elate and almost joyous; for, fraught with a sincere unselfish patriotism that would not have disgraced an ancient Roman—a wild and daring theorist—a confident and bold believer in the perfectibility of man and in the supreme excellence of Vol. II.—L democratic forms—he fancied that he now foresaw the advent of his dearest wishes—the overthrow of monarchy and aristocracy for ever—the birth of a seagirt republic—the creation of a British state, unequalled in the annals of the world! more wise and eloquent than the free Athens!—in morals more severe than Sparta!—in grace more elegant than Corinth!—in empire, arms, and glory more magnificent than Rome! CHAPTER IV. “I have advertised him by secret means, That if, about this hour, he make this way, Under the colour of his usual game, He shall here find his friends, with horse and men, To set him free from his captivity.” King Henry VI. Sadly and wearily the year wore onward; the golden days of summer were already passed; the leaves, which had so greenly flourished a few weeks before, grew sere like human hopes, and were whirled wildly from their hold by each succeeding blast. Autumn had waned already into winter; yet still the leaders of the army, after their seizure of the fatal letter, which necessarily ruined the king's cause, remained inactive, as it seemed, at Windsor, but, in truth, hushed in grim repose, and waiting the maturity of those events which they foresaw distinctly, and expected with a stern and vengeful pleasure. Meantime the privates became every day more restless and ungovernable. Distrusting their own officers while they held daily Intercourse with the king's friends, now that they had withdrawn themselves from all communication, they imagined not that the correspondence was indeed at an end, but that some scheme had been determined to the exclusion and betrayal of their interests, and raved accordingly in their religious and political assemblies with equal fury against the carnal-minded parliament and the grandees, as they now termed their own superior officers. The regiment of Ardenne was perhaps the only one of the whole army which had entirely resisted this contagion; for having taken arms—many from personal attachment to their young leader, whose neighbours or whose tenants a great portion of the soldiers were—many from a sense of political oppression, but none from any feeling of fanaticism or religious fury—the most part being of the Episcopal persuasion—they looked on unconcerned, while their companions were indulging in the loudest tumults, and reposed all their trust in the high talents and integrity of their commander. Often times since the memorable evening of the intercepted letter Cromwell and Ardenne had debated on the next step to be taken, and on the future prospects of their country; and both had often and again grieved at their inability to shape out any course by which they might hope confidently to eschew the breakers which they could see directly in their track. Both clearly saw that the king's union with the Presbyterians could but be the beginning of a worse tyranny, both in the church and state, than that which they had overthrown; and both saw likewise that with these, rather than with the army, he would assuredly at last make common cause. Cromwell, in this dilemma, hinted, rather than openly declared, his own opinion, founded in part upon the evident determination of the army, that the king should be brought to trial, and, if found guilty, suffered to reap the harvest of his perjury, dissimulation, and oppression; yet, while maintaining both the policy and justice of the measure, he was still at a loss to say what plan should be adopted for the future government of England, thus to be left without a head. Avowing himself favourable to a mixed form, composed, as heretofore, of three estates, with the executive department vested in one officer of ample powers though limited, he yet could point out none on whom the choice could fall with safety and propriety. Sir Edgar, on the other hand--acknowledging the perfect justice, doubted the policy of the king's execution — thinking that wilder anarchy would follow at the first, and ultimately either the Presbyterian influence, which they now chiefly feared, prevail, or one strong-handed military tyrant rise from the chaos of licentious freedom. Ireton, in the mean time, the leader of a powerful faction, declared at all times his desire for a republic, founded upon a general franchise of the whole people; and Harrison, who represented a yet more fanatical and phrensied party, calling themselves fifth-monarchists, looked forward to the near approach of the millennium, and, arrogating to themselves an absolute perfection, claimed an equality of rights, of power, and of property for all men; but all alike agreed on the expedience of awaiting the recurrence of some overt action on the part of Charles or of the Presbyterians. For this they had not, indeed, long to tarry; for, on the morning of the twelfth day of November, the gentlemen whose office was to wait upon his chamber found that the king was not there, and his bed had not been used that night. Three letters in his own handwriting lay upon the table; two to the parliament, one to the speaker of each house, and a third to the General Fairfax. After the first excitement had subsided, it was discovered that Sir John Berkeley, Legg, and Ashburnham were missing; and the hoof marks of four horses were traced readily in the moist ground close to the postern of the garden, into which there was a private passage from the chamber of the king. In none of the three letters was it stated whither he had fled, but simply that he had found it needful to withdraw himself, in consequence, as he was well assured, of plots existing for his assassination, and that he should hold himself concealed until some settlement was made for the well-governance and quiet of the kingdom. The news of this escape produced the greatest tribulation in the houses. It was believed, and generally dreaded, that the king was in hiding somewhere within the city; that the Presbyterian party and the royalists had privily united, and that a sudden rising would ensue, and massacre of all opposed to it. An act passed instantly, prohibiting, on pain of death and confiscation, any from harbouring the king without conveying notice to the parliament. Expresses were sent off to every seaport town, laying a strict embargo on all vessels; and every person who had fought on the king's side in the late wars was banished from the city, and any other place within a circuit of ten miles round London. Meanwhile the hapless monarch, having ridden day and night toward the southwestern coast, frustrated, by the mismanagement, or, as some say, the treachery of Ashburnham, in his desire of taking ship from the New Forest, sought refuge for a space at Titchfield House in Hampshire; and, finally, with an incomprehonsible degree of folly, surrendered himself to Hammond, a strict friend of Cromwell, governor of the Isle of Wight. It was the second day after the flight of Charles, his unalterable hatred and contempt of parliament had led him peremptorily to refuse. On the fifteenth of the same month, a statement of the king's escape, his present secure situation, and the propositions tendered to him by the parliament, was sent down to the army, with a remonstrance ably penned by Fairfax, refuting the strong calumnies which had been cast against the principal commanders, and setting forth the motives of their conduct. Armed with this potent document, Cromwell, as the most firm, and, at the same time, best-beloved of all the officers, was selected to this perilous but honourable duty; and, taking with him Ardenne's well-disciplined and trusty regiment, without delay or hesitation he repaired to Ware—at that time the headquarters of some five or six thousand soldiers at the least, who, stimulated by their adjutators, and believing that the flight of Charles was preconcerted and connived at by the grandees of the host, were in state of turbulence bordering closely upon actual mutiny. It was about eleven of the clock on a bright frosty morning that Cromwell, with his small lifeguard, reached Ware. Causing his trumpets to sound through the streets, he summoned all the regiments to get themselves together orderly upon the green, to hear a proclamation from the lord-general; and, ere this summons had been well delivered, they turned out, not, indeed, orderly or in good discipline, but in loud and tumultuous disarray. They were all under arms, although expressly contrary to orders; two regiments especially of musketeers, who had their caps adorned with ribands, inscribed, as a motto of insubordination, with the words “For the people's freedom and the soldiers' right!” were observed to be in full field order, with their bandoleers slung round them, and the matches of their arquebuses lighted. Among these, as Cromwell advanced slowly toward them, accompanied by Ardenne only, and followed at a little distance by a dismounted captain's guard with drawn swords, but no firearms—the remainder of the regiment halting in line a little farther in the rear—a wild disorganizing shout arose, “Equality of rights! equality of rights! No king! no coalition! Down with the false grandees!” But when, with his long sturdy strides, and his stern features perfectly calm, but resolute and hard as if they had been cast in iron, he had closed with them, the shouts ceased suddenly. Slowly he walked along their front, looking each private full and firmly in the eye; and few were there who dared to meet with an unblenching brow his concentrated glare of anger and defiance. Halting at length directly opposite to the two regiments of musketeers, he drew out the proclamation. “I have a paper here,” he said, “to read to ye from the lord-general. Not to mutineers, however, but to soldiers was I sent! Extinguish instantly,” he added, in a tone somewhat louder, yet so severe and passionless that one battalion obeyed on the moment, “those matches! How dare ye muster thus? Out of your caps with those unsoldierly and villain mottoes—out with them! Nay! but ye shall trample them beneath your feet!” and, awed by his immoveable determination, the same battalion once again complied; while the great bulk of that tumultuous assembly looked on in abashed wonder, and, ordering as rapidly as possible their unmilitary and ill-dressed front, assumed an air of perfect discipline and a right soldierly demeanour. Not so the second regiment; for, brandishing their arms aloft, they raised a deep and scornful murmur, increasing gradually into a shout of absolute defiance. Nay, some brought down their arquebuses to the ready movement, and even cocked them; but not one man removed the motto of rebellion. It was a moment of anxiety, if not of real peril; for, though the great mass of the men were quiet, they yet wore an air of sullen and almost savage discontent, which clearly showed their temper, and made it but too probable than any overt action, of one troop even, would kindle the whole body into a sudden blaze of fury. “Heard ye not,” Oliver proceeded, in a voice pitched several notes below his usual key, but so full of intense resolve, of quiet but indomitable spirit, that it thrilled to the hearts of all who heard it, even of those who still resisted, “or do ye dare to disobey me? You, sir,” he continued, stepping close up to the ranks, which now began to waver somewhat, and confronting a gigantic lance-pesade, “ground your arms!” and the man, overawed by his demeanour, slowly and sulkily obeyed. “Shame! shame!” cried several voices from the rear; “thou braggart, that wouldst do so much, to shrink at the first word!” “Silence there in the ranks!” Oliver cried, fiercely, and at his word again the murmurs ceased; but, brief and trivial as they were, these murmurs had yet roused anew a spirit of resistance in the bosom of the half-terrified ringleader. Silent he stood indeed, but his mouth worked convulsively, a red flush overspread his countenance, and his hand quivered as it grasped the barrel of his musket. “Soh! thou art then a soldier,” continued Cromwell, once more confronting the delinquent. “Now, then, pull forth that rascal riband from thy cap! Cast it, I say, into the dust, and set thy foot upon it!” The man spoke not, but bit his lip till the blood spirted forth, moving, however, no limb or muscle of his body, whether to execute or to resist his officer's command. “Do as I bid thee, dog!” and, with a flash of furious and ungovernable ire lighting up every feature of his face, Cromwell stamped his heel on the turf as though he was in act of trampling down a living foeman. “No dog of thine, at least,” answered the fellow; “though, if thou hadst the will, all Englishmen would be as slaves and dogs beneath thee.” “Ha! this to me!” and, seizing the gigantic trooper by the throat, he shook him to and fro as though he were an infant, and cast him, almost, as it seemed, without an effort, to the earth behind him. “Seize him, guards, ho! Ye answer for him with your lives. He is a ringleader; and, as the Lord of earth and heaven liveth, verily he shall die the death!” and, as he spoke, his handful of assistants dragged off the prisoner, struggling and shouting for a rescue, and placed him in security among their mounted comrades. But, quickly as they did his bidding, yet quicker was the movement of the captive's right-hand man to succour or avenge him, who, at the very point of time when Cromwell seized the lance-pesade, levelled his arquebuse right at his head within six feet. Ardenne dashed forward sword in hand followed by six or eight of his most active men, while his lieutenant shouted to the horsemen in the rear to charge! Yet, had their aid been needed, the career of Oliver had been concluded on that day in a poor paltry riot— but it was needed not! for, in the very act of capturing the one, that keen-eyed and quick-witted leader observed the motion of the other mutineer! Before the heavy din, with which the armour of the first clanged as he fell, was ended, his broad sword gleamed aloft in the bright sunshine—down it came whistling through the air—down, like a flash of lightning, and, with his scull cleft through his headpiece to the chin, the second plunged head foremost, a dead man ere he touched the earth, his arquebuse discharged, though harmlessly, by the convulsed and quivering fingers after the life had left the body. He paused not for a second's space to suffer them to rafly or recover from the consternation which had fallen on them with all the chilling influence of a panic terror, but, “Charge!” he shouted, in a voice of thunder, “charge the rebellious dogs. Kill! kill! spare none who dare resist!” and, with the word, Ardenne rushed in, and faithfully his gallant men requited the trust placed in their allegiance. Firmly, as though they had outnumbered their opponents, that little handful dashed into the breach which Cromwell's energy had made already in the rebellious ranks; and at a full trot, with their rapiers levelled to the charge, up swept the horsemen. But the fall of their ringleaders, and the undaunted bearing of their officers, were too much for their nerves; and, ere the guard was on them, their musket-buts rang heavily as they were grounded simultaneously, and the obnoxious badges, torn with quick hands from every headpiece, fluttered on all sides in the air, or strewed the turf before their feet. “Halt! ho! halt, Colonel Ardenne!” shouted Oliver, perceiving instantly and profiting by his advantage; but scarcely was his second cry in time; for, though they curbed their chargers as the word reached their ears, the cavalry stopped not until their horses chests were close upon the wavering ranks, and their long rapiers waving over their heads. “Draw off your horse, Lieutcnant Winthrop,” he continued; “advance six files dismounted—arrest each those, of whom one certainly was destined to be sent from the fair face of the bright laughing earth, unhouselled and unshriven, into the presence of his Maker, with scarce a moment even to prepare the spirit for endurance of the fearful shock which should disjoin it from the body! The lottery of death was ended! The soldier, whose hard fate had been thus chance-decided, was a small, delicate, pale-looking man; of a weak frame, and a countenance effeminate and betokening any thing save energy of mind or resolution. Yet was this frail and nerveless being perfectly cool and self-collected; while his companion — taken in the very fact— limbed like a Hercules, with high bold features and a brilliant eye—a man who would have ridden fearlessly, although alone, upon a stand of levelled pikes, or rushed upon a cannon's mouth just as the linstock was applied—shook like an aspen leaf through all his powerful frame; his brow, his cheek, his lip, grew white as ashes—his eye was dim and senseless—he sobbed, he wept aloud, struggling violently with the troopers who conducted him to his last stand on earth, and yelling phrensiedly for mercy. With an air perfectly composed and fearless, the other threw aside his cassock and his vest, unbound the kerchief from his neck, giving it as a token to a favourite fellow-soldier, and having, in a clear, unfaltering voice, confessed the justice of his sentence, and exhorted his companions to take warning from his fate, he bowed respectfully to those who had condemned him, and stepped as lightly to the place of execution as though it were his choice to die. There they stood, side by side—full of strong health, and intellect, and life, and passion, in one short moment to be mere clods of soulless and unconscious clay—and there, with their death-weapons levelled, Vol. II.—M paler themselves and far more agitated than even those on whom they were to do the work of blood, the firing party, chosen from the ranks of the same regiment—composed, perhaps, of messmates, of familiar friends, of proved associates in many a scene of peril and of glery—perhaps of comrades, plotters, instigators to the very crime which they were destined to avenge, their friends to expiate— their partners, without doubt, in this last fatal deed of guilt, and now their executioners! The regiments were drawn up forming three sides of a great hollow square, the criminals upon the fourth, the executioners already facing them at scarce ten paces distant. There was not a voice—a sigh—a movement in that mighty concourse; not a weapon clashed, not a foot rustled on the earth. But the sun shone in glorious beauty upon the burnished pike-heads and the waving standards; and the whole earth looked gay and smiling—more gay, more smiling, as it seemed to the poor criminals, than ever it had been before. A short extemporaneous prayer was uttered by the captain of their own battalion; a sad and doleful hymn was chanted by the now penitent and terrified assemblage, with a sound inexpressibly and strangely mournful. The fatal sign was given!—a bright flash, and a sharp report as of a single piece!—and, when the smoke cleared off, there lay the bodies on the sod, lifeless and motionless, their sins and sorrows thus simultaneously and suddenly concluded. There was no need of more severity—and the quick eye of Cromwell saw it. With the yet warm and palpitating bodies in full view, he read aloud the general's message, the soldiery listening to every word with a respectful and sincere attention, that denoted all the force of the example they had witnessed. As he concluded, every regiment presented, and then grounded arms; the adjutators humbly advanced from the crestfallen ranks, and with a deferential air expressed their complete satisfaction at the lord-general's exposition, their sense of their own past misconduct, and their gratitude to Cromwell for the mercy he had shown them, in taking but two lives where all so righteously were forfeit. After a few more words of reprimand, blended with commendations of their former services, and exhortations never to offend in the like sort hereafter, Oliver, whose point was amply gained, dismissed the soldiers; and the bands striking up in the impressive notes of a dead march, with colours trailed and arms reversed, they filed off to their several quarters, well convinced now that, howsoever their commanders might connive at disobedience to the parliament, they would in no sort tolerate or wink at the most trivial mutiny against their own authority. In fact, by his undaunted resolution in suppressing, and his inflexible severity in punishing the present disaffection, joined to the partial lenity he had extended to his prisoners, Cromwell had more than regained all that he had temporarily lost in the opinions of the army. Never, perhaps, at any previous time had he stood higher in power, or possessed more fully the respect and admiration, not unmixed with wholesome fear, of those whom he commanded, than at the present moment. The next night, in the most magnificent of England's palaces, in the great hall of Windsor Castle, the officers of that victorious army, which had not merely conquered but annihilated the high faction of the cavaliers, defeated the intrigues of the Scotch Presbyterians, seen through and cut asunder—if they had not disentangled—the gordian knot of parliamentary chicane, assembled in most solemn but most secret council. There, actuated by a single spirit, and speaking, as it were, all with one common voice—which they asserted, and perhaps believed, such is the force of the heart's self-deception, to be a direct proof that HE, whom they had sought so long in prayer, earnestly dealing with him that he should let that cup pass from them, had put the counsel by immediate inspiration into their hearts—those stern religionists determined that, as a traitor, murderer, and tyrant, Charles Stuart should be arraigned, and brought to answer for his deeds before the high court of the nation in parliament assembled. It was remarked even then, and deeply pondered on in after days, as something singular and strange, by Ardenne, who was not present at the council, having remained in London on his return from Ware, but who was instantly apprized of the proceedings—that, neither before that assemblage, nor publicly at any other time, did Oliver urge on or advocate, with his accustomed fervour, the measure which, as Sir Edgar knew full well, he had long since determined on within his secret heart. It seemed as though he did not choose himself to stir at all in that which had been mooted by the common soldiery in the first instance, and advanced by insubordination verging on open mutiny; or, perhaps, seeing that, without his personal co-operation in the matter, all things were tending to the result which he believed the best, he was content to lend them the mere negative support afforded by his presence at deliberations, which he did not oppose or hinder, wisely reserving his great energies for the accomplishment of those great ends which could not be wrought to maturity without them; and holding himself, like the gods of the Grecian drama, aloof from matters which afforded no due scope for his unconquerable powers—from plots which could as well be disentangled and wound smoothly cut by those who had, perhaps, imbibed his own opinions, and were unconsciously—while fancying themselves free and untrammelied agents —the mere tools and instruments of his superior intellect. CHAPTER V. “Let us be sacriticers, but not butchers, Caius. We all stand up against the spirit of Cæsar, And in the spirit of men there is no blood; Oh that we, then, could come by Cæsar's spirit, And not dismember Cæsar. But, alas! Cæsar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends, Let's kill him holdly, but not wrathfully. Let's calve him as a dish fit for the gods, Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.” Julius Cæsar. The indignation of the parliament, who, after the retreat of the eleven impeached members, had more and more come into the strong measures of the army, was fearfully inflamed by the king's absolute refusal of the four acts; so much so that a bill was passed forbidding all addresses for the future to Charles Stuart, and all renewal of negotiations with him for a settlement, though not till after two or three debates, in which the military leaders, and, above all, the lieutenant-general, took active part. The last, indeed, on one occasion, ended a long and strenuous harangue by raising his voice to its highest pitch with these emphatic words, “Teach not the army, by neglecting your own safety and that of the kingdom, by which theirs also is involved, to M 2 deem themselves betrayed, and their best interests abandoned to the rage of an irreconcilable enemy, whom, for your sake, they have dared to provoke. Beware”—and, as he spoke, he laid his hand upon his rapier's hilt—“beware, lest their despair cause them to seek safety by some other means than by adhering to you, who know not to consult for your own safety.” And now, although the peril from the army's insubordination had subsided, not a day passed without some riotous commotion indicative of the divided state of public feeling. Continual tumults between the London mob, now become once more loyal to the king, and the detachments of the veterans quartered in the metropolis, were not suppressed without some bloodshed; and, in the early spring, were followed by a general movement of the royalists throughout the kingdom, which, had it been planned with as much of concert and of wisdom as it was executed with high bravery and spirit, would have caused much perplexity to those in power. As it was, however, so ill-timed and unpremediated were the risings of the cavaliers, that they were easily subdued in detail, although their numbers, if united, would have been truly formidable, and although they fought, as individual bodies, with all the resolution of despair, and in no case were vanquished without loss and difficulty by the independent army. The men of Kent were beaten, after a hard-fought and well-disputed battle, at Maidstone, by the lord-general in person— the royalists of Wales, under the gallant Colonel Poyer, were defeated, and Pembroke, into which they had retired, taken by Cromwell after a six weeks' siege. This exploit over, that indefatigable leader hurried northward with all his wonted energy of movement, came on the Scottish army, now united with the northern cavaliers of Langdale, at Preston on the Ribbic; and, though with forces vastly inferior, hesitated not to give them battle. Having defeated them so utterly that their army was, in truth, wholly disorganized and scattered, he pursued them closely into Scotland, where he compelled the citizens of Edinburgh, deeply averse and hostile to his party, to put down the royalists, and to replace the power of the state in Argyle's hands, who had now joined the independent faction with his whole heart and spirit. While there, the Earl of Leven and Sir David Lesley so totally disclaimed the covenant as to cannonade the royalist troops from the castle, and to agree, at a convention held in my Lady Home's house in the Cannongate, with Oliver, that there was a necessity, now fully obvious, for taking the king's life. Meanwhile Lord Goring, who had advanced to Black-heath, hoping that by his presence London would be encouraged into action, being checked by Fairfax, shut himself up in Colchester; but, after a long and vigorous defence, was forced, when all was over, to surrender at discretion; and had the farther misery of seeing two of his bravest officers, Sir George Liste and Sir Charles Lucas, shot by the conquerors as rebels—a rigorous and cruel exercise of power, for which the general did not escape much obloquy, although it was alleged in his defence, and probably with truth, that he was instigated to such unwonted harshness solely by the suggestions of the fierce and unrelenting Ireton. This absolute suppression of the king's friends by land was poorly compeusated by the defection of the navy; Rainsborough, its commander for the parliament, having been set on shore by his rebellious crews, who bore away for Holland, and, casting anchor at the Brill, after a short time took on board the Prince of Wales, accompanied by Rupert, as their admiral; not in compliance with the wishes of the queen, who would have lavished that high dignity on her unworthy paramour Lord Jermyn. About the same time the young Duke of York, afterward James the Second, by the assistance and the skill of Colonel Bamfield, made good his flight from London, and reached the Netherlands in safety. And now, beyond all doubt, was the atrocious infidelity and wickedness of Henrietta proved, who—although the revolted fleet had full and undisputed mastery of the channel, and might, with ease and certainty, have forcibly delivered Charles from the hard durance in which he was now held, after an unsuccessful effort to break forth at Carisbrook—prevailed upon the Prince of Wales to waste his time in frivolous and uscless enterprises up the Thames and on the coasts, until the parliament had fitted out another fleet under the Earl of Warwiek, when, after what a scaman would term lubberly manœuvring, he sailed toward Holland, closely pursued by Warwiek's navy, and never performed any action serviceable to his unhappy father's cause or creditable to his own fame. During the progress of the futile struggle, which had terminated in rendering obvious to all the hopelessness of any effort at armed interposition for the king, the parliament, while Cromwell was in Scotland, had held fresh negotiations at Newport, in the Isle of Wight, with Charles, who, to the last, despite the urgent prayers both of his friends and the more moderate of his opponents, refused compliance with the conditions offered, though he must now have apprehended this to be the only means by which he could retain possession of his crown. The temper of the commons— after receiving tidings of the king's unconquered obstinacy—evinced by the distaste of the majority toward an angry speech of Vane, so much alarmed the leaders of the army, that, finding Hammond more disposed toward the parliament than they had hoped, they caused by stratagem the custody of the king's person to be transferred to Colonel Ewre, a man entirely in their interests, and ordered him to be removed at once to the strong solitary fortress of Hurst Castle, on the coast of Hampshire. A letter from the commons to the general, demanding instant restitution of the royal person to his former guardian and abode, was answered by a demand for payment of arrears due to the army, and, after a few days, by the march of the most zealous and enthusiastic regiments to London; the general taking up his quarters at Whitehall, and other officers with their detachments at Durham House, the King's Mews, Covent Garden, Westminster, and St. James's Palace. Still, undeterred by this bold step, the Presbyterian party, after a violent debate, carried it, by a majority of thirty-six against the independents and the army faction, that “the king's answer was a ground upon which for the houses to proceed for the settlement of the peace of the kingdom.” A resolution which, had it been brought into force, would have effectually undone all that had been effected by the long and bloody strife which had preceded it, and left the king as powerful for good or evil as he had been at its commencement, provided he should, as his true policy would dictate, hold to the friendship of the parliament. That afternoon a large committee of the commons waited upon the general at his lodgings of Whitehall, but met from him only a supercilious and cold welcome, and no satisfaction. The following morning, when the members went to take their seats, a guard of musketeers was at the doors, headed by Colonel Pride and the Lord Grey of Groby, who held a list of those who should not be permitted to go in to the debate, and these were kept three days in custody in different inns of court, while the remainder of the house, called afterward by royalists “the Rump,” voted that the king's answer to the propositions was not satisfactory. Sir Edgar, in the earlier part of the late tumults, had served with Fairfax, and, after the surrender of Colchester, had resigned his commission, disgusted by the fate of Lisle and Lucas. Meanwhile, however, he had been re-elected to the house, the Presbyterians considering his departure from the army as an earnest of his accession to their party, while the independents, wiser in this than their antagonists, foresaw that, howsoever he might disapprove their violence, he would, at the least, never join their enemies. On this account, then, he was suffered by the soldiers to assume his seat, his name not being on the list of those excluded. The first step which he took was to move instantly for an inquiry into the causes of the present outrage, and though, when overruled in this by a majority of those remaining in the house, he coincided with the opinion that the king's answer was unsatisfactory, he refused peremptorily to give any vote on the occasion. Then, after several vain attempts to find out the devisers of the violence, Fairfax denying any knowledge of it, and the guards merely stating that they had their orders, he at the first resolved to vacate his seat once again; but, after much reflection, held it the manlier and more upright course still to continue in the house, opposing, to the best of his abilities, all inroads on the liberties of Englishmen, in their most delicate and dearest point, the privilege of parliament. Just at this juncture, indeed, upon the very evening of the day which had been signalized by the exclusion of the Presbyterian members, Cromwell returned from Scotland, and took up his abode in the king's palace of Whitehall. To him, indeed, Ardenne's suspicions had first pointed as the real mover of this outrageous measure; yet, on his charging it directly to him, he answered with so much of ready frankness, that “he had not been acquainted with the design, yet, since it was done, he was glad of it, and would endeavour to maintain it,” and asked so warmly for his presence and advice at a council to be held that evening in the house of Ludlow, that he succeeded almost in convincing him that his suspicions were unfounded. An early hour of the evening found Sir Edgar at the place appointed, where he was shown into a large well-lighted chamber, filled with about two score of gentlemen, for the most part the leaders of the army; among whom, at the first glance, he recognised Ireton, Harrison, and Lilburne, afterward nicknamed Trouble-world, with Hacker, Hutchinson resembling a cavalier in his rich dress and flowing hair, and some of the most eminent civilians, Sir Harry Vane the younger, and some few of the Presbyterian party, besides the master of the house, and Cromwell, who sat aloof, as it would seem, engrossed in weighty meditation; Fairfax was not among them. When Sir Edgar entered Harrison was declaiming with much vehemence, as well of gesture as of speech, and not without a species of wild eloquence, against all forms of monarchy, which he asserted neither to be “good in itself, nor yet good for the people,” quoting the whole eighth chapter of the first book of Samuel, and argaing therefrom “that to be governed by a king was in itself displeasing to the King and Monarch of the universe, and absolutely sinful; for that the Lord himself bade Samuel yet solemnly protest unto them, and show the manner of the king that should reign over them;' and afterward foretold to them `that ye shall cry out in that day because of the king ye have chosen you, and the Lord shall not hear you in that day. Wherefore,” he added, “let us put away from us this sin and this abomination—let us wash from our hands the stain of this iniquity—yea! let us cleanse ourselves with myrrh, with aloes, and with hyssop, ay, and with blood—even the blood of sacrifice!—from this offence which stinketh in the nostrils of Jehovah! And let this man—the firebrand of eivil conflagration—the drawer of the slaughtering sword against his people—the slayer of our brethren and our sons—the spoilers of our vineyards and our oliveyards—this faithless gentleman and perjured prince—this tyrant, traitor, murderer, Charles Stuart—let him be driven out, even as the scapegoat sent into the wilderness to bear away the sins and sufferings of the people—let him be cut off utterly, and cast upon the dunghill, and let the dogs lick his blood, as they licked that of Ahab, when the Lord smote him by the arrow of the Syrian—smote him at Ramoth Gilead that he died —and let his name be never named in Israel from thenceforth ever more! So let it be with him, and let the people cry amen!” To Harrison succeeded Ireton, and Ludlow after him, both urging the expediency of the king's death no less strongly than its justice—descanting loudly on the faithlessness which he had shown in all his previous dealings —“his often protestations and engagements in the name of a king and gentleman which he hath so often violated”—and the small probability that any new bond or restraint of conscience should now be found to fetter one, whom neither his own coronation oath nor the laws which he had sworn to honour, uphold, and obey, could hinder from endeavouring to subvert his country's constitution, and build an autocratic throne upon the ruin of his people's freedom. When these had finished speaking, Sir Edgar ealmly but impressively addressed them, beseeching them to ponder deeply and pause long ere they should take a step irrevocable, and, if it should prove evil, irretrievable and ruinous. Admitting, as fully as the warmest advocates for the king's death, his guilt in aiming at supreme unconstitutional dominion—his guilt in plunging the whole population intrusted to his care—even as children to a father's charge—into the misery of civil slaughter, merely to gratify his own ambition—his guilt in violating every covenant and compact he had made!—owning the utter hopelessness of any effort to establish peace while he should be within the realm, in how close custody soever—the folly of imagining that England's liberties could be in safety while he should hold the reins of government, how limited soever in his sway!—declaring that he believed him in all justice to be guilty even unto death—“I yet conjure you,” he exclaimed, “to pause before you shed his blood! If ye depose him from the throne, and banish him the realm, ye will gain all advantage that his death could give you, and more also!—ye will disarm the tongues of those who would cry out against his execution as against a sacrilegious and accursed parricide, and fill the very mouths that would be open to revile you, with praises of your clemency and grace. Ye will deprive him wholly of the means to do you evil, and ye will have this farther safeguard, that, while he lives, no other can lay claim to England's crown, whereas, once dead, his son will instantly succeed to all his father's rights, Vol. II.—N and more than all his father's influence on the minds of men maddened with loyal sorrow and athirst for vengeance. It was a wise and politic saw of the old Romans, `to spare the subject and subdue the proud!' To slay Charles Stuart is but to elevate a bad king to an honoured martyr!—to depose and banish him is to degrade him from a suffering prince into a scorned and abject beggar! Men will compassionate, and honour, ay! and bleed for royalty in chains, when they but jeer and scoff at royalty in tatters! Banish this man, and he may wander forth from court to court of Europe; he may be treated with mock deference, may be styled king and brother, and pensioned with the crumbs that fall from royal tables—but 'twill be hollow all and insincere! Scorned and despised, he will drag out a life held by your sufferance, weary and painful to himself, and innocent to you even of momentary cause for apprehension! Slay him, and ye will buckle harness on the back of each legitimate hereditary prince of Christendom against you!—ye will concentrate and renerve the partisans of royalty now scattered, hopeless, and undone!—ye will enkindle a consuming flame, which, though for a brief space it may smoulder or burn dimly, shall yet wax hourly more broad, and bright, and high, till it shall soar in triumph over the liberties of England, shrivelled again, and blasted, perchance, never to revive!” His views, shrewd and farsighted as they were, and couched in language bold and perspicuous, produced a great effect on the more moderate of either party, and he was followed by several of the Presbyterians on the same side, and even by one or two of the milder officers; but the more zealous held to their opinions, and urged them with all their wonted force and ingenuity, and the debate waxed warm, a strong majority, however, leaning evidently toward the death of Charles and the abolition of all royal power in Great Britain. It was, moreover, brought into debate, and discussed very earnestly, by what means—if it should be decided that Charles Stuart must die—his death should be effected—some hesitating not to advocate his private taking off by poison or the dagger, so to avoid the scandal and the odium of his public execution—to whom the honest but fanatical and visionary Harrison replied in words of fire, repudiating the idea of such foul and midnight murder, and declaring that, as their cause was just, so should their vengeance be both bold and open!— that, as his crimes were evident, so should their punishment be manifest and in the face of day! “What,” he exclaimed, with real eloquence, “shall we, the workers of the grandest revolution earth ever has beheld—the conscience-armed deliverers of England—the champions of a nation's freedom —the Christian warriors of an all-seeing God— shall we take off our foe by ratsbane in the dark, or slay him with a hireling knife, for a mere paltry dread of what the world shall say? Not so! not so! but we will point the world's voice by our actions—fetter its opinion by our boldness! Let Charles, I say, let Charles THE KING be brought to trial in the presence of his peers—THE PEOPLE! There, if he be found guilty, let him be led to execution in the world's eye and the sun's! Let him be slain as a deliberate and solemn sacrifice—offered as a high victim at the shrines of freedom and of God! With honour and respect to the great station he has held, but with implacable and stern resentment toward the crimes by which he has defiled it, as he hath done to others so let us do to him, not as vile stabbers and assassins, but as elected judges, acting for men below, and answerable to the Lord on high! Let him henceforth be an ensample unto those who would enslave their fellows. Let England be a precept to all nations, that, when oppressed, they shall arise in the unconquerable strength of purity, and honesty, and truth! —that they shall battle boldly, and unto success!— that they shall judge impartially!—and execute inflexibly the high decrees of justice and of vengeance!” Throughout this stirring scene, to Edgar's great astonishment, Cromwell took no share in the argument, nor did he even seem to pay the grave attention which the subject merited to the opinions of the speakers. Much of the time he was engaged in whispering, and even jesting, with those who sat beside him; and once or twice indulged in those rude ebullitions of practical humour which had made him such a favourite in the camp, but which were most unsuitable and unbecoming in a grave and sorrowful debate, involving, it might be, the life and death of thousands, the fate of a most ancient line of kings, the future government of a great and glorious empire. Not a little astonished and disgusted at this conduct, Sir Edgar watched him closely, to detect, if possible, the causes of his mood and the internal workings of his mind; but, after a long survey, being still in doubt whether he had brought to the council a mind predetermined and unalterably fixed, or whether he had put on levity of manner to conceal irresolution and a perturbed spirit, he called openly on Cromwell to give his opinion. “Verily,” answered he, “verily I am yet unresolved. Have at thee, Ludlow!” he continued, springing to his feet, with a loud boisterous laugh, and hurling at the head of the republican a cushion of the sofa on which he was sitting, with such violence as almost to overturn him, upsetting at the same time several candles, and throwing the whole council into confusion, under cover of which he ran out of the room, and was already half way down the stairs, when Ludlow, who had pursued him, struck him between the shoulders with the same missile, and drove him head-foremost down the flight of steps and through the door, which had been opened by a servant in expectation of his exit. Thus ended the discussion and the council for that evening; but, within a week, the House of Commons appointed a committee “to prepare a charge of high treason against the king, which should contain the several crimes and misdemeanours of his reign; which, being made, they would consider the best way and manner of proceeding that he might be brought to justice.” About the same time some idle intercessions, at the request of the prince, were made in the behalf of Charles by the states-general of Holland, and a letter yet more idle sent by the queen to be delivered to the parliament. In a short time the charge of the committee was prepared and approved by the commons. The House of Lords, indeed, rejected it; and, instantly adjourning for a week, on their return found their doors locked by orders of the lower house, and, being thus excluded, sat no more for many years. Then a high court of justice was appointed, of the most celebrated and influential men, civil and military, in the realm. Bradshaw, a lawyer of great talent and inflexible boldness, was named lord president, invested with much state, and having lodgings suitable to his high office assigned to him at Westminster. The royal prisoner was brought up from Hurst to Windsor under a powerful guard of Harrison's command, and thence N 2 to his own palace at St. James, where he was held in rigorons custody, while every preparation was made for the accomplishment of that great tragedy, with the report of which “Europe was soon to ring from side to side.” CHAPTER VI. “Mal. If such a one be fit to govern, speak; Moc. Fit to govern! No, not to live. Oh nation miserable!” Macbeth. The day at length arrived, big with the fate of England and her king—the twentieth of January, memorable thenceforth through every age for the most solemn and sublimely daring measure recorded in the annals of the world. At an extremely early hour the members of the high court of justice, which had been constituted with the utmost labour by the military council that swayed the helm of state, so as to be a fair representation of all ranks and classes of society, assembled in the painted chamber. All the chief members of the independent party in the commons—Lord Fairfax, Cromwell, Skippon, Ireton, as the four generals, with all the colonels of the army—the two chief justices and the chief baron—six peers—five aldermen of London—several from the most leading barristers—and many baronets and country gentlemen of note, had been at the first summoned to the discharge of this unprecedented trust; but, when the House of Lords refused its sanction to the ordinance for bringing of the king to justice, the peers and judges were omitted. Sir Harry Vane, Algernon Sidney, St. John, and some other stanch republicans, who, although friendly to the king's deposition, were not consenting to his death, refused to sit as members of the court; and many more, either from fear or conscience, failed answering to their names. While the commissioners were here assembled, Ardenne among the rest, news was brought to them on a sudden that his majesty had landed at Sir Robert Cotton's stairs, on which Cromwell, who had been previously conversing with sundry of his intimates among the judges, with the same air of jocularity which had so strongly marked his conduct during the earlier consultation, rose suddenly from the place where he had been sitting, and moved with rapid but unequal steps toward the window. The keen eye of Sir Edgar followed him, and, to his no small wonder, he perceived that the hands, which the daring chieftain laid upon the wainscot to support him as he leaned his body forward to look upon the royal captive, quivered so violently as almost to communicate a tremour to his frame; and, when he turned away, after a long and anxious gaze upon the destined victim, although his eye was steady and unblenching, and his mouth firmly compressed and calm, his whole face, usually so rubicund and sanguine in its colouring, was ghastly pale, and his lips white as ashes. Marvelling greatly at this change in one so stern and inaccessible to ordinary feelings; remembering, too, the widely different glance with which, at a more early period of his great career, the eye of Cromwell had completely quelled the proud man at whose aspect he now faltered; and wishing to investigate the state of mind which caused so strange a revelation of contending passions, Sir Edgar was just stepping forward to address him, when the doors were thrown wide open, and the judges summoned to the court. Westminster Hall, that most sublime and ancient specimen of architecture, brought to perfection, which modern art has vainly sought to imitate, by those whom, in our overweening vanity, we children of a later day presume to style barbarians, had been prepared, with singular attention to details, for this most dread solemnity. Benches, row above row, covered with crimson velvet for the commissioners, filled all the upper end; Bradshaw, the learned and undaunted president, sat in the centre of the front rank on a splendid chair, attired in rich dark-coloured robes, and supported on the right hand and the left by his assessors, Say and Lisle, with a long table similarly decked before them. The galleries were crowded almost to suffocation by spectators pale with excitement and anxiety, while the whole body of the building was filled by an enormous multitude upon the right, and by a regiment of musketeers upon the left, in caps of steel and polished corslets, with their pieces loaded and their ready matches lighted, a narrow passage being marked out with silken cords between the soldiery and populace, affording a free passage from the doorway to the bar. The judges entered in the midst of a silence so stern and deep, that the slight rustling of their mantles and their feet on the thick carpets, which were strewn within the bar, was clearly audible. Solemn, severe, and sad, they took their seats—each man of them, as it appeared, almost oppressed by the intense feeling of the vast responsibility which had been laid upon him, and each determined to acquit himself as became one called to act, as it were, before the real and imbodied presence of his country and his God. As Ardenne looked around him, he felt the blood thrill painfully in every pore of his own frame! He saw that the same process was at work in all around him! Never had he beheld so pale a concourse! Yet, amid all that colourless and ashy pallor, there was no sign of trepidation or dismay; it was the outward aspect of a mind within so rigidly and painfully resolved, that it had gathered all the blood toward its citadel the heart, not the weak failing of the flesh through doubt or terror. Scarce had their seats been taken ere the doors of that great hall were opened, and a sedan chair, preceded and surrounded by a guard of carbineers, was carried to the bar, where a large chair of velvet was set forth for the king's accommodation. There was a pause of intense interest as the prisoner stepped out—it seemed as if the heart of each man in that huge apartment had ceased from its pulsations—not a hand moved, not a breath was drawn. It was, however, but for a moment; for the king instantly came forth, dressed in his usual garb of sable silk, decked only by the star and garter, and wearing on his head his high-crowned hat, which he did not remove, when, after a stern and haughty look of mingled pride and sadness on the assembled court, he calmly took the seat prepared for his reception. Nor did he then, by any glance or sign of courtesy, acknowledge or show any reverence to the court; but, after sitting still for a few minutes' space, arose again, and, having turned completely round with his back toward the judges, gazed steadfastly down the long area of the hall with the same severe aspect as before, until the crier of the court began to read the ordinance of parliament commanding his arraignment in a sharp ringing voice, that filled the whole apartment with its distinct and high-pitched tones. Then he again sat down, with his eyes fixed immoveably on the commanding and undaunted features of the president. The parliament's commission ended, the names of all the judges were called over—and, first, that of the president, who answered in a clear voice, quiet and unmoved by any tremour. Then the lord-general was summoned, and straight there was a pause of unexpected silence, for no one answered. Again the crier's accents wakened the echoes of the hall—“Lord Fairfax!”—and this second time a shrill voice, though musical and soft, replied. “He has more wit,” it said, “than to be present here!” The court rose in confusion—there was a momentary tumult, and a clamour of stern import both from the judges and spectators; but Bradshaw's high notes, pealing like a silver trumpet's above the din of tongues, enforced tranquillity, and, calling on the officers to seize the person who had dared contemn the court, appeased the short-lived riot. But when, after a hasty search, no one could be discovered, the calling of the commissioners proceeded, until nearly eighty had answered to their names. Then, with an air of deep religious feeling, mixed with the consciousness of high authority, engraved on his strong features, marked, as they were, by lines of wearing thought, and pale from studious vigils over the midnight lamp, Bradshaw arose; and his voice, though it faltered not, was subdued almost unto tenderness as he addressed the royal culprit. “Charles Stuart, king of England—the commons of England, being deeply sensible of the calamities that have been brought upon this nation, which are fixed upon you as the principal author of them, have resolved to make inquisition for blood; and, according to that debt and duty which they owe to justice—to God—to the kingdom, and themselves, they have resolved to bring you to trial and to judgment; and for that purpose have constituted the high court of justice before which you are now brought.” This said, Cook, the attorney of the commonwealth, who sat close to the person of the prisoner, rose to address the court; but the king, having in his hand a staff of ebony, tipped with a little head of silver, laid it upon his shoulder, and, in the deep tones of authority, commanded him to “Hold!” which word he still reiterated with warmth, that might almost have been termed violence, when he perceived that he was disobeyed at the lord-president's command. “My lord,” the attorney said, “I come here to charge Charles Stuart, the King of England, in the name of the commons of England, with treason and high misdemeanour. I desire that the said charge may be read!” And the lord-president giving direction to the clerk to read the charge, the king, in a yet louder and more angry voice, cried “Hold;” but Bradshaw, his large black eyes flashing with indignation, sternly forbade the clerk to notice the rude interruptions of the prisoner at the bar, but to get on to his duty—and the indictment was read instantly, containing, in effect, “that he had been admitted King of England, and trusted with a limited power to govern according to law; and, by his oath and office, was obliged to use the power committed to him for the good and benefit of the people; but that he had, out of a wicked design to erect himself an unlimited and tyrannical power, and to overthrow the rights and liberties of the people, traitorously levied war against the present parliament and the people therein represented.” It then enumerated the calamities which had befallen England—the free and noble blood which had been shed like water—the devastation of the fair face of the land, the burning of its rich and thriving cities, the slaughter of its bravest sons. It pointed to the causes—the commissions signed by his own hand for levying this domestic war— the raising of his standard in the town of Nottingham—his presence at Edgehill, and other battles fought under his eye and at his instigation—so many flagrant proofs that “he had been the author and contriver of these unnatural, cruel, and bloody wars; and was therein guilty of all the treasons, murders, rapines, burnings, spoils, desolations, damages, and mischief to the nation which had been committed in the said wars, or been thereby occastened; and that he was, therefore, now impeached for the said crimes and treasons, on the behalf and in the name of all the good people of England—” As the clerk read these words, while all the vast assemblage was hushed in the deep silence of attention and excitement, the same shrill voice which had before proclaimed the absence of the Lord-general Fairfax again exclaimed, in tones so thrilling that they penetrated every portion of the building—“No! nor one hundreth part of them.” The tumult which ensued was yet more wild and more alarming than before; the whole crowd sprang to their feet with a hoarse savage murmur, and a rush and a rustling of their feet and garments that might be heard to a considerable distance. One officer, a grim hard-featured fanatic, leaped forward from the ranks, and pointing with his sheathed rapier to that division of the galleries whence the disturbance had proceeded, furiously shouted to his men, bidding them “Level their muskets and give fire!” A fearful scene ensued—the heavy rattling of the matchlocks, as they were thrown forward, ready for instant use, by the fierce soldiery, was almost drowned by the cries, shrieks, and exclamations of the spectators, many of whom were females, all now in mortal terror at the prospect of receiving an immediate volley, rushing in all directions to and fro, and some of them endeavouring to drop down into the body of the hall. Before, however, time was given for the men to fire, it was announced to the lord-president that the disturber of the court was, in truth, no other or less personage than the Lady Fairfax, who had taken this extraordinary mode of testifying her dislike to the proceedings, and had been now persuaded to withdraw. On this announcement silence and peace was once again restored, and after a few moments the clerk went on with the arraignment, repeating the offensive words more loudly than before—“On the behalf and in the name of all the good people of England, as a tyrant, traitor, and murderer—and an implacable and public enemy to the commonwealth of England.” Then, with remarkable and singular ill-taste, and as ill-judgment, Charles, who had been continually gazing about the court in different directions, as if entirely free from interest of any sort in the proceedings—now lowering on the judges with cool contemptuous haughtiness—now glaring with an eye of bitter hatred on the dark soldiery which kept the avenues —now gazing with an air of sad reproachful gravity, not all unblent with pity, on the bulk of the spectators—actually burst out into a loud and ringing laugh as the word traitor was pronounced. Bradshaw again arose majestically firm and steady—though evidently moved to anger by the open undisguised contempt of Charles—and with strong emphasis, and evident determination to check this disrespectful levity on the king's part, though Vol. II.—O not without consideration for the high place and natural displeasure of the prisoner at the proceedings of the court, rebuked him for the tone and air he had adopted—a tone and air becoming neither his own dignity—his position at the present moment—nor the exaited duties and great power of the court before whom he stood arraigned. With the same air of unconcealed contempt which he had hitherto displayed, Charles listened to the president's address, and answered by a denial of the existence of any authority whatever in the court —of any right pertaining unto them or to the English people to hold their king to trial—or of any legal power at all vested in those before whom he now stood. Little occurred worthy of farther note during the three days of this singular and all-important ceremonial. The king, persisting in denial of the court's authority, refusing to plead to the indictment under which he stood arraigned, and constantly breaking in with frivolous and uncivil interruptions upon the business and proceedings of the trial, was, at the end of the first day, remanded, and the commissioners adjourned to the ensuing Monday, the twenty-second instant. Upon this second day the prisoner's behaviour was the same; and, after some considerable altercation, he was again remanded, and led back under close custody to Sir Robert Cotton's house, where lodgings were assigned to him during the hearing of his cause. Again, on the next day, the twenty-third, the court resumed, and, on the king's appearance at the bar, the commonwealth's attorney instantly craved judgment on him as contumacious; saying that the innocent blood shed by him cried aloud for justice. For the last time the prisoner was commanded by the president to plead, and warned that, by persisting in his present course, he would but draw upon him an immediate judgment; but Charles again refused to offer any answer or defence, crying out that he “valued not the charge a rush”—that he “would not now violate the trust his people had reposed in him, by owning a new court of judicature”—that “it was for their liberty he stood, and, but for this, he would not here object to giving satisfaction to the English people of the clearness of his past proceedings.” The clerk accordingly was ordered to record the prisoner's default—and the court once again adjourned until the twenty-seventh, sitting throughout the interval caused by the king's determination in the painted chamber daily, and hearing witnesses to the fact of his setting up the standard of his cause at Nottingham—the leading of his troops in armour at Edgehill, Newbury, and Naseby—the issuing of mandates and commissions to his officers for prosecution of the war!—and seeking to establish proofs with which they judged it needful to hold themselves provided, in case of the king's choosing at the last to plead. After this pause they met as previously, upon the twenty-seventh, in the great hall at Westminster, and the cause was once more resumed; but still the king refused to answer or submit; and then the president informed him that the court had considered and agreed upon a judgment, but yet—if he had any thing to say in defence of himself in respect to the matter charged— they were prepared to hear him. In reply, Charles demanded to be heard before both houses of the parliament, assembled in the painted chamber, before the passing of the sentence. This, after an adjournment of the court for half an hour to consider on the king's proposition, was refused, as being, in effect, but a new denial of their jurisdiction as now constituted, and a fresh contempt. On the return of the commissioners he was at once informed that he had all too long delayed the court already by his contempt and contumacy, and that they were resolved unanimously to proceed to judgment and to punishment. Then, in a long speech, eloquent and lucid, and replete with arguments which might appear most fitting to excuse and justify such a proceeding, and to convince the world of the right moral justice of a measure not certainly in strict conformity with legal precedents, Bradshaw proceeded to pass sentence on the prisoner— and, toward the end of his oration, urged on the king the scriptural example of David's late repentance for his imitation. Unmoved and haughty, with his dark features marked by no expression save a slight scornful sneer, Charles rose, still covered, and strove once again to interrupt him—demanding to be heard concerning those great imputations thus laid to his charge, but was again reminded that he had refused to own the court, and that too much delay and liberty had been already granted to him. The sentence was then read—the president affirming it to be “the sentence, judgment, and resolution of the whole court,” and all the members standing up to testify their full concurrence with their speaker. For the last time the royal culprit claimed to be heard; but, at the president's direction, the guards withdrew him, still exclaiming loudly—“that, since he was not suffered for to speak, he might expect what sort of justice other men should have of them!” Various and wild were the expressions of disgust and approbation among the multitude; some cried “God save the king!” despite the angry scowls and bitter menaces of the fanatical and furious guards —others, and far the most in numbers, shouted, with inflamed visages and bitter tones, “Justice!” and “Vengeance!” and “Away with him!”—and one, more brutal than the rest, offered to strike him with his hand as he was led forth from the hall, and actually spat upon his beard! The court arose! the members dispersed to their homes! the most unprecedented, singular, and solemn trial on record in the anuals of the universe was ended—a trial, wherein a puissant nation was the plaintiff—a king, the son and grandson of a long line of mighty and hereditary monarchs, the defendant—and the point at issue, the momentous question whether the kings of England should be despots over cringing and soul-shackled slaves, or the first magistrates of an enlightened, wise, and free, and potent people! Happily for England! happily for the world! the judges of that wondrous court were equal to the task. Their verdict was the fiat of their country's freedom—rational, moderate, and stable! and to the world that verdict set forth an example that has been followed, far and near, to the establishment of liberty, and happiness, and even-handed justice, in regions then obscured by the thick night of tyranny and ignorance! By his blood Charles Stuart sealed the charter of England's constitution; and, though for a short time the people lapsed again beneath a sway as absolute as his, it was but for a time!—and the seeds sown in that first revolution, moistened with noble blood, and matured by the stormy breath of war, though they lay dormant for a space, were not extinct, but grew up to a fair and fertile crop, and so have flourished since—and may they flourish so for ever! It may be that the death of Charles was a great legal wrong!—it may be that among his judges many were actuated by insane and senseless feelings of overstrained religion—that many were urged on by personal resentments!—personal O 2 hopes and fears!—personal pride!—and personal ambition! But, not the less for these things, it must be confessed that it was A GREAT MORAL RIGHT! If Charles deserved to live, no tyrant ever merited to die! If Charles had lived, England had never been, what she now is, THE FREE! nor would another land, the giant offspring of an immortal mother, have carried those same principles, for which her parent bled before her, into effect over a space a thousand times more mighty! The good traits of the man—such as they were, feeble and faintly marked, and showing rather the absence of strong vice than the existence of distinguishing and vivid virtue—must neither hide nor palliate the evil actions and worse motives of the king! That it was his design to do away, so far as in him lay, with England's constitution!—to reign uncurbed by parliaments—the only salutary check on regal sway!—to wield the boundless power of the nation's sword, and grasp with the same hand the vast resources of the nation's purse! —to mould the church into an instrument and weapon of his despotic government!—to reign, in short, an absolute and autocratic sovereign!—none can at this time doubt, unless they wilfully seal up their minds against the truth! In desperate diseases, means that at other times were desperate and deadly must be applied to cure! and it may be asserted, without much danger of disproof, that, by the death of Charles, and by that only, could the great principles of that immortal struggle have been wrought out to their fulfilment. It was twice needful!—needful, that it might hold up a terrible and salutary dread to future tyrants—that it might tear the roots of despotism from the soil they would have rendered sterile!—and doubly needful, that, by conducting England through the fearful ordeal of democratic anarchy, it might infuse a yet more salutary dread into the people, of liberty unregulated and immoderate—licentiousness, not freedom! These were, in part, the thoughts of Andenne as he subscribed his name to that strange instrument which, next to Magna Charta, may be looked upon in its results as the chief cause of England's present greatness. Under her previous sovereigns, ambitious, great, and wise as many of them doubtless were, England was but, at best, a secondary power. Under her first and sole usurper she blazed forth, on the instant, into a star of almost solar magnitude; and, but for that death-warrant, the navigation act had never given her dominion over the boundless seas, nor made her, as the great commercial nation, one of the mightiest springs and morers of the universe. What were the real motives of that man, who, if he did not absolutely bring about, might, beyond question, absolutely have prevented, the execution of the king, no human understanding may divine. But the great probability is, that, like most human motives; they were of mingled strain—half fire and half clay! Sir Edgar, in the course of the proceedings, had been convinced, to his full satisfaction, that the mind of Oliver was strangely and unnaturally overwrought. His coarse and vulgar jocularity at Ludlow's house—his paleness and unwonted trepidation on the king's first appearance— the little share he took in any portion of the trial, for, except one outbreaking of fierce temper when Mr. Downes, during the last adjournment, most pathetically urged the members to grant his majesty's demand of a joint conference of the three estates, he had scarce taken any interest in what was going forward—and, above all, his brutal and half-frantic jests during the same adjournment, when he daubed Henry Martin's face with ink, and jeered and laughed so as to move the wonder of all present—all these things, taken in connexion with the state in which he found him when he visited his chamber to beseech him after the sentence had been passed, had proved to Ardenne, past all doubt, that he was awfully perturbed in spirit. It was late in the evening of the day following the trial that Sir Edgar, who, though he had concurred in the sentence, wished its mitigation, sought Cromwell's lodging at Whitehall, nor was it without some urgency that he compelled the soldiers and domestics to admit him. The fortunate commander was already in possession of the superb apartments which had so lately called his fallen rival master. In the first antechamber of that gorgeous suite, two privates of the ironsides were sitting by a blazing fire, its bright light flashing from their steel armour and accoutrements in strong and painful contrast to the luxurious decorations and appliances of royal case among which they were seated. The second and third rooms of the suite were vacant, although dazzlingly illuminated by many waxen lights; but, long before he reached the door of the last room, Ardenne's attention was aroused by the deep groans, mingled with broken exclamations—snatches of fervent but disjointed prayer, and bursts of passionate and painful weeping, which fell upon his ear as he advanced. He rapped against the panel, but his signal was unheard, or, at the least, unheeded—though the sounds which he had heard had now ceased, saving only the sullen echoes of heavy and irregular steps, distinctly audible even as they fell on the soft texture of the three-plied Persian carpets. Scrupulous though he was, and jealous almost to excess of undue familiarity, Sir Edgar was too much excited now to stand on points of form. He turned the gilded handle, and almost noiselessly the door revolved upon its hinges; and, in one of his most dark moods, hypochondriac or conscience-stricken, that wonderful man stood before him. The large apartment sumptuously decked with furniture and hangings of splendid crimson velvet—the toilet-table with its appurtenances of transparent crystal and plate of solid gold—the royal arms of England embroidered on the tester of the bed, piled high with coverlets of down and satin, passed scarcely seen before the eyes of the spectator engrossed in observation of the strange being who now tenanted the halls of England's sovereign. A single light, and that obscure and waning, stood on the central table of some rich eastern wood, and on the hearth a few decaying brands, which had been suffered to burn low, smouldered with more of smoke than flame, casting a sickly and unnatural light about the chamber. But HE—the tenant!—with blood-shot eyes, and features ghastly wan and haggard— he strode to and fro with steps irregular and almost staggering—now waving his extended arm on high —now striking it upon his broad breast with a violence denoted plainly by the heavy and dull sound of the oft-repeated blows. Tears—copious and agonizing tears—those which console not nor relieve, but burn like vengeful fires—flowed down his hollow cheeks—and his words, wild as his gait and gestures, were now of bitter self-reproach, of accusation, and remorse—now of sincere and humble penitence—and now of fierce ecstatic triumph! —but, in an instant, in the twinkling of the eye, as he perceived that be was not alone, his air and aspect were, as if by magic transformation, utterly changed and calm. “Ha! good Sir Edgar,” he exclaimed, “this is a pleasure such as I have not long experienced— nor, though such friendly visitations were once ordinary things betwen us, of late days expected!” “I have called on you,” Ardenne gravely replied, “I have called on you now, lieutenant-general, not for mere ordinary reasons, whether of friendship or of ceremonial—but upon matters of great weight and interest to England! To come to the point at once, I have called here believing—and hoping likewise—that I shall find in you a real and unselfish patriot—one that regards not self-aggrandizement, or fame, or wealth, or power, when compared to his country's weal. In this hope—this belief— I have come to implore you, as a friend and faithful counsellor, that you will interpose your powerful influence to shield this most unhappy king from death. Justice required that he should be condemned—justice is satisfied! The great example is set forth to England and the universe!—all ends are answered that his execution can attain! And you, sir, who have won the brightest crown of warlike honour that has been witnessed in these later days, beware! Beware, I say, lest present times, ay! and posterity to boot, shall deem that, in permitting Charles to perish by the headsman's axe, you have looked rather to your own than to your country's interests! Kill him—for, in neglecting to preserve, you actually kill no less than if alone, and by a single mandate, you condemned him—kill him, and it may well be you shall reign yourself as monarch over England—but, to gain a precarious, short-lived, and unhappy eminence, you shall lose present peace and future glory—you shall cast from you the esteem and love of those who have bled and would die for you—you shall stand high in solitary friendless state—without the lingering consolation of a self-approving spirit! Spare him—save him—and you shall be the first for ever in the heart and judgment of every honest Briten—while England's name exists, yours shall live in coeval glory—the title of the loftiest worth —the purest patriotism—the most disinterested clemency that earth has witnessed since her young surface bore the steps of giants and of angels!” “Nay! you wax warm in eloquence!” Oliver answered, coldly. “Surely your zeal doth eat you up! yea, the desire of your heart doth rise up to your brain, and cloud its better reason. I would— ay, of a surety I do profess to you—I would lay down not merely the poor honour—that vainest and most fickle breath of human fantasy—which you ascribe to me, to whom it is not due, but to the Lord of Hosts!—but my life even—my existence upon earth!—my hope of seeing England the freest and the first of European princedoms!—that so this bruised and bending reed might not be trodden in the mire—this frail and half-cracked potsherd might not be shivered into atoms! But, when the Lord hath spoken, what mortal shall gainsay him? Was it not borne into our hearts—branded with characters of living fire upon the inmost tablets of our souls—`Ye shall avenge my people—for their blood and their children's blood, which he hath spilled upon the ground that hath not drunk it up, calleth aloud for vengeance!—yea! ye shall slay the king.' Is it not written that `ye shall not suffer one of them to live!' and what are we that we should contradict Jehovali? I could not if I would—I could not if I would—and that I would do so, as the game stands, I say not—now save Charles Stuart from the infliction of that righteous sentence which you have aided to pass on him! The people have arisen in their might—the people's voice hath gone forth to the utmost portions of the world, `The king shall surely die!' the people's voice is God's voice! Hear it and tremble—hear it and obey!” At once the latest hope of Edgar vanished; the firm determination, evinced not by words only, but by the cold hard eye, the compressed lip, the clinched hand, and the hard-set teeth through which the low stern voice was sent out in a harsh and hissing whisper, proved to him so distinctly, as to banish even hope, that Charles had not a possibility, much less a chance, of life at Cromwell's intercession! and from the lip of Cromwell only could any intercession come that should prevail over the angry prejudices and morose fanaticism of the army! Seeing the fruitlessness of effort, he desisted! With a sick heart and boding spirit he departed from the presence of the arbiter, whom even now he knew not whether to think an over-zealous patriot or an ambitious hypocritical adventurer, playing a deep game for a mighty venture, and strode away to find in his lone lodging a sleepless bed disturbed by ominous and sad presagings—by doubts, by sorrow, by remorse!—for he already had begun bitterly to repent the part which he had borne in the great revolution now about to terminate so tragically for the ruler—so disastrously, as his fears told him, for the ruled— and, above all, so fatally for England's permanent and real peace. Scarcely had Edgar gone from Cromwell's presence, before a new petitioner arrived, and, with yet more of difficulty than the former had experienced gained access to the presence of his kinsman; for that petitioner was no other than his cousin, Colonel John Cromwell, an officer of the Dutch service, and commissioned as his agent with the parliament by the Prince of Wales, who at this time, resided at the Hague. In the commencement of the interview the able and accomplished soldier confined himself to solemn and ceremonious remonstrances against the act in contemplation; assuring his great relative of the resentment, horror, and disgust which this atrocious crime—for so he hesitated not to call it— would kindle throughout every Christian land!— would kindle, not against England, nor the parliament, nor army—but against him alone, who, as the world well knew, could wind the reins of government just as he listed, pointing the councils of the one and wielding the war-weapons of the other! “Tush! cousin,” answered Oliver, “tell me not of atrocity and crime! 'Tis a great act of sovereign and solemn justice!—but, were it as you say, I have no power to alter it. It is the army, and not I, who will inflict this justice on the king, brooking not any let nor hindrance.” “Remember you not, sir,” exclaimed the other, “how, some twelve months ago, you did profess to me, that `rather would you draw your sword in the defence of Charles, than suffer these republicans to harm one hair upon his head!'—have you forgotten this and other such asseverations, or do you wilfully and of aforethought violate your word?” “Well, right well I remember it!” Cromwell replied, in tones of great asperity, “and well you do now to remember me of it; for so you remind me of his base and lying insincerity, that drove the faithful and brave army into such bitterness of wrath as not even I could stem, either by force or counsel! The times are changed—the times are changed, and strangely! since I spoke so to you— and on his own head be his blood!—for by his own craft, his own ingrate and selfish subtlety, hath he dragged down on him this ruin. If it be true, that whom the gods have destined to destruction they first deprive of reason, as the wise Ethnics did believe, Vol. II.—P then hath the Lord of Hosts hardened the heart of this man that he should die, not live!” “You are determined, then, to do this deed of infamy and horror?” the foreign officer demanded. “I am determined!” Oliver answered, sternly, “I am determined not to interfere with England's course of judgment. I have prayed for the king, and fasted! yea, I have striven with the Lord these many times that some way might be given me to save him—but no return hath yet been made to me, nor any sign, ner answer!” Then Colonel Cromwell rose up from his seat, and walking with light steps toward the doorway, cautiously looked out, and satisfied himself that no one was within earshot; then turning the key with a wary hand, and dropping a strong night-latch, he returned, and drawing from his bosom an emblazoned parchment containing his credentials, and a large sheet of vellum perfectly blank and vacant, but signed at length and sealed, in his own name and for his royal father, by Charles Stuart, prince of Wales and heir apparent, he laid them on the table under the eye of his bold kinsman. “Cousin,” he said, “it is no time to dally now with mere words in this matter. Look here at this carte blanche. It is in your sole power now to make—not yourself only—but your posterity, and family, and kindred, happy, and great, and honourable through all ages! Else, as they changed their name in bygone days from Williams unto Cromwell, so now must they be forced to change it once again; for this one fact will bring such infamy upon the name and the whole generation of them, that no after ages will be able to wipe out the shameful stain!” The general's features worked convulsively, and his face flushed crimson, and paled, and flushed again, as he heard this address; and his hand dropped down to his dagger's hilt, and griped it with such force as if he would have buried his strong fingers in the ivory pommel; but, when his guest had ended, he answered in a quiet voice, though evidently guarded and constrained. “You have done!” he said, “you have done, sir, and I have heard you out! I have been hitherto calm!—very calm,” he continued, gradually warming, as he spoke, into fierce ire; “I have endured to hear my motives questioned—my assertions doubted—and the great cause, of which I am a most unworthy, but a most sincere supporter, scoffed at, and vilified, and held up as atrocious in the world's eye, infamous, and shameful! Calmly I have endured all this!—nay, I have heard my own good name traduced, my family dishonoured, the name of Cromwell coupled—coupled, I say, as if synonymous—with villany and its reward—disgrace! Calmly I have endured this also! But you have dared to bribe me! presumed to fancy that you could buy me, not like a fettered captive in the body, but like a renegado and apostate in the chainless mind. You! you—a Cromwell— have ventured, face to face, to offer me the basest of affronts—to tender to me gold, and rank, and titles, to turn me from my righteous purpose—to seduce me from my conscience, my allegiance, and my honour! Thank God—thank God!—I say, thank God, if you believe in him—that I am regenerate, and you a Cromwell—for were I one jot more a sinner than I am—or you one tittle less connected with my blood—then had I sheathed this dagger”—and, as he spoke, he drew and dashed the weapon furiously upon the ground before his feet—“dudgeon deep in your heart! Begone! you have your answer!” Truly had Oliver said that the tempter was of his own blood; for he rose firmly from his chair, and, with an erect and unflinching carriage, looked full in his enraged kinsman's eye till he ceased speaking; and then—“Tush! cousin Oliver,” he said, “I care not for your vagaries of passion—I am a soldier, man, and not a woman or a child, that words can daunt me. But now you are distempered—think of this matter deeply; weigh it, and ponder on it ere you answer. I shall await, at my inn, your reply until to-morrow morning. Give you good-night and better temper!” and he withdrew, believing in his heart that Oliver's rage was but assumed, and that the golden bait would take. But sadly was he destined to be deceived; for, at about an hour after midnight, a messenger came to him from Whitehall, and told him he might now go to bed, for he must not expect any more answer than he had unto the prince; for that the council of the officers had again been seeking God —and there was no hope for it, but the king must die. Accordingly, upon the following morning, the celebrated twenty-ninth of January, Charles, after a mournful parting with his children, was led through the palace-garden and park of St. James to his own chamber at Whitehall, where he prayed for a space with Bishop Juxon, who afterward accompanied him to the block; thence to the banqueting-hall, and thence, through a passage broken in the wall, unto the scaffold. There, after a short speech, which he concluded by declaring that he “had a good cause—he had a gracious God—and, therefore, he would say no more,” he laid down his head on the block, and died, with such a perfect dignity, such a serene and modest fearlessness, unmixed with any thing of boldness or parade, as to justify the observation, applied originally to another, that “no action of his life became him like the leaving of it!” CHAPTER VII. “Now there he lies, With none so poor to do him reverence.” Julius Cæsar. “Tot populis terrisque superbum Regnatorem Asiæ. Jacet ingens litore truncus A volsumque humeris caput, et sine nomine corpus.” æneid, II., 556. Midnight was on the mighty city. The happy sleep had swept away the cares of thousands in its still deathlike oblivion. The multitudes who had assembled to sate themselves with gazing on the sad yet exciting spectacle of the morning, wearied and worn out with the unnatural tension of their nerves during that day of horror, had passed away to seek a contrast in the repose of their domestic chambers. The very guards were slumbering on their posts about the precincts of Whitehall, and not a sound or breath disturbed the silence of the night. Within the palace, in one of those sublime apartments which he had loved so well while living, upon a lofty bed, adorned with crimson curtains, and rich ostrich plumes, and the gold-blazoned arms of England, lay a plain oaken coffin, half covered with a pall of sable velvet. Many tall waxen torches blazed around the room in candlesticks of solid silver, six feet at least in height, and their light glanced upon a narrow plate of silver decking the coffin's lid, whereon were these few words, “King Charles—1648.” No mourning crowds wept round the couch whereon the hapless prince slept that cold sleep that knows no P 2 earthly waking. No coroneted peers watched over the embalmed remains—no flippant pages hushed their accustomed merriment in reverence to the ashes of their master—no guard of honour, with trailed arms and downcast visages, stood sentinel without the door; but, with their carbines loaded, sheathed in their buff coats and bright armour, two privates of the ironsides strode to and fro, passing each other and repassing at brief intervals—the ringing of their heavy armature, and the loud sounds of their spurred and booted footfalls, awakening strange echoes in that apartment of the dead. The night wore onward, and the stars began to wink in the cold skies, and the first coming of the morn was felt in the increasing chillness of the air; hitherto had the watch of those unusual mourners been lonely and uninterrupted. The clock, however, was just striking three, and its loud cadences were vocal still through the long vacant halls and vast saloons of the deserted palace, when a remote and stealthy footstep broke upon the silence which was succeeding fast to the loud chimes. The soldiers interchanged alarmed and jealous glances, blew their slow matches to a vivid flame, and, listening with wary ears and ready weapons, resumed their guarded walk. Nearer and nearer came the step, firm, regular, and low, but evidently not desirous of avoiding observation—now it was at the door—it paused, and, bringing simultaneously their weapons to the level, the soldiers halted between the body and the door, and challenged loudly, “Stand, ho! the word. Stand, or we shoot!” “Justice and freedom!” answered a harsh and croaking voice—and, bearing in his right hand a small waxen taper, and in his left a staff of ebony, Oliver Cromwell entered. He was dressed plainly in a full suit of black cloth, with silken hose, and a loose cloak of broadcloth faced with velvet, a very light black-hilted rapier hanging from his girdle in lieu of the long heavy broadsword which he so rarely laid aside; his face was very pale, but perfectly composed and grave, with the mouth firmly closed, and the eyes shining with a steady and unaltered light. “Good watch,” he cried, as he came in, “you keep good watch. Cold work, I trow, and cheerless. What would ye say now to a flagon of October—hey! Stephenson, hey! Bowtell? So! so! ye are on duty, ye would say—well, interrupt me not for that—I will relieve ye for a brief space— but one at a time—one only! Stephenson, give me thy carbine and the match—and now get thee down to the buttery; tarry not over half an hour, and return straightway to take bluff Bowtell's place!” The soldier grinned significantly, gave up his weapon to his officer, and walked off greatly pleased at this brief intermission of an unpleasant duty. Cromwell looked after him as he departed, and, when his footsteps had sunk into silence, depositing the carbine he had taken in a corner, he walked up slowly to the coffin with a strong stately step and unmoved aspect. “He hath not broken on thy watch, then?” he demanded, with a grim smile, but evidently speaking thoughtfully and with emotion, although wishing to conceal his feelings by an assumption of unfeeling merriment; “he hath not waked to scare ye?” “Now may the Lord forbid,” returned the superstitious soldier, half alarmed at the words and manner of his officer; “what mean you, worthy general?” “Why, how now, simpleton?” Cromwell replied; “you look, in truth, as if he had walked forth in his untimely cerements to affright you. But fear not, Bowtell, fear not!—the king sleeps sound!— and shall sleep till the day when the great trumpet of Jehovah shall call him to a mightier judgment, and, it may well be, to a darker doom! Have they screwed down the coffin?” he continued; “I fain would look upon him;” and he moved closer to the bed, and, throwing back the pall of velvet, tried to raise the lid; but, though not permanently fastened down, it yet resisted the attempt, being held tightly by some two or three stout spikes. After a moment's pause he thrust the ferrule of his staff into the chink, and made an effort thus to draw the nails out of their sockets; but they had been driven in too firmly, and the staff creaked as though it would have broken. “Lend me thy rapier,” he exclaimed; “its steel hilt will have strength enough;” and, with the word, he forced the pommel into the aperture between the lid and side, and, leaning heavily upon the weapon as a lever, wrenched up the cover with an impetus so sudden that the nails flew into the air, and struck against the canopy which overhung it. Then he stood fixed, and, for a short time, speechless, regarding, with a disturbed and cloudy brow, the mangled body of his victim. The body, which had been opened and embalmed, was swathed in bandages of linen drawn so tightly round the limbs, that, when the shroud was lifted, the perfect form and the development of all the muscles might be traced as plainly as while he was in life—the head, partially covered by an embroidered napkin bound about the brows, and a broad riband of white silk fastened beneath the chin, was in its proper place; but a small interval, that showed like a discoloured streak of dingy red, marked its disseverment. The face was pale, but scarcely more so than its wont, and far less ashy in its hues than that of the undaunted warrior who leaned over it. The lips retained their usual and healthful colour, with something of a smile still visible about them; the eyes were closed, but naturally, and as if in sleep; the nose preserved its wonted form, unsharpened as yet by the iron hand of death. There was, indeed, no sign or symptom of a painful and untimely dissolution on those serene and comely lineaments—something there might be of a languor not characteristic of the living man, of a placidity and peace more deep than usual; but nothing which could have led any one to fancy that the thread of life had been snapped violently, for him who slumbered there so tranquilly, by the rude weapon of the executioner. For a long time Cromwell spoke not a word—nor moved a limb—nor even winked an eyelid—steadfastly, solemnly gazing on the features of his fallen foe and rival. “He sleeps indeed!—he sleeps, how peacefully and well! That eye shall flash no more with kingly pride; that lip be wreathed no more into the calm but haughty sneer! The busy brain, that plotted so much wo to England—the indomitable mind, that would not swerve one hairbreadth from its purpose, no, not to purchase life— are these—are these, too, in repose, like that cold voiceless lip, that nerveless and inanimate right hand? Is that sleep dreamless? Doth the soul, plunged in a dark and senseless torpor, lie paralyzed and shorn of its pervading vigour in the abyss of Hades?—or hath it but awakened from this trance, after the turmoil of mortality, to more complete perfection—to consciousness, and wisdom, and unchanged immortality? Dost thou know, thou cold form—dost thou know now who stands beside thee? He who continually strove against the tyranny thou wouldst have set up in the land! —he who beat down thy banner in the field, and swept thy gallant cavaliers like dust before the whirlwind!—he who brought down thy glory from the throne, and paved thy path to that still hostelry —the grave? Dost thou know this—and yet not start from out thy bloody cerements? I do but dream,” he went on, after a moment's pause—“the king is nothing! a mere clod in the valley! `Hell from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. All they shall speak and say unto thee—Art thou also become weak as we?—art thou become like unto us? Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee! How art thou fallen from Heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down, which didst weaken the nations!' Thus was it written of a mightier one than thou— thus hath it been with thee! Thy place is empty upon earth—thy country no more knows thee! Verily thou art fallen asleep—asleep for many a thousand years—until thou shalt be summoned to make answer in the spirit for all thy deeds wrought in the flesh. Yet then, even then, wilt thou have nothing, fallen great one, nothing to witness against me. But for thine own self-will—thine own tyrannical and senseless folly—thine own oppressing of the saints, and trampling under foot the delicate and tender consciences of men—nay, more than all this, but for thine own false-dealing and foul treachery toward those who would have served thee truly —thou mightst have still sat in the high place of thy forefathers!—thou mightst have outshone them, so far as the sovereign of a free and mighty nation outshines the chieftain of an enslaved and paltry tribe!—thou mightst have been served by hands and swords, through the Lord's help, invincible—honoured and loved by hearts loyal, sincere, and single-minded!—thou mightst have fulfilled the number of thy days, dying in green old age amid the tears and lamentations of thy people, and bequeathing to thy sons that puissant and time-honoured sceptre which now shall never more be wielded by thy race. Alas! alas! for man! Who that looked on thee in thy fair and princely youth would have presaged so sad an end to thy bright-seeming fortunes? Surely this frame of thine, which mine own eyes have seen so proud-enthroned upon thy charger's back, rallying thy followers through the havoc and the terror of the battle— surely this frame of thine, so strongly knit, and muscular, and manly, was formed to baffle hardships and to brave long years! Surely, but for thine own insane and selfish folly, thou wast formed to die old! Lo!” and, as he thus spoke, he laid the finger of his right hand in the gaping wound, and with cool scrutiny examined the consistency and texture of the muscles, “lo! how sound is this flesh, how wiry and elastic these dissevered sinews. There is no symptom here of disease or debility! —no decay—no corruption of the system! But for the axe, he had lived years—ay! many and long years! But, verily, all things are of the Lord —and had He not predestined him to die, then had he hardened not his heart, nor raised up foes against him, of whom it is a scripture that `none shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken.' Whom the Lord listeth to destroy, surely he striveth but in vain; for who shall find strength in the sword, or refuge in the speed of horses, against the Lord of Hosts? Then say not that I slew thee, but the Lord—for how had I defended thee against the God of Battles—or how had I acquitted whom He had judged to destroy?” He paused from the long wild declamation which he had poured out in the perturbation of his spirit, half conscious, and, perhaps, half self-convicted of criminal ambition, and struggling to convince himself entirely of the truth of the dark creed he had adopted, and thus to satisfy his restless spirit by a halt voluntary self-deception. The sentinel, meantime, had stood beside him, with his hand still outstretched as when he first extended it to receive again his sword, gazing partly in admiration, partly in fear and awe, now on the calm and rigid countenance of the dead king, now on the varying and agitated features of his almost remorseful judge, but less astonished at the scene than would have been expected, in consequence of the prevailing custom of his party to pray and preach, with every species of whining cant or furious raving, on all occasions anywise uncommon or surprising. For several minutes' space Oliver gazed again in silence on the body, and then replacing the lid gently and almost tenderly—“Farewell,” he said, “farewell on earth for ever! Strangely have we been linked together here below, and wonderfully do we part! Hadst thou prevailed, my fate had been more bitter! Farewell! farewell! we meet no more, whether for good or evil, until that final meeting when God must judge between us two—till then, sleep soundly—and then awake—He only knows—to what!” He then replaced the screws, and threw the pall across the coffin as before, the soldier Bowtell holding a torch, which he had taken from the nearest candelabrum, to assist him; this finished, he withdrew a pace or two, wrapped his cloak closely round him, and sat down upon a settle near the bed. The soldier, having replaced the light, stood for a little time in silence, and then—“I pray you tell me now,” he said, “heutenant-general, what mode of government shall we now have?” “The same as then was!” he answered, in a sharp decisive tone; and, instantly relapsing into silence, sat in deep sullen thought, until the other soldier came back from the buttery; then, forgetting quite or disregarding his first promise of relieving Bowtell in his turn, he took up the small taper he had brought with him, and left the room in his dark mood, speaking no word to either of the sentinels. CHAPTER VIII. “To hold you in perpetual amity, To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts With an unslipping knot, take Antony Octavia to his wife. * * * * * By this marriage All little jealousies, which now seem great, And all great fears, which now import their dangers, Would then be nothing.” Antony and Cleopatra. Some months had passed after the death of Charles, during which a new form of government had been established. By a vote of the commons the existence of the upper house was declared dangerous and useless, and, without more ado, it was abolished. About the same time, by another vote, monarchy was extinguished, and it was made high treason to proclaim, or otherwise acknowledge, Vol. II.—Q Charles Stuart, commonly called the Prince of Wales, as king of England. A council of state had been next composed, of forty-one members— among whom were Fairfax, Cromwell, Bradshaw, with St. John and the younger Vane—on whom devolved the duties of the executive, with a proviso that they should resign their powers to the state as soon as the republic should be settled on a per manent and stable basis. Some disaffection of the army, and tumults which, for a short time, threatened to be dangerous to the new government, were put down and punished rigorously by the zeal and energy of Cromwell, and all domestic matters wore now a show of happier and fairer promise than Ardenne had ever hoped to witness; while the republic had already been acknowledged, and received the greetings of many—the most powerful potentates of Europe. Spring had grown into early summer; but, while all things around him gradually wore a fuller and more perfect beauty, while buds expanded into full-blown blossoms, and woods put on their freshest garniture of green, and the rich fields gladdened the farmer's heart by their broad promise, the hopes of Ardenne had been blighted more and more, had faded into sorrows, had been seared and dried up into absolute despair. A very few days after the king's execution he had been summoned to repair with speed to Woodleigh, where Sibyl—his beloved — his last and only link to the cold world—was dangerously, if not desperately ill. He found her—as his crushed heart too truly had presaged—already dying. He watched beside her couch, and day by day marked the successive inroads of disease on that dear form! He saw her hourly growiag weaker, paler, and less earthly in her mortal frame; and hourly, as he thought, more heavenly, more angelic in her mind. Between them there was now no estrangement, no distrust. Death, which to ordinary spirits is a separation—death was to them a bond of union. Disguise was at end—both felt, both knew, and both acknowledged that “some wintry blight,” indeed “some casual indisposition,” was the immediate cause of her decline, yet that a pined and broken heart had sapped the corporeal energies, and betrayed the fortress to the insidious spoiler. Sorrow, regret, deep mourning, cast their dark shadows over them, but remorse came not near them— nor reproach—nor any bitter feeling except the sickening sense of hope deferred. Sad though it was and pitiful, it was a lovely scene—that deathbed! The bold and fearless soldier, unmanned utterly, and sobbing like a sickly infant over the wreck of her whom he felt that he now loved better when stricken, blighted, and cut off already from communion with the sons of men, than when she was the pride and admiration of all who chanced to meet her. It has been said already that there was no disguise between them; and now, when every possibility of selfish motives was removed; when there could be no more the slightest misconstruction; when all asperities were, in truth, softened down by the approach of that great alchymist of mortal deeds and mortal causes—death! all that had been before obscure and intricate was rendered plain as noonday. And Sibyl shamed not to confess her sense of her own hapless error, an error which had robbed her lover of all chance of happiness on earth—had robbed herself of life!— and Ardenne, melted and tortured by contrition, and half-repentant, as has been shown already, of the part which he had played, and morbidly dissatisfied with the result of the experiment, sat groaning in the spirit by her pillow, and confessed, in very liopelessness of heart, that he had cast away his all for a mere vision—for a most vain and senseless fancy. But in these bitter moments it was hers, as the true woman's part, still to enact the comforter—to point the real evils, which, while in health and happiness, she scarce would have admitted such, that he had battled to put down—and the more real benefits which must spring up hereafter from the anarchy that had succeeded to the fall of Charles, as darkness follows the decline of day only to bring forth the more pure and mellow moonshine. She died—and Ardenne was, indeed, alone—alone for ever!—without one tie on earth —without one kindred creatore through whose veins the pure blood of his fathers poured its unmingled current—without one selfish hope—without one feeling left that could disturb or alienate his absolute devotion to his country's weal! He looked upon her cold corpse with a tearless eye— he saw the fresh green sod heaped over her—and felt that he had sacrificed his all, and sacrificed it in chase of a phantom! He felt that England was as far from rational and real liberty as at the war's commencement, and how much farther from the blessed calm of an established peace. A cold and bitter mood of grief had fallen on him, obscuring all his brighter qualities, and overpowering the energies of a mind once as elastic and pervading as the tempered steel! It had changed his very soul!—it had made him—even more than all the previous sorrows he had known, the previous perils he had faced, the previous disappointments he had writhed in bearing—an altered—a new man! The brilliant dreams and the warm hopes of youth had faded long ago! The high and noble purposes of middle age—the pure ambition to be a benefactor, not of his countrymen alone, but of the universal human race—the steady longing after an honest and clear fame—the sacred fire of patrioism itself, were now, if not extinct, so chilled and overwhelmed by the dull apathy of settled wo, that it had needed much again to raise them into luminous and active being. It was just when he was the most absorbed in this sad stupor, some three or four days only after the death of his lost Sibyl, that an express arrived to rouse him from his sullen musings among the shades of Woodleigh, which had become once more his own—he being next of kin to his untimely-parted cousin. It was an express from that great man, who, more than ever, now, since the decease of Charles, swayed as he chose the destinies of England, craving his instant presence to confer on matters of the highest import both to themselves and to their country. It is true that, long before this period, Sir Edgar Ardenne had ceased to feel that deep respect and almost veneration which he once had entertained for Cromwell. He had long found his suspicions growing daily and hourly more strong—daily and hourly more confirmed by overt actions. Still, with such wondrous skill and subtlety had the arch-schemer wound along his path, onward, still onward! that it was quite impossible to say at what point of his ascent, or if indeed at all, he had passed the confines of sincerity and patriotism, to enter the stern regions of ambition. That Cromwell at this time enjoyed a power eminently great, and at the same time dangerous, Ardenne could not deny—that he had attained to that power by his own energy was self-apparent—but whether he had framed the course which had exalted him according to the dictates of religion and of conscience, and so found his own high fortunes while seeking but for England's weal; or whether he Q 2 had struggled forward to his own grandeur as his only goal, he could not even now decide. One thing he clearly saw, that the experiment had for the present failed!—that, by the death of Charles, tyranny was indeed put down!—but put down only to be followed by anarchy—or by a tyranny more mighty than the former! But, seeing this, he saw no present way of extrication save through the medium of the very man whom he suspected, whom he feared, the most. He therefore judged it most advisable not to permit the alienation which had been growing up between them to become total; but, keeping a shrewd watch on all his motions, to discover, if possible, what might be his ulterior views, and, so far as his own influence might avail, to keep him in the path of honesty and honour. “He can do more for England than any living man,” he muttered to himself, as, in obedience to the unexpected summons, he shook off his lethargy and set his foot in the stirrup—“he can, beyond all question; and let us hope he will. He had high virtues once no less than wondrous talents; and, certainly, I know not why I should assume it as a fact that they are now extinct. And I—since I have lost all else—since I have worn away the flower of my years—wasted the sweetness of my whole existence in struggling for my country, why should I hesitate to pour out the dregs of an unprized and wearisome existence; why should I doubt to cast away life itself also—a life which only separates me from her —if that my life can profit England? I will—I will, as I have begun, so persevere! Consistency and honour now alone are left to me, and never will I disobey their dictates! A name which, though I never shall transmit to others, I, at least, its last owner, never, never will disgrace!” He took his solitary way to London, and, if not the less sad, was at the least less bitterly absorbed by sorrow; he mingled, with a grave aspect, certainly, and a subdued demeanour, in the chance society of men, and struggled, not all unsuccessfully, to shake off a melancholy which, though it was a luxury to indulge, he felt it was a duty to repress. The third day toward nightfall found him already in the heart of the metropolis, which, under its new masters, wore a composed and steady aspect of society, not, indeed, very gay or pleasing, yet praiseworthy at least for the entire absence of rude revelry or riot in the crowded streets. Ardenne found Cromwell, as when he last had visited him, occupying the royal chambers of Whitehall, but with far more of pomp and show than he had as yet witnessed about the person of the independent leader. Two or three officers, richly attired, waited in the anterooms, and a page, sumptuously though not gayly dressed, opened the door of his apartment to the gallant baronet with deep and silent reverence. The cordial warmth which Oliver exhibited would in itself have called forth something of suspicion from the mind of Sir Edgar; for, latterly, although not absolutely estranged from each other, there had been a passing coldness, a want of frank and cheerful confidence between them, which caused the present alteration of the general's air and manner to be very obvious. But, to confirm his fears, after a short discourse on various matters connected with state policy and questions of the day— “You have not heard, I trow, Sir Edgar,” Cromwell began abruptly, after a little pause, “you have not heard of the new trust the parliament hath now of late conferred on me?—even the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland, with command of the forces needful to crush the embers of this accursed rebellion that yet devours the land!” “I have not,” answered Ardenne. “Have you accepted it?” “Surely I have,” returned the general; “for, of a truth, the commons' house, ay! and the councit of state also, were very urgent! yea! unto the taking no denial! for, at the first, I would have fain denied it. Truly my soul is sick of war and tumult, and would retire to the privacy of humble and domestic life. But, as I say, they would take no denial! and, moreover, after a while, diligently searching the Lord's will, praying myself with earnest zeal, and profiting, too, by the prayers of better men, I have been convinced that my repugnance to this duty was not of the Lord—but a back-sliding rather, and a fainting of the flesh; a yielding to the vain temptations of the world and the devil! It is not for me to draw my hand from off the handle of the plough, when He hath manifestly fixed on me the task of turning up the hard and stubborn glebe.” “A powerful army, doubtless, is assigned to you,” said Ardenne, half musing, half inquiring. “Doubtless! Twelve thousand horse and foot —the picked men of the host, that hath so gloriously worked out the freedom of the land—the regiments and their commanders subject to my own choice! One hundred thousand pounds of sterling silver in the military chest, and all things corresponding! Verily, by the Lord's help, soon shall we have peace as settled in the wildest bog of Ireland as in the heart of London!” “It is a great trust!” Ardenne again answered, coldly, “the greatest for a subject! When set you forth?” “Speedily,” Cromwell replied, “right speedily! —but, ere I go, I have yet one thing to perform— the parliament, as not content with these high honours it hath done me, commands me to appoint all the chief officers. The master of the horse is a high post—important, onerous, and of great weight! Now, Edgar Ardenne, though we have differed somewhat lately, I do know you able, valiant, honest, and trusty—such are the attributes needful for this great office—go with me—it is yours!” “I thank you,” Edgar replied, perfectly unmoved. “Think me not ignorant of the honour, nor yet ungrateful when I decline that honour. In truth, I am sick of blood—blood of my countrymen! I would to God no drop of it had been shed here in England—for I do fear me very much it hath been shed in vain.” Oliver was evidently discomposed; he rose abruptly, and took many turns about the room, muttering to himself; then, stopping suddenly—“Mark me!” he said. “I love you, Edgar Ardenne, I have loved you ever!—yea, since that first night when we met nigh Roysten—I have felt ever that in you there is an honesty different from that of men. You preach not, neither do you pray much in public, yet I do well believe you have more true religion than half the saints of the land. You can fight, too, with the foremost—and counsel better than the wisest! You must go with me! you must strike on my side! Surely the Lord shall yet do greater things for this regenerate land than he hath done already—though wondrous are his works and great his loving-kindness — and it is graven in my heart within me, that by me shall he do them!—although I be but a rough instrument, a blunt and edgeless tool, for his omnipotent right hand! Go with me, now, go with me—and I say not that I will make you great—for, of a truth, it is not for a grovelling worm upon the earth to speak of making earthworms great!— creation is the Lord's, and the Lord's only!—but I do say that my fortunes shall be thy fortunes also! and my hopes thine! Lo! you, I have a daughter—one yet a maid—comely, too, in the flesh—discreet, and virtuous, and sage—even my youngest —Frances! Again! I say not that I will give her to thee in the bonds of wedlock; for, truly, hearts cannot be given and transferred like golden dress—neither do I esteem it wise or lawful for a parent to do any force to those most strong and inward inclinations! But this I will say—for it is a truth, I do profess to you, a very truth!—that I believe the maid hath looked not hitherto on any man to love him—and that, rather than any man on earth, would I see thee my son-in-law! Thine own high qualities, so that the Lord look down upon this work, will do the rest! Give me thine hand; say that thou wilt go with me! surely thou shalt be next in power unto myself—next in the glory of the deeds we shall accomplish in the Lord's qause and England's. Thou shalt see yet, and share in very mighty changes—” “I were dishonest,” Sir Edgar interrupted him, with vehemence, “I were dishonest! a base traitor to my cause, my conscience, and my country, did I pretend to doubt your meaning! I read you, sir, I read you as you were an open book before me—but me you know not, nor can comprehend at all! Neither—great as you are, and greater as you wish to be—can you tempt me one inch from the straight path! My heart, General Cromwell, is in the grave!—in the grave with that peerless woman who once, at your hands, saved me from a father's madness! Not—not to be a queen's—an angel's husband, would I forego the memory of her on earth—the hope of her in Heaven! As for what you call greatness, I care not for it—nay, I do loathe it!—for it is villany—dishonour—shame! Farewell! I leave you, sir, in sorrow—in strong and bitter sorrow! Fairly I tell you to your face. I do suspect you very deeply—and if it be as I suspect, I will oppose you to the death! Pause! pause—and oh! consider!—it is a little thing to be a king!—a tyrant!—a usurper! It is the mightiest of all things to have the power to be so, and the virtue to decline that power! Be, as you may, your country's friend, its guardian, and its father! Beware! I say, beware how you attempt to be its ruler! Better is a pure conscience than a golden bawble! He who cannot err hath said, `What shall it avail a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul!' You say you love me—I did once love—honour—esteem—ay! venerate you— you, Oliver Cromwell! and rather would I hew off the best limb of my body than see you play the part which I do fear you meditate! Answer me not, sir! no profession can convince me. Actions—actions, sir—actions only can prove to me your truth. Sincerely I pray God that I may be in error— sincerely I pray God you may be strengthened to cast temptation far behind you—to be the great, the glorious, the immortal benefactor of your land, you may be if you will! Go, then, to Ireland—go —do your duty; I will adhere to mine. My sword is in its scabbard, never to come forth more unless my country shall require it against a foreign foe! or—a domestic tyrant! Farewell! may Heaven give you strength—farewell!” “Do we part friends?” asked Oliver, whose strong nerves were greatly shaken, and whose mind, wholly impassable at ordinary moments to such feelings, was penetrated by a sense of absolute humiliation, and overpowered by the sublime and genuine force of real virtue; “do we part friends?” “And shall, I trust, meet friends!” Edgar replied, clasping his hand with fervour, while a tear stood in his dark eye. “You have no truer friend! —no more sincere admirer—be but yourself—within the four seas that gird Britain! May Heaven protect you, and preserve you—as I have thought you—as I would think you ever—noble!” Again he grasped his hand, wrung it hard, turned, and left the room. “Can it be so?” cried Cromwell, in a low thoughtful tone, “can it be so?—and hath he read my inward soul—read it more truly than myself?” He strode across the room with a loud step and a kingly port. “Not king—but the first man in England! Ha!” but again his proud glance sank, his firm step faltered, and he struck his bosom with the eager violence of passionate repentance. “Avaunt!—avaunt!—get thee behind me!—no! no! he erred!—he erred!—yet had he wellnigh made me deem myself a villain! `Not king, but the first man in England!' Well, first in virtue! —first in sincere god-seeking piety!—first, it may be, in good report—which men call fame!—in the Lord's favour, and the people's love! But not— not first in power, or wealth, or rank! Not first, as that bold Ardenne said, in villany! No! no! he erred, and I am sound at heart—my breast is proof to thy devices! Avaunt, thou crafty devil! I am strong—strong—strong in virtue!” He saw not Ardenne any more for many a year of peril and success—of labour and of sin—and of the world's arch phantom—glory! But six days afterward Edgar beheld him, seated in his coach of state, dragged by six stately horses, tossing their plumed heads and shaking their superb caparisons as proudly as though they were conscious of the freight they drew along the crowded streets. He marked the quiet air of exultation and of triumph that sat on his firm lip and glanced from his deep eye! He noted the unwonted splendour!—the gorgeous dresses and accoutrements of his lifeguard—eighty young men — majors and colonels of the army, mounted more splendidly than the pretorian band of any king in Europe; sheathed in bright steel, with waving plumes, and floating scarfs, and all the bravery of the cavaliers! He saw the haughty bearing of his son Henry—his lieutenant and master of the horse!—he saw the soldiery, in their magnificent array, trooping along, with their proud banners flaunting in the summer sunshine, and the triumphant clangour of their military music waking the merriest echoes behind their adored leader!—and, above all, he heard the thundering acclamations of the multitude as that pomp swept along!—and, with a heavy sigh, he turned from that sight in all other eyes so glorious and majestic—a sigh for Cromwell's fame!—a sigh for England's peace!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dearest and best Marie— “I have received your kind and most consoling letter of July from the tried friend who bore it. The wisdom of your counsels I acknowledge, and, so far as in me lies, will follow them. But, trust me, girl, better and brighter days are yet in store for us. I do assure you I am even now more king —more powerful and free—than ere I raised my standard; so that I doubt not, with a little patience and a small share of finesse, all shall be yet as we would have it. I am now courted by all parties— English and Scottish—Presbyterians, Independents —parliament and army—all prostrate at my feet— all rivals for my favour, and balanced, too, so equally, that whom I join soever carries the day. In truth, chiefly do I incline toward the Scots, but, for the present, seem, for my own purposes, to favour more the army. In the end, whosoe bids the highest has me. You disapprove, you tell me, my `promising so much to those two villains, Ireton and Cromwell.' Now, I beseech you, be not alarmed nor troubled; but leave me to manage, who am informed far better of all circumstances than you by any means can be; and on this head rest altogether easy, for in due season I shall know how to deal with these rogues, who, for a silken garter, shall be fitted with a hempen rope! This by a mode that can by no chance fail; where, fore, though briefly—as my space compels—I yet write plainly. If all things prosper with me, as I have now good cause to deem they will—for all the factions, themselves cozened, look on the others as outwitted—I shall once more embrace the well-beloved queen and mistress of my heart, greater and far more powerful than ever, ere many months shall pass, in our own palace of Whitehall. “Until the Lord, in his good time, shall bring which things to pass, “Your loving husband and idolater, “C.

      <field name="fulltext">CROMWELL. BOOK IV. “Now could I, Casca, Name to thee a man most like this night, That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars As doth the lion in the Capitol; A man no mightier than thyself, or me. In personal action; yet prodigious grown, And fearful, as these strange eruptions are. Casca. 'Tis Cæsar that you mean: is it not, Cassius?” Shakspeare—Julius Cœsar, CHAPTER I. “And Dunbar field resounds thy praises loud.” Milton's Sonnets. The stubborn spearmen still made good Their dark impenetrable wood, Each stepping where his comrade stood, The instant that he fell. No thought was there of dastard flight; Linked in the serried phalanx tight, Groom fought like noble, squire like knight, As fearlessly and well.” Marmion. Once more upon the charger's back! once more among the trumpets! A year had passed since Cromwell, invested with his new dignity of lord-lieutenant, landed in Dublin Bay—a year — during the course of which his arms, attended everywhere by victory, and edged by deadly vengeance, had swept like a tornado over devoted Ireland. Her strongest holds were levelled to the dust, piles of fire-blackened stones quenched with the life-blood of their massacred defendants. It was a year of merciless destruction — of unsparing, indiscriminating slaughter—a year which cast a deep stain on the name of Cromwell, never before attainted by the dark charge of cruelty—a year the miseries of which were such that they have branded that name on the memories of the Irish with such imperishable hate, that, even to this day, their direst malediction is, “the curse of Cromwell be upon you.” From his career of victory and havoc Oliver was recalled, in the earlier months of '50, to return to England and oppose the Prince of Wales, who, having landed in the north, had been proclaimed and crowned the King of Scots, and, at the head of a large army, was preparing to assert his rights. With his accustomed energy, he instantly appointed Ireton his lord deputy and Ludlow his lieutenant of the horse, delegating all his powers to them, and leaving them to finish what he had so effectually set in motion; and in a very short space was in London to receive the parliament's instructions. Here he was welcomed with the highest honours and rewards; and, after some delay, owing to the refusal of Lord Fairfax, who was himself of that persuasion, to command against the Scottish Presbyterians—a refusal which, with much urgency, and, it would seem, with real and unfeigned sincerity, Oliver strove to combat— set forth, invested with the supreme command of the land forces of the parliament, to crush, as was expected, at a single blow, the power of the Scottish royalists, and lead the second Charles in triumph to the footstool of the proud republicans, or to expel him from the kingdom of his fathers a despairing fagitive. In this their overweening confidence, however, the English government were for a time disappointed; for, having crossed the Tweed, and advanced almost to the walls of Edinburgh before the last days of July, their general was so far from gaining any real or definitive advantage, that, after two or three smartly-contested skirmishes, and much manœuvring against the veteran Lesley, who resolutely declined a general action, he was compelled, R 2 by want of forage and provisions, to reship five hundred of his men from Musselburgh for Berwick, and with the remnant—described by one of his best officers as “a poor, shattered, hungry and discouraged army”—to fall back in some confusion on Dunbar, where he might be supported by his fleet and storeships. Having been pressed so closely by the Scottish horse on his retreat from Musselburgh to Haddington that he was at one time in much danger—his rear-guard, which had been outstripped by the centre and advance, being exposed for a short time to the chance of an attack from the whole power of the Scots—by favour of a misty night he arrived within a few miles of Dunbar late in the evening of the first day of September. On the morning of the second, Oliver's army lying in a low swampy plain, with an exhausted country in their rear, a mountainous ridge held by a superior force in front, a stormy and tempestuous sea upon their right, and the weather such as to prevent any communication with the fleet, scarce any situation can be fancied more desperate and appalling than that of the invaders. Throughout that morning he saw the host of Lesley holding the hill with resolute determination, in a position of such formidable strength that he himself has mentioned it as one wherein `ten men were better to hinder than a hundred to make way.' Below this hill was a small narrow plain, running down on the right hand to the sea, between the ridge then occupied by Lesley and a deep cleugh or dell, through which a rapid and impetuous stream found its way to the German Ocean, into which it falls at Broxmouth Park. But, toward evening, he perceived a movement in the hostile lines, and, shortly afterward, a mighty shout rang on his ears. Immediately he leaped upon his horse, and, galloping forth with a handful of his chosen guard, rode to the brink of the ravine, from which he might behold the Scottish ranks pouring tumultuously down from their commanding station into that narrow strip whereon their very numbers would but operate against themselves, vociferously calling on their officers to “lead them down to Ramoth Gilead that they might slay the foe—even the blasphemous accursed Philistine!” For a while he gazed steadily upon them without speaking; and, by the curl upon his lip, and the deep sneer of his expressive nostril, many of those around him fancied that he saw and detected some deep purpose in the hostile movement; but when band after band came rushing down, column on column of dark pikemen—brigade after brigade of guns—and, finally, the horse and the reserve, with Scotland's royal banner, shouting, “The sword of the Lord and of Gideon”—their favourite war-cry—the gloom which had sat upon his brow for many days passed suddenly and was succeeded by a wild gleam of joy. “The Lord,” he cried, flinging his arm aloft, and giving the spur to his charger till he plunged and bolted from the earth—“the Lord of Hosts—he hath delivered them into mine hands!” and—while the numbers of the Scottish, vastly superior to his own, and ten times more than could be marshalled fittingly upon that battle-ground, were drawing up, as best they might, their crowded and disordered ranks where they had neither room to fight, nor any way by which to fly if routed—he coolly reconnoitred the ravine, passable only at one point, and that, though pervious even to artillery, a rugged ford, between steep banks, shadowed with timber-trees, and domineered by earthy mounds scarped naturally by the wintry floods. Having determined instantly, in his own mind, on an attack en masse upon the morrow, he ordered an advanced guard of horse and foot to occupy this all-important station—selected nine of his best regiments to force the passage at the earliest dawn of day—and then, announcing his design to his assembled officers in council, and ordering all things to be in preparation for the attack with the first glimmering of the east, threw himself down on his camp bed without removing any part of his attire, and slept so soundly that his attendants had no easy task to rouse him from his dreamless and untroubled slumbers when the appointed hour had arrived. Ere he was in the saddle day had dawned fully; and then, having relied on Lambert for the due execution of the orders on which his plan depended, he galloped to the front, expecting to find all in readiness, and wondering that his artillery was not yet heard, covering the passage of his troops. He reached the advanced lines, and all was in confusion. During the night, Lesley, aware of the importance of that point, had utterly cut off the guard detached for the defence of the ravine—so utterly, indeed, that not a soldier had escaped to bear the tidings of defeat to his superiors—and occupied it with a force equal at least to that which Cromwell had appointed to oppose him. The sky was gray already, but the approach of morning was delayed, or, at the least, obscured by a thick mist arising from the seaboard, and spreading over the flat land on which both armies had slept upon their weapons in grim preparation for the coming strife. A powerful horse-regiment, which had been chosen to advance the foremost, was in the very act of passing—some having crossed the stream, and now laboriously struggling up the banks on the Scotch side, and the rest even now battling with the heavy current, when a tremendous fire of musketry and ordnance was poured upon them while in confusion; and when, despite this fearful obstacle, they forced the pass, they were charged instantly, and thrown into disorder by a brigade of cuirassiers appointed for this duty by the veteran Lesley. While they were fighting with a desperate obstinacy, that, had they been relieved or re-enforced, would even yet have rendered them victorious, the infantry, who, in advancing to support them, had suffered terribly by the well-served artillery of the Presbyterians, were in their turn charged, broken, and pushed back across the clough by the pike-regiments, which then, as in all former periods, composed the pride and strength of the Scotch host. Just at this moment Cromwell reached a small eminence that overlooked the scene—he saw his scheme well-nigh frustrated; one of his best brigades of horse almost annihilated—his infantry repulsed—his attack not merely disappointed, but on the very point of being turned against himself—and all this time Lambert, his major-general, had not brought up a single gun, much less attempted to assist the charge or cover the retreat of his defeated squadrons. A dark red flush rose to his cheek, his brow!—his eye flashed lurid fire—as he dashed up to the artillerists, fiercely commanding them, with a voice tremulous and hoarse from ire—“To shoot sharply and upon the instant, or, as the Lord Jehovah liveth, ye shall swing from these oaks ere the sun rises.” Awed by his threats and stimulated by his presence, they struggled nobly to redeem their error—gun after gun belched forth its cloud of smoke and flame, and the shot plunged, with accurate aim and awful execution, into the serried masses of the Scotch, enabling the discomfited and shattered cavalry to draw off and repass the stream. “Ride for your life,” cried Oliver to one, the nearest, of his staff, “and bring up my pike-regiment—mine own, I say—under the trusty Goff! and Jepherson's horse-squadrons, and Lumley's musketeers! Ride—ride, I tell thee, on the spur! And thou,” he added, “away to Lambert, Kingsland; let him bring up more guns—more guns!” and, too impatient to await the execution of his orders in quiet inactivity, he galloped furiously, attended only by a slender staff and captain's guard of cuirassiers, down to the steep banks of the ford. There he stood, coolly gazing on the advancing ranks of Lesley, a mark for the artillery, and even for the small arms of the Scottish; the balls from which shivered the trees and tore the ground about him, but harmed not, strange to say, either himself or any of the little group behind. It was, indeed, a critical conjuncture—a stout division of field-guns was whirled up, at the speed of powerful and active horses, to the brink opposite the very spot where Cromwell stood!— and now they were unlimbered!—and now, with matches lighted, the cannoneers were busily engaged directing them toward him! Then, from the dark and wooded gorge beneath, a prolonged flourish of their trumpets announced the presence of the enemy; who now, the independents having been forced back bodily from their position, were crowding down, in numbers almost irresistible, in their turn to attempt the passage. The eye of Cromwell for the first time grew anxious, and his lip quivered visibly, as with the blast the heavy tramp of the advancing pikemen was heard above the ripple of the water, and the bright heads of their long weapons were seen glimmering above the mistwreaths which partially obscured the ranks that bore them. A mounted officer dashed up to him, spoke a few hurried words, and, ere the gloom had cleared from Cromwell's brow, the steady march of his own regiment fell joyously upon his ear! They halted, as the heads of their long files came up, abreast of their commander; while, with their matches ready lighted, six hundred musketeers, under the gallant Lumley, hastened to line the hither verge, availing themselves of every crag or stunted bush whereby to hide themselves, and whence to pour their unseen volleys on the host below. With a few words, fiery, and terse, and full of that enthusiastic confidence which had so wonderfully gained the hearts of all that followed him, Oliver now addressed his chosen veterans. In deep, and, as it might seem, sullen silence, they attended while he spoke; but, as he ended, such a shout arose as startled Lesley's host and roused them from their dreams of victory. “Oliver! Oliver! hurrah!” and, with the words, they rushed down headlong on the spears of the advancing foe, shouting their cry—“The Lord! the Lord of Hosts!” Meanwhile the musketry of Lumley was not silent!—bright, bright, and quick it flashed from every gray stone — every bracken bush—and every tuft of broom that fringed those broken banks!—and, to increase the din, ten guns, which Lambert, wakened at length to energy, wheeled up at the full gallop, opened their fire upon the feebler ordnance of the Scottish, killing the cannoneers, dismounting their light pieces, and silencing, after a single ill-directed volley, their fruitless effort. Taken thus absolutely by surprise, the Presbyterian squadrons reeled in their turn—and louder from the depths of the ravine arose that awful shout, “The Lord! the Lord of Hosts!” as, through the waters, whose dark current—dark with human gore—flowed feebly now, choked and obstructed with the bodies of the dead and dying, that irresistible and never-conquered band charged onward, bearing the felics of the enemy before them, with shrick, and yell, and execration, up! up! at the pike's point! up to the level ground whence, flushed with hope of easy triumph, they had but now descended—and still the well-aimed shot of Lumley's skirmishers fell thick among the flyers. With half a glance Cromwell perceived—and with him to perceive was instantly to profit by the moment of advantage. Putting himself at the head of Jepherson's brigade of ironsides, which came up at a rapid trot just as Goff's pikemen were appearing on the farther brow, brandishing high in air his formidable rapier, and pointing with a grim smile to the strife raging and reeling opposite, he spurred his charger down the bank! Two bounds bore him across the chasm, and, with a louder clang of corslet, spur, and scabbard than had resounded yet that day, down rushed those zealot horsemen! The morning hitherto had been dull, gloomy, and dispiriting; but, as the leader of the ironsides spurred his black charger up the steep ascent, and paused an instant there—a breathing statue, bolder, and nobler, and more massively majestic than any sculpture from the inspired chisel of the Greek!— contemplating the features of the already half-gained battle—for from their right wing to their centre the whole army of the covenanters, crowded together and unable to manœuvre, was reeling to and fro in most tumultuous disarray—just at that instant the mist bodily soared upward, and the broad glorious sunlight streamed out rejoicingly, kindling up all the field of battle and the rich valley to the right, and the superb expanse of the wide German Ocean, now calm and cradling on its azure bosom the friendly vessels of the commonwealth, that loomed like floating castles through the dispersing fog. It was a wonderful—a spirit-stirring change—and he who witnessed its effects the first, inspired by the sublimity of what he looked upon, struck by a thought no less sublime, cried out, flinging his arm aloft in proud anticipation of his coming triumph—“Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered!” The aspect of the man, rising, as it were, suddenly from out the bowels of the earth—the stern composure of his halt—the simultaneous outburst of the sunbeams—and, above all, the wonderful quotation, delivered in a voice so loud as to be heard by hundreds of both hosts, and yet so passionless and clear as to strike every heart with something of that awe which would attach to aught miraculous—completed what the ordinary means of warfare had so well commenced. Their broadswords flashing in the newly-risen beams, and their united voices pealing forth, as it were by inspiration, the apt words of their leader, the ironsides swept onward to the charge!—and, without pause or hesitation, catching enthusiasm from the cries of those who went before—regiment after regiment of the invaders poured unopposed over the perilous chasm; and, forming as they reached the level ground, plunged in with shot of arquebuss and push of pike upon the wavering masses, that could now offer only an inert resistance to their impetuous onset. For a short time the native valour of the Scots supported them after their flank was turned, and their whole line confused and shaken beyond all hope of restoration!—for a short time they stood firm with their serried spears—shoulder to shoulder—foot to foot-when one man fell, another stepping instantly into his place—and only ceasing to resist when all had ceased to live. But, charged front, flank, and rear, by horse and foot, pell-mell, Vol. II.—S the cannon-shot making huge gaps in their dense columns, it was impossible that they, or any, should hold out. They broke—they scattered— they retreated not, but fled—in wild and irretrievable dismay—pursued, cut down, and slaughtered by the fresh cavalry of Cromwell, who for eight miles had execution of the flyers!—while the triumphant general, calling a halt when he perceived the battle won, sang, with his zealot legions swelling the stormy chorus, the hundred and seventeenth Psalm, in honour of that Lord who, as he said, “after the first repulse, had given up his enemies as stubble to the strong arms and the victorious weapons of his own elected people.” CHAPTER II. “And Worcester's laureate wreath.” Milton's Sonnets. “No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost. * * * The king himself Of his wings destitute, the army broken, And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying Through a strait lane; the enemy full-hearted, Lolling the tongue with slaughtering.” Cymbeline. For several months after the battle of Dunbar both parties rested in comparative inaction. Edinburgh castle, after a brief siege, was surrendered by Dundas, without, indeed, if the assertions of the royalists are to be credited, any sufficient reason. During the winter Oliver remained in the metropolis of Scotland, engaged, for the most part, in disputations with the Presbyterian clergy, who hated him with bitter and incessant rancour; and here he was attacked by a sharp fit of ague, threatening to undermine his constitution, and actually reducing him so low that it was early in July before he was prepared to take the field. Meanwhile, Charles had been crowned at Perth, on the first day of January, '51, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, most of the nobles being present in their robes of state and coronets—had sworn both to the “National Covenant” and to the “League and Covenant”—had levied a strong army under command of the stout veteran Lesley—and had taken post, meaning to act on the defensive, on strong ground in the neighbourhood of Torwood. Here for some days the hostile armies faced each other, manœuvring to gain, if possible, advantages that might ensure success—Oliver continually desiring, Lesley as obstinately shunning, any contact that might lead to a general action. Skirmishes occurred almost every day between the cavalry and outposts — but none of much importance, whether from loss sustained or permanent results on the campaign; till, at last, wearied by a game in which he had sagacity to see that he in the long run must be the loser, Cromwell transported his whole army into Fife, besieging and in two days making himself the master of the town of Perth. His object in this bold manœuvre was to draw down the Scottish army from its ground of vantage, and in this he succeeded fully, though not, perhaps, exactly in the manner he had contemplated; for, breaking up his camp at Torwood on the thirty-first, Charles turned his face toward the border, loading some twelve or fourteen thousand men, with the intent of concentrating his powers at Carlisle, where he expected to be re-enforced by a great rising of the royalists en masse from all the northern counties. The consternation throughout England at the news of this advance was general and excessive—the parliament were in extremity of terror and suspicion—Bradshaw himself, stout-hearted as he was in public, privately owned his fears, and more than half suspected the good faith of Cromwell. Their terrors grew more and more real daily, when it was told in London that the cavaliers of Lancashire were gathering head under Lord Derby, and the Presbyterians threatening to make common cause with them under their Major-general Massey; and, in good sooth, had it not been for the insane fanaticism of the Scottish clergy—who, with a fierce intolerance that ruined their own cause, would suffer none to join the standard of the king without subscribing to the covenant— the forces of the royalists would have been truly formidable, and might have, not improbably, succeeded in restoring Charles to his ancestral throne. But, happily for England, hundreds of gallant cavaliers and hundreds of stout-hearted English Presbyterians were refused the miserable boon of sacrificing life and fortune in behalf of the least grateful prince of an ungrateful line, because, forsooth, they would not sacrifice the interests also of their native land to the intolerant and selfish policy of Scotland. Still, though his ranks swelled not as rapidly as, under a more prudent system, they would assuredly have done, Charles marched with little opposition, and still less real loss, as far into his southern kingdom as the fair town of Worcester. Lilburne, indeed, with a small independent party, surprised and utterly defeated, at Wigan-lane, in Lancashire, three or four hundred gentlemen commanded by the Earl of Derby; who, himself desperately wounded, escaped with difficulty from falling into the hands of his rude conquerors! Lambert and Harrison attempted, with inferior forces, to dispute the passage of the Mersey with the king; but, after a few ineffectual charges, and offering Charles an opportunity of bringing on a general action, were forced to draw off, and permit the enemy to enter Worcester unmolested. Here he was instantly proclaimed, amid the acclamations of the mob and the good wishes, faint though faithful, of the loyal gentlemen assembled in that city. While tarrying here it became visible to Charles and his advisers that succour came not in by any means so rapidly as they had hoped; that the Welsh cavaliers, who had been most severely handled in their last insurrections, were not disposed to risk a general rising; and that there was but little hope of any common or extensive movement of the royalists until some such advantage should be gained as would, at least, be a justification to their daring. In this predicament it was decided that they should await Cromwell's arrival from the north, and give him battle there beneath the walls of Worcester. Nor, indeed, had they long to tarry; for, with his wonted energy of mind and motion, that able leader had pursued the footsteps of his enemy, so that, within a very few days of the king's arrival, the various detachments of the pursuing army concentrated on the Severn, and on the twenty-eighth of August Oliver joined in person, and found at his disposal not less than thirty thousand soldiers of all arms, regular troops and militia both enumerated. No sooner were the hostile armies face to face than skirmishes, in which there was much desperate fighting and much loss on both sides, commenced and were continued daily. Lambert, after a well-disputed contest, carried the bridge at Upton, and established his position, Massey having been wounded so severely as S 2 to be wellnigh hors de combat. The Scots, on the first day of September, destroyed two bridges on the Team about three miles from Worcester, and the second was consumed in preparations for reestablishing the communication. Late on that evening Oliver dismounted from his charger at headquarters, and issued his directions, brief, luminous, and rapid, for the morrow—which, he reminded his high-spirited but superstitious officers, was his peculiar day of glory—“A day whereon, from his childhood, by the Lord's wondrous grace, up to that present time, he never had attempted aught but he had therefrom reaped a golden harvest. Wherefore,” he said, “let us fall on more boldly— mindful of the last anniversary which saw the glorious blessing at Dunbar—and putting trust in our own stout right arms, and in the aid of that Lord who is all in all—trusting, I say, that this shall prove a final and decisive end to our labours—yea! and a crowning mercy!” Fleetwood was then commanded to force the passage of the Team at noon, when they supposed the cavaliers would have abandoned any thoughts of a decisive action for that day, while Cromwell should himself establish a bridge of boats across the Severn at Bunshill. The morning of the third broke gloriously and bright. The independent forces were full of ardour for the onset, inflamed even beyond their wont by the prophetic exhortations of their leader, who, himself kindling like a warhorse to the trumpets, proclaimed to them, no longer darkly nor in doubtful hints, but in wild glowing eloquence, that they should now ride forth to glory!—that their right hands should teach them terrible things—that they should smite the sons of Zeruiah utterly, and suffer not a man of them to live. At the appointed hour Fleetwood attacked in force, and, after a most furious cannonade, carried the passage of the Team, and was already strengthening his position, when Charles, alarmed by the incessant firing, despatched strong re-enforcements to support his friends, with orders at all hazards to prevent a bridge from being formed. Again the action became hot and doubtful—and now the independents were forced back, although fighting foot by foot, before the masses of the royalists; but just when these imagined their success decisive, Fleetwood in turn was re-enforced, and, acting with a fiery daring, that was well seconded by his stout veterans, charged instantly along his whole line, and repulsed the Scots. Those sturdy troops, however, rallied instantly, thus hoping to afford their countrymen a chance of breaking Cromwell's regiments on the other side of the Severn. The ground on which they fought, though for the most part level, was intersected everywhere by thick strong fences of old thorn, with banks and ditches; and each of these positions was lined with musketry, and was defended with an obstinate and dogged courage that cost the independents hundreds on hundreds of their bravest soldiers. One by one they were forced, however, at the pike's point; and still, as Fleetwood's men advanced, the Scotch pike-regiments rushed on, charging with more of spirit than they had displayed throughout the whole course of the war; and still, when forced to give way, leisurely and in perfect order falling back to the next fence, which was by this time glancing with the sharp volleys of their musketeers. But, notwithstanding all their efforts, ere nightfall they were driven from their every line with unexampled loss—beaten at every point—and forced to seek for refuge in the walls of Worcester. On the other side the river the battle raged with equal fury and almost equal doubtfulness during five hours at the least. Cromwell, who had, from a flying battery of heavy guns, commenced a cannonade upon the fort built to defend the main gate of the town, and brought up all his forces in two lines to assault the place, was charged at all points by a general sally of the whole infantry of the king's army, who, issuing simultaneously from several gates, firing and cheering till the welkin rang as they came on, burst on the newly-levied regiments and the militia with such enthusiastic valour, that they drove them back in absolute confusion, took Cromwell's battering guns, and turned them with effect on his disordered squadrons. But at this juncture Charles was unequal to the great part which he had to play; had he brought out his cavalry, and charged again while the militia of the independents were forced pell-mell into the ranks of the reserve, he hardly could have failed of gaining a complete victory. But his horse, save one squadron, were within the city—he saw his error when it was too late, for the keen eye of Cromwell saw it likewise, and gave him not a second's space even to struggle to redeem it. Leading his cavalry—his own invincibles—at a quick trot, in squadrons, through the intervals of the defeated regiments, he set up one of his triumphant hymns, and, sweeping on like a springtide, with full five thousand horse, he beat the victors back—regained the cannon, sabring the artillerists over their guns --and, while his cavalry reformed, brought up the whole of his reserve—the conquerors of Marston, Naseby, and Dunbar—column on column—with a succession of tremendous charges that no troops then in the world could have resisted! Scarce had his musketry and pikemen shattered the Scottish masses ere he again came thundering down on them with his unrivalled horse. And back! back! they were borne, hopelessly, irretrievably defeated. Still they had steadiness enough to retreat corps by corps, facing and firing till all were within the walls who had the power to crawl into that too precarious place of refuge. The last beams of the setting sun glanced red and lurid on the weapons of the last band that filed into the gates—a feeble cheer arose! and then a heavy cannonade ensued from the whole line of battlements, compelling Oliver to draw his forces off for a short space of relaxation and repose. Short space it was, however; for twilight was yet lingering upon that fatal plain when Cromwell's trumpets summoned the fortress to surrender. The summons was refused, and instantly a dozen rockets rushed up to the darkening sky—the batteries opened for ten minutes space more furiously than ever—and then, with Cromwell personally leading them on sword in hand, with an apalling shout, the forlorn hope rushed forward—with ladders, and fascines, and boarding-axe, and pike, and every instrument most fearfully destructive, they hurried to the walls, which now, from every porthole, battlement, and embrasure, poured forth the ringing volleys of the ordnance. Scarcely ten minutes passed, however, before the cannon again ceased— and the loud roar of thousands, blent with the maddened shrieks of women, and all the horrid noises of a captured city, announced that all was over. The gates were instantly thrown open, and in poured the furious zealots; throughout the livelong night the din, and rage, and agony, and sacrilege continued; full fifteen hundred men were slaughtered in the streets; the thoroughfares were choked with corpses, the kennels ran knee-deep with human gore. The morning of the fourth arose, like that of the preceding day, serene and glorious. The massacre was checked, peace was restored, and, at the least, comparative tranquillity; the king was a despairing fugitive, with scarce a hope remaining even of personal escape; his army was annihilated—his party was no more — his friends slaughtered or hopeless captives — his kingdom numbered, weighed, divided, and apportioned!— and with a steady countenance, lighted by no fiery exultation, the winner returned praises to the Giver of all goodness for this HIS CROWNING MERCY! CHAPTER III. “Thou, who with thy frown Annihilated senates.” Childe Horold. “Can tyrants but by tyrants conquer'd be, And freedom find no champion and no child Such as Columbia saw arise, when she Sprung forth a Pallas, armed and undefiled?” Ibid. By that one blow the empire of the parliament was confirmed through every corner of Great Britain—the last hope of the Stuarts was in the dust, never, as it seemed, more to rise—and he, the conqueror, was received in the metropolis as no scion of a royal stock had ever yet been greeted! Congratulations, not of tongue-loyalty, but of sincere and grateful love, were showered upon him, as he drove into London in a gorgeous carriage, escorted by the speaker and the leading members of the commons—the mayor and sheriffs of the city—and an enormous multitude of every age and sex, who had gone out to Acton to show their gratitude and reverence to one whom many thought it no flattery to term the father and the saviour of his country. A lodging was assigned to him in the late residence of England's monarch!—a solemn vote of thanks was tendered to him, all the members standing, when he resumed his seat!—petitions, couched in humbler language and decked with loftier adulation than any sovereign since Elizabeth had received from his subjects, were sent up to him daily!—his praises were hymned forth by a lyre, whose melody shall never be forgotten while England's language lives upon the earth—the lyre of the immortal Milton! Although no king, Cromwell was, truly, the first man in England. Modestly, however, and decorously, and without any symptom of disorganizing or misproud ambition, did he bear his high honours. Wisdom and mercy marked his elevation in no less degree than energy and valour signalized his rise. His first act in the senate of the regenerated land was to obtain the passing of a general amnesty in the behalf of all who had engaged in the late war, with the exception only of some two or three, so obstinately and incurably devoted to the exiled family and hostile to the commonwealth, that public safety rendered their public punishment a measure not of cruelty or vengeance, but of necessity. His next was to procure a vote for taking speedily into consideration the expediency of fixing a time for their own dissolution. The period named accordingly for the abdication of their immense, and, thus far, well-exerted powers, was the third day of November, 1654—a distance of three years—a distance neither justified by any rule or precedent of the constitution, nor anywise desirable or necessary—but proving merely that having, by their exertions in past time, put down the tyranny established on the abuse of prerogative, they were determined now to build another on the more popular but scarce less perilous abuse of privilege. Having originally met in the year `40, they had already held the reins of government for a far longer time than any former parliament— than would have been endured in times less turbulent—than was, in short, consistent with the rules of sound and equitable policy. Having originally been composed of the best, the wisest, the most independent men of England, they had been gradually, but continually, reduced by death, desertion, and proscription, to a mere knot of party politicians, possessing nothing of a parliament except the name, desirous solely of their own emolument and power, and as entirely different from that magnificent assembly which had resisted the first Charles in all the terrors of his puissant sovereigaty, as it is possible for one deliberative body to be different from another. This, then, was the house which now passed a vote securing to themselves the supreme power of the realm for three more years at least, in absolute defiance to the wishes of the people, of the army, and of the wisest patriots of the kingdom. Scotland, meantime, subdued completely by the arms of Cromwell, wielded by Monk, his able deputy, was in a state of orderly and calm tranquillity widely at variance with the confused and hopeless anarchy in which it had been plunged for centuries by the fierce and continual rivalry of its dogmatic and intolerant sectarians. These had been now, at length, by the wise energy of Oliver, compelled to endure one another peacefully, and to forbear the angry disputations that had incessantly convulsed the country since the first era of the reformation. Ireland, unhappy Ireland, desolated by the fierce vengeance of the independent conquerors, was perforce quiet; and England, united, free, and wealthy, required only a short interval of time, under a firm and liberal government, to recover from the injuries which intestine discord must bring upon a state, how great soever may have been the benefits acquired by the means of the keen remedy, which is to nations as amputation to the human frame. Abroad, her navies rode the ocean in triumphant, if not undisputed, mastery; baffling at every fresh encounter, and subduing the brave and dogged Hollanders, who had so lately ploughed the narrow seas with brooms at their mastheads, as though they would have swept their island foemen from their path like worthless dust!—bringing in unresisted rich and gallant prizes of the volatile and fiery Frenchman, who dared not, so had the genius of the proud republic overcrowed the spirit of that valiant nation, offer resistance to that people now, which they had set at naught while governed by a king!—winning respect from the cold and haughty Spaniard!—making her fame as universal, and her flag as widely known, as winds could blow or billows bear!—and justifying the high boast of Oliver, which he had uttered years before to Ardenne, while yet an undistinguished member in the great council of the kingdom, that the time should come wherein the quality of Englishmen should be as widely and as greatly honoured as ever was the name of antique Roman. It was, then, evident that there was now no cause of fear which should in any degree sanction the continued usurpation, for such indeed it was, of the parliamentarian party, who seemed at this time to have again determined on trying the same line Vol. II.—T of measures which had failed so signally before the death of the first Charles. Yet the commencement of the year 1652 found them still struggling to maintain the sway in absolute despite of their constituents. At this time England had been, for nearly four years, under the nominal form of a republic. The merit of successive parliaments and unbiased representation was on all sides acknowledged, yet was no step taken or even contemplated toward the establishment of such forms, or to the self-dissolution of the present house. Month after month matters continued thus, until another year had wellnigh joined its predecessor in that great catacomb — the past!—the country was dissatisfied!—the army waxed indignant, the rather so that—as before, in the year '49 —foreseeing the determined opposition of the soldiery to their unlawful measures, the commons once again began to agitate the subjects of retrenchment of expenses and the disbanding of one half the standing forces. Thus things went on, all prosperous abroad, all turbulent at home and dubious, until the month of August in the second year after the defeat of Worcester. At this time the leaders of the army, which had now reached the “very winter of their discontent,” presented a petition of the host, by means of a deputation of six officers, the devoted friends of Cromwell, the boldest and most uncompromising favourers of universal freedom in elections and universal toleration—papistry alone excluded—in religious matters. A council had been held some days before at Lenthall's house of all the most important personages of the land, civil and military; whereat it was debated gravely, whether it would be better to perpetuate the commonwealth on terms to be fixed now immutably, or to establish once again the government as vested in a limited mixed monarchy. The officers in general were adverse to all form of royalty, as holding the name “king,” alone and in itself, subversive of true freedom! The lawyers, on the other hand, with the sage Whitelocke at their head, maintained that the time-honoured constitution of the land, as comprehending commons, lords, and king, was suited better, both for stability and safety to the feelings and the principles of Englishmen, than a new form of democratic sway. Cromwell, during this council as before, held himself much aloof; but, at the last, when urged for his opinion, admitted that he, “so far as he had thought upon so grave and onerous a question, inclined his judgment rather to the last expressed position, could it be any wise decided what person might be called advisedly to fill the vacant throne; since, of a truth, he thought not any of the idolatrous and heaven-condemned scions of the late man admissible to dwell among—much less to govern—this regenerate and freedom-seeking people.” By some most underhanded means the tidings of this meeting, and the opinions held therein, were treasonably carried to the parliament, and they proceeded instantly to force a bill for their own dissolution through the house, encumbered with provisions wholly at variance with the freedom of election, and obnoxious to the great bulk of the people. It was in vain that Harrison conjured them, with most moving eloquence, to pause in their career of reckless and unprincipled ambition! —it was in vain!—they were that instant on the point of voting that a new election should be holden for four fifths of the members of the commons, the one fifth remaining to hold their seats for a yet farther time, and to possess the right of sanctioning or disallowing the admission of the newly-chosen delegates, as they might deem them honest and worthy vessels, or unsuited to the work in hand. At a late hour Oliver, who was waiting at White-hall in his own private chambers, was advertised of these strange and unjust proceedings; and, instantly commanding a company of soldiers to repair to the house, entered and took his seat among the members. He was more plainly—nay, even slovenly attired, than when he had appeared in public at any time for several years. His dress was of plain and coarse cloth, all black—doublet, and cloak, and hose! with stockings of gray worsted rolled up to his mid-thigh. While the debate continued he sat immersed, apparently, in thought, and listening most attentively to the opinions of the different orators. The speaker at length rose, as if to put the question—then beckoning to Harrison, who sat opposite him, he stood up calmly, and, as that officer approached him—“Now is the time!” he said; “now I must do it!” and forthwith he put off his hat, and began speaking in a mild tone, and more to the point than usual in his harangues, expressing his disapprobation, although moderately and in measured terms, of the motion before the house. But gradually, as he kindled with his subject, his speech became more vehement and fiery—his words rolled forth in one unbroken stream of bitter and severe invective, scorching and blighting as the electric flash—his features were inflamed and writhen with tremendous passion—his eyes lightened—and his whole frame expanded with a most perfect majesty of wrathful indignation. He rebuked them for their self-seeking and profaneness!—their oftentimes denial of true justice!—their oppression, their inordinate and selfish love of power!—their neglect of the brave and honest army!—their idolizing of the lawyers!—their trampling under foot the valiant men who had bled for them in the field!—their tampering with the false and time-serving Presbyterians! “And for what,” he cried, with loud and vehement tones, “for what all this? What but to perpetuate your own ill-gotten power—to replenish your own empty purses—empty through riot, and debauchery, and bribery, and every kind of ill which it befits not you to perpetrate—and which it were to me degrading even to mention or to think of! But now, I say,” he went on, stamping fiercely on the ground, “your time hath come! The Lord he hath disowned you! The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob hath done with you! He hath no need of you any more! Lo, he hath judged you, and cast you forth, and chosen fitter instruments to him, to execute that work in which you have dishonoured him—” “Order!” exclaimed one of the bolder of the members; “order! I rise to order—never have I yet heard any language so unparliamentary! so insolent!—the rather that it cometh from our own servant—one whom we have too fondly cherished —one whom, by raising to this unprecedented and undue elevation, we have endued with the daring and the power thus to brave us!” For a few moments Cromwell glared on the bold speaker, as though astonishment at the excess of his audacity had robbed him of the faculty of speech—then casting his hat on his disordered locks, he pulled it doggedly down upon his brows, and with a stamp that made the whole house echo, advancing on the gentleman who was yet speaking—“Come, sir,” he said, in a low hissing voice through his set teeth, griping the while his dagger's hilt as though he would have stabbed him on T 2 the spot, “come, come, sir, I will put an end to your loud prating!” then turning his back suddenly on him whom he addressed, he paced to and fro the hall, his whole face black with the blood which rushed to it as violently as though it would have burst from every pore and vein—his broad breast panting and heaving with emotion—and his entire aspect displaying the most ungovernable and tremendous passions—“You are no parliament, I say,” he shouted at the pitch of his stentorian voice —“you are no parliament! Ho! bring them in! —without there!—bring them in!” There was a sudden pause — a moment of unutterable terror! for such was the expression painted upon the faces of the craven members of the long parliament. When, years before, a king had dared to violate, in a far less degree, the privileges of that high assemblage, their own undaunted valour, fired by a sense of right—a proud uncompromising feeling of their own inborn worth—had wellnigh armed those patriots—for such they were—to battle with such weapons as chance afforded them against the licensed cut-throats of the sovereign—but, as the door flew open, and Colonel Worseley entered with a guard of twenty musketeers, blank and base apprehension sat on the pallid brows of three fourths of those present; nor did one man of the whole number offer to make the least resistance, to draw a sword, to raise a hand, or even to exchange a look with the strange person who, from so lately being their servant, or, at best, their equal, had thus, by one bold effort, rendered himself their master—their unquestioned, undisputed master! “This is not honest!” cried Sir Henry Vane, at length, when he had rallied from the first surprise. “It is against morality and common honesty!” Words cannot picture, language of man cannot describe the change that flashed across the speaking lineaments of Oliver. An instant—a short instant only, ere Vane addressed him, all had been virulent and active fury, lashed, as it were, by its own goadings into a state purely animal and uncontrollable. Now the fierce glare of anger instantly subsided, leaving the face, for the moment, passionless and vacant as an infant's; but, ere there was time—not for words, but for thought—the deepest sneer of scorn, of loathing, and unutterable, undisguised contempt succeeded. “Sir Harry Vane!” he replied, in a low stern whisper, which drove the blood back curdling through the veins of him on whose mind he had pounced, eagle-like, with ayenging talons—“oh, Sir Harry Vane! The Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane! Honesty, and Sir Harry Vane! Morality, and Harry Vane! —who, if he so had pleased, might have prevented this!—who is a juggler—a mere hypocrite—and hath not common honesty himself! A parliament! —I do profess, a precious parliament!—of drunkards!—knaves!—extortioners!—adulterers! Lo, there,” he added, pointing to Challoner, “there sits a noted wine-bibber—a very glutton and a drunkard! There!” casting his eyes toward Henry Marten and Sir Peter Wentworth, “there two most foul adulterers!” Then turning on his heel, as if he had already said enough, he waved his hand toward the soldiers, and in a voice as quiet and unruffled as if he had not been in anywise excited, commanded them to clear the house! “I,” exclaimed Lenthall, boldly—for, seeing that no violence was offered, he had recovered his scared spirits—“I am the speaker of this house, lawfully by its members chosen, and, save by vote of those same members or by actual force, I never quit its precinets while in life!” Then Harrison stepped slowly up the body of the long hall to the chair, attended by two musketeers; he laid his hand on Lenthall's shoulder, and prayed him to descend; and, without farther words, he came down from his seat, and putting on his hat, departed from the house all crestfallen and astounded. Algernon Sidney followed him at once, though with a statelier mien and bolder bearing, eighty more of the members moving with him toward the door. While there had seemed to be the slightest chance of any opposition to his will, Cromwell had stood in silence, with his arms folded on his breast, facing the speaker's chair, with a dark scowl upon his brow and his lips rigidly compressed; but now, when he perceived that all, without more words, were skulking away from the house, he once again addressed them. “It is you,” he exclaimed, “it is you who have thrust this on me. Night and day have I prayed the Lord that he would slay me rather than put me on the doing of this work.” “Then wherefore do it,” asked Allen, bluntly, ere he left the house, “if that it be so grievous to you? There is yet time enough to undo that which is already done—and, as your conscience tells you, ill done, my Lord of Cromwell!” “Conscience! Ha! conscience! Alderman,” retorted Oliver, “and what did thine tell thee when thou, as treasurer of the army, didst embezzle much more than one hundred thousand pounds to thine own uses? What sayest thou to that, good alderman! Ho! ho! methinks I have thee there. Guards, apprehend this peculator! Away with him! away with him! I say,” and he stamped angrily upon the floor as to enforce his words, “until he answers for his deep misdoings!” Sullen, humiliated, and unpitied, for they had lost already the respect of honest men of all denominations, the members of that parliament, which had dethroned and slain a powerful monarch—destroyed the constitution, and disenthralled the people of a mighty nation—vanquished all foreign foes, and raised their country from a secondary to a firstrate power in Europe, now sneaked away to find a miserable refuge in the despised obscurity of private life—deserted by the people in their turn, whom they had first deserted at the dictates of a depraved and poor ambition. When all had gone forth from the hall, the worker of this mighty revolution fixed his eyes on the mace which lay upon the board before the speaker's chair—“What shall we do,” he said, “with this fool's bawble? Here, carry it away!” and, at the word, a private of the guard bore off that ancient emblem of the people's delegated power—on which, not to preserve his soul, Charles Stuart would have dared lay a finger of offence—at the first bidding of the simple citizen of a small English borough, raised by his own strange sagacity and the interminable firmness of his single will to a far loftier station than the proudest despotism of the East! He snatched the instrument of dissolution from the trembling fingers of the clerk; ordered the great doors to be locked; and, girt by his devoted guard, returned to his own palace at Whitehall, in all, save name, a king. The same day saw the dissolution of the council; and, ere the members were forgotten, little time as elapsed before they were so, the army and the navy sent their addresses up to the lord-general, declaring that they were content to live or die in the support of these his measures; and every corner of the island resounded with the loud hymns of the fanatics, exulting that “the great and long-desired reformation was now near the birth! Blessing the God of Heaven, who had called Cromwell forth and led him on, not only in the high places of the field, but also—among those mighty ones whom God hath left—to the dissolving of the late parliament!”—rejoicing that the fifth monarchy, the kingdom of Messiah was at hand, and that the promised reign—the grand millennium of the saints —was now to be established in the renovated commonwealth! And he—the self-deceiver—the fool of fancied destiny—waked through the watches of the night to seek the Lord in prayer!—to read the oracles of the fates in the unquiet workings of his own restless spirit!—to detect, in the success of his ambitious projects—projects unknown or disguised to his inmost soul—the wonderful fulfilment of the prophecies of old!—to cry aloud in the dark solitude of his nocturnal chamber. “True! true! It was true that the spirit thundered at midnight in mine ears! Lo! the accomplishment is here! Am I not—am I not the first in England—though I be not as yet called king?” CHAPTER IV. “Cyriack, this three years' day these eyes though clear, To outward view, of blemish or of spot, Bereft of light, their seeing have forgot; Nor to their idle orbs doth sight appear Of sun, or moon, or star throughout the year, Or man or woman. Yet I argue not Against Heaven's hand or will, nor bate a jot Of heart or hope; but still bear up and steer Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask? The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied In liberty's defence, my noble task, Of which all Europe rings from side to side.” Milton's Sonnets. In the old parlour, still decorated, although years had flown, with the same faded hangings—more faded now—of dark green serge, before his desk of ebony, and near a seacoal fire, which threw a brilliant care-dispelling light upon the features still comely and unwrinkled, upon the soft hair scarcely streaked with any tinge of gray, and the bright eye still clear and vivid as though it were not robbed of its intelligence, sat that far greater and more holy poet who, as himself has told us, did not “Sometimes forget Those other two equalled with him in fate, So were he equalled with them in renown, Blind Thamyris and blind Mœunides;” but to whose blameless spirit, fraught as it was with knowledge of his own mighty genius, it was not given to know that he should no less supersede in fame, in immortality of praise, the objects of his emulation, than he exceeded them in the solemnity, the fervour, and the cultivation of his unrivalled intellect. He sat not now, however, as before, alone—for two young females, not, perhaps, to speak strictly, beautiful, but still attractive, and bearing in their pale features undoubted tokens of nature's richest dower—high intellect—were seated in the same small apartment. One, placed before the organ, had just ceased drawing from its vocal tubes that flood of rich religious harmony which ever was the strongest source of inspiration to the soul of her benighted parent. The other, who had just received a packet from a servitor who was now passing from the parlour, was in the act of opening it, speaking the while in a voice which, though more feminine, and, at the same time, very similar in its peculiar sweetness, was still less musically soft than her father's tones of unmixed melody. “If I err not,” she said, “this should be from the hand of your much valued friend, Sir Edgar Ardenne.” “Indeed! is it, indeed?” cried Milton, eagerly. “Dear, spirit wounded friend—fain would I hear of him. Quick! quick, my girl. Truly my soul thirsts for his tidings, as thirsts the panting hart for the cool water-brooks! Is it a foreign letter?” “Not foreign, sir,” she answered, “but surely from your friend. It hath for date—`The commonwealth's ship Jael, now off Spithead, June 29.' I will proceed to show you the contents;” and, without farther words, she read it out in a clear fluent voice, her father listening all the time with a most earnest and unwavering attention depicted on his pregnant and expressive features.— “How shall I offer to console you, my most honoured and beloved friend,” thus ran the letter, “under the grievous dispensation with which it has seemed good to Him who cannot err to make yet farther trial of your excellence. If I should set down aught, it would but be, I know, as weak and whispering sounds when brought beside the powerful and all-assuaging harmonies which your own tutored mind, mature in wisdom, and superior no less far in fervid piety to mine than in the gifts of science, hath poured forth, in a never-ceasing stream, to lull the pains and minister to the repinings of the flesh. Condolence, therefore, I nor offer—nor would you, I think, receive!—nothing except a conscience such as yours can bear the body up beneath so sad a deprivation—and such a one can do much more, and doth. Moreover, if in such circumstance any thing can be termed happy, happy it is that your enjoyments are for the most part of that spiritual and internal nature, which change of day or night—of noontide splendour or of everlasting darkness—can nothing take away nor yet deteriorate. Truly you have laid up for yourself treasures `where the moth and the rust do not corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal.' I have read through your task, in leisure moments of my perilous and weary watches—your defence of the English people—and IT IS A DEFENCE! If you had written never any thing before, this should prove you both patriot and poet—should win you what, I fancy, you, no more than I, esteem at an inordinate or priceless value—the vain world's voice of praise—and greater far than this, the approbation of all good and wise men now, and the eternal reverence and gratitude of ages that shall be hereafter. But of this enough! No words of mine, alas! can remedy or sooth those griefs, if there be any, which your own high philosophy have not removed already—and, to assure you of my real sympathy, they are, I know, even more needless. Of that you can want no assurance! I would that we could hold more intimate communion—for I have many Vol. II.—U things to say to you which I love not to trust to paper—the rather that that paper must now pass under eyes not yours before its sense can be transmitted to your ears. But since we cannot converse freely face to face, as in more happy days of old— days which, to both of us, are now but a delightful memory of things that never can return—why we must even interchange our sentiments as best we may; setting down what we may in prudence and with safety, and supplying—each from his own knowledge of the others' wonted train of thought and feeling—that which must be omitted. This, for my own part, I will entreat you to assay to do, bearing in mind the last important conversation which took place between us—with my own fears concerning things and persons of no small weight in England, and your assurances that those my fears were fruitless and ill-grounded. We have learned, here in the fleet, but a few months ago, how the lord-general hath dissolved the parliament by actual and armed violence—and now we further hear that he doth exercise in person all the prerogatives and duties of an absolute uncontrolled monarch—making, at his own pleasure, peace and war—signing and ratifying treaties with foreign potentates—excluding or admitting whom he will to the great council of the nation; bearing himself, in short, as if he were legitimately and of right the master of the liberties and lives of freeborn, but, alas! no more free, Englishmen. I may not here disguise from you that, shortly after the intelligence of his first usurpation—for such I, for one, hold the dissolution of the parliament, as I may say at the pike's point, how worthless or inadequate soever it might be—a general council held by delegates from every vessel of our victorious fleet voted an address to the general, approving of the measure which I reprobate, and promising to live or die in his support. Nor, I imagine, have I any need to state to you, that neither I, nor a far more important person, to wit, our great commander, Blake, had any share or portion in this vote or address—both of us, for the time, holding ourselves content to do our duty to our country against her foreign foes, whatever the complexion of her internal policy. The flag of England must not float less superbly now than when it overcanopied the crowns of our immortal sovereigns of old. But now I will entreat you, ere I lay down my pen—which I must do somewhat the more in haste that the last signal from our admiral is to weigh anchors and stand out to sea in chase of a Dutch squadron—to inform me at your leisure of the more intricate and hidden motives of late matters in the state. Whether this man hath indeed, by his own daring only, and at the prompting of insatiate ambition, compassed an usurpation so beyond all exception flagrant and audacious, that I comprehend not how even his sagacity can cloak it in the eyes of men with a fair semblance—or whether the times be indeed so much out of joint that these most marvellous aggressions on the privileges and the liberty of parliament can be in anywise required or justified on grounds of hindering greater anarchy and detriment to England than shall arise from this invasion of time-honoured usages. Our anchor is apeake already; and some of our light brigantines, having slipped their cables, are, as we well believe—for we may hear their cannon although it is so hazy that we can see scarce a league to seaward—even now engaged with Van Trump's rearmost vessels. I send this with the pilot, who shall despatch it by express to London. I pray you once again write to me, as to one secluded from intelligence of all those things which are most dear to him. We shall, 'tis very like, put back to Portsmouth after action, should it seem fit to the great Moderator of the universe to grant us victory, to which our endeavours shall be in nowise wanting. To Him I now commend you. Valeas, igitur, haud immemor observantissimi tui. “Edgar Ardenne.” Several times during the space occupied by the recitation of this letter had Milton interrupted it by comments to his gentle secretaries on its style, its language, and, above all, the noble sentiments which breathed in every line of it. At moments he was affected almost to the point of tears, and again, at others, a bright benignant smile would kindle his whole aspect into sunny animation. After his daughter had ceased reading, “Kind heart,” he said—“kind heart, and generous, as kind. We must forthwith reply to him. He knoweth not, moreover, how dear and intimate a secretary and attendant is vouchsafed to us in our diurnal gloom. Hast thou thy vellum ready, girl, and pens? I will dictate forthwith, for lo! his letter hath been long delayed upon its route, and he hath anxiously, I doubt not, looked for an answer to his queries.” Having received an affirmative reply from her who had been playing on the organ, and who now placed herself beside him at the desk, he commenced dictating in his wonted voice of slow and silvery music. “TO THE MOST NOBLE GENTLEMAN, THE MUCH ESTEEMED SIR EDGAR ARDENNE. “The letter which you sent to me, my true and honoured friend, addressed from Spithead hither, previously to the renowned and memorable victory of July, wherein not only was the indefeisible and ancient right of England to be the queen and mistress of the ocean waves permanently and triumphantly established by the tried arms of our stout seamen, but that most brave and dangerous foe— during whose lifetime never had the sturdy Hollanders yielded to us the palm—Van Trump was laid at rest from troubling us now any more—hath but now reached me, although frore winter is already treading hard on the retiring footsteps of his more lusty predecessor. Grateful, indeed, and pleasing to my spirit are the kind sympathizings which you have therein displayed with my infirmities—great, truly, is the loss of light—the shutting out of wisdom from one of its most easy and familiar entrances—the quenching of the finest, the most delicate, and subtile of the senses. But surely, under this affliction mighty and manifold, all glory be to Him who to the shorn lamb tempereth the wind, are still my consolations, and—truly I can use the word in its full sense—my joys! First, do I feel this proud conviction, that, ere mine eyes were sealed in night, they had performed their task, not negligently, nor with a niggard and reluctant labour, but with such ample execution, such overflowing measure of success, that not alone the cause which I have laboured to uphold, even to the self-sacrifice of God's first gift of light, hath been admitted true in every land of Christendom, and I, its author, robed in a vestment of such high repute as might compensate for any loss less grievous, but more the ill-advised and senseless wretch who dared to strive against me in the arena of the schools hath paid for his temerity, not only by the utter deprivation of all renown which might before have been conceded him, but by his own decease—perishing of the rankling hatred and mean jealousy which follows ever on defeat when sustained by a poor, base spirit. These things, then, are to me a great and wondrous U 2 consolation—first, that I, in my degree, have done my duty to my beloved country—secondly, that to her the sacrifice hath not been profitless nor the devotion unacceptable—and, thirdly, that to me it hath brought that best boon of the world's giving— that boon to pant for which is, of a truth, `the last infirmity of noble minds'—a high, and, though myself I say it, not an unmerited renown. Nor fancy, my kind friend, that, in my blindness, I am deserted quite and robbed of natural enjoyments—no! by the gracious mercy of that Lord who never casts us into peril, or temptation, or adversity, but likewise he finds for us a way of escape from the same; I am so piously attended by the affectionate and loving cares of my two daughters, my organists, my secretaries, nurses, and companions, that less acutely do I feel the greatness of my loss than it were easy for you to imagine. Besides, long since have I looked forward to this consummation of my daily and nocturnal labours, as to a certain unavoidable result—and poor, indeed, were the resources and the energies of him who, having long foreseen a coming evil, should lack the power to reconcile himself to its endurance, when it seemed good unto the Lord to send it in his own appointed time. “Now, with regard to what you say touching the difficulty or the danger of intimate communion between us by epistle—relieve yourself from any terror—it is a child's tongue which conveys the sense of all the letters he receives to her blind parent's ear—it is a child's hand which commits to writing each syllable that flows from her blind parent's mouth. Wherefore, whatever you would say to me, write now, and ever, with all fearlessness and freedom, as I will answer to your queries. Surely the matters which have caused so much of grieving and anxiety to your most noble mind have likewise been a stumbling-block to many. Needful it was for England's weal, for her salvation I might say, that the self-seeking carnal-minded junto—who arrogated to themselves the rights and titles of a parliament, and who, having once liberated, were now striving to enslave their country—should be cast forth from the high places of their usurpation. And by whom could they be cast forth save by the excellent and most wise person whom I am grieved to see that you do still mistrust? Deeply, most deeply was he moved—and fervently, with tears and prayers continually, and supplications earnest and importunate, did he beseech the Ruler of all mortal councils that this cup should pass from him —but it might not be granted. Truly, had Cromwell been ambitious, would he at once have yielded up the power which he for a short time assumed, to a new chosen parliament, assembled at the earliest? Truly, had he so willed, he might have then been king—but no! he laboured for his country's weal, and he has won it! And again, if he be now protector of the land, wielding the sword of execution, and weighing with the balances of justice —I pray you, how was he so eminently raised above his fellows? Did he so elevate himself, carving his way through patriotic opposition to that thorny seat of power? Doth he sit now upon unruly and unwilling necks of subjugated and rebellious citizens? Oh no! But by the resignation of the free elected parliament—which succeeded that base remnant over whose fall not one man shed a tear in England—of all their delegated powers— powers which they soon learned they could not profitably wield—into the hands of him whom they saw—and saw truly—to be the only person capable of holding England's helm aright amid the turbulent and stormy seas of foreign warfare and domestic anarchy. Remember you how we discoursed one time touching the possibility of the existence of republics? And how I, dazzled by the immortal glare of classic stories, caught by the light which I then deemed a star—a living star of glory —but now have ascertained to be a false delusive meteor—how I contended that, as Rome and Greece were free and mighty once, so England should be likewise when modelled to a form of pure democracy? Do you remember this—and your own arguments against me? Now, I confess it, you have conquered—and I, wise as I held myself, was groping like a benighted traveller amid the ruined labyrinths and fallen shrines of false divinities. Truly there is no tyranny like to the tyranny of multitudes. Till the majority of men shall be, as you then said, wise and unselfish, virtuous, honest, and enlightened, till then it is in vain to hope for good from any government administered by that majority —that hundred-headed, fickle-willed, false-hearted monster which is called the people. “England was tottering on the brink of ruin in the years that preceded the all-glorious '49, and Oliver stepped in and rescued her from lying the dishonourable victim of one tyrant. England again was falling headlong—headlong into an abyss of anarchy and vice, and misery and folly—and now again has the same guardian of his country—the same great Oliver stepped in, and saved her from becoming the most miserable slave and harlot of ten millions, fiercer each one and more tyrannical than he who paid the forfeit of his crimes upon the scaffold of Whitehall. Never, in any former day, were all men's liberties so well defined, so jealously secured, so strictly and so punctually guarded, as they now are—never was justice yet so equally administered without respect of persons or estates. Each man of England can, indeed, sit now under his own vine and his own fig-tree, fearless, content, and free. Happy, and virtuous, and rich at home—honoured and feared abroad—succouring the oppressed in every foreign clime—riding the ocean in secure and undisputed mastery—shielding her sons, in whatsoever quarter of the wide world they may be wandering, by the mere shadow of her name. This is the lot of England now! When was it so before? And now that it has once been won for her—won by her Great Protector—who shall e'er wrest it from her? when shall it cease to be? But I grow warm— enthusiastical—as who would not, that knows him as he should be known, in praise of this most wondrous man? I have a boon to ask of you—a boon which I beseech you—by the memory of those pleasant days when we two wandered by the classic waters of the Tiber and Ilissus, when we two mused among the ruins of the Coliseum and the palace-tombs of the dead Cæsars—grant to me. It is the first I ever asked of you, and you will not refuse it. Peace is concluded with the sturdy Hollanders; our fleets may float from the white cliffs of Albion beyond the pillars of the Grecian hero—beyond the far Symplegades—beyond the islands of the blessed—over the vanished Atalantis, even to the free forest-shores of that great western land named of our virgin queen—and find no flag to brave them. Sheath, then, your sword. England hath need of you at home. Return, return, and you shall own me right in my opinion and Cromwell clear in his great office; else will I be content that you shall call me now no longer “Your most affectionate friend and admirer, “John Milton. “Westminster, this 14th day of January, 1654.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CROMWELL. BOOK V. “The third of the same moon, whose former course Had all but crowned him, on the selfsame day Deposed him gently from his throne of force, And laid him with the earth's preceding clay. And showed not fortune thus how fame and sway, And all we deem delightful, and consume Our souls to compass through each arduous way, Are in her eyes less happy than the tomb? Were they but so in man's, how different were his doom!” Childe Harold. CHAPTER I. “A more than earthly crown The dictatorial wreath.” “He who surpasses or subdues mankind Must look down on the hate of those below Though high above the sun of glory glow, And far beneath the earth and ocean spread, Round him are icy rocks, and loudly blow Contending tempests on his naked head, And thus reward the toils which to those summits led.” Childe Harold. It was on the evening of the twenty-sixth of June, some five years later than the date of Milton's letter, urging upon Sir Edgar Ardenne the propriety of his return to England—yet, since he had dictated it, the poet had received no line or token from his friend. After the peace which closed the long and hard-fought struggle with the Hollanders, and decided the supremacy of England on the seas, throwing up his commission, Ardenne had left the navy; nor, since that day, had any tidings been received of one who had, a little time before, so occupied the general mouth, and played a part so eminent in that great drama—the World's History. Such is renown!—such popular applause!—such human gratitude! The man who had preserved the life of Oliver on Winsley field!—who had secured his victory on Marston Moor!—who had, to the abandonment of all that could have rendered his own life happy, laboured as the most strenuous and faithful of that great being's followers, so long as he believed him true—to England—and to himself!—who, with a yet harder sacrifice, quitted his side the very moment he perceived the dawning symptoms of ambition in one whom he had loved and honoured—as men but rarely love and honour! This man was now forgotten—forgotten by the land for which he had so deeply suffered—forgotten by the friend he had so deeply served! The past anniversary of this day had been a day of splendour and rejoicing—the night had been one of joy, festivity, and mirth. From every steeple in the huge metropolis the merry bells had chimed with their most jovial notes—from park and tower the loud voice of the cannon thundered in noisy concert—from every casement tapers, and lamps, and torches sent forth unwonted radiance—and from each court and square huge bonfires streamed heavenward, while by their light the multitude sat feasting and carousing, to the health of the Protector. The past anniversary of this day had witnessed the superb and solemn ceremonial of his installation to that office which he had filled with so much dignity and honour to himself, with so much profit and advancement to his country, during the four preceding years. With all the glorious preparation, the pride, and pomp, and circumstance which decks the coronation of a monarch, with proclamation of the kings at arms, and homage of bareheaded lords, and acclamations of the multitude, and addresses from the delegates of foreign potentates, Oliver had been decorated with a robe of purple more splendidly elaborate than the attire of any former king; he had been girded with the rich sword of state; he had received a sceptre, massive with solid gold, with which to sway the destinies Vol. II.—X of England; a noble copy of the Holy Writ, whereby to wield that sceptre rightly. Generals had borne his train; the parliament had sanctioned his investiture as performed by its speaker; the people had assented! In all but name, that “feather in the hat,” which adds not any thing to him who wears it—that “toy and bawble,” which he had oftentimes rejected, partly in politic accordance to the prejudices of his more fanatical advisers, partly in superstitious, although unconfessed, obedience to the prophetic voice which had forewarned him of his coming greatness—the citizen of Huntingdon was now the King of England! Great, powerful, triumphant, unresisted! His every project splendidly successful! His every wish fulfilled! His love of glory—thirst of power —ambition to be First—all satisfied, if not, indeed, insatiate! His boast, that he would make the name of Englishman as potent and as far revered as ever was the style of antique Roman, completed to the letter! The country, which he governed, raised from the deepest degradation to the loftiest fame! His navies irresistible — his armies everywhere victorious—his alliance courted—and his enmity most humbly deprecated by dynasties which, but one century before—and that, too, when the most mighty of her former sovereigns, the manly-minded virgin queen, had filled her throne—regarded England as a mere speck on the bosom of the sea; hard, it is true, of access, and difficult to conquer; but powerless abroad, and exercising scarce a shadow either of influence or power among the mightier royalties of Europe! Was Cromwell happy? In a high chamber of his more than royal residence, while all without was rife with demonstrations of respect for his affeered and legal dignity, Oliver sat alone. Sumptuously, though still plainly clad, in an entire suit of sable velvet, the jewelled sword of state which had been, on that same day of the foregoing year, buckled to his side, lying upon the board before him, and bearing in his altered mien—altered most strangely, and adapted to his altered station—that grave majestic dignity which had replaced the bluntness of his soldier-bearing— musing in solitude and silence, the greatest man in England passed the first anniversary of his assured and titled greatness. There was, however, now no glow of exultation on that pale cheek and careworn brow—no curl of triumph on the lip—no flash of gratified ambition in the downcast eye! Lines deeper and sterner than the wrinkles of advancing age were seared into that massive forehead—a shadow gloomy and sad had veiled that hollow eye —exhaustion, weariness of heart, sickness of spirit, were written visibly in the pale caverns of that haggard cheek! There was a trifling sound—a casual rustling in the large apartment, a thousand such as which each hour brings to unsuspicious ears—he started to his feet!—he thrust his hand into his bosom!—he bent a searching and disquiet eye into each corner of the room, which was so strongly lighted that not a shadow could be seen in its most distant angle!—he listened as the condemned prisoner listens for the foot of the law's last minister. The sound came not again—and he resumed his seat; but, as he did so, a sharp and jingling clash told that beneath the civic garb there lurked a shirt of steel; and the light glittered on the butt of a concealed pistol, just rendered visible by the derangement of his doublet. The soldier of a hundred fields—the vanquisher and scorner of a thousand perils—he who had ridden to the fray as to the banquet—he who had stood all dauntless and unflinching among a storm of bullets, that cut down all around him—wore hidden armour—shook at an empty sound! A pile of papers lay before him on the table—threats from anonymous assassins— hints from concealed and faithfull spies, dwellers at every court in Europe—despatches intercepted —private correspondence opened and searched— and, on the top of all, a pamphlet, fresh from the press, with the leaves partly cut, and a broad-bladed dagger, which he had used to open them, lying upon it, as if to mark the place! It bore the ominous and fearful title, Killing no Murder! After a long pause, during which, though seated, he still watched with an acute and anxious ear for a recurrence of the sound that had disturbed him, he again took up the pamphlet, and with a painful and intense fixedness of study, that marked the harrowing interest he took in its minutest arguments, perused its closely-printed pages. Midnight had long passed ere he finished it—with a deep sigh he closed and laid it down again—a sigh not of regret, but of relieved suspense, such as men heave when the catastrophe of some exciting tragedy is over! “The villain!” he exclaimed; “the perilous and subtle villain! Damnable arguments! Accursed perversion of the talents and the intellect, which God giveth unto man for good!” He rose, and paced the apartment to and fro, with steps now faltering and slow, now hurried, short, and rapid! “ `And my own muster-roll'—he says—`contains the names of those who burn to emulate the glory of the younger Brutus—who do aspire to the honour of delivering their country'—and by what— what but my secret murder?”—his brow became more gloomy than before; and yet again, after a little space, it kindled with its ancient animation. “A lie!” he cried, aloud, and in a tone of triumph; “I do believe, a lie!—a wicked and malignant lie! framed but to break my rest! It cannot be— it cannot—that my brave fellows—my own ironsides—my followers in a hundred battles can be but true and loyal! and yet”—he went on, the momentary gleam of spirit fading—“and yet it doth crave wary walking!—ay! and, as Milton would say in his classic tongue, fas est et ab hoste doceri! But I will watch—yea! watch with my sword drawn and my light burning—surely the Lord of Hosts will shield his servant from the midnight dagger as from the open-smiting sword! I will trust no man!—no! not one! Harrison hath looked cold on me of late, and prated much of Ehud and of Saul! and Fleetwood thwarts me! Hacker, who was my friend, is now my bitter foe! And they have dared to liken me to Ahab, and to cry `Ha! ha! Hast thou slain, and dost thou take possession?' And Ormond hath come over, as I learn today—another Syndercombe and Sexby business! The snares are set—are set, I say, on every side!— pitfalls are digged for my feet, and arrows whetted privily against me! And wherefore? They cannot say that I have wronged one man in England —that I have wrung one penny from their purses, or shed one drop of blood, save in due course of law. They cannot charge me with bloodthirstiness, for I have been long-suffering and merciful—ay! even to a fault!—but I will be so now no longer— Slingsby must come to trial, ay, and Hewet—and, if condemned, as the Lord liveth, they shall die! die as murderers and common stabbers—die, I say, soul and body! They cannot say that England is not free, and powerful, and happy as never was she heretofore!—and yet they hate me!—ay, and take counsel for my deatlr!—and poison all hearts— even of my own friends—against me! `and I shall perish,' this base fellow prophesieth, `like dung X 2 from off the earth—and they that look upon my greatness shall ask of me, `Where is he?' ” He paused in his distempered walk, and, falling on his knees, burst into a passion of loud sobs and tears —“My God,” he cried—“my God, why hast thou thus forsaken me? Oh yield not up thy servant to the power of the ungodly, nor suffer the blashemers to prevail against him. For surely it is thou— thou, Lord—who hast thrust on me this undesired greatness; who hast compelled me, though reluctant and rebellious, to wear these trappings of authority—when, as thou knowest—even thou, who knowest all things—far rather I had dwelt by a woodside and tended sheep, than been the ruler of this stiff-necked and ungrateful generation. But thou hast done this violence to my affections, thou hast disposed of thy servant for the best in thine own sight, as from the beginning it was written down—yea! thou didst send thy minister to warn him of thy pleasure when but a child, foolish and unregenerate, and a slave to sin! Thou didst redeem him from the power of Satan, and sure he was in grace—and he that is in thy grace once can never more relapse! Lo! by my hand thou didst strike down the man Charles Stuart, putting it nightly and by day into my soul, `thou shalt not suffer him to live'—and thou hast set me up, not for my own pleasure nor at my request, but at thine own singular especial choice, for the advancement of thy cause, the welfare and the safety of thy church!—and thou hast made me, as thou promisedst of yore, though not a king, THE First in England! And yet thou dost abandon now thy servant—thou dost yield up thy true and faithful one—who, for thy cause, hath yielded up his all—to the delusions of the enemy—the power of the Evil One! I ask not, in this merciful?—but is this just, O Lord? Thou knowest well how I have served thee, neither grudgingly nor with eye service—but in all purity and truth of spirit—and now, even now, Lord, when thou hast, as it seems, forgotten me, I turn to thee alone for aid, to thee for succour and for justice! Let me not perish utterly—let not my blood, which has flowed ever at thy bidding freely, be spilled by a base stabber!—let me not be cast forth from the high place whereon thou hast seated me, as a thing worthless and despised; but let me die, when thou hast done with me, in fulness of my fame, either upon my deathbed, thence passing peaceably into thy presence, or gallantly upon my charger's back amid the blare of trumpets—” A step was heard without—a low tap at the door —instantly he rose from his knee, holding the Bible, which he had opened as he commenced his wild and almost impious prayer, in one hand, while with the other he grasped the hilt of the short massy sword beside him—“Enter!” he said, in a stern calm voice; and, at the word, one of his bodyguards stepped in, announcing that a stranger was below, craving to speak privately on matters of great import with his highness. “What like is he?” Oliver asked, sharply—“a stranger, ha! Is he a tall pale man, with a deep scar on his right cheek—a mantle of blue broad cloth with a red cape, a slouched hat and red feather?” “Even so, please your highness,” replied the soldier. “And doth he wear his right hand gloved, resting upon the hilt of a long tuck, and three rings on the fingers of his left?” “Of a truth I observed not,” the messenger began. “Begone then, instantly—demand his name—not that it matters—but mark his hands, I tell thee— they should be as I tell thee. On the forefinger of the left a plain gold hoop, and a large seal-ring of cornelian, with a small guard of jet upon the second. If it be so, say to him I will go now no farther in that matter, but will send one to confer with him at three hours past noon to-morrow, at the place which he wots of. If it be not as I say to you, secure him on the peril of your life, and have him away forthwith to the Gatehouse!—but in neither case trouble me any more this night. Begone!” and, as the soldier left the room, he muttered something to himself inaudibly—drew out no fewer than three pistols from different parts of his attire, looked closely to the flints and priming, extinguished all the lights save one, locked, double locked, and barred the outer door—then raised the tapestry in a corner of the room, opened a panel in the wainscoting, and, gliding through it into a devious passage in the thickness of the wall, stole like a guilty thing to a remote bedchamber, different from that in which he had slept the preceding night, known only to one old and trusted servitor. CHAPTER II. “Perchance she-died in youth: it may be bowed With woes far heavier than the ponderous tomb That weighed upon her gentle dust, a cloud Might gather o'er her beauty, and a gloom In her dark eye, prophetic of the doom Heaven gives its favourites—early death.” Childe Harold. The power, the wealth, and the prosperity of England daily and almost hourly increased!—the ravages of war had long since disappeared from her deep velvet pastures and her happy homes! Every religion was endured except when its professors intermeddled in state matters—all parties, whether cavalier, or Presbyterian, or fifth-monarchist, shared equally the law's protection, alike relied on the protector's evenhanded justice! The arts and sciences were more encouraged; learned and polished scholars were esteemed at the court of Oliver in higher and more just repute; morality was more rewarded, licentiousness and vice more frowned down than ever they had been before. Nor, though the court was rigid almost to excess in morals, was its decorum chilled by any touch of jealous puritanical moroseness! All innocent amusements were admitted and enjoyed freely, Cromwell himself keeping a stud of race-horses, and labouring to promote in all things lawful—not the mere welfare, but the happiness and comfort of his meanest subject! No Christian sect was hindered in its worship or observances; even the trampled and scorned Israelite finding an advocate and friend in that great man, who went so infinitely far in toleration, beyond, not his own age alone, but the most liberal usages of the most tolerant of modern nations. Still did his cares, his griefs, and his perplexities but multiply!—no success was enough to please—no general prosperity enough to satiate the people—craving eternally the something new—losing the tangible realities of present in the dim longings after future happiness—forgetting benefits conferred—ungrateful for past merits—lightheaded, fickle, and false-hearted. Day after day new plots broke out; and though they burst all harmlessly—the veteran bearing still, as it would seem, a charmed life—every detected scheme, punished or pardoned, left its deep sting behind. Cromwell's existence was no longer healthful—his spirit was no longer, as of yore, elastic and storm-riding as the eagle's pinion! His days were spent in bitter, because thankless, labours—his nights in agonizing apprehensions. It was not that he trembled—it was not that a vile and dastard fear of death shook his soul from its eminence—it was not that he would have doubted any more to hurl himself in open strife upon the deadliest hazard now, when the monarch of the land, than when he fought a simple colonel of the ironsides—a theme of dread to others—himself dreading nothing! But it was the suspense—the doubt—the inability to harbour trust or confidence in any of those nearest to his person. The gnawing heart-consuming sense of being undervalued, dealt with ungratefully, wronged, hated, and betrayed. Still in the prime of intellectual manhood, his strong form was bowed and feeble; his hair, once sable as the raven's wing, thin, weak, and gray; his piercing eye downcast and veiled, and his whole aspect that of a man worn out, even by his own success, spiritless and heartbroken. Parliament after parliament, convoked to settle the provisions of the nation, rebelled against his power, running, as had their predecessors, wild on abstruse religious doctrines, and anxious to plunge all things once more into anarchy, by striving to work out their frantic phantasies of perfect and unchangeable republics. Each after each he was compelled, not for his own sake merely, but for England's, which else they would assuredly have hurled again into the abyss of civil discord, to break up and dissolve them. Nothing could crush the tameless hardihood with which he bore up, nerved by their very pressure, against burdens to a slighter intellect wholly unbearable—conspiracies of enemies, false-heartedness of friends!—treasons and anarchy at home, insults and wars abroad! All yielded to the active vigour with which he sprang to grapple them, but by that very vigour was his own mighty spirit, like a bow overstrained by too long tension, despoiled of its own strength, its pliability, its power of renewed exertion. The capture of the rich West Indian isles—the persecutions of the Vaudois, remitted at the first hint of his potential voice—the all-important port of Dunkirk, so long the secret aim of England's politic ambition, ceded to his victorious arms—cast a bright gleam, indeed, on his declining years; but it was like the last gleam of the wintry sunshine, that gilds, but leaves no impress of its glory on the snow-mantled earth. A nearer sorrow, a more domestic grief, was destined to wear through the last link of the corroding chain —a mere affliction, such as befalls each father of a family many times in a life, and, for the most, leaves but slight traces even on minds less firmly moulded, annihilated the gigantic energies of that great master spirit which had, throughout its mortal course, met nothing that could cope with it, nothing that had not been subdued, enslaved, and overwhelmed by its indomitable will. Elizabeth, his best beloved daughter, a woman of invaluable worth—modest, and delicate, and feminine, and gentle; yet of a character the most decisive—a principle the most undeviating—a permanence and rectitude of purpose the most immoveable—and, above all, an influence on her father the most peculiar and impressive—lay wasting on a bed of mortal sickness. Throughout the whole of his broad realms—those realms wherein the sweet calm home affections have ever flourished the most greenly—there lived not any father more kind, solicitous, forbearing, and devoted in his paternal love than the unconquered victor—the merciless avenger —the stern judge—the regicide—the ruler! Hard as he was abroad, cold and unbending in all outward show, in his domestic hours none were more warm than he, more playful, or affectionate. Thus constituted toward all his children, the dearest to his feelings, as the most prized and valued in his judgment, was Elizabeth, who now, consumed by an unnatural and mortal malady, was waning hourly before his eyes. She was the only one of all his family—the only one of all his friends—save only Edgar Ardenne, who had dared ever to remonstrate with him during the upward course of his ambition. She had confronted many a time his sophistry with that most sound of all philosophies, the pure creed of the Christian—she had rebuked his zealous and fanatic superstitions with regulated and sincere religion—she had accused him of that restless and insatiate ambition, which she perceived, or fancied she perceived, to be the instigator and the planner, it might be unsuspected even by himself, of all his darker actions. She had rebuked him during the trial—she had besought him, on her bended knees —before the execution of the king—to spare, not his crowned victim only, but his own deathless fame—his own immortal soul! Her wishes set at naught, her prayers unheeded, she had not once— no, not for one brief moment—complained, or murmured, or revolted! She had not once reproached him with that which it was now too late to remedy, but she had ever been the soother of his disquiet mind, when fits of his accustomed hypochondriasm had overcome him with remorse, and terror, and, visions ominous of wo—she had ever been his calm monitress, inculcating a milder and a holier creed —exhorting him to penitence, as the sole path to pardon and to peace. And it was strange that now, in his most lordly plenitude of power, the two sympathies which he most keenly felt were toward the only two of human beings who had seen through— perceived the earliest, and opposed the latest, the most darling objects of his soul. Abandoned now by all—the leader, revered, but loved not by his followers—the monarch, self-upheld above rebellious subjects—the master, flattered, and courted, and, perhaps, betrayed—he clung with a sharp painful yearning, as to the only feelings of his heart entirely pure and unmixed with aught worldly, to his affection for Elizabeth and his regret for Ardenne! Never, since he had fixed his firm seat on the bloody throne of Charles, had his most cherished daughter been what she was in his more innocent and humbler days. Her smile was as sweet, yet it was now no longer joyous; and her cheek lost its roses, and her form its roundness; a glassy film veiled her soft eye; and he—the father—saw it, and knew, yet could not reconcile himself to the approaching wo; and felt himself to be—unutterable anguish—the slayer of his chosen child. And seeing, knowing, feeling all this, it was his lot to deal the last blow to her gentle being, to launch Vol. II.—Y the last shaft that should ever rankle in her bosom with the envenomed barbs of mortal sorrow. Hewet, who, with Sir Henry Slingsby, had, on most positive, unquestionable proof, been condemned for conspiracy against the power and life of Oliver—whom party prejudice cannot deny to have been guilty of the intent to kill—an intent hindered only by premature discovery of their plot—nor the most jealous scrutiny discover to have been otherwise than justly executed—had been the preacher on whose ministry she had for many years attended; had united her to Claypole by the service of the church; had been her friend, her comforter, her teacher; and, looking on him only in these amiable and endearing lights, Elizabeth forgot to view him as the intended murderer of her father—argued in his behalf, half justified his crime under the plea of loyalty to his true king, prayed zealously and piteously for the remission of his punishment, and, finding all her supplications vain, mourned over him with so intense and terrible a storm of grief, that it half overcome her intellects, and quite wore out her frail and fading body. With a dull apathy Oliver heard at first that her life was despaired of—no sign of sorrow was displayed, scarcely of sense or feeling —but after a short space came the revulsion, the breaking up of all the vain restraints of pride, and stoicism, and man's affected hardihood—the loosing of the floodgates of the soul—the awful, vehement outpourings of a strong man's despair! From that day forth he left not her bedside, neither by day nor yet by night, tending her with all a woman's care, and, more than all, a woman's love. Soothing her every phantasy—feigning to be, or, it may be, persuading himself also that he would be, all she could wish him—praying and weeping with her. Nothing could be more beautiful, more pious, or more touching than the conduct of that gray-haired usurper, mourning as one that had no hope beyond her grave, beside his daughter's deathbed. But wretched as the consolation would have been, to have caught on his lips her last expiring sigh, to have felt reflected on his own the last glance of her glazing eyes—that wretched consolation was denied to him; for, as the body of his sweet child wasted, so did her mind wane likewise; and for many days before the termination of her sufferings she would at times burst into fits of the most frantic and insane delirium. These, as the time of her decease drew nearer, became more and more vehement and frightful; and it was strange that she, whose pains had ever seemed less bitter, or, at the least, more easily endured when her hand rested in her father's —now, at the sight of him she loved so dearly, nay, at the mere tones of his voice, or his suppressed and cautious footstep, started at once into the most furious paroxysms. “Blood! blood!” she would shriek, till the whole pile of Hampton court rang with her awful ravings—“I float, I smother in a sea—a sea of human blood! Who comes? who comes? red with the gore of monarchs—red with the slaughter of the saints? Father?—not father —no—no—oh, not my father!” and then again she would take up the cry, “Blood! blood!” struggling and wrestling on her couch as if amid the weltering waves, till those who watched about her were wellnigh distraught with terror, and till the boldest of her medical attendants, in the most positive terms, insisted on the absence of the despairing father from the sick chamber of his child. He withdrew silently, and with a quiet patience, that perfectly astonished those acquainted with the imperiousness of Cromwell's will—but he withdrew only from her deathbed to lie down upon his own. Shattered before by the incessant cares which he for many months had undergone, the whole weight of the government resting upon his single shoulders—relaxed by nervousness, suspicion, superstition, and remorse—this last blow broke him down. His old complaint, the ague—which had attacked him first in Scotland, and shaken, if it had not actually undermined, his constitution—returned upon him with redoubled violence, and, in a few days, brought him down to the very threshold of that dark house—the grave. But it was not, in truth, the ailment only of the corporeal shell—it was the intolerable burden “of that perilous stuff that weighs upon the heart!”—had the mind been at ease, the sickness of the body had been of small account! “The sorrows written on the brain were not to be razed out, nor the stuffed bosom cleansed!”—the scabbard, fretted long ago, was now, at length, worn out by the keen weapon that lay hid within it—the earthen jar was burst by the inscrutable workings of the liquor it contained— the pharos was consumed by the same fire which had for many a year been the sole agent of its glory! CHAPTER III. “Then happy low lie down! Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown!” King Henry IV. Part II. “The garlands wither on your brow, Then boast no more your mighty deeds; Upon death's purple altar now See where the victor victim bleeds. All hands must come To the cold tomb; Only the actions of the just Smell sweet, and blossom in the dust.” Shirley. It was already twilight on a sweet August evening, and the streets were fast growing thin, as the many-tongued and busy crowd, that had chafed and fretted throughout the day, like waves, in every channel of the great metropolis, gradually passed away, to seek for relaxation in their peaceful homes from all the cares, anxieties, and sorrows which had increased to them the heat and burden of their daily labours. A few, however, might be still seen studding in scattered groups the shadowy thoroughfares, some hurrying, as belated men, with hasty footsteps homeward, some loitering aimlessly along, as if to catch the pleasant coolness of the evening breeze. Among these groups was one, if it could properly be termed so, consisting of two persons; the one a man perhaps a little past the middle age, with soft and pensive features, and long light brown hair, waving in loose and scattered curls over the collar of his plain gray doublet—the other a boy, richly attired, as might beseem the page of a high family, upon whose shoulder the elder person leaned Y 2 somewhat heavily with his left hand, while with the right he moved a staff of ebony before him, as if to feel his way, for he was blind, although no scrutiny could have discovered any speck or blemish in the clear but cold gray eyes which, seeming to see all things, were, in truth, sealed up in rayless night. No words were interchanged between the pair as they passed onward to Whitehall at a pace suitable to the infirmity of the chief personage; but, when they reached the palace gate, the page spoke shortly in a low voice to the sentinel on duty—who was engaged in parleying with a gentleman on horseback, of military air and noble bearing—and was already passing in, when suddenly the stranger, who, it seemed, had been refused admittance, cast his eye on the boy's companion, and instantly addressed him. “Well met—and in good season,” he exclaimed; “if my eyes play me not a trick, my excellent friend Milton!” The blind man's countenance flashed with a joyous light as he replied—“Well met, indeed! well met, and welcome, after long years of absence; for sure I am mine ears deceive me not, though it be one whose accents I but little counted should ever greet them more—Sir Edgar Ardenne!” “It is, indeed!” answered the horseman. “After long years of wandering in the transatlantic wilds, I have at length turned my feet homeward; I landed only three days since at Portsmouth, and, riding with all diligence, have but this hour arrived in London. Right glad am I to see one of the two sole persons with whom I have now any ties on earth, so early, and, if I may judge from appearances, so well in health.” “I thank you!” answered the poet, grasping affectionately his friend's hand; “I thank you heartily; by His great mercy, and beside my one infirmity, I am sound, as I trust, both mind and body! But, tell me—for, in that I see you here, I judge who is the other person with whom you still esteem yourself united—can I do aught for you? I am, you know, his secretary?” “I would, if it were possible,” Sir Edgar answered, “see the protector—I owe him some amends, and would fain tell him how highly I esteem the fruits of his good government at home and his wise policy abroad. The soldier here on duty tells me that he is ill at ease, and has denied me entrance. I trust he is not seriously diseased.” The Latin secretary shook his head, and the expression of his countenance, so joyful at the recognition of his friend, altered perceptibly. “He is, indeed, much ailing—we trust not mortally; but his old ague hath returned on him, and what with that, and deep anxiety for Lady Claypole's health, and over-labouring in the service of the state, he is reduced so greatly that his physicians fear. Yet is he marvellously held up by faith in the Lord; and all his chaplains have assurance strongly impressed upon their hearts that he shall live, not die! I doubt not he will see you, and forthwith; for often hath he spoken of you recently, and as of one whom he once cherished greatly, and greatly regrets alway.” And, without farther words, he bade the page send some one straightway to lead hence Sir Edgar's horse, and to desire the chamberlain acquaint his highness that John Milton was below, with an old friend and comrade, even Sir Edgar Ardenne. After a few minutes, which the friends consumed pleasantly in slight though interesting conversation, a private of the guard relieved Sir Edgar of his horse, and shortly afterward an officer of the protector's household made his appearance, and, informing them that his highness was engaged at present in his meditations with worthy Master Peters and others of his chaplains, but that he shortly would find leisure to receive them, ushered them with no little courtesy into an antechamber, as Milton whispered to his friend, of the same suite which Oliver at present occupied. Nearly an hour passed away'before they received any farther word; but each of those congenial spirits had so much to hear and narrate to the other, that the moments did not lag, and it was with a feeling nearly akin to wonder that they heard the clocks striking ten just as the chamberlain announced to them the wish of the protector to see them in his chamber. They entered; and, propped up by cushions on his feverish bed, careworn, and hollow-cheeked, and heavy-eyed, and with a wild expression of anxiety and pain on his thin features, there lay the mighty being from whom Sir Edgar had last parted in the pride of manhood, in the plenitude of power, in the indomitable confidence of his own unresisted faculties. On one side of his pillow sat Hugh Peters, his familiar chaplain, a stern and gloomy-looking fanatic, intently occupied, as it would seem, in studying his pocket Bible; and on the other his wife, a lady of majestic bearing, although wanting somewhat in the easy dignity which is acquired only by residence from childhood upward in courtly circles, and two of her daughters, the ladies Falconbridge and Rich, who had been summoned from their sister's deathbed by an express, bearing tidings of their father's dangerous seizure. An air of deep gloom pervaded the apartment, and melancholy sat like a cloud upon the comely faces of the younger ladies, his wife repressing all outward demonstrations of disquiet in obedience to the wish of Oliver, who pertinaciously maintained that full assurance had been vouchsafed him from on high that he should yet be spared, until his usefulness should be completed to the Lord and to the people whom he had been placed in trust to govern for their good. Calm as he was, and self-restrained at all times, Ardenne could not so far command his voice as to prevent it trembling as he addressed his old commander, and a large tear rolled slowly down his cheek as he beheld the ravages which grief, and time, and terror had wrought on his expressive features and Herculean form. But Cromwell saw not the tear nor noticed the unusual tone of Edgar's salutation. As he perceived his chosen officer, a mighty gleam of exultation flashed over his worn lineaments, and his pale lip was curled with honest triumph. He well remembered, and had often pondered on the last words he had heard from the sincere and conscientious man who stood beside him; he knew his former doubts; he had interpreted aright his silence, his protracted absence; and now, that he had sought him out unsummoned, he felt the proud conviction that this man's mind was altered—that this late visit was a confession of his error—a token of his approbation and good-will. All this rushed on the dying sovereign's soul at once—and in the midst of pain, and doubt, and peril, he exulted! Exulted, that the only man in his whole realm whose disapproval he had dreaded, and whose applause he valued, had, by this long-delayed approach to reconciliation, sealed his avowal, that, in ruling England, he had ruled, not for his own aggrandizement, but for his people's welfare. “Ha! Edgar Ardenne!” he cried, in tones resembling more his ancient voice of power than any which, for many a mournful day, he had sent forth. “Though late, I greet thee—I rejoice to see thee —yea, as a trusty friend—a valued and long-lost companion! Varily hath it relieved me of well-nigh half my ailment to grasp this honest hand of thine, to hear once more the accents of a voice which no man ever heard to utter aught save words of truth and honour. I thank thee, good John Milton, that thou hast brought to me this—I had well-nigh said—this son. Surely, though not a prodigal, for him shall there be slain a fatted calf, and that right early.” Again Ardenne was much affected, so much that Oliver perceived it; and pressing Edgar's hand, which he had still retained in his own burning grasp, “Think not,” he said, “so gravely of this matter. 'Tis but a little sickness—a paltry fever. Surely we two have ridden on such real perils, and ridden, though I say it, with an unblenching heart and a calm brow, that it is not for us to quake and tremble in the soul if that a petty ague shake these our mortal sinews. I tell thee, man, the Lord hath heard our prayer—mine, and these holy men's—He hath yet need of me in mine appointed place on earth—nor will he yet yield up his servant into the jaws of death. I tell thee, years are yet before us —years full of usefulness, and happiness, and glory —and we will part no more. Thou wilt not leave me any more, Sir Edgar?” “Not on this side the grave,” Ardenne replied. “When last we parted, I was—I own it—blinded! blinded by wrongful and unmerited suspicion. I thought you selfish and ambitious—I foresaw that you must be the ruler of this land, and I fancied that to be so had been the aim and object of your life! that you had wrested circumstance to your advantage—made time and tide your slaves. I own I was in error—and, with me, to own is to repair. The elder Charles was, I confess, unfit to reign, unfit to live! for, had he lived, we must have warred with him for ever. He dead—there was no choice save between you and a republic! and pardon me that I believed it your intent to seize the reins of government at once on the king's death; and that, believing so, I deemed your agency in that great trial as mere deceit and fraud. Justly, however— honestly—you suffered the experiment to work; and had the people been—as in my poor opinion never people were nor will be while this universe exists—capable of self-government, fit to elect their rulers, or willing to submit to laws of their own making, they had been still self-governed, and, as they term it, free! I thank God that they are so no longer. Better, far better—if it must be so—one tyrant than ten thousand. But you, sir, are no tyrant; but the sagest, boldest, and most prosperous monarch that ever yet has governed Britons. Dreaded abroad, honoured at home, you have indeed, as you did prophecy to me long years ago— you have indeed caused the mere name of Englishman to be as greatly and as widely honoured as ever was the style of antique Roman. You know that I nor flatter nor deceive, but always speak straight onward. I owed you reparation for unjust suspicion, and I have made it. So far, then, we are quits! Now, then, as to the man who has made England mightier, freer, happier than ever she has been before—as to the undisputed and only fitting ruler of the soil, I tender you my service and allegiance!” “True friend! true friend!” cried Cromwell. “You, and you only, have judged of me, and have judged aright—the boldness of your former censure confirms the frankness of your present praise! You only dared upbraid me with ambition—you only envy not the greatness which has been thrust upon me. Surely, could England have been free, and tranquil, and at peace, never had I sat on this thorny eminence; but the Lord willed it so; and, as he wills, it must be. I thank you, and most cordially do I accept your service, and frankly do I tell you it will avail me much—for you I may trust, and, save only you and excellent John Milton, I know not any other. The heathen have come round about me, and digged pits, and wove snares on every side!—traitors are in my guard!—false prophets in my chamber!—spies and assassins everywhere!— daggers around my pillow!—and ratsbane in my cup! Yet, by the Lord's help, have I set them all at naught; and confident am I that he will not abandon me. Truly, of all his mercies, none do I esteem more wonderful than this, that he hath given me once more in you a friend after mine own heart and a faithful coadjutor!” The veteran's eye kindled as he spoke, and his cheek wore a healthful colour, and his voice sounded with all its wonted firmness; it was, indeed, as he himself had worded it, as if one half his ailment had been banished by this most opportune and unexpected visit from the man whom, perhaps alone, he truly loved and honoured. There is no truth more certain, than that those most practised in deceit themselves most sensibly perceive and fully honour the absence of deceit in others; and it may be that Cromwell, who was unquestionably, in some sort, though, for the most part, self-deceived, a deceiver of the world, admired Ardenne for that very frankness of bold honour which he himself possessed not. It may be, also, that, misguided by his wild fanatical opinions, he at one time, believing himself the object of immediate inspiration, looked on his own worst actions as his brightest deeds; and at another, when the dark fit succeeded to the fancied vision, brooded despairingly over his own misdoings, till he conceived himself entirely reprobate and outcast. Doubtful and wavering, then, in his own sense of right in his own conscience, how natural that he should draw deep comfort to his unquiet soul from the assurance that a man, whom he knew to have perused his heart more narrowly than any living being, and to have judged of him at one time with such harshness as to abandon him, now looked on his career with an approving eye—now bade him hail as the protector of his country's honour—now tendered his allegiance, and professed his willingness to follow wherever he should lead. How natural that he should feel this as a confirmation of that which he would fain believe—as a proof to himself of his own half-suspected honesty. Such were, it is most probable, the causes of the almost supernatural effect produced on Oliver by the return of Ardenne; and, truly, it was wellnigh supernatural! Till a late hour of the night he kept him by his side, conversing cheerfully, nay, almost joyously, on his own future prospects, on the advancement of his country's interest abroad, on the diffusion of intelligence and of religion, which is philosophy, at home! And Ardenne, who—feeling that he had wronged Cromwell in his first suspicion, when he expected him to seize the sceptre immediately upon the death of Charles; convinced that, when he had usurped that sceptre, he was entirely justified in wresting it from the vile faction which was plunging England into misery and madness; perceiving that he had in all things used his acquired power with wisdom, justice, and moderation, for the present welfare and the future glory of his people—had rushed, perhaps, too hastily to the conclusion Vol. II.—Z that he had acted in all things, and from the first, on motives purely patriotic—Ardenne responded to his cheerful mood; and amid pleasant memories of those past evils, which it is often pleasurable to contemplate when we are safe and happy, and high anticipations for the future, the hours wore onward, and midnight was announced from many a steeple, and yet that friendly conclave thought not of separation. At that dead hour of the night a guarded step was heard without the door, and an attendant, entering, called out the Lady Cromwell; and she, after an absence of some small duration, returned far paler than before, and with the traces of fresh tears upon her cheek, and whispered Lady Falconbridge, who, in turn, left the chamber for a while, and, coming back, again called out her sister. It was most strange that this dumb show continued for so long a time, that Ardenne, and even the blind poet, perceived that something must be seriously amiss, ere Cromwell noticed it. He was, however, so much reinvigorated, his spirits had so wondrously regained their elasticity, that he talked on, and smiled, and even jested, until so deep a gloom had fallen on his auditors, infected by the evident and hopeless sorrow engraved in characters so legible upon the wo-begone and pallid face of Lady Cromwell, that he could not continue longer in his happy ignorance. “Ha! What is this?” he cried, looking around from face to face in blank bewilderment. “What is to do? Speak out, I say,” he gasped; his voice, which had but lately been so strong, now scarcely audible—“Ardenne, speak out—you never have deceived me;” and then, before he could receive an answer, had it been possible for Edgar to have answered, as his eye met his wife's, “I see,” he said, “I see,” in tones resigned, but inexpressibly sad and heartbroken. “Elizabeth is dead! my daughter, oh my daughter!” Gradually he sank down from the pillows, upon which he had been raised in a half-sitting posture, and, though he struggled hard still to maintain his wonted and severe composure, the effort was too great for his enfeebled frame. For a few seconds' space he was successful; then stretching out his wasted arms while his teeth chattered in his head, and all his limbs shook as if palsied, and the large scalding tears poured down his hollow cheeks—“My God,” he cried, “my God—why—why hast thou forsaken me!” He pulled the coverlet about his temples, turned his face to the wall, and burst into an agony of sobs, and groans, and fierce convulsions, that haunted Edgar's ears long after he had left the apartment of the bereaved and dying parent. CHAPTER IV. “Beneath His fate the moral lurks of destiny; His day of double victory and death Beheld him win two realms, and happier yield his breath.” Childe Harold. It was the third day of September—the anniversary of Worcester, of Dunbar—the lucky day of Cromwell—the day marked out, as he believed, by planetary influence—the day whereon he never yet had undertaken aught but he therefrom had reaped a golden harvest! and it would have appeared, indeed, to any who beheld the conflict of the elements that day, that something of great import to the nations was portended. For, at the earliest dawn, the skies were overspread with a deep lurid crimson, and the sun rose, although there was no mist on the horizon, like a huge ball of heated metal, dim, rayless, and discoloured; and, as he rose, the unchained winds went forth, raving and howling through the skies with such strange fury, as not the oldest men could liken or compare to aught they had themselves beheld or heard of from their fathers. The largest trees were uptorn from their earthfast roots, and hurled like straws before the whirlwind; chimneys and turrets toppled and crashed incessantly; cattle were killed in open fields by the mere force of the elements; the seas were strewn with wrecks; the lands were heaped with ruin. Nor did these prodigies occur in one realm only, or in one degree of latitude; from north to south, from east to west, the same strange tempest swept over every shore of Europe, and at the selfsame hour, marking its path with desolation. The same blast dashed the vessels of the hardy Norsemen against their steril rocks, and plunged Italian argosies into the vexed depths of the Adriatic!—the same blast shivered the pine-tree on the Dofrafells, and the cypress by the blue waves of the Bosphorus! Thunder, and rain, and hail, and the contending fury of the winds, shifting and veering momently from point to point round the whole compass, and the incessant streams of “fire from heaven,” united to make up a scene of horror such as the Christian world had never perhaps beheld either before or since; and, amid that strange din and warfare, the parting soul of him who had so swayed the mightier influence of human passions to his will, who had so ridden fearlessly through the more murderous, if less appalling, strife of human warfare, was struggling to take wing—to flee away and be at rest! On the preceding night all his physicians had pronounced his cure impossible—his dissolution speedy and certain; for, since the death of his beloved daughter, he had not closed an eye by night, or enjoyed any intermission from the recurring fits of ague and of fever—yet still his preachers buoyed him up with their insane and impious blasphemies, asserting that the Lord, even the Lord who cannot lie, had promised them that this his servant should recover—and even when the mortal pains had yielded to the weakness of approaching death, they still forbade him to fear aught or to make any preparation. On the preceding evening, seeing the tribulation and alarm depicted on the anxious features of his wife, he took her kindly by the hand, and said, “Fear not for me, my love, nor think that I shall die; I am sure of the contrary.” “Oh, sir,” said Ardenne, in reply, who, since their reconciliation, had scarcely left his pillow for a moment, “oh, sir, believe it not—they are no friends to you who would deceive you any longer—your trust must be on High, for you have wellnigh done with earth. Not one of your physicians believes you can outlive to-morrow. They that would tell you otherwise have lost their reason.” “Say not,” he instantly replied, “that I have lost my reason; I tell you the plain truth. I know it from authority far better than any you can have from Galen or Hippocrates. It is the answer of the Lord himself to our prayers; not to mine only, but to those of others—others who have an interest with Him more close and intimate than I have. Go on, then, cheerfully, and, banishing all sorrow from your looks, deal with me as with a serving man. Ye may have skill in the nature of Z 2 things, yet nature can do more than all physicians put together; and God is far more above nature!” It was in vain that Edgar, who could not endure that he should go hence in this wild and terrible delusion, argued with him, professing his sincerity with tears, and urging on him the necessity of immediate preparation, unless he would rush headlong into his Maker's presence, unhouselled and unshriven! It was in vain that he remonstrated with the fanatical and blinded monitors, who, to the last, assured their victim of speedy restoration. By Peters, Sterry, and the rest, he was rebuked as an unthinking carnal-minded person, setting at naught the intimations of the Holy One, a scoffer, and blasphemer!—and Cromwell was admonished to put from him one whose presence in his chamber might well draw down upn its inmate some dread maifestation of Divine displeasure; but to this Oliver objected so decidedly that they dared urge it no farther. “He is sincere,” he answered to their exhortations; “sincere, but in much error! The Lord hath not vouchsafed to him the light which guides our footsteps—yet he is most sincere, and pure according to his lights, and so—although those lights be darkened—more justified, it may well be, than we, who have more opportunities of grace and less excuse for sin! He shall not leave me. Tush! Tell me not—I say he shall not! Begone, all ye —he shall alone be near me!” His will was instantly obeyed, and through the livelong night Sir Edgar watched beside his bed; and on that night, for the first time since Lady Claypole's death, did sleep visit his weary eyes—but sleep how terrible—not the “soft nurse of nature,” but its convulsion! As his eyes closed in slumber the delusions which he cherished while awake forsook him, and death, in all its terrors, glared on him face to face! His features, bold still and firm, though pallid and emaciate, were frightfully distorted by the agonies of terror and despair—the sweat stood in dark beaded bubbles on his brow, and his thin hair seemed, to the sight of the excited watcher, to bristle on his head—his hands were cast abroad like those of a man drowning, and the whole bed was shaken by the convulsive shivering of his limbs. “Keep them away!” he cried, in words painfully clear and thrilling, “keep them away! What would they with me? No! no! I am not ready—I will not—do they not hear me say, I will not die?” and he ground his teeth violently, and struggled as with persons striving to drag him down. Appalled beyond expression, Sir Edgar touched him gently, and he awoke; but, still unconscious and bewildered, he continued for a moment to resist and utter, “Avaunt! Get thee behind me! for what have I to do with thee, thou Evil One?” Then, recognising Ardenne, he forced a feeble smile, and muttering something of a fearful dream, composed himself again to rest, and, after a few moments, was again asleep. But instantly again the vision came upon him; and this time his eyes were opened wide, and stared abroad as if awake. “Away with it,” he gasped; “away with that bloodstained and headless trunk! Why dost thou glare on me, thou discrowned spirit; thou canst not say I judged thee? King! king!—there be no kings in England—the man, the man Charles Stuart! Beseech me not, I say—I cannot save thee! It falls! it falls! that deadly-gleaming axe! Ha! ha! said I not so—there be no kings in England?” Again he woke, and once again, after a little time, sunk into a perturbed and restless slumber, which lasted, although fitful and uneasy, until the morning cocks had crown. Then, with a start that raised him from his pillow, “Devil!” he muttered, through his clinched teeth; “ha, devil, was it thou? thou that didst break my childish sleep, telling me I should be the First in England? thou that didst plunge my stainless soul in blood—oceans of blood? my king's—my people's—my own child's? Blood! blood!” he shrieked aloud, and once more Edgar touched him; but, as he was aroused, unwilling to encounter or abash him, he feigned himself to sleep, and heard him say, “Happy! Oh! how innocent and happy! Lo! how serene he slumbers. But it was a dream—a foul dream only.” For a time he kept silence, but once or twice groaned deeply: and, after a little while, Ardenne beheld him through his half shut lids raise himself on his knees, and, with clasped hands, pour forth a prayer befitting rather, as Ludlow afterward observed when it was found transcribed among his papers, “a mediator's than a sinner's deathbed!” “Lord,” he exclaimed, “although I am a wretched and a miserable creature, I am in convenant with thee through grace; and I may, I will come unto thee for thy people. Thou hast made me a mean instrument to do them some good and thee service; and many of them have set too high a value on me, though others wish and would be glad of my death. But, Lord, however thou dost dispose of me, continue to go on to do good for them. Give them consistency of judgment, one heart, and mutual love; and go on to deliver them, and with the work of reformation, and make the name of Christ glorious throughout the world. Teach those who look too much upon thy instruments to depend more upon thyself. Pardon such as desire to trample upon the dust of a poor worm, for they are thy people too; and pardon the folly of this short prayer, for Jesus Christ his sake, and give us a good night if it be thy pleasure.” Having, to the unspeakable astonishment of Ardenne— who, when he saw him rise, expected a confession of his crimes and an appeal for pardon—poured forth these strange ejaculations, he laid him down, and slept a calm, and, as it seemed, refreshing sleep, until the first beams of the lurid sun shone into the apartment; then, starting up again, “Hell!' he shrieked out; “hell hath gat hold upon me; the pains of hell have compassed me!” and would have leaped out of bed upon the floor if Edgar had not caught him in his arms. At the same moment the awful uproar of the tempest burst suddenly and without warning upon the terrified and reeling world. But the storm fell unheeded on the ears of Oliver and of his sole attendant; both were too deeply moved, the one by the remembrance of his tremendous dreams, the other by compassion, pity, and dismay, to think of any thing external. In a short time, however, Oliver regained his wonted calmness; and, making no allusion to the occurrences of the past night, Edgar disturbed him not by speaking of them. As the day now advanced, his wife, his children, some of his officers, and all his chaplains crowded into his chamber; he spoke to all kindly and cheerfully; but Edgar saw that all the overweening confidence of the preceding day had left him; and though the fanatics continued to rave in his ears, promising present health and future glory, he listened with indifference, and his eye no longer flashed at their bold prophecies, nor did he answer any thing, nor prophesy at all himself, though called on frequently throughout the day by Peters to say something to the Lord, and to make intercession. For the most part he lay still upon his back, with his hands folded on his breast, and his face perfectly composed and calm; but twice or thrice a short quick spasm twitched the muscles of his mouth—and once he wrung his hands, perhaps unconsciously. He spoke but seldom, and then only in short sentences, evidently growing weaker every moment. Once he remarked upon the day —his anniversary—but, strange to tell, he noticed not at all the furious tempest which shook the very palace-roof above him, and, saving in its lulls, drowned every sound of voice or motion. Toward noon he dozed a little while, and on his waking called to Peters. “Tell me,” he said, “I pray you—and, on your life here and hereafter, I charge you tell me truly —for, look you, 'tis a grievous thing to lie unto a man situate like to me—can one who hath been once in grace fall off by any means, and ever become reprobate thereafter, so as to peril his salvation?” “Surely he cannot!” answered the fanatic. “He that is once in grace can never more back-slide, nor fall, nor even falter! All that he doth thereafter is of grace, and, therefore, holy!—his life is precious—his salvation certain!” “Soh!” answered the dying man; “I then am safe—for sure I am that once I was in grace!” Shocked beyond all expression, Edgar would fain have once again renewed his exhortations; but, just as he began, Cromwell asked for his family; embraced them one by one, and almost instantly sank into a state of lethargic stupor, from which no efforts of his now alarmed attendants could rouse him. At length, just as the clock was striking three, a louder crash of thunder than any of the claps which had rolled almost incessantly throughout the day broke on the melancholy silence! “Cannon!” he muttered, faintly, as he woke, the sound commingling with his recollections of the day. “Lambert, bring up the cannon! Charge there—charge with your pikes, valiant and trusty Goff!” “His mind is at Dunbar,” whispered one of the military men to Ardenne; “but, lo! wherefore do they torment him?” The question was produced by a late effort on the part of some about his person to induce the dying ruler to declare who should succeed him. To a direct straightforward question he gave no answer; then he was asked, should Richard be the next protector, and a faint motion of his head— casual, as it seemed to Ardenne, and unmeaning— was construed to imply assent. A little longer he gasped feebly, without speaking. Another crash of thunder appeared to split the very firmament, and the blue flickering lightning fearfully glanced upon the dying soldier's pale stern features. They kindled in the glare, and the eye flashed, and the hand was waved aloft. “Oh!” he exclaimed; “on, Ironsides! Down with the sons of Zeruiah!” Then, in a feebler tone, “Ha!” he continued, “have at thee! What, again? Dismounted— oh! dismounted! Ho! rescue—help—help! Ardenne—lost! lost!—Ardenne!—help!—resc—” The sharp death-rattle cut short the unfinished word—the eyeballs glazed—the lifted hand sank nerveless—the jaw dropped! The strife was over. Ambition, energy, sagacity, and valour won for the great usurper naught but a broken heart and an untimely grave! There was a deep hush in the chamber, awfully solemn and impressive! A woman's sob first broke the spell—and then the voice of his first follower —last friend! “There passed the spirit of the greatest man England has ever seen! Peace to his soul! His faults die with him! but never— never, while the round world endures, shall his fame be forgotten, or the good he hath done his country pass away! Weep, England, weep—your benefactor is no more—and I foresee much strife, much anarchy, much blood!—but he who hath gone hence hath sown the seed—the seed of thy prosperity, thy freedom, and thy glory—and thou shalt reap the harvest, thou and thy sons, for many a deathless age, when he who now is nothing—and I who mourn above him—shall be dust unto dust, and ashes unto ashes!” THE END.</field>
