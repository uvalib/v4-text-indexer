A Fog-bank in August—the `Trader'—the Shipper and his Crew—`Parson Peart—Billy Biddle and his shipmate Seth Pinkham—Porpoises —a Kennebec Merchant—sketch of Passengers— a probable Heroing and two possible Heroe—Peril and Escape—the Light-house—the Scenery of the Mist—the Fog-Lifts—the scene around the Voyagers—arrival at T. Wharf—entrance into the City—arrival at the N. E. Coffee House. Our story opens on one of those singularly beautiful mornings which the coast of New-England presents in the month of August, when the fogs, having for some time resisted the unclouded splendor of the sun's rays, begin to lift and break, and roll seaward in majestic volumes, ascending as they move, until they rest in the calm blue bosom of heaven. It was on such a morning in August, 182—, before steamboats had taken the place of packet-sloops, that a `Kennebec trader' lay off the harbor of Boston, completely enveloped in a fogbank. She was a pretty-painted sloop, and carried, in addition to her huge mainsail and wide jib, a flying topsail, while at her mast-head hung a green flag, which, when, at intervals, it was spread out by the light east wind, showed the name `Aurora' displayed conspicuously in red letters on a yellow ground. The fog was so dense, that no object could have been seen twice the sloop's length. A slight wind just rippled the surface of the slow-heaving ground-swell, on which the sloop rocked with a flapping mainsail and rattling blocks. On her deek was a cargo of staves and new barrels, piled to the fifth rattling of her shrouds. On the top of this load was perched a little black caboose, at which an old negro was cooking breakfast, and from which the fumes of fried pork and potatoes floated astern with the abundant smoke, affording to the skipper at the helm a grateful precursor of what was to come.— A space on the quarter deck round the companion way had been left clear for the better accommodation, when on deck, of sundry passengers which the skipper had taken in at Bath and Augusta, towns on the Kennebec river, whence, three days before, he had taken his daparture, bound for Boston. As yet, none of them had made their appearance from the cabin. The skipper in his narrow-brimmed chip hat, fastened by a lanyard to the button-hole of a tarry roundabout, his horny sunbrowned hand, grasping the carved knob of the crooked necked tiller, stood with one eye shut and the other half-a-peep, peering through the fog, his hand hollowed back of his left ear, listening for surge shore ward, or the noise of any vessel that might chance to be in his vicinity.— Forward were gathered his crew, consisting of Parson Pearl the cook, who had in his better days `held forth' at camp-meetings—an old, grey-headed, good-natured, rum-loving negro, who like all old blacks, had been a servant of `massa Washington.' A blue greasy cotton cap, which served him in divers capacities in his office of cook, was stuck on to the top of his grizzly locks, save when he took it off to rub the coat of a potatoe, wipe a knife, clean out a cup, or fan his coals into a flame. A long-tailed blue, marvellously torn and patched, and of a fashion ten years gone, graced his back, while a pair of breeches that had belonged to an antiquated medical gentleman, whom he had once lived with in the village from whence the sloop sailed, encased his legs; for the calves of which, nature herself furnished a pair of shining black hose. With a grave and solemn visage, such as became the important business in which he was engaged, that of cutting potatoes into thin slices for frying, Parson Pearl sat in the midst of his cloud of smoke, feeling all the responsibility of his position. Lolling over the windlass, listlessly watching him, were a man about twenty-eight years old and a half-grown boy—the sloop's crew. The elder was a slop-sided, lank-looking Kennebecker, with long straight hair pulled down over his eyes, a quid of tobacco in his cheek, a rusty belt top stuck upon the back of his head, and who rejoiced in the name of Seth Pinkham 3d, The other was a thick, short, white headed varlet, with a fat face and round belly, and a twinkling blue eye full of mischief. He was dressed in full canvass trowsers, blue shirt, and black scarf loosely knotted about his neck, wore white socks, and pumps; and sported a ring on his little finger. The hair on each temple was twisted with a long corkscrew curl, which he was fond of playing with, and always admiring with great self complaceney.— He was a regular lad-seaman in his appearance and dress, and a foul anchor imprinted with India ink into his wrist, and the initials of some lass ashore done upon his fair white neck, rendered visible by the gaping of his shirt bosom, showed that he was a true `salt' in embryo. Billy Biddle —for such was his name—had been at sea two voyages to Europe, and was now working his passage up to Boston, after a short visit to his mother at Hallowell, to ship again on a foreign voyage. Slowly the sloop glided through the mist in which she was enveloped. At intervals, the blue sky could be seen overhead, but the fog lay upon the water impenetrable. The skipper, old captain Ansel Nye, in vain looked and listened, while cautiously and auxiously he let his little sloop move steadily onward. His compass told him that he was going westward, and he knew by his running that he must be up with the `Graves,' or very near them. So he stood on, depending more upon his ear than upon his eye. `Don't you hear breakers, Mr. Pinkham?' he suddenly asked with anxiety. `It's the Parson's pertaters a-sizzlin,' sir, said Bill, before Seth could uncoil his tongue. `Now dem's a nation slander o' Bill's, massa skipper,' responded Pearl from his caboose—taking off his blue cotton cap and wiping the perspiration from his forehead; `I'se nebber fry pataty vot sizzle so leetle. Real kennebecker wegetable, and no water in em. You lie, white boy, you tell skipper nigger's fryin pan sizzle like de breaker! It am de breaker, mas' skipper, I hear `um!' and old Pearl stuck a tin pot against his ear to catch the sound. `He break dar' or nigger nebber know what breaker am.' `I guess there's sumthin or nuther, captain,' said Seth; `there's a mighty noise away here; and Mr. Pinkham stretched forth his arm and pointed in a direction two points off the starboard bow. `That's where I thought I heard it. Hark! it is a plain surging of the sea! we are coming near breakers!' `It's a porpoise blowing,' said Bill; `hear him now!' All listened; and the noise coming nearer and clearer, the skipper was satisfied that it was a shoal of porpoises; the next moment they were heard close at hand, blowing and floundering, and all at once they made their appearance, coming out of the fog within a few fathoms of the sloop, and making directly across her bows! As they floundered past with loud blowing, and a tumultuous dashing of the waves, the passengers rushed on deck with great alarm visible on their countenances, only in time to discover the black dorsal fin and round shining back of the last one of the train disappearing in the mist to leeward. `Bless us! what was that, captain?' cried a portly country gentleman in his shirt sleeves, his coat on his arm, one boot on his foot and the other in his hand. `Old Neptune, sir,' said Billy pertly, `come to tell old Pearl he should call for him this time next year.' `Debill cotch you, youngster, `fore massa Nep' come for trouble ole nigger,' said Pearl, retorting; `it be a scool ob sea-hog, massa Harefoot,' he added, replying in a respectful tone to the alarmed gentleman with a coat on his arm. `A sea-hog!' repeated the country merchant; `I have heard of sea-lawyers, but never that I remember of sea-hogs.' `The Parson means porpoises,' said the skipper, his weather-beaten visage slightly relaxing with a smile. `Oh, ah! porpoises. I thought we might have encountered a whale. It was a terrible noise, captain, hey? You seamen have a perilous profession. For my part, I shall be glad when I get to the end of this voyage. Nothing, but to see my son safely in a store in Boston would have brought me up in a vessel; but the route by stage for two is so expensive. Dear me! well, I am glad it is no worse! Why, what a fog! How can you see to steer? Where are we?' inquired the inquisitive and very much perplexed Mr. Harefoot. `Near the Graves,' answered the skipper. `Near our graves! Good heavens, Captain Nye!' exclaimed the portly gentleman, hastily drawing on his other boot; `how can you talk so coolly? Is there no way of escape?' The skipper then briefly explained that the graves he meant were a reef of rocks, so called from Admiral Graves, who there lost one of his ships. This explanation greatly relieved the apprehensions of the portly gentleman, who, learning that they were in no imminent danger, began to inspect the operations of Parson Pearl, and to inhale with peculiar gratification the savoury odor that floated aft. In a few minutes the rest of the passengers were dressed and on deck, and Pearl went below to clear up and set the table for breakfast. Besides Mr. Harefoot, who was a respectable merchant in the town of Augusta, there were four other passengers. One of these was his son, a good-looking, if not handsome youth of seventeen, dressed for shore, in a new olive coat, cut exceeding short in the waist, with a high cotton-velvet collar; a garment made by the Kennebec tailor with an eye to its being sported in Washington street, and therefore was in the best fashion known to him; blue silk vest with gilt buttons, a blue cravat, and pantaloons off the same piece with his coat, with a narrow, high crowned, long furred hat, completed his costume; which for the region from whence he came was a very dandish one, and therefore had not been mounted until this morning, with the prospect of soon being in Boston, where its merits could be appreciated. His father had kept him at the `Hook' Academy with Preceptor Green till he though; him fitted to place in a store, for which end he was now conducting him up to Boston; his greatest ambition being to see his son one day a great Boston merchant. Henry Harefoot was a youth of good habits, and, save a fondness for dress and judging of others too much by what they had on, he had as few faults as could be expected in a boy just from school. His father was a worldly-minded man, and only looked to his boy's getting rich; but his mother had a high sense of parental responsibility, and therefore, educated her son religiously, and impressed upon his expanding mind moral and religious truth. Henry, therefore, grew up a conscientious boy; and at this time an oath, a lie, a vulgar and indecent word, were strangers to his tongue. He had naturally a good mind, which he had cultivated by reading, of which he was extravagantly fond; his sensibilities were quick, his heart generous, and his disposition social: in fine, he possessed at the time we introduce him to the reader on his passage to Boston, all the elements of a good and useful if not eminent man. He looked forward to his visit to Boston and his residence there as apprentice (or `clerk,' as it is termed in courtesy,) to some merchant, with emotions of pleasure and hopes that gilded all the future. Another of the passengers was a plain, respectable-looking man, with his son and daughter; the former a youth about the age of Henry Harefoot, and the sister about a year and a half younger. Mr. Wentworth, the father, was a hatter, and had quite a large establishment, which brought him in a comfortable income; but as he had a large family of children, he was under the necessity, to do justice to all, to place them, as they became old enough, in some employment. He had already three sons bound out to different trades, and a daughter keeping school. He was now taking the two with him to find situations for them; for Pierce with some respectable master carpenter, and for Isabel with a lady-like milliner who had formerly lived in Augusta, and whom he knew very well. Pierce was an intelligent looking youth, with a pleasing expression when he spoke, and an air of frankness that was prepossessing and invited confidence. He was dressed in a plain suit of blue cassimere, coarse but neat, and perfectly fitting his fine form. His sister was a pretty, laughing-eyed brunette, of that soft, olive tint rarely found in New England and supposed peculiar to Louisiana. Her form was just developing, and already foretold the ripe loveliness mature womanhood would unfold. She was a beautiful child of nature, all too guileless to be trusted from beneath a guardian father's eye or far removed from a protecting mother's arm. The remaining passenger was Mr. George Washington St. John Leighton, a young man just from Bowdoin College, returning to his father, who was a distiller in Boston, his diplomaed head filled with Latin and fluxions, his fingers loaded with rings, a silver watch in his fob, and a proud opinion of his own importance prevading his soul. During the passage, scarcely had he deigned to unbend himself save to Isabel Wentworth, whom he annoyed by his gaze and disgusted by his barefaced flattery. Such were the passengers and crew of the sloop `Aurora' as she lay off Boston Harbor waiting for the fog to lift; and as some of them may make their appearance hereafter in our story, we have been thus particular in naming them. `Does the mist lift any, Captain?' asked Mr. Wentworth, as they stood on deck, looking ahead into the fog. `Not that I perceive,' answered the skipper, looking above and around him. Silently they glided on for a few minutes, when they were startled by the sharp rattling of blocks at a short distance from them in the fog to windward, the creaking and chafing of yards, and a low rippling sound, as if a vessel was passing through the water. Quicker than thought the skipper put the helm hard up, sprung to the main sheet and let it go, and at the top of his lungs, shouted, `Luff, luff, or you'll be aboard. Cast off that jib sheet, Mr. Pinkham,' and then with his eyes fixed to windward with anxious apprehension, the skipper put his vessel off free. `Luff it is,' had instantly and startingly been returned through the fog; and the swaying of yards and the drawing of cordage was heard; and the next instant, moving like a speetre ship through the mist, a stately brig glided astern to leeward, and vanished scarcely ere she was seen Every eye was turned upon the spirit-like structure—every heart ceased beating with suspense, till the imminent danger disappeared with her. `That was a narrow escape, captain,' said the portly passenger, drawing in a long breath and emitting it again with great relief; `if he had struck us we should have gone to the bottom.' The skipper made no reply—his ear was intent on catching some sound ahead. Suddenly old Pearl, who was conveying the breakfast from his caboose to the cabin, uttered an exclamation of surprise, dropped a plate of fried onions upon the barrels over which he was walking, and pointing upward, cried, `Got a' massy, mas' Skipper, look dar.' The skipper's eye followed the upward direction of the astounded African's, and to his astonishment he beheld, almost over the mast head, towering high in air, the black cap of the light-house, like the giant of the mist. `Ready about,' he shouted; and the sloop, obeying her helm, turned her bowsprit aside from the cliff, which now appeared close ahead lifting its rocky battlements, black and fearful, high in the air, and just in time to save herself. With glad emotions, the passengers as well as the skipper watched the light-house, which had shot itself high above the fog, once more received into its bosom. This imminent danger had not been without its advantage, by giving the skipper accurate knowledge of his situation; and he now felt that he could lay his course into port without having any thing to apprehend but the danger of falling foul of other vessels. As the sun got more power the mist became lighter, and removed at a farther distance from the sloop, which, having cleared the light-house point, was gliding easily along before a gentle wind, steered by compass and ear. After they had breakfasted and come on deck, the passengers were surprised to see that the sun-rays penetrating through a clear space above, had created two brilliant rainbows in the mist off either bow While Isabel Wentworth was admiring their evervarying beauty, the fog as if by magic fell down upon the sea, reaching only the tops of numerous islands, and the upper masts and sails of many vessels all around them. Never had she seen a sight so strange and beautiful. The thick silvery fog lay upon the top of the water about ten feet in height from its surface, which was but a little below her eye, appearing like that of a superincumbent ocean, gently undulating as the real ocean heaved underneath. The sun shining upon it gave it life and beauty, and the vessels, every where seen sailing through it, seemed half-foundered yet still moving, all presenting a most singular appearance. Here was a sail boat so low buried that its little red penant was visible skipping along the top of the mist like some living creature inhabiting this new element; there a ship, visible only to her hull appeared like three stately masts walking the sea. The islands seemed to float, and all presented new and strange forms to the mariner's eye, and forms of grace and beauty to all. This beautiful picture lasted but a few minutes. The wind came in from seaward and soon this misty ocean heaved and oplifted itself, parted in vast mssses, opening between vistas to the land and the sea, and gradually retiring unveiled islands, fleets, and fortresses, with the far off city and its hundred towers! Soon the last lingering cloud-wreath had left the top of the loftiest island, and what was a short time before reposing on the sea, the ocean's veil which the fiery sun had so long striven to lift, was now sailing the mid sky in troops of fleecy clouds or suspended in majestic drapery along the horizon. The scene that the lifting of the misty curtain presented to the eyes of the voyagers was beautiful beyond imagination. Green islands adorned with villas, or crowned with fortresses or smooth and verdant like a well kept lawn, rose on every side softening as they receded in the distance and blended with the blue sky or bluer sea. Before them a league distant towered the city of Boston, the stately queen of the fair empire of isle and ocean, a dome for her coronet, her sceptre a hundred glittering spires, a sparkling belt of waters her girdle and her seat a tri-pillard throne. As our young voyagers approached the metropolis of New England they seemed to want a hundred eyes to view the thousand ever changing objects that continually presented themselves. The neat snow white castle Independence with its green glacis and black cannon mounted in the gaping embrasures; the frowning fortress on the opposite island; the heights of Dorehester associated with such stirring revolutionary incidents on one hand and Bunker Hill with its thrilling story of deadly struggle on the other, were objects of deep interest. All that they had read of Boston and its environs in the history of their native land now rushed upon their faithful memories, and to their warm and fresh vision every scene was living and glowing with the life of the past. Henry gazed in silence and deep joyful emotion that at intervals found its vent in an exclamation. Pierce Wentworth, while he enjoyed the view, explained to his listening sister every scene as one after the other they were pointed out to him by his father. Mr. Harefoot was too busy shaving and sprucing up, to make a good appearance in the city before the Boston merchants, of whom he four times a year bought his goods, to come on deck to look at the magnificent panorama through which they were moving, and Henry had to get his information from the skipper or old Pearl who very cheerfully and with great pride pointed out to him the several objects of interest. Harry might have learned from Mr. Wentworth if he had chosen; but, let it be mentioned here that in Augusta there were two castes of society; regulated by the merchants, lawyers, doctors, elergymen and idle rich people, of which they constituted themselves in the first; and mechanies, captains of vessels and poor useful men in the second. In the first caste Mr. Harefoot and wife included themselves, and in the second they placed Mr. Wentworth because he was a hatter; though Mr. Wentworth placed himself no where but in the class of useful citizens and honest men. In these errors of society children early imitate their parents; and thus, although the sons of both gentlemen had for many years been school-mates they had never been intimate play-mates. When thrown together they were always civil to each other, for Pierce had no feeling like that instilled into Harry's bosom, and Harry was too good-natured and social to treat any one with rudeness. On the present passage they had been much thrown together and dependent on each other for amusements to pass the time; and this dependence on Harry's side had thawed much of his pride of caste. He could not, however, altogether forget that while he was to be a merchant's clerk in Boston, Pierce was to learn a trade. The reflection did not influence his conduct materially until this morning when their near approach to their port of destination began to throw Harry back upon his pride of caste, for he began very weakly to reflect that it would not become him to keep up the acquaintance of a mechanic's apprentice in Boston, and that if he did not wish to be mortified by such a companion he ought to begin to show Pierce that he did not intend their intimacy should last longer than the circumatances which brought them together. He, therefore, after dressing himself up in his short waisted olive with the velvet collar and pantaloons to match, his sky blue vest, and azure cravat, began to look juvenile dignity, to love his own society or covet that of the smart collegian. Pierce discovered and well understood the cause of his school-fellow's change of manuer, and while he smiled inwardly he felt his own moral superiority. Therefore it was, that, when they approached the city, Harry preferred asking information from Pason Pearl to deriving it from a source which might invade his personal dignity, or give encouragement to Pierce for further intimacy. This feeling was the result of erroneous education and belonged rather to his head than his heart, which was kindly disposed to all around him; he was rather the victim than the subject of contempt which it naturally might create in the minds of others. While he withdrew from Pierce's companionship he would have leaped into the water to save his life or have done him any tree and generous service of what he stood in need. But to take his arm and walk in the streets of Boston with him, he had not moral courage to do it. As the sloop came up towards the town, the vast tiers of shipping lining the wharves; the extensive massive blocks that stretched along them; the height and extent of the ranges of stores; the crowded and bustling piers; the huge ships of war at anchor in the stieam, and the water peopled with boats clustering in all directions, filled their minds with wonder and novel pleasure; while, as they came nearer, the cries and mingled voices of men, the roar of wheels upon the paved streets, and the confused noises of a great sea-port, struck them with awe. It seemed a new world upon which they had just entered—a new planet at which they had arrived; and, certainly, the contrast between the quiet, pleasant river-town they had left three days before, and the scene around them, could scarce be greater if they had landed in the moon instead of in Boston Bay. Now drew near the scenes and moments of greatest excitement. The sloop wound her way with lessening sail to the end of Long wharf and passing its head steered under her jib, only, between the constantly moving craft, up the dock and came close in to an angle of a jutting pier, which, from its shape is called the T. When within a few yards of the wharf the jib was hauled down, a line was thrown ashore by the long arm of Seth Pinkham and fastened to a ring by an idler on the pier, and in a few minutes the sloop Aurora was warped up to her station among the Kennebec packets. So impatient had Henry been to get ashore that it was with difficulty he could restrain himself from leaping on board more than one vessel lying at the wharves which the sloop grazed ere she reached her pier. The preparations for going on shore had all been previously made, and there was now but little delay as the most impatient could wish.. `I suppose you will stop a few days in the city, Mr. Wentworth, and so we shall meet, I dare say,' said Mr. Harefoot, with a certain high air he always puts on with his best coat, and wore especially when in Boston; and the portly merchant buttoned another button of his coat, settled his hat and put his foot cautiously on the plank to leave the vessel. `Yes I daresay,' said the hatter, dryly. `Well, good day, sir,' added the merchant, `good morning, Captain! I will see you to-morrow at Dana's store, and tell you what freight I shall want you to take. Let Pearl take Henry's trunk and mine up to Merriam a Coffee House. Come Henry.' Harry needed no urging. He lingered a moment to shake hands with the skipper, nod at Pearl, and give him ninepence, smile and how at Pierce and his sister, and the next moment he was by his father's side, his head perfectly bewildered and overrun with the novelty of all he saw; and the idea that he was to make Boston his residence filled his bosom with a sortof wild ecstacy, under the impulse of which he went almost leaping and bounding up the broken plank side-walk that was then placed in front of the stores on Long wharf. To the wharf itself he thought there would never be an end. Atlength they got to its termination, rather its beginning at the foot of State street. Here the beauty and imposing character of the edifices filled our hero with amazement. Turning into Kilby street, they at last reached the Coffee House on the corner of Milk street, a hotel I in that day much resorted to by merchants from `Down East.' Mr. Harefoot, who with parental solicitude had in vain insisted that Harry should take hold of his hand in coming through the streets, lest he should get lost, entered the hotel leading him by the arm. Seeing the host in the hall he cleared his throat and putting on his best Boston air, said in his usually pompous and now hillarious tone, `Ah, Merriam, how do you do? how do-do?' and going up to the portly landlord, the convexities of their respective abdomens just came in contact as they shook hands, like two huge demijohns placed together. `Here's my son, sir! My second son! Speak to him, Henry! This is Mr. Merriam the landlord! I have brought him up to put him in a store in Washington street! Do you know of any vacancies. `Plenty, plenty,' answered Boniface, with a good natured look; `well I'm glad to see you. Come in! Here Mr. Laugley give Major Harefoot a room with two beds in it.' `No—no—Henry can sleep with me,' said the economical merchant, hoping the charge would thereby be less; when the landlord guessing his object, said, `Beds plenty—charge no more! Give 'em No. forty three. Any baggage, Mr. Harefoot?' `It will be here soon, a valise and Harry's trunk,' answered the portly merchant wining the sweat of his long walk from his face and calling for a glass of cider. Before dinner, Pearl had safely delivered his baggage and received a four-pence ha penny therefore from Mr. Harefoot who had searched in vain for a five cent piece to give him and so save the one and a quarter cents. Harry blushed at his father's poor remuneration and gave him a nine-peace out of his three dollars and a quarter, the only pocket money he had; for this extravagance his father gave him a serious lecture, which was broken off only by the dinner bell; and as Mr. Harefoot loved to eat as well as to give his children advice, he bade Henry follow him down to the dining room. In the hall they met a Boston merchant, an extensive apple speculator who lodged in bachelor rooms at the `Exchange Coffee House.' He called to see Mr. Harefoot, who exported a great many apples from Kennebec every year, to enter upon the preliminaries for a cargo, and insisted on himself and his son dining with him at two o'clock at his hotel. Mr. Wentworth entworth and his son and daughter went to a private boarding house in Brattle street, Pierce carrying his own trunk and Isabel and her father walking before arm in arm. Now having placed our characters on the theatre of action we will leave them for another chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. Harry dines at the Exchange—Evinces his fondness for soup—A new mode of carving pigeons or a waiter not a waiter—Our hero despairs of knowing how to dine—Watches his neighbors— Finds out the use of his Champaigne glass and proves himself a judge of good cider—A fraternal lecture—A walk about Boston—The Wentworth's and a father's advice to a son—The milliner and her apprentice—The housewright and his shop—Pierce's master—Harry takes tea out —His father's mode of getting him a place, which they prepare to put into execution. The size of the hall, at the Exchange which was then the `Tremont of the city; the great length of the table; the numerous dishes with which it was filled; the number of the guests and the noise and confusion caused by the removing of plates, the rattling of knives, and running to and fro of the attendants, filled Harry Harefoot's mind with surprise. He took a seat beside his father, who from the lowness of his birth and of his condition had been unused to the usages of good society, until he had made money himself, and forced himself into it, and was proportionable solicitous of being thought perfectly well-bred and au fait in all matters appertaining to the table. Conscious of the meagre style of his own living at home he knew that Harry had had few opportunities of learning from experience how to behave; and as he would have been extremely mortified at any blunder he might make as reflecting upon himself he undertook to watch him and give him an occasional hint much to the annoyance of the youth, who ignorant of the ordeal he had to pass through, felt that his common sense would be a sufficient guide to keep him from exposing himself. `Stop Henry,' said the anxious merchant as our hero handed his plate a second time for soup, innocently supposing he was to make his dinner of it, being unaccustomed to more than one dish at home; `stop my son,' whispered the astounded parent, with a crimsoned forehead and pinching him in the side, `never ask twice for soup. It is vulgar and folks will think you have never had any bringing up.' Harry put down his soup-plate in consternation, for he was keenly sensitive. Seeing opposite to him a potted pigeon, he mustered courage to stick his fork into it, and was about to transfer it to his emptied soup-plate, from the habit of never being allowed to change his plate at his father's table, when the confused parent caught his hand and gently disengaged it leaving the fork stuck in the pigeon. `Here, waiter,' said the mortified Mr. Harefoot looking both red and blue, `take this soup-plate away! There's your clean plate turned upside down under it,' he growled. `Now if you want a piece of pigeon don't take a whole one, but call a waiter to carve it.' `Yes sir,' said Harry, blushing at the idea of having done any thing to render himself ridiculous, and in so new a position, perfectly at a loss how to act. He was resolved however to have a piece of the potted pigeon, and his father being at this moment asked by his neighbor the speculator, the price of winter apples per barrel, he obediently followed his directions, and seeing standing near him the same respectable looking man who had taken away his soup-plate he caught his eye and said, `Sir, if you please, will you bring me a waiter.' `I am one, sir,' answered the attendant bowing civilly. Harry stared. His father kept no waiters—he had never been waited upon at table in his life. He had no idea of any waiter but a japanned one. He knew that rich persons were waited on, but he thought they who did the service were called `helps,' or `hired' men. He therefore looked a moment in the face of the servant before replying and then repeated his request. `Oh, ah! yes,' replied the man and flying off returned with a little japanned salver. Harry received it with becoming thanks for his politeness, and placing it beside him removed the potted pidgeon from the dish to the little waiter and deliberately began to carve it upon it. While performing this process with great carnestness his father, having ended his conversation with his neighbor the apple speculater, turned to look after his son. When he was fully assured, after a moment's astonished inspection of his labors of what he was so deliberately engaged in, he felt as if in his confusion he should sink beneath the table, where he felt like pitching Harry. Looking round and seeing others were too busy with their own food to remark what he was doing be became very greatly relieved. Without speaking a word for he was too horror-struck to articulate, but looking daggers at poor Harry, who innocently thought he was following the Boston fashion of carving birds, he caught up the waiter, which bore numerous marks of the knife's edge, upset from it the unfortunate pigeon into Harry's plate and tossed the unoffending japan under the table. `You have lost your wits,' he said sharply. `Coming to Boston has made you a born fool.' `If I'm a born fool it was before I saw Boston, father,' said Harry with shame and vexation, `you told me to call a waiter to carve the pigeon, and I did so.' `What do you call that standing behind the gentleman's chair?' indignantly asked the offended merchant. `A man, sir—an Irishman.' `Heaven save your brains! I wish I had put you to old Yellowly the smith at Hallowell hook, for you have no more brains than would shoe a horse. He is a waiter, sir. I meant a man net a varnished tray. Now see if you can eat your dinner without making another blunder. You make me ashamed of you. They will think we are all ignoramuses down in Kennebec, and that your family is not genteel.' The solicitous merchant having seen that his perplexed, embarrassed and very much mortified son was helped to vegetables, again turned his attention to his neighbor who had listened, without seeming to hear, with a half smile to this little by-scene between father and son. Harry finished his pigeon in silence without lifting his eyes from the table-cloth. When he laid down his knife and fork a waiter snatched his plate away, replaced it by another and inquited his wants. `I will take some fish, if you please,' he said, his eye resting upon a well buttered halibut not far off. `Never take fish after meat, Henry, if you wish to be genteel,' said the merchant aside. `Will you never learn?' Puzzled and mortified he knew not how to act and though the pigeon had not satisfied his appetite he resolved to have nothing else, but sit and see how others did. Next to him sat a young gentleman very fashionably attired, wearing long whiskers and having his hair perfumed, who had been all the while so closely engaged with his dinner that he paid no attention to our hero. Harry resolved to watch him and take him for his pattern. But here his ambition led him into still deeper difficulties. It so happened that this young gentleman at the close of the dinner had placed before him a small bottle of Champaigne, part of which he poured out and drank in a very tall oddly shaped glass; one precisely like which was turned upside down by his own plate, and the use of which until now had completely puzzled Harry. A new light broke in upon him; nervous and anxious from his previous sins against etiquette, and fearing he should be wanting in some important duty of the table with these glasses, the use of which he had now discovered, pointed out, he turned up his glass, reached forth his hand and imitating the air nonchalant of his neighbor in doing the same thing, quietly took up the bottle and filled it with the sparkling wine. He then held it to the light a moment to watch its ascending fleet of bubblets and drank it off, complacently remarking to the confounded young gentleman, as he put down the glass, `This is very fine cider, sir.' `Yes, very,' dryly answered the young gentleman his frown of surprise exchanged for a smile of such peculiar significance that Harry, who was not a fool, though ignorant enough of life, immediately felt conscious of having been guilty of come impropriety. The very idea made him perspire and his knees tremble. His father happened to turn round just as, after emptying his glass, he had set it down upon the cloth. He stared wildly with his great round blue eyes, cast a glance at the young gentleman with the whiskers, and his mind misgave him. `Harry,' he whispered, `did that gentleman ask you to take a glass of wine with him?' `No, sir.' `Do you know him?' `No, sir.' `Do you know what you have been guilty of, you, you—I don't know what to call you?' demanded the merchant strenly. Harry did not know; and looked to his incensed parent for information, his soul appalled in anticipation of some fearful developement, `No sir, I do not,' he at length faintly answered. `Then I will tell you, sir. That bottle of wine belongs to that gentleman—his private property— is individual possession—and not as you have ignorantly supposed common to the whole table.— You have been guilty of a great breach of ill manners, and I am half a mind to take you back to Kennebec and put you to the plough. Sir, my son has not been used to a public table, I hope you will excuse him. He has been accustomed to take wine only at our table, where, as you know, the wine is in common and not as at hotels. I really hope you will excuse him.' `Certainly, sir,' said the young gentleman bowing at the father and son, the former feeling his cheek burn at the consciousness of having lied about Harry's drinking wine at home; but Mr. Harefoot was one of those weak men who to save their pride from being wounded will stain their soul with falsehood. The rest of the dinner passed off with but one or two more trifling gaucheries on the part of our hero, who mistook the finger glasses with the slice of lemon floating in them for lemonade and being thirsty began to drink to the perfect consternation of his father and the infinite amusement of the young gentleman with the half bottle of Champaigne; and was also caught by his watchful sire in the commission of a still greater offence, that of eating his custard pudding with a knife, on the plea that he could not eat it with the split spoon, as he very happily denominated the silver fork which the waiter laid by his plate. Dinner over, the mortified and angry Mr. Harefoot sternly bade Henry follow him to the hotel and to his chamber, where seating himself on the edge of the bed, and making Harry stand before him, he delivered him a half hour's lecture upon his gross misdemeanors, and having thoroughly emptied himself of his indignation, he kept him another half hour giving him advice how to conduct himself in future. Henry was extremely sensitive and he endured not a little mental torture at the ignorance which he betrayed; but he felt on reflection that it had been no fault of his own; that everything at the table d'hote was opposed to all his former experience; and consoling himself with the reflection that such mistakes might happen to any one older than himself on first arriving in a city from the country, he took up his hat to follow his father out to see the city. With the digestion of his dinner and the discharge of his displeasure in the advice he had bestowed, the merchant was again in good humor, and proposed to show his son `the lions,' postponing till the next day the business of seeking a situation in a store for him. `Come, Harry, I hope you will recollect my advice, for everything in Boston depends on appearing well. Now we will visit the State House and Museum, for I want you to see these things now, before you get a place, so you wont care to be running after em when you should be minding your business. When you get into a store you must forget that you are a boy and let work take place of play. There's some lint on your collar and a spec o' dirt on your trowsers! Keep neat, my son, for appearance is everything in such a place as Boston. Brush your hair a little!— There you look nice, now. Do you see any dirt on my back?' Harry looked over the capacious dorsal of his tidy father but seeing nothing that looked like dirt he signified as much to him; whereupon the portly merchant putting on his hat after smoothing it it by one or two turns across his cuff, left No. 43, followed by our hero, who, after the smarting recollection of his awkward mistakes, felt vexed with himself, with Boston, with his father, and impatient to get at once into a store to be freed from his annoying supervision at the next meal. Before going to the Museum, Mr. Harefoot had some business in Broad street with a wholesale grocer of whom he purchased his articles in that line for retailing down east. Absolutely refusing to take his careful parent's hand which he insisted with great warmth lest he should get hurt or stray, Harry kept by his side as well as he could for falling back every few rods to gaze at some new object. He wondered at the long shears-like drays with three horses extended a tandem; an ingenious device peculiar to Boston dray men for detaining passengers at street crossings, which they are very successful in doing especially when four or five followed each other in succession as is their custom, not leaving space for a pig to cross between the tail of one and the leading horse of the other; he marvelled at the crowded sidewalks which also for some distance were covered compectly with hogsheads doubtless to preserve the bricks, and tiers of hogsheads Bostonians all well know who have been about the wharve streets, make very airy promenades, and keep passengers out of the mud. At length they reached the counting room to which they were destined and our hero was formally introduced to the Boston merchant, who, with a pen stuck behind his ear, was looking over an invoice of West India rums when they entered. `So you are going to put your son in a store,' said Mr. Osborne, blandly, after the two merchants had talked together on business; `How do you think you shall like Boston, Henry?' he asked smiling pleasantly; and without waiting for an answer he added, `You must come and take tea with me, Mr. Harefoot, and bring your son, and let him get acquainted with my boys. Mr. Harefoot promised, and our hero felt delighted at the idea of knowing a Boston boy. His father having inquired of Mr. Osborne if he knew of any person in want of a `clerk,' and being told in the negative, asked and obtained permission to refer to him if a stranger should wish to take Henry. From this counting room and with a very favorable impression of Mr. Osborne, whom he felt he should like to keep with, our hero took his way up State street with his father, who pointed out to him the uses of the principal edifices there. `Here, my son,' he said, after they had got past the corner of Kilby street, throwing open the wings of his coat, thrusting his left thumb into the arm hole of his buff Valencia vest and looking very patriotic, while his right arm made a sweep around him, here, my son, we stand on a spot ever memorable to an American citizen and I as a soldier (Mr. Harefoot was a major in the Kennebee militia) cannot pass it by in justice to myself or my country without speaking! Here the British troops first fired upon the Boston citizens, and in that gutter, there at our feet, flowed the crimsoned blood of the glorious martyrs to eternal liberty, while these very pavin stones cried out, and General Washington himself armed with the sword of justice answered their cry and avenged their blood!' `Was it the paving stones that bled, sir?' asked Harry mischievously, but with a look of innocence. `No, my son—no,' answered Mr. Harefoot blushing, conscious of his blunder; `I meant the blood of the citizens you foolish boy. That building standing directly at the top of the street, spliting the end of it like a fork, is the old State House —the cradle of liberty.' `I thought Fanueil Hall was the cradle of liberty, sir,' Harry ventured to suggest. `Oh, ah, yes, so you are right my son. I am glad to see you have profited by the thirteen year's constant education you have enjoyed.— Fannel Hall is the cradle of liberty and this old State House is where it was hatched when the British soldiers fired here before it on the town's people. This is Washington street, Harry, the greatest street, people say, in any city in America, though it is rather narrow and not very strait; but this it makes up in length. Here are all the English good-stores, the jewellers, the fancy shops and almost every thing you can think of We'll walk up and down it to-morrow as I intend to get you a place in some English good-store in it, as you would rather keep such a store than in a grocery like Mr Oshorne's. This is Court street and in these buildings all the lawyers, and lots of `em there are in Boston, keep their offices.' At length our hero reached the Museum where he remained two hours very much entertained with his visit. Thence he went to the State House and ascended to the lantern, the view from which repaid him for the toil of the ascent. After adding his own name to the thousands carved on the wainscoating and let his glance linger once more over the unparalleled landscape, of city, village, island, sea and illimitable extent of champaign country inland, he descended with a larger heart and wider scope of mental power, and in the possession of new avenues of thought and intellectual enjoyment. Like one of those `invisible pictures' which present no other outline or coloring to the eye until exposed a while to the full beams of the light, when a rich and bold landscape appears in all its fair tints and proportions, is the heart of youth, which is painted by the hand of its Creator with pictures of all that is bright and beautiful in his varied empire; and to be brought out it must be brought to the light of nature and feel its warm and glowing influence! Henry felt a thousand pictures of beauty had been brought out upon his heart by the reflection of scenes which seemed to him to embrace all the varieties of earth's wide domain; ocean, isle, vale and mountain, lakelet and woodland. The day was spent in rambling over the city, and as our hero was very observing of every thing he once saw, and possessed largely developed the organ of `locality,' he became so familiar in this walk with the intricacies of the city as to feel a confidence in himself that he could traverse it again in all directions without losing himself. In the course of their walk they had met with Mr. Wentworth and Pierce and his sister, who accouted them with cordiality but, were recognized only by a dignified bow by Major Harefoot and a hur ried, half-nod by Harry; for he was afraid somebody might see him speak and he did not wish any one toknow he was acquainted with a mechanic's family. We are sorry to have to record such a weakness of so sensible a young man as our hero, but as our object is, like that of the physician, to heal, we must probe and expose the disease. Harry's blunders at table were light matters, and are not mentioned to his disparagement, as they were by no means very important after all; but a moral error, one that had its origin in the head and extends its roots down towards the heart, this is indeed an evil that is not lightly to be held. `I fear, Mr. Harefoot's son will be spoiled by living in Boston,' said Mr. Wentworth to Pierce after they had passed so coldly; `he already assumes conduct that I should be very sorry to see you imitate. But I trust to your good sense and healthy moral education to keep you from error of heart or conduct; regard, my son, reputation above every thing else. Think not of your appearance as I tear Henry Harefoot too much does, but think how you shall gain the esteem of those around you. Cultivate kindness of heart, forbearance and gentleness of demeanor. Keep your conscience unsoiled, for it is the golden pendulum of the heart. Bear in mind, my dear son, as you are to make this your home and here cast your fortunes, perhaps for life, that in a large city where men only meet each other occasionally and then but for a few moments on business; that confidence depends on the known integrity, reputation and general character which each knows the other to possess; and all intercourse has this knowledge for its basis. Dress in a city is nothing looked to, for there are as many fashions and modes as there are professions and pursuits. But untarnished chcracter is every thing. In a village men know each other intimately, the good and bad sides of each other's characters and while virtue on one hand condemns, charity on the other pleads. But in a place like Boston, where such intimacy cannot exist, men have opportunity of knowing only one side of a man's character, it is either the good or the bad and so they judge him. In a village one wrong act in a man may be covered by a hundred well known good qualities; in a c ty that one act is the man! men judge him by what he is to them at the moment, not by what, if they had time to know him better, he is in his known intercourse with his neighbors. Therefore be careful from this day to do nothing here while a boy that you are not willing when you come to do business with men should be the test of your character; for men may have heard only of that one folly and not seeing you for years naturally judge of your whole life by it. The freedom of the long intercourse of a village would give opportunity to correct impressions—but the distance preserved between men in a city, never.' While Mr. Wentworth was giving this sensible advice to Pierce, who listened with great attention, he came to a shop near the corner of Summer street, over the door of which was a sign, on which was printed in gilt letters—`Mrs. Prescott, Milliner and Mantua-Maker.' `This is the place, Isabel,' he said to the little Kennebec maiden, whose heart fluttered like a bird's at the anticipation of so soon being in the presence of her mistress. Mr. Wentworth was received with great kindness by the lady, a good looking person of forty in a black silk and muslin cap, with a pair of scissors hanging to her apron strings. She shook hands with Pierce and her new apprentice, and complimented the father upon such fine children. It was soon decided that Isabel's trunk should be sent there the same evening, and that she should now remain and enter to-morrow upon her new duties. Isabel bade her father and brother good bye with tearful eyes, the former of whom promised to come and see her in the morning, and Pierce that he would call by every day. Mrs. Prescott was a kind, good person, and asking Isabel into a back parlor, entered into a conversation with her about Kennebeck, and what she had seen in Boston, so that she soon became reconciled to her situation. There were in the room three apprentices; one of them, who was a very plain girl, on seeing her, put up her lip at her and secretly turned her head against the pretty stranger; another, a fine looking creature about her own age, with a spirited head, cast at the rustic beauty a scornful glance from a pair of very fine dark eyes; while the other, a mild, fair-haired, blue-eyed girl, smiled kindly upon her and offerce her the rocking-chair in which she was seated. Isabel had quickly detected all these several impressions her appearance made upon them, and her heart was drawn and repelled just as each had given the original impulse. After leaving the milliner's, Mr. Wentworth walked up Washington street with Peirce by his side, both silent and sad; the former at the reflection that he had left his child to struggle from that hour with the rude current of the world; the latter partly with the separation from his sister, and partly at the prospect of soon parting also with his father. To Mr. Wentworth, himself, it was a painful trial to remove his two children from the shelter of his paternal arms, alone in a strange city, in danger from innumerable temptations, and at an age when most they needed the guiding hand and warning voice of a parent. But custom made him willing, and necessity rendered it expedient that this separation should take place. It was the law of large families in New England, and he had to obey it. The habit of contemplating such a separation when his children should be of sufficient age, and daily preparing for it, had rendered both parents and children less sensible to the pain of such a parting; besides there was a prospect of an annual meeting, which should knot closer the ties which stern necessity had for a time loosened. After a few minutes walk they turned down Essex street, and came to an alley, at the entrance of which, projecting from a two-story, unpainted wooden building, was a sign showing the passer-by that `Benjamin Libby, Housewright and Carpenter,' kept his shop in the rear, to which a hand with an open finger on the sign pointed. `This is the place,' said Mr. Wentworth; and going down the narrow alley, which was lumbered with boards and strewn with fresh shavings, they came to an extensive carpenter's shop, in which several journeymen and apprentices were at work. At a high, narrow pine desk, by a window near the wide door, stood a large-framed man with an intelligent benevolent countenance, with silver spectacles on his nose, adding up a row of figures on a slate. Peirce eyed him as he stood there in his shirt sleeyes, with a shaving ringlet lodged over his right ear and a rag wound about a wounded thumb, to see what he had to expect from his new master, for such he instinctively knew him to be. The observation of a youth at such a time is usually very shrewd and accurate, and the impression after a jealous serutiny of the whole man was decidedly favorable; and with less tumultuous throbbing of the heart, he approached him a step or two behind his father.— The meeting between the two gentlemen was cordial and friendly. `So this is your son Peirce?' said the old housewright, shoving his glasses to the top of his high massive forehead, and looking at him with a sort of inspecting glance. `Well, he is a large, well built youth for seventeen, and if he makes as honest a man a good a citizen as his father, I shall hope no more for him. Have you a fancy for house-building? though I dare say you have made houses out of chips many a time. Has he genius for handling carpenter's tools, Mr. Wentworth?' `Yes; and to be a carpenter is his own choice. He made a set of baby house furniture last year for a little daughter of Judge Boardman that was as beautifully finished as that in the Judge's parlor.' `Ah! then he has the right sort of talent. Do you wish to indent him till he is of age?' `Yes; for this will convey to you what I wish to transfer, the authority of a parent over him. The habit, now becoming so common, of not indenting boys is the cause of so much profligacy in the class of apprentices. It is true, that our laws do not, like the English laws, ordain that a youth shall serve seven years by indenture before he can himself follow the trade he has learned; yet it is necessary for apprentices, as well as for their better sequaintance of a trade, that they should be indented, though four or five years is long enough for an intelligent boy to acquire any trade. I do not like the plan of taking boys away from school at the tender age at which many parents remove them, often from a sinful economy in board and schooling. Let boys be kept at school till sixteen, and they will be better educated; let them be kept till that age beneath the paternal eye, and they will be better behaved, than if so early turned upon the world, moulds of wax, as some wise man has termed the young heart, ready to receive every evil impression from the example of others.' To these remarks the housewright assented, and some further conversation followed, during which Peirce was walking through the shop, observing the countenances of the men and boys he was for the future to associate with, and watching at their several occupations. It was decided that the indentures should be drawn up and signed the next day, and that the new apprentice was to come to the shop in the morning and enter upon his career. After leaving the shop with his new master, Peirce expressed himself much pleased. It being now near the close of the afternoon, they returned to their boarding-house to tea, at which, as well as at dinner, he fell into no mortifying blunders; because the unostentatious habits and good sense of the father had led him to select a house in the humble style of his own home. Harry and his father returned to their `coffeehouse'—the fashionable designation then of first class hotels, but now applied only to ordinary eating-houses—and having rested themselves, went to Mr. Osborne's house, in Milk street, to tea.— Harry's ideas of the respectability of the family were increased, from the size of the house and the rich long curtains he saw at the drawing-room windows. Tea passed off very well, and Harry recovered his self-respect; though he felt a little annoyed at discovering that the young Osbornes were dressed in much better taste than himself, and evidently, he thought, felt themselves superior to himself coming from a down east town.— There was, too, an air of case and a certain self-possessed address about them to which he felt he was a stranger, and which he resolved to make the effort to acquire. His father talked about liquors and groceries, serewed hay and corn, with Mr. Osborne, leaving him to their care, though occasionally watching his conduct with nervous solicitude. After passing the evening very pleasantly, Harry went home with his father impressed with the superiority of education, of address, of conversational powers, and in pronunciation and accuracy of language of the two sons of Mr. Osborne; and he was a little mortified to find that although in Augusta he was called clever and intelligent, had written verses in albums and had been in love, and considered himself quite a bean in dress and manners, that, compared with his newly-made Boston friends, he was quite rustic. Harry had ambition, but it was ill-directed. It was the ambition to appear, and not to be. He was annoyed more at the superior cut of Frederic Osborne's coat and pants, and at the fashion and beauty of his hair, than at his superior intelligence; envied his address and polite exterior rather than the grace and kindness of his heart. And his mind at this time received the seeds of vanity and expense, nourished by a weak ambition, which promised to bring forth bitter fruits. The next morning Pierce went cheerfully to Mr. Libby's, calling on his way upon Isabel, whom he found seated industriously at work by a window that opened upon a little green yard, Mr. Libby commended him for his prompt appearance, and placing him under his head journeymen, left him to begin the first rudiments of his trade—take the first step upwards tewards usefulness, wealth and respectability, or descend, through idleness, dissipation and infamy to an ignominious end. The same day Mr. Wentworth signed the indentures of his son, and taking leave of him and Isabel, returned the next day in a Hallowell sloop for his home. The ensuing morning the aristocratic Kennebec merchant, having breakfasted, went into the reading room to look over the papers for an advertisement for a clerk in a dry goods' store; he set Harry at the same work, and after a thorough scanning of the columns in vain, the merchant resolved to take a course that would insure success, if there was a dry goods' clerk wanted in Boston. Aware that all the stores of this kind were in Washington and Hanover streets, he determined to begin at Cornhill, (omitting Hanover street, in which were the less stylish shops,) and go up one side and and return by the other inquiring at each store that had `a respectable look,' Harry insisting that he would keep only in such an one; and the higher the store in his estimation the more genteel. An expedient so sensible as this was worthy the head of the sagacious major. This proposal giving Harry an opportunity of selection was, after a slight struggle with his sensitiveness at being taken round in this way by his father, like a bale of merchandize or a sale-pig, assented to by him; and with this intent the father and son sallied forth from the coffee-house, and took their way towards No. 1, Cornhill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. A tour among the dry goods stores—the polite dealer—the shop-keeper in spectacles—mistake father for son—Harry's resolution—Our Hero gets a place—Paternal advice—Our hero enters upon his duties—Mr. Jeremiah Martin the first clerk—The bundle—Harry receives a chapter of advice from his master—His discovery that clerking is not so “genteel” as he thought— His emotion—His boarding house—Scene the next morning—Our hero shows his spirit and does great credit to Kennebec The first store to which our hero and his father came was a dashing establishment, the outside coming quite up to their ideas of what was genteel. Mr. Harefoot therefore resolved to make application there, and after hemming and clearing his throat and buttoning his coat a button higher, he walked in followed by Harry. One of the brisk clerk's after eyeing him a moment and taking especial notice of his short waisted olive, winked at his fellow, and putting his thumb against his nose made sundry mysterious signs with his four digitals and Harry distinctly heard him whisper “verdant.” He well knew what this meant, and resolved in his heart to pay him for his insolence at some future day.— Always thinking about appearances, he saw to his mortification that his clothes were not so fashionable as those of the young clerks; and that if, which was his ambition, he wished to be thought a city youth, he must soon have others made. Mr. Harefoot having been shown the proprietor, approached him where he stood at a desk writing. “Are you in want of a boy here, sir?” asked Mr. Harefoot in a respectiful tone. The dapper shopkeeper put down his pen, stared at the speaker a minute with an abstracted air, and then glanced over his shoulder at the boy, whose cheek was burning with shame and anger at being designated “a boy.” He looked therefore very sulky and his sensitiveness shrinking from a scrutiny like that the shopkeeper intended he turned his face away. “ 'As he ivir bein in a storr?” asked the dealer in dry goods, passing his jewelled fingers through his perfumed looks. “No, I have just taken him from school. My name is Harefoot from Augusta. I am a merchant there, sir, and have dealings in Boston.— I can refer you to Dana &amp; Co., Osborne, Berriam and Wrigham, and almost any body,” added the Kennebec merchant with a nonchalant air of importance. “I 'ave no doubt wativir your recommendashions ar' vera good, saar,” drawled out the shop keeper, “but I am very sorry to say, saar, that I shall be under the painful necessity of declining your very flattering preference with re ference to your son. He seems a very likely young youth and I 'ope you will find others liss provided for than I appear to be jist at this moment.” Thus speaking the dealer bowed very politely to Mr. Harefoot, who returned the bow with becoming dignity, and followed by our hero left the store. “Father,” said Harry as soon as he got on the outside, “I wish you would not call me a boy again. I am ashamed of this way of hunting a place, and I mean soundly to thrash that chap with the curly hair the first time I meet him.” On Mr. Harefoot's promising not to term him a boy again Harry consented to proceed, but resolved to stand outside the doors while his father put the question. In this manner they called at nearly twenty places without success. “Seems to me, Harry,” said the merchant as he came out of one, “that nobody wants clerks. This man says he could get twenty a day if he wanted them and took his last one out of pity.— If Boston is so overrun with clerks wanting places, you have come to a bad market I fear.— Why don't their parents make mechanics of them,” applying to others a rule which he would not himself follow; “I saw several in these stores that looked as if they would make better farmers and blacksmiths than clerks I fear I shall hardly get you a place in one of the first rate stores; let us try in here; this looks respectable though not so dashy as some, and a respectable looking man with spectacles is behind the counter.” “This is too low, father. See they sell no fine goods and the man who keeps it is not a gentleman by his dress. It's a third rate store,” interposed Harry. “Nevertheless I may as well try, for you would be ashamed as well as I to go back home after coming up to Boston to get a place in a store Try an inferior place first and meanwhile look out for a better.” Thus speaking Mr. Harefoot entered a low, dark domestic goods' store, followed by Harry in no pleasant mood. “Sir,” said the well dressed Kennebec merchant bowing formally to the elderly man who was behind the counter folding up a piece of sheeting, “I have called to see if you are in want of a clerk?” The dealer finished folding up the piece of goods, and put it in its place on the shelf before he paid any attention to the question. Then turning round he brought his iron-rim'd spectacles to bear upon the corpulent person of the militia Major, who felt not a little touched at his first manifestation of indifference. After surveying him for full a minute from top to toe, he gave his head a negative shake, while he answered in a squeaking small voice and a simpering smile. “He, he, I guess you are a leetle too old, hey?” The Merchant was thunder struck! he was speechless with indignant astonishment! A Major in the Kennebec Militia to be taken for a clerk seeking a place!—a Merchant—a respectable Merchant like him—a man so well dressed— to be supposed in a situation seeking employment? The thought was cutting to his vanity and pride. “No sir,” answered Mr. Harefoot proudly drawing himself up; “I came in to ask for my son here.” “Oh, ah! this lad is your son then. Well my man can you cypher?” “Sir, my son is well educated that is sufficient,” answered Mr. Harefoot with dignity.— “Do you want a clerk?” “Yes, I do, that is if you call a shop-boy a clerk which I do not, he, he! He is strong looking and could carry large bundles I see; and I sell a good deal by the piece.” At the idea of carrying bundles Henry's spirit rose and turning to his father he said aloud, “I will not keep in this store, sir?” and walked out. Mr. Harefoot was under the necessity of abruptly breaking off the negotiation with the terms of which he was as little pleased as Harry; and they passed on to another store ef a more “respectable” exterior Here the proprietor, who was a tall gentlemanly looking man with a high bold forehead, a pleasant face and dressed in an olive brown frock replied in the affirmative to Mr. Harefoot's stereotyped inquiry, much to his own and Harry's gratification; for everything in and about the store wore an air indicative of the “respectability” of the proprietor's standing; while a long counter thronged with genteel customers and strewn deep with tumbled goods wore proofs of a thriving business. Harry was formally presented to Mr. Cushing, the proprietor, who taking him kindly by the hand welcomed him to Boston, addressing him several questions calculated to fathom his capacity, and then said he should be very happy to receive him on trial, being satisfied with the reference Mr Harefoot offered of his own respectability. It was decided that Harry should come the next morning, be boarded at the expense of his employer and receive the first year two suits of clothes. The two gentlemen then formally shook hands and separated; our hero leaving the store with its half dozen staring clerks in company with his father. “Now my son,” said he as they walked along the street, “you ought to be very thankful that you have got a situation and one in so respectable a store. I have heard of Mr. Cushing and know him to be in good society here. The conditions he proposes are better than I expected— it will make you nearly independent of me.— Two suits of clothes, one for summer and one for winter, will be sufficient for you with proper care.” “But I shall have no money, sir.” “Money? You will want no money! Haven't I taken you to the Museum, and you wont wish to go there again; and as for other uses for money you will have none. Now as I shall be very busy the rest of the day on the wharf, I will give you a little advice, Henry. In the first place do all in your power to please Mr Cushing, for you will be dependent on him; be obliging and civil to the other clerks, but let none of them impose on you becaase you are from a country town; for your father let them know, my son, is a Merchant, a Major, and might have been a candidate for the legislature! Keep always well dressed, for that is a mark of respectability. The first wants of man in a state of nature are food, shelter and clothing, and so far as he is deficient in these be approaches the savage state. He who lives in the handsomest house, keeps the best table and dresses the best is the farthest removed from this rude condition—is civililized, or, in other words has attained to be a true and perfect gentleman. Dress, in a place like Boston, is the touchstone! Do you suppose Mr. Cushing would have treated me so politely and engaged you if I had gone to him in my old clothes? not that I am not as much a gentleman in them as in these,' he added, instantly retrieving his words. `Next to dress is behaviour. Study politeness. A bow costs nothing, and a smile is full as cheap. Flatter men if you wish to use them, and learn to keep your own secrets while you get at those of others. As every thing in a large city depends on outside appearances for people haven't time to study the inside, you must appear every thing you find you cannot be. This, I have found by my own experience answers very well for the world. By all means preserve, my son, a good moral character for as your mother and I have always taught yon, you are accountable to God for the way you keep your heart; but with regard to men, it is not of so much importance if you look to be rich; for there is little morality in a business way. An untruth told in the way of trade is no falsehood and is often necessary. Do not therefore, if Mr. Cushing desires it, hesitate at this; but never, my son, tell a lie when there is nothing to be gained by it; for this is both folly and sin. Always at end church and never be out of nights nor go to the theatre, unless some one makes you a present of a ticket for it is expensive. I wont forbid your going altogether, for theatres are fashionable, and it is genteel to attend them, and I want to see you a gentleman. Never be tempted to borrow money from the till, not a copper, nor appropriate any thing in the store to your own use without leave. Write home once a month by private hand, out never send a letter or newspaper by mail, for this costs postage. It is better to trouble people if they do grumble if you can save a shilling or a quarter of a dollar. I never had a letter yet unless there was money in it that was worth a quarter of a dollar. So dont write unless you can send. Be careful to save every penny, and by and by I hope to see you a rich and prosperous man keeping your own store, hiring your own clerks, and living in as good style as any body in Boston.' Such was the character of the advice given by the worldly Mr. Harefoot to his son; being a singular mixture of craft and truth, of good and evil; the moral picture of his own life, conduct and principles. There is many a man of like principles and motives of action, doubtless, but few who have exhibited such candor in betraying their parti-colored morality. The ensuing morning our hero rose and dressed with a fluttering heart. This was the first day of his entrance into life, and of the surrender of that liberty and leisure, in which he had been indulged at home, to the will of another. To-day, too, he was to begin to be industrious—to endure confinement—to be engaged in an occupation from morning till night. Employment was new to him; and to speak the truth of our hero, he was not very partial to work. The intervals in his school hours had never found him employed save in active games, or, which he loved as well, in reading novels. Up to the time he had reached his sixteenth year he had read every novel in the village library, and was compelled to resort to history from necessity, or not read at all. The last year voyages, travels, history, poetry and biography had been his food, and at the time he is now introduced to the reader few youths possessed a wider stock of information. His memory was good and he could always use his ideas well in conversation. He was therefore, at home, held by all the town as quite a prodigy; and being rather handsome and very susceptible of female loveliness, he was quite a favorite with all the pretty misses, who used to have petty quarrels about our hero, who had half a dozen little sweethearts at a time. One of these made quite an impression on his heart, and when he parted with her just before going on board the sloop there were uttered on both sides the usual protestations of eternal love, which we have all made in our teens. Harry loved dress as a natural consequence of being a favorite of the school-girls. He therefore got to be quite a beau—for a Kennebec youth—and having got a new suit—the distinguished short-waisted olive with the velvet collar—made at `the Hook' by a little tippling tailor with a queue, named Sammy, Manny who took it out in grog and groceries at his father's store, he anticipated that his appearance in Boston would create quite a sensation. His mortification was in proportion to his expectations when he discovered that Sammy was, by the full length of his greasy queue, behind the age. This gave him more annoyance than he would have been willing to confess to his father, or to himself. United to this love for outward appearance was a love for money—not for itself—but to spend in trifles; a desire to look as well as others; to seem as genteel as others; to be thought by strangers to be some person of importance; to think himself admired by every pretty girl; and to affect the society of those above him, and despise the companionship of those beneath him; united to which, was a weak sensitiveness not touching his character but his vanity as to what people would say —a living to other people's eyes rather than to the approval of those of his own conscience! These are errors common to a large portion of our New England youths, and also to many of their parents from whom they usually, we are sorry to say, first get them. Harry was not more deeply imbued with them than many others; his chief fault was, to give it in a few words, that he took more care of his person than of his heart; thought more of seeming than being. Attired in his new suit by which the knight of the queue looked to immortalize himself in Boston. Henry sadly took leave of his father, who was to return home that day, and hastened to Mr. Cushing's, in Washington street. The hour hand of the Old South clock pointed to eight as he entered the store with a heightened color and a feeling of trepidation. The store presented a very neat and quite a different appearance from the day before; the goods were all folded and nicely placed on the shelves; the floor was swept and coolly sprinkled; the long polished counter was without a customer. Behind it were three clerks, each with a yard-stick held in his hand, talking and laughing over a morning paper; at the extremity of the store, mounted on a high stool, sat the head clerk, also reading a paper. A window behind him opened into a pleasant yard and the breeze blew refreshingly in. Harry looked round for Mr. Cushing who had not yet made his appearance, his residence being in a neat cottage, nearly two miles out on the Roxbury road. Instinctively shunning intercourse with the three clerks he hastily passed by them, receiving from them an inquiring stare, and approached the head clerk, whom he had seen the day before posting books. On hearing a footstep, Mr. Jeremiah Martin raised his eyelids, and fixing his light blue eyes upon Harry seemed to inspect him while he silently waited for him to make known his business. `Sir,' said Harry, taking off his hat and speaking with natural embarrassment, `Mr. Cushing engaged me as a clerk yesterday, to enter upon my duties this morning. `Oh, yes; I heard him say something about it,' answered Mr. Martin, laying aside the paper and drawing himself up to his full height, which was five feet half an inch, and putting on a very pompous look. `You are from Maine, I reckon.' `From Augusta.' `A pretty little village—I have been there! Do to pass through when one is in a hurry! Maine is a nice State—too rocky, and the people not quite up to the genteel mark! Boston is the place for gentlemen, and to see good society, and to know what's what! You did well to leave home. Maine will do to be born in, but—but—' `Sir, I will thank you to remember that I am from Maine,' said Harry, with spirit. `Oh, ah—no offence,' said Mr. Jeremiah Martin, in a low tone; `I am from Maine myself; I should not talk so if I wasn't you know. So you have come to live in Boston. Well, I hope you'll like it. Have you ever been in a store?' `No, sir.' `Then you will have a good deal to learn; but you look as if you might be pretty apt. Here Frank, come and take charge of—eh—what did you say your name was?' `Henry Harefoot.' `Very well. Take charge of Henry, and let him sell near you, and teach him what you can.' The person who answered to the name of Frank was a handsome young man about nineteen years of age, very neatly dressed, and had the look of an intelligent youth; and yet his face wore an expression of great-good-nature, and his manner was prepossessing. Harry took a fancy to him at once, and although his eyes lingered a moment over the country cut of Harry's coat, he shook him by the hand with cordiality, and said he was glad to have him added to their number. His words and manner put Henry at once at his case; and bowing to Mr. Jeremiah Martin, who resumed the paper, something piqued at being so properly rebuked, he followed Frank Stanwood to the spot where he had left his fellow-clerks, and was by him introduced to them. One of them was younger, the other older than Frank; and the junior, who was not quite Harry's age, immediately on learning he was a new clerk, began to caper with such manifestations of delight as greatly to excite our hero's wonder, especially as he had never before seen the freckled-face urchin. While wondering at the happiness his presence occasioned, and congratulating himself upon his good fortune in getting into such agreeable companionship, a woman came in, and asked in rather an angry tone, why the piece of linen she had purchased there the previous afternoon had not been sent to her house as she had requested. `How is this?' called out Mr Martin, sternly, `is'nt that bundle gone yet? Why didn't you take it last night after you shut up, as I told you to do Ben?' `I—I forgot it,' answered the youngster, coloring: well knowing he was too much in a hurry to get off to the circus to do it. `Go with it at once!' said the first clerk. `I'm not the last comer now,' he answered, doggedly; `let this chap take it—he's got to do my errands now.' Mr. Jeremiah Martin frowned a moment on the lad for his rude reply; but admitting its correctness, he said to Harry, whose heart was already sinking. “Here, Harry, take this bundle and follow this lady to her house, and return immediately. You must learn to be quick on errands, as you will have a great many to do in the course of the day.” Our hero's first impulse was to reply that he did not come there to be an errand boy, but to be a clerk; but recollecting that such an answer would lose him his place and bring his father's anger upon him, he concluded to put his pride in his pocket and obey. He therefore took the piece of linen from Frank Stanwood with what grace he could, and putting on his shining new beaver, followed the impatient lady out of the store; his eye catching the triumphant look on Ben Burnham's face and the secret smile of the other clerks, from whom he could not conceal his mortification. What a beginning was this for our village young gentleman! for the genteel, well-dressed youth who at home would not carry from his father's store a pound of tea without folding it daintily in his pocket handkerchief to make it appear what it was not! All the pride in the bosom of Henry was stirred and atop as he got into the street, and he walked along with a burning cheek and a feeling of shame and degredation that a different education would have kept him from experiencing; for there is no feeling so contemptible, and so indicative of erroneous bringing up under the parental roof, as this fear of being seen carrying a bundle, or anything for which we have a use, or which our duty or the nature of our business calls upon us to convey. Among other feelings that troubled Harry, was the consciousness of being too finely dressed to be carrying a bundle and so large and heavy a one, through the streets. His sense of the harmony of things showed him that he would appear better in a less shining suit; while his love of dress forbade him thinking of wearing in Boston, any other than he now wore. “If I am to go errands and carry bundles this way,” thought Harry as he walked along, avoiding every eye, and fearing he should encounter some one who knew him from Kennebec, or, what he most feared Pierce Wentworth and his sister; “if I am to be put to this low work, I had better have stayed at home and gone into father's grocery store, which I refused to do because I did not think it genteel enough! This is gentility with a vengeance! How heavy linen is! Gracious I never expected to do this! I wish the confounded little woman who trots on so trippingly, looking back every rod to see if I am coming, had it all on her back. Well, I am resolved—” What was our hero's resolve we cannot tell, as he was interrupted in his cogitations at this juncture by the arrival of the lady at the door of her house. Harry gave the bundle into her hands, rejoiced to get clear of so disgraceful an incumbrance, and the lady thanking him, entered her house. It was with a feeling both of physical and mental relief that he turned away from the house and slowly retraced his steps through Court street towards his store. A new light had broken in upon his notions of a dry goods clerk's gentility, especially the gentility of the out door part of his occupation. He had never imagined there was rotation in place, a system of promotion, in the stores to which his ambitious hopes have tended ever since his father had decided in order to lessen the expense of supporting him to put him into some employment. Now in a moment all his pleasing visions of standing, handsomely dressed, behind a mahogany counter, selling calicoes and silks to ladies, smiling, bowing, and making polite speeches, were blown to the winds. As he walked along he half-determined not to return to the store, but seek his father and beg him to permit him to go home and keep with him. But the thought of how he should be received by his town's-people, of the jeers of other youths of less aspiring minds, of the contempt of the pretty maidens, withheld him from this step. He therefore, after some reflection, concluded to put up with his disappointment as well as he could, and see if, by making an appeal to Mr. Cushing, he could not be released from being the errand-boy; for he would not now conceal the truth that he was “the boy” of the establishment. He re-entered the store with an assumed cheerful air, not wishing to give the others occasion to laugh at him in so stooping from his dignity. Mr. Cushing was in, and accosting him kindly, called him one side, and thus briefly addressed him: “Your duties, Henry, are first to rise at six in the morning, and open and sweep out, dust the goods, clean and fill the lamps, and get everything in order for the business of the day. As you are the youngest, or rather youngest in time, you will carry purchases home, go to your meals last, and shut up the store. I hope to find you active, attentive, and faithful. Your trunk you will have sent to the boarding-house, where the other clerks board, and where you will take your meals and sleep. At noon you can go home with them to learn the way. I allow no reading of newspapers, no lounging on the counter or in the door—no idleness whatever. If there is nothing to do you must make something to do.— There is a tier of broadcloths that are not well rolled up, and need fixing. Take them down one by one, and dust and replace them Stop— you want our private marks to know the price of goods. Here it is. f, you see stands for 1, z for 2, r for 3, t for 4, and so on. When you see, as on the mark to this piece of cassimeres, fxr together, and f,la beneath it, you are to understand that it cost $1,23 cents a yard, and sells for $196. This is our private mark, and you must on no account divulge it, as it is a part of a clerk's honor to keep it secret. Now you may go to the broadcloths, but leave them instantly any cusiomer wants anything; and if you can't find it, ask some one. You had best, perhaps, before you touch the broadcloths, walk along from shelf to shelf and learn what goods are on them, so that you may more easily find them when they are wanted.” Thus speaking, Mr. Cushing left him to speak with his clerk, and our poor hero began to walk along the shelves, his eyes too full of tears for him to distinguish calicoes from cottons.— Alas! Harry had brought his pride to a sad market. He had stood pale and almost overcome at the announcement of his series of duties.— Rise at six! he who had been permitted at home to lie till nine and then get a “pet breakfast” from his indulgent mother! Sweep out the store! a broom to degrade his hands, which he kept with such care! But more appalling than all, to have to clean and fill the lamps! His heart swelled within him; and, partly in anger, he pulled out his handkerchief, and stooping beneath the counter, secretly wiping his eyes. His manliness, however soon came to his aid, and, suppressing these feelings as well as he could, he pursued his first lesson—that of ascertaining the places of goods. The day passed off, but brought with it in its progress many petty mortifications in our hero's pride. The house at which he boarded did not suit his ideas either externally or internally. It was situated in a narrow court out of the lower part of Tremont street below the Mall; his room was with Ben Burnham in the attic; the table was meagre; the family a poor one, with a plenty of dirty children. He, however, got through the day and went to bed with a heavy heart, and his pride greatly fellen. In the morning he was roused at sunrise by the watchful Ben, who heretofore had opened the store and who now resolved to enjoy a luxury he had long been a stranger to—a half hour extra lounging in bed. “Come, Down East, its six o'clock?” he cried giving Harry a poke in the ribs for the third time, “if you don't have the store open by a quarter past old Cushing will give you a jaw. Come out of that.” Harry was sleepy with fatigue and sorrow, and was difficult to wake at such an unusual hour of rising. He at length opened his eyes, and seemed to get some idea of where he was and what was wanted of him. The events of the preceding day rushed upon him with all their painful reality, and sighing heavily, he got out of bed and begun to dress while Ben lay on his back, nicely rolled up in the coverlid, watching the process with no little satisfaction at the idea that it was not himself “I say, Down East, who made your coat?” he asked very gravely, “Why didn't you have them two gilt buttons put half a foot higher up on the back? it would ha made the skirts longer, and a prettier dovetail.” “My name is Henry Harefoot!” said Harry, angrily, in the act of thrusting his arms into the short-waisted olive, “and I will thank you not to call me by any other, nor make any more remarks about my dress.” “Hallo, Down East is up, I see!” said the mischievous Ben; but scarcely were the words out of his mouth, ere off came the olive, and Harry approached him, rolling up his sleeves and said, “I will not strike you down, Burnham—but get out of bed, and I will give you as sound a licking for that word as ever you got in your life.” Ben was not quite so tall but much heavier than Harry. His tongue however was always readier than his fist, and this sudden demonstration on the part of one who from the cut of his coat and his having come from the country he thought he could bully not a little surprised him. He felt no disposition to be “licked” and he well knew he should be if he accepted the new clerk's challenge. “Oh, you are angry are you,” he said in an appeasing tone; “I don't mean anything.” “Then be careful how you use your tongue,” replied Harry with decision. “That's right Harry; I like your spirit,” said Frank Stanwood and the other clerk running in from the next chamber in their shirts. “Up and fight him, Ben. Shame!” `I'd rather he here,' said Ben quietly wrapping himself in the quilt as if he meant to enjoy his leisure, yet half frightened at the scrape he had got into. “This is the first morning that I have had to lie in bed and I am not going to get up to be flogged.” “Make him get up, Kennebec,” said the other clerk. He was a stout, awkward young man, with a pug nose and yellow hair, and against whom Harry had taken an antipathy; and he now took quick offence at the impertinent appeallation he bestowed on him. “I will knock you down if you repeat that insult again,” he said quietly. “You will, hey?” growled the other closing his fist approaching him a step. Henry made no reply but resumed his coat and was about taking up his hat, when Tariton for such was his name said to Ben. `Call him `Down East,' Buraham, and I'll back you.' `Coward!' cried Frank indignantly; `afraid to insult him yourself and try to get another to do it for you!' `I'm not afraid! Who's afraid of a dandy Kennebecker like him!' `You dare n't call him Kennebec,' cried Ben from the bed clothes. `I say, Kennebec, how do you sell cider down East?' instantly demanded Tafton with a sneer. `I don't deal in cider but I do in claret,' retorted Harry; and with a well directed blow in Tarfton's face he sent the blood springing forth like a fountain from his nose, and pitched him at his length along the floor. `Good!' cried out Ben with glee produced by the operation of two gratifying causes; one was that Paul Tarfton was his habitual tormentor and he was rejoiced to see him punished; the other was the reflection that he himself was not in Tarfton's place. `You've served him right,' said Frank delighted. `You are a good fellow, Harry, and I knew you was when I first saw you.' Tarfton got up, and muttering with wrath and growling with pain hastened into his own chamber to repair damages, while Henry took the store key from the nail where it hung, above the three cornered piece of looking-glass, left the house to open the store, leaving behind him in the mind of Ben a great respect for his character; and a general impression upon his fellow clerks that proved afterwards very beneficial to him. It was twenty-five minutes past six, by the old South, when he placed the store-key in the wards of the lock. It was a difficult matter for him to find out how to unfasten the shutters and remove them, which he finally did without accident. He now found that he had to go to a pump in the next yard for the water to sprinkle with; but he went without a murmur, his victory having given him quite a willing and cheerful spirit. He found it hard work to sweep out the long store, and to dust the goods before the bell rung for seven. His lamps were yet untouched when Ben came down and seeing that they were as the last night left them obligingly offered to trim them, feeling it was for his interest to make friends with so powerful an opponent of Paul Tarfton. Harry had a better appetite for his breakfast than he had experienced for a long time, and he began to feel that setting aside carrying bundles and cleaning the lamps, he would be willing to submit to the remainder of his duties. He therefore began to contemplate entering into a compact with Ben, which should take these more degrading duties from his hands, when he felt he should get along very well and without much further humiliation of his pride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. A comparison between the two Apprentices—Our hero has a customer whose appearance produces a sensation—History of Ralph Mosley—Our hero's vanity, guilt and remorse—Harry makes an evil acquaintance by loitering—The Theatre— His principles stand the test of a Temptation— Frank Stanwood shows his true character—A dialogue, in which our hero does not come off the best—Harry is reminded of home—Meets Mosley—Mosley unfolds more of his character—Harry's meeting with the Apprentice—Mosley a spy, and his insolence. The first three or four weeks of Harry's apprentice (or clerk) ship passed away without any material incident or variation from the regular duties of opening, selling, carrying `small' bundles, and shutting up. He had effected an arrangement with Burnham with respect to the large packages and the lamps. He had got reconciled to his situation, and his pride had been very much lessened by the ordeal of little mortifications it had been subjected to. On the other hand, our young carpenter, Peirce Wentworth, had won favor with his master, and the good feeling towards him of all his fellow-workmen. He applied himself dilligently to his work, and evinced the possession of so much taste and skill, that the second week he was put to work on the nicer parts of his business, such as shaping mouldings for panels, carving ornaments for cornices, and the more delicate warkmanship, which required taste and neatness; and any one to see him cheerfully at work in his brown linen jackat at his tool-strewn bench, would have felt that his employment was far more dignified than that of Henry Harefoot, standing behind a counter strewn with silks, shirting, diaper, hose, searfs and other like articles, and dressed up in his spruce olive coat, (which he had had altered by a city tailor,) paste pin, azure vest, and nicely-combed perfumed hair, selling a paper of needles, or a corset-lacing to, perhaps, some slattern-serving girl.— Hitherto, the schoolmates had met but once, and this was when Henry was carrying a little package to a house in Beacon street, and Peirce was taking a window-sash to a house Mr. Libby was building; but Henry seeing him first, turned into a court to avoid him, not only because he did not like to be seen speaking to a carpenter's boy, but he dreaded that the apprentice would shake hands with him. He had met Isabel several times, and seeing her dressed neatly, had not disdained to recognize the frank bow and smile with which she met one whom she had known in her native town from childhood. At length one day she had come into the store to purchase some article, when her surprise at seeing Harry there caused her to blush and be confused for an instant, and to forget for a moment or two what she wished to purchase. Harry on his part not wishing to acknowledge the acquaintance in the presence of his fellow-apprentices, turned away scarcely noticing her as she asked him `how he did, and when he had heard from home.' `That was a fine young girl, Harry,' said Frank Stanwood with a glow of admiration as she left the store: `she seems to know you. Who is it? She is a stranger in the city.' `Yes,' said a young man about nineteen years of age, who was leaning on the counter, and had stared her rudely out of countenance as Frank was selling her the ribbon she came for,—`yes, a perfect little beauty! Where in the deuce did you know her, Harefoot? Ah, you sly Lothario! Did you see her color up when she saw him, Frank? I should like to be introduced, Harry.' Harry's first impulse was to deny any knowledge of her; for familiarity with her sweet face from childhood had rendered him insensible to its extreme beauty, and he regarded her not as a lovely girl, but simply as the daughter of a hatter. But the warm admiration of his friend Frank Stanwood, and the enthusiasm of his new acquaintance Ralph Mosley, led him to confess with a meaning smile, which was intended to convey what interpretation they chose to give, that `he had known her in Augusta.' `What is she?' inquired Mosely; `a milliner, I'll be sworn!' `Yes, she is;' answered Henry with surprise. `Her name, Henry?' `Isabel Wentworth.' `So you are a lucky dog, Harefoot! You must introduce me,' said Mosely. `Are her parents respectable?' asked Stanwood with interest. `Yes—that is—her father. I knew her only from seeing her occasionally, and coming up in the same vessel. Of course I did not visit her family.' `I suspect you know more of her than you will acknowledge, hey?' said Mosley with a laugh. Harry, to whom this conversation had conveyed the information that it is not in Boston degrading to know pretty little girls, whatever be their station, but rather a credit to be thought an acquaintance of them, had, we are sorry to say, too much vanity to silence such an intimation as Mosley's words conveyed, and so, by his silence and a mysterious look he confirmed it. His conscience for a moment troubled him; but the idea of being thought a `gay youth,' which he had been now long enough associating with clerks to understand the true signification of, silenced its reproaches for thus laying open to suspicion the character of a pure young girl, merely because she was the daughter of a mechanic. Several other questions were put to Harry by Mosley, who, be it here said, had been a clerk with a dry goods firm that had recently failed, and was now doing nothing. He was very dissipated and by no means a suitable companion for a young man like Henry Harefoot, who up to this time had been a youth of unexceptionable moral habits; his vices being those of vanity, pride, and love of approbation, rather those of the head than the heart. He was annoyed by the boldness and licence of Mosley's questions in relation to Miss Wentworth, and regretted that he had given him the idea upon which he had taken the liberty he now assumed. He felt that he had by his vanity and imprudence conveyed to the dissolute youth the impression that he himself was as corrupt as he. This reflection excessively annoyed and pained him; for although in a moment of weak vanity he had intimated his having been a friend of the young milliner in such a way as to let him as well as Frank put their own construction upon it, he felt he was not prepared to place his character, as he feared he had irrevocably done, in the hands of one who had so little regard for his reputation. With these distressing convictions foreing themselves upon him, he abruptly turned away from them both, to change whose opinion of him he felt he would cheerfully have given his right hand. Tears came to his eyes; and the injury he had done to himself and to Isabel Wentworth impressed him so vividly, that his pride and fear of Mosley's sneers alone prevented him from at once confessing the wrong he had done her as well as the injustice he had put upon his own character, which was yet pure. The moral courage to have taken this noble step would perhaps have saved him many a day of woe into which the want of it at that crisis of his life, afterward plunged him. Mosley left the store with the impression that Harry Harefoot was as bad as himself; that he had found in him a congenial spirit; and rejoicing with the anticipation of being through him made acquainted with Isabel Wentworth. The character of Ralph Mosley is soon drawn. His father was a lawyer in Salem, with a large family, a great deal of that foolish pride which looks upon a mechanical pursuit as degrading, and with a very little money. Unable to send his sons to college he put them into stores—those hot-beds of gentility, in which the young plant is so forced that it too often perishes ere it come to flower. Ralph had been taken from school at the age of fifteen and placed in a dry goods store in Salem; but he was too inattentive to please his employer, had a bad habit of swearing because he thought it genteel, and always was ready to lie when it suited his convenience. From Salem his father brought him to Boston, and placed him in an importing house. Here he dissatisfied his master, and left under the suspicion of having appropriated sundry pieces of goods which had been missed. He remained idle a few weeks, not notifying his father of his being in no employment, during which time he had plenty of money and dressed well. He at length got a place with a dry goods dealer in Market street, where he remained until his employer failed a few days before he is now made known to the reader. During his residence in the city and his intervals of idleness, he had managed to get thoroughly initiated into all the evil habits of the town; was familiar with every haunt of vice and dissipation, and lived only for the purpose of indulging in the gross and unrestrained indulgence of his passions. The darker shades of his character were not known, however, so openly as we have found it necessary to unfold them; for he was careful to conceal from the public eye as much of his true character as was necessary to preserve his intercourse with society. Harry had been introduced to him by Ben one evening, when after they had shut up, instead of going home, they walked round, at Burnham's suggestion, past the Federal street theatre, to see the lights and the crowd, and ladies in their splendid dresses, descending from carriages and entering, a favorite amusement of Ben. Ralph was standing on the steps, and recognizing Burnham, who also came from Salem, he asked him if he was going to the play. Ben replied that he had no money—when Ralph offered him a pit ticket. `I can't go without this chap,' said Ben in a low voice. `Who is he?' `Our new clerk from Kennebec.' `Has he got any money?' `Yes.' `Introduce me.' The young men shook hands, and Ralph suggested to him to go in and see the play. Henry had never been in a theatre in his life, and had great curiosity to attend; but he did not like to go without Mr. Cushing's permission, and declined, giving his reason. Ralph laughed loudly at this, and Ben said that `old Cushing would never know it, and if he did he would not care a snap.' Henry, however, had made up his mind when he saw how kind Mr. Cushing was, and that he made his situation pleasant to him in spite of its servile (as he considered it) character, to strive to please him; he was therefore firm till quite assured both by Ben and Mosley that it was quite a common thing for all clerks to go to the theatre, and that their employers had nothing to do with their movements out of the store. Still he did not wish to go without leave, and replied, `But I have no money with me.' `O, I'll lend you, pay me to-morrow,' said Mosley, displaying a handful of silver. `I don't like to borrow of a stranger.' `Ha, ha! a stranger,' repeated Ralph; `why, man, how formal you are! There's no ceremony between clerks. We shall be the best friends in the world.' Mosley finding he could not prevail upon his new acquaintance, left him, taking Ben with him, saying he hoped they should see each other again. The next time they met was the morning of Isabel Wentworth's call to the store, the results of which are already given. Thus led by curiosity out of his way to visit a place of dissipation, our hero fell in with an acquaintance whom else he might never have seen, and whose companionship was the cause of much of the sufferings and guilt of his after life. But for this, the healthy action of constant employment in the store, the daily beneficial lessons his pride was receiving, and the daily improvement his character underwent beneath the eye of Mr. Cushing might have produced out of the mixed materials which composed it, one virtuous, wise and noble. Mosley had left the store but a few minutes when Frank Stanwood approached him, and said in a serious tone of voice, and with earnestness, `By Heaven, Harefoot, I did not believe till now you were such a character as you have acknowled yourself to be,—and reading in your Bible every day, and praying, too, as Burnham tells! can it be possible that beneath all that quick sensibility, reserve of manner, and show of piety, lies the dissolute character of a rake. I would not have believed it of you otherwise than from your own lips—nor can I hardly credit now that the beautiful girl with the soft eyes who spoke to you so blushingly, and whom I sold that ribbon to, is other than virtuous. If you have seduced her, you deserve the contempt of every honorable mind.' `I did not say so,' replied Henry, confounded by this address, and ready to sink with shame beneath the clear hazel eye and ringing speech of the generous spirited youth; he was relieved also, that even at the expense of deep shame he should have this opportunity of doing justice both to her and to his own reputation; for he now was thoroughly convinced that the reputation he had wished to establish was not one which was at all admired by Frank Stanwood. `I said I had known her at Augusta.' `You gave me and that unprincipled young man Mosely, whom I caanot endure, to understand that you knew her intimately, and in a way that would admit of but one interpretation.' `I did not mean to have such a construction placed upon my reply to Mosley,' answered Henry, compelled to resort to a falsehood, for which he felt still more degraded in his own eyes. `Do you mean to say that I have put a wrong interpretation on your words?' `Yes, she is above suspicion; and I regret, Frank, you should have suspected me of conduct of which I certainly would not be guilty. You have done me injustice.' `I have certainly done her injustice,' he said warmly; `and I am pained that for a moment I should have associated her pure and spiritual face with shame. You did mean to convey, Harefoot, something gratifying to your vanity,' added Stanwood, fearlessly; `and I am glad you have been so frank as to destroy the impression. When you see Mosley correct it with him; for he will be sure to insult her if he dare. It is also due to your own reputation. I am glad for your sake that you are free from the stain; and I hope, as a friend, Harry, you will never let any weak and wicked vanity tempt you a second time to convey suspicions of your own character, and blast that of an innocent person. I regret you have already imbibed the infamous vanity so common with young clerks in the city, to be thought to be intimate with females. No vice can be more contemptible. Harry was both angry and humbled at these words of his fellow-clerk; for he felt that he had failed in screening himself from his clear-sighted perception of the truth even behind the curtain of deception he had drawn before his guilt. The result of this was in a degree a loss of confidence in Harry on the part of Stanwood, who entertained a real friendship for him, and a feeling of dislike and suspicion on Henry's side—the natural consequence of shame and exposure. It did not, however, affect their open intercourse, which continued through the day as before. It was not so easy, however, for Henry to disabuse Ralph Mosley of the wicked impression his spotted mind had received. He believed virtue merely a name among the industrious and useful class of young women to which Isabel Wentworth belonged, and that the greatest achievement of a young clerk like himself would be to lure one from the paths of honor, or plunge into deeper infamy any one that bucks of his stamp had succeeded in ruining. He also found it as hard to believe that any young man was purer than himself, or if the temptation offered would not go as far in guilt. He laughed at virtue in young men, and termed it methodism and cant; and in his heart believed those who seemed the most correct in their habits only wore a disguise which fear has adopted to hide excesses from the eye of the world. Such was the character of the young man into whose keeping Harry had weakly and irretrievably placed his own character and the unsullied reputation of a poor girl. Ill at ease with himself all day, it was with no little relief when he heard the clock strike eight, and the order to shut up given by Mr. Martin, who, after remaining to see the last light extinguished, and turning the key in the door himself, as was his custom, gave it to him. Harry stood a moment by the door to look at the moon, which called to mind his native village and the verdant banks on which he loved to stray by its clear light, and brought up all the associations of home. He thought of the two or three village girls he had liked best, and of the one he most prized of all! of his mother, who with true piety had given his young mind its bent, and with motherly care and anxiety had striven to eradi cate the seeds of vice, and implant those of virtue; who in parting had prayed with him in her closet, and given him a Bible with his name written in it in her own hand, with the affectionate request that he would read it daily and never forget his duties to God. How painful were the reflections of conscience that forced themselves upon his mind as he thought of these injunctions, and then upon the guilt he had heaped upon his soul that day— glorying in imaginary crime, defaming the mnocent, and darkening the sacred light in the precious gem of his own reputation. `I have indeed been foolish and wicked, and deserve not only the contempt of Stanwood, who has shown a noble character to-day, but the anger of Heaven. I wish I could see Mosley, to do away the evil I have done. Ah, here he comes.' At this moment the person he named came from the opposite side of the street with a quick step and not at first seeing Harry who stood in the shadow of the street lamp, he went to the door of the store, tried it with his hand and then said in a tone of disappointment, `Confound it! I am too late—he is off.' `Mosley!' called out Harry approaching him. `Oh, you have not left yet, Harefoot! I feared I was too late and you had gone home,' he said, familiarly putting his arm through Henry's. `Did you want to see me?' `Yes. About that pretty girl you know. You must tell me where she lives and introduce me.' `Oh, I was only joking this morning,' answered Henry with embarrassment and feeling his cheeks were red with the crimson of shame. `What! don't you know her then? I am sure she spoke to you and you both colored. Now don't think to come off so, Harefoot?' `I meant that I knew nothing derogatory to her character. She is from the same town I am and I have known her only as young people know each other that are brought up together.' `Then you have not seduced her!' `By heaven, no!' answered Harry, startled by the bold language which his own conduct had given license to. `If I gave you any such idea from my words or manner this morning I wish to take this opportunity to correct it. Her reputation is without a stain so far as I know and believe.' `Well, let it be so—though I don't believe you.' `Don't believe me,' retorted Harry quickly.— `Do you mean to say you doubt my word?' `No—but that you fear I shall see her and cut you out, and so you wish to make me think you don't visit her.' `Upon my honor, I never spoke to her but in the street and in open day, in my life, until she came passenger with her father and brother in the same vessel up to the city.' `She has a brother, then. Is he here?' asked Mosley eagerly. `Yes. An apprentice with a Mr. Benjamin Libby a housewright.' `What kind of a chap is he?' `A steady, good-hearted and very clever young man, I think, though I have never of course associated with him before we came from home, and much less here.' `And yet you know his sister! Ah, Harry, I believe you are deeper than you wish to fathom.' `You will make me angry, Ralph Mosley it you allude to this again when I have so solemnly assured you your construction of my thoughtless manner this morning is erroneous—that your interpretation is wholly gratuitous.' Thus Harry was by no means wanting in his endeavors to remove the evil his idle vantity had created; but he found that the shadow of guilt if it falls across purity sullies it; and that it was not so easy to remove the idea from his mind as it had been to convey it. `But I can't see how you can know a pretty girl at all in her class without having some little flirtation with her. Well, so much the better! I will have a fair field.' `For what?' `For making her acquaintance. You will introduce me of course.' `No.' `Blunt enough! Afraid of your bird! Well I shall find a way.' `I repeat, she is no bird of mine; and if you form an acquaintance with her from what I have said this morning, you make me your enemy.' `Well let it drop! I see you don't care to be thought rakish! Where are you going to-night?' `Home, to finish a book of travels I got out of the Merchant's library? Mr. Cushing was so kind as to give me a ticket for the quarter.' `Pooh! who would be so silly to stay stuck up in the house these fine evenings, when there is so much life and amusement going on all over town.' `I prefer reading to going out nights.' `Your pretend to be very green and innocent. Haven't you been out an evening since you came to Boston?' `No.' `Then I have a good deal to show you! Come you must go to the theatre! There is to be a capital play and I know you will enjoy yourself.' `I have'nt permission.' `Can't. Are you not your own master, evenings? You don't board with Mr. Cushing?' `No—but I had rather be at home. My head is aching violently, and I am not well. Here is where I turn up to my boarding house.' While conversing they had been walking up Washington street until they came to Boylston, where Mosley stopped. `I don't know what to make of you, Harefoot,' he said, after a moment's silence, `and I see you mistrust me. But we shall understand each other better by and by. If you will go home, good night.' Henry laid his aching head on his pillow that night with reflections of a most painful character. With all his weaknesses, vanity, love of dress and personal admiration, he had never been guilty of so great an error of the heart as he had suffered himself to fall into that day. He felt mortified with himself and pained that he should have been instrumental in giving a shadow of suspicion to the name of Isabel Wentworth. He rose in the morning with a resolution to guard against a failing which had brought him such anguish and might be productive of such painful consequences to the innocent victim of it. On his way to open the store in the morning, as he traversed the streets in which were few persons, save the milkmen, and early laborers, sewing girls and apprentices, each wending to their places of daily toil, he was almost overpowered at seeing beneath the cottage hat of a young and finely shaped girl who was removing the shutters of a milliner's shop the pretty bright face of Isabel Wentworth. His first emotion was, with the rushing recollection of the injury he had done her, a sense of shame with a desire to pass unseen.— The next impulse was a generous feeling of kindness. Seeing her here was the first intimation he had of her keeping in the same street with himself. She had not discovered him her face being turned upwards in disengaging one of the leaves of the shutters which seemed to catch at the top. A violent effort suddenly disengaged it and unused to manage the weight it heeled over upon her, and would have borne her with it to the pavement or injured her in its fall but for the interposition of Henry's arm, who under the impulse of his penitent feelings was the moment before struggling with his pride whether to offer his assistance in removing the shutters or pass by. This incident decided the mental controversy and he held up the shutter clear of her head till she crept out beneath his arm unhurt. `It is you, Henry,' she said, blushing. `You were very kind.' `I am happy, Miss Isabel, to have been so fortunate as to serve you at this juncture. The shutter is too heavy for a young girl like you! They are much heavier than my own;' he added placing it down on the side walk beneath the bow-win do. Allow me to remove the remainder! You must be with an unfeeling person to put this task upon you. `No—Mrs. Prescott is not aware how heavy the shutters are; and besides I don't usually open the shop; but the other apprentice has not been well for the last two mornings. You have a nice store. I did not know where you kept till yesterday.' Her allusion to this source of all his shame and vexation of the previous day suggested to him an idea that he thought would prevent any evil whatever resulting from his indiscretion. And after gazing a moment upon her fine open ingenuous countenance where all was purity and innocence, while his heart smote him, he said, `Did you notice that young man standing in the store, Miss Isabel?' `Yes,' she answered with readiness, blushing and dropping her eves; for she had been thinking of Frank Stanwood who had waited on her and whose fine eyes had more than once met her's during the little purchases she had made, a dozen times since; and so she thought Harry must mean him and no one else. `Well, I think it my duty, Miss Wentworth to warn you against forming an aquaintance with him or even permitting him to speak to you. He is a profligate young man, in the atmosphere of whose reputation your own would wither like a blight!' Isabel fixed her large earnest eyes upon him as he earnestly addressed her while her young bosom heaved, and her cheek became pale; for hope, sweet hope, was all at once blasted in the first day of its budding. How Frank managed, unconscious to himself, to produce such an impression upon a young girl's heart, who, for the first time, interchanged words with him, and then about the price of a ribbon, is known only to Cupid and his myrmidons whose random shots do so much mischievous execution. `I—I—thought he looked like a very nice young gentleman. He is certainly handsome. Can he be so wicked?' she asked with innocent surprise. `Yes, he is handsome and dresses well, I admit, and is very fascinating when he chooses, but he is, nevertheless, a person I feel it my duty to warn you against. He saw you in the store today and says he means to make your acquaintance The acquaintance of such a person, Isabel, will bring with it lasting regret. `I am sure you are very kind, Henry Harefoot. I don't know how to thank you. I have been told you were proud and felt yourself above others; but your kindness this morning has shewn me that you have had injustice done you. I am sure I shall never forget you.' This was spoken in so sweet a tone and with so much warmth of manner that Harry let his gaze rest upon her face wondering he had not before discovered how very beautiful she was His earnest look abashed her and feeling its rudeness he bade her good morning while she entered the shop. The first object that met his eye on moving forward was Ralph Mosley standing on the opposite corner from whence he had been watching the brief interview between Harry and Isabel Wentworth. On discovering him there the blood in spite of himself mounted to his face as if he had been guilty of some wrong. He saw that he bore traces of his last night's dissipation on his pale countenance and detected a sinister and evil look as he encountered him. `So, my pious Joseph,' he said, laying his hand on Harry's shoulder and placing his fore-finger significantly against the side of his nose; `that was the end of your `travels' over the way, hey! and there, I dare say they cure the head-ache very nicely.' His manner, not to speak of the base insinuation his words conveyed, was in the highest degree offensive to Harry. If he had obeyed the impulse of his spirit he would have struck him down; but he could not conceal from his own conscience that he had placed himself in some degree in his power by his admission of the day before, the impressions from which his false assertions to the contrary removed neither from the mind of Mosley or of Stanwood. He was therefore compelled to restrain his angry feelings, suffer him to take his arm and walk on with him and endure his disgusting remarks upon what he had discovered. It was in vain that Harry asserted the truth. The profligate mind of Mosley could not comprehend or receive it. Truth from Henry's mouth had lost its talismanic charm with him; for he had taken Henry's silence, smile and significant admissions the yesterday morning for precisely what Henry in his foolish vanity intended; and by no subsequent retraction had he got any credit other than for duplicity. Isabel was not so deeply enamored that the warning of Harry made her miserable.—She sighen as he left her, wondered that so handsome a young man should be so profligate; and she resolved, while a tear started to her lid that from that moment she would think no more of him; and twenty times that day when he came into her thoughts she made the same resolution.</field>

Which begins with some remarks upon Mosley's character—The Soda Shop—The bill rendered —Mosley in difficulties—Threatened with Jail— A struggle, and his departure—A sleeping room and its inmate—Mosley shows the object of his visit—Disappointed—Ellen Emery and her history—Mosley and Ellen decide on a separation— A plan proposed by Ralph—Our hero manifestly in peril—Ellen enters into the plan—They separate, each prepared to play their part. When a young man has been so unhappy as to yield to all the wayward impulses of passion, until he has lost his self respect, the pillars of which are integrity and virtue, he gradually imbibes, like the insensible impulse of deadly poison, a hatred towards those whom he finds are yet upright; and is tortured with a wicked and restless desire to bring them down to his own level; for, so long as they stand upon the noble elevation of an upright character, they serve to show more prominently from what height he himself has fallen, and more clearly to mark the depth of his own degradation. Such were the feelings of Ralph Mosley with reference to Harry Harefoot, when, after reflecting on the conversation that passed between them, he arrived, at length, to a just estimate of his character; acquiting him of all suspicion of guilt with reference to Isabel Wentworth, and attributing the manner and words with which he had given him a wrong impression, alone to a vanity, too common among young men, which led him to wish to be thought in favor with a person whom his fellow-clerk thought so worthy of notice. Having satisfied his own mind that Harry was sincere in all he had said, and that he was quite free from all vice and possessed a remarkably ingenuous and open character; and having learned from Burnham and Tarfton, as well as he discerned in his conversation with him, the weak points of his character, which led him to wish to conceal the fact of his being from the country; to feel above his place; to be ambitious to be considered `a young gentleman' in the eyes of the ladies; and to imitate the manners and air of the gay young men about town; (all of which, we are sorry to have to say of our hero, was true) he resolved to give variety to his idle life, as well as for the pleasing gratification of the pursuit, to endeavor to lead Harry into the temptations by which he himself had fallen, as well as to avenge himself for his firm and virtuous refusal to give him an introduction to the pretty milliner's apprentice—his acquaintance with whom he envied him. He also hoped to replenish his purse, by his means, if he could tempt him once to stray. He could not forgive him either because he had never been `out of nights'; because when he himself was seeking pleasure through the haunts of vice, Harry was peacefully reading, and improving his mind in his chamber at home! he could not forgive him because he had refused to attend the theatre without permission; because he had once refused to drink with him; because he was yet free from the gross and licentious indulgences which degraded his own mind, and shattered his own fair fame! As Mosley made these resolutions in his heart; he was seated in a box at a drinking room, near the head of Franklin street, where he had gone after quitting Harry, who felt not a little relieved at his departure; for he did not like to be seen walking in the street with him. He was leaning upon a table. Upon a finger of his thin, delicate hand, blazed with a deep rich light, a massive ruby, its hue strikingly contrasting with the paleness of his cheek, which the hand supported.— His long, waving brown hair, was dry and disordered; his fine broadcloth coat was covered with bed-lint, as if he had slept without undressing; the ruffle of his shirt was soiled and untidy; his vest unbuttoned; his boots without polish; and his whole appearance and air that of a dissipated young man, the morning after a revel. With a good education; a generous temper; an intelligent mind; and uncommon talent and address, this young man had been launched on the voyage of life without compass or chart, and was now stranded on the very shores of his departure. The error and shame of this surely must lie at some door. Justice and truth will place it at the paternal threshold, from which, mercenary motives, false pride, which would see a son clerking, rather than learning a useful trade, a slavish submission to a false system of society which has slain its thousands, drove him at that tender age, when, if ever, he needed, and solemnly required the guiding, protecting, defending, sacred care of a parent. `I say, O'Bruce!' he at length muttered, slowly lifting his heavy eye-lids; for coming into the apartment after his walk in the morning air, had relaxed his nerves and sickened him. `Well, Ralph,' civilly answered a short, fullfaced, and dark-complexioned man, with a pleasant expression of his features. `I—I say, O'Bruce!' he muled with a whining cry. `Well.' `O'Bruce, I say!' he repeated, as if he had forgotten that he had bofore spoken. `You want some soda, I guess, Mosley.' `Yes—you know—you un'stand! so—so—da' That last glass of bitters I took in at the Washington Garden was vile stuff. It made me sick.— Pah!' While the soda was being drawn, he left the box, staggered weakly up to the counter, received it in his shaking grasp, and drank it down with the eagerness of a thirsty man. `That's reviving! I'll stop taking wine at night, Bruce! I drank at that infernal third row bar, and they sell such wretched stuff there that I was sick all night. Give me another glass of soda, with a little dash of raw brandy! That's enough! Ah, that is a feeler, and braces me up! I won't be caught again drinking to be sick after it, as I have been this morning! That brandy has made me feel nice! I'll go out to the barber's! Just put them glasses down to me, Bruce!' `I have made cut your hill, Mr. Mosley,' gravely said the keeper of the shop, for `Soda and Rochelle waters,'—as this place of youthful dissipation was innocently designated upon the sign above the door. `Oh, let it stand, Bruce!' I'll pay up Saturday,' said Mosley, coloring, and feeling in vain in his pockets for what he well knew, and the other had reason to suspect, was not there. `I have trusted you now four weeks beyond my time, and you have promised to pay every Saturday,' answered the keeper of the bar-room, sullenly. `If I got a place, I said.' `I heard no such if. I want my money,' repeated the soda man, firmly. `Well, let me look at the hill,' said Mosley, turning back and taking from him with a colorless cheek, the very long piece of paper; which, as it was a correct minute of the events of the few weeks past, we will make a tranuscript of one day's record, while Mosley, to gain time to frame an excuse, is reading it over with a sinking sipirit. SEPT. 9th, morning, two bitters, two sodas, two brandies with Bob Silsby. SEPT. 9th, 11 A. M. 3 pieces of pie and two brandy toddies. SEPT. 9th, 1 P. M. bitters for self and Ned Lynch. SEPT. 9th, 4 P. M. 12 gin cock tails, 4 cream cakes, 2 dishes blackberries, and 2 Port wine sangrees, for self and Bob Silsby. SEPT. 9th, 5 P. M. loaned half a dollar. SEPT. 9th, 6 1-2 P. M. paid for breaking Gragg's chaise, $3,60, riding in from Fresh Pond, Sunday, loaned 2s 6d. SEPT. 9th, 11 1-2 P. M. to bottle champangne with Bob Silsby, and to breaking two tumblers and three wine glasses and smashing a chair. SEPT. 9th, 12 1-2 A. M. to breaking door pannel to get in after shutting up, and to treating two watchmen to let you off. The entire amount of this precious bill was twenty-seven dollars and a half. Our ex-clerk read over a few items with a sort of cool desperation, and then finding the task too much for him, he laid the account on the bar, and looked at his creditors unmoved, yet money expecting countenance, with a feeling of despair. He could call up no energy of mind to meet the exigency, for there is nothing which so weakens the resources of the mind, and so paralyzes them when called upon, as intemperance. `It's a larger bill than I thought for, Bruce,' he gasped, faintly; `can't you give me a little time?' `No—my chance of getting paid is becoming less every day. You are in no business. You must settle it, or I will make you.' `But you don't mean to sue me, Bruce?' he inquired, with alarm. `If I cannot get it any other way! I have lost money enough by such swells as you are, and I am not going to lose any more,' he answered, with an oath. `Don't get angry I—I can't pay it, Bruce— don't throw me into jail! It would disgrace me! I know you wouldn't take advantage of me. I have always been a good customer,' he pleaded, pitifully. `Such customers would soon send me to jail.' `I brought Silsby here, and he has spent a good deal of money, and pays well.' `If Silsby is your friend, he'll lend you the money.' `No, he won't, for I owe him already,' he answered, faintly. `Well, you must get it some how, or go to jail,' said the bar-keeper resolutely, quietly burnishing the brass ornaments on his soda fountain. Mosely glanced at the face of his customer, and then at the long piece of paper that gave such an eloquent history of his dissipations, and hung his head in painful reflection, not upon his follies, for he was not penitent, but to invent some way of getting out of the difficulty. At length he spoke with animation and confidence. `Give me till to-morrow morning, and I positively promise to settle it, O'Bruce.' `This is only a plea to leave the city.' `No, upon my honor. I know where I can get it. I will leave you my rings and brooch as security for my return.' `They are not worth a quarter of the bill.' `Upon my honor I will come back with the money,' said Mosley, going towards the door. `You don't leave this house until I am paid, or you give me security,' said O'Bruce, jumping to the door, closing it, and turning the key. `Pay me, sir, or go to jail.' The dread of imprisonment overcame in the bosom of Mosley every other feeling, and the natural energy and decision of his character momentarily recovered from the depression caused by habitual intemperance. He suddenly seized the astonished man by the throat, and threw him across a bench, and there held him with the grasp of desperation. `Say you will let me go without troubling me,' he said, speaking menacingly through his closed teeth, `and I will let you off. Otherwise I swear by Heaven I will take your life. I pledge you on my word that I will pay your infernal bill tomorrow morning. Will you let me go without molestation?' `Yes,' gasped the man with difficulty articulating the word. `Will you swear not to molest me, either, for this assault?' `Yes, if I am paid to-morrow.' `Then get up. It is your own fault, all this, Bruce! You might have let me gone! I will pay you, I repeat tomorrow! I did not mean to hurt you, and I hope I havn't; but I would take any man's life that would put me in jail.' Thus speaking Mosley turned the key in the door, opened it, and went out into the street, leaving the proprietor too much confounded to offer any obstacle to his departure, which he did not, on reflection, wish to do, as he had suffered no personal injury, and hoped yet to get paid; his love of money being paramount to his desire of avenging himself; and so, with the wise resolution to await the issue of another day, he adjusted his damaged collar, and busied himself with affairs behind the bar. After stopping a few moment's in a barber's shop to arrange his hair and attire, and get his boots polished, greatly to the improvement of his exterior, for he was studious of making a good appearance in the street, Ralph Mosley took his way along Washington street, passing the Old South as the bell was ringing for seven. He glanced in at Mr. Cushing's store, where he saw Harry dusting the goods, but did not linger, and turning up School street, he walked rapidly into Beacon street, and there turning from it by the west side of the State House, crossed Mount Vernon, and passed from that well built and respectable part of the city into one of the narrow lanes of a quarter, which, at that period, was thronged with the abodes of vice, wretchedness and crime. Descending a steep street containing a better order of houses than the others, he came to a narrow court, shaded with sickly looking trees, at the extremity of which stood a three story brick dwelling, of a more decent appearance than its neighbors. After casting his glance quickly up and down the street, to see if he was watched by any one whose observation he would avoid he turned into the alley, and approached the house. The shutters were all closed, but the front door was ajar, and yielded to his hand. Softly he entered and carefully closed it behind him. The entry was still, and a lamp half expiring was flickering on the lower stair. At his left hand was a door, partly open. `Yes,' he said within himself, `all is as I hoped! Not one has stirred since I got up at five and went out, that vile wine not letting me sleep. I wish I had staid in before I had seen and had that scrape with O'Bruce; but that was well paid for by discovering where Harefoot's little rustic beauty kept. Now, if Ellen is not awake, I shall get what I came after. If she discovers me, I can easily frame an excuse for returning.' Thus reflecting, Mosley softly pushed open the door to the front room, on the first floor and noiselessly entered. All was as he had left it when he rose, feverish and sleepless three hours before, save that a broad sunbeam shone in through a broken shutter, and fell upon the bed. Upon it, with her cheek pillowed in her hand, lay an extremely young and lovely girl, sleeping as sweetly as if the dove of innocence had not taken his flight from her bosom. Mosley approached and bent over her. The quiet repose of the limbs, and her regular breathing, assured him of her slumber. With a stealthy step and a look of inward gratification, he left the bedside, and advanced, with cautious glances towards her, in the direction of a bureau on the opposite side of the chamber. Upon it was a small esretoire, which, from the eager grasp he laid upon it, was plainly the object of his wishes. He carefully tried it, and found it was locked. `Curse it!' he muttered; `the girl mistrusts me! She needn't lock from me what I have myself given her. But I must not be foiled.' After a short search he found a ring of keys, one of which fitted the desk. Withdrawing with it out of sight, where he could be screened by the curtain, he opened it; but the deeply disappointed look his countenance instantly expressed, showed that what he sought was missing. `Could she have suspected I should ever want the watch, and so has hidden it from me! Confound the girl! I saw her place it here last night. By heaven! I am in a mind to wake her and demand it of her! But then I know her firmness, and she would refuse to give it up! No, I see I have no chance of paying O'Bruce here! But perhaps it is in the bureau, or under her pillow! With the threat of a jail before me I must risk something!' Locking and replacing the little rose-wood box, he searched the beaurea-drawers, and every place, but beneath her pillow. There, he was at length convinced, must be the valuable watch which he had bought with a portion of the money he had obtained by fraudulently selling goods from his employer's store on his own account, and had some weeks before presented to her, or rather out of which she had coaxed him. It was the prospect of getting possession of this upon which he had based his confident promise to pay Bruce; as he knew, by pawning it, he could get forty or fifty dollars upon it. His disappointment, and its anticipated consequences, filled him with despair, and prompted him to take a bold step to recover his gift, and so possess the means of saving himself from being put in prison, as well for the debt as for the assault; for he was well aware that if he did not pay O'Bruce, he should be not only imprisoned for the former, but also indicted for the latter. In this guilty dilemma, the young man, for an instant, let the idea of murder enter and linger in his mind; but only for an instant, for he banished the temptation with a shudder! Yet he felt he must save himself! `Would it not,' it occurred to him, `be best to wake her, and demand it of her.' But this course he rejected, knowing her character, and that when she knew he was so wholly without resources, she would treat him with contempt. His situation required action of some kind, and he resolved to search the pillow.' She did not wake; and he even ventured to raise her head, and lift its abundant cloud of fair hair from her arm. But he turned away disappointed, with a deep curse upon his lips, and then stood a few moments deliberating. Suddenly his features brightened up! The light of hope returned to his sullen eye, and his form became firmly erect again! `I have it! Silsby will do it. I shall find him at the Exchange! Confound the little suspicious vixen, with her, watch! Let her keep it. It is the last jewelry I can lavish on her, She has been my ruin, and I will get rid of her as soon as I can.— But I cannot speak against her,' he said aloud.— `She is a noble, generous creature, and it is a pity she can never be other than her love for me has made her. But it is as much her fault as mine. Yet we must part. She expects it, and I have determined on it.' `Who are you speaking about, Ralph? Why I thought you had gone out,' said the sleeper waking and fixing upon him a pair of fine hazel eyes the beauty of which was marred by the slight inflammation of dissipation and late hours. `I was speaking of you, Ellen,' he said, approaching her and coloring. `What o'clock is it?' `Look at your watch,' he said quickly. `I believe it has run down,' she replied, placing her hand in her bosom and drawing forth, with a peculiar smile, a beautiful gold lever, the hour-hand of which pointed to III. Mosley bit his lip with vexation; but he had already calculated for relief from another source, and to this now determined to look for the funds he wanted. But her smile moved his suspicions. `What does that knowing look mean?' he asked, half guessing the truth. `That I have not been asleep and very well know what you have been searching for,' she said, smiling and significantly tapping the watch with her finger. `Did you hide your watch from me?' he asked, angrily. `Yes, Don't you know you desired me yesterday to let you take it to the watchmaker's, when I knew there was nothing the matter with it. I have not seen my brooch nor ear-rings you took there, last week.' `But I gave them to you, Ellen,' he said sharply. `And now you would take them away again. I want twenty dollars, Ralph.' `Twenty devils!' `Why, what is the matter?' `I have no money.' `And so you wanted to rob me of my watch.— The rent is due next week.' `I can't pay it.' `I am sure I cannot,' she said warmly. `The truth is, I can't support you any longer, Ellen?' he said, walking to the opposite side of the room, as if to avoid her look. `No!' she exclaimed raising herself up with alarm quick in her paling countenance. `No. I am run out! worse and worse every day. I have this morning been threatened with jail.' `What shall I do if you desert me?' `Find some one else fool enough to keep you.' `How can you talk so cruelly! I have been true to you. This degraded condition—an unmarried wife—is not my fault. I loved you and when you brought me to Boston you shamefully deceived me. I was taken in a web of lies.' `And your own silly vanity furnished the warp,' he retorted. `But that is past. I am sorry, Ellen; but I cannot support this way of living. You must find some other friend. I may have to leave the city yet. I would see you taken care of— Silsby or Lynch, or some of the fellows who have supped here with me, would be glad to take you off my hands.' `Oh, God, I have been expecting this,' said the young girl, with tears gushing from her eyes; and burying her face in the pillow, she wept like an infant. Ellen Emery was now in her eighteenth year. She was a native of Salem and had known Mosley from a child; but her mother, the widow of a sea-captain, being poor, Ellen did not move in the same society. After he had been in Boston long enough to learn its vices, on one of his visits to Salem he was struck with the beauty of Ellen Emery who was assisting her mother in keeping a mantuamaker's shop. Ellen was susceptible; had been a great deal flattered, was vain of her personal attractions and therefore felt not a little gratified when she saw the gay and handsome Ralph Mosley, `from Boston,' added to her admirers. Ralph was artful in the art of pleasing, and his engaging manners and superior address as well as the respectability of his family soon made their impress on upon her. When he discovered this preference for his society and that she was flattered by his attentions he resolved to make her his victim. He brought her presents from the city; told her how greatly her charms eclipsed those of the Boston belle, and that she ought to go to Boston just to create a sensation in Washington street. Such language with a show of warm attachment, and an increasing perseverance soon won her regard, while he returned her no love, but merely amused her with its false outside. At length by making use of her beauty as the talisman of his power he so far ingratiated himself into her confidence as to dare to propose to her an elopement to Boston, there to be married; and he so far overcame her faint objections by overwhelming her with vows and protestations as to get her consent to this rash step. On the pretence of going to church in the afternoon of a Sabbath, the imprudent girl met him at the foot of the street that led to her mother's house, where he waited for her in a stylish gig he had hired the evening before in Boston for this purpose, so confident was he of her weakness. The unprincipled young man lifted her into the chaise with guilty triumph, and drove rapidly off; the deluded girl, leaving behind her scenes of childhood that she was never to behold in innocence again. He took care to amuse her during the two hours ride to the city, so that she should not have time to reflect and repent of the step, as she might have done, her imagination having been more touched than her heart. But she had listened to his flattery, been vain of his attention, aspired to associate with those in a condition the aristocracy of society had placed above her, and ruin was the consequence. Mosley had in fact won her, as many a foolish girl is won, almost wholly through compliments to her beauty. During the drive to town she was in fine spirits, for all before her was bright with the sunshine of hope. `She was soon to be a bride, live in a fine house in Boston, and be admired for her beauty! and wouldn't she triumph over all her young acquaintances in Salem!' were the gilded thoughts that filled her mind. Such were her meditations as they rolled across Charlestown bridge and rattled along the pavements of the city streets. After riding some distance into the midst of the city, Mosley suddenly turned into a neatly built court out of Elliott street and stopped the gig before a genteel looking two-story house painted pea-green. It was a pleasant place with a flower yard in front and vines creeping above the door. `Here is the house we are to live in, dear Ellen,' said Mosley assisting the joyful, trembling girl to alight. He knocked at the door, which was at the same instant opened by an agreeable looking woman to whom he introduced Ellen as his bride. The woman gazed with admiration upon her youth and beauty, welcomed her with respect and ushered them into a hadsomely furnished parlor. Ellen blushed at the term `bride,' he had prematurely used, but it excited no suspicion in her mind. `Now are not these fine rooms, Ellen! This is your parlor and that door leads into as handsome a sleeping room. Now remain here while I go for the clergyman. I shall soon be back; and lest you should repent and run away,' he said playfully, `I shall lock your cage door, pretty bird!' His motive in introducing her already as his wife and for locking the door was that he had also deceived the woman, who had rented the lodgings, as she supposed to a `newly-married pair' —for so he gave her to understand when he engaged them. He did not therefore wish Ellen to have any communication with her while he went to take his gig to the stable. As he went out he, in a low tone, desired the landlady not to disturb `his wife' as she had laid down. In half an hour he returned, and having been lonely and sad in his absence, no sooner did Ellen hear his step than she flew, yet half shrinking back, to meet him. `Where is the clergyman?' she timidly and blushingly inquired, seeing he came alone. `He was out to attend a funeral,' he said with a well assumed look of regret. `I left word for him and he will be here soon. We will take tea, Ellen, and by the time we are through he will certainly be here.' We will not prolong this narrative of a painful story of real occurrence. With one pretence or other he excused the absence of the clergyman, till the hour for preserving her honor after the imprudent step she had taken, had fled forever; and, a victim to her own imprudence, love of flattery and ambition to mate above her degree, the unhappy girl found herself in the power of one who had artfully spread a snare for her ruin. For the first few weeks, by a succession of amusements Mosley succeeded in making her reconciled to her degradation. She, however, at length grew reckless; her modesty of manner departed; while her associates were alone with those of her own condition whom Mosley introduced to his rooms where he held card parties; and in a few months the beautiful and pure Ellen Emery had lost all of her former self but her incomparable beauty. Notwithstanding his base deceptions she blamed her own imprudence, as much as she did Mosley, and had hitherto been indeed as a wife to him, resisting for his sake, tempting proposals of style and equipage from many wealthy young men. Lately there had grown an indifference between them. Mosley became addicted to hard drinking and often treated her rudely. His money too had been expended and he had had to remove her from place to place to the single room he now occupied. Her late demands for money had been met with ill-humor and as he had taught her expensive habits, she felt disappointed and vexed if he did not indulge her. More than once before this morning he had hinted that they had best separate; and her hopes of being made his wife or of changing her fate being long since dissipated, and as her more intimate knowledge of him showed her qualities both of his head and heart which disgusted her, the frail tie which had hound her affections to him, was ready to be loosened so soon as circumstances should call for its severance. She was a girl of a good mind, pleasing and fascinating in conversation and possessed a large share of judgment and observation of character. Mosley respected her, and her influence over him was very great. To supply her with money and load her with presents he had repeatedly been guilty of abstracting funds and goods from his employers; and the failure of the last one with whom he kept was owing to the large amount of goods sent to the auction room through his secret peculations. But now all his means and resources were dried up. He felt that the time had come for him to leave her, as hundreds in her situation had been left, to the current of fortune. While she lay with her face buried in the pillow she, also, felt that the time had indeed come for their separation. She saw that he could no longer supply the wants he had created; while the rent of their room was soon due; and winter was approaching to find neither without money to meet it. Yet to come to this decision was painful and trying. She was attached to Mosley but she had long since discovered that she never had loved him. The separation would be painful, but she resolved that it must be borne. No moral objections intruded upon her thoughts; for though hitherto faithful to him, her mind had been sufficiently corrupted by associating with others of her sex, and by a thorough knowledge of the resources of persons in her situation, to leave her long to hesitate. Nothing is more surprising in the phenomena of character than the sudden and thorough abandonment of the mind of a young girl, however pure it hitherto may have been, when she has once departed from virtue. So profound and innate is the poison of vice that scarcely ever does a woman reform! with her it is all downward till her star of life, which rose in beauty and glory, sets forever in a night of infamy and unrepented guilt! If the pure and guileless girl in humble life, whose beauty promises, like Ellen Emery's, to become a snare to her, could behold the career of a woman lost in her sad course through a life of alternate hollow pleasure and horrid woe, and follow her down to the chambers of death, she would shudder at its contemplation, and turn a deaf ear to the tongue of the flatterer, and shun carefully the companionship of those fine young men whose station in life is above her own—whose notice is infamy. Ellen lay with her face hid till she had decided to leave him and had quite dried up her tears. `Well, Ralph, I think it is best we do separate,' she said with spirit; for she was both grieved and angry at this issue, but yet not sorry that it had occurred. `You seem to be quite willing,' he said, sneeringly. `I suppose you have already settled the matter with some one of your own choice.' `Indeed I have not,' she said with a toss of her pretty head. `I mean to remain here till I decide what to do. My watch will pay my rent.' `I have a plan that I think will please you, Ellen. Now, if you will agree to it, it will be for your good and place you in funds, at the same time, perhaps, give you a good protector.' `What is it?' she asked eagerly. `It is a plan I have been thinking about since day before yesterday. There is quite a handsome young fellow in town, who is clerk in one of the richest dry goods stores in Washington street. He has recently come to the city, is quite unsophisticated, but is ambitious to polish his rusticity. He is too fond of dress, I think, to dress well long upon nothing and I am told his father, though well off gives him no money; he is also, I have discovered, vain of the admiration of young ladies; and though he affects virtue and may, possibly be well enough that way, he is very susceptible and I am greatly mistaken if he will not easily fall into temptation. Now, as I know you will like him, what I propose is that you call at his store, try and get waited on by him, and with such beauty as you possess for bait, I am mistaken, if you play your card well, if you do not have him at your feet, and as much of his employer's money in your purse as you want. He is one of those enthusias tic characters that will go any lengths for the object of his attachment. You will then have a protector and as many fine things as you want. You can too avenge yourself on my sex in teaching to stray an innocent youth, Ellen,' he said laughing. Ellen seemed to reflect a few moments very deeply upon his plan and then said, “He might suspect my — yes, I will out with it, my true character and that would be a bar to future progress at the first step.” “No—you are not known! Your appearance and air, as well as that simplicity of dress you know so well how to assume, are all in your favor. If you, herein, will stand by me fairly, I will not only do you a service but do myself one. I am not in favor with him now, but I will soon be, if you will agree to this. I want money as well as you!” “Has he money?” she asked with a quiet air. “If you can make him bite, I will answer for that. He shan't want for all my own experience in knowing how to replenish his finances—though I am low enough now.” “Well, I agree to it, if after I have seen him I like him,” said the girl, who felt she was now fairly turned upon the tide of her own fortunes, by the desertion and poverty of Mosley; and that unless she wished to sink to the degredation of the most wretched and abject of her class, she must attempt and achieve something for her safety. She therefore entered into the compact with her quondam lover, without compunction, to tempt and plot the ruin of an unsuspecting young man, her plea being to save herself from otherwise destitution. The artful motive and depth of purpose which actuated Mosley will be more fully developed in the progress of the story. Considering himself by this compact now clear from the incubus of a mistress' which to one in his narrow condition was no light burden, he shook Ellen by the hand very cordially and feeling great relief at getting so well rid of an affair the thoughts of which had vexed and perplexed him for several days past. They parted, therefore, after he had given her the name and the place of business of this young victim without much sorrow on either side, but without any feelings of animosity.</field>

A review of the character of our hero—Wentworth and Henry meet—The former apprentice's noble ambition—Its effects upon our hero—The carpenter's rule—Our hero resorts to a weak subterfuge—The beautiful glove purchaser— Our hero captivated by a pair of eyes—His embarrassment—The old lady in spees—A morning scene in the lodgings of a fashionable young man—Mosley and his proposition— Isabel Wentworth meets Stanwood—Her treatment of him—Her two dissolute visitors—Stanwood discovers himself to be half in love—Isabel receives a mysterious note. In delineating the character of Harry Harefoot, we have not been withheld from a desire to make him appear to the reader better and more free from errors than he is, from unfolding all the parts of his character—the good as well as the evil, the weak as well as the noble. We have given it as he brought it with him from beneath his father's hand to enter with its moral capital upon the scenes of life. He is therefore a natural character, and its counterpart may be found varying more or less, as education has variously modified the natural heart in many a city store. We have said that he was in his eighteenth year, tall for his age, handsome in person, with a finely expressive countenance; that he possessed good sense, had genius that promised much, and was uncommonly intelligent, with the possession of conversational powers of a high order; he was warm-hearted; had much of the overflowings of that social sympathy that makes mankind love each other, which is denominated free-heartedness, or `whole-souledness;' that in spite of his fathers characteristic advice for the regulation of his conduct he was strictly honest, had conscientious views of accountability, and still preserved the lovely habit formed by his mother's holy teaching and example of offering up a prayer when he went to bed, and when he rose. We have also said that he had been early spoiled by the smiles of the little village belles, whose admiration had first inspired him with a love for dress, and given him mischievous ideas of the advantages of a fine face and figure; that he was something vain of his person; and a little aristocratic in his notions, having been brought up under the false system which shipwrecked Edward Bentham, and embittered half the life of Charles Blackford; that he aspired in Boston to be a `fine gentleman,' and, to be thought there as handsome and interesting by the ladies as he had been in his native village on the romantic Kennebec. To this analysis we now add that he was romantic, was a great admirer of female beauty; and that his education, the rural character of his former life, as well as an innate delicacy of sentiment, had kept him free from sensuality; although, as we have once painfully shown, he had betrayed the presence of weakness in his character which menaced the bulwarks of virtue. The afternoon of the day in which Ralph Mosley had parted from Ellen Emery, Henry was in his store selling a piece of linen to a customer, when he was surprised to see Pierce Wentworth come in. His first thought, on seeing him, was the suggestion of a guilty conscience; for he believed that he had heard through Mosley or Stanwood, what he had hinted with reference to his sister. He colored with shame and apprehension of a quarrel, and was so disturbed as to lose for a moment his self-possession in replying to a question put by the purchaser of the lace.— Wentworth after discovering him, approached him in a frank, friendly manner, that instantly dispelled his fears; and for once Harry, so relieved was he, shook hands with a mechanic's apprentice more cordially than he ever had done in his life before. The two aprentices had not met but two or three times, and without recognition. If Pierce was surprised to have such a welcome, Harry was delighted to find that he was willing to receive it. He nevertheless felt mortified to look him in the face after what he had said of Isabel. `I have brought into you, Henry,' said Pierce, `a letter from your father, which came with one of mine, and which Parson Pearl brought to the shop. I am glad to hear that all our friends are well. How do you like your new place?' `Very well,' said Henry, taking the letter and thanking him for it. `You I suppose get along well.' `Yes, I am very much pleased. My work is not very hard, though I am kept employed. I have my evenings to myself, and, as I have subscribed to the apprentice's library, I get as many books as I wish. I attend a mathematical school two evenings in the week and a French school every night.' `French!' repeated Harry with surprise, and looking at his townsman's coarse jacket with a slight expression of contempt: `what do you want of French, Wentworth?' `Mr Libby tells me, and I have heard it before that the French language contains many books on architecture that it is important builders should read, and that its best books of mathematics are not translated. So if I master this language it will be of great service to me.' `I suppose you will learn Latin and Greek next,' said Henry scornfully, his customer having left him and given him leisure to converse. `I should like to, I confess,' answered Peirce, not noticing the manner in which he said this: `but I shall at present give my evenings to French and mathematics. Greek I should like very much to study, as in that ancient tongue is locked all the treasures of architecture.' `You look high for a mechanic—a mere apprentice,' said Harry in a tone of contempt with which he meant to rebuke his pretension. `You had best go to college and turn gentleman at once.' `It is not necessary, Harry, to go to college either to become a gentleman or to master the languages and mathematics, if an apprentice has a will and improves his evenings,' answered Peirce mildly. `My present situation is my choice, and yours I think is your choice. My trade calls for great industry to learn its details, and study to master its scientific principles; yours, seem to me, is learned in a day! and you have no occasion to study principles. In choosing a trade I have made up my mind to become not only master of it, but a master in it. I mean to be whatever it holds out to any one to be.— Builders have risen to great men, and I can name, besides many Europeans, our own countrymen, Strickland, Haviland, Davis, and others, who are men of the highest respectability, and their names do honor to the genius of their country.' Harry stared with surprise while he spoke with such warmth and spirit, and could not help feeling respect for the despised apprentices worthy ambition. Nevertheless, he jeeringly said, `I think I have made a mistake, Peirce—and if I wanted to be respectable should have bound myself out to a cobbler instead of being a clerk in a genteel store in Washington street. How much our fathers missed it! You, the hatter's son, should have been here, according to your reasoning, and I, the merchant's son, should be with your master—Libby, I believe, is his name.' `I see we differ, Henry,' said Peirce without betraying any anger; `and all I hope is, that you nor I will either of us be disappointed and fall behind our hopes of being respected in the world. Good morning.' Henry bade him good morning coldly, for he could not help feeling that there was a firmness in the foundation of Wentworth's character his own wanted; and he felt vexed that he should aspire to be `respectable.' It was a presumption in a mechanic's apprentice, and in the son of a mechanic, too glaring to be overlooked or readily forgiven.' `Who was that cove, Harry?' asked Burnham, as Peirce disappeared. `A very respectable young man from Kennebec, who brought me this letter,' answered Henry not wishing to confess that he had an acquaintance that was not `respectable.' `Humph!' ejaculated Ben! `do all you gentry down east carry carpenter's rules stuck in a long pocket adown the thigh?' `You didn't see me?' exclaimed Henry coloring. `I did; a yellow carpenter's hinge-rule, sticking three inches out. He was a carpenter's apprentice, for that was the mark of the beast!' added he, laughing. `I did not know you associated before you came here with such low fellows, Harefoot.' `I guess he was but little higher in his own town,' said Tarfton with a slur; for though he had not forgotten the blow Harry had given him, he was too implacably bitter against him not to dare to show his hatred when opportunity offered. Harry's weakness again betrayed him into folly. To clear himself from the suspicion of not being in `good society' at home, and of associating with mechanics, he preferred to excuse the acquaintance by the most guilty motive for keeping it up; and therefore he said, blushing with self-condemnation while he answered in a light, significant tone, and giving a knowing look—`O, he has a pretty sister, fellows!' This reply, as he well knew, would with them both be considered a good reason for having a low associate; youths of their free way of thinking deeming sensual motives the only plea that could hold good for consorting with persons below their caste. Harry was therefore readily excused; his defence was admitted without a demurrer at the tribunal before which he degraded himself. He felt that the pang he suffered pierced deeper than the mortification of being suspected of not being `respectable' at home. And such is always the result of wrong doing! The evil we resort to, to shun the evil that we fear, proves in the end to have the most poisonous sting. A lie was never uttered by the lips to conceal a lie of the heart or of the heap, that the utterer of it did not in the ultimate issue suffer infinitely more than if the truth had not been hidden. This is the punishment which a wise Providence has appended to every deed of evil. As in the natural world all objects in sunshine cast a shade, so in the moral, all evils, in the light of truth, project their retributive shadow. Vexed with himself at his own weakness, and annoyed that he should, to remove the suspicion of not being respectable, have conveyed to their minds a suspicion of libertinism which he was innocent of, he walked to the richly hung window and looked out through the drapery of silks and lawns, upon the side-walk to divert his mind from himself, for he took no pleasure in his cutting thoughts. He had hardly taken his place there, when his attention was drawn to a young lady richly yet tastefully dressed, who in passing the window stopped to glance at a costly scarf that hung in it. He saw that she was strikingly beautiful, and, while his admiring eyes wandered with the irresistable attraction beauty presents to youth upon her lovely features, as she bent down to get a closer view of the scarf, she lifted her eyes and threw an inquisitive glance through the window. Her fine eyes, soft yet animated, surveyed the interior an instant, and then, ere they were withdrawn, met his. He blushed, his pulse leaped, and a thrill run over the cords of his deepest emotions. She slightly smiled, the slightest in the world, and ere he could recover from the sensation of her beauty, from the fascinating spell of her eyes, and dispel from his soul the witchery of her smile, she had entered the store. As he was nighest to the door, she addressed herself to him, while he dropped his eyes beneath her glance. `Have you gloves, sir?' she inquired, in a voice naturally sweet, but to which an indescribable modulation gave additional charm. `We have, Miss,' he answered, abashed by the bright glances of her eyes, which he felt were examining his face; and without lifting his own, he handed her down the several boxes of French gloves. `These are all too large, I am afraid,' she said, after displaying a white soft hand in contrast with the colors of the gloves she measured by it; `I will, however, take two pairs. Mr. Cushing formerly kept a great variety. But that was before you came, sir, I presume; for I do not recollect seeing you here before.' `I have been here not quite two months,' answered Harry, diffidently. `Mr. Harefoot, is it not?' she asked, smiling, and fixing upon him one of those thrilling glances beneath which his eyes had before sunk. `Yes,' replied Henry, with a look of surprise. `I was not aware I had the happiness of being known to—to' he was going to say to so very beautiful a girl. `O,' she said, laughing, `I have a friend whom I have heard mention you, who has been in here.' Henry would have asked her who she was, but his politenes withheld him, for he felt it would be the same thing as asking who she was herself. Yet he would have given worlds to know. Her beauty had impressed him, susceptible as he was, more than that of any other female he had ever seen. There was a wild spirit combined with a modest demeanor, a frankness of speech, tempered by a downeast look, and a nameless fascination in her air and manner that captivated him. He betrayed too, the effect of her voice and presence by taking the gloves, and putting them into the money drawer, for the two one dollar bills she gave him, and wrapping the bills in a shop-card, and returning them to her with a bow and a blush. She so good-humoredly pointed out the mistake that he could not but feel grateful while he was angry at himself for this betrayal of the effect of her beauty upon him. `Pardon me! You shall keep both gloves and the bills,' he said, forcing back the rolled up notes and placing the gloves in another shop-bill; `for I ought to lose the amount for so ridiculous a blunder!' `O no!' she said, unrolling and placing them in his hand, while he instantly saw the impropriety of presenting, even at his own expense, goods to a stranger, who if a well bred lady, or wished to seem such, would never accept them. Annoyed, therefore, by his own politeness, by which he had meant to atone for his awkwardness, he placed the money in the drawer and gave her the change. She made one or two more purchases with it, and then, a crowd of ladies coming in, she smiled, bowed, and casting upon him an expressive glance of admiration, she left the store. `What do you say, Miss?' `I say,' bawled an old woman, in a black scoopbonnet and iron spectacles, `that I have axed ye these here three times if you want to barter some o' your goods, you got so many on 'em, for some hanks o' nice yarn o' my own and Deb's spinnin'? but you've been so tuck up a looking arter that young gal that ye ha'nt paid me no 'tention.' No; for Harry had seen his fellow-passenger, Mr. George Washington St. John Leighton, pass by as she went out, stop, take this glass and eye her, and then turn and walk the same way she went. `O, marm, I beg your pardon, marm, he said, with a conscious crimsoning of the temples, and wondering if he knew her, and hoping he did not; `what is it you want to get, marm?' `I've got here, I tell ye,' repeated the old lady, impatiently, `four hanks o' blue yarn, I want to barter with ye for some goods. Its gall dyed, and won't smut.' Henry knew that in his own town half the trading was done by barter with the farmers, and he had not been long enough in a fashionable Boston dry goods' store to learn that such a mode of business was not frequently carried on there. So he innocently walked back and asked Mr. Martin if he wanted to barter goods for blue yarn. `Barter goods for blue yarn?' repeated Mr. Jeremiah Martin, opening wide his pop-blue eyes, and putting on an expression of lofty contempt; `where mout you ha' been raised?' Mr. Martin, then, without deigning another word or look, turned away from our mortified and angry hero, with the step and air of Napoleon when retreat from the bridge of Lodi was proposed to him by one of his marshals. Harry went back to the old lady with his pride not a little wounded at having exposed his rusticity, and not a little offended at the first clerk's manner. He dismissed the old lady in the iron spectacles and black scoop with a cross reply, and then bent his yard stick with vexation till it suddenly snapped in his nervous grasp. This restored him to himself, and the rest of the day he was as quiet as thinking about the beautiful glove purchaser would let him be. It was about nine o'clock on the morning of this same day, that a young gentleman in his morning wrapper and slippers was seated at his breakfast in an upper bedchamber of the Exchange Coffee House. The room was large, the bed a handsome French Couch, the windows tall and draped with crimson curtains, bordered with a fringe of gold thread; the furniture rich and piled with books, shell boxes, ivory desks, vases, curious articles of virtu, and all the various melange of a wealthy young man's apartment, confusedly heaped on tables, sofa and chairs. His breakfast was in a large server which was placed on a marble centre table. He was a good looking young man, about twenty-two years of age, inclined to be fleshy, and with a decided air of fashionable dissipation. His cheek was pale, his nose red, his eyes heavy, and his hand as he held his tea cup, nervously shook. He had the preceding year, from comparative indigence and obscurity came into a fortune of a hundred thousand dollars by the death of a relative, and was now spending it in gambling, high living and debanchery. He drove the only horses that ever paced a mile in three minutes over the milldam, and his `turnouts,' whether tandem, span, in single harness, or under the saddle were the talk of the town. He drank deep yet not as a gentleman should, if he drinks at all, at the table, but in every `soda shop,' as bar-rooms were then termed, in town. Never properly educated, his tastes were low, his habits loaferish; his ideas sensual. He was free with his money for the gratification of his own lusts and vanity; and we are sorry to say that many a hitherto moral young man who had come to Boston, to enter upon its scene of industrious application, led astray by foolish deference to money and a weak ambition to associate with a fashionable young man of great fortune, were too willing to become panders to the one, and sycophants to the others; and without sufficient firmness to resist the temptations of the society his companionship led them into, they became as low as he without his notoriety, as sensual without his money. Among those thus that hung upon him was, as may be anticipated, Ralph Mosley. `Well, I wonder what I shall do with myself to-day,' said this fashionable young man, listlessly breaking the large end of a soft boiled egg; `I am getting sick of Boston, and think I must put off to sport awhile in New York. This infernal sober sided city with its narrow streets, I am getting tired of! A fellow can't drive tandem without having his leader always out of sight 'round some twist or other in 'em. Confound my head! how it aches! that's for drinking champagne before I went to bed, with Bob Robertson, and not topping off with brandy, as I always do! Bob has a fine turn-out in his two bay mares and London chair, but don't begin to come to my black Jersies! Give me a Jersey horse for wind and bottom, on a clean turnpike.' Here the rich young man of fashion having dissolved a small lump of butter in his egg, began with a spoon to eat it from the shell as from an egg-cup. At this momont Ralph Mosley was announced as at the bar and desiring to see him. `Ask him up,' he said to the waiter. `There is that bore, Mosley! Come to borrow money I'll swear, and I wouldn't see him if I didn't have the blues so and want company. I can refuse him tho' if I choose. Confound such fellows, they come round a gentleman because he is rich like a parcel of leeches. I verily believe half the fellows about town owe me money I've lent 'em.— They invite me to ride, to a supper, to go to the theatre, and I always have to foot the bill at last. Well there is some gratification in being thought so much of and having so many to admire and look up to one. Well Ralph, my boy, good morning! Glad to see you. Sit down. You see I am just at breakfast. We men of leisure breakfast late you know. I am told some rich fellows in New York don't rise till `leven! Well, how are you? Any news?' `No, not much, Silsby,' answered Mosley; who having stopped on his way from his interview with Ellen Emery, to breakfast at a low restaurant where he still had credit, had just reached Silsby's lodgings. `You look as if you knew something.' `What has become of that pretty Miss—— that you used to board out to Roxbury?' asked Mosley as if not noticing his remark. I saw her riding with Ned Lynch.' `She and I had a little quarrel. She was too extravagant, and last week stole a hundred dollar bill from my waistcoat pocket.' `Who have you now?' `Nobody.' `Who has your handsome rooms in Cambridge street?' `I keep 'em.' `An empty cage is of no use if it is gilded, Silsby.' `I know that! But there is no trusting these persons. I have spent thousands to please them, and they are only the worse for it. I have half a mind to get married, to revenge myself on them all. If I could come across a young beauty, modest and agreeable, I would like to have her. I would give fifty dollars for such a one. I want a fine creature to dash out with on the turnpike.' `Do you mean a wife?' asked Ralph with surprise. `A wife—no!' answered Silsby staring at him. `Then I think I know of one who would just suit you. The fact is you are disgusted with facility and want something to give incentive to perseverance and which shall be enhanced in value in the same proportion that difficulties have been encountered and overcome in the pursuit.' `You have hit me exactly, Mosley!' said the roue with animation. `Who have you in your eye? For that look of yours means something. Come, I am all curiosity.' `I know a young girl just from the country, Boh,' said Mosley, in a quiet tone, `who is very beautiful, is innocent as a lamb, and unsophisti cated as a nun. She has been in town two months.' `Who is she—where is she?' demanded Silsby laying down his spoon. `Do you know her? If you do I wouldn't trust her.' `No. But I can get you an introduction to her.' `Do it, Mosley, and I will give you five dollars.' `You said just now fifty.' `If I won her. Besides you owe me forty dollars now.' `This pretty milliner is worth a hundred. She can easily be won by your address, equipage, presents and wealth. You will dazzle and blind her. Give me a quittance for the forty dollars and give me a cool fifty, Bob, and I will do the thing.' `Bless me! do you think I am made of money. I have spent twenty thousand dollars already of my fortune. When I get it down to fifty I mean to stop, marry and settle down. Well, I'll do it, provided you show her to me and I like her looks.' `Done, replied Mosley rising. Come with me.' Silsby delayed sometime to dress, much to the vexation of Mosley who was impatient to get the money to be earned by becoming pandor to his vices. Isabel Wentworth was seated in the little recess curtained off from the shop, part of Mrs. Prescott's millinary establishment, trimming with great taste a straw hat. She had that morning got a letter from home which old Parson Pearl had brought to her. The news was pleasant, and with the consciousness that she was doing her duty where her father had placed her, she felt happy and was singing, for Mrs. Prescott had gone down into Kilby street to purchase some bonnet silks and the apprentices were in the back sitting room at work. Isabel, therefore was shop-keeper. At intervals she would lift her eyes from the bonnet and glance out into the street at the hurrying passers-by; but they did not fix her attention long, for by this time she had become quite accustomed to the noise and bustle of the city. In taking one of these glances, she was surprised to see Frank Stanwood pass with a very respectable middle aged lady leaning on his arm, while he seemed to escort her with great tenderness and respect. A glow came roseate to her cheeks while a pang at the recollection of what Harry had said and which she had referred to Stanwood instead of Mosley, shot to her heart. To add to her confusion and the tremor of her heart, they had scarcely passed by before they came back and entered the shop. Laying down the half-trimmed hat she rose up, and with a cheek in which the carnation struggled with the lilly, approached them behind the counter. Stanwood's return to this shop after passing it by was plainly accident, if an opinion might be formed from his start of surprise and mantling glow of pleasure on seeing her make her appearance to wait on them. He half-bowed, but instantly recovering herself, reflecting that his thinking of her ever since he first saw her had not made him acquainted, and that he was to her a perfect stranger! She looked too, like wishing to avoid his glance and her manner was reserved. `Mother,' he said, glancing around, yet observing her, `you can cortainly find sister Mary a bonnet here. They are numerous and all appear in such good taste! Did you make this, Miss?' he inquired, wishing to hear her speak and prepared to catch the tones that he had once thought so touching. `No, sir,' she answered reservedly. `It is very pretty.' Isabel made no answer; fearing to encourage any conversation after the character she believed he possessed. Poor Isabel her heart was open to all gentle influences from the source to which she so firmly closed its avenues; and while she could not hide from herself the interest she felt in him, she resolutely made up her mind not to have any thing to do with him. Stanwood was not long in finding out that she was unnaturally constrained in his presence, and sought in vain in himself for the cause. She was free, frank and interesting as he had first seen her, when she conversed with him about the bonnets; but a word from him caused an expression to pass across her sunny face like a cloud. Hurt and surprised at this, he turned and stood by the door till the purchase was made by his mother, when coldly bowing he left the shop. On the side-walk he parted with his mother to go to his store. He had gone but a few paces and was crossing the flag-stones at the head of Summer street when he was turned back to the walk by a dashing buggy rapidly driven by a young blood in whom he recognized as he whirled by, Bob Silsby and seated by his side Ralph Mosley. He turned round to look after them when he saw them the next moment draw up along the curb-stone before the shop in which the beautiful apprentice kept. He saw Mosley alight and enter. His heart throbbed like a trip-hammer with the rush of painful sensations this sight caused him. He did not know till then, how deep was the interest he took in that fair girl. He smiled mentally at his own romantic enthusiasm, and turned and walked back, resolving, if peril threatened her as he believed, from such a source, to caution, and if need were, to protect and defend her. In a steady and by no means visionary young gentleman, like Francis Stanwood, this was a novel determination. But his heart was interested in her, and his feelings were his heart's warm and generous impulses.— The interest she awakened was by no means selfish or dishonorable to the pure object of it.— Dishonor was known to this high-minded youth only by name. He was the model of integrity and moral uprightness. His life had been without a stain. The son of an episcopal clergyman, of an adjacent town, he had been educated for the world to come, as well as rightly to perform the duties of the world present. Religious principle, love of truth, disgust of vice, and emulation after purity of heart and life had been early instilled into his mind by both of his judicious Christian parents; and under their fostering charge he grew up to his eighteenth year a fine, noble, worthy and universally beloved young man. Too poor to be educated at College, Mr. Cushing, who was a relative of his mother, proposed taking him into his store, where at the time of our story he had been little more than a year, possessing the entire confidence of his employer. It was with anxious solicitude that he walked back towards the shop to observe their conduct. Mosley remained in but a moment when coming out, Silsby alighted and both went in together. `Here is villainy, and I must defeat it,' said Frank, resolutely. `That Mosley was in the store and saw her the day I did, and has by some means sought her out. Possibly it may be accident as my seeing her was, and fortunate I am in making the happy discovery! I would have asked Harry Harefoot but that, from what insight I have got into his character, he might be inclined to misinterpret my motives. Of their motives there can be no question. To what dangers is innocence exposed in a large city. I will enter and frame a question about the bonnet my mother purchased! No they will then, I fear, (for he who is evil evil thinks) think I visit her for the object they can alone have in view; and lest I be a means of casting the least reflection upon the rectitude of her character, I will stand here within the door of this apothecary's and observe them. Isabel had just resumed her seat and taken up her bonnet to complete the trimming, when Mosley came in. Not having noticed him in Mr. Cushing's store, she did not now recognize him. She rose to attend to his wishes approaching with a quiet, charming dignity that became her. Mosley gazed upon her sweet face and whatever he meant to say he could not utter, but stood abashed and silent in the presence of her innocent beauty. `Did you wish any thing, sir?' she modestly asked. `Eh, no! That is, my friend does, I believe— I will ask him,' and thus awkwardly replying he left the shop and approached the buggy. `She is there behind the counter! Go in and ask for a ribbon, or price a Tuscan,' he said hurriedly; `that boy will hold the horse.' Silsby entered with him, and after staring at her broadly, with his eye-glass, he approached her, and said in an insinuating tone, `Foin day, Miss,' `Yes,' said Isabel, so respectfully that it chilled him. `Have you any gentlemen's Leghorns, my dear?' he asked, more boldly. `No, sir,' was the brief reply of the maiden. `Don't pout, my pretty one,' said Silsby, smiling, and playfully tapping her waist across the counter with the top of his riding whip. `You have seen her—let us go!' said Mosley, who saw the impatient Stanwood at the moment pass the door and look steadfastly in. Mosley drew him out to his buggy, the roue kissing his hand to her as he left the shop, and afterwards when he got into his carriage. `What do you think of her?' asked Mosley, as they turned up Winter street, both nodding to Stanwood as they passed. `She is a hebe—a perfect gipsey!' `Then you like her,' said Mosley, with a smile. `Yes! She is spirited though, and took offence at my calling her dear! But her part became her! What a fine eye and pencilled brows! See how my mare carries her head!' `And did you ever see such a mouth and lips! Your mare is hard on the bit this morning, Silsby!' `Never! Her shoulders have such a graceful fall, and her voice is the sweetest I ever heard! Wo! that confounded terrier's barking has startled her. I will soon break her in!' `Yes, she is a little shy now! but your gig and style will captivate her. `Oh, the milliner? Yes! I will see what I can do there. You did'nt introduce me! I must be introduced she is so shy.' `Give me the fifty and I'll not only do that but insure you success in getting her to ride out with you. Once drive her out of town and you are safe.' `Well, there's fifty!' said Silsby, taking a bank bill from his wallet and giving it to him. `If I do not fail I never will ask you for the forty I have loaned you. Where shall we drive! Suppose we take the Neck out to Fresh Pond, and come in by the Dam.' For Silsby to wish was for Mosley to acquiesce. The drive was taken, and they returned in time for Mosley to pay O'Bruce halfof his bill, with which he was for the present content, and to get to Ellen's room a few minutes after she had returned from Mr. Cushing's store. She expressed herself highly pleased with her victim, was charmed with his rustic diffidence, and triumphed in having made such a deep impression as she felt she had done. She declared herself not only delighted at the prospect of the adventure, but sanguine of success, of which Mosley, now that she had entered for the prize, began to express his doubts. Isabel had been reseated but a few minutes at her work, her cheek burning with offence at the insolent freedom of her visitor, when a lad came in, and asking her if her name was Miss Wentworth, handed her an unsealed note and left. She opened it and read, written in pencil as follows: `If Miss Wentworth is desirous of preserving her reputation spotless she is cautioned by one, who, though unknown, to her feels the deepest interest in her welfare, to beware of two fashionable young men who have but a few moments since quit her shop.' Isabel read the billet with surprise, and alarmed at she knew not what danger, she burst into tears, and sighed for the peace and protection of her mother's home. Mrs. Prescott at that moment coming in, she restrained her emotion, and thrusting the note into her bosom, resumed her employment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. The Mall at twilight—City scenes and suburban scenery—A new character introduced—Washington Gardens—The poet and his audience—Lynch quits Mosley—Stanwood and his visiter—Tribute to a Boston Merchant—Harry's letter from his mother—Maternal advice—Lynch introduced to our hero—Harry is pleased with him—They walk homewards in company—Harry's first temptation. About sunset on the day of the occurrence of the events narrated in the preceding chapter, two young men fashionably attired were promenading the mall. Hundreds of citizens, from the gray-headed old man who remembered the majestic elms that over-shadow his path, when they were saplings, to the bounding school-girl with her hoop, and the urchin with his bat and ball, were thronging the magnificent park to enjoy the beauty of the twilight hour. Some were slowly walking up and down the gravelled walks engaged in earnest conversation; others were seated on the benches watching the groups of passers-by; others, who seemed strangers were admiring as they walked, the majestic height and forest-like grandeur of the noble avenues, the gothic-like arching over head of the lofty arms of the expanding trees, the undulatory surface of changing green the Common presented to the eye, intersected by natural paths filled with passengers moving in every direction; others were looking with awe and admiration at the majestic monarch-elm, in its midst, beneath which the children of Boston of the fifth and sixth generations have played, upon the distant suburban scenery of hill and dale, village, church and villa, with the blue outline of pleasant hills beyond, below which the sun was sinking upon a couch of gold and purple clouds. Others loving art rather than nature, or sated with her treasures so freely poured into the lap of taste, were gazing upon the long and graceful range forming `colonade row,' with its balconies graced with vases of flowers and groups of beautiful ladies; upon the columnar spire of the Park street church; the gothic elegance of the Temple; upon that grand and imposing series of palaces which form so noble a termination to the mall on Beacon street; and upon the imperial pile of column, terrace and crowning dome, towering with majesty and power over all—the throne of art ruling the empire at her feet which she has won from nature. In the midst of this fair scene, throbbed many a human bosom, incapable from too much anxious care about the world's goods, or from sorrow, or from evil passions and a wicked and corrupt heart, to enjoy what benevolent nature and the perfection of man's taste and the opulence of art had heaped around them—an inexhaustible store of riches both for the heart and mind. The heart of the bad man, is, to such gifts, of all hearts the most insensible! The soft hues of the evening cloud, the pleasing green of the fields, the singing of birds, the voices of children, the whole harmony of moral and physical nature are painful to his contemplation. Vice has put sadly out of tune the chords which should sound in sweet unison with every touch of nature. All is moral discord in his bosom, all is intellectual deformity in his mind. The perfection of nature is hateful to him as it is a light that exposes to him the imperfection within. He feels no sympathy with the bright, the gentle, the beautiful and the happy, for they are witnesses against him. To have the heart open to the sweet influences of nature, to feel her voice, her beauty and at all times to be alive to her teachings, to have the harp of the soul ever responsive to her touch, are proofs of a heart yet uncontaminated by vice, yet in unison with the good, the beautiful and the happy. The minds of the two young men introduced in the opening of this chapter were dimmed by vice and no longer reflected the fair forms of nature. They walked along insensible to the beauty of the hour, indifferent to the loveliness of the scene spread around them. Their conversation was like their propensities, `worldly, sensual, devilish.' They were there to gaze upon the face of modesty with a stare of licentious admiration, to meet others of either sex with spirits of kindred with their own; to plan the ruin of the upright and rejoice in the contemplated fall of the victim. Yet neither of these young men had reached the age of maturity. Both had been morally educated, and lessons of religion had been inculcated upon them from childhood. The secret of their moral ship-wreck lies in the false pride of their friends who despising trades for them, in which condition their habits would be less likely to be corrupted by aping fashion, dress and high life, and when their time would be wholly employed and their conduct under the supervision of watchful masters, had placed them, to make them `respectable' in the most dangerous place for a young man, in a store in a large city, where they were under no moral or other control, where they had their earnings to themselves, where they were tempted to indulge in every folly and amusement as necessary and belonging to their `condition,' and where the road to ruin is broad as vice and as downward as indulgence can make it! They were Ralph Mosley and his friend Ned Lynch; a clerk in an importing store in Kilby street, and a purloiner of goods to convert into money to support his extravagancies, Lynch was a native of Portland and the son of a respectable Jeweller. But being educated above his father's profession, he came to Boston to enter as a clerk. His habits when he first came had been good; but first tempted to go out evenings, he was insensibly led to drink, to the theatre, and ultimately to more disreputable haunts till losing his self-respect, he gave himself up to a free course of dissipation. He, like Mosley, was quite out of funds, and as he feared his employer suspected him and that he was watched, he had some weeks feared to abstract any thing. Consequently his finances needed replenishing. To him Mosley was now communicating his designs respecting Henry Harefoot, whom he represented as likely to yield to the temptation set for him; in which case he would have to draw money; that once induced him to purloin, his situation in one of the most extensive dry goods stores in the city would give him opportunity, if he was wary, of embezzling large sums by which they could both profit so long as he was undiscovered. `Now, what I propose is this,' said Mosley, as arm in arm they approached the opening from the mall, opposite Winter street, `that you who know Frank Stanwood very well, go down now and see him and manage to get him to introduce you to Harefoot. He and Stanwood are cronies, and he will readily give his confidence to any one he introduces. You will then—(There goes a pretty girl! what a pretty step!) you will leave and linger about the store till he shuts up and pro pose to walk. Bring him to the Washington Gardens where I will meet you as if by accident. (Did you see that smile! What eyes! But she's respectable!) If we can get him there and once get him to drink he's our's, for he will then fear to cut me as he now does. There go two fine women, but they are not game!' Thus with villany in his heart and lust in his wandering glances did this depraved young man walk discoursing—the seren heavens above him; lovely scenes spread around him, and the holy twilight influence wooing his soul to tenderness. They then crossed the street to a high board fence, half overhung with foliage, having a gateway in it, over which was placed an arched sign with the words, `Washington Gardens' painted thereon. A man was just lighting a lamp above the gate as they entered. Within the attendants were lighting numerous colored lamps arranged in fanciful forms in different parts of the garden, through which run several walks terminating in alcoves. Without heeding the garden portion of the enclosure, the two young men entered a large room on the left, adorned with paintings of hunts, nymphs bathing, race horses and hounds, game and engravings of less pure description. On one side of this apartment which was already well lighted was a bar, with its dazzling display of ruby-hued decanters, its tiers of glittering glass, and its polished soda fountain. The floor was sanded and contained many chairs, three sofas and half a dozen tables, on some of which were newspapers, on others recently emptied glasses, and around others young men were drinking and conversing, while the incence of tobacco smoke ascended in clouds to the god Bacchus, who was there worshipped. `What'll you take take, Lynch?' asked Mosley taking out his pocket book and ostentatiously displaying a roll of money—the wages of his guilty subserviency to the passions of Silsby `A soda-brandy! I haven't had any tea, and this is as good for me. Do you know I don't have any appetite for eating—I don't know how it is—but one or two glasses does me as much good as a dinner;' `It is so with me,' answered Mosley. I don't like any thing but an oyster fry and then I have to prime for it with a three quarter brandy or gin bitters. I'll take a gin-bitter now, Jim,' he added to the bar-keeper. The young men then drank; Mosley offered a ten dollar bill in pay, and as he suspected, rather than change it they trusted him. It is true he had silver in his pocket but that was his own secret. Lynch then left him and Mosley joined a group of young men at the end of the room who were making themselves very merry and showing their own wit by teasing a poor crazy poet, whom they had got half tipsy, and who at such times imagined himself to be Byron. Like him he wore a wide shirt collar—but Byron's was clean and was linen—turned broadly over his collar, and had a red bandanna handkerchief knotted in front, and the ends hanging down to his waist. He was dressed in a gray roundabout with a patch in each elbow and other places that equally required patches. His pantaloons were thin linen and had once been white and tightly fitted his thin legs, which were terminated by feet cased in black short hose, and faded green slippers. He was familiarly called `Lord Byron,' though his real name was Everett C—. He had been a student at Cambridge and evinced while there, poetic genius of a very elevated rank. But he became dissipated in his Junior year, and excess destroyed the fine fabric of his brain, and he fell forever from the high intellectual seat he had aimed for, and became the wreck of mind he now was. `Recite the verses on Quincy Pond,' asked one of the crowd of young men. `Yes, Byron,' repeated the rest, with animation. `Give us the verses.' `Let me have a place to stand on, gentlemen,' said the poet in a loud tone: `I must be above the groveling herd Nor sink my dignity to the level with the mass. Genius is god-like and as gods do sit on thrones, So I must stand upon this barrel, this Bottle which erst did nectar hold, my sceptre And — but I'll begin.' Here the poet threw out one arm and holding a piece of dirty looking paper before him, thus begun, his high bold intellectual forehead, his noble and finely cut features, commanding respect while his actions and words excited mirth and ridicule. `Know, all present, that the Mayor is my patron. For creating beauty out of deformity, he has been blackguarded by the press for spending the city's money. But the time will come when that pond, which they do call contemptuously `Quincy Lake,' shall be the ornament to the Common, as dear to the boys of Boston as the old Elm our forefathers planted there.' `We don't want a speech but a poem,' cried the audience, each one of whom either had a cigar in his mouth or a glass of liquor in his hand, and were crowded round him uproariously; a fitting scene for fathers to intrude upon—a scene over which humanity might sigh with shame! We will not add to the degredation of mind by giving the verses which he recited; which once burned with the fire of pure genius, were now a chaos of mad ideas. The drunkard may find amusement in such exhibitions of a fallen intelligence for such is allied to his own voluntary degredation; but a man will never express other than emotions of pity and painful sympathy for the misfortunes of those whom God has so fearfully smitten. The light of mind is kindled at the altar of the eternal intellect, and the mind that can find pleasure in seeing it extinguished in another must itself be dark indeed. When he had ended his extravagant production, and the shouts of applause had subsided, Mosley handed him a glass of brandy and called upon him for a song; but before he could begin, another made him swallow a glass of whiskey in which he had humorously sprinkled Cayenne pepper; to destroy the painful effects of this another persuaded him to quaff off a gin cocktail The poor poet notwithstanding all this tried to sing, and thus began: `It chanced one lovely day in June,' But with the last word in the line his head sank upon his breast and he tumbled off the barrel upon the floor amid the laughter of all round, who no doubt thought it a clever joke to get a crazy man drunk, and then see him fall and endanger his neck. Fearful indeed was the punishment of Everett C—for his youthful intemperance. In his fate was foreshadowed that of those who now made sport of him for their end has been either insanity or that more fearful madness mania potu. But these scenes took place in years past, when Intemperance was our fire-side companion; when the Circean cup was at the lip of the young and the old, of the noble and the gifled! Ere the mask was torn from her hideous visage and like the unveiled prophet Mokanna, her visage of death exposed in all its horrid truth! Such a scene of a dozen or twenty young clerks, congregated within a public garden in the heart of the city, openly drinking, revelling, and baiting a maniac, could not in this day of moral improvement occur, though Boston has nearly doubled her population. Intemperance is now banished to the dens and holes of infamy, and it is now shame for a young man or an old man or any man who would not be the suicide of his own character in the eyes of his fellow men, to be seen or to be known drinking, and why? Intemperance is now a crime! The congress of human opinion has enacted a great moral law which solemnly declares it such! The extraordinary progress of temperance which has produced such wonderful results, is one of those great moral eras of our race, for its amelioration, which occur at their seasons. The invention of the compass was one; that of printing another; then followed the reformation; the American Revolution; the invention of steam; then blazed the spirit of evangelizing the heathen; and others of later date have followed. The wheels of temperance roll on and men guide it, but there is an unseen power that has set its wheels in motion. Father Matthew was but an instrument in the same Almighty hand which is now plainly working out for mankind a higher and nobler destiny than the world has yet conceived of. The dissipated frequenters of `the Gardens,' after having with indifference seen the pitiable object of their late amusement carried out as if he had been a dog, to be cast into the street, separated in knots, each seeking some rendezvous of pleasure. Mosley did not join them, though the money which he displayed made his company very much coveted. He lounged into the garden, and with a cigar in his mouth took a seat on a bench to wait for Lynch. This young man took his way to Mr. Cushing's store which he entered as Harry just finished lighting up, in which he had been assisted by a younger clerk who had that afternoon came in place of Burnham, who had been dismissed for taking a quarter of a dollar from the draw to buy a circus ticket the night before, and for denying both the theft and also having been to the circus, on beiag accused of it by Mr. Cushing. Henry was not a little gratified to have one below him, although he was but a lad, being not quite fifteen. Stanwood was reading at the farther end of the store when Edward Lynch entered. Harry glanced up from a letter which he took out from his pocket to read on fin shing lighting the store, and seeing a slender young man in a dandyish green coat, buff vest, and white bell-top beaver hat, swinging a cane round by its silken tassel, he gave his attention again to the letter, there being no customers in to be attended to. `Ah, Frank, how are ye?' said Lynch, going up to him and clapping his hand on his shoulder! `Always reading! What you got there?— `Athenaeum Library' stamped on it, too! Do you get books there? I went there once with Bob Silsby to see some naked figures of goddesses, but was disappointed in 'em! `Marshall's Life of Washington!' How can you read such big bores? The day I left school under old master Cushman, I gave books the go-by? Well, how are you? I hav'nt seen you for an age!' `O, quite well, Ned,' said Stanwood, laughing at him; `but you look pale? I hope I don't hear true stories about you Ned,' added Frank in a kind friendly tone. `What stories?' asked Lynch, who much wished to share the esteem and confidence of Stanwood, whose firmness and integrity of character he admired, though he could not have the moral strength to imitate it. `I heard Burnham say, in excuse for going, that he saw you at the circus last night, and that you were flushed with wine, and had a female on your arm, whom he said he knew to be a girl of the town.' `Where is the fellow?' `Mr. Cushing has dismissed him.' `The little lying rouge! by blacking my character, he hoped te whitewash his own,' said Lynch, angrily. `I have not been in the circus, Stanwood, since it opened, nor have I spoken to a woman for a week, except my washerwoman.' `Well, I am glad to hear it! If Mr. Rice should hear of such things he would dismiss you, and then, as your reference would have to be to him as the last place you kept in, I fear you would not get employment again.' `I should be sorry to have him. He is a noble and generous man, and treats all his clerks kindly, yet with dignity, so that we feel that we are not only in the employ of a gentleman, but are treated by him ourselves as such. He is not stern, like many other merchants, to those under him, but so conciliates them as to command their respect and win their attachment. I have never heard of one, and there are many merchants in this city that have been educated to business under him, who does not speak of him in the highest terms of affectionate respect.' `I am glad to hear you say this of him, as he has recently given me an invitation to take Freeman's place, who is going into business for himself.' `What, the second clerk?' repeated Lynch, with incredulous surprise. `Yes,' answered Stanwood, smiling; `he first asked Mr. Cushing, who referred him to me.' `And of course you take the berth. It is three moves above me. But you are worthy, of it, though Henry Rice's store is the first in Boston. You are a lucky fellow.' Lynch might have said, instead of `lucky fellow,' a `deserving, trust-worthy, and intelligent young man of business,' and he would have spoken the truth. `Who takes your place? I should like it.' `It will be offered to Henry Harefoot, a clerk we have had but a couple of months, but who is very well qualified to fill it. Mr. Cushing has the utmost confidence in him.' `He should have, for you are the one that attends to the bank business, are you not, Stanwood?' asked or rather remarked Lynch, while his pulse beat quicker and his eyes sparkled. `Yes. But I am not certain I shall accept Mr. Rice's offer, though it is liberal; and I am told it's pleasanter keeping in an importing house than in a retail store.' `Yes, and much more respectable. We consider retail clerks as beneath us! though there are good fellows among them. By the by, I should like to know this Harefoot; will you introduce me?' `Certainly,' answered Frank, walking immediately to the front of the store, where Harry sat upon the window-sill, reading the letter he had before taken from his pocket. It was from his mother, and the same Pierce Wentworth had brought to him that day. He had read it twice already, and was now with visible emotion perusing it for the third time. It was as follows: Augusta, Kennebec County, State of Maine, October 28, 182- My Dear Son Harry,—Your last letter gave us all at home a great deal of joy. I was gratified at your affectionate remembrance of me in sending the pretty cap, and I gave your love to little Emma Cutter, as you desired. She is knitting for you a purse she wants me to send you with our first package. I am happy to find you are so well pleased with your place, my son, and that Mr. Cushing is so well satisfied with you. You have only now, my dear boy, to do your duty to be respected. Never consider any thing beneath you which you are required by Mr. Cushing or the upper clerks to perform. Pride has ruined many young men who set out in life as prosperously as you have. Try and cultivate a kind demeanor, pleasing manners, and a frank and unsuspicious bearing; but as true politeness proceeds from grace in the heart, you must first cultivate that. Do not omit reading in the little Bible I wrote your name in, once a day, nor never neglect committing yourself in prayer to your heavenly Father when you go to bed nor thanking Him in grateful adoration when you rise up. Seek humbly his guidance through the day, and you will have it. There is no real good or true happiness that does not first originate in duty to our Maker. Avoid profane speech, impure language, and telling impure anecdotes, for they corrupt the heart. Spend your evenings at home in reading or writing, and your Sabbaths in the fear of God, going twice to church. Never break the Sabbath on any pretence! Let it be a holy day to you through life. Avoid the society of all young men whose character you do not know to be good; but it is best to have few companions and but one or two friends. Have no desire to go to the play, to parties, to frolies, and other scenes of temptation, and never without permission from Mr. Cushing, who is now to be in our place to you. Above all, my son, never touch a drop of wine. O that I could impress, as with a seal, this caution upon your heart—engraft it upon your mind. The sword has slain its thousands, but wine its tens of thousands. You must bear with me, Henry, for giving you such a grave letter of advice, but I have your welfare closely united to my heart, and I know that you are surrounded with temptations, and that you need not only a mother's love, but God's arm to guard and detend you. One thing more, Henry. You have, I know, a fondness for the society and admiration of young ladies. This at home in our quiet village was, perhaps well enough, as it improves the manners of youths to associate early in life with respectable young females. But in Boston there are, I blush to say, classes of females here unknown, who, with lovely countenances, and wearing alluring smiles, are dangerous for young men to know. `Their house,' saith the seventh of Proverbs. where she is described, `is the way to hell, going down to the chamber of death. Let not thine heart incline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. For she hath cast down many wounded; yea, many strong men have been slain by her.' Never, therefore, Henry, form any acquaintance with any young woman whose family or friends you do not know; no matter if she rustles in silks and glitters in laces, has the smile of Hebe and the beauty of a Helen. This is the last of the advice, dear Henry, I have to give you. I hope you will never have to repent the not keeping it. If a mother's prayers can be a shield and buckler to your head, you will not be left exposed, ungarded, my dear child, to the snares of this wicked world. If you want your shirts mended, or any thing of yours fixed nicely, send the things home in a bundle by Mr. Pearl, when he comes down in the sloop. The good old black made my heart glad yesterday when he told me he saw you in Washington street only last week, and said you were looking so handsome, and so well, and `like a born gemman, ebery inch o' him, mistress,' were Pearl's words. Your father and brothers and sisters send their love. Now good bye, my son, and write as often as you can. I have only left room to write—`Your affectionate mother, Anna. Henry had finished the letter, and was looking at it with moistened eyes when he saw Stanwood approaching. Hastily putting it up and forcing back the tears to their ungated fountains he met him with a smile. `A love-letter, eh?' said Frank, playfully.— `Henry, let me make you acquainted with Mr. Lynch, whom his friends call Ned Lynch; a very nice young gentleman, I believe, though a little wild, hey, Ned?' Lynch laughed, shook Henry cordially by the hand, and entered into conversation with him while Stanwood went back and resumed his book. Harry was insensibly pleased with his ease of manner, prepossessing address and graceful facility in conversation, which was humorous, and calculated to please where the effort to please was made. Lynch remained until eight o'clock struck, and they begun to shut up, by which time the two young gentlemen had got upon quite a social and familiar footing. The introduction and the friendly manner of it, forestalled all question in Henry's mind as to the correctness of character of his new acquaintance whom he thought the most interesting and entertaining young man he had ever seen. As the youngest lad, whose name was Walter Berry, was too small to shut up alone, Henry waited to assist him in closing the windows, and also to take the key after Stanwood locked the door, it being Mr. Cushing's rule that the first or the second clerk should himself see the store locked up and the key given by him to the one who was to open it. In Martin's absence, Stanwood now took the responsibility, and handed the key to Harry, who was still to open, though he had now bidden adieu to `lamps and bundles.' Stanwood parted from them at the door, and with the small store trunk of bank notes (safes being little known then) in his hand, took the way to a bank which kept a private door open till nine, for such deposits of merchants, while Henry walked towards his own lodgings, which he usually reached by first turning up Bromfield lane, and then through the mall, a walk always delightful to him. `Where do you spend the evening after taking the key home, Harefoot?' asked Lynch, familiarly putting his arm through his, and catching pace with him. `I shall stay at home and read.' `What a literary set you are at Mr. Cushings! Stanwood is always poring over some dull book written by men long since dead, and so are not worth reading.' `I was not aware that the fact of an author's being dead had an effect upon his books,' said Henry laughing. `Why, I'd just as soon think of reading last year's newspaper. But all books are bores, and reading is dull business. It is hard for me to get through a letter. Baker makes me read invoices sometimes, and that is as dull as book-reading. `I should think it might be,' remarked Henry, with a smile at the half-earnest, half-jesting tone of his companion. `But here is Bromfield's lane, where I turn up.' `So do I,' said Lynch, readily, for it was just the way he wished to go. Reaching Tremont street, Henry turned down, and, when opposite Park street church, was about to cross to the head of the mall to enter the avenue, when Lynch slightly detained him by the arm, saying carelessly— `Come, let us take this side; it is lighted, and is pleasanter than the dark shade of the trees. On that side, a block below, were the Washington Gardens.' As they approached the entrance they saw a brilliant light above it, a crowd gathered round, and ladies and gentlemen going in and out, while from within came floating the stirring notes of instrumental music. `Were you ever in the `Washington Gardens?' inquired Lynch, stopping him as they came under the lamp; `it is a pleasant place and all strangers visit it.' `No; but I am told it is not very respectable,' answered Harry. `That is a mistake. It is frequented by the best people. See through the door the ladies and gentlemen promenading the walks? Let me take you in.' `I would rather not; especially as I have the store-key with me, and might lose it.' `Stand it up in your vest pocket and button your coat, if you fear that. But there is no danger. I will then walk home with you. I want to see a friend who probably is in here.' `I will wait here, said Henry, with a hesitating manner. `How precise you are! Do you think I would ask you to go where it was improper. Frank Stanwood has been here with me a hundred times, to take an ice-cream or a glass of soda,' said the young man, resorting to what he knew to be false. `Come, let us go in for a moment. I want you to see what a fine place it is. `Ashamed to be thought too precise, and afraid his new friend would think he had no manner of confidence in him, he consented, and entered, Lynch paying the door keeper a quarter of a dollar for two tickets, which were to be taken in exchange within for refreshments. This was the first time Harry had ever been in a public garden. The novel display struck him for a few moments with admiration. The main avenue before him was terminated by a vast mirror, which reflected its length, creating a delusive avenue, extending to the deceived eye far in the distance, Walks penetrated the garden in all directions, adorned with columns of variegated lamps, transparent paintings in fresco, and vases of flowering plants. Ladies and gentlemen were wandering in all directions, a band in an elevated orchestra was playing a lively air, and all was gaiety, life and novelty. To the eye and imagination of Harry it was a fairy scene; he had never seen a public garden by daylight, nor a stage behind the scenes, or he might have tempered his imagination by the memory of such things'— Lynch saw the effect produced upon his mind, and said— `Now, Harefoot, is not this a fine place? Are you not glad you came with me?' `I confess I am,' answered Henry, with enthusiasm. `I had no idea it was such a place.' `Come with me; I will show you about.' Guided by him, he traversed the walks, admired the paintings and lamps, glanced into the boxes where in soft shadow many a couple was seated tcte-a-tcte, eating ices or confectionary. They then came back to the head of the garden, Harry observing in his walk that the `ladies' were mostly young girls, and the `gentlemen' clerks and other young fellows; and that, save a stranger, or country gentleman or two with wife and daughters, there were present no very refined people.— At the head of the garden stood the dwelling, its front open to the promenades, with an awning projecting over a spacious floor. Here was the bar, and hither Lynch, seeing Mosley there, now led Harefoot. The crowd of young men, smoking, drinking, and talking loud, the bustle of waiting boys, numbered with labels on their shoulders, running to and fro with little salvers of ices and other refreshments for those in the garden boxes, the calls for various liquors, and the eternal cloud of tobacco smoke, in which vice, it would seem, fain would hide itself, were bewildering and new to him. Before he could have time to reflect, Lynch had drawn him up to the bar, Mosley and he having exchanged glances. `Here, barkeeper—Jim—why don't you wait on us?' called Lynch, peremptorily, and holding up his ticket. `What'll you have, gentlemen?' inquired Jim, catching up two tumblers, and balancing them in his open palm, while he waited their decision. `What will you take, Harefoot?' `Nothing, I thank you,' replied Henry, shrinking back. `Poh, poh! Don't be so squeamish! Take something!' said Ned, in off-hand way. `We shall dub you Parson Primitive.' `I never drink,' replied Henry, coloring. `Then it's time. All young men of any spirit drink wine, man. These tickets must not be thrown away. They pass for money here Stanwood didn't tell me you were a Methodist.' The idea of being thought singular, and of being so upright as to be suspected of being a Christian of an humble and zealous persuasion, caused him to blush as if he had been accused of being a thief. It was fear that sent the conscious blood from his heart to his cheek, and made him ashamed of his own temperance in the face of the wicked. Lynch saw the advantage he had gained, and pressed his entreaty. `Well, Lynch,' said Harry, laughing to hide his compunction at consenting to what he ought not to do, and wishing to remove from his new friend the impression he had formed of the primitiveness of his character; `I will take a little Annis cordial.' `And won't you take a sugar-plum in it?' asked Lynch, laughing. `Well, cordial it is. Jim give us some Annis-cordial, and I will take—take —yes—I believe a port wine sangeree.' `What's a sangaree?' asked Harefoot. `A capital drink, and healthy. Try one!— Cordial is fit only for girls.' `Well, I don't care if I do, if it is not very strong.' `That's you, Harefoot! I knew you were a man of spirit. You are coming out. Not to have been in the Gardens, and in Boston two months. I wish I had known you before. Two sangarces, Jim. By the by, do you know Ralph Mosley?— There he is!' `Yes, slightly,' answered Henry coldly. `I am told he is dissipated.' `That's a slander! He is a little wild or so, as all young chaps are, but he is as good-hearted a fellow as ever lived, and belongs to one of the first families.' `I have conversed with him, and find him dissolute,' said Harry, firmly; `yet I have nothing against him.' `Shall we ask him to drink with us?' said Lynch, as they took up their tumblers. `He is my particular friend, and I would like to have you know him better. Mosley!' The ex clerk's quick ear, as watchful as his eye had been in this direction, caught his name, and he came up to the place where they stood.— He expressed no surprise at seeing Harefoot at the bar with a glass of port wine in his hand, but addressed him cordially, while Lynch remarked, `Ah, you're already acquainted with my friend Harefoot, Ralph. So we are three friends together! Come, what'll you take? `I seldom touch any thing, and never stronger than wine; but as I see you are drinking, you may give me, Jim, a little of the ruby;' while he winked at the barkeeper who in reply handed him the decanter of brandy. `Is ruby a sweet wine?' asked Harefoot; `it strikes me I have heard of ruby wine.' `Yes, quite sweet,' gravely said Mosley, putting two teaspoonsful of pulverized sugar into his brandy toddy. `Well, here's luck!' The three young gentlemen then nodded to each other, and put the glasses to their lips.— Mosley took his `sweet wine' off at a pull; Lynch, who loved brandy better than port, but who feared to alarm his uninitiated acquaintance by calling for it, drank his off with less relish; while our hero with a burning cheek and a stinging conscience, drank a few swallows and sat it down.— But the charm of his integrity was broken, the silver cord that bound him to temperance was loosed, and he had yielded to his first temptation. The two friends exchanged looks of triumph, while Lynch said to his victim— `Oh, come, Harefoot, drink it up! It is nothing but wine, and won't hurt you.' `I have had enough,' he answered with indecision. `It is the rule among friends to empty glasses.' `O, very well,' said Henry, laughing with forced indifference; and with that sort of feeling which one departure from rectitude arouses in the mind, he caught up his tumbler and emptied it. `That's good,' said Mosley; `I like to see any thing whole-souled! Jim, let us have half a dozen Spanish cigars. Here, Harefoot, take one!— Here, Ned! They are delicious! Feel how elastic yet firm they yield to the pressure like the ball of the thumb when the rich blood is forced into it.' `I don't smoke, Mosley,' said Harry, declining the cigar. `I believe I must bid you good night.' `It is not half past eight,' said Lynch earnestly. `Come, let us take our cigars, and go down in one of the boxes and smoke and talk.' Persuaded in spite of his wish, to depart before he should be tempted further, Harefoot was led by them into the garden, each having an arm; and having seated themselves in a box, they prevailed upon him to light his cigar and smoke with them. The combined effects of the wine and the tobacco soon made him feel unpleasantly; and being for the present satisfied with their unexpect ed success, they escorted him to the outside of the garden, bade him a cordial good night, promised to call and see him the next day, and then, seeing him cross over the mall, returned into the scene of dissipation and vice where the irresolute Harefoot had met with his first fall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Augusta, Kennebec County, State of Maine, October 28, 182- My Dear Son Harry,—Your last letter gave us all at home a great deal of joy. I was gratified at your affectionate remembrance of me in sending the pretty cap, and I gave your love to little Emma Cutter, as you desired. She is knitting for you a purse she wants me to send you with our first package. I am happy to find you are so well pleased with your place, my son, and that Mr. Cushing is so well satisfied with you. You have only now, my dear boy, to do your duty to be respected. Never consider any thing beneath you which you are required by Mr. Cushing or the upper clerks to perform. Pride has ruined many young men who set out in life as prosperously as you have. Try and cultivate a kind demeanor, pleasing manners, and a frank and unsuspicious bearing; but as true politeness proceeds from grace in the heart, you must first cultivate that. Do not omit reading in the little Bible I wrote your name in, once a day, nor never neglect committing yourself in prayer to your heavenly Father when you go to bed nor thanking Him in grateful adoration when you rise up. Seek humbly his guidance through the day, and you will have it. There is no real good or true happiness that does not first originate in duty to our Maker. Avoid profane speech, impure language, and telling impure anecdotes, for they corrupt the heart. Spend your evenings at home in reading or writing, and your Sabbaths in the fear of God, going twice to church. Never break the Sabbath on any pretence! Let it be a holy day to you through life. Avoid the society of all young men whose character you do not know to be good; but it is best to have few companions and but one or two friends. Have no desire to go to the play, to parties, to frolies, and other scenes of temptation, and never without permission from Mr. Cushing, who is now to be in our place to you. Above all, my son, never touch a drop of wine. O that I could impress, as with a seal, this caution upon your heart—engraft it upon your mind. The sword has slain its thousands, but wine its tens of thousands. You must bear with me, Henry, for giving you such a grave letter of advice, but I have your welfare closely united to my heart, and I know that you are surrounded with temptations, and that you need not only a mother's love, but God's arm to guard and detend you. One thing more, Henry. You have, I know, a fondness for the society and admiration of young ladies. This at home in our quiet village was, perhaps well enough, as it improves the manners of youths to associate early in life with respectable young females. But in Boston there are, I blush to say, classes of females here unknown, who, with lovely countenances, and wearing alluring smiles, are dangerous for young men to know. `Their house,' saith the seventh of Proverbs. where she is described, `is the way to hell, going down to the chamber of death. Let not thine heart incline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. For she hath cast down many wounded; yea, many strong men have been slain by her.' Never, therefore, Henry, form any acquaintance with any young woman whose family or friends you do not know; no matter if she rustles in silks and glitters in laces, has the smile of Hebe and the beauty of a Helen. This is the last of the advice, dear Henry, I have to give you. I hope you will never have to repent the not keeping it. If a mother's prayers can be a shield and buckler to your head, you will not be left exposed, ungarded, my dear child, to the snares of this wicked world. If you want your shirts mended, or any thing of yours fixed nicely, send the things home in a bundle by Mr. Pearl, when he comes down in the sloop. The good old black made my heart glad yesterday when he told me he saw you in Washington street only last week, and said you were looking so handsome, and so well, and `like a born gemman, ebery inch o' him, mistress,' were Pearl's words. Your father and brothers and sisters send their love. Now good bye, my son, and write as often as you can. I have only left room to write—`Your affectionate mother, Anna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. Remorse of Harefoot—Lynch proposes to introduce him to a rich youth—Village aristocracy—The lace-purchaser—Our hero in more danger from true passion than feigned—Our hero is introduced to Bob Silsby—The recognition—Whist and whiskey-punches—Champagne and poker—Midnight—The proposed oyster supper—Bruce's Address—A Watchman with no car for music— Harry shows his wine—A retreat, and safe lodgment. The fresh air of the Mall removed his illness, and there, alone, in the solemn shadows of the walk, Harry had leisure to reflect upon his fall.— His reflections were intensely acute; and he strove to banish thought. His soul was heavy! He felt guilty and degraded before the tribunal of his own self respect. The stars in their pure homes seemed to reprove him, as he saw them looking down between the tree tops; the silence of the grove, the coolness of the breeze, the whole influence of nature, which is ever in discord with moral evil, in harmony only with the good, reproached him. `Had he indeed yielded to intemperance? Had he indeed visited a place of dissipation, been a companion of the disreputable Mosley, drank and smoked with him? Had he indeed surrendered his senses to the influence of the wine-cup! parted in a weak and vaccillating moment with the key to the golden casket of his character?' The thought was painfully humiliating to his sensitive mind. But more than all, he felt that he had unguardedly placed in Mostey's hands, in Lynch's also (over whom Stanwood's name threw a charm that withheld any suspicion of his real character,) the power over his reputation; and that if he yielded no farther, the consequences of his folly might still effect his reputation. He reached home, and sought his chamber.— As he laid aside his coat his mother's letter fell from the pocket, upon the floor. He caught it up with a cry of bitter reproach, pressed it to his lips, and sunk into a chair, overwhelmed with grief. `Yes, with this sacred letter in my pocket.' he said at length, `I have yielded to the very temptations it so affectionately warns me against. Three hours ago, when I read it, I made mental resolutions to obey it in every syllable. How weak my resolutions are, the last hour has bitterly shown me! I feel humbled to the ground! From this moment I resolve never to touch another drop of wine! I would I could as easily say that I would never speak to Mosley again, but I would not offend him. Lynch, though Stanwood's friend, seems to regard drinking a light thing. I would avoid both if it were not for offending them. How low I feel in my own estimation.' Without prayer, without opening his bible, for he was constrained by a sense of shame, which, properly directed, should, have led him to do both, he went to bed, and passed a sleepless night. The following day, at noon, when Mr. Cushing, Martin, and Stanwood were at dinner, and while he was engaged at the counter marking some goods which had just been purchased, Mosley and Lynch entered, arm in arm, and saluted him with great warmth of fridndship. He colored at the recollection of his last evening's folly, but they did not allude to it farther than to ask how he did. `I am not a very good wine-drinker,' he said smiling; `and I think I shall never gain much celebrity as a cigar smoker.' `You will soon get used to it,' said Lynch, lifting one leg upon the counter, and taking a yard-stick to play with. `No I shall not, I assure you,' he said, with some firmness; `I am resolved not to go into the Washington Gardens again, nor drink anything more. I am quite vexed that I should have consented.' `Folly,' said Lynch quickly; `don't think yourself, Harry, so much better than other people; nor believe it is such a great affair for a fellow to take a glass of wine now and then. There is'nt scarcely a gentleman but what takes his wine, or brandy and water. But we won't mention it to you, Harefoot, if you don't like it.' `I told you Harefoot was a puritan,' remarked Mosley, with a wink and a laugh, to conceal the scorn in his words, `but he can't deceive you and I. Lynch, with any of his shams. A young fellow like him, who knows a pretty milliner's apprentice well enough to help her open her shop, and who takes sangarees and smokes in the Gardens, might as well come to the point at once, and not fight shy.' `I am not fighting shy;' answered Henry, angry, yet condemned by his own conscience. `I have no desire to indulge in any dissipation.' `I believe you, Harefoot,' said Lynch, speaking in a generous tone. `We don't suspect you of playing Janus. You were tempted last night to break a rule, but there's no harm done. By the way, do you know Silsby?' `The rich young man?' `Yes; he who drives such splendid turnouts. He was in the gardens last evening when we were there, and this morning asked me what d—d fine looking young fellow (his very words) that was with us. And when I told him, he said he should like to know you.' `This is a great thing for Bob to say,' chimed Mosley; `he is very select in his acquaintances, and has few intimate friends. I should feel flattered by the voluntary notice of such a rich young fellow.' `I will introduce you, Harefoot, any time,' added Ned. The vanity of our hero was flattered; his aristocratic aspiration were instantly awakened; and as he had repeatedly seen and admired Silsby's stylish equipage, he felt not a little elated at the prospect of an introduction to him. The expression of his countenance showed Lynch that, in resorting to this invention, when he saw that it would be difficult to get him to go again to the gardens, he had not mistaken his man. `I should like to know him,' said Harry, his imagination placing him beside him in his phæton, his father admiring and approving his sudden rise, his townsmen seeing him, and Pierce Wentworth and Isabel gazing after him with envy. We are sorry Harry was so weak as to let such ideas enter his brain: but they did and influenced his reply. `I will come for you this evening when you shut up, and call on him at the Exchange.' `Does he board there?' asked Harry, with confused looks, as he recollected his first unlucky-dinner there. `Yes—stylish fellow! You will like him.— Will you be ready? Send your key home by your new boy.' `Well, I will go with you,' answered Harry; `You be here by eight o'clock, as I shall begin to shut up five minutes before.' Five minutes taken from his employer's time, five minutes departure from the rule of the store, for the sake of being introduced to one of the richest young men in Boston, who drove his own carriage, and had a servant in hvery, seemed no harm in the eyes of our hero; though in principle it was as fraudulent an appropriation as an hour! But this was Harry's error, to which his pride in anticipating the acquaintance of Mr. Robert Silsby, blinded him. If evils were single, they were less evil; but they procreate from one stem a marvellous quantity and variety of branches, till a broad Upas tree stands where a staff was dropped. The thought of an introduction to Silsby quite filled Harefoot's mind for some time after his previous night's associates left the store. Let us see where this error lay! To be on intimate terms with a few first families in Augusta, whom wealth, political, or judicial station, or legal eminence had given a high social position, was one of the weaknesses of our hero's father, the Augusta grocer. He was restless, anxious, and envious at the thought that there should be one family in town above his—that fashionable parties should be given by such, and himself and wife left out. Hearing his father talk so much of the Voses, the Bridges, the Williams', the Conys, and the Westons, early instilled into Harry's mind an exaggerated idea of the importance of such acquaintances; and he had, in his father's spirit, used every exertion to be intimate with the sons of these families, but only to have his sensibility wounded by their haughty feelings of superiority. This reaching after associates who thought them-themselves better than he, was a feeling he carried with him to Boston. This false view of things, thus imbibed at home, was the secret of the satisfaction he experienced at the contemplation of knowing one, whom any of those Judges, Generals, and Colonels son's, who had given him the cold shoulder, would be proud to associate with; for with him style and wealth (so he had been taught,) were respectability, and, in themselves, contained all the principles of good society. While he was thus occupying his mind with this subject, his hands the while folding up a piece of silk goods, he looked up at a footstep, when all the blood in his heart rushed to his temples; while a sensation of surprise and pleasure made his pulse bound! It was the beautiful glove-purchaser! Many times had he conjurod up that face and wondered who she was, while the lingering pleasure he took in dwelling upon it in memory, told him how deeply it had impressed him. Yet he might soon have forgotten her, had she not again appeared; but now that he beheld her once more, all the teelings of the day previous came back with new intensity. He in vain made efforts to suppress the emotion of pleasure that glowed on his cheek, and sparkled in his eyes, as he beheld her. But tempering his pulse as well as he could, be approached her with his eyes dropped to the floor. Ellen Emery smiled, and was conscious of her triumph. She seemed to enjoy for a moment his embarrassment, so rare in a young man, at least of such young men as she had known, as Ralph Mosley, for instance, and she gazed on his face with a deeper interest than her object could create, which was indicated by a thoughtful, tender expression in her eyes, and a deeper tone of feeling in her voice. `I wish to purchase—really, I forget what I do want! Oh, have you beautiful laces?' The boxes of laces were handed down by Harry, who could not keep his eyes from her face though they fell every time she would look up. `This is pretty for cuffs,' she said, laying a piece upon her truly lovely wrist, and scanning its effect, while Harry was admiring the hand. `What is the price of this?' she asked, flashing her brilliant eyes up into his face an instant, and then dropping the lids over them like the shadow of a dark cloud. `Two dollars,' he said examining the mark, and at the same time stealing a look at her mouth. Alas, poor Harry! the poison is creeping slowly into thy heart. `That is not high, it is so richly wrought. Do you go into society much, Mr. Harefoot?' `Very little,' he said, marvelling at her social manner. `You should do so! A young man with your face and figure—but what am I saying to a perfect stranger,' she said, looking down with well played confusion. `But you don't seem like a stranger to me, Mr. Harefoot.' `Henry,' asked Walter Berry, from the farther end of the store; `will you please tell me what af stands for on the goods?' `Wait a moment, and I will give you an alphabet key. `Henry! what a pretty name! Then your name is Henry?' she asked, with a most attractive frankness of manner. `Yes,' he replied blushing. `Well, Henry,—for so I will call you, if you won't be angry with me,' she said, with a captivating naivete that was irresistible, `you ought to go into company.' `I have little time,' he said, his voice subdued to the first low note approaching confidence. `You have your evenings, certainly. This lace is very pretty.' At the word `evenings' he thought of his mother's injunctions to keep at home; then flashed upon him her caution about forming acquaintances with females who were strangers to him, `no matter if they glittered in laces and rustled in silks.' He became embarrassed, glanced at her, and asked himself if such a beautiful, modest, pleasant young lady could be one whom his mother had warned him to flee. But she rustled in no silks, nor, though looking at laces, did she glitter in them; for her attire was a plain straw cottage, and a snow white dress, perfectly fitting her perfect shape. The idea had no sooner come into his mind than he banished it; for he was so much impressed with her beauty, and pleased with her manner, that had she `glittered in silks and laces,' he would have blinded himself to this interdicted costume, reluctant to be compelled to avoid one he believed all that her sex might envy, his own adore. `I will take three yards of this lace, Henry,' she said, playfully winding it about her finger.— `Where do you go this evening?' `I have an engagement at the Exchange,' he said, with a slight emphasis on the name of the fashionable Coffee House. `I hope it is no dissipation—no champagne supper,' she replied. `Ah, you gay young gentlemen are apt to be very wild!' `I assure you, Miss—(what would be not have given to know Miss who?) that I am only going there to see a gentleman. Besides, I have never entered into any of the dissipations of the town, and beg you will do me the justice to think so,' answered Henry with animation, desirous to have the good opinion of so beautiful a girl, who seemed to like him so well, and for whom he could not conceal his own deep admiration. `I did not think otherwise, Henry,' she answered earnestly. `But where have I left my purse!' she exclaimed, looking in her reticule as he handed to her the three yards of lace he had measured off, and put up in a shop bill. `I must have left it—yes, I remember, I called at Mrs. Otley's house in Colonnade Row, and gave it to her dear babe to play with, and must have left it in the cradle. I am so mortified! I am too tired to go back there.' `I will send Walter for it,' said Harry eagerly. `No, don't trouble him, and you will be alone in the store. I will take the lace another time, though I wanted it very much this afternoon.' `You can take it, and pay another day,' said Harry with imprudent haste. `I should regret you should be disappointed.' But to purchase the lace was not her intention. She only wished to strengthen the acquaintance, and to try the temper of his character. She found it what she had suspected—open and unsuspecting; one which would lead its possessor astray, if beauty allured, and passion impelled. She did not wish to involve him in difficulty at the outset, by his indiscretion, and was therefore firm in declining to take it. This refusal confirmed Harry's opinion that she was as worthy as she was beautiful; and when, with a smile and a bow, she left the store, as Stanwood entered, he resolved if he ever saw her again, not to leave her till he had ascertained all about her. Harry's heart was not interested! his vanity was gratified; he was flattered by her notice, and bewitched by her beauty. On her part, this second interview had given her the knowledge of her own heart, and betrayed to her that he whom she came deliberately to ruin, had become the master of her heart, the deep fountains of which the sensual Mosley had never unlocked. She felt that henceforth she required no resort to art for weapons, which love would now more readily furnish. At a few minutes past eight o'clock, the same evening, Lynch reached the store which he found closed, and Harry waiting for him. He took his arm, and they went together to the Exchange.— Silsby was in a handsome, lighted parlor opposite to his chamber, awaiting him with Mosley, who had planned that Silsby should become acquainted with the milliner's pretty apprentice, through Harefoot's introduction; for he well knew his own would not pass current. It was for this end that Silsby was awaiting Harry's arrival. `Is is already quarter past,' he said, looking at a richly chased gold watch. `Are you sure Lynch will fetch him?' `Yes. He is too anxious to know you, Bob, to let any thing prevent his coming. I told him you were desirons of knowing him! He bit at once. You must get his confidence by treating him civily, and he will be of use to you. `I'll invite him to drive out in my stanhope with me to Fresh Pond, day after to-morrow. `That is Sunday, and he is puritanic.' `I will manage that. Ah, there he comes.' `Sir, there is Mr. Lynch and his friend below,' said a servant, entering. `Show them up. Now for the little milliner! I passed there to day, and I never saw such a lovely little gypsy. But I must break ground carefully, I see by her eye!' `Yes, you can do nothing without being presented to her by some one she knows. Harefoot is the very man, if you can get him to serve you.' `Leave that to me. Ah, Ned, how are ye?— Glad to see you.' `How are ye, Silsby. Let me make you acquainted with my particular friend, Henry Hareoot.' `Mr. Harefoot I am glad to see you,' said Silsby, rising and shaking him heartily by the hand, and leading him to a seat. `I have solicited the pleasure of knowing you, and feel happy that you have done me the honor to call.' The ease and cordiality of his reception, the brilliancy of the apartment, the richness of the furniture, and elegant opulence pervading everything that he beheld, not a little dazzled him; but what embarrased him most of all was, that he recognised in Silsby, the gentleman whom he had sat next to at his memorable dinner, and whose wine he had helped himself to with such nonchalence. A second glance at his countenance, however, told him he was not recognized in return, and he became re-assured, though at the mo ment he felt like retreating, or hiding himself.— The hurried views he had had of Silsby with his hat on when he had seen him riding were not sufficient for him to identify him; but now that he saw him with his hat off, he did not fail to make the appalling recognition. Although Silsby betrayed no sign of having met him before, he distinctly recollected the features of his neighbor of the `cider.' A few minutes were passed in general conversation, when Silsby proposed a game at cards. Harry knew one suit of cards from another, but had never played. He blushed while he confessed. `Never mind, we will soon teach you,' said Lynch; and he drew his chair to a round table, in the middle of which a servant had laid a pack of cards. Harry felt he was doing wrong in yielding, but he had not the resolution to refuse, and he did not like to give offence to such a `rich young man' as Robert Silsby. Thus his want of moral courage, and his respect for money, combined, led him into acting against his sense of right. The cutting for `deal,' the `dealing,' the `trump' and the `lead,' were all a mystery to Harry, but Mosley kindly explained them to him, so that he soon understood them. After a little showing he was enabled to lead off with confidence, and play his cards with some freedom. The game was `whist.' He soon became interested in it; and although he made rather awkward work at dealing, vainly trying in the feat to imitate the rapid and graceful manner in which Lynch threw off the cards, he proved much better than a `dummy' to Silsby, who was his partner; and so they played half an hour, when Silsby desired Mosley to pull the bell, though he himself was nearest to it. But rich young men have privileges. `Charles,' he said to the colored attendant, as he stood bowing respectfully in the door, `tell the bar-keeper to send up four nectars—hot.' `Yes, saar,' answered Charles, disappearing. `Who deals? Your turn, Ned,' said Silsby.— `Well, Harefoot, how do you like the game?' `I must confess it is exciting, though it requires practice to understand its principles. It is a game of calculation. I thought before that cards were never played without gambling, and I felt alarmed for my rustic propriety when I heard you propose them, he said, laughing; for the society in which he found himself had adapted itself, for various reasons, to his humor, and so he was pleased with himself, with them, and was altogether in a fine flow of spirits. Much of his reserve of manner had worn off, and his companions were surprised to discover, that though he knew little of cards, he was witty, social—in cant phrase, `a capital fellow.' The `nectar' appeared in four goblets, in the shape of whiskey punches, hot, and alluring both to the eye and smell. A little plate of crackers was also on the waiter. `Hand them round, Charley!' said Silsby.— Harefoot, take one. You will find it delicious.— Ned—Ralph, help yourselves.' Harry, with the remembrance of last night, and recollection of his remorse and resolutions, had hesitated when the servant held the waiter to him; but not wishing to appear so singular as to decline, he took the glass, and set it beside his cards. The odor, as it ascended to his nostrils, was truly tempting. He had never conceived any thing more delightful! Yet he firmly resolved in his mind to withstand more than a simple taste for courtesy's sake. `What is this nectar, Mr. Silsby?' he asked, with such simplicity that the others believed, till they reflected an instant upon his ignorance of such matters, that he was quizzing. `It is a compound of delectables, ambient as liquid topaz, fragrant as jasmine, and inspiring as the waters of—of—of—what is that Greek spring we used to know at school, Mosley?' `Maranthon?' `No.' `Helicon,' said Harry. `That's it. Now you know what a whiskey— I mean a nectar is, Harefoot, eh?' Harry knew he was quizzed, but said nothing, resolving to drink no more, whatever it was; for his mother's warning lay close in his heart, where he had treasured up all her advice. The game advanced, and grew more intensely exciting, and discovered to Harry that he had a natural propensity for card playing, the occasion having been hitherto wanting to call it out. In the intervals of dealing, each had sipped his `nectar,' and Harry, ere he was sensible of it, found he had been sipping also, till he had drank half in the goblet. The effect of it was also more apparent to the others than himself. His eye was brighter, his manner bolder, his voice more earnest, and his whole demeanor elevated several degrees above the usual temperature. He laid his cards down on the board with an emphasis, and even disputed about the priority of a deal. A second series of whiskey-punches was ordered, and four empty glasses replaced upon the salver. Ten o'clock struck, and Haray had drank two whiskey-punches, and had by this time become somewhat noisy with the exhileration of his ideas! `Suppose we play `poker,” said Mosley. `Agreed,' responded Harry, who was innocent of the knowledge of any poker but the firepoker. `Suppose we bet a half,' said Lynch. `Done,' cried Harry, thumping his fist down on the table till the glasses rung again. `Let's have some of my old brand champagne first,' said Silsby. `Lynch pull that bell.' The champagne was brought, glasses were given to each, the wire was cut, the cork flew, and sparkling like a fountain of light, the tall glasses were filled to the bubbling brim. `Here,s to beauty,' said Silsby, lifting his glass. `Especially milliner's apprentices,' said Mosley who was a little excited. `Beauty it is, repeated Lynch, drinking off his champagne, and setting down his glass with a sigh. `Beauty and miller's apprentices, cried Harry, quaffing the delicate pink-hued wine. `Miller's be —,' said Mosley; `Milliner's it is. `I say, Mosley, I consider that personal—I'll allow no man to correct me! Don't you think I know a milliner from a miller!' retorted Harry, with drunken spirit. `Peace, gentlemen! Silence, Ralph!' cried Silsby, thumping on the table with a champagne glass, and knocking the bottom off. `How do you like that cider, eh, Harefoot? Don't you think it better than that you drank in the dining room a few months ago. Harry stared at the speaker with consternation. Mortification and shame sobered him instantly. He dropped his eyes in confusion, and sat silent and gloomy. `Pshaw, man,' said Silsby, laughing; `it was nothing to cry about; but a capital joke. By George, it is too good to be lost.' `Tell it, tell it!' cried Mosley and Lynch in the same breath. Silsby then related the incident as it occurred, but with such perfect good humor, and it was laughed at with such cheerful merriment by the others, that Harry not only took no offence, but joined in the laugh, and explained, in a lively manner, his elation at the discovery of the use of the long glasses set beside his plate. `And that was really wine, then?' he added, with a smile. `Yes, champagne! The same we have been drinking. `And is this wine, also?' `You didn't think it was cider?' `Upon my soul I did till this moment.' Loud and long was the laugh that followed this ingenuous confession. After the hilarious uproar had a little subsided, Silsby opened another bottle, and said, turning to him. `Now, Harefoot, as you took wine with me without asking, do me the honor to drink with me now by special invitation. Hold here, and let me fill your glass.' Harry, who was now quite sober, would have declined, but the circumstances under which the request was made, did not admit of a refusal.— He therefore let him fill his glass, and drank with him. `A bead!' cried Silsby, inverting his glass and catching the last drop on his thumb nail. `A bead,' repeated Harefoot, who had never heard the term before, yet instantly comprehended it; and finishing the wine, he turned up his glass in a like manner. They now began to play again with a better understanding of our hero's character, and he of theirs. The little incident that had passed had placed them on a better footing of social equality. Each was in good humor with his fellow. Poker, a notorious gambling game was now introduced, and Harry's last glass of champagne having made him supremely indifferent to any moral dictation from the wounded monitor within, he entered into the play with spirit, so soon as its principle was explained to him, and laid down his half dollar (nearly all the money he had in the world) with the full consciousness of wrong doing, but recklessly stifling the reproaches of his conscience. He seemed to be impressed with, and led by, that reckless feeling which suggests that, having given line so far to temptation, it were the same to let indulgence run the full length of her tether. The hours flew swiftly, and unheeded, till the end of their playing, when Silslby, looking at his watch, announced to the appalled ears of Harry that it was twelve o'clock. The deep tongue of the Old South at the same instant, bore testimony to its truth. `You owe me seventeen dollars and a half, Harefoot, remember,' said Silsby. `And Mosley, here is your five.' `And you owe me six, Harry,' added Mosley, pocketing his winnings. `And two dollars to me,' continued Ned. `And you, Ned, are indebted to me eight—no nine,' cried Silsby, examining the scores. Harry listened with consternation. The excitement of play—the elevation of the wine had gone, and left him the cool, sad contemplation of the fruits of the evening's enjoyment—happiness dearly bought. His mind was stunned at the idea of having incurred a debt of twenty-five dollars—and that a gambling debt. He stood silent and sad with the bitterness of that moment's reflection. To this was added a scarcely less painful evil—the late hour he was abroad! It was the first time he had ever been out after nine. How should he get in—how should he conceal his late hours, or excuse himself to the inmates! how to Mr. Cushing, if he should be informed of it! `But how,' he groaned inwardly, `how shall I ever be reconciled to myself—how forgive myself for this folly.' `Why, man, you look as melancholly as Death in the Primmer,' said Lynch, slapping him on the shoulder. `Come, take a glass of brandy and water. It will make you a new man.' `Never mind the money, Harefoot,' said Silsby, `if it is not convenient. Pay me when it is; or, perhaps, some other time you may turn the scales. Come, fellows, let us charge once round before we separate.' The decanter of brandy went round, and Harry suffered the tumbler Silsby had placed in his hand to be filled without speaking. They touched their glasses, and each drank off his parting cup, Harry quaffings his down with a sort of a desperate hope of finding in it relief from his painful reflections. It was now proposed by Lynch that they should all go together to O'Bruce's and get a supper of oysters, and then see Harefoot home. Harry consented to go with them, for he felt now too heart-wretched to regard, for that night, any farther consequences that might ensue. They navigated down stairs to the court door, with no little noise of stumbling boots and clattering sticks, to the consternation, or wrath of sundry sleepers, whose doors they passed on their way. The night was exceedingly brilliant, with a clear saphire vault, in which the star sparkled with unusual splendor. For a moment the beauty and stillness of the hour awed them. But their brains were too much under the influence of the brandy they had just drank, for the sweet and holy influences of night and heaven to affect them long. Four abreast, arm locked in arm, each with a lighted cigar in his mouth, a stick under his arm, and keeping tramp-pace, they took their way into State street, and along the shadows of the ancient State House into Washington street, up which they turned. As they reeled on, each a support to the other, Silsby broke out singing `Bruce's Address,' when all struck in with such a medley of horrid discords, by way of choral accompaniment, that a watchman who was quietly dozing on the corner by Cummings &amp; Hilliard's book store, was waked out of his sleep by the noise, and crossed the street to them. `You must walk quietly, gentleman,' he said respectfully. `I have a right to sing. There's no law against a man's singing when he is in a mood for it, Charlie,' responded Silsby— `Scotts' wha'ha' wi' Wallace—' `I say you must not sing and disturb the streets,' said Charlie, peremptorily. `Sing away, Silsby,' said Harry, who, with wine and brandy, and novel excitement, was quite as ripe for any thing, as a young man would wish to be; and in a loud tone of defiance Harry continued, `Scotts' whom Bruce has often led,' `Go it, Harefoot, that's your sort,' cried his-companions. `We'll whip Charlie, if he is'nt d—d civil.' `Yes—we are not to be stopped in walking the streets by an infernal watchman,' said Silsby. `We are gentlemen,— `Scotts' wa'ha' wi—' Here the watchman laid his hand upon his collar, when Harry, adding in a loud tone, `Welcome to your gory bed,' deliberately knocked the watchman over into the gutter, and releasing Silsby from his hold. `Now, fellows, we must fight or run,' said Lynch, as the watchman clambered to his feet, and sprung his rattle.' `Run it,' said Silsby, `for the Exchange!' At a rate of speed, no one who had seen them reeling along four abreast but a few minutes before, would have believed of them, they fled down the lane from Washington street, through a dark alley, into Exchange place, pursued by three watchmen, springing their rattles, he who had been knocked down, foremast. By fortunate chance the Coffee House door was yet un-barred and Silsby, throwing it open, got them in, and barred it, just as the watchman touched the curb-stone before it. `We are safe now, but have lost our oyster-supper,' said Lynch. `Harry, you gave him a scientific flooring.' `Come to my room, boys,' said Silsby. `It will not be safe for you to go home to night.— Harry, you shall share my bed! By George, you are a brave fellow in a spree?' `Harefoot's good stuff, and no mistake,' responded Mosley, as they ascended to his room. Harry was not sorry to remain all night, knowing he could not get in at his boarding-house; and, after being assured that he should be waked by Silsby's servant at six, he retired, though not till they had taken another `brandy and water' all round to `make them sleep.' But sleep visited not Henry's senses till cockcrowing, when he sunk into an uneasy slumber, from which he was called at six o'clock by the black servant stealing into the darkened chamber, and softly rousing him. He rose with a sensation in his head as if it were hooped with an iron band; with a parched tongue that loathed and sickened at its own taste; with fevered hands, and painful eyes; with a conscience ringing its loud censures; and a soul weighed down with a sense of guilt, upon which horror, remorse, and despair, sat like a moral Cerberus guarding forever the passage back to hope, happiness, and peace.</field>

The whole of the day was passed by Henry in a state of mental torture from a lively conscience, from a nervous fear of being questioned by Mr. Cushing, from constant apprehension that his wandering from the path of rectitude would be momently discovered, to his shame and disgrace. But Stanwood had been that night absent in the country with his parents, for the purpose of discussing with them his contemplated change from Mr Cushing's store into the importing house at the corner of Kilby and State streets; and as Henry had occupied his chamber alone since Burnham had been dismissed, his absence proved not to have been known. He, nevertheless, passed a very unhappy day. The sense of debt degraded him, and again and again he condemned his folly! But he could not endure to think upon the events of the past night, and crushed all reflection under a sullen and morose countenance. The change in him was noticed by all in the store; but he having attributed his looks to illness, it passed by with the kind remark from Mr Cushing, that, if he did not become better, he had best go to his lodgings, and remain. The day, however, was passed in a more cheerful spirit by another character in our story of reality—Pierce Wentworth. Mr Libby was engaged in erecting a handsome private edifice in Winthrop Place, and had given the charge of completing the architectural ornaments of the saloon to Pierce, whose genuis, taste, and skill he had early discovered, and availed himself of. Four doors, two in the Roman, and two in the Grecian style, opened from this hall, and were to be finished with pilasters, mouldings, entablatures, and carved work, for which skilful journeymen are usually only employed. But Mr Libby had discovered in his apprentice not only a desire to learn his trade well, but a capacity to comprehend its principles with the most careless explanation.— He had given him many nice bits of work to do in the shop, to try his abilities, and he was surprised at the perfect neatness and finish with which they came from his hands. But what led him to place entire confidence in him, and place work in his hands he himself was accustomed to do, was, that one evening he went into his little sleeping room (for he boarded at his house,) to look for a volume of the Encyclopedia which was missing, and to which he wished to refer for the purpose of comparing some plates in a new work on architecture, with those in the article headed `Architecture;' with which he believed it to differ. Pierce had just gone out to convey a little package to his sister that had come that day in a parcel of his own, from home. Mr Libby was so struck at the appearance of things there, that he paused to survey them. Beside a little window was Pierce's table, on which burned a shade-lamp. A great number of books upon construction lay upon it, with drawing sheets covered with diagrams, outlines of the different orders of architecture, drafts of entablatures, doors, stair-ways, and plans of buildings, all neatly executed. A beautiful model of a Grecian temple in rose-wood, all its parts distinct, so that it could be taken to pieces and put together like a dissected map, stood on a chair. But what surprised him most, and laid the foundation for respect and confidence, was his astonishment at seeing on a table before his chair the volume of the Encyclopedia he sought, spread open at the index ARC, with a pair of compasses and a Gunter's scale laid on it, as if they had just been in use, and the very Plate he wished to refer to exposed to view! But his surprise was increased to find, on turning up a large book that lay face down beside it, that it was a library copy of the very new work he held in hir hand, open at the Plate he wished to compare with that in the Encyclopedia. A piece of paper lay under it, on discerning diagrams upon which, he took it up and examined them, when he found, to complete his astonishment and pleasure, that the sedentary apprentice had not only discovered the inaccuracies in the new work, but he had demonstrated them by diagrams and comparisous of drawings. From that time he afforded him every aid and opportunity in his power for the development of his talents. Instead of envy, his fellow apprentices, as well as the journeymen, acknowledged his superiority; while his kind manner and cheerful temper made them friends. A few days before that which the erring Harry passed so wretchedly, wishing for night that he might forget his guilt and anguish in sleep, Pierce was engaged in the beautiful creation, from Greek models, of the details of the architectural ornaments of the saloon. In one of the finished apartments, adjoining, was a table, on which lay his drawings and instruments, while in the hall, with a coarse apron on, and in a brown linen jacket, he was at work embodying to the eye of taste in wood, the forms of which the drawings gave the outlines. A gentleman with urbane manners and courteous appearance, entered and examined the drawings for some time, with the eye of one who understood them. Pierce, who saw him while working in the saloon, watched his countenance with deep interest, and was delighted to see from its expression that he was pleased. After a little while, he took a sheet in his hand, and, coming into the hall, began to compare what was done with what had been projected. While doing so, Mr. Libby came in and addressed him as Mr. Cunningham, who informed him he had called at the suggestion of the owner to look at the house. `I am very much pleased with your plans, and the style of this saloon, Mr. Libby,' he said; `and will have my own house constructed on the same plan. These drawings, aside from the taste and knowledge of architecture, look like copper plate, and are the most beautiful I have ever seen.— They alone are sufficient testimonials of your skill as an architect.' `They are not mine, sir,' said Mr. Libby, looking proudly across the apartment at the blushing Pierce, who very closely busied himself with the cornice he was finishing; `I should be glad to be able to draught so well.' `Who then is the architect?' `There he stands at work upon the frieze.' `You are inclined to be pleasant upon me, Mr. Libby,' said the gentleman smiling. `I beg your pardon, sir; but that young man is the executor of the drawings, as well as the author of the combined and beautiful styles which you so much admire in the saloon.' `He is scarcely nineteen! Can it be possible?' said Mr. Cunningham, looking at Pierce as he stood at work in his apron and jacket, and then at the drawings he held in his hand, while Pierce, who, as well as his fellow-workmen, had heard the conversation, felt emotions of pride and pleasure. He only wished Isabel and his father had been present to have heard. After gazing upon the young architect a moment, with a look of interest and admiration, Mr. Cunningham asked to be introduced to him. `Young man,' he said, shaking him warmly by the hand, `you have done, not only yourself, but your profession great credit. But I will not spoil you by praise, lest you think you have already attained when there is much yet to reach after.— You must come and visit me some evening and see my library, in which I have a large collection of works on architecture, the study of which is a passion with me. Mr. Libby let him come to my house some evening this week. I should like to know you better, young sir.' Pierce gratefully and modestly thanked him, marvelling that drawings such as he had thought nothing of making, when at school, should be thought worthy of such praise in Boston. But he found that the school-boy's genius as a draftsman and modeller, was likely to be made available beyond building nursery houses for pretty little girls like Mary Boardman, and drawing pictures to adorn it. The third day afterward, Mr. Libby asked his apprentice if he had yet been to Mr. Cunningham's house. Pierce replied in the negative, saying he presumed a gentleman like him would scarcely be likely to think of him a second time; and might be surprised at his accepting his invitation. `No, no, my boy,' said Mr. Libby. `Mr. Cunningham is s gentleman of fortune and taste, and great benevolence of character; he takes great interest in rising talent, and none will so quickly command his notice as genius in architecture.— Go this evening, if you are not otherwise engaged, for he will expect you.' At eight o'clock the same evening, (and at the very same hour Harry Harefoot went with Lynch to call on Silsby,) Pierce, attired in his Sabbath suit, ascended the handsome Ionic Portico of Mr. Cunningham's elegant mansion on Summer street. For a few moments he paused to gather courage before ringing. A well-dressed black servant answered the bell. With a palpitating heart he entered the lofty hall, and the servant, throwing open a polished mahogany door in the right, ushered him into a magnificent double drawing-room, and receiving his name went out, saying he would inform Mr. Cunningham of his being there. With astonishment and awe, not unmixed with that pure delight which combinations of wealth and taste always produce on intelligent minds, the apprentice surveyed the noble apartments.— Two bronzed candelabra, supported by lions rampant in the front room filled it with brilliant light, while the inner room was shaded in pleasing twilight. The number, richness, and great size of the pictures suspended by silken cords upon the walls; the gorgeous drapery of the windows descending from gilded spears crossed above, quite down to the floor; the beauty of the furniture which consisted of costly chairs, ottomans and couches, covered with velvets, the colors being different in the different rooms; the splendor of the mantel ornaments, and the numberous articles of show and furniture, unknown to him by name filled him with surprise and pleased wonder. The luxurious carpets gave back no sound to his footsteps, and the gorgeous stillness that pervaded the rooms was painful to him. The servant had requested him to be seated, but the chairs looked too rich to be sat in, and not seeing any that looked like the family chairs, he remained standing. The door of the inner room turned, without a sound, upon its hinges, and Mr. Cunningham entering the drawing-room unheard, approached Pierce, whose eye at that moment was caught and fixed by a magnificent engraving of the Parthenon. `I am glad you have remembered me, my young friend,' said Mr. Cunningham, as he took him kindly by the hand. `I expected you before, and had my books taken down from the shelves for you.' Pierce ingenuously replied that he had feared he should intrude himself upon his courtesy, and so had delayed coming until Mr. Libby assured him he would expect him. `Yes, I did, and am pleased that you have come. Now be so kind as to accompany me into my library.' Pierce, not a little pleased at his reception, followed him into the hall and up a grand staircase, from the first landing of which a side flight of half a dozen broad stairs conducted to a small saloon, beyond which was the door of a library, which Mr. Cunningham opened and invited Pierce to enter. If the drawing room below stairs had astonished him with the display of paintings furniture and drapery, this apartment surprised him with the splendor and vast number of the books that, placed in handsome mahogany, literally walled it. It put him in mind of a bookstore, yet was as different from one as were the drawing-rooms from an upholsterer's shop. A lamp of peculiar construction shed a soft sunny light throughout every part of the room, while no portion of the glary flame was visible. Tables stood around, covered with large folios; tall frames supported mammoth volumes; and racks of drawings and plates, and models of temples, villas, and public edifices, were ranged around in perfect order. At one of the tables, sat a handsome young man, the expression of whose face impressed Pierce very favorably, engaged in reading a huge volume entitled the `Commerce of Nations.'— Mr. Cunningham introduced him to Pierce as Mr. Stanwood, saying, `I am confident you will like each other, young gentlemen, though your tastes are something different—Frank here having a passion for whatever relates to mereantile matters.' Stanwood shook Pierce very cordially by the hand, said he had heard Mr. Cunningham speak of him, and was anxious to know him. Mr. Cunningham then seating himself at his writing-desk, said to Pierce, `Excuse me, young gentleman—I am finishing a letter that I wish to send off by the post.— Frank will entertain you; or perhaps you can amuse yourself. There is a volume which will engage you till I am at leisure.' He pointed, as he spoke, to a large folio of fine engravings of edifices remarkable for their correct styles, which lay open upon a frame near him. Pierce was soon so deeply engaged in their examination that he quite forgot where he was, till startled by a little table-bell which Mr. Cunningham rung, and which was answered by a servant who received his letter with directions to take it to the Post Office. Mr. Cunningham, Pierce and Stanwood now entered into an interesting and instructive conversation, during which both young men were strnck with the intelligence of each other. The evening passed away most agreeably to Pierce, in examining models and drawings, and listening to the intelligent and instructive remarks of Mr. Cunningham, who on his part was gratified by the deep interest which Pierce took in what he saw and heard, and was as favorably impressed with his talents and good sense as he had been surprised at his genius. When, as the bell rang nine he was about to take leave, he loaned him two or three valuable books, and offered him the use of his library; and desired him to visit him again the next evening, and bring with him the drawings he had made for the saloon, on which he was at work. He went home greatly pleased with Cunningham, and delighted with Stanwood, whose mother he learned was a neice of Mr. Cunningham who invited him to visit his home as freely as if-he were his son.— As with proud and happy emotious he felt that nothing was wanting to his enjoyment but Isabel, and all he loved at home to share it with him. He took his way homeward up Summer street, whose magnificent lining of elms over rearching from either side, made all deep gloom underneath, which a street lamp at long intervals scarcely enlivened. As he walked along with a free, elastic step, and his coat buttoned to his chin (for the night was chilly,) and was passing the old church near the head, he felt some one pull at his skirt, and at the same time a plaintive voice ask for `bread.' He looked down, and saw in the gloom a mere child,—an infant, as it were,—trotting at his side, holding on to his coat. He stooped down, and kindly spoke to it. `I want a cent to buy bread,' said the little shiverer. `You need both to be clad and fed,' he said, touched with pity at seeing a child not six years old out at such a time of night begging. On questioning it, he learned that he did not want bread for himself but his mother, who was sick. Desiring the child to guide him, he followed it through Franklin Arch and entered Theatre Alley, a narrow, dismal passage in the rear of the theatre, uniting two parallel streets, and then lined with the dwellings rather of poverty than vice. A dim lamp burning at each extremity and one midway, were just sufficient to guide the foot-passenger.—The child trotted along with familiar step, and led him a little ways down the alley and then turned with him into a wretched yard surrounded by low buildings. He knocked on the door of one of these and a child little older than himself opened it. The interior was quite dark, but Pierce heard a woman's weak voice say, `Billy, dear, have you come?' `Yes, mama, and brought a good gentleman with me.' `God be thanked,' said the poor woman; `there is yet some charity left for the poor! Did you bring bread, sir?' `No, but I will at once. Have you no way of making a light?' `None—we are destitute.' `I will return in a few minutes,' said Pierce, quitting the door-way in which he had stood. In less than five minutes he returned from a grocer's on the corner of Milk street with candles, bread, apples, dried fish, and several other articles, all that the grocery afforded, and all his little money would buy. He soon made a light which showed a wretched apartment, destitute of furniture or bedstead, the bed being upon the floor.—What a contrast, thought he, with a sigh, to the gorgeous drawing rooms he had been in that evening. He learned that she was a widow with two children, the boy who had been sent out begging and a girl ten years old, who was dumb. She said her husband had been a blacksmith, but having been kicked by a horse, was compelled to give up hard work, and take to one employment and another to support his family, till no class of working people owned him, and so he had friends among none of them. To help himself along, he hired himself as watchman, but the night air and exposure gave him the consumption, with which, after a long sickness, he died, leaving her not only in debt, but destitute. `We have been driven from shelter to shelter,' she said, `since he died, which was two years ago, and I made out to do by taking in washing till I sprained my wrist. I then had to live off of what little furniture and things I'd saved by sellin' `em till I ha'nt any thing but this straw bed and blanket. I have been too sick for three weeks to help myself, and my little boy has supported us along by begging. But he got nothing all day, and as we had nothing to eat he went out of his own accoad.' `You are indeed in wretched circumstances, madam,' said Pierce, who unused to scenes of metropolitan wretchedness, had heard her narration of her sufferings with deep interest, and the liveliest sympathy. Assuring her that he would make her case known to some benevolent persons, he left her and her children as comfortable as he could make them, and with the consciousness of having done his duty, he took his way homeward, with the intention of immediately making the poor woman's case known to Mrs. Libby, who he knew would at once take steps to improve her condition. How much better relieving the indigence of the watchman's widow, than knocking poor watchmen down; hard working men, who to eke out the small wages of the day, stand half the night in storm and wind, cold and wet, to preserve order and decorum, that citizens may sleep in quiet and know their property to be protected. As Mr. Libby lived in Boylston street, Pierce, after reaching Washington street, kept along its western side-walk. In front of the Lamb Tavern, which stood near where is now erected a handsome granite building, he saw a group of young men, one of whom called him by name as he was passing. He stopped and found a knot of apprentices, most of whom were known to him. They were lounging against a lamp-post and talking about having a sail on Sunday, down the harbor. Pierce was invited to join them. `Not on Sunday,' he said, promptly. `But if we don't go that day we can never go at all,' said the one who had hailed him, whose name was Cyrus Foster, and who was apprenticed to a carpenter. `I should rather not have any indulgence, if I purchased it by breaking any one of the Commandments,' answered Pierce, without any of that weakness which leads young men to fear to confess any reverence for God. `We have as much respect for the Sabbath as any body, Wentworth,' said another of the young men, `but we must have some time for recreation; we work hard all the week, and then to stick up in a meeting-house all Sunday is `no play.' `I don't see any more harm in going a sailing than in riding to meeting, as the ministers do,' said Foster. `I am sorry you differ with me,' said Pierce, `but if I should consent to go, I should not enjoy myself, with the consciousness of wrong doing.' `You are too strict, Wentworth; but each one for himself, said Foster, feeling mortified. Pierce, after a little more conversation, bade them good night, and passed on his way. `You might have known he would'nt have gone,' said John Clifford, a journeyman cabinet maker, sluringly; `he belongs to our Engine, and never comes to club meetings because he says he don't like to drink; and at that last fire in Broad street, where he behaved so well, and took the keg of powder out of the blazing counting-room when the hoops had become hot, he refused, when we got back to the Engine house, to drink the the wine the merchant sent up after us; and what was strange, though he was wet through he took no cold.' `He'll never be introduced to any of the girls, no matter how pretty they are, nor goes to walk with any in the Mall, Sunday evenings, as other apprentices do,' said one, who wore a ruffied shirt and was smoking a long nine. `I saw him once walking with a right handsome girl,' said Clifford. `That is his sister,' answered Foster, `and a pretty girl she is. But I don't know her. But he's a clever fellow.' The conversation now turned upon the projected pleasure sail, on the next day, and it was decided that it should take place, on the ground that if apprentices did not amuse themselves upon the Sabbath and be happy, they never could. True happiness alone consists in obedience to divine laws: and the false pleasure temporarily derived from infringing them, is not enjoyment. The plea so often offered by apprentices for breaking the Sabbath, as, we are sorry to say, they are so openly in the habit of doing, is as shallows as it is vain. Thieves might as well argue that if they did not steal in this world they never could! murderers, that if they did not kill here they never could! Sabbath breaking, a wilful shutting their ears to the weekly instructions of the gospel, is the great prime cause of the recent demoralization among apprentices, which has led them in large cities, to constitute themselves into lawless bands, that are ready to congregate in seasons of political excitement, in powerful mobs—powerful from the combined recklessness and intelligence of its components—subverting all order, and menacing the very existence of civil and political liberty. This forming clubs and adopting certain styles of hat, of wearing the hair, or of shaping the coat, for the purpose of appearing rowdy and independent, is one of the evils of their position, as censurable as that of fine dressing, vanity and aping fashion among clerks; but of the two, dandy and rowdy, the latter is the most to blame for his folly, as the fact of his having chosen the hammer instead of the yard-stick, is presumptive evidence of his superior common sense. Though we write and have written in defence of trades, and contend that the position of apprentices, in the social system, infinitely superior in every way to that of clerk, we are not ignorant that there are peculiar temptations to each condition; but we contend that of one hundred apprentices and the same number of clerks entering into their respective stores and shops together, twelve years will bring a comfortable independence to eighty of the former, while not twenty of the latter live, if they are living at all, or are not cast away—in the enjoyment of competence. The life of the mechanic is even, and the tenor of his course is uninterrupted (save in great national calamities that overwhelm indiscriminately, all men alike) by the viscissitudes, precarious outlays, uncertain ventures and anxious watchfulness of the merchant. If he derives not so much income from his labor, it is a certain and increasing one; and as his notions of style are temperate and sensible; as he neither aspires to great houses, nor apes the costly glitter of fashion, it is enough for his happiness, and for his comfort, and for his respectability, and for the education of his children. Mechanics can soon become owners of the houses they live in, by paying down three or four hundred dollars, giving a mortgage on the house, and then from year to year paying what would otherwise pay for its rent on the mortgage The retail merchant can seldom become owner of a house; for his income is uncertain, and his notions lead him to desire a mansion that itself would swallow a fortune; consequently he becomes a tenant of a stylish house along side of the neat two story dwelling which his cabinet-maker lives in, and which he owns. Apprentioes have, also, very little unemployed time, and are not exposed to that idleness which irresistably leads to vicious habits; while the boy in a store is idle half the time, either lounging about the counter, or perched on a stool playing with a yard-stick and talking with the neighbor's clerks, or stuck away in a corner half hidden by a bale of goods, reading interdicted and demoralizing books. The apprentice has not the temptation to steal, which the `clerk' daily has, surrounded as he is by rich goods of every variety, which are at any moment convertable into money. The former handles none of his master's funds, and is not tempted to appropriate small change, which in the end leads to bank robbery and the penitentiary; he is not exposed hourly to female temptation like the clerk; nor do fashionable places of amusement and dissipation allure him to their haunts; his amusements may be boisterous and unfashionable, perhaps, but they are rarely ruinous to his character; cards and wine, billiards and driving, rioting and harlotry, are very seldom his pursuits. Pierce sought his home; and after sitting up till twelve o'clock in his chamber looking over the books Mr. Cunningham had loaned him, he reverently read a chapter in his Bible and went to bed. How differently had Pierce and Harry passed the hours of that long evening! How much sweeter was the calm sleep of the upright apprentice than the restless, feverish slumbers of the risting clerk. How bright and fresh did Wentworth wake at sun-rise, and with what cheer fulness he rose and went to his work! At breakfast he gave Mr. Libby an account of his agreeable visit to Mr. Cunningham's, and also laid before his benevolent wife the case of the poor watchman's widow; and happy was he to learn before the forenoon was over, that she had placed her under the care of a charitable association of mechanic's ladies, whose Christian, self-imposed task it was to provide for the destitute families of mechanics. Cheerfully he passed that day, for the consciousness of doing right is in itself happiness — While at his work in the saloon, in his apron and brown jacket as before, Mr. Cunningham came in accompanied by Col. Gardiner, the owner of the house which Mr. Libby was building, and by a very fashionable young gentleman in ruffles, in whom Pierce recognized his fellow passenger, Mr. George Washington St. John Leighton. The young exquisite took up his glass and began leisurely to survey the saloon, when in its range his eye fell on Pierce, whom he seemed to recognize, while Wentworth slightly bowed. Mr. St. John Leighton looked surprized, stared, and with a contemptuous curl of his lip, turned away on his heel, muttering, `Impertinence.' Pierce understood the feeling of the haughty young graduate and smiled, but by no means felt troubled at being cut by him. Mr. Cunningham, who had lingered with Col. Gardiner in the door to examine it, now walked forward over the refuse with which the floor was strewn, and approaching Pierce, said, `Ah, good afternoon, Mr. Wentworth, hard at work again! Let me introduce to you Col. Gardiner, who till I told him was ignorant that you were the draftsman of the plan of the ornaments for the hall.' Pierce laid down his chisel and blushing, though not so weak as to speak an apology for his appearance, he frankly took Col. Gardiner's offered hand. Mr. St. John Leighton witnessed this with surprise, and seeing that they sometime stood in conversation with him, he became restless, and after walking in and out of the several rooms, carefully avoiding contact with any object that might soil his attire, he returned into the saloon still to find them engaged with him examining drawings. `Youah seem to honah that youth, uncle Gardenare, more than oi conceiveah he is enchitled toah,' he drawled in a tone of affected nonchalance, `Oi believe oi will not inchude moi companyah, as oi seem to be forgotten, and oi will respectfullyah bidah youah a good dayah!' `Good day, George,' said Col. Gardiner, not looking up from the drawings; `we shall expect you to tea.' `Perhaps youah friendah with the apronah, will honah you, uncle, inah my steadah,' replied Mr. St. John Leighton loftily. `I shall certainly feel honored in having a young man of genius like him at my table, and if you come and Mr. Wentworth will oblige me, I promise you shall meet him there.' `Then I beg,' said Leighton, in a tone divested of its drawling affectation, `to be excused. I have not been in the habit of associating with carpenters' apprentices.' Col. Gardiner looked angry and was about to reply, when seeing Pierce smile with quiet composure, he said nothing; but Mr. Cunningham could not withhold some sharp remarks upon the weakness so common to many young men of family, of considering beneath their notice and common civility, persons in mechanical employments. `When that foolish young man is forgotten by all but his tailor and haberdasher,' he said with asperity, `you, Wentworth, will with pride be remembered by your country, and long live in the enduring monuments of your genius.' Mr. George Washington St. John Leighton took his departure without deigning to notice these words which he had heard. Stopping in the portico he drew forth a cambric handkerchief, the perfume from which as he unfolded it penetrated the saloon, and having carefully dusted his boots, he insolently placed his glass to his eye to give Wentworth what he meant for a parting glance of contempt, and then swinging his rattan, walked towards Washington street, to lounge and stare at the ladies. Mr. St. John was a very harmless young person. He had no bad habits, but he then had no very good ones! his sense was not quite `common,' and approbativeness and self-esteem were his most prominent phrenological developments!—He did not smoke—he perfumed! He did not drink—but he made free use of Cologne water! He did not play cards, but he carried a pearl card case! He did not keep a mistress, but he did a puodle! He was nephew and ward of Col. Gardiner; but preferred living at a hotel to living with his uncle, who preferred having him do so. He would be of age in four months, when he would come into two thousand a year, on which he intended to live the harmless, perfumed, poodling life he had now entered upon. The day being Saturday, work closed at four o'clock, this being a rule of Mr. Libby's, with which Col. Gardiner, as well as other gentlemen he had builded for, acquiesced; his motive being to give his men not only time to transact whatever family affairs they had not been able to do through the week, so as not to encroach upon the Sabbath, but to let them prepare for it with more leisure. He knew well, by experience, the value of two hours before sunset to the hardworking man, and it is to be regretted his example is not oftener followed by others. Our great Master, the architect of the Universe, gives us one day out of seven, all of which are equally his, in which he not only says we may not, but we must not work; cannot the Christian master give his laborers one or two hours of the six days that are his! Insist not too strongly on having the `pound' of flesh. Pierce after returning home and dressing, took this hour to visit and examine with a little drawing book in his pocket, the public buildings of the city, noting their disagreements with the rules of art as well as studying their correct proportions. The edifice towards which he this afternoon directed his steps were the princely and tasteful mansion of Mr. Sears, on Beacon street. The proprietor having observed from the window, an intelligent looking young man stand some time opposite, apparently taking an outline of his house, and then observing him walk, to view both ends and finally stand and commence a drawing of the portico, the proportions of which he seemed to have some difficulty in getting from the outside of the gate, he became interested in his pursuit and sent a servant to invite him into the court. Pierce, who had been so absorbed in his study as to be unconscious of being particularly observed, hesitated, and then gratefully accepted the invitation, lifting his hat to the proprietor, whom he saw looking out from one of the bow windows. After the drawing was completed, Mr. Sears sent for him with the request to be permitted to see the fruit of his observations. Pierce followed the servant into a spacious and finely proportioned hall, and was conducted into a front room which was a library, where was seated the gentleman whose taste and wealth had erected such an ornament to Boston, as his magnificent dwelling. He was seated at a very large circular table, which turned upon a pivot, bringing round within reach of the hand by the slightest movement whatever book or paper lay on the opposite side of it. When Mr. Sears discovered that instead of a mere view of the house that his paper presented in detached parts, the architectural profile and details alone, he was surprised, and asked if he had studied ed architecture. Pierce's reply led to further conversation, which resulted in the benevolent and gentlemanly proprietor taking him over his spacious house and showing him its plan; and, expressing when he left, the most cordial interest in him, invited him to come and see him whenever he should find time. `Truly,' thought Pierce as he closed behind him the gate of this abode of opulence and taste, `I have found, since I have been in Boston, that the true gentleman—he, whose position by education, wealth and taste, is established, has none of that feeling of superiority with reference to trades' people that is felt by `first classes,' as we call them in `Augusta' and such towns! It is only the `little respectabilities,' those who feel their position not properly defined, and who tremble for it, that look so far above mechanics, lest if theybe seen speaking to them they may be thought to be no higher than they. `What,' he thought to himself, smiling, `would Harry Harefoot have said had he seen me last night at Mr. Cunningham's, or just now in Mr. Sear's library?' It was now sun-down and hastening to take his walk with Isabel, which he did every Saturday evening, he soon arrived at the milliner's shop of Mrs. Prescott. She met him with a glad welcome; and Mrs. Prescott inviting him up stairs to tea, he remained. After tea, Isabel tied on her hat, wrapped herself warmly in a plaid blanket shawl, and taking her arm went with him towards the Common, where they loved most to walk; its trees and green associating in their minds the fields and woodlands about their native town.</field>

The invitation to ride—Stanwood's advice—Harry unexpectedly meets the glone-purchaser— The confectioner's—Stanwood and Isabel Wentworth—Harry's temptation and his escape from it—The meeting with Silsby—The visit to Isabel —Bruce's, and brandy—The theatre—Our hero shut out—Washington Gardens—Meets Lynch and Mosley—His deeper degradation. About the time that Pierce and his sister left Mrs Prescott's shop for their Saturday twilight walk, Henry saw Silsby drive up in his stanhope in a dashing style that attracted the attention of all the customers in the store as well as the gaze of the passengers on the side-walk. He alighted, throwing his reins to his colored servant, who sat beside him, and, after lounging on the walk a moment to level his quizzing glass at two young ladies who were passing he entered the store.— Henry telt embarrassed with he knew not what feelings; but the apprehension that Silsby had come to ask him for the money he had lost at play, was uppermost. His confusion was so great that, in cutting off a yard of ribbon, he took up in his scissors a lace cape, in which he made a huge gap, utterly ruining it. Silsby's manner, however, at once relieved his fears. `How are you, Harefoot?' he said in a tone of condescension, extending to him the tip of his gloved finger; `I hope you are quite well after last night's spree.' The pride he began to feel at being addressed so familiarly by a rich young man who drove his own stanhope, was instnntly exchanged for distress and apprehension at the unlucky termination of the speech; and glancing round, to see if Stanhope or Tarfton, both of whom were near, heard him, he cast a warning, supplicating look at Silsby, and colored with the shame of conscious guilt. Poor Henry! He had begun already to conceal—which resort soon begets falsehood and duplicity. A single error never stands by itself. Guilt is a stone with a hundred superfices reflected in it—one object becomes a hundred. Innocence is a single mirror, in which truth is seen in all the loveliness of her aspect! `I have come to ask you, Harefoot,' said Silsby, speaking in a low tone, `if you will ride out to Milton to church with me to-morrow.' `I should be very happy to go,' said Henry, so relieved to find that he was not asked for money, and so proud to be thought on terms of intimacy with a young man worth a hundred thousand dollars. He felt, however, the next moment, a slight touch of his sadly treated conscience at consenting to ride on the Sabbath; but as it was to church he silenced it. Besides, he felt that he was in his power as his debtor, and a refusal might displease him. He also could not help feeling honored by the invitation, and his vanity was gratified as he glanced at the handsome stanhope, at the idea of riding out of town in such a fashionable style; and the hope that Pierce Wentworth might see him coming to his mind, led him to be desirous, even at the risk of acting against his sense of right, to go. Silsby then said he would call for him at his boarding house; but here Harry again had to resort to du plicity and concealment, fearing to have it known that he rode on the sabbath, lest it might be attributed to a pleasure ride; forgetting the excellent maxim that one should never do what appears wrong. He therefore proposed to call at the Exchange, and start thence. With this arrangement Silsby took his leave, sprang into his stanhope, and dashed down Washington street towards his stable. Thus, by courting the society of rich and business young men, because he conceived he should be thought more genteel for his acquaintance, our hero had been led first to depart from his usual custom of going directly home after shutting up; to engage in cards; to drink intoxicating beverage; to gamble; to indulge in champaigne; to incur debts; to spend the hours till midnight in the worst kind of dissipation; to knock down a watchman, and pass the night, instead of at home in his humble bed in peaceful repose, at a hotel, in sleepless, feverish remorse, the next day to resort to concealment and duplicity; and morally to surrender his independence to those whom, having become under obligations to, he feared to displease. All these reflections passed through his mind, and he groaned inwardly, and wished heartily that he could recall the last three days.— It is not the one vice that it is so dangerous, but those that are connected with it. It is not the link attached to the iron bands of the prisoner, but the links that are beyond—the lengthening chain that weighs him to the earth! `I was not aware you knew that young gentleman,' said Stanwood gravely. `I met him by accident! Your friend Edward Lynch introduced him to me.' `Lynch is not my particular friend, Henry,' said Frank quickly; `nor should I advise you to make him yours. As for this young man who first went out, he is no associate for a clerk—or for any young man who values his character.— Mr. Cushiug would not be pleased to know you associated with him.' Harry was vexed. He was conscious of having been doing wrong, and, feeling he could not defend himself, was annoyed by his friends open reproof, and replied angrily— `It appears to me, Stanwood, you take upon yourself too much to dictate to me as to my acquaintances. I don't know that I am any worse than you. You envy me Silsby's acquaintance.' `No, I do not,' answered Stanwood calmly; `he is not a young man I would associate with. I should feel disgraced to be seen walking the streets with him.' `How a young man who is so rich, who drives in such style, and lives in such splendor, can hurt any body I don't know! Perhaps you don't like sour grapes, Frank,' said Henry in a tone and with a manner more sarcastic than he had ever used before to any body. `I am sorry you judge me so, Harefoot,' he said quietly `I like you; you possess a great many noble qualities and fine traits; but there is a weakness in your character, which, unless you guard against it, I fear will prove a serious evil to you. I speak in friendship. This you know is my last day with Mr Cushing, and Monday you are to take my place; and I should be sorry to have you led into temptation while holding such a position in Mr. Cushing's confidence.' `I beg, Stanwood, you will not be alarmed,' said Henry laughing; `I shall not disgrace your post.' `I sincerely hope and believe not; but I felt it my duty to caution you against cultivating an intimacy with Silsby.' Mr. Cushing now coming out, stopped and said in a tone of singular kindness— `Well, Francis, so we are to part, and Monday you go with Mr. Rice. I need not advise you as to your duty there, for you have always faithfully performed it here. Come and see us often, and when you go to Roxbury call and visit my house. Good evening. So, Harry, you are now promoted,' he said turning to Harefoot and smiling; `I hope you will take your friend Francis here for your model, and prove yourself worthy of the confidence I place in you. Good evening young gentlemen.' Thus speaking, Mr. Cushing left the store and got into his chaise, which awaited him at the door, and rode out to his house. Stanwood soon afterwards left, resigning his duties to Henry, reiterating his kind advice, and giving him instructions on the duties of his new situation. Mr. Cushing did not keep open after seven, Saturday evenings, for the same reasons which led Mr. Libby to quit work two hours before sunset, to give his clerks time to attend to any thing which they ought not to do on the Sabbath, and so tempt them to break it. So without lighting up, when the clock struck, Mr. Martin gave orders to shut up, and immediately went away followed by Tarfton, leaving Henry for the first time in charge.— Shutting the door and giving the keys to Walter, Henry was proceeding at a listless pace homeward, yet loth to go, for he felt he should, under his present feelings, shrink from the loneliness of his chamber, where, before his last night's temptation, he had passed so many happy evenings reading; but now he felt he could not sit down and read. He was restless with a sense of guilt that he could not banish, and which seemed to call for the excitement, bustle and life of the streets. So he kept along Washington street, looking into the lighted shops of jewellers, confectioners, and dry goods merchants. All at once a hand was laid upon his arm, and a female voice that made his blood course like lightning through his veins said softly, while her arm was put confidentially through his— `You walk alone, Henry! won't you have company?' He needed not to turn round to know that the beautiful glove-purchaser was by his side. For a moment he was silent with the pleasure of the surprise, and insensibly pressed the hand she stole into his. The emotions of joy were, however, instantly shadowed by a thought of his mother's caution—the reflection that he knew nothing of the lovely shopper. But he was too much pleased at meeting her, in his present gloomy mood, to let such reflections remain in his mind, and quickly banishing them, wilfully crushing them, he resolved not listen to them; for his former falls had weakened his resolutions of virtue and blunted his sense of moral duty. In a word, he was captivated by her beauty, and reckless of the danger (the idea of which he drove from his mind) willingly surrendered himself to its fascinating influence. He replied in a tone of passionate admiration, adding, `Such happiness I did not believe was in store for me. I was expecting to see you to-day, but was disappointed.' `Disappointed,' she replied, looking archly; `I wonder how you should presume to expect me.' `Indeed, I cannot say,' he answered, confused by her question; `but I have thought of you so frequently, that I somehow imagined—' `I might think of you. Well, I have. I came down just now to purchase that lace, (for I have brought my purse) but saw you just quitting your store, and so I thought I would take the liberty to ask you to escort me home as it is evening.' `With the greatest pleasure,' answered Henry, from whose mind this explanation removed all suspicions of her being one of those dangerous persons his good mother had warned him of; `where do you reside?' `I will show you. But do you ever go into confectioners!' she said, detaining his arm to glance into Peverilly's. The question reminded him of a courtesy he thought de to her, and he invited her in. They took their seats at a retired table in the father corner of the apartment, and toes, cakes, and other refreshments was brought to them. Here they conversed for a long time, during which she exerted all her powers of enchantment, and as love helped her, when at length she proposed departing, he rose be wildered and prepared for the sacrifice of all that honor and virtue hold dear in the heart of youth. Yet he knew not that he was so near temptation, for he believed her pure as she was lovely. To his mortification he found he had not money enough to pay for what he had, and was searching in his pockets, perspiring with shame, when she said in the tone of a sister, `I have change. Henry,' and gave him her purse. Looking both mortified and grateful, he took from it the amount he needed to eke out his own. As he was doing so, Stanwood entered with Isabel Wentworth leaning on his arm and laughingly conversing, while Peirce walked on the other side by her. Conscious of his ignorance of the true character of his companion, and surprised at seeing Stanwood in such company and being seen by him with a stranger on his arm, he felt very much confused; but seeing Frank glance from him to the glove-puschaser with an inquisitive and suspicious look, he felt angry, and haughtily returning his nod, and without daring to meet the eyes of the others, he watked out of the shop.— He proceeded a few minutes in by no means an enviable condition of mind. He had exposed his want of money to the fair stranger, and had been seen by his friends in doubtful company; and if he was asked who she was, how could he answer! He also felt—he could not answer to himself wherefore—annoyed to know that Stanwood was acquainted with Isabel; and how he should have become so, as well as with her brother, and then should be walking so publicly with them into the most genteel confectioner's rooms in the city, was a matter of surprise and vexation to him; the reader, however, who knows where Peirce and Frank first met, will only have to be told, to account for their second meeting, that Stanwood encountered them ie the mall on his way home after leaving the store, and having been introduced by Peirce to his sister, became so much interested in her as to join them in their walks; and that in returning to Mrs. Prescott's, who kept not far from Peverrilly's on the opposite side, they had by his invitation gone in to partake of some of the delicacies that were so temptingly displayed to allude the passer-by. After they had gone out Stanwood, who had been struck with something familiar in the countenance of Harefoot's beautiful companion, succedded in recollecting that he had seen her some weeks before riding with Morley on Sunday in from Roxbury. This was not proof that she was a female of bad character, but it was in his mind presumptive evidence; and sighing at the moral weakness of his friend, he turned to relieve his sadness on account of Harry, to bask in the sunshine of Isabel Wentworth's bright eyes. He escorted her with her brother to Mrs. Prescott's, and when he bade her good night, and the door had closed upon her, he felt that unless he soon saw her again he should be very unhappy. So thought Isabel of him, and wondered so excellent a young man should hear the character Henry had given him. Arm in arm Wentworth and he continued their walk, talking as intelligent young men do on first acquaiutance, about feeling and sensations, and of the bright hopes and buoyant anticipations of the future. As Peirce was engaged to call on Mr Cunningham with his drawing, they first went to Mr Libby's, where he introduced Stanwood to the retirement of his little study-chamber; and from thence they went to Mr Cunningham's, where Stanwood took his leave, it being then just eight o'clock. Harry, when he got out doors, did not fail to apologise to his fair companion for not having his purse with him, and thanked her for her aid. `O, we are quits now,' she said, laughing.— `Who was that handsome young man who bowed to you, with the pretty girl on his arm?' `His name is Stanwood, a fellow-clerk.' `I hope you don't know her?' she said half-playfully, half seriously. `She is only a milliner's girl,' he answered, not wishing so respectable a young lady to know that he had any such acquaintances. `But you have not told me where you live, that I may know what street to take.' `Oh, this way—up Winter street;' she answered, turning from the crowded thoroughfare. They entered the Mall, and left it opposite the State House, and took the way Morley had before taken, and at length entered the court at the extremity of which stood her house. `You see we live retired, but it is my mother's choice,' she said as they came to the door. The house looked respectable, so far as he could see in the night; and he was satisfied that the young lady was genteel, though he thought she had been something tenderer in her conversation with him than became a truly modest girl; but this he referred to her admiration; for she had confessed that she was half in love with him—a dangerous confession for a young man to listen to from the lips of any pretty female. `You will come in,' she said winningly; `I cannot let you go without resting yourself a moment.' `No I thank you,' he said—the idea of her true character being suddenly suggested to her mind. `But you must, Henry,' she said, taking his hand and pressing it. `Indeed you will not refuse me.' `Tell me who you are?' he said earnestly. `I have told you my name was Ellen—that I love you—and that if you leave me you will make me wretched. Do not be so cruel! For one moment come in.' Bewildered, blinded, half resisting, half yielding as temptation struggled with his fears and suspicions, he suffered her to lead him into the hall and close the door. Without giving him a moment for reflection, she led him into the voluptuously furnished apartment in which Mosley had first discovered her to us. It was already brilliantly lighted and arranged, as if decked for the hour and the victim. Henry would have retreated with natural embarrassment on discovering that it was a sleeping apartment, but she drew him to a seat, laughing at his confusion. For a moment he stood in the attitude of one uncertain whether to fly or remain! It was a moment of suspense. Her arm gently enfolded him—her lips sought his—when the image of his mother rose to his memory, and disengaging himself, he sprang from her and fled—fled from the room—fled from the hall—from the house—and stopped not till the wide Common was beneath his feet, and the broad starry heavens stretched above him, in that sublime silence which is so awful to the eye of guilt. `Thank God, I have escaped! I can breathe! I am out of the close streets and on the free ground, and can see heaven, and realize that there is there a judgment-seat to which I am accountable! To what verge of ruin have I been led?— Can such loveliness hide a heart of lust? Could I have believed it? I more than once suspected it; yet was so dazzled and entranced that I willingly suffered myself to be led on. The memory of my mother's words alone saved me from the last and most fearful temptation of youth. God be thanked, I have not yielded to lust. I will go home and humble myself, and reflect upon my past follies, and try to repent, and to-morrow I will lead a new life. Oh, that I should be so weak! Yet she is beautiful! I will go nigh her no more! Yet she is so lovely and good tempered, and so— But no—I will not think of her. Yet I feel I must. And now, as I walk homeward, my irresolute heart is turning and lingering, as if it would go back whence I have escaped. God deliver me from temptation! I will not ride with Silsby tomorrow.' The sound of music from the Washington Gardens came pleasantly to his ear; and thinking music might soothe him in his present unhappy state of mind, he sought the temptation he had just prayed against, and walked slowly in that direction. He discovered, by the light of the lamp, Silsby coming out of the Gardens; when remembering his new resolution, he crossed the street to him to excuse himself. `Ah, Harefoot! the very man, I wanted to see! I have just been in the Gardens looking for you!' he said, as Henry came near and called him by name. `I did not expect, when I saw you this afternoon, that I should be at leisure this evening, but I am, and want you.' `I have crossed the street to say to you, Mr. Silsby, that I should rather be excused to-morrow.' `Poh, nonsense! I suppose you think I am not going to church with you! But you must go, my boy. I've said so—and what Bob Silsby, says, must be so, you know.' `But—' `But has nothing to do with it—you must go, and no but about it,' said Silsby, authoritatively. `Come, it isn't every store clerk I'd ask to ride.' Henry felt his resentment rising, but he remembered that he was his debtor, and said quietly, `Well, I will go.' `But I'll excuse you if you will introduce me to that pretty milliner from your town, Mosley says you know. I was after you to-night for the very purpose.' Harry knew he meant Isabel, and for a moment was uncertain how to act. Of Silsby's motive in seeking her acquaintance, he had no hesitation in forming an opinion. He felt he could not be instrumental in any wrong like that he meditated, and deliberately and firmly refused. `Why not?—is she any thing to you, Harefoot?' he asked, surprised to have his wishes disregarded by any of his associates. `No—but I cannot do it. She is an innocent girl.' `Look you, Harry—I don't want any boy's play. You know you are in my debt. I don't like to remind you of it—but introduce me, and I will square accounts.' This was a temptation, as he well knew he had no honest means of paying him, and the debt annoyed him. He therefore, we are sorry here to record, consented. To pay a gambling debt, he stooped so low as to degrade himself by introducing a dissolute rake to a young and innocent girl whose ruin he knew was his object. Coward, that weakness and guilt had made! he purchased his own freedom by sacrificing Isabel Wentworth! Besides, he had a motive for wishing to see her. She had taken off her hat and shawl, and thrown them upon a chair when she went in, and immediately passed through into the shop. There she went to work to complete a hat that was to be done for a lady, who said to Mrs. Prescott that she must have it that night, no matter if it kept her apprentice up till Sunday morning. And her words Mrs. Prescott repeated to Isabel, saying, `You see, dear, how little feeling many of the rich and fashionable have for those whom they employ! I have been surprised, in my experience, that woman with such unfeeling hearts should be prospered so. It seems to me the richer and more stylish people are, the less heart they have; and I am sorry to say that their being members of a church don't make much difference.— This lady who gave this order is not only a member of the church, but of all the benevelent societies. Well, my child, I hope you will always be poor and humble, if riches and gentility are to make you proud and heartless. `I can finish this bonnet by nine o'clock, with ease,' said Isabel cheerfully; and lightly she went to her task. She had been at work but a few moments— thinking of the handsome young gentleman, Frank Stanwood, who bore so bad a character, and feeling very sorry—when Harry and Silsby entered. Her face beamed with a flush of pleasure, and rising, she met him, and frankly offered her hand. Ashamed of himself, yet urged forward by a characteristic weakness which led him so often astray, he introduced Silsby as his `particular friend.' Mrs Prescott being present, he was constrained in his conversation with Isabel, but talked so much with the old lady, and made so many purchases of her, paying in gold and silver, that she was quite taken up with him. `How did you know that young Stanwood?' asked Harry, aside of Isabel. `Brother introduced him to me this evening, when I was walking out with him.' `Where did Pierce become acquainted with him?' he asked earnestly. `At Mr Cunningham's, in Summer street.' `That is one of the first families in Boston,' repeated Henry, with surprise; `how came he there?' `By invitation. He is to spend this evening there also. Mr Cunningham likes his drawings of buildings, I believe.' `Humph! he is looking high,' said Harry, with envious feelings. `I shouldn't wonder if he was invited to David Sears' next.' `That is the very gentleman's name who took him through his house in Beacon street, and treated him so kindly, and invited him to come often,' said Isabel in an artless manner. `Then I had best change my coat for a jacket and apon,' he said contemptuously, not able to conceal his chagrin. `Ah, Harry, Harry,' said Silsby, approaching, `that won't do! leant have you tete-a-tete with the pritty girls! You must beware of him, Miss Isabel—he is a dangerous young man.' `I have known Mister Harefoot a good many years,' said Isabel, whose feelings had been touched by Harry's word and manner, `and never discovered any thing very dangerous in him.' The tone in which this was said piqued our hero, who was too sensitive to take railing kindly; and bidding her abrubtly a good night, he left, taking Silsby with him. The intelligence he had received from Isabel, as well as the spirit of her retort, was not a little vexations; and this, added to a painful sense of degradation for what he had done, made him feel that spirit of singular recklessness which sometimes comes over the heart when every thing goes wrong, coupled with a sense of guilt; and he was almost tempted to give himself up for that evening to a perfect abandon, and at a blow dash his resolutions of penitence to the ground. He struggled against it, yet felt little relief. `Silsby, I feel badly,' he said; `I wish I had never seen Boston.' `What is the matter, boy?' `I have lost all self-respect! I revolt at myself! I loathe life!' You have got the blues! Suppose we step into Bruce's, and take something.' `It is that that first ruined me, I feel!' he said sadly `Then it will help you! Come, you shall drink. I can cure you.' O'Bruce's `soda fountain head' was not far off, and they soon reached it. Brandy and water was brought to their table, and though Harry objected to drinking it, Silsby insisted so strongly that it would make him feel better, that he yielded.— He soon did feel better—the heaviness of guilt was removed, and a gaiety which was not clogged by one qunce of moral restraint, took its place. Glass after glass followed, and when Silsby proposed to go to the Theatre, Harefoot hailed the proposal with an oath of pleasure, and together they took their way down through Franklin Square, and entered the Theatre. Henry was just intoxicated enough to be bold, reckless, and indifferent to observation. Under the guidance of Silsby, he was soon initiated into all parts of the house. In the third tier he encountered Morley and Lynch, who almost hugged him on meeting him there, and called Silsby the cleverest of follows. Here our unhappy young hero found himself in society as new to him as it was agreeable to the present excited state of his brain. Yet all through the scenes with which he mixed, he carried a weight at his heart—the leaden weight of a crushed conscience. This kept him from plunging deeper into sin, and under its influence he resisted the gresser temptations that he otherwise might fallen a prey to! He had refused to drink after coming into the Theatre, and before its close he had so far come to himself as to feel all the horrors of his fall. He withdrew frow his associates into a dark recess of the gallery lobby, and tears—tears of bitter remorse of conscience— flowed like rain from the eyes of this erring young man. He felt like kneeling and rerolving solemnly to stop and proceed no furthes in vice. Under the influence of these feelings, he stole from the Theatre and got into the street. The moon was up. The clock had just struck eleven, and after quitting the noisy, bright-glowing, carriage-thronged precincts of the Theatre, he found the streets silent. He walked homeward without looking at the moon, which he had so often gazed upon with a pure heart. His guilty bosom shrunk from the light, for his deeds were evil! He found his dwelling closed; the bright moon silvering its front and laying in broad plates upon the pavement of the yard. No sound was heard —the neighborhood was still—sleep seemed to have fallen like a mantle upon the groups of houses. He was awed. Softly he approached the door—it was fast! He walked to the back of the house, and there all was secure. Unwilling to rouse the family, with a heavy heart and sighing for the peaceful hours he once knew, he bent his steps up the street which led in the direction of the Common. With a listless walk he traversed the long avenue of elms, moving half the time in broad light, half the time in broad shadow, as the moonbeams were parted and broken by the huge trunks and arms of the trees. He kept on to the head of Winter street, when the dim light over the gate of the Washington Gardens attracted him, and houseless and wandering, he bent his steps intuitively thither. The Garden was open, and he entered. Laugher and noise drew him in the direction of the bar-room—for the garden part or the establishment was closed, the drinking room alone being open. He looked in through a glass door, and recognized Lynch with a party of young men. Wishing to flee from his loneliness, he opened the door and entered. Mosley and Lynch both met him, and he was introduced all round; and as they already had glasses in their hands, drinking, he was compelled to join them. His companions said they had hunted for him at the Theatre, and now rallied him for taking the start of them for the purpose of taking a carriage home with some one. He laughed, and let it pass as they surmised, without being angry at the imputation, as he had before been. So soon does indulgence in vice deaden the sensibilities to moral evil!—so soon does virtue become a thing to be ashamed of, and vice something so desirable as to be suspected of it, coveted. `I have found you out at last, Harry, eh?' said Mosley, taking his arm and walking aside with him. `Well, I am glad of it, as we shall understand each other. Only be careful and secret, so that Cushing shall not find you out, and you will do bravely. Where are you going from the Gardens?' `I find my boarding-house shut up, and thought of asking Silsby for a lodging.' `No, come with me,' said Lynch; `I get in at all hours.' And this point being settled, Henry felt relieved, for he believed he should have had to wander in the streets all night. He remained in the Gardens till after twelve, and then, in company with a dozen young clerks all comfortably primed for a frolic, sallied forth—the party amusing themselves and the neighbors with rapping their sticks upon the board fences, yelling at intervals like an Indian, singing uproariously a stave of an old song, and upsetting such boxes as lay exposed on the side walk, into the gutter. Without disturbing any watchmen, or meeting any other adventure than having a pail of water poured on their heads from the upper story of the Marlborough Hotel—which was too fast secured for them to enter and punish the offender, as Harry made some demonstrations of doing—they arrived each at his destination in safety; and one hour of the Sabbath had passed ere our hero was in bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. Pierce meets with Mary Boardman—A pleasant evening—A miserable morning and the first glass of bitters—The ride to Fresh Pond—The Sabbath desecrated by Henry—The box in the Gardens—The final temptation and fall of our hero —The consequences—Is dismissed from Mr. Cushing's—His distress—Ellen Emery's devolion—Assassination of a Watchman—The bank robbery—The discovery—The unhappy termination of our hero's career—The happy result of Pierce's upright life—Concluding reflection. The evening Henry Harefoot had passed so erringly was most agreeably spent by Pierce Wentworth. When he entered the library at Mr. Cunningham's, with his drawings beneath his arm, what was his surprise at discovering seated at a table there, looking at prints, Mary Boardman. He stood still with the door-knob in his hand, with surprize and embarrassment; colored and for a moment was so confused that he could not reply to Mr. Cunningham's salutation. On her part the little Kennebec maiden, who knew that he was coming, rose up, and blushing like a rose, frankly extended her hand. `Why, Miss Mary, when did you come to Boston?' he at length asked with eyes beaming with pleasure. `This morning only, and left all well at home.' `But that I should meet you here!' `Mary is my niece, Mr. Wentworth,' said Mr. Cunningham, whose quick penetration had discovered their partiality for each other; `she has come to stay with me two years to complete her education.' `Then I shall see you often,' spoke Pierce, warmly; but the next moment confounded at his open betrayal of his interest in her. Mary dropped her dark eyes, and said, in a low voice, `I hope so, Pierce.' The evening glided away on wings of silver. The young friends had many opportunities to converse over the drawings, Mr. Cunningham having letters to write and too busy to give his whole attention to them. They talked of home, of their schoolmates, of the pleasant walks by the river side; and when Pierce inquired after the baby house he had built for her, she laughed, and confessed she had brought it with her to Boston! Young ladies in their sixteenth year are not apt to care much for baby-houses; but we suppose Mary had a very good reason which lay deep in the bottom of her heart for not wishing to part with hers. When Pierce left at half past nine, he felt as he reflected upon the events of the evening, that unless he could look forward one day to marry Mary Boardman, he should be very unhappy. What Mary's thoughts were, cannot be told; but she dreamed that night how Pierce came to her and told her she must come and see a much finer house than the toy one, which he had been building for her; and that he led her to a magnificent mansion of great size, furnished throughout in a most sumptnous manner; and said to her, `This, is the house which I have built for you, Mary, and it is your bridal present!' The ensuing day was the Sabbath. Henry awoke heavy and feverish. He found himself in Lynch's chamber instead of his own, and all the scenes of the past night rushed upon him. He groaned audibly. Never had the hallowed Sabbath morning found him so wretched. The consciousness that it was the Sabbath, added to his remorse. `What is the matter, Harefoot? You look as if, you would commit suicide,' said Lynch, seeing his sad countenance upon which was fixed an expression of mental suffering. `I am miserable—wretched! I feel like the veriest wretch that breathes!' `Come, come, cheer up, I have a cure for such a sick mind? something that will clear away your fogs and make all sunshine!' `Then let me have it in heaven's name,' answered the unhappy young man. Lynch went to his closet and returned with a decanter and a wine glass, which he filled with a strong decoction of rum and wormwood—a private store, to which almost every morning, on account of his nights' excesses in drinking he was compelled to resort. Henry knew it was spirit; but that nice moral sense which in his first temptation had held him back from the cup, was now in a manner lost! Anxious to find relief from the horrors his mind endured, he took it and drank it without a word. Thus he got to seek relief in the drunkard's morning doom! Poor Henry! he was fast falling. He dressed and walked out with Lynch to breathe the fresh air of the Common. It was one of those bright sunshiny Sabbath mornings which seem holy as if nature was hallowed with the day. All around him was peace and serenity. The low winds just lifted the golden autumnal leaves —birds were carrolling amid the branches, and fleecy clouds like heavenly barks were anchoredin the azure deep. But all so contrasted the gloom of his own bosom that he was made still more miserable; and excusing himself to Lynch on the plea of illness he left him at the head of West street and sought his boarding house. He slept till the church bells awaked him. But he felt in no mood to go to church! Every thing good would reprove him; and he was not penitent. They had ceased tolling and the feet resounding streets were silent when Silsby drove up and called for him. He did not panse to reflect. His coming was a relief to him; and though he knew Silsby was only going for a ride, he sprung into his Stanhope and were soon dashing along the fine avenue across teh neck. The ride cheered his spirits and he was never gayer. But it was the gaiety of recklessness. The reflection that he had been tempted to drink, to gamble, to take oaths, to attend the theatre, to associate there with the dissolute of both sexes, to break the sabbath—these and other offences against morals and virtue of which he had been guilty, no longer troubled his mind. He had fully succeeded in banishing these from his thoughts. He was hilarious and in excessive spirits. At the Suffolk House they stopped, and he invited Silsby to drink. Thence they proceeded, each with a lighted cigar in his mouth, to Fresh Pond, where they met a party of kindred spirits with whom they dined. After dinner, they bowled and otherwise amused themselves. Towards evening, Silsby and Henry took their Stanhope to return, and on the way raced with two Boston gigs, two miles. At sunset they reached the city; and leaving the Stanhope at the stable, Silsby pleaded an engagement and they parted. Slowly did the fallen young man take his way up School street, after his companion had left him. The manner in which he had spent that Sabbath day, now that he was alone, and the excitement had passed, cut him to the soul. He had been drinking a good deal, for every time conscience smote him he would drown it in the glass. He was angry too, for he had passed Stanwood in coming into town going out home with his mother in the family carryall. He was also well-assured others must have seen him. This reflection made him feel reckless of any future consequences. When he reached the corner of School street and Tremont by the King's Chapel, he stopped, undetermined where to go—for home now had lost its charm for him—and he hated to be alone. He wanted companionship. He thought of the Washington Gardens and thither bent his steps. It was already brilliantly lighted up. He entered and found it througed with visitors, as was usual, on Sabbath evenings. He walked round looking for Lynch or Mosley or some one whom he knew, when he discovered Ralph seated in a box, in conversation with a female who was veiled. He instantly approached them. `Never tear,' said Mosley to her just before they were discovered; `he will soon come round. I expected some resistance. To-day he has gone out of town with Silsby, who has taken a real liking to him, and who by the by, will also lend him money if he asks him, which he will yet have to do—and this we share too!' `I would not think of him,' said the voice of Ellen Emery, after he ran away from me so rudely, if I did not really feel attached to him. The truth is, Ralph, I love him, which I feel I never did you.' `Perhaps he will be fool enough to marry you,' said Mosley, laughing coarsely. `I should then be perfectly happy,' she said earnestly. `I may be unworthy of him—but you have made me so, and have no right to jest upon my degradation. If I should marry him he would never repent it.' `You girls are always thinking of one day marrying! I can't conceive how you can all be so blind to your utter downfall; yet I never talked with one of you, however dissolute, who had not some day a hope of marrying and living a virtuous life! ha, ha!' `You are totally hard-hearted, Mosley. I will leave you and return home alone, nor never walk out again with you. I have feelings, if I am fallen.' `You came with the hope of meeting with Harefoot, you well know, and not for my company. And there he is.' He has seen me.' `I don't wish him to know that you know me,' she said hurriedly, doubling her veil over her face. `I am to be your cousin, if be detects us. How are you, Harry? Come in and take a seat.— When did you get in town?' `Half an hour ago. I thought I should meet some of you here!' said Henry shaking him by the hand, pleased at finding any one who would help him to get rid of himself, with which personage he was on very bad terms. All the while he was in vain trying to discover who the female was. `What shall I order for you, Harefoot? We are drinking lemonades! Oh, beg your pardon! This is Miss Jones, Harry.' Henry bowed to her, but she did not unveil. `By the by, Harry, I saw you walking with a pretty cousin of mine last night in Washington street; I didn't know you knew her.' `Is Miss Emery your cousin?' asked Henry with surprise. `Yes. How do you like her?' `She is very beautiful—but—' `But an odd creature! Yes, I dare say you thought so. Ah, there is a fellow I want to see —excuse me a moment. Ellen you entertain him!' and Mosley abruptly rose and left them in the box together. Harry began to make a very pretty speech as if to a stranger, about the brilliancy of the gardens, when he was astonished by a merry laugh, the veil was raised, and he beheld Ellen Emery. He started with emotions of mingled pleasure and surprise, and then looked confounded. `Ah, you truant!' she said, playfully. Henry laughed, and took and pressed the hand she placed in the way of his. Since the last evening he had parted with that remnant of moral sense which had led him to fly. And he had fled, not then, from the purity of principle, but from the influence of a mother's warning, which virtue suddenly brought to her aid. But the manner in which he had passed the evening and night after leaving her—the way in which the Sabbath had been spent—had given the caup de grace to his morale. A half hour passed, during which time Henry forgot every thing but her who was by his side. Mosley did not return.— Carried away by the wild, turbid current of his be wildered passions, (for she had regained over him all her former power) when she proposed that he should escort her home, he yielded, shutting his eyes to the danger into which he knew he should plunge, and willfully consenting in his heart to break down forever the last barrier between him and virtue, though he had learned from her own lips that she was not Mosley's relative, and he was not so ignorant as not to be capable of judging her true character! But the die of his reputation was cast! he felt it was so; and instead of stopping on the brink, while honor, virtue and respectability were yet attainable, he desperately dashed forward to irretrievable ruin. The next morning Henry sought his store with the consciousness of having fallen as low as a young man could descend in vice. But he did nor would not reflect. His soul was fascinated with the thoughts of the syren who had completed his downfall. He felt himself now in the tide of dissipation, and he resolved to follow it, and to derive that pleasure from vice which virtue no longer held out to him. For several days he kept his dissipation secret from all save Stanwood, who, now that he had left the employ of Mr. Cushing, let him proceed without troubling him; though, had he known the extent of his fall, his upright sense of duty and love of truth would have led him to advise and warn him to reform, and in the alternative acquaint Mr. Cushing with his departure from the paths of virtue and moral rectitude. His knowledge, however, was only partial. `Henry, I wish you to give me fifty dollars, said Ellen, the third day after he had gone with her to her house, where he had spent each night since. `I don't know how I can give it to you,' he said with a troubled look. `You must take it from the bank book, and replace it by and by.' This suggestion did not startle him so much as it would have done, had it not been preceded by several minor propositions which he had yielded to; such as coaxing him to bring home and present her an elegant shawl, which after a struggle, in which his infatuation caused guilt to triumph, he secreted as he shut up, and brought to her, and such as abstracting gloves, lace, collars and silk! These requests be had yielded to, for his passion for her was in his present moral ruin stronger than any sense of right. But the suggestion to take money, and so large a sum made him turn pale. But he felt it was in vain to resist her!— He had already learned that the service of the devil is a hard one; and his demands not only become more and more heavy, but more and more imperative. He at length consented, and that night he brought her the money, and laid it in her lap. But fifty dollars will not go far, where it has to be shared with others; and Mosley and Lynch also participated in this. He had card parties privately at his rooms, and lost money to these friends. Ellen again came to him for money for the rent. He had his gambling debts to pay too. Two hundred dollars would be required to supply the requisitions upon his now empty purse. He told her bitterly that he knew not how to get it, and was daily in expectation of having the deficiency in the bank account discovered. Mosley, who was present, suggested a plan, and he followed it. That very night a handcart might have been seen at the door when he closed, which, after Walter had left, returning Henry the key, was filled with pieces of silk goods, which he reopened to take out. Following the handcart to a private receiver of such goods in Brattle street, he entered the back room of his shop, and delivering them, received two hundred and forty dollars for them, and left to seek the abode which had now become his home; giving it out that he had changed his boarding-house. Thus in the downward and fearful pathway that leads to destruction did this unhappy young man proceed, till suspicion led to a discovery of his habits by Mr. Cushing, who, not wishing to make public exposure of one who might yet be saved, dismissed him, and in charity for his parent's feelings, withholding in his letter to them upon the subject, the fact of his abstraction of money and goods, which, as he alone was the injured party, he kept to himself. We wish that we could say that this generous conduct of his employer had affected his heart and led to reformation. But this vice had sunken deep into his soul. This was six weeks after his fatal meeting with Ellen Emery and Mosley in the Washington Gardens. A month longer passed, and Mosley and Lynch, who were now also out of place, became desperate with their circumstances, which they had no idea of improving through Harefoot, who was now as low as they were. They, therefore, resolved to break into one of the banks; and as they knew the resolute and fearless nature of Harefoot, and knew that he now was living in daily fear of the jail, they determined to make him a party to their design. They found him with Ellen, living no longer in the handsome apartment he had first occupied, but occupying a garret room in Myrtle street, the lowest and vilest sink of wretchedness in the dissolute quarter of the city known as the `Hill.' Though he was destitute of resources and a fugitive from debt, Ellen Emery, still beautiful and fascinating, clung to the victim of her ruinous attachment, with a devotion and sympathy deserving the highest praise; for woman's love never perishes, though her soul may perish in its body in early youth.— She had parted with all her costly dresses and jewelry to relieve their necessities, and that morning had herself gone out when he feared to appear in the streets, and pawned her watch. When they proposed for him to join them, she would have persuaded him to refuse. `I am lost as I am, Ellen,' he said bitterly.— `Mosley you may depend on my co-operation. I feel now wholly reckless of results.' They then talked over with him their plans, and it was agreed upon that, as it was then Saturday, it would then be the best time to undertake the enterprize, as the robbery would not be detected, before Monday. In the meanwhile, Peirce Wentworth kept his humble course, and won friends by his virtues as well as respect for his genius and industry. Weekly he visited Mr. Cunningham, and his acquaintance with Mary assumed gradually a more direct and partial character. Stanwood had pursued his acquaintance with Miss Wentworth, and went so far as to persuade his mother to go with him and be introduced to her; who was so much pleased with her, that, greatly to Frank's delight, she invited her to come and visit her with Mrs. Bennett's permission; saying she would call by for her some day, and take out of town to her house. The visit was made, and Peirce and he rode out in the afternoon to bring herein. And as she had asked Frank why Henry had given him such a bad character, and he had explained to her that Mosley must have been meant, she had got quite over the little trouble which had lain so sorely at her heart. Silsby had visited her repeatedly, but with all his tact, eloquence, equipage and money, was unable to make any impression upon her, and as she was so modest in her looks, and so discreet in conversation, which she neither foolishly encouraged by laughter and signs of being flattered by his notice, as too many persons in her position do, he never could sum up impudence enough to insult her with any proposition, as she properly refused to walk, ride, or even cross to Peverrilly's to get a cream with him. He therefore abandoned his pursuit, and our heroine thus saved herself by that modesty and propriety of manner which to plainness gave a charm unspeakable, and which to beauty adds additional attraction. The attempt to rob the bank was made at midnight, and was unsuccessful; for a watchman, by some chance, kept in the vicinity of the side door, of which they had a false key, till the approach of day led them with deep curses to abandon it till the next night. At a little before twelve the following night the three left Harry's abode in company, Lynch with a dark lantern beneath his coat. `What did you take that butcher's knife and stick it in your bosom for?' asked Lynch of Ralph Mosley, as they skulked along through a by-lane to their destination. `To kill dogs,' answered the other, sullenly. Few words were spoken till they emerged from the lane in sight of the bank. `That accursed watchman is not there to-night,' said Harefoot; `let us move on.' `If he is, leave him to me,' said Mosley, in a low tone that startled them for its peculiar depth and significance of meaning. `You must do no murder, Mosley,' said Harefoot, placing his hand on his arm. Mosley threw it off, and the three moved across the street. They came near the door, and in the very shadow of the portal they discovered the watchman, and stopped before being discovered by him. They each gave vent to an expression of vindictive disappointment. `We are again defeated,' said Lynch between his clenched teeth. `If it is not done to-night it is never done,' responded Mosley. `Stand here, and when you see the way clear, come up.' Mosley then walked alone along the side-walk, and as he came near the watchman he began to whistle an air. The watchman left his place in the door and stood upon the walk. Mosley made as if he were going past him, and then stepping back, was seen by them to strike the man, who instantly fell with an indescribable cry. `He has murdered him! Let us fly,' cried Lynch, aloud. `No. Let us see! perhaps he has only knocked him down,' answered Harefoot; and they hurried towards him. The watchman lay upon his back across the curb-stone, his head in the gutter. `You have killed him!' said Harefoot, with horror. `I have done for him,' was the assassin's reply. `I'll teach him to poke about bank doors! Harefoot, you have the key; let us enter at once and get our money, and be off. I am not to lose it now you may be assured.' Without replying, and led on as it were by an evil destiny, Harefoot applied the key—the door yielded, and the three entered, closing the door behind them. The lantern was sprung, and Mosley led the way directly to the vaults. A false key unlocked the iron door, and exposed to their eyes the treasures within. Numerous packages of notes were transfered to false pockets they had provided in their coats for the purpose, and each filled a short bag with gold and silver. The time consumed in this transfer was not more than seven minutes, and re-locking the vault, they returned rapidly towards the door. Voices were heard on the outside, and they found that the body of the man had been discovered. From the conversation they overheard they learned that there was no suspicion of the bank having been entered, but that some one had struck him down in passing along the street. In a few minutes they were relieved by finding that they were carrying off the body; and in a few moments after, Harefoot, softly opening the door, saw the way was free. They instantly availed themselves of the liberty thus given them to quit the bank, and escape with their booty, which they did without detection. Elated with their success, they quite forgot the blood by which they had obtained it, and their congratulations of one another were enthusiastic, they poured out upon Harefoot's wretched bed the glittering coin. From Ellen they wished to keep secret the assassination, but Harry's indiscretion exposed it. `Boston is no place for us now,' said Mosley after they had divided their booty, each having for his share, Ellen making a fourth, eight thousand dollars, or thirty two thousand dollars in all. `We must leave for New York,' said Lynch, `in the stage to-morrow.' `Our absence will lead to suspicion,' said Harefoot; `I wish to God, Mosley, you had not killed that man.' `Killed?' shrieked Ellen. `Who has been murdered?' `Hush, will you, woman?' said Mosley, menacingly. Ellen sat trembling, and silent; while Harefoot observed that she dropped a roll of the notes that had been given her, with a look of horror. `If we stay here, we cannot live in the style we ought to, with our money; and the least show out will lead us to be suspected. Let us go to New York.' This step was decided on; and Lynch and Mosley, lying down upon their ill-gotten money in an adjoining closet, sought sleep; while Harefoot, too agitated to lay down, sat up with Ellen, who was bitterly regretting the blood that had been shed, but happy that it had not been by the hand of Henry. `Let us not cast our lot with these wretches,' she said, `but let them go to New York alone.— We will go into the country and purchase a farm and live there undisturbed.' `Save by conscience and remorse without hope,' he said, sarcastically. `Well, be it so. I will do whatever you say, Ellen,' he said, in a tone of helpless regret. As it was day, they waked the sleepers, who did not attempt to conceal their gratification at the proposal to seperate, as Mosley had no love for either of his victims, and Lynch feared that they might be discovered, in some way, through Ellen's means, if she was with them. So, after solemnly pledging to keep the secret of each others participation in the last night's work, they parted. That day Henry was married to Ellen, and they privately left the city the same evening. The career run by these depraved young men in New York was short, as it was distinguished for its extravagance. The murder of the watchman united with the robbery of the bank, created the greatest excitement throughout the city the morning after, and every means was taken to detect the perpetrators, both by the allurement of a large reward, and the diligence of the police. The simultaneous absence of Mosley, Lynch, and Harefoot, whom Stanwood had now long known to be quite depraved, with the commission of the robbery, led him to suspect their participation in it. He did not, however, mention his suspicions to any one but Pierce Wentworth, who with great reluctance and pain, was forced to acquiesce in his opinion. At length they learned through some one who knew them, that the two former were living in New York in dashing style. Frank felt it his duty to make known his suspicions, and this corroborative fact, to Mr. Cunningham, who was one of the directors of the bank which had been robbed. The gentleman immediately called on the Mayor, who instantly despatched police officers for that city; they arrested the young men in the third row of the Park Theatre, and brought them on to Boston. Lynch turned states' evidence, confessed the robbery and the assassination by the hand of Mosley, who was tried for his life, and condemned to be hung. Before his execution could take place he put an end to his own existence by strangling himself with the sleeve of his jacket; being found dead with it close knotted about his throat. Lynch left the community whose injustice he had so outraged, and went back to New York, where after living a year in the most degrading intemperance, he perished miserably by falling from the dock; and the only memento of his wretched end was contained in this account, taken from the Evening Post of June 7th, 1829: `The body of a young man, miserably clad, the features much bloated by intemperance, and without any thing about him to designate his name, was found floating in Peck slip this morning. He has been taken to the dead-house in the Park.' Those who visited the dead-house that day, recognized him only as a poor loafer they had seen about the wharfs; but no friend claimed the body and at night the last that remained of the fashionable, dissolute young cierk, was borne in the hospital hearse to the potter's field, and thrown by the hireling sexton into an unhonored grave. Thus miserably ended these young men there foolishly and wickedly spent lives, victims of false pride, of false notions of what is true respectability, and of indulgence beyond the outposts of duty and rectitude. How pitifully were they rewarded in the end for their nights of revel at the theatre and Washington Gardens, and other places of dissipation in which they conceived there was so much enjoyment, but whose end is death, moral and eternal. The evidence of Lynch which convicted Mosley, also implicated Harefoot, and dilligent search was made for him not only throughout the city but New York. Police officers in disguise even visited his father's house not only to discover their ignorance of his retreat but their anguish and remorse on account of his guilt. His excellent mother bore the shock with the fortitude of a Christian, and strove to live for the rest of her children; but death kindly took her from her woes in less than a year after Henry's disappearance from Boston. Mr. Harefoot felt deeply his son's degradation; but so long as he was not detected and imprisoned he felt great relief; and in the rush and whirl of business tried to forget he had ever had such a son. But what became of Henry Harefoot. Guided by the advice of Ellen, whom he voluntarily made his wife, for he felt he had now no one else to cling to in life, he that evening left the city in a chaise, which he hired and sent back from Salem, where he arrived at nine in the evening, and privately put up at a tavern. Here he learned a vessel was to sail the next day for Baltimore, on board of which he took passage. After six days they reached that city. They went on shore and put up at a second-rate tavern, in which Harefoot heard the subject of the Boston bank robbery and murder talked about and producing much excitement. The next morning he took the stage for Wheeling, and thence descended the Ohio to Cincinnati. Here he remained a few days in great privacy, and at length hearing of a farm at sale a few miles out of town, he went to see it, and at length purchased it, and moved upon it. It was a pleasant place, on the banks of the Ohio, and a neat dwelling, with every convenience attached to it. Here they settled down, he assuming the name of Foot, omitting the first syllable of his patronymic. But Henry soon found he had not fled from himself. There was hours in which he could not but reflect, and such hours were maddening to him. He had no hope. All was guilt and fear, and mental anxiety. His wife strove to remove the gloom that week after week seemed to be gathering over the soul; but in vain. He had no hope! Else he would have sought repentance— flown to the bible—flung himself upon that merciful Being who has said, `If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' But he was too proud of heart—and loved to hug his own self-wrought misery, as if it were atonement. Sleepless nights came, and then followed feverish days in which he wandered in the woods and in the house sat so still and voiceless, that Ellen began to fear his mind was giving way. One day he was abroad in a fearful tempest. Alarmed for him; in his present state of mind, she was going out to meet him when he came in with a countenance as pale as the face of the dead. `Ellen,' he said, `I can endure this no longer! I am going back to Boston to surrender myself for the robbery and murder.' `But you did not murder him, dear Henry,' she said soothingly. `I struck not the blow, but I was a partner in the deed. I suffered it! I profited by it! This house, this farm, all I have is bought with blood! Ha, ha! see! Look at the blood on that table! The chairs are turning to the hue of blood! The walls are streaming blood! See! it rains blood! `Oh, horrible! this is a fearful state of mind my Henry! You fancy this all! Banish such dreadful thoughts.' `See! Look!' he cried catching her finger and pointing it to the miaror before which he stood, `Do you not see that grim visaged man peered ouer my shoulder! It is the watchman I slew.' `Nay, you killed him not.' `I did in my heart, and God is cursing me! I knew Mosley would kill him! I knew he had the knife for the purpose, and yet I se much loved the money I did not interfere! I murdered him! see Ellen, he points to his gashed bosom! Yes, I did it! See, he bids me follow him! no, no, no! hsld me, Ellen. Let me not go!' he cried with the most heart-rending enpression of childish terror his whole form shaking so with her slight person she could barely support him; yet but for her support he would have fallen to the floor. But it is painful to dwell upon the first delineations of the insanity of remorse! The wretched young man was conveyed raving to his bed, and for weeks lay in a fever of delirium, during which he divulged the crime of which he had oeen guilty. The neighbors who watch with him, already looking with surprise upon his singular conduct before his attack, and being unconnected with either of them by any ties, were not backward in speaking of what he had divulged, and at length the intelligence of the robbery and murder being wide spread, it came to the ears of justice. But Henry was summoned to another and higher tribunal! Ellen had just seen him breathe his last, and was embracing his corpse, her lips glued in hopeless despair to his, as if she would hold him by her own life to life, when the officers of justice came in. They surveyed the dead in silent disappointment and then left the house, as they had no instructions to arrest his wife, though the justice knew from Lynch's published confession which he had procured, of her share in the bootp obtained. Finding the principal beyond his power, he issued a warrant for her arrest. But the wretched girl in the death of her husband, had severed the only tie that bound her to the world, which to her had been one of deception, guilt, and errors. No sooner had the officers quitted the house, then she rose and poured out into a glass an ounce of laudanum, and then kneeling a moment in silent anguish and woe unutterable, the expression of which distorted her pale and beautiful features, she laid dowe by his sids, and with one hand in his, another laid on his stilled heart, she soon sunk into that deep and pulseless sleep that knows no waking! Turn we to a more cheerful aspect of our tale, dear reader! Pierce Wentworth in his twentieth year, at which age Henry Harefoot so miserably perished, was given his freedom, and Mr. Cunningham sent him to Italy and Greece to study architecture in its own birth-land. After two years absence he returned, and the following year was united to Mary Boardman. They are now living in England, he one of the most distinguished architects of the age, she the most charming woman in the noble circle which includes princeses within its periphery. Mr. Francis Stanwood at the age of twenty-one, entered into business for himself in Milk street as an importer, and soon after married the beautiful Isabel Wentworth, who, after having remained one year with good Mrs. Prescott, and learned her trade, returned home, and went three years to the Cony Academy, where she became as accomplished in mind as she was amiable in heart and lovely in person. They are living now upon Mount Vernon street, and Frank is already worth seventy thousand dollars. Mr. Pierce Wentworth built the house he lives in for Mary as a `bridal gift;' and they lived there until he was invited to Europe, to plan and superintend the erection of a royal residence, now in progress. Mr. Stanwood had purchased the house of him on his departure, and now dwells there; his widowed mother living with him, a pensioner on filial love and duty, in ease, competence, and serene domestic enjoyment Mr. Cunningham still lives, a fine specimen of the Boston gentleman of the old school. Mr George Washington St John Leighton, who has once or twice done us the honor to appear in our pages, has for some years dwelt in Paris, America being `too parvenu forah gentelmanah of fashionah, demme-ah!' Mr. Libby has purchased a handsome farm not many miles out of town, on which he has erected a very elegant and tasteful dwelling house, where after a useful and laborious life, he is passing his green old age alternately in healthful industry and calm repose. We have now ended our story. Its incidents and scenes have mostly been taken from actual life. The moral we wish to convey, we trust will not fail to hit the mark at which we level it, which marks every young man in situations of employment like those held respectively by Henry Harefoot and Pierce Wentworth has set up in his own bosom. We write this story for the improvement—if we may aim so high—of the youth of New England, who enter life either over the mechanics bench or the counter. It is for them it is written, and to them it is most affectionately dedicated by the author, who, if he is hereby instrumental by holding up the mirror to vice, and exposing her deformity to those she could tempt from her seductive paths, will feel that he is well repaid for the time he has devoted to a subject so deeply interesting to every parent and son, as that of the temptation of a city. Its three temptations are wine, the play, and the grosser pleasures of sense; and these are so dependant and connected, that for a young man to yield to one, is almost always to yield to all three, with all their ramifications, as illustrated by the career through a successive series of temptations and falls of Harry Harefoot. To the youth, then, who seeks to enter life through the untried paths of a city, let him bear in mind and bind to his heart the words of one who well knew both the weakness of the youthful heart and the strength of its temptations. `Let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.'— `Ponder the paths of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.' THE END.</field>
