      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. CAROLINE ARCHER Was the most beautiful milliner's apprentice that tripped along the streets of Philadelphia. She was just seventeen; with the softest brown hair, that would burst into a thousand ringlets over the neck and shoulders, all she could do to teach it to lay demurely on her cheek, as a milliner's apprentice should do. Her eyes were of the deepest blue of the June sky after a fine shower, not that showers often visited her brilliant orbs, for she was as happy-hearted as a child, and to sing all day long was as natural to her as to the robin red-breast—at least it was until she became a milliner's apprentice, when she was forbid to sing by her austere mistress, as if a maiden's fingers would not move as nimbly with a cheerful carol on her tongue. Her smile was like light, it was so beaming; and then it was so full of sweetness, and gentle-heartedness! It was delightful to watch her fine face with a smile mantling its classical features, and her coral lips just parted showing the most beautiful teeth in the world. One could not but fall in love with her outright at sight— yet there was a certain elevated purity and dignity about her that checked lightness or thought of evil in relation to her. Caroline Archer was the daughter of the widow of a highly respectable merchant, who died during the cholera season. After his death he was found to be insolvent, and from affluence and comfort, Mrs. Archer became poor and dependent on her own exertions.— Possessing native energy of character and inspired to exertion by the necessity of providing for four children, the eldest of whom, our heroine Caroline, was but nine years of age, she collected a remnant of furniture, and tenanted a small but neat house in an obscure street in the rear of Arch street. Here she eked out a little pittance which she had saved from the sale of her jewelry, by taking in sewing from mantua-makers and milliners, and by needle and worsted-work, which she disposed of when completed at the usual depositories for such articles. Thus by great care, prudence and industry, she was enabled to clothe and educate Caroline and the three boys, and even to save up four hundred dollars, which she placed at interest in the Saving's Bank. Caroline at length reached her fifteenth year, and at that age gave promise of the loveliness that we have described her as possessing. Her mother now looked forward to the time when she should become a governess, for for that station had she been educating her, and between hope and fear was now about to draw upon the little means she had husbanded for this very purpose, and place her under a music and French master. It was at this period that the pecuniary tornado burst upon the land; and the very morning she would have gone to the bank, in which she had deposited her little earnings, she learned that the institution had become bankrupt and worthless. She had lost her all! Without a murmur, for she was a Christian, and true Christianity had taught her to school her heart to the teachings of adversity, she banished her ambitious hopes for her child for ever from her breast, and placed her, the very day on which she had learned her adversity, as an apprentice to a miliner and mantua-maker in Walnut street. At the period of our story Caroline had been nearly two years an apprentice, during which time sorrow and maternal anxiety had undermined her mother's health so far that she was unable to contribute longer to the support of her family, the care of which now devolved on this noble girl. All day she laboured at her needle in the little back parlor of the shop. Her task done, she hastened home through the twilight to attend to the domestic duties of her little family. After her brothers were a-bed, she would sit by the wasting invalid and toil till midnight over her sewing to earn an additional sum to purchase for her those little comforts so grateful to the sick. Her brothers, thanks to the munificent school system of the city, were taught daily at the public school without expense, and, save the homely provision for their table, they were happy and well enough off. Caroline alone bore all the burden of toil and anxiety. Yet she shrunk not from it, but unweariedly, with a cheerful temper and a light heart, gave herself a willing sacrifice to her filial affection. Woman in adversity rise into the angel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. MRS. Emily Wharton was the most charming bride that had been led to the altar, in Philadelphia, during the winter of 1838. Her husband, Percy Wharton, was a young gentleman of fortune, just from his travels in Europe, where he had first seen his future bride. They were a noble pair, and nature as well as fortune had made them worthy of each other. Percy was generous, high-spirited, and the soul of honorable feeling. Travel had not spoiled, but improved him. It had elevated his character, and given him a healthy knowledge not only of mankind but of himself. He was amiable to a fault, and not less distinguished for the quiet, gentlemanly tone of his manners, than for his learning and good sense. Emily—how shall I describe her? Let the reader imagine the loveliest young bride he or she had ever beheld, and they will form some notion of the exquisite grace and beauty of Mrs. Emily Wharton. But, then, this lovely young bride must have hair, black as the raven's wing, and eyes, dark as midnight, with long shadowy lashes, just subduing, not veiling their brilliancy. She should have a complexion something between a Spanish girl's and a blonde, but more favoring the Spanish, with dark, arched brows, contrasting, but, harmonizing, with a pleasing forehead not so white as Parian marble, but softer and far more beautiful. She should have an exquisite profile—not Grecian—not Italian—but American —that lovely, delicate outline of the face so peculiar to beautiful American females, which possesses all the regular chisseling of the Grecian beau ideal without its hardness. Her nose, too, should be the least bit in the world retrousse, and with the most charming mouth she should have a sweet, sparkling smile, which should display a set of the most brilliant teeth that ever gave richness to the smile of beauty. Such was the face of Emily Wharton. Her figure was moulded like that of a youthful goddess, superb and Juno-like. She dressed with perfect taste, which, altogether, united with her beautiful face, won for her the praise of being the finest and most lovely shaped woman in Philadelphia. She was clever (in the English sense) without being a blue, and her conversation was full of wit and vivacity. She had a good share of plain common sense, and but very little vanity. If she was vain of anything it was of her handsome husband, to whom she had been now four months married, and—of her beautiful teeth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. It was a bright and cheerful May morning, after a refreshing night shower. Caroline Archer, with two or three other apprentices were seated at work upon a superb green riding dress, which, apparently, was nearly finished. The morning seemed too lovely to remain within. Caroline glanced out of the back window into the little parterre, adorned with a few flower pots of geraniums and monthly roses, and sighed. The little canary bird in the cage hung up by the outside of the door, sung with most noisy hilarity as the slanting sun-beams, that poured into the yard between the tall, surrounding roofs, shone warm upon his perch, while a mocking bird, in the neighboring yard of a French peruquier poured forth a flood of ravishing songs, as if trying to rival the yellow minstrel by the richness and wonderful variety of his strains. Glimpses from the open door were caught of passengers in the streets—gliding past, all gay, cheerful, and seemingly happy. Caroline sighed again, and bending her face over her work, pursued her toil. She sighed not to mingle in the gay throng---nor for liberty —though confinement to one so young and naturally light hearted, and with a soul to enjoy the happiness of life was irksome and trying. She sighed to think of her mother's lonely and desolate condition, at such a joyous hour. `How she would enjoy this bright sunshine! If I could only be at home for half an hour to lead her forth on a short walk!' were her thoughts. She had also recently had a new cause for anxiety. Her mother's illness had not only exhausted all her own little wages, but had left her with no means to meet their quarterly rent of twenty dollars, which was due that evening at nine o'clock. She knew not how to obtain it---- knew not what to do. She was, therefore, sad and thoughtful, and full of anticipation of evil to those she loved. Unless the rent was promptly met, she knew that their cruel landlady (for a coarse, vulgar woman, who kept an inn at the corner of their street, was the owner of their tenement,) would, as she had threatened, seize upon their little furniture, and turn them into the street. While she was indulging these happy thoughts, a young gentleman entered the shop in front; for Mrs. Carvil, the milliner, like many others in her line, kept a dry goods store, in addition to her millinery department. `There's a customer. I cannot go into the shop, for this braid must be set on, and if Mrs. Wharton don't get her dress by eleven o'clock, I shall lose one of my best customers,' said Mrs. Carvil, a little lady, with a very little foot, a very little waist, a very little beauty, a very little sense, a very little pug nose, and a very great deal of temper.— `Caroline, he is a young fellow—you go and wait on him! And mind you, dare go behind the counter with that serious, sickly look! I can see you through the glass door, and if you dont wear your finest shop-smile for him, look out—that's all—look out! I am not agoing to have my customers driven away by cross looks in my girls—when a smile, that costs nothing, will make many a young fellow leave twenty dollars behind him. I have a certain smile, girls,' she continued, as Caroline rose to obey her, `that has brought me in more than one fifty dollar bill in my time;' and Mrs. Carvil screwed her withered visage into an extraordinary muscular contortion that many a man would willingly give fifty dollars to escape a second infliction of. Caroline was despatched by Mrs. Carvil to wait on the young gentleman because she was the loveliest of her flock, and experience had shown the milliner the wisdom of this species of policy. It was only when `fine gentlemen' were the customers, Caroline was sent into the shop; on all other occasions Mrs. Carvil herself, or one of the other girls officiated. Caroline entered the shop with a heavy heart, and as she was passing round the counter, seeing that the customer was a fashionable and remarkably handsome young man, she approached the place where he stood with a rising color end a step of timidity. `Have you gloves?' he asked, lifting his fine eyes to her face. There was a golden glow of surprise and an involuntary change to the deepest respect in the concluding tones of his voice, as his glance rested on her face, that bore testimony to her charms. She could not but be sensible of the cause of his emotion, and the mantling blush of maidenly embarrassment heightened her loveliness. With an agitated hand she took down the packages of gloves, without lifting her eyes to the admiring gaze which she knew was ardently, yet respectfully, stealing glances of her beauty, laid them before him. He at length selected several pairs of gloves, and, taking out an elegant green wallet with a mimature on the inside, paid for them in silence, and she delivered them to him in the same eloquent silence. Caroline was all the while strangely embarrassed, and so evidently was the young gentleman; and a timid glance she had ventured to steal of his face as he was measuring a pair of gloves upon his white and symmetrical hand, awakened in her bosom an interest in him such as she had never before experienced towards any of the numerous young gentlemen she had seen. She could not define it, but it will be plain to the female reader that it was the first tender germ of love. When he departed from the shop, which he did with a bow of the most respectful admiration, it was with a heightened cheek, a throbbing heart, and emotions of mingled pain and pleasure that Caroline returned to the sewing room. `How much did he buy?' asked Mrs. Carvil, as Caroline resumed her needle, and bent her head low over her work to conceal, beneath a cloud of curls, the confusion that she felt was telling tales upon her. The maiden's reply was low and inaudible, as her face was still concealed, while her needle seemed to have forgot its wonted skill, and made awkward work upon the edges of the elegant riding habit. `Miss Archer—if you please,' said Mrs. Carvil, in the emphatic tone and accent of offended dignity, bridling up her person, and looking angrily at her apprentice. `Six pairs, ma'am,' said Caroline more distinctly, without raising her head. `I am glad you have found your tongue, Miss. What are you doing, trollop? Look at them stitches. As I am a living woman, if the girl is not working a button-hole stitch on the hem. If you don't know what you're about, Caroline Archer, you had best put on your bonnet and shawl. A hint's enough to some folks.' Caroline's cheek now became as pale as it was hitherto roseate; and really alarmed at the angry language of her mistress, she instantly picked out the unfortunate button-hole stitch, and nimbly plying her needle for the next half hour, when the riding dress was completed, amply atoned for her fault.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. A little before one o'clock, on the same day in which the scenes at the miliner's took place, a gallant cavalcade, consisting of half a dozen ladies and gentlemen, started from the door of one of the princely mansions in Girard Place, and, full of gaiety and spirits, turned towards Broad street. Here they gave the rein to their spirited horses, aud at a rapid pace rode along this magnificent avenue, which, but for the railroad that disfigures it, would be without a parallel in the cities of the Union. A few minutes swift riding brought them into the suburbs, and after winding through many shady lanes, and traversing pleasant roads, adorned with citizens' villas, they issued upon a spacious thoroughfare, crowded with carriages, pedestrians, and horsemen, and, soon after, descending a hill, from which was a most delightful rural prospect of woodland, lawn, and river, they drew rein at the gate of the Laurel Hill Cemetery. By the courtesy of the very gentlemanly originator and director of this lovely spot, Mr. Smith, the ladies were permitted, without the trouble of dismounting, to ride through the gravelled avenue of this exquisite place. `Pray, Mr. Smith,' asked one of the ladies, distinguished less by a superb green riding-habit, that swept the ground with its flowing folds, than by the elegance of her figure, the dazzling beauty of her face, the perfection of her seat in the saddle, and the admirable maniege of her steed; `pray, Mr. Smith, do tell me if that is one of Thom's statues of Souter Jonny you have in that niche?' `Ride nearer, Mrs. Wharton, where you can look over the iron fence, and you will recognise in it a graver friend of yours than Souter Jonny,' said the director smiling. `It is Old Mortality, in very truth, Percy ---Frank, did you ever see any thing so perfect. I wish Walter Scott were of our party and could see it. How it would delight the good old gentleman.' `Which of them, Scott or Mortality, sis?' asked the young man whom she had called Frank, the very same young gentleman that had made Caroline Archer work a button-hole stitch on `a hem.' A pair of fawn colored gloves he had purchased were upon his hands. `Are you not ashamed, Frank, to destroy Emmy's sentiment?' asked Percy Warton, smiling. `Frank has no more sentiment than Sultan here!' she said, patting her horse upon the arches mane. `See how intelligently he looks, as if he were alive to the beauties of the sculpture and had read Waverly. Out upon you, brother Frank.' `Believe me sis, he is trying to spell out that tin sign hung on the statue, like a porter's label.' `Silence, brother! this is no place for light conversation. Indeed, I think it will be wrong to ride through the cemetery.' `Trains of funeral carriages traverse it daily,' Mrs. Wharton,' said the proprieter, `and I always drive in in my barouche.' `You had best ride in, Emily,' said Percy, `as we have planned a long ride before we return to the city, and there will be detention in re-mounting.' Slowly moving along the ascending and winding avenues, the whole party, accompanied by the attentive director, went through the whole cemetery, lingering here and there before a monument, and selecting lovely spots where they thought they would love to lie when life's cares were over. `Elizabeth!' repeated Mrs. Wharton, pausing before a simple block of white marble erected above a greon grave. `How touching! Not another word on the tomb! How affectingly touching! Here is another `My daughter, aged seventeen years!' What a tale these few eloquent words tell.' Thus they wandered through the rural grounds of the cemetery, yet pausing a moment on the highest part, where all its ways met, to contemplate a prospect that has no equal. The Schuylkill, stretched away to the right and left, presenting on either hand the most perfect scenery, so that it was difficult to decide which were the lovelier, the northern or southern view. Its banks were adorned by groves of oak and elm, that from sloping green hills, descended till they hung over the water, which was black with their shadows. Numerous villas, with laws of bright green spread before them, studded here and there with a copse or a group of venerable trees, were half hid, half seen through the torests on either shore; while the quiet and repose of the whole was relieved and enlivened by gaily painted canal barges, gliding beneath the banks and filling the air with the wild melody of their bugles. `How lovely!' was the exclamation of all, after they had surveyed the beauty of the prospect. `Do you remember Mount Auburn?' asked Percy of Emily. `Yes, but it is less lovely than this. Here, methinks, I would willingly repose after death. I never thought so of Mount Auburn. There is a gloom and awful solemnity about its deep glens and dark dells, fringed with pine and cypress, that made me shudder as I entered them. What lovelier place could one desire, dear Percy, than beneath yonder graceful willow---where the sun-beam is broken into diamonds ere it falls on the sward, and where the singing birds light and pour forth their happy song.' `A literary friend of mine who was here yesterday,' said Mr. Smith, `spoke of the same spot, and was so struck with its retired beauty, that he was half inclined to remove two lovely children buried at the South and place them here.' `It is, indeed, a lovely spot. If it were mine, I would have a monument erected there with simply `Percy' and `Emily' upon it,' said Mrs. Wharton, with tenderness. `Nay, dear Emma—this is idle!' said Percy, with a look of distress. `We will return to the gate, Frank, and mount our horses. Good morning, Mr. Smith, and receive our thanks for your kindness and courtesy. Laurel Hill is a lovely place—but all its loveliness will not disguise the fearful use to which it is devoted. Allons, Emma.' As he spoke, he unintentionally waved his riding whip with a quick movement near the head of her fiery horse, which started back and reared with her so high, that, fearing she would lose her seat and fall backward, she struck him a smart blow with her whip. The animal, enraged at this, bounded forward along the avenue on a run, and with the bit in his teeth, rapidly followed the windings of the walk, perilling her life at every turn in the path, and swiftly descended the excavated road leading to the gate. Mrs. Wharton did not lose her presence of mind, and maintained her seat like a good horsewoman; but all her strength and management was not sufficient to give her command of the curb. The gentlemen had followed, like the wind, to intercept the horse ere he reached the gate, and were turning the angle on the mound that brought them in sight of it, when they saw the horse, who found the gate closed against him, turn short round to retrace his steps, and throw her with the saddle, the girth of which broke, with violence against a column of the arch. In a moment Percy and her brother were at her side, and supporting her in their arms. She was bleeding profusely from the mouth, but to the earnest inquiries of both she replied she was not hurt, as the saddle had broken the force of her fall. `I have only cut my lip, I believe,' she said with a smile, trying to re-assure her alarmed husband. She put her hand to her mouth as she spoke, and with a shriek, such as only a beautiful woman with a fine set of teeth could give at such a moment, almost fainted in Percy's arms. `My dear Emma—you are dying!' he ex claimed in alarm. `Alas, my beautiful wife.' `Alas, my beautiful teeth!' `Teeth!' `I have lost my teeth,' she said with despair. `Nothing more. Thank heaven! I thought you were seriously hurt.' `My teeth, Percy! my beautiful teeth!' `Here is one—here is another—by the rood! here are four of them, sister Emma!' cried Frank, gathering up from the gravel, as he spoke, four of those brilliant teeth which had made Mrs. Wharton's smile so fascinating, and of which, next to Percy, she was so, innocently, vain. `Have you lost any more!' `Any more!' repeated Mrs. Wharton, in despair. `Indeed, Emily dearest, have you suffered no other injury than the loss of your teeth.' `No other Percy.' `I am thankful for the preservation of your life.' `You will love me no longer, Percy. I shall be a fright! I would rather have been—' `Killed outright, you were going to add, I dare say, sis,' said Frank, kissing her tenderly; `for a pretty woman to lose her life is, I believe, a less sacrifice than to lose her beauty. But never despair. You have got beauty enough left to make a hundred foolish fellows, like Percy here, fall in love with you.' `What shall I do! Mercy! my voice sounds like grandma's!' `You have the advantage, then,' said Frank, `of knowing how you will speak when you get to be a grandma?' `Frank, you have no pity! What shall I do, Percy?' `Go to Dr. —'s, the dentist.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. The same afternoon, Dr. — was in his handsomely furnished reception room, leaning back in his arm chair, with a Regalia cigar in his lips, which he was idly indulging, for he had just dined. With the last Lady's Book in his fingers, he was, at the same time, listlessly looking at the print of fashions, and wondering (for he was a bachelor) how many enamelled teeth he must set in a year to keep a wife in fashionable dresses, if he should run the risk of taking one, when a carriage suddenly drew up at his door, steps were let down, and the next instant his bell was rung with an emphasis that made him start. He looked through his blinds. `Ladies! and at this hour! The room is filled with tobacco smoke. 'Tis Percy Wharton and his beautiful wife, (I would give an eagle a piece for her teeth) aad her brother, Mr. Francis Astley, who I know makes a practice of smoking in her drawing-room. She is therefore used to it. I will make no apologies.' The party entered the dentist's room, and were received by him with professional courtesy. Mrs. Wharton was pale, and a cambric ksrchief covered her beautiful—alas! no longer beautiful—mouth! `You smoke cigars, Doctor,' said young Astley. `I will trouble you.' `With the greatest pleasure in the world, sir,' answered the Doctor, giving him his cigar case; `but I should apologize to Mrs. Wharton for smoking in my receiving-room; but not expecting ladies at this late hour—' `I have come Dr. — to ask you if you can restore my teeth,' said Mrs. Wharton, interrupting him, and removing her kerchief from her mouth. `Your teeth, madam!' `I have lost four by a fall from my horse.' `Those beautiful teeth! permit me to look, madam.' The Doctor held up both hands in unfeign ed astonishment and commiseration, for, like a professional architect gazing with pain upon a scene of architectural ruins, the restoration of which would be his gain, he contemplated the devastation of the even rows of snowy teeth he had before admired, with sorrow, notwithstanding his imagination filled up the gap with guineas `Indeed, madam, it is the world's pity! he said, shaking his head. `Can you do nothing for me?' she asked, watching his countenance with sinking heart. `Nature, madam, is the best dentist. I can never match the pearly transparency of the remaining teeth. Two upper and two lower, and directly in front! Oh, what a misfortune. Two incisors—two cuspids What a sad misfortune!' `You must remedy it, Doctor.' `Never saw so fine a set of teeth in my life! Would have given a sovereign a piece for them!' soliloquized the dentist. `Have you the teeth, madam?' `Here they are Doctor,' said Astley, taking them from his silk purse. `Beautiful! Incomparable!' exclaimed the dentist, looking at them with the eye of a connoissieur. `Can you replace them, Doctor?' she asked, faintly. `Worth a guinea each. What translucent enamel! a manufacture of such would make my fortune!' `Doctor!' exclaimed Mrs. Wharton, with petulant impatience, seeing he paid no attention to her. `I beg pardon madam.' `Can you replace my teeth?' `No, madam.' `Can you match them?' `I will give you five guineas a-piece to do it,' said Percy Wharton. `There is but one way,' said the dentist, with hesitation. `Name it—it shall be done at my sacrifice.' `By extracting teeth from another's jaw and placing them with the nerve still warm in the cavities of your own.' `Oh, horrid!' exclaimed Emily Wharton, with a shudder. `Will any human being submit to such a sacrifice?' asked Francis Astley, with surprise. `If paid for it. I have thrice performed this operation since I have been in practice.' `Who were the victims?' asked Astley, with surprise. `Those who have the most beautiful teeth in the world?' answered the dentist, with a smile. `You don't mean'— `I do mean your negresses.' `Hear this Emma?' said Frank, with a mischievous smile. `The idea is absolutely disgusting!' answered Percy, with a corresponding contortion of the lips. `I had rather go without teeth,' said Mrs. Wharton. `You will have to put up with the ordering false teeth, Emma,' observed her husband. `Can you match my own?' `With difficulty, they are so brilliant.' `Try, Doctor,' said Percy, `and if you succeed you shall be well paid.' `If Mrs Wharton will do me the honor to call to-morrow, at twelve, I will then have a set that I think will suit her so far as false teeth will compensate for natural ones—especially such as she has lost.' `Doctor, don't speak of them, I beg of you. I will call to-morrow,' said Mrs. Wharton, preparing to go. `You will not think, then, of the other proposition I suggested'— `No, sir,' replied Percy Wharton, with indignation. The door closed—the carriage rolled away —and the dentist was left alone. `How prejudiced are some people!' he ejaculated, as the sounds of the wheels died away. `There is many a mulattress with the finest teeth imaginable—scarcely as beautiful as these, indeed—that would lose them for a guinea each. 'Tis rather shocking to a young husband's taste, to have his wife's mouth filled wiih an African girl's teeth, to be sure! But there is no help for it if he would have her mouth restored!' Thus soliloquized Dr. —; and falling asleep in his arm chair, with the four teeth he had been admiring held in the open palm of his hand, he dreamed that a sudden cloud came up, and that amid thunder and lightning a storm of hail descended, breaking in every pane of his glass, and covering his floors with glittering hail-stones, which, as they fell, he saw to his surprise, instead of being ice, were the most beautiful teeth— incisors, cuspids, bicuspids, and molars— which for whiteness, symmetry, transparency and polish, far surpassed any thing of the kind he had ever seen, `Now will I supply Mrs. Wharton's loss and rival nature!' he exclaimed, as a clap of thunder shook his apartments and awakened him to the consciousness that a smart shower was pattering against his windows. `My teeth are all rain-water! Poor Mrs. Wharton will have to wait for these big drops of rain to crystalize. There is my bell. I thought I heard it when I was asleep. Where is that confounded boy Pete, that is ever out of the way when he is wanted!' Thus speaking, the Doctor rose from his arm-chair and opened his door to a servant in livery, with a dripping umbrella in his hand, who leaving a note with him, hastily departed. It read thus: `If Doctor — knows of a young healthy white person, with a fine set of teeth that will match hers, and who for a sufficient remuneration is willing to sacrifice them and substitute a set of false ones for them, Mrs. Wharton will consent to the arrangement, though greatly against her proper feeling. Mrs. W. will pay the person not only five guineas each, but provide, at her own expense, a set of your best false teeth for her. Your own remuneration for effecting this will be whatever you fix it at. Mrs. W. will call at 12, as requested. `No. — Girard Place. 5 o'clock. P.M. `This Mrs. Wharton is a sensible woman. If her note is not written without her husband's knowledge. I have no skill in detecting mystery in female handwriting. A young healthy person, with a fine set of teeth.— Hum! It were a difficult matter to find a counterpart to these four teeth in the incisors or cuspids of any `young healthy person' of my acquaintance. I know every good set of teeth in the city. Not one like hers, though, and of that peculiar transparent enamel! It's a bad job. I will advertise!' Thus determining, the dentist sat down to his escrutoire and wrote this advertisement for the morning paper: `A young woman, from sixteen to eighteen years of age, who has a fine set of teeth, and who is willing for a valuable consideration to part with four of the front ones, will please call at the office of Dr. —, dentist, No. — — Row, to-day, between 12 and 1 o'clock.' `I think that will do. 'Tis an odd advertisement, but it's nobody's business! It shall go in. There's doubtless many a one of the pretty shop girls I have seen smiling and displaying teeth that would make a dentist's fortune, would be glad, for a hundred silver dollars, to lose every tooth they have in their heads. Here Pete, you scoundrel, you! You come in now that the rain drives you in doors! Take this advertisement to the Daily Chronicle office, and tell the editor it most be inserted in to-morrow's morning's paper. Do you hear, Pete?' `Yeth, thir,' lisped the little negro in reply. `Then scamper, and if you are not back in twenty minutes I'll draw every tooth out of your head.' `Yeth, thir,' answered the urchin, disappearing through the door; while the easy tempered dentist, looking after him with a smile, gave himself up to conjectures upon the probable issue of his advertisement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. The same evening, a few minutes before nine o'clock, in a small apartment in one of the humblest dwellings of the city alleys, was assembled the small family that occupied it. It consisted of a pale middle-aged woman with the traces of beauty and refinement upon her sickly features, lying upon a neat but plain bed that stood on one side of the room, —and a lovely girl in youthful bloom, save that the lily of confinement and care had supplanted the joyous rose that should have tinted her cheek, who sat by the bed-side and read to her from the Bible, while the sewing, she had temporarily put down, lay upon her lap. In a trundle bed that was partly rolled beneath the larger, slept two handsome little boys that were the very images of their sister; while seated by the candle which gave light to her, was their elder brother, a little lame lad, but very intellectual looking, as almost all lame boys are. He had Captain Riley's travels in his hand, and was reading his adventures with absorbing interest, Caroline continued to read aloud: `Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy. `To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. `Our soul waiteth for the Lord, he is our health and our shield. `Our hearts shall rejoice in him: because we have trusted in his holy name.' `How beautiful this language, dear mother.' `It is precious, indeed, my child. Every word touches my heart, and in every sentence I see the faithful promise of the widow's God.' At this moment an abrupt knock was heard at the door, and the city clocks began to toll nine. `It is the landlady,' exclaimed Caroline, as her heart flew into her mouth. `Fear not, my daughter, she is in God's hands as well as we.' Caroline opened the door, and a large, masculine-looking woman, with a red fleshy face, and a hard expression to her little gray eyes, appeared at it. `Well, Miss, I have come for my rent. I have given your mother since yesterday twelve o'clock, to raise it. I suppose it's ready for me.' And with these words she entered the room and seated herself in a chair by the door with the insolent and over-bearing air of a mistress in her own house. `Indeed, Mrs. Cringle, I have not yet heard from my brother in Louisville, to whom I wrote, and he is my only dependence,' said Mrs. Archer from the bed. `I shall soon hear—have the kindness to indulge me a few days.' `You'll get no letters, I tell ye, now, Mrs. Archer; if you do there'll be no more money in't than'll hide my thumb-nail. These brothers are as fond of keeping their money as other folk. No—I can't wait. My rent I must have, and my rent I will have. So pay it over, or tramp!' `Indeed, Mrs. Cringle'— `Don't Mrs. Cringle me with your indeeds. If you han't no money, what are you doin' with that gilt portrait up there? The pawn-broker 'll advance you a five on't.' `It's my husband's.' `So much the better to belong to a dead person. I sold all my man's dud's—watch, black profile, and all. When one husband's gone make a clean sweep for a new one— that's my maxim. Here's young Miss here with a new bright gown on!' `It's only clean and smoothly ironed, Mrs. Cringle. It is a cheap calico, and I have worn it several months,' said Caroline with gentleness. `Why don't you help your mother? you work at the milliners's and must earn something.' `I do earn a little, ma'am—from two to three 'levies a day, but there are five mouths to feed—five to clothe—besides medicine for mother.' `Yes, and not a dollar for your rent. This won't do for me—I must have tenants that'll pay. So down with twenty-five dollars or march. Not a thing do you carry off with you. Every article here would'nt two-thirds pay me. So down with it.' `I implore you to be merciful,' cried Mrs. Archer, raising herself in the bed—do not visit your vengeance upon my children.' `What right have you to take a house when you were not able to pay the rent. It's downright swindlin' o' honest folks.' `We must have a shelter somewhere—and we hoped to be able to pay for it—but I have been sick, and misfortunes have come upon us in various ways.' `This is the old song. It won't come over me. I must have my rent.' `We cannot pay it to-night, Mrs. Cringle,' said Caroline, imploringly—`if you have any human feeling let my mother remain in your house until to-morrow afternoon, and in the meanwhile I will see what I can to do to raise the amount due you. Surely charity and generosity have not fled the human breast. There must be some way of relief.' `There is a way you can get the money very easily, my pretty Miss,' said the vile hag, with a look and glance, that the purity of Caroline's nature could not understand. `Oh, how—tell me how?' she asked eagerly. `Do you ask me how, with that pretty face of yours, and nice young figure! I could show you many a fine young gentleman who would make your fortune for ye, and in one hour from now place ten times my debt in your hands.' `Fiend! I understand you now! Oh, God! that I should come to this!' For a moment Caroline struggled to suppress her tears, but in vain. Her pure, insulted spirit was crushed, and she burst into a shower of bitter tears. She wept as if her heart would break. Even the devilish landlady was at length moved. `Well, child—I've seen greater matters than that I hinted at make a less to do! If you won't, why then you won't. I've known many a young girl sitivated like you would be glad of the offer I made you. Well, if you can pay me a part to-night, five dollars or so—I'll wait 'till to-morrow sun-down for the balance—an' if you can't pay then, vy you must tramp, and no more said!' `I have four dollars and three quarters—if that will satisfy you, take it,' said Caroline, going to her reticule. `It is the last I have saved from my wages for my sick mother. Take it up,' she said, laying it upon the table, and shrinking back from her instinctively—for her delicacy had received too severe a shock for her to bear the sight or touch of the iniquitous creature who had been the cause of it. `Well, this 'll do for to-night. I'll call to-morrow sun-down, and hopes you 'll have the balance. If as how you do, vy I'll be willin' to try ye here another quarter, if ye choose to stay.' Thus speaking, this iniquitous wretch, who is the counterpart of too many landladies and landlords of a certain class, left the house. She had scarcely closed the door, when with an agonizing shriek of poignant suffering, Caroline threw herself upon her mother's bed, and wept till gentle sleep sealed her sunses in oblivion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. The next morning Caroline put on her hat and shawl and went mechanically to her daily tasks at Mrs. Carvil's. On the way she was sadly thinking what she should do to relieve her mother, and was busily devising some way to obtain the money for her. The idea occurred to her of throwing herself upon the generosity of the lady of some wealthy citizen; but even her little knowledge of human nature had taught her that some ladies are apt to look with suspicion upon unfortunate girls, and are apt to have less charity for them than they should have; while she shrunk from applying to a gentleman, lest her motives might be misinterpreted, and her delicacy hurt by dreaded offers of conditional assistance, that might wound her maidenly sensibility far more than the landlady's words had done. What to do she knew not, and with a thousand schemes in her mind she had come to no determination when she found herself in Walnut street, and within a few doors of Mrs. Carvil's. `Oh, what, what shall I do! If I go in she will not let me go for the rest of the day, and something must be effected before I return home. Oh, that I could find a purse with twenty-one dollars in it—for there seems no other way of relief.' She had scarcely spoken when she beheld lying upon the side-walk, a few steps before her, a small green pocket-book. She bounded forward and caught it up with a cry between hope and doubt. A glance showed her it was full of bank notes. The next moment she was in Mrs. Carvill's little par lour, and as she was the earliest there of the apprentices, she was alone. With a trembling hand she took the pocket-book from her bosom and furtively unclasped it. Within was a miniature, and she recognized it as the same the purchaser of the gloves had taken out to pay her for them. She trembled still more, and partly unfolding the notes, she saw the figures 50, XX, X, 5, upon them.— She offered up a short ejaculation of gratitude, while visions of the happiness she could bring to her mother that evening filled her heart with joy. But what means this sudden paleness of the cheek—this sinking of the spirits—this dropping of the whole form but now so animate with hope and joy? What means this desponding air and aspect of despair mingled with resignation! Why has she slowly reclasped the book, and why dejectedly return it to her bosom! The reflection has suddenly flashed upon her mind that the treasure is not hers—that it belongs to another—that he has no right to make use of it without the owner's permission— that it is a sacred thing. `No—no—' she said, with virtuous resolution that gave brightness to her eye and a heightened flush to her cheek, `it is not mine! I will let the storm burst upon our devoted roof ere I seek to avert it by guilt. No —I will discover and restore it to the owner —and in the meanwhile forget that I have found it!' Having made this noble resolution, she opened the pocket book and counted the amount it contained, which was three hundred and seventy-five dollars in the United States Bank notes, and restored them to their place in it. On the edge of the pocket book she then saw written, Francis Astley, No. — Girard Place. `No, it is not mine! Heaven has kept me from using it. If I'd taken a portion of it, and afterwards been unable to make it up, my fair name and honor would have been in his power. Protector of the innocent I thank thee for delivering me from this great temptation.' With the determination of sending her eldest brother with to Girard Place, when she should return me at noon, she sat herself down to work with a heart relieved (she knew not why) from a great load, and with that consciousness of rectitude which ever carries with it its own reward. She felt, too, less anxiety than she had hitherto done about the result of the day's events, and seemed buoyed up with the assurance that all would yet be well with herself and all dear to her. About ten o'clock in the forenoon the newsbop threw into the door the morning paper, which one of the young girls caught up and began to read aloud to Mrs. Carvil, while she was basting a dress for the apprentice to begin upon. After the items of morning news had been ended and characteristically commented upon by Mrs. Carvil, who took especial interest in the police reports, she said, `Now look, Jane, for the new advertisements. I wonder if Madame Gaubert comes out with any thing new. These French women are taking the bread out of us honest folks mouths.' `Here's an advertisement, Mrs. Carvil,' cried Jane, who had, meanwhile, been running her eye over the morning advertising column, `here's an advertisement that is a curious one! I wonder if it is serious!' `Read it girl,' said Mrs. Carvil, sharply, `and we then can hest tell! Here the apprentice read aloud Dr. —'s advertisement. `It's all a hoax!' said a pretty black-eyed chery lip'd girl, at work on the same seam with Caroline. `How do you know, pert, that it's a hoax!' tartly questioned her mistress. `I once had a dentist—a proper handsome man he was too—offer me a five dollar bill a piece for two of my front teeth—he said they were so white and shapely, he wanted 'em as models. See girls they are sound and white yet!' Here Mrs Carvil grinned a ghastly smile around upon her apprentices, for the purpose of displaying the two ill-shapen rows of yellow teeth, with an intermixture of glaring ghastly white one, for which, plainly, she was indebted to the skill of some proper handsome dentist. `Do you think it earnest then, marm?' asked the reader of the paper. `To be sure I do!' `Then why don't you go, Mrs. Carvil,' said the black eyed apprentice, gravely—`I dare say the dentist would be glad to get such beautiful teeth as yours!' `Mrs. Carvil eyed her sharply, to see if she was quizzing her, for, truth he told, she had little faith in her own assertions of the beauty of her old teeth; but seeing her seriously continue her sewing, she said, complacently, `I would, but can't bear the pain of the destraction of so many teeth.' `Caroline, suppose you go,' said the black eyed maiden, with a laugh; `you certainly have the prettiest teeth I ever saw! If my teeth were even,' she said, smiling and displaying as she did so exceedingly white but somewhat irregular teeth, `I would lose four of them for—for'— `For how much, now? asked Mrs Carvil. `For fifty dollars,' she answered, after a moments thought. `I think I would for half that,' said Jaue. `What would you lose four of your teeth for, Caroline?' asked she with the cherry lips. Caroline did not reply. She had taken with an unsteady grasp the paper from the hand of her fellow-apprentice, and with an effort of calmness, through which those who knew her history could clearly see the anxious, eager earnestness beneath it, read the advertisement. All at once her face assumed its natural expression, and, laying down the paper, after taking a single look more at the advertisement as if to fix the address upon her mind, she replied, with a bright smile to the question of her fellow. `I would take for my teeth only what would purchase my mother's, my three brothers, and my own happiness, give us all a roof to sleep beneath for this night, and feel no anxiety for the morrow.' `You value your teeth very highly, Miss Archer,' observed Mrs. Carvil, with a toss of her head—`It would take five hundred dollars to do all that.' `Five thousand dollars for the mere money's sake, madam, would not induce me to part with my teeth. The happiness and comforts of which I have spoken I value far above wealth. The peace and comfort of a family are not measured by any scale of gold and silver. If one dollar would save my mother from sorrow, and I could get it only by sacrificing my teeth, I would as cheerfully part with them as I would for one hundred thousand—for the end would be the same whether attained for one dollar or a million.' `I think you are getting on dictionary stilts, Miss Archer,' said Mrs. Carvil, who could not with her narrow mind quite comprehend the drift of her apprentice's argument. `I 'spose you mean to say, if your mother wanted money, you'd sell your teeth to get it for her.' `Yes, indeed, I would,' answered Caroline, firmly. `Then you might go and get work where you could; I'd have no toothless girls about me to frighten people away.' Caroline sighed, returned the sympathizing pressure of the dark-eyed apprentice's hand, under the table, and bending ever her work plied her needle in silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. The State House clock tolled twelve, and Dr. — rose from his dentist's bench where he had been at work several hours. `They are perfect. I have made so beautiful a piece of work of it that the owner herself might not disdain to have them replaced, if no one answers my advertisement.' As he spoke he held up to his own admiration the teeth Mrs. Warton had lost, accurately fitted to gold plates, and ready for replacing if necessary, or to supply the place of those that should be sacrificed by some hapless victim. `They are chef d'œuvres! Perfect! and they must fit any mouth that has teeth to fit Mrs. Wharton's. Incomparable!' Thus eulogizing them, the enthusiastic dentist carefully placed them upon his instrument case. `I wonder if anybody will answer my advertisement. 'Tis after twelve, and any one anxious to do it would have been here with the last stroke of the clock. But I hope no decent person in this benevolent city is so sunk in want as to fly to this alternative for relief. I have fitted the natural teeth so well to the elastic plate that Mrs. Wharton will scarcely object to them. She should be here soon. Ha! There is my bell. Pete, you vagabond, where are you? In the street playing marbles with the penny paper boys, I'll wager my eye teeth! I heard no carriage stop!' The dentist opened his door and saw before it a graceful young woman, who from the plain but neat straw cottage, green veil, and small cheap shawl, as well as from a certain air of gentility about her, he knew to be a milliner's apprentice. Her veil was closely drawn over her face, and her figure was hid beneath the folds of the shawl, but he could not fail to discover through all that her face was youthful and lovely, and that her figure was light and symmetrical. Her foot and hand—for the Doctor had an eye for female beauty, and his eyes sought unconsciously those never-erring signs of birth and well-breeding, were small—the foot exquisitely so. `Walk in, Miss,' said the dentist, with native gallantry, for Dr. — was a great admirer of beauty. `Thank you, sir! but—but'— `Pray be seated, Miss—tooth-ache, I suppose. I will extract it in a minute!' said the dentist, taking his `key' and scientifically winding his red silk handkerchief about its polished shaft. `No, sir—but'— and the soft musical voice trembled. `No tooth-ache!' repeated the Doctor, impressed by the richness of her low tones; `that I will asseverate; you have not the tooth-ache! Your voice would not be so even and musical if you had. An aching tooth in that fine toned instrument, the human voice, is like a key out of tune on a piano— it makes discord of the whole.' `You advertised, sir, I believe,' said Caroline, with a firmer tone. `Ah! I perceive. Is it possible you have come hither from reading my advertisement?' `Yes, sir.' `Are you willing to lose four of your teeth?' `Yes, sir—if—if'— `Paid well for them, you would say.' `No, sir,' cried Caroline, earnestly; `I care not for that so much as'—here she hesitated, and then added, abruptly—`I am in great need of a certain sum of money, sir, and will do it for that.' `Name the sum!' `Twenty dollars.' `Let me see your teeth, if you please,' said the Doctor, with feelings painfully touched by the emotion she in vain tried to suppress. She removed her veil and showed a face so very lovely, that he started back with an exclamation of surprise. He then asked in the most delicate and respectful manner to examine her mouth. Parting with an ivory slip the lips of the half-fainting yet resolute girl, as she sat in his `patients' chair,' he beheld the whitest and most symmetrically arranged teeth, each one perfeet in itself, he had ever met with—not even excepting Mrs. Wharton's `Are you in earnest in wishing to part with these fine teeth?' he demanded with astonishment, after admiring them for a few moments with delighted surprise. `Yes, sir,' `I beg of you do not part with them—it were sacrilege to mar so fair an instument— to destroy the ivory columns of so beautiful a temple! Are you sincere?' `Indeed, sir, I am.' `I fear me either great virtue or great avarice hath driven you to this, child!' `I beg of you, sir, tell me if my teeth are such as you require! `They are perfect,' he said, taking those which he had set upon the gold plate, and comparing them. `And will you give me twenty dollars for the four front ones, sir?' she asked with trembling doubt. `I will. Will you consent to have them drawn?' `At once.' The sound of a carriage driving to the door was now heard, and the Doctor desiring Caroline to retire to his ante-room from observation, the next moment received Mrs. Wharton. She was pale but no less lovely. 'You received my note, Doctor?' she asked seated. But I have, as you here see, fitted your teeth on plates so accurately that they can be replaced without difficulty, and will look nearly as well as before. Besides, you need not wait for the gums to heal, as I have a compositton for filling the cavities so that I can place them on at once. Look at them are they not beautiful?' `My poor teeth!' she said, sighing as she glanced at them. `Could you find no person, Doctor?' `I should prefer replacing these, madam.' `No. The idea of false teeth, gold plates in my mouth—I could not endure the thought. I should feel as if I were made of wires and plated! Is there no alternative!' `There is a young weman who is willing to lose her teeth,' said the Doctor dropping his voice; `but really they are so perfect—nature has made such a pretty piece of work of it—that I should regret to mar it.' `Are they so beautiful.' `As beautiful as your own were.' `Were! it is indeed were. Doctor I must have these teeth of hers. But is she young.' `Young and lovely. She is now in the next room. `Let me see her—no, I should rather not, on second thought—I should feel so awkward in meeting her afterwards. Does she know who wants her to make the sacrifice?' `No.' `Do not let her. Yet, I would like to see her. She may be a—but you would not deceive me.' `She is as fair as the snow. Come hither. Do you see the well-turned point of that shoe and instep, just visible within the room?' `I do. She is a young lady!' `Such a foot can belong to none other.' The Dentist having placed his patient and her victim in arm-chairs in their respective rooms, now prepared to go through his painful duty. Having carefully measured the depth of each of the cavities in Mrs. Wharton's mouth, he irritated the inner surface and made a slight incision on the sides so as to draw blood. Then, going into the room where Caroline was patiently and resolutely seated, he drew one of her teeth with such skill and ease as scarcely to give her pain, and returned with it into the room he had left. He measured it by the previously ascertained measures of the depth of the corresponding bed, when finding it a little too long, he clipped off the end and quickly and most skilfully placed it in the cavity he had prepared for it. In this manner he extracted four teeth from Caroline's head, and inserted them in Mrs. Wharton's, who under the operation suffered far more pain than she who had made the greater sacrifice. The whole operation occupied about twenty minutes. The teeth were beautifully reset, and when Mrs. Wharton looked in a small mirror he placed before her, she uttered, notwithstanding the inflamation and pain she still suffered, an involuntary scream of delight. `Doctor, bless you! The poor girl! She did not even cry out! Take this and reward her, and also give her from me, this diamond ring,' she added, removing a brilliant from her finger, and placing it, with a roll of bank notes in his hand. `You will take no food, Mrs. Wharton, that will require you to use your teeth, for three days, and will speak as little as you can in the mean time. It will be necessary with a preparation I shall give you, to bathe the gums repeatedly and keep your mouth as much closed for a day or two as possible. Be careful also of the cool air. I will call and see you to-morrow.' Having received the wash he had prepared, Mrs. Wharton took leave of the dentist with smiles, and he was left alone with the noble victim of female vanity. Mrs. Wharton was a sensible and pleasing woman! a kind and generous hearted woman! But what will not a beautiful woman consent to, be it never so cruel, to preserve or restore a charm! Let those ladies who would condemn Mrs. Wharton, withhold their judgment till they have been placed precisely in her situation. We neither condemn nor defend her—for gentlemen are not fair judges in a case which can never fall precisely within their persenal experience. As to the conduct of Caroline Archer my readers can have but one opinion. This noble girl felt no pain—no grief at the marring of her beauty—as one by one she gave her beautiful teeth to the fangs of the despoiling iron. She only thought of the relief she was to afford her beloved mother— that for three months longer she was securing to her a roof and a home. `You are a noble girl! I am sorry I have done this,' said the Doctor, as he returned to her. `Distress I fear has driven you to it. I would rather have forfeited the Lady's custom and the favour of her whole caste than have done this wicked thing! Why did you not ask me for money? I would rather have given one hundred dollars than had this done. But it is too late now to lament. But then you are such a noble girl! Some lofty and honest purpose had strengthened your spirit or you could never have borne pain as you have done. I must now repair, to the best of my power, the devastation I have made.' `The blood soon ceased flowing and in a few minutes the inflammation became so far reduced that he took up the pairs of teeth he had fitted to the plate and asked her if he should put them in their place. `Will you give me a mirror, sir?' `Not now, child. I will first fix these teeth in.' `Now, if you please sir.' He gave her the glass. She glanced into it, witnessed her disfigurement, and, like a true hearted woman as she was, burst into tears. They were soon dried up; and when a few minutes afterwards the dentist again handed her the mirror, she sprung to her feet with delight, no less great than Mrs. Wharton had shown. `They are like my own.' `They are indeed,' said the dentist, viewing this effect of his skill with gratification; `I hope they will supply their place. They will feel uncomfortably a day or two, but you will soon become accustomed to them. Now, miss, you desired twenty dollars. Here are one hundred dollars, the sum which the lady gave me for you as she promised to do. Here also is a ring worth as much more, which she took from her finger, and desired me to give you in token of her gratitude.' `Caroline took the ring and the money, scarcely believing the reality of what she heard. Then clasping together her hands, she sent up a silent offering of thanksgiving to him who had given her the virtue and courage to make the sacrifice of that natural female vanity common to all the young and lovely of her sex. `She is young, she is beautiful, and she is pious, soliloquized Dr. —, as he listened to her light footstep on the last stair as she retired. `I wish she had told me her history. She is a noble girl. I must find her out! What a lovely bride she would make. I must know who she is. She is in humble life, and she is very poor; doubtless in pressing misery, or she would hardly have made the sacrifice she has to-day. Pete;' `Thir!' cried a woolly-pated African lad, about fourteen years old, popping his head inio the door and grinning from ear to ear, with a half-smothered laugh he had brought in from the street. `You are here, are you, you scape-grace? Did you see that young woman go out?' `Yeth, thir.' `Follow, and see where she goes in, and bring me the name and number of the house. If you play by the way, I'll thrash you.' `Yeth thir.' `I will find her, and if she be respectable, be she poor as a parish priest's cow, I'll marry her if she'll have me.' Thus meditated Dr. —; and lighting his cigar, he gave himself up to a train of delightful hymeneal visions, which, like `the baseless fabric' of most bachelors' dreams, were destined, alas! to leave `no wreck behind.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. Mrs. Wharton drove home, and with pleasure exhibited her restored teeth to her delighted husband and brother Frank; but without telling them they had been an hour before in the head of a young girl. Percy she knew would be displeased, while she feared Frank's satire. So she kept her own secret, and left upon their minds the hest impression of Dr. —'s skill. Frank soon after took his hat, stick, and gloves, to go to the Gazette office to see if he could hear any thing of his pocket-book which he had dropped in returning from the six o'clock New York boat, to which he had been to see a party of friends off. `You will scarcely recover it, Frank,' said Percy as he was going out, `you deserve to lose it for carrying so large a sum about you daily. No gentleman, when he is at home, should make a practice of keeping more than twenty dollars in his pocket-book at a time.' `I care more about the miniature on it for which alone I bought it in Paris, fancying it resembled a school girl I used to know. But what makes it more valuable is that I have within a day or two seen a charming creature in a milliner's store in Walnut street, that is the perfect resemblance of it. I wouldn't have lost it for the value of the notes in it.' `Have a care, Frank. These Philadelphia grizettes are the most dangerous in the world.' `She is perfectly lovely, Percy. A small white hand, like a high bred girl, and an eye and lip so eloquent with expression and purity of soul, that—' `You fell in love with her.' `I have, I positively believe. Her wonderful likeness to my miniature first struck me.' `Your earnest manner, brother Frank, is ominous of danger to both herself and you. Do not pursue the acquaintance—it can only end in her ruin and your own dishonor.' `By heaven, Percy! you wrong my motives, I tell you she is divinely beautiful, and so pure that an impure thought cannot live in her presence.' `You are in love, Frank, and very romantic withal. I hope nothing worse than romance will come of it. Emma will have to pick out some fair girl as a wife for you. It's time you were married, Frank.' `I mean to be one of these days—I wonder who this lovely milliner can be!' `Daughter of some honest tradesman, like enough, perhaps, your boot-maker's niece!' answered Percy, with playful but severe irony. Frank colored, bit his lip, and hastily descended from the drawing-room to the hall. As he reached the door, the street bell was rung, and on opening it, he saw a handsome little lame boy, with a pale face, but dark eyes, full of intellect and intelligence. He was at once interested in his appearance. `Who do you wish to see, my little lad?' he inquired, in a gentle tone. `Mr. Francis Astley.' `I am he.' `Did you lose a pocket-book, sir?' `I did.' `A green one?' `A green one with a miniature in it.' `Here it is sir. My sister found it in Walnut street this morning.' With these words, the boy took from his pocket a snowy cambric handkerchief, and unfolding it, delivered to him his pocket book. The name of `Caroline Archer' prettily written on one corner of the handkerchief caught his eye before it was returned to his pocket. `Will you see if the contents are safe, sir?' `Its of no consequence, my good boy. I hardly remember what sum was in it,' said Frank, opening it and just glanced at the notes. `There were three hundred and seventy-five dollars in it when it was found sir.' `I now remember that was the amount.— Come into the hall, and I will count it to gratify you.' He found it correct, and taking the seventy-five dollars, presented it to the boy. `No, I thank you, sir.' `It is yours. Take it my lad. `I have only returned your pocket book, sir. I have merited no reward.` `If you will not take it, you have no right to refuse it for your sister. Take this one hundred dollar bill, and tell her the owner of the pocket book presents it to her for her integrity. It will purchase her wedding ornaments one of these days. She must be a nice girl. How much younger than you is she?' `She is older, sir. I am fifteen and she is seventeen,' he replied, receiving the note. `Ah! What is your name?' `Henry Archer.' `Where do you live?' `In — alley.' `Hum! Well, I must do something for you, my fine lad. Come and see me this time on Monday. Why do you linger? Would you ask me any question?' `I would rather have my sister's miniature, sir, than money.' `Your sister's miniature, sir!' `Yes, sir—in the pocket book. I will gladly return you the hundred dollars for it, if you please sir.' `Is this is a likeness of your sister who found it?' `Yes, sir. And ma wonders how you came to have it. She hopes, and so do I, sir, that there's nothing wrong about it.' `Gothing wrong my lad. Is your sister a milliner's apprentice?' `Yes, sir, in Walnut street.' `The very same!' exclaimed Frank, half-audibly. `Sir.' `Nothing, my lad. I will let you have the picture one of these days, perhaps. Her name is Caroline Archer, is it?' `Yes, sir.' `That will do. Don't forget to come to me on Monday. With these words, Francis Astley accompanied the lad to the door, and let him out. `Well, this is extraordinary. Fortune is entangling the thread of my life with this pretty milliner, it is plain. Well, there is no resisting fate.' And with this conclusive reasoning, he sallied forth to lounge down Ghestnut street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. One forenoon, a few weeks after the events just related, a young girl was seated in the elegant working-room of Mrs. Wharton, at No. — Girard Place. Mrs. Wharton had some gala dress to be cut and fitted, and being a little indisposed, sent to Mrs. Carvil for her `best hand.' Caroline Archer was sent. When she reached the door and recognized the number, she remembered that it was the same that was in the pocket-book. She hesitated to enter, lest she should encounter young Astley, whom she had not seen since the day before she had found it.— But she was not mistress of her own will, and ringing the bell was admitted. In the interval between the time of the foregoing chapter and the present, Caroline's domestic happiness had much increased, by means of the costly price she had paid to secure it.— Her mother's health was improving, and she had numerous little comforts of which she was before destitute. A private school teacher of great celebrity had also written her a note saying that arrangements for three years tuition of her eldest son had been made with him by a young gentleman, and that his seat and place in his classes were waiting for him. This was gladly and gratefully accepted by the mother. Caroline still continued, however, at Mrs. Carvil's, but returning prosperity and hope had restored to her cheek its bloom, and to her eye its brilliancy, and to her lip its smile. So well had Dr. — done his part, that no one, save himself and her mother, was possessed of her secret. She had cut and fitted the waist of the ball dress upon which she had been at work, and it being of a new and showy fashion, Mrs. Wharton wished to have Percy's opinion— aware that in female dress gentlemen have unerring taste. She sent to the library for him. `What do you think of it, Percy?' she inquired, after showing him how finely it fitted her magnificent bust. `Is it not a rich pattern, and of a superb fashion?' `I know not which most to admire, the perfection of the fit or the skill of the artiste,' he said, looking with admiration at the beautiful milliner. `This must be Frank's inamorata, for she is just such a divine creature as he described,' he added to himself. `I will soon learn.' `You may go now, Percy, I don't want you any longer,' said the bride, with a meaning smile, observing his admiration of the maiden. `I want Frank to see your dress; he has perfect taste in such matters,' replied Percy. catching her eye and laughing, as he showed that he understood her ruse. `He is in the library, poring over Ovid's Art of Love. I will have him here in a moment.' `Don't bring Frank here!' she said, glancing at Caroline. `He must come.' When Frank entered the room, Caroline, with a throbbing bosom, instinctively shrunk within the window recess, her services not being immediately in requisition. `A superb fit, sis,' said Frank, `but let me tell you it is the least in the world a little too low in the—neck—I mean bosom.' `Not a bit, as the fashion is.' `If it were the fashion to—but I'm mum. How are your new teeth? Do you believe me, I think they are more beautiful than those you lost!' `Sh! brother!' and Mrs. Wharton directed her glance warningly towards the recess. But Caroline heard every word the young gentleman had uttered. With an involuntary exclamation she turned from the window and was gazing, when he looked, with surprise and curiosity upon Mrs. Wharton. `Caroline Archer!' Caroline was overwhelmed with confusion at the recognition and his ardent exclamation. `I knew it,' exclaimed Percy, half-aloud. `Do you know her, Frank?' asked Mrs. Wharton, suspiciously. `Look there!' he answered. And opening his pocket-book he displayed the miniature within. `Do you remember when I bought this in Paris.' `I do. It is perfect.' `It is only through this likeness I know her then, sister.' At this instant the door bell rung, and the next moment Dr. —, the dentist, entered the room. `I called as I was passing, Madam, to see how—what—my noble little heroine here!' `Do you know her too, Doctor?' asked Mrs. Wharton, with surprise `Pray let me look at your teeth, Miss,' cried the Doctor, without replying to her question, and walking directly up to Caroline—`I have wished a hundred times to see how they answered the purpose.' Caroline retreated in embarrassment, and felt as if she should sink upon the ground. `Do not be alarmed! you were courageous enough a few weeks ago. Well, Mrs. Wharton, so you have found her out and taken her as a protege.' `Found who out! Pray explain, Doctor.' `Why my brave, beautiful heroine!' `Whom do you mean?' `Why the pretty `advertisement girl,' as I call her.' Mrs. Wharton turned pale. `You do not mean to say that—that—' and the lady finished her sentence by a look directed towards Caroline. `That she is the young person who—' `No more, Doctor—I beg of you to e silent.' she cried imploringly, sinking upon an ottoman near her. `Pray, what is this mystery, Doctor? demanded the astonished Percy. `I see I have been led into a sad blunder by taking things for granted. But it is better to explain than leave things in mystery. This is the young woman who sacrificed her front teeth to supply the loss of your lady's.' `Emily, is this so?' demanded Percy, with indignant reproof. `Were not those manufactured teeth you obtained from Dr. —?' `No, Percy,' she answered, hiding her face in her hand. `Good God! have you had the cruelty to bribe a young creature like this to make such a sacrifice to your vanity! Alas, my dear Emma! you have fallen, fallen far in my estimation.' `Forgive me, Percy!' she cried, throwing herself upon his shoulder—`I confess my error—I have not been happy since!' `First make all the reparation in your power to this young creature, whom nothing but dire necessity could have driven to make such a sacrifice; and of this necessity the bride of Percy Wharton has taken advantage.' Mrs. Wharton burst into tears. `Nay, sir—pardon her!' cried Caroline, with generous feeling for the contrition of the unhappy lady. `The sacrifice I made was voluntary on my part and with Heaven's blessing was the means of saving a beloved mother from misery, and making a destitute family happy.' `And did you make such a sacrifice, noble girl, for a mother?' `Indeed, sir, we were very much distressed—and if Providence had not opened this way of relief to us, we should have been houseless wanderers of the streets.' `Emma, I forgive you, inasmuch as good has been permitted to grow out of this evil. Yet it does not exculpate you.' With great delicacy and tact Percy Wharton then drew from the blushing girl her whole story, save that part that transpired in the dentist's room, which Doctor — related with touching eloquence. Francis Astley also on his part related the loss and recovery of his pocket-book, and increased the admiration of Percy and his wife to the highest pitch. When the tale was ended, he asked if her father's name was not Henry Archer, formerly an importer in Front street?' `It was, sir,' answered Caroline.' `Then he did my father when he was a young man a great and important service. It shall be my pleasing duty to repay it to his child. Give me your mother's address, and I will call on her early to-morrow.' `And permit me to say, Miss Archer,' added Mrs. Wharton, approaching her and taking her hand, `that I shall insist on taking you henceforth under my protection, and from this moment request you will make my house your home, and look upon me as a sister.' `You are a noble creature, Emily, when you let your heart take the lead of your head,' said her husband, kissing her. `You have my consent to whatever you will.' `And if my good brother will give me his consent—and my generous sister will transfer also her proffered protection of this gentle girl,' said Francis Astley, advancing and taking Caroline's remaining hand, `I will with her sweet consent, cheerfully give my hand where weeks since I gave my heart.' He bent gracefully over the fair hand as he spoke, and imprinted upon it an ardent kiss. Caroline, overwhelmed with the sudden and unexpected crowding in of events, and with her full heart gushing joy at this reward of her long and silently cherished love for the handsome stranger of the gloves, stood with drooping eyelids, blushing like a peony, while her young bosom tumultuously heaved as if it would burst its confinement. It is two months since Caroline Archer left the boarding school of Mrs. —, Chesnut street, where she had been fifteen months; her betrothed husband, Mr. Frank Astley, being too impatient to be married and sport his lovely wife at the Springs this season, to wait the three years he had promised Percy. Therefore, yesterday there appeared in the Gazette the following notice under the Hymeneal head: `Married this morning at eight o'clock en costume des voyage, Francis Astley, Esq., of this city, to Miss Caroline Archer, daughter of the late Henry Archer, Esq The happy pair started immediately for Saratoga via New York. There is an on dit that some more than ordinary romance d'amour was the foundation of this union of the parties.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PRETTY FEET OR, THE WAY TO CHOOSE A WIFE. BY PROFESSOR INGRAHAM. Faultless in shape were both her beanteous feet As Eve's when freshly taken from their virgin mould, Rose tinted, delicately blue-veined, with nails Of blushing pearls. A hundred nameless charms and untold beauties lay Couched in the dimpled instep—bewitching hollow! O'er all, the line of beauty, undulating soft Evanished in grace! —Joseph Hott. One afternoon, after dinner, two young gentleman were seated in a private and luxuriously furnished apartment, at the Carlton House. The deep folds of the curtains were dropped across the windows, and the light of the western sun passing through them diffused a rich mellow glow throughout the room. One of the gentlemen occupied a sofa, lolling at full length, and the other was comfortably seated in a softly cushioned arm chair of velvet. They were both smoking, one a long slender clay pipe filled with fragrant Scarfalati, the other a bright brown Regalia! A decanter of the richest Sherry, such as Mr. Henry Hodges loves to give his particular friends, with an unopened bottle of Steinberger, and a cork-screw stood on a marble table within their reach. On the opposite sides of the table, where they had just replaced them, were wine glasses half-filled with the amethystine nectar, and glowing in the warm rich light from the curtains. Everything around them looked comfortable, and they appeared like gentlemen who particularly love to take their ease after dinner. The individual on the sofa was a very elegant fellow in a handsome dressing gown, with soft brown hair waiving to his collar, and a pair of dark whiskers arranged with great taste. His complexion was that dark-pearly hue, mingled with an agreeable red, so common to New York gentlemen, being smooth and delicate, yet healthy. His cheek was now a little flushed, and his dark hazel eyes brighter, and his lip redder than their wont. He was about twenty-six years of age, his name was Lionel Linton, and he was of good family and had very respectable connexions. He was unmarried, and having at his annual disposal an income of three thousand dollars, he had no profession, but lived an idle, indolent, fashionable life. He had every quality, however, calculated to make any reasonable woman a happy husband, being domestically inclined, good tempered, of an easy, amiable disposition, and frank and generous to a fault. He had good sense and judgment, and he had just began to feel that he was wasting life without having accomplished any adequate end for the gift of it, either for his own honor or the benefit of mankind! In fine he felt that he must get married! He had, therefore, been several months looking out for a wife, and had already seen in Broadway a young lady of great personal attractions, whom half resolved to make his wife if she would consent to be his. He had not, however, even spoken with her nor did he know who she was: that she was highly respectable, he was aware from having seen her walking in company with ladies whom he knew to belong to the highest condition in society! Such was the state and crisis of Lionel Linton's matrimonial prospects at the period of our story: and, now as he reclined there smoking, he could not help thinking how much prettier object a sweet bride would be seated, sewing or reading opposite to him in the place of his friend of the pipe, to look at! The young gentleman on the other side of the table, who had suggested this sensible reflection, was named Henry Lee, by the clergyman who christened him at Grace Church, but irreverent laymen invariably called him Harry Lee. He was a short, joyous looking young gentleman of about twenty-five, with a jovial round face, a bright twinkling blue eye, short curly brown hair, beautifully white teeth and a hand like a lady's for fairness, though something fat, for his whole person was inclined to corpulency, his abdomen already beginning to aspire to aldermanic dignity. He had his coat off and was in his shirt sleeves; his head was thrown back in an attitude of narcotic felicity as he puffed at his pipe; his short feet were stuck up, parallel to each other, over the back of a chair in front of him; his long pipe stem was supported delicately between a thumb and finger, and his whole attitude was one of fleshy luxury! Like his friend Lionel, he was a bachelor sojourner at the Cariton, and the recipient of something less than three thousand dollars per annum from an incumbered estate left him by his grand-father, who had been an influential burgher in the olden days of the city. He was a good natured, `whole souled fellow,' always smiling and looking like a happy dog; always mellow after dinner and very fond of kicking up rows and knocking down `Charles,' but all in good nature, for he was, as every one of his friends whom he lent money to swore, one of `the best-natured fellows in the world!' He had remained a bachelor because he could never find a woman that had a foot to please his fastidious eye! Harry's notions of female perfection were peculiar! He always judged woman by the shape and symmetry of her foot; it was with him literally ex-pede Herculem. If he had a passion for anything besides tipping over `Charlies,' and for a good glass of brown Sherry, it was for a neat and faultless foot! His glance as he would promenade that `walk of beauty,' Broadway, was always directed to the feet of the pretty women, their walk and manner of placing the foot to the pavement. He has been heard to deliver a lecture by the hour, after dinner, on a lady's foot! If Harry, therefore, ever chose a wife he would be sure to select her rather for a divine foot than a divine face. But, though, tired of living at hotels and being alone so much in his rooms, and anxious to get a wife, he had never yet found any one to suit him! `I say, my dear boy,' he said after a long and reflecting silence, and without removing the stem of his pipe from his lips, or turning his head; `I say, Linton, I have been thinking we are a brace of precious fools.' `So have I just been thinking the same thing, Harry,' replied Lionel, emitting from his mouth a wreath of rich blue tobacco smoke and sending it curling above his head. `But what has brought you to this conclusion.' `Thinking what a poor devil's life I lead here when there is some lovely creature, if I knew where to find her, with a foot like an angel, stepping on rosy clouds, ready to make me a happy fellow! Only think how charming it would be to have a pretty wife setting beside me to fill my pipe, and two or three sweet little cherubs of boys and girls to ride across my legs as I have 'em stretched across the chair, and call me `Papa!' What led you, Linton, to say `Amen' to it so readily, hey?' `Thinking of pretty much the same thing, to tell the truth,' said Lionel Linton, coloring and laughing. `I am half of a mind, Harry, to turn Benedict, in good earnest;' and the handsome Lionel Linton smoked his segar for a few puffs with more animation than before. `Yes, Linton,' said Harry, taking out his pipe from his mouth and pricking the bowl, `that is very easily said; but where in the deuce is the wife to come from?' `There are hundreds of beautiful women in New York, of our acquaintance; we could soon pick out a good wife, Harry, if we would only make up our minds to marry!' `But a beautiful woman is one thing, and a beautiful woman with a pretty foot is another. I always find something deficient!' `But we must not look for physical perfection in the sex, Harry. I am satisfied with a lovely face and figure, which is the casket of a good heart and generous mind; I can forgive a woman who possesses these, if she should happen to wear No. 3's.' `Number threes!' exclaimed Harry, `I would'nt look at a woman who wore number threes, in seeking for a wife! Number one in summer—No. 1 1-2 in winter, is my standard of perfection! Number threes!' `But number threes may be in just proportion, nevertheless, to the lady's figure! if she be tall and noble sized! I have seen ladies with too small feet for their size, and it was a glaring deformity!' `That may be, too, Linton! What I want is a wife whose person shall be moulded in the divinest mould of female symmetry: a just hand and foot—a just height and proportion to the charming whole! But I would not marry a girl with a face like an angel and with a form like Juno's if she wore number threes!' `Then you want a petite wife, that you can tuck under your arm like an umbrella.' `No, not that! A woman may be a warm and living Venus de Medici, aud wear no larger shoe than a French number one! I have measured the foot of the Venus, and found it exactly ones. And would you call a girl the size and proportions of a Venus de Medici, a petite to be tucked under my arm like an umbrella?' Harry in the heat of his argument had turned round full to Linton who could not help smiling at his earnest manner. `Well, well, Harry, yoo may marry for the foot and I will marry for the face and its expression!' `Expression!' repeated Harry; `why, my dear fellow, there is much expression in a woman's foot, as in her face!' `Ha! ha! ha!' laughed Linton; `you are fairly crazy, upon the subject, my dear fellow!' `It is true,' repeated Harry, drinking off his glass; `will you deny there is expression in forms?' `How do you mean?' `An outline and shape. For instance is there no expression in a profile?' `To be sure.' `Is there any in a forehead—in its mere outline?' `I think there is.' `Think! I know there is. Painters and sculptors will tell you there is. Did you ever see Daniel Webster's forehead, or Charles Sprague's?' `Yes.' `Well, will you say that there is no individuality of expression in these features?' `I think I understand you.' `How can you help it? Form that has life in it possesses individual expression—has its own proprium. Have you seen a hand that you could say of it, `this is the hand of an assassin—this of an avaricious man—this of a benevolent man?' `This is a strange theory, Harry. Did you find it in the floating smoke of your Scarfalati, or discover it in the bottom of your emptied wine-glass. `Nature and truth taught it me, and they teach it to every man who will learn of them, I contend that there is infinite expression in a woman's foot! A perfect foot, neat, shapely, airy, and daintily turned, has an expression to my mind identical with that which constitutes our abstract ideas of beauty! The character of the woman is discovered by it—for the outline and outward grace of the body is the index of the being that dwells in it. Now low, coarse or vulgar woman could never express to the eye a self-contradiction.' `Henry's Sherry has mounted you on the top of metaphysics, Harry,' said Lionel, laughing, yet half inclined to assent to the truth of his doctrine on the female `understanding.' `You may believe what I say or not, Linton, but I am morally convinced of its truth! By Heaven, I would be willing to choose a wife by her foot, without seeing her face!' `You would, Harry?' `I would, upon my honor.' `Well, then, let us both decide this very moment to marry and look out each for his wife. I will choose mine for her face,' he added gaily, if you will chose one for her foot!' `Done,' cried Harry, getting up and grasping Linton's hand, `and I will bet you I will get the fairest wife.' `Done be it,' said Linton, returning the grasp of his hand; `suppose, Harry, we decide to select one, you by the foot, I by the face, this very afternoon! Broadway is now, and will be for the next two hours, tronged with the beauty of the city! If men who are to select wives by the eye cannot choose in such a galaxy of loveliness, they deserve to go blind.' `But, suppose, we should find out afterwards on inquiry, that they were engaged?' said Harry, a little posed by this extraordinary proposition from his friend, who very well knew he should meet the young lady there whose beauty, as he daily passed her at the hour of promenade, had made such an impression upon him. `In that case, Harry, we will both try again,' he answered gaily. `Come, let us sally forth on our matrimonial expedition.' `Agreed, Linton; I will bring myself to the agreement,' said Harry, with animation, pouring out a glass of sherry; `let us toast our future wives.' Linton joined him, and the toast was drank standing. Harry now put on his trock coat, and the more finical Linton his dress coat, while both paid more than their usual attention after dinner, to their toilet. `Now, Harry, we are to choose a wife this afternoon, at all events, from some one we see between this and sun-set—that is decided!' `De—de—decided,' repeated Harry, who was just mellow enough to be very happy.— `But s'pose, Linton, s'pose she won't have us! That would be a fix, hey?' `That will of course absolve us from our mutual pledge, Harry! I am resolved to have a wife in earnest, if I can get one.' `And if we don't, Lion', boy, let's ad—advertise for—for—one—pretty foot, hey?' `Come, Harry; don't take any more wine! You have got just enough to make you a good judge of a pretty foot!' `Have I, Lion'? Well, I wont! But it's a pity to leave such a nice bottle of Stein wine for per—perquisites to that tip—tippling waiter, Pete. Do I vibrate, Lint?' `No, Harry; your legs are steady enough, but your tongue is confoundedly drunk.' `I will not p—po—pop the question, then, if I see a p—pr—pretty foot, 'till it gets sober.' `No; we are to follow, without attracting particular observation, each our prize 'till we ascertain where she lives, and then devise means to be introduced to her family; and then hey for love and matrimony!' said Linton with a little excitement in his manner. `The idea, Linton, between you and I, the idea of marrying makes me feel weak about the s—st—stomach!' `Courage, mon ami! en avant!' and the two candidates for matrimony sallied forth from their hotel arm in arm, and fell into the mingling currents that flowed along the western and fashionable pave. Caroline Le Roy stood before her full length toilet-glass, surveying her lovely person, which was tastefully arrayed in a rich walking dress. A fashionable hat was on her head, the snowy plumes of which as they depended to her shoulder, were mocked by the brilliancy of the ermine throat and cheek it delicately shaded! Her features were of that lovely and softly rounded outline which is peculiar to American females in their teens; and she was but nineteen. Her eyes were blue, large and full of tenderness, with a serene, spiritual expression! Her figure was tall and harmoniously graceful, conveying in every motion that kind of pleasure to the eye that harmony of numbers does to the ear! Her beauty was faultless, save the hand and foot! the first, though covered by an unsullied pea-green glove of the softest kid, was too large for the arm, as if she had spread it, by the foolish plan in vogue of placing girls at the piano before they can clasp an octave, and so compelling them to spread the fingers 'till the hand looks webbed-like, like, we were about to say a shark's fin; in this manner had Caroline Le Roy evidently disfigured and distorted her hand! It was a great pity, for it was as white as down, and veined on the back with the most delicate pencilling of blue. But she had not the same apology for her foot! It was too large to admit of any apology, and cramped in number threes, though it was a good number four! Now, a large foot is very bad, but a large foot cramped into a shoe a number too small, is worse still! A large foot cannot be helped, but a pinched foot can! It plumps it up on the top, destroying the easy outline; it draws in the instep, spoiling the walk, and is a source of ceaseless torment and pain to the owner, Whatever size be the foot, let its shoe neatly fit it, and then if it be not so small, it at least will not be deformed!— These observations are extracted from a journal lately kept by Harry Lee! Miss Virginia Le Roy glanced over her costume and person with a look of satisfaction; but her eyes did, for one instant, linger with disapproval on her feet, and she sighed to think it was not a little smaller, for she was one of those who look upon a small foot as a mark of high aristocratic birth. She took her sun-shade in her hand, and leaving her door in Eighth street, was, a few moments afterwards, on Broadway, wishing— half hoping she should meet that handsome fellow in brown hair, who had so often passed her with a respectful look of ardent, yet modest admiration. She had not gone far, when a young graceful little Hebe, dressed half like a woman, half like a school-girl, about seventeen years of age, came tripping towards her from Bleecker street. A smile was on her face, a light in her bright black eyes, and her beautiful hand extended to take that of her friend. `How do you do, Virginia?' `How do you do, Ellen?' And their lips met in a warm kiss of girlish friendship. `Are you going down Broadway?' `Yes—to Stewarts', for a mantle.' `I was going to Madame Canda's, to call on Julia Carrol; but, as it is early yet, I will join you,' said the new comer, and the young ladies proceeded down Broadway side by side, and in animated conversation. A lovelier or more spirituelle creature than Ellen Leigh could not be conceived to exist on this lower earth. Her form was slight, yet full, and faultless to the eye of the most fastidious! Her face was, however, not so beautiful as it was sensible and intelligent! Her extraordinary beauty lay in the grace and expression of her figure. Her ungloved hand, as she took Virginia Le Roy's, was small, tapering, and white as the lily and seemingly as purely soft in texture. Her waist was enchantment! but her foot! Spirit and shade of Harry Lee! where wert thou? It was divine—literally divine! How can such just perfection be described? They were so small that you could compass them across the instep; harmonious in all their fascinat ing proportions and undulating outline, with a bewitching movement as she tripped along, like two sweet birds lighting and alighting along the pavement! Their expression was actually joyous, to speak after Harry's theory. They were encased in a pair of the prettiest French laced boots, of a delicate fawn color, that seemed to be a part and parcel of the graceful feet they covered. `Where have you been for an age, Ellen?' asked Caroline, glancing at her feet, with an envious feeling in her heart. `To Troy, for three months past. How delighted I am to get back to the city! It is so dull out of New-York. Dear delightful Broadway! how happy I am to be in it once more. Are you engaged yet to any body Caro?' `Engaged, Ellen, why no!' `I suppose your favorite song, then is— `Why don't the men propose mama, Why don't the men propose?' `What a rattle brain! I shan't think of marrying till I am twenty.' `And you are over nineteen now! I mean to marry soon as I find a good, clever, nice, handsome, light-hearted, good natured fellow, who will let me do just as I want to, and never scold me! There comes two handsome young fellows! I don't like the tall one —he looks too grave and morbid! The shorter one looks like a merry gentleman `after dining out!' Why how you blush, Caroline—and how the tall handsome one stares at you! Did you ever see him before? And, good Heavens, how the other is watchiug my feet as he approaches! I wonder if my boot is untied? Yes, I declare it is, and the silk cord trailing in the dust!' By this time our matrimonial speculating heroes had come up nearly abreast of them. Lionel had recognized at a distance, one of them as his unknown beauty, and Harry had discovered the other to have the most symmetrical feet his imagination had ever conceived of. Both gentlemen, therefore insensibly lessened their pace when they approaehed them, one with his admiring eyes the while resting on the embarrassed, yet pleased Caroline's blushing face, the other with his rapturous gaze fixed on the feet that had fascinated it. They forgot to give way to the young ladies, who fairly turned aside for them, when they recovered their self-possession, and looked back! Caroline, also, at the same instant, glanced back, and Ellen, stopping, placed her foot on the inner curb-step of the walk that runs beneath the windows, to fasten her boot. Harry was just mellow enough to act from impulse, and hastening towards her, asked with a smile and a polite bow, that from him was irresistable, and which it was impossible to take offence at. `Will you allow me, miss, to fasten that truant chord in the envious position to which it seems so insensible?' and Harry gracefully bent on one knee. Ellen looked at him, at the first instant, gravely; but seeing how very modest and civil his address was, and his words so complimentary withal, she replaced the foot which she had withdrawn from the stone to make her retreat from him, and said laughingly, `You may tie it if you please, sir—it is very awkward to have one's boot or shoe un-unlaced in the street.' `Very,' replied Harry, entwining the silken chord around the bewitching ancle, his senses, however, so bewildered by the sight and touch of so exquisite a foot, that he worked very bunglingly. `You must not press my foot, sir,' she said with a laugh and frown at the same time on her face. `There, sir, I am extremely obliged to you,' she said, archly, as Harry rose to his feet. `You can tie boots very well,' and rejoining Caroline Le Roy, she tripped on her way without looking back. `Irony, there,' said Harry, looking after her, `but what a foot! Linton, I am in for it. Did you see that divine foot?—French number ones!' `Confound your No. ones. Did you see that heavenly face?' `Confound your face! Did you observe her symmetrical hand?—hands and feet are always of the same suit.' `Did you notice her tall and graceful figure? ----face and figure always go together.' `What a laugh!' `What an eye!' `What a fawn-like movement!' `What a Juno-like tread!' `You are speaking of the tall one, Linton.' `Your are speaking of the shorter one, Harry.' `So I am.' `And so am I.' `Are you for the tall one, in earnest, Linton?' `Yes. And are you for the short one in truth?' `Yes. Such a foot never was before!' `Nor such a face and figure!' `As mine?' `As mine!' `Let us follow them, Linton, and find out where they are! Oh, my poor heart!' `It is a gone case with both of us, Harry.' `I fear so!' and Harry sighed while he took Linton's arm, and leisurely walked after the two ladies, who, soon seeing that the two gentlemen, in relation to whom each had begun to feel a little curiosity, led them a long pursuit down Broadway, and back to Bleeker, when Ellen took leave of her friend, concluding instead of going to Madame Canda's, to return home. `I wish,' she said, as they parted, `I knew who that gentleman is that I so foolishly let tie my boot! He has presumed upon it to follow me 'till now! He has a handsome, cheerful, good natured face, which I like.' `I have more curiosity to learn who the taller one is,' said Caroline. I have often met him, and he always tries to meet my eyes. He is evidently a gentleman, and though they seem to follow us, they do so without positive rudeness. `Smitten with you, Caroline, and anxious to know where you live.' `And the other is then with you,' retorted Coroline, blushing. `We will see when I go down the street.' `The one you like will follow you home to see where you reside.' `And the one you like, will follow you.' `We will soon see,' said Caroline Le Roy, laughing. `And that shall decide which of them we are to have for husbands,' said Ellen gaily, having given utterance to more truth than she was aware of. The young ladies now separated, each walking towards her own residence and our heroes soon afterwards gaining the corner of Bleecker street, parted from each other— Harry to lounge down this street, keeping his intended bride in view, and Linton continuing along Broadway at an elegant leisurely gait—the one 'till he saw Ellen Leigh, nor unseen by her, enter her father's door, and the other, 'till he had satisfied himself where the beautiful girl lived, whose charms had produced such an effect upon his heart. It was not a very difficult matter now, that these important discoveries were made by our heroes, for them to obtain, through acquaintances an introduction to the houses of their singularly selected wives! They soon became intimately acquainted with them, formally addressed them, and were accepted; but then the fair betrothed were ignorant of their mutual pledge to each other over their glasses, to choose wives as they did, or perhaps it is very possible they might have said `no,' when they would have had them say `yes.' They both, however, had fairly fallen in love with their intended brides after becoming acquainted with them, and perhaps this fact should be accepted in atonement. At length they were married, and went in company together to Saratoga, the Falls; and came home again after a few weeks' absence, to enter upon the responsible duties of house-keeping. Harry found his wife's foot proved indeed the index of her mind, that her heart was as good and true as her beautiful foot was unrivalled in symmetry and grace. Linton's wife was as lovely in temper as she was in person; and though Harry said he could never forgive her for having a foot, yet he could not but frankly confess to Linton his conviction that a woman might make a very good wife, though she wore number threes!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II. `Jealousy, with just cause, is virtue. Groundless it hath no evil equal to't.' Two years passed away, two years of uninterrupted connubial happiness, and each of our lovely brides had become mothers! Never was a man so delighted at being a parent, as Harry Lee, and of a bright, healthy boy, too, on which he could brag over his friend Lionel, whose beautiful wife presented him with a little girl; but as it was the perfect miniature of his loved Caroline, he was as well satisfied as Harry, though Harry's boy was the picture of his `papa,' `This is better than being a bachelor, hey, Linton?' said Harry, one day, when they had dined together at Lionel's house, and the ladies had left the table to look after their treasures in the nursery. `What a delightful creature my wife is! I advise every man to choose his wife for her pretty foot!' `Pshaw, Harry,' said Lionel, filling his wine-glass with ruby Port. `Caroline has rather a larger foot, perhaps, than I should like myself, but she makes as good a wife as if she had the feet of a Chinese beauty. I would't change her for any lady that wears number ones that I have ever seen.' `Not for Ellen? My heavens, Linton, you must have a gross taste, not to admire Ellen's sweet little feet. My boy has got small feet, too—devilish small! But then it don't signify so much in a boy!' `Here's a bumper to him, Harry! and may he get a wife as lovely as his father has obtained.' `And with as small feet,' added Harry, with a cheek flushed with wine, drinking off the bumper. `Confound your small feet, Harry! Why, what kind of extremities would your grandchildren have, in such case!' `If they are girls, angelic ones!' replied Harry, with animation. `But, by-the-by, Lionel, have you and your pretty wife had any matrimonial scenes together since you have been married?' `How do you mean?' asked Linton, slightly coloring, and looking into his wine glass, as if watching the reflection of his face. `Any little misunderstandings, squabbles, you know, eh?' repeated Harry, with a merry twinkle in his mellow eyes. `Why, no, not particularly, I believe,' answered Linton, embarrassed in his manner. `Why do you ask?' `Why, between you and me, Lionel, I think she speaks a little sharper to you on occasions than a sweet tempered wife should do.' `Indeed,' said Linton laughing and blushing, `how did you discover that?' `Oh, by accident, several times! But you didn't seem to observe it—at least, very wisely paid no attention to her, and so it passed. And I said to myself, I'll bet two to one, Linton hasn't so sweet tempered a wife as I have. She has, to tell you the truth, a little too large a foot to be perfectly sweet tempered. From more harmony and symmetry of person, would have followed perfect harmony and symmetry of disposition.' `But hold, Harry! has your wife never shown any temper? Have you never had any of these matrimonial scenes you speak of, eh, boy? Now out with the truth'—and Lionel glanced at the door, and lowered his voice—`we are alone.' `Never, 'pon my honor, Linton! She is invariably the same happy, cheerful creature, with a most delightful disposition. She loves me to devotion, and I repay her love with adoration.' `Do you adore her, or her foot, Harry?' `Her foot is the altar of the temple in which my love worships! I kneel to that, but my adoration is to the spirit that fills the fair temple.' `You are poetical, Harry! I believe you speak truly of Ellen! She is indeed lovely in her disposition.' `Will you be as frank now about Caroline,' said Harry, laughing and casting a mischievous glance at his friend. `Well, to tell you the truth, Harry.' he said in a subdued tone, with his eye upon the door through which the two wives had passed to the nursery, `Caroline has but one fault! She is, naturally, the best tempered, generous, noble-minded creature in the world, but she is—is—' `Out with it; jealous of Ellen's pretty feet.' `No, but jealous of me.' `Of you! of you, most chaste and noble Joseph!' cried Harry, laughing; `ha, ha, ha! And who is the fair lady whose charms are so dangerous to her peace?' `Your wife, Harry,' said Linton, with a quiet smile. `My wife,' cried Harry, looking all at once very grave; `what the devil—what can she think you have to do with my wife?' `I can't tell,' replied Linton, amused at Harry's sudden flash of incipient jealousy. `Look here, Linton, have you been flirting with Ellen, now?' seriously asked Harry, with a most melancholy expression to his usually cheerful features. `Tell me the truth, and I'll forgive you—I will, upon my soul.' `As I am a gentleman, and a man of honor, no, my dear boy,' replied Linton, with a sincerity, yet scarcely refraining from laughter at his friend's very serious visage. `I knew it, my dear boy, Linton, I knew it could not be so,' said Harry, giving a long breath: `you don't know how devilish bad I felt. Ellen loves me with all her soul—but then these women are women, and there is no knowing how to take them! The best way is to keep a sharp eye on them! heh, heh, heh! Linton?' `Yes, if you want them to run away when you go to sleep! A husband's frank and open confidence in his wife, is the safest security to his martial honor.' `I believe you, Linton! If wives are false, it is the husbands that teach them the first lesson. I have ever had the most unlimited confidence in Ellen? I regret that I should for an instant, have believed she would flirt even with you—for flirtation in a wife, is the first rehearsal of inconstancy.' `You utter a severe truth, Harry.' `Truth is always severe,' answered Harry, with a dignity that became the tone of his thoughts at that moment. `But how is it that Caroline has become jealous of you? and of Ellen, too! It must have been of her feet!' `I can hardly conceive. She first manifested it one day about four months ago, when your Ellen, nurse and boy, were at my house, and we were comparing babies.' `I recollect the time, perfectly,' said Harry cracking an almond, yet listening with deep interest. `I then remarked, for you have talked so much about small feet being essential to beauty in woman, I had, in part, imbibed your foolish notions, taking up my little Ellen's foot, when she grew up, would be as small as and pretty as her's.' `Yes, yes, I remember, and Caroline spoke up rather sharply, rather more so at least, than became a loving wife of two years, and said, while her cheek heightened its hue, `I wish you had married Ellen, then, if you think a small foot so very desirable.' Yes I recollect that perfectly, and it is one of the occasions I alluded to. She is jealous, as I told you, not of you, but of my wife's feet! I exonerate you fully.' `It amounts to the same thing which she is jealous of. She plainly envies Ellen! But it is my fault, as well as yours, too, Harry; for we have put the idea into her head! I shouldn't be surprized if it should be productive of much misery to her.' `Indeed, I trust not so serious a result,' said Harry, with a look of solitude. `But then women have made themselves wretched, and their husbands, too, for more trifling matters. But this occurred four months ago. She has forgotten it now.' `No—but it grows worse. Ellen never comes to see us, that after she leaves, she does not have a fit of those delightful little pouting pantomimes, the sulks the whole day.' `The duece she does! And how does she treat Ellen?' `Latterly, with increasing coldness. Have you not observed it?' `By Heaven, I have! I heard her at dinner, as I was uncorking a bottle of Port, reply to something Ellen said about her going down to Lane's with her, after dinner, and get some pairs of shoes, as I thought, in a very ill-humored way, as I judged, by the tone; but looking up, and seeing Ellen look ing as smiling as ever—what a delightful wife I've got, Linton!—I concluded I had imagined the ill-humor. But then Ellen is so sweet tempered, nothing Caroline could say to her, would move her.' `One would think you lauded Ellen so profusely, Harry, to show Caroline in a darker shade! But I hope she will, by-and-by, have good sense enough to get over it.' `And I increased the flame to-day, too.— Don't you remember that I was thoughtless enough, I see now, talking about a pretty woman I had met down town, who was faultless, save her feet, which I said, were not only large, but that she used them as if a young lady's feet were absolutely given her merely to walk with, as wheels are put under a locomotive, that it may go somehow over the ground, instead of being, as Heaven designed them, the loveliest features of beauty, given her as wings are given angels, to transfer her person from place to place, revealing, in the act the harmony and dignity that dwells in motion!' `I remember laughing at you, Harry.' `But your wife didn't laugh!' `No.' `No. She looked as grave as a prude.' `I should have been pleased if she had only looked grave. She looked very angry, in my opinion.' `Well, I said grave, out of respect for your feelings, Lionel. She did look mad! And I was struck at the reflection, how ill anger sits on a pretty face! Evil passions are all ugly, and the contrast is so great when they display thsmselves in a beautiful countenance, like Mrs. Linton's for instance, that the effect is singularly unpleasing. On harsh, homely faces, there is less contrast, and the effect is less striking. I recollect a beautiful girl of eighteen, I once saw very angry. She reminded me of angel fallen! But I am very sorry I have said anything to make Caroline envious of Ellen. Two such friends! What a sad affair it would be, if this should dissever their friendship.' `I fear it will!' said Linton, gravely; it were indeed to be regretted. Confound your mania for pretty feet, Harry!' `I will say `amen,' if it is to be the cause of mingling alloy in your cup of connubial happiness. Caroline is such a lovely and generous minded woman, too!' `Yes, there is only this to mar our felicity. In all else she is an incomparable creature, Harry.' `I will make Ellen wear No. 3's!' said his friend, warmly. `No, no! let it work its own cure.' `But it won't. Let a woman that loves her husband, once get the idea into her head that he admires another woman for some point of character she does not possess, or possessing less perfection, she will soon believe that his admiration extends to the whole woman, and that he loves her better than herself. So ripe jealousy comes of it; as Dow, Jr. would say in his very excellent Patent Sermons, `her thoughts will sit brooding in the nest of suspicion, upon the eggs of envy, till they hatch the little chickens of jealousy.' These chickens must be plucked ere they get full feathered.' `How can it be done, Harry?' asked Lionel, with an interest that called forth his friend's sympathy. `Caroline's person and figure are faultless, and though she wears No. 3's, if she had a foot for No. 2's, it would be a deformity. She is full three sizes in person larger than Ellen, and her foot is not a hair's breadth too large for her.' `This I have always said, Harry.' `And so have I. I said that I would not marry a woman who wore a number higher than a French one. I say so now! I married such a woman! But I did not say a woman's foot could not be perfectly beautiful even with number fives. She may be tall enough, and majestic enough to require such a foot! How would Mrs. Siddons have looked with a foot like Ellen's! absurd and deformed!' `You are changing your tactics, Harry,' said Linton, laughing. `Not a shadow! I have always spoken as I do. I only have always said I liked not a woman with a large foot; and a woman with too large a foot, which is very common, I cannot endure.' `What are you coming to, Harry?' `To this point. Caroline's notions must be reversed, or, rather, she must have her ideas on this subject corrected. As I have been mainly instrumental in giving her such notions, in which both she and you have misunderstood me, I must do my best to make matters right again.' `I wish to mercy you would, Harry, if possible; for, to tell you the truth, it is ringing in my ears from morning 'till night. `What, does she box them?' asked Harry, refilling very deliberately his champaign glass, and looking up with a smile, `Not quite—but it is almost as bad. The other morning I happened to knock one of her shoes aside with my foot, in crossing the chamber, and she instantly cried, `You'd not have kicked Ellen Lee's shoe in that way! It is just because I wear a larger one than she does, you treat me so;' and so she burst into tears, got into bed again, and got up at eleven o'clock with swollen eyes, as silent as a mule.' `Well, upon my soul, Linton, I am sorry. But I have a plan to appeal to her good sense.' `What is it? name it, for Heaven's sake.' `I was in Launitz's gallery last week, and saw there, as I entered the door, a statue of Dian, in casque, quiver, and sandal shoon! I stood still without advancing nearer, and gazed a long time on the figure, admiring its just proportions and faultless symmetry; particulularly was I fascinated with the foot, which was as beautiful as Ellen's.' “How is it,' said I, after surveying it awhile, and turning round to the sculptor, `how is it, Launitz, that every statue of the mythological beauties is just the size of the Medician Venus?” “This is not,' he said, pointing to the statue of the divine huntress. `The Venus personifies Love, and is, therefore, small in staure, for grace and love are more appropriately and delicately illustrated by lessening the real. Diana personifies woodland sports— she is the genius of the chase! She is therefore some inches taller than the genius of love, that she may be fleet of foot, and light, that she may pursue with swiftness! You observe her feet are slender and larger than those of the Medici, which is to your left; and they should be so, to preserve the poetical truth of the character.' `You do not mean to say this statue of Dian is taller than the Venus de Medici,' I exclaimed with surprise, approaching it. `Three inches!' he said, smiling; `its perfect symmetry has deceived you!' `Indeed it has,' said I, as I went close up to it, when I saw that he had spoken the truth. Yet the symmetry of person was so well maintained, that a few steps off, I could have sworn it was not taller than Ellen, or the foot larger than her's—' `And yet—' `And yet it was, for I measured it, just the height of your wife, and the foot half inch longer than her's!' `Excellent. And that has conceited you to the belief that in symmetry may lie the true principles of beauty, and not in the foot.' `No, not exactly, but that a foot may be large, and yet be faultless.' `Good, my dear Harry, very good! Now you are getting reasonable' `Not a jot more so than I have been; for I yield nothing, concede nothing of what I have advocated. I have only learnt something additional.' `Well, and how are you going to make this knowledge avail me in the matter of Caroline's growing envy.' `By taking her in to-morrow, as if by accident, in passing by, to see this statue, and with Launitz's explanation of the true principles of beauty as they exist in one and the other; Dian and Venus, and with a little tact on my part, and address on your own, we will make her in perfect good humor with herself. Nay, I will wager she would afterwards turn up her pretty nose at such a little foot as Ellen's. I will call by at your house, for you, as I come down from Bond street.' `You are a clever dog, Harry,' cried Linton, grasping his hand with a brightning eye. `It shall be as you say—Caroline shall go to-morrow. I hope this attempt to reconvert her, will succeed!' `Never doubt it, Lionel! Come, let us take a bumper to your lovely Diana!' `And I will toast your Venus, Harry.' `Capital—our wives are both Goddesses, and Dian shall reign in the empire of her own chaste beauty, as well as Venus in that of love. Come, Linton, another glass.' `No, Harry.' `Well, I will finish this bottle alone, then; you keep good wine! By-the-by, a friend sent me a present of a dozen of that fine old Paulding's Pale we used to drink so much of, when we were at the hotel. Do you sigh for those days, Linton.' `No, Harry, not if I could get Caroline over this fit of jealousy.' `Envy, not jealousy, my boy. Don't fear but all will come out straight. She has been sighing to be a Venus—we must convince her she is a goddess, dear! You must come down and help me to drink up that sherry. By-the-by, that nice fellow, Sinclair, wrote me a note he had just received a private importation of `Londou Particular,' and wants me to call at his house, to prove it. I had like to forgot it. I must quit you, Harry, for I would not miss Sinclair's wine, for nothing. Your port is capital! peh, peh! It has a rich warm flavor like Burgundy. Come to morrow, at eleven. Make my excu-cuse to the la-ladies, and tell Ellen I'll—that is you'll go home with her. There she is now, l-loo-looking l-like—l-like a p-p-p-pr-pretty foo-f-f-f-t.' `Why, Harry, you're tipsy,' said Ellen, coming in at that moment! `Lionel, how could you let Harry help himself to so much wine, when you know—' `Y-yes—Lionel kn-knows, Ellen—Lionel knows—' articulated, or rather stuttered the very mellow Harry Lee, as he attempted to cross from the table to the door. `Where are you going, Harry?' said Ellen, laughing, as he `vibrated' like an inverted pendulum, as he tried to walk particularly upright, and deluded himself with the idea that he did so. `I'm going home—no—yes, I'm going home!' `To go to bed, I dare say. Harry, why will you take so much wine, when a very little affects you so easily?' `G-t-t get used to it, Ellen—I never'll get used t-t-t-to it, if I don't, don't, don't get used to it. Did you know that?' `I know you shan't go home, but you shall lie down on the sofa, here, and take a short nap, and I will bathe your forehead with Cologne.' `Oh, wo-woman, in our hours of ease. Uncertain, c-co-coy and hard to please. B-bu-t when m-mistortune clouds the brow. A ministering angel, thou!' Yes, that's dear woman, and them's my sentiments.' And thus speaking in an amusingly drunken manner, Harry Lee suffered his wife to lead him to the sofa, where he soon fell asleep. Lionel drew his chair near Ellen, as she fanned Harry's heated brow, and began to chat with her on the ordinary topics of the day, when Caroline came in, and seeing them so near together, though a chair's space separated them, she cast an angry glance at her husband, a revengeful one at Ellen, and immediately retired, giving the door a bang-to behind her. `What is the matter with Caroline, to-day?' anxiously inquired Ellen, unsuspecting her innocent agency in causing her ill-humor. `I can't tell you—you must ask Harry, when he wakes up from his nap,' said Lionel, with a sad smile, as he rose to follow his wife, to soothe her; though he ought to have known ere this, that an angry woman is hest let alone. Persuasion irritates; anger makes her worse; humble yourself, and she despises you; condemn yourself falsely, and she treats you as if you were really in the fault. If she loves you, she will soon be sorry and seck reconciliation; if she does not care for you, she will get pleased, lest she spoil her beauty; for every pretty woman knows nothing is so poisonous to the complexion as anger; nothing destroys beauty so quickly as frowns! These judicious sayings are taken from an `Old Booke,' entitled `Sweete Advisement to Hushands and Wyfes to ye furthurance of theer Hymeneal amicability.' Mrs. Linton had retreated to her chamber, and locked the door! Lionel tried the knob once or twice, and then spoke in a low tone, with his mouth to the key-hole. `Caroline?' No reply. `Dear Caroline'—a little louder. No reply. `Sweetest Caroline, won't you answer?' No reply. `Caro, dear, let me in.' A pause. No reply. Lionel listened a moment, and then sigh ing heavily, and wishing all feet, little and big, to —, he turned to go down stairs.— But Mrs. Linton did not intend to let him go back to Ellen's society; she had quit the room to make him leave her, as she knew him well enough to know he would follow her, if he saw her go out angry. So, as Lionel reached the head of the stairs he heard her door open. He looked back, but she was not visible, but the door was wide spread.— He returned, and softly entered. Caroline was seated in a rocking chair, with her back towards him, rocking very resolutely. He closed the door and approached her. She did not turn her head, but kept on rocking and biting her thumb nail. He knelt on one knee beside her, and took the hand that lay on the arm of the chair, but she pulled it away with a jerk. He sighed heavily, and after a few seconds' silence, attempted to take the other, on which she was leaning her cheek. She snatched it away from him and kicked the cricket over. `Caroline, my sweet wife, how have I offended you?' The `sweet wife' bit her nail the harder, and kept her eyes fixed on vacancy, `Are you angry because I was talking with Ellen?' `No!' she replied in a tone so angry, that it started him; and swinging her chair smartly round, she left him at her back. `What are you put out about, then?' he asked, now almost angry himself. `Nothing.' `You are short and sweet. If I have unintentionally given you offence, I ask your forgiveness, Caroline,' he said calmly, but firmly; `I can't remain here to see you conduct yourself in this manner.' `I suppose not, while Ellen Lee is down stairs.' `What is Ellen Lee to me, that I should desire her society to my dear Caroline's?' he said, taking her hand, which she instantly withdrew from him. Mrs. Linton remained silent, but still rocking very perseveringly, and then, at length replied in that cross and querulous tone, so difficult to reply to safely, `You like her because she has a small foot.' `Upon my honor, Caroline, you wrong me I have no thought of any one but you!' `I know you love her! I know what you think about a wife's foot! You ought to have looked at my feet before you married me!' `I wish to gracious I had,' was Lionel's thought, but he did not speak it aloud. ' see Harry was a more sensible man than I took him for! Well, Caro, what is to be done? Are you to be angry all the evening and expose yourself to Ellen?' `Ellen, again! Ellen—it's all Ellen!' repeated the lady, with sneering mockery, giv-giving offence to her beautiful features. `I expect it is with her `Lionel, dear Lionel, nothing but `Lionel, all the time! `What has possessed you, Caroline?' `Nothing more than usual,' she answered, suddenly changing her manner, ceasing to rock, and taking up a book began to read it. She looked as calm and placid as a summer's morn! He gazed at her with surprize and perplexity. He had been married, however. but two years, and this was but a brief apprenticeship to a pretty and especially a jealous wife's whims. He did not know that this was but another phase of her displeasure; but believing she had become pleasant, he put his arm about her to kiss her, when he received a slap with the book on the cheek, that created quite a revolution in his ideas. Without a word he patiently bore it, and stood gazing upon her with surprize. If he had lived all his life a bachelor, he felt it would not have taught him so much about woman as he had learned in the last ten minutes. He was silent and enduring, for he remembered that she was the `weaker vessel,' and that he had pledged himself to love and cherish her. He was now practising a hard lesson in love: for it is a very hard one to love anybody that slaps us angrily in the face with a book, while the pain is still felt. Her generosity of spirit should have instantly done homage to his forbearance; but she was angry, and that is a great cover for every thing angered persons do, that is unjust to be wrapped up in! Caroline, however, seemed a little ashamed, but shame wouldn't heal her envy and jealousy. `Mrs. Linton, you are certainly a very strange wife!' at length said Lionel, in as mild a tone as he could assume. `And you are a very strange husband, Mr. Linton.' `What have I done?' `How innocent, all at once!' and she curled her lip. `I am innocent of wronging you, Caroline, in any way.' `How mild, sir, all at once. How I like to see a husband mild.' `What a vexatious person you are! You curl your lip with such bitterness and scorn that either you must be a very had woman or I a very bad man.' `There! you've just hit!' `Good Heaven! what has got into you? You make yourself the most disagreeable, hateful woman I ever saw.' `Yes, yes—I am not quite so charming, I know, as Ellen Lee.' `Confound Ellen Lee.' `Ha, ha, ha!' laughed Mrs. Linton, nervously rocking back in her chair. `You are determined to madden me—make me beside myself.' `Ellen will then restore you to your senses. I dare say you call and have a tete-a-tete with her every day you go out to walk.' `Never, Caroline!' `You have been seen twice walking in Broadway with her, and did not tell me of it.' `And who has been trying to make mischief? And what harm to walk with her? Each time I had met her with Harry, who turned her over to me, pleading engagements down town.' `Yes, oh yes!' she said with scornful incredulity, tossing her pretty head. `And you didn't go in and stay an hour, and no one else at home! Oh, ho.' `Upon my soul, I think you ean manage for so lovely a woman, to make yourself excessively disagreeable. Once for all, Mrs. Linton, are you jealous of my acquaintance with Harry's wife. If you are, I will speak to her no more from this hour.' `Jealous! Ha, ha! I jealous of you! No, no! If I was jealous, I have beauty enough to make you sick of flirting with other women!' `Do you mean that you will seek the attentions of men of gallantry?' he demanded with astonishment and pain. `I don't say what I mean or do not mean. I am not jealous! Jealous! Ha, ha, ha!' and she rocked away harder than before, and nearly bit through her fingers' ends to the blood. `Will you then be pleasant? You know I love you,' he said tenderly. `Not quite so well as Ellen Lee.' `If you mention that name again, I will run away from you,' said Lionel, impatiently. `You are jealous of me, envious of Ellen, and try to render yourself and me miserable, all without a shadow of cause. Caroline became pale at her husband's stern reproof, and it was plain a little firmness on his part would have subdued her quite. `Do you not dislike me because I have a foot longer than Ellen's, Mr. Linton?' she asked with something less of anger. `No.' `Do you not love Ellen for her pretty foot.' `No.' `I know you do now, and I know Ellen tries to contrast herself with me to my disadvantage? She always has her foot out on an ottoman or cricket! It is always to be seen.' `Because Harry's vanity makes her wear her dresses shorter than ordinary, and she—' `Oh, yes, she'll find a defender and champion in you, Lionel,' she said with inimitable scorn. `I think I had best hold my tongue,' he said pettishly. `I think you had,' she repeated with a bitter laugh. We think if he had altogether held his tongue, it wonld have been altogether best; for up to this point matters stood as they were when he came in to the chamber—if any thing, rather worse. At this instant Harry's voice was heard below stairs, and Lionel, whose natural goodness of the heart, and love for his wife would not let him retain revenge against her, hastily kissed her angry cheek, and kindly asking her if she wouldn't soon come down, left the chamber. Harry's short nap had restored him to a degree of sobriety, and he was ready to leave to go to his friend Sinclair's wine-proving. Ellen quickly perceived that something unpleasant had occurred between Lionel and Caroline, and she ordered her carriage, saying it would be too late for the baby to be out if she did not go then. Lionel saw her and Harry off, and then returned to the dining room, hoping Caroline would come down. But he saw her no more that night, for when he went to retire, she sent him word that the nurse was in her room with her for the night, and that he might go down and sleep on a sofa in his library, if he chose to. He sighed, and for the first time since his marriage, tried a bachelor's bed again in the small front room adjoining the parlor, which he had made a sort of library and smoking room having luxuriously furnished it with lounges, and pillows, and ottomans. Here he took up his quarters for the night! `Who wouldn't remain a bachelor if he knew what it was to be a married man?' sighed he, as he threw himself upon his solitary couch. `Yet, if Caroline wasn't jealous, I wouldn't change my state to what it was, for with all my trouble, I have enjoyed more real pure happiness the two years I have been married, than in all my bachelor iife! Well, he who would have the rose must have the thorn!' With this patient reflection, the bed-banished husband turned himself over and went to sleep. In the meanwhile, Harry and his wife had reached home, the carriage drove round to the stables, and taking leave of Ellen on the steps of his door, he was departing on his wine-engagement with his friend Sinclair, when she called him; `You will go by Lane's Harry—wait and take my gaiter-boots and leave them there. You can put them in your pocket, you know.' `Yes, in my vest pocket. What is to be done to them?' `The silk is split across the instep, and I want you to ask him if he can close it again neatly—if not to cover them with new fawn-colored silk.' `But get a new pair, Ellen.' `No—I have not worn these three times, and they are such a pretty shape.' `So they are! I will take them down Ellen, if you will give them to me' His wife after a moment's absence returned and placed in his hands a pair of the most exquisitely shaped French fawn-colored boots. Harry looked at them almost adoringly, and then examining the rent carefully, placed them in his coat pocket. `Now don't lose them out Harry,' she said, as he walked off in the direction of Broadway, with the toes of the little boots peeping out of his pocket. `Oh, no—I shall keep them safely, Ellen.' `Now come home early—and don't try too much of Captain Sinclair's `London Particular,' because you know, Harry—' `Yes, I know—I'll be prudent, you may depend upon me.' `Call in at Caroline's, when you come up, as you pass right by the house, and see if they have got over then little affair.' `Yes, perhaps I will. Adieu, my fair!'— Harry kissed his hand, and waived his lovely wife a gallant adieu. The evening at Captain Sinclair's passed off pleasantly, and about half past nine, Harry left most particularly mellow, to proceed home on foot—for he loved walking in preference to the omnibus-creeping dot-and-go-one pace. As he passed the head of Murray street, he recollected that he had forgotten to leave Ellen's boots in coming down, and immediately turned and went into Lane's fashionable ladies' shoe mart. `Ah, eh! Lane, good evening,' he said tipsily and pleasantly; `here's a pair of Mrs. Lee's gaiter boots—split out, you see—Ellen wants them sewed.' And Harry taking them from his pocket gave them to him. `Yes, I see, sir,' said Lane examining the rent and shaking his head; `but I fear it can't be done.' `It must be done—must, must be, be d-done Lane,' said Harry, keeping himself steady with his hand on the back of a chair. `It will cost quite as much as a new pair of boots, to repair it—the whole silk must be taken off—the welts made new—it will be quite as much work as to make a new boot, Mr. Lee. In fact, I would rather make a new pair.' `Develish bad, Lane! Ellen's favorite boots! Mine too! Small foot my wife has, eh, Lane?' `The prettiest boots I ever made, sir,' said Lane, admiring them. `I would know her shoe or boot if I saw it anywhere.' `So you would—so anybody would. Lane, you're a man of sentiment—of talk, I mean. But you can't mend 'em, eh?' `I am sorry to say no, sir.' `Well, I'll take them along with me, and try some other shoe store—perhaps some on 'em may find a way of fixing 'em.' `Perhaps so, Mr. Lee; but I advise you to have a new pair—they are quite useless to you.' `Are they, Lane?—then I'll take them and give 'em to some little poor child in the street. 'Tis a pity to lose 'em; such, such a p-pr-pret-ty fool!' and Harry recovering himself from a slight `vibration,' held up the boots to his own admiring eyes. He then put them in his pocket, and walked as erect as a granadier, from the shoe store—tipsy gentlemen always walk particularly erect, if they can! Notwithstanding Lane's judgment passed upon the boots, Harry took them into Whittington's and one or two other places, where he found condemnation passed upon them equally strong as at Lane's. He therefore became a little irritated, and was half of a mind to throw them into the street. While in this mood of temper, and yet holding them in his hand, he came opposite Linton's house. He remembered Ellen's request for him to call; but looking up at the house and seeing no lights, he concluded not to do so, and was about passing on, when he saw that the window of Lionel's library, where he was sleeping on the ottoman, was let down at the top, for the night was warm and close. Thereupon a thought struck him, and turning back a step, he tossed Ellen's hapless boots thro' into the room, and went on his way whistling, with an occasional hiccup for a second, `Wha'll be king but Charlie. oh, Wha'll be king but Charlie?' The ensuing morning, Mrs. Caroline Linton awoke, and lay reflecting upon all her conduct to Lionel. Her conscience convicted her of injustice towards him, and she resolved she would make him unhappy no longer by her jealousy. A night's sleep and the subsequent morning's reflections, often produce great changes in the minds both of men and women. Caroline felt she had been wrong, and herein her good sense had the ascendency. `I will go down to the library, and while he is asleep kiss him, wake him, and ask his forgiveness for my folly, and I will be jealous and envious no longer—for I know he loves me with all his noble and manly heart.' With this sensible and very praiseworthy resolution, she rose, threw on her snowy robe de chambre, and stole softly down stairs. All was still in the halls, and she timidly approached the door of the library. It was partly open, and she entered. Her husband lay asleep on the ottoman, in his dressing gown. She bent over him, and then lightly kissed his forehead! The touch, slight as it was, awakened him, and looking up he smiled upon hor with a calm joy that he could not give utterance to, and folded her to his heart. `You have slept badly here, I fear, Lionel,' she said, after a few moments' silence between them, during which he held her hand affectingly and happily in his. `Pretty well, wife—I have, however, been a long while unfamiliar with a bachelor's lodgings,' he said smiling. `Forgive me, Lionel! I have acted very foolishly. Won't you forgive me?' `With all my heart.' `If you will, I will never mention Ellen to you again.' `Nor doubt my love for you?' `No, never again, husband. I know you don't think of Ellen, except as my friend and as Harry's wife.' `You do me but justice, dear Caroline,' he said tenderly. `And I promise you I will never be jealous of you and Ellen a—' here she checked herself, uttered a shriek, and springing forward, caught up one of Ellen's boots which lay at the end of the sofa. Oh, what mischief Harry set on foot. `Good God! what is all this! cried Lionel, seizing his wife by the arm, not seeing the cause of her shrick. `What is it, Mr. Innocence? Look at this! whose boot is this, sir?' and she held up the hapless gaiter-boot to Lionel's astonished eyes. `It looks like Ellen's,' he said with surprise. `Looks like Ellen's! You know it is her's; and now tell me how it came here?' `Upon my soul, I am ignorant as the babe unborn.' `You do know. A lady's boot in your sleeping-room and you innocent of all knowledge of it!' `It may have been thrown into the library door, yesterday, by her nurse. If there were a pair of them found, your suspicions might have some foundation!' pleaded Lionel in the most unlucky sentence a man ever uttered. `Then,' she shrieked, her searching and jealous eyes having discovered the toe of the other peeping from beneath the sofa, `then you have condemned yourself out of your own mouth, Sir! Look at this, too!' and she held up the mate to the eye of the astounded husband. Lionel gazed upon it as if it had been a basalisk. `Well, Sir,' demanded the infuriated wife, her eyes flashing, her cheek pale, and her whole form heaving with anger, wounded pride, and violent jealousy. `By mine honor, Caroline, I know nothing about it.' `You do—you do, Mr. Linton! Where is she—where is the wicked thing concealed?' And Mrs. Linton flew to the window curtains, and examined their folds—lifted the drapery before a book case, got down on the floor and looked under the sofas and ottomans —peeped behind the door, and then taking breath, came and thrust the fatal boots once more in poor Lionel's face.' `Oh, you villain!' she cried nervously, and with terrific emotion shaking her whole frame, `you will be the death of me! You will, you will!' and overcome by the intensity and excess of her feelings, she shrieked, and fell fainting into the arms of her grieved, wondering, alarmed and puzzled husband. `Mrs. Linton was conveyed to her chamber, a servant despatched for a physician, and another for Harry and his wife. These parties all arrived about the same time, and Lionel taking Harry aside, privately communicated the whole matter to him. He was listened to very gravely by his friend, who, when he had concluded, gave himself freely up to the merriest fit of laughter, he had ever indulged in. When, at length, Lionel could make him speak, he explained to him how the boots came in his room. `Come, for heaven's sake, to Caroline's room with me,' cried Lionel, dragging him by the arms; `she is calmer now. You have almost been my ruin; you snall now save me.' Harry went into the chamber where Caroline lay, with her arm bound up, for she had just been bled for a determination of blood to the brain. She had fiercely forbidden Ellen to come near her, and when Lionel entered, she shrieked, and called him her murderer. Harry, however, succeeded in calming her sufficiently to listen to him, when he explained in his humorous and happy way, the adventure of the boots. Caroline listened at first with incredulity; but as Harry concluded, she felt convinced of the truth of his account, especially when she called to mind that he had as much cause for jealousy about the introduction of the boots into Lionel's sleeping room, as herself. After a few moment's reflection, with her hands covering her face, she looked up with a sweet smile and silently extended one hand to Lionel, the other to Ellen—the one pressed her to his grateful heart, the other affectionately kissed her cheek, and a full and perfect reconcilliation was ratified and sealed. `I will never be jealous again, Lionel, be circumstances ever so strong against you; I feel I have been very silly, and made you and Ellen very unhappy. I hope you will both forgive me.' `And am I to be forgiven?' asked Harry, taking her hand, `for making so much mischief?' `Freely, since you have so well repaired the mischief you have done,' she said gaily; `but I hope you will be careful never to throw a lady's boots, particularly your wife's, into a gentleman's window again!' It will be well to mention that the visit to the statue of Diana at Launitz's studio, was made, and that the result was most happy on the mind of the beautiful and Diana-like Mrs. Linton; who, from that moment, was no more jealous of Ellen's small foot, being perfectly satisfied that a lady may wear number three's and yet have as beautiful and symmetrical feet as one who wears number one French gaiter boots.</field>
