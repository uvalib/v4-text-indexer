      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. 'Tis far off; And rather like a dream, than an assurance That my remembrance warrants: Had I not Four or five women once that tended me? Tempest. I WAS but a young thing, not yet “Standing with reluctant feet Where the brook and river meet, Womanhood and childhood fleet”— when there came a change in our outward circumstances. During my first years, we had enjoyed what some of our ancestors had toiled for; and my father after each day's soaring and diving into philosophy and science walked about our garden in silk stockings and with a rose in his mouth,— at that time I was a little thing that the rose-bushes looked down upon. And I looked up to them, with admiring eyes that often went higher still, and took in the straw hat that Mr. Howard wore of an afternoon: certainly that hat was a miracle for all purposes of shade and adornment. Our winters were spent in town, and in the long evenings I, perched on a chair by my father, studied with him the last engravings which he had sent home,—wondering at the strange German and French names which he pronounced so easily, and sometimes hiding them with my hand, to test his skill or recollection. Pleasant little unbound packages!— pleasant to me still is the thought of their brown and yellow covers as they lay piled on the pier-table, whither my feet made frequent journeys, as bundle after bundle was exhausted. And Kate would look up from her studies and say, “Another one already!—why how fast you get on to-night.” And I would reply, “O it's only St. Bruno—and we didn't want to see him.” Then at other times there was talk,—often above my comprehension, and where I could only amuse myself with the different looks and tones of the speakers; with Kate's earnestness and my father's coolness, and with Mrs. Howard's smile at them both and at my listening face. If my father caught sight of this last, he would often end the lesson he was giving with some laughing remark to me. “It is well you are a little younger than Kate, Gracie, or I should do nothing but answer questions.” And to reward my close attention he would give us a long account of some one of his favourite shells,—where it was found, and how it was obtained, and what its former inhabitant lived on,—or now and then a mineral was the text; but there I soon lost footing again, between the crust of the earth and its different strata. And yet though my thoughts could grasp but very little of such subjects, they seldom came down without some token of where they had been—a kind of stepping-stone for the next effort. “To labour, and to be content with what a man hath, is a sweet life,” says some wise proverb: of the first clause we had then no experience, but for a time we did prove the second, and the conclusion. Then came the years of speculation, when money seemed as inexhaustible as the gold of California, and far more easily come by. No labour nor content now,—the bargain of yesterday sold for five thousand dollars advance to-day; with almost as little ceremony as in the Irishman's “Done and done, is enough between two jantlemen.” I thought and cared little about the matter—even the tangible part of it; though I certainly found it pleasant to ride to Levy's, and see muslins and silks bought for me; and also to pay as many visits as I liked to the candy shops,—but I had never felt the want of money, and knew not its value— even so much as a child may know. It seems strange to me now, to think of accounts at the Bank,—of the time when cheques cost but a scratch of my father's pen.—As I have said, there came a change. It came, and was at work some time before it reached my understanding; and the tokens of its progress puzzled and sometimes disturbed me—giving a sort of check like a handful of earth thrown on a young plant's head. But the impulse of life and spirits was too strong—and after a few minutes the shoot would push its way through the encumbering soil, and shake off the last particle from its un-tear-wet leaves. “Mamma,” I said on one of these occasions, “that man must have sent home the wrong handkerchiefs—these aren't near so fine as my last set.” “I know they are not, Gracie,” she answered. The words struck me with a sort of surprise. That my stepmother should have done a thing of intent, was as much as to say, that thing was best to do; and an undefined half realization of the truth, took away all desire of further information,—I asked not another word. And Mrs. Howard quietly left the lesson to Time's teaching. That was in the beginning of our descent—I had yet to get used to it. Now, on looking back, I feel as if we had come like a child slipping down hill,—afraid to let ourselves go, and catching at every bush to stop our progress; but that if we had come straight to the bottom, it would have hurt us less than we imagined, and we should the sooner have got breath to go up again. For even in temporal things, the valley of humiliation is far more pleasant than the side-hill which leads to it. Yet I do not mean to regret what is passed,—the shock has perhaps been less—the wholesome discipline and experience, greater. Let me go back for a moment to the time when our feet began to lose ground, softly, softly,—when we laid hold of a great tree that we thought would sustain us—finding too late that its top spread further than its roots; ere I tell how that tree loosened and loosened, and finally brought us to the foot of the hill.—It did not fall on top of us—that was one comfort,—neither strength nor hope was quite destroyed. “And indeed,” says Bunyan of the valley, “it is a fruitful soil, and doth bring forth by handfuls.”— Gently the wind swept over the snow-covered streets; gently the firelight brightened and faded, brightened and faded, on the ceiling of the last parlour where we sat as rich people; while my father was conning one of a half dozen evening papers, and pencils and books occupied other heads and hands that were about the table. Suddenly broke forth the following advertisement. “For sale—A large property on the banks of Lake Luna, —consisting of meadow, farm, and woodland—splendid sites for country-seats, unrivalled water-power, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. The scenery and salubrity of this celebrated place cannot be surpassed. Roads of the greatest variety and excellence afford opportunity for driving and equestrian exercise; while pedestrians will find a never-failing source of delight in the romantic strolls about the neighbourhood. “Fish and game abound in every direction; and the near vicinity of the Honiton turnpike (one of the finest in the country) renders it easy for gentlemen who are so disposed, to attend to their business in other places. “The neighbourhood is eminently moral. “A celebrated physician has been induced, rather from regard to the mental than bodily wants of his friends, to locate in their midst; and although there is as yet but one church within ten miles, other denominations will no doubt find it for their advantage to share so interesting a region. “It is also in contemplation to erect a college in Ethan township. “The present proprietor being obliged to go to Europe, is desirous of curtailing his business and responsibilities in this country; and would dispose of the above grounds on terms that could not fail to render them a profitable purchase. “Apply to R. H. McLoon.—Wall-st., New York.” “Why that is the very place!” said my father. “What place?” “Why the place that brother Ned is so anxious to have 1* me buy—that he says could be made so productive. He has been writing of nothing else for the last two months.” “And why should you buy it?” pursued Mrs. Howard, with a woman's desire to know the what for—even of a speculation. “Why?—O Ned says the purchase money could be doubled in no time,—and I dare say he is right. I presume it would make my fortune.” Mrs. Howard smiled—one of those smiles that are half a sigh—and her eye glanced round the room. A superb coal fire and an equally superb Carcelle lamp, shone upon Turkey carpets, damask curtains and sofas, chandeliers, carved furniture, pictures, shells and statues; while between the windows a second fire and lamp seemed to gleam and blaze in the long mirror, and called forth a reflection even from the far end of the next room. “Make my fortune!”— “Well?” said my father as the quiet eye came back from its survey. “Well?—what now?” “I was thinking,” replied my stepmother, “of what somebody said to Alexander.” “Fiddle-de-dee!” said my father, “but at that rate nobody would ever speculate.” Another slight smile, a half sorrowful shake of the head, answered this remark, and my father seemed a little posed. “To be sure”—he said thoughtfully, “the place is larger than I like—some thousand acres I believe,—and would need a good deal of attention and outlay. Well, we shall see,— I will talk to Ned about it; but I always thought you would like a country-seat again.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. From thence the tide of fortune left the shore, And ebb'd much faster than it flow'd before. Dryden. THE man who getting frightened when half across a river, turned about and swam back, has been more laughed at than he deserved; for there is always at least a question of shores, and the remnant of that strength which will suffice to reach either, may be much the most available on one. It is possible to rest and recruit, where enterprise would be madness. Had we followed this renowned example, and turned our backs upon Fortune when she took leave of us, we should have been—I don't know what—it is impossible now to say; but we should not have been the possessors of Glen Luna. Like wise people we pushed on, and entered “the diggings” with neither the proper utensils nor the means and skill to procure and use them. One precautionary measure we did take—we sold our town house,—as soldiers burn the ships which have brought them where they are to conquer or die. It was not quite for the same reason; but the times were changed now, in earnest, and as we could not keep all, of course we chose the new. How far this desired possession had made it needful to part with most things else, perhaps no one guessed but Mrs. Howard; nor do I now know. One thing was certain,—we were to leave Philadelphia, and because we must. Various were the opinions of people about us and our private arrangements,—and my father's regard to them was as steadily cool and careless. In the first place he merely meant to go for the summer; and had that not been so, with the glowing visions he had in prospect Mr. Howard would nave said, “No shame to stoupe one's head, more highe to reare; And much to gain, a litel for to yield.” Shame!—that found no place in my father's mind, with such a police as his own honour and self-respect; and if he had been to try his hand at daily labour instead of a new speculation, he would have walked as erect, and look people in the face as unshrinkingly. He had no fear of losing himself, anywhere. Mrs. Willet declared his conduct was “noble! noble!”— a speech I could make nothing of, for I understood but partially the reasons of that conduct. It seemed a small piece of self-denial to give up one house for another; and as my imagination had already supplied Glen Luna with chickens, cats, and flowers—three tribes that flourish but ill in a city —I thought we were like to gain as many pleasures as we should lose. But sense and appreciation were quickened as the last weeks came, and I knew them to be the last, and felt them going! Stephanie Holbrook—a somewhat quicksilver ward of my father's—was to spend our moving-time with her aunt, Mrs. Eustace; and as Kate had not been well, it was agreed that she should go too and escape the confusion. While they remained, nothing was stirred nor taken leave of. Yes— there was one exception,—Kate and I had a farewell drive, and stood watching the quick feet of our receding ponies as they trotted round the corner, with a feeling of sadness that would perhaps have been deeper, had we known how many a long day would pass before their successors appeared at Glen Luna. But at all events these were old friends; and we had seen them toss their heads and kick their feet over the traces, till we felt well acquainted. Perhaps too, the young hearts felt what the young reason could not quite follow out and define,—some shadowy if: as though other of our comforts were beginning to trot off in a cloud of dust. Certainly we both entered the house feeling very sober; and I began to cling more closely to all we were to part with. “It is good that we can keep our saddle-horses,” Kate said with a half sigh,—“I should be sorry to think we should never mount Puck and Mopsa again. But papa says he shall make us ride a great deal, Gracie.” I assented, with that qualifying breath of which I was learning the use, but the house did not regain its old look. Neither was there any other look to brighten it. There was altogether too much resolution about my father—he could not have come down to common intercourse, if he had had time. Mrs. Howard was too busy, and too anxious; and Kate's untutored foot tried too hard to keep step with my father's. Stephanie chose her own way of expressing her thoughts. “Do you suppose, Kate,” she would say, “that we shall have any occasion for kid gloves in the backwoods? Or what do you think of our speculating a little—selling all our laces and buying linen collars? a great many more than we want, but still very useful. I don't know whether Mechlin and Valenciennes will be quite becoming in farmer's daughters.” A very decided refusal of this last title was expressed by Kate without words. “You may be as scornful as you please, my dear—it's true. I don't know what the women wear, but you'll not see a coat in that region that isn't made of baize, nor a pair of pantaloons of anything but velveteen.” “I shall not see many of them,” was Kate's cool rejoinder. Other people however, took up the same notion; and we were favoured with more than one speech of warning and condolence; but they went for little, because, as we said, no one had any right to make them. Meanwhile the season stood not still, and by the time spring was half gone Mrs. Eustace came for her visiters. That was the breaking-up day—after it the sooner we went the better. It did not look like breaking up,—the April sun shone very fairly, and all the imprisoned birds in the street sang their gratitude for the imaginary freedom they enjoyed outside the brick walls; or rather that the wires which kept them in were passable to sunbeams. So were not the dark lines which had ranged themselves around me,—I had treasured up all my regrets for that day, and there was not one of them wanting. From that chief one—the parting with Kate —the rest seemed to stretch away in perspective. I said goodbye to Stephanie and saw her get into the carriage, unmoved; but when Kate ready dressed for her journey came down stairs, and pausing in the hall took one look at the drawing-room—one last survey of the things we had loved and the place where we had been so happy—I felt a degree of sorrow that surprises me even now; and when she slowly turned away and passed out of the front door, I felt that we had quitted our home,—the after dismantling would be a less matter,—the crisis was passed. And yet it was a trial to see our beautiful rooms, where taste and fancy and wealth had been so effective, stripped of all their adornments,—to have the associations which like sprites lurked in the folds of the window curtains, perched on the chandeliers, and peeped at us from statues and vases, scattered and driven away into the cold world of strangers. Poor little sprites!—they come round me now, once in a while. Even the things we were to take with us seemed to share the general air of confiscation,—it was hard to realize that we were to see them again, or to believe that they could look the same when taken out of their rough boxes and set down in a new place. Then the furniture to be sold must be examined and displayed; and this latter duty fell upon me. How did I feel the lines of my face change, as with a childish feeling of dignity and grave as was ever bearded senator, I obeyed my father's summons to the drawing-room, and went through all the mysteries of drawers and cushions and strings and locks,—of which Mr. Howard knew about as much as most men. These strangers were not of those who “walk as friends,” —they had bought our house and now wished to buy some of its contents,—it never seemed to occur to them that it was not quite the same thing as going to a cabinet-maker's. They thought but of their own interest—not of my sorrow; nor ever dreamed that the child who knelt by the sofa and busied herself in untying the strings of its chintz cover, had eyes and fingers half unfitted for the task. There was no look towards me, no softening or hushing of their comments; no gentle word or smile. Perhaps it was well,—I could hardly have borne them. And so I went quietly through my task, while Mr. Howard walked up and down with an air of the most frigid abstraction, and the future occupants talked and canvassed and measured,—this they would take because it would fit, and that they would not take because it was old-fashioned. The pier-glasses happened to meet their approbation; and I think sometimes of those quiet mirrors hanging there still— clear, bright as ever; while the little figure that danced before them is so changed—so altered! Oh how the new-comers plagued us during those succeeding days of confusion! Not content with sending their furniture, they would come themselves,—walk through the house, open the room-doors and look in, until even the quiet Mrs. Howard threatened desperate measures. And when I, sometimes sick and often tired and sad, was sent upstairs out of the way of cold and dust; and sat there all alone, wearying myself for my sister; the first thing would be the intrusion of a bonnet and one of those chilling strange faces. I really thought they might have taken it out in looking at the furniture below. But whatever else the Barons were, they were no practisers of kind politeness; and the head of the family drove our cook to the last stage of indignant ridicule, by walking into the kitchen and requesting to see the pot-closet! “She hadn't an idea that Mr. Howard had ever heard of such a thing—no more a gentleman ought! What had he to do with kittles but to eat what come out of 'em?—and as to wanting to know where they was kep”— words failed, and she could do nothing but laugh. “Prosperity gains friends, and adversity tries them.”— The day our first carpet was taken up, a neighbour whom we knew very slightly sent a most cordial note of request that we would all come and stay with her till we were ready to leave town. It could not be done, but the kindness was not forgotten—is not to this day. Meantime nothing was heard from Mrs. Osborne round the corner, nor Mrs. Willet over the way,—both old friends. My stepmother found that she had no time for farewell visits; but the day before we were to go, she sent me to say goodbye to a few whom age or long acquaintanceship marked out for such an attention. With what a strange mood I went my little round, feeling neither very well nor very bright; exchanging silent greetings with the pavements and familiar corners, and now and then finding my grave little self in a circle of well-known faces and loudly-spoken adieus —I suppose they were meant for that; though they had a kind of abstraction, a savour of curiosity or wonder or carelessness, that kept them very far from my heart. At the end of the round I came to Mrs. Willet's large stone house; and after ringing the bell I stood looking up at its grey front —becurtained to the very attic—wondering curiously with myself when I should stand on those steps again. I was received in full divan,—for the three Miss Willets who would have been girls in any other house, were young ladies in this, with all the rights of curls and braids and flounces; and this morning their toilet had even preceded their mother's. “When do you leave town?” inquired Mrs. Willet. “To-morrow afternoon, ma'am.” “Well Grace my dear, can't you all come and sleep here to-night? we've plenty of room you know. Wouldn't it be a convenience? I might have had you before, and to dinner and breakfast, but I didn't think of it. Won't Mrs. Howard come?” “I don't think she can, Mrs. Willet.” “Come, I'll go and ask her myself.”— And cutting my audience short, the lady ventured her turbaned head into the street; but when she had half crossed the space which divided the two houses, another lady went up our steps. “Who is that?” said my companion stopping short. “Mrs. Baron.” “O bless me, I can't go—I'm not dressed—I know her;” and back ran Mrs. Willet, nor did we see or hear from her again. I have sometimes thought, that not till we are in trouble can we understand the force of that expression, “the salt of the earth.” How might one look, one word, season as it were whole scores that are flat and heartless. I did not follow out any such idea, nor indeed get hold of it; but the want was upon me as I reached the dusty and littered sidewalk, and saw my father overseeing the loading of a cart, and then found my way to Mrs. Howard and declared myself tired. I had been under a cloud;—but now that the house was cleared the sky seemed brighter. Child-like, I turned my thoughts forward; and when the last hour came, and we drove away leaving our old servants grouped together on the sidewalk, I was much less sad than I had been before the moving began.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. O my ain fireside! my ain fireside!— There's nought like a blink o' one's ain fireside! Old Song. MR. NED HOWARD lived in a village which was the vis-à-vis of our new home, and which was known in those regions as “the Moon,”—whether because the two horns of the lake half enclosed it, or because some early settler had been learned enough to translate the name of our watery crescent, I know not; but the Moon it was called, and in the Moon lived Mr. Ned Howard. Or I should rather say near it—in the village-ship, if one may coin a word—and somewhat looked up to by his neighbours for being rich enough to do nothing. Thither we came one rainy night in April, weary with the long journey and with the unsettled state of our affairs and spirits; and there we took up our abode until both should be somewhat set in order. No wet travellers ever received a more stirring welcome. Mrs. Ned put herself in a bustle, her mother asked all manner of questions; and bustle and questions went sweetly down when we caught a glance of my uncle's bright eye, and saw the glad expression of his face. We had the one word and look then. Mrs. Ned Howard was a very different person from her husband. She had the misfortune to be come of what she thought a good family, and was not sufficiently ballasted with sense and fine etceteras to bear her honours meekly. So her silk dress always rustled, and her hands wore brown gloves to breakfast and white gloves to dinner; and from the exceeding erectness of her head you might have supposed that there was an imaginary crown upon it, which she was afraid would tumble off. Neither was the lady forgotten in the minor affairs of life. Rear meat bordered upon hysterics—a large piece of bread upon disgust; and as to beginning dinner without at least a purée à-la-crême—Mrs. Ned would have thought it the extreme of barbarism. The currants came on table with all their natural addenda of stems, leaves, and cobwebs—but free from the pollution of any hands save the gardener's,— Mrs. Ned's own fingers dipped every cherry that she eat in a glass of water. Indian corn was a puzzler;—but with her own peculiar notions about “the least of two evils,” Mrs. Ned promptly summoned a servant to cut the grains from the cob, that the delicacy might be within reach of her fork. Unhappily, she had never learned to act out the common but expressive maxim, “Put the best foot foremost.”—Yet there could be a most kind smile in her eye, a most friendly tone in her voice; but in her education the good had not been developed, nor the evil kept down. Mrs. McNamara had all her daughter's temper and pride, without the redeeming qualities. Her eye was cold, inquisitive, or sinister, by turns. No needless toilet labour here; —if the grey woollen wrapper with which Mrs. McNamara covered her head in cold weather could have been exchanged for something more tidy—even for another of its own species —it would have been a public benefit. And in her combination there was an ingredient far more disagreeable than Mrs. Ned's anomaly of sharp bluntness,—the faint shadow of a second face under the hood, makes the first a thing to look away from. Perhaps the object on earth to which she had most regard, was her youngest son, Victor McNamara; but of him I need only say that inheritance and education had unhappily combined their forces. “And how does the house look, Ned?” said my father. “Well, very well, but you are wanted sadly. I'm sure Morrison lets his men stand idle one half the time.” “I doubt whether they stand idle,” said my father. “Pho—well what you please. They haven't near done blasting those rocks.” “Blasting!” said my stepmother. “But I thought the house was almost finished,—are they at the foundations yet?” “No, no, my dear—not at all,—this has nothing to do with the house. I am only taking off the top of a height that came in the way of a certain view I want.” “But will the view be as pretty as the height?” “Of course—if it isn't we can put the rocks back again.” “It will be a great comfort to your husband to have you here to advise him,” said Mrs. McNamara in a soft way that at once gave one a caution. “Gentlemen know so little how to get on alone.” It is fortunate that nothing can be discovered where there is nothing to conceal. My stepmother's quiet “Do you think so?” made Mrs. McNamara settle her wrapper and change her ground. “What did you do with all your furniture?” “All that we did not sell we brought with us.” “I suppose you didn't save any of your parlour furniture? Dear, dear, what a pity!” “It was no very great pity to part with what we could not use here,” said my stepmother smiling,—“and some of it we kept.” “Not mirrors or anything of that sort?” “Of course not!” put in Mrs. Ned. “Do you think they have no sense?” “Why my dear I didn't know.” “I think if you will excuse us,” said my stepmother, “Grace and I will go to bed,—we are both tired. I suppose we have the same room as last summer?” “No,” said Mrs. Ned,—“the front room on the second floor.” “But that is your room—I would much prefer the other.” “No,” said Mrs. Ned again,—“it makes no difference to me, and that one has been arranged for you.” My stepmother hesitated a moment, and then saying goodnight, she preceded me upstairs. “It seems we are giving a great deal of trouble,” she said when our door was shut,—“this will hurry our house-cleaning.” “It wasn't very goodnatured of aunt Harriet to put us in this room,” I remarked; but Mrs. Howard made no reply, and I went to bed and dreamed of our umquhile ponies. There was a bright sun shining when I opened my eyes next day; and as I looked at the various objects in our room —the dark carved bedstead, the glass jars of West India snakes, (I don't think I always felt sure of their prison-walls) —the blue sofa, the lamp,—there came a thought of something else that I had wanted to do or see—what was it? My mind roved about for a minute, and then I had sprung out of bed and was peeping through the window curtains to get a distant first view of our new home. There it lay on the other side of the lake, the fresh boards showing bare and unhomelike in the sun; and the quiet Sunday morning investing everything with a character that even the eye could perceive. It looked pleasant, it looked peaceful;—and though its appearance suggested neither chandeliers nor long mirrors, I turned away with only one feeling of dissatisfaction,—I could not have a nearer view till next day. Meanwhile the hours were sufficiently uneventful. Mrs. Howard was in bed all the morning with a headache; and except that when I was ready for church Mrs. McNamara inquired, “if that was my last winter's bonnet,” my presence excited little attention. Happily, I needed it not,—my mind was full of its own fresh pleasures,—the fountain asked no supply from anybody's hand. I had never been in that region before, though my uncle had lived there three or four years; but since he left Philadelphia none of us had tried Mrs. Ned's hospitality but my father and mother, and the latter only once. So everything was quite new to me—I had not even made its acquaintance at second-hand; and first impressions came in a delightful stream. There never was such a walk to church—there never was such another church at the end of a walk,—and there I was not far wrong. It stood at the western extremity of the lake, the beautifully kept groundwork of turf running quite down to the still water, the boundaries set back among the trees so as to be invisible. No pillar reared its Corinthian capital there,—the rough hewn stone, the unpretending, substantial architecture, gave to the little church an air of truth and frankness that was very pleasing; and echoes caught each stroke of the bell, and gave them back with faint and fainter music. I came home in a sort of ecstasy, and assured my stepmother as she sat in the easy-chair by the fire, that it was “the very loveliest place anybody had ever lived in.” “And it cannot be so very lonely, mamma,” I added, “for even on the side where our house is I saw smoke coming out of the woods in several places. Now mamma, you need not smile—don't you remember how Mrs. Osborne talked about there being nobody here?” “I shall have no fears for your happiness Gracie, when we are once settled.” “O I should be very happy to-day—if it was only to-morrow.” I thought myself so as it was, when afternoon brought me another walk; and in the few minutes before and after service I tried to see something of the congregation, and to decide over which of the assembled heads that smoke was in the habit of curling; but most probably I chose the wrong ones. Monday morning brought a disappointment. “You will not think of going to Glen Luna yourself?” said Mrs. Ned as she drew on the brown gloves after breakfast. “Certainly,” replied my stepmother,—“I am going at once. But I think I shall not take Grace—the weather looks threatening.” “I did not suppose you dreamed of taking her,” said Mrs. Ned,—“such a child is only in one's way and in danger of getting sick. I think you are very unwise to go yourself.” “Dear me! to be sure!” said Mrs. McNamara with a voice that made me wonder what concern of hers it could possibly be. “Indeed I am never in mamma's way,” I interposed. But a few drops of rain settled the question, and sorrowfully enough I watched Mr. and Mrs. Howard drive away. O the weariness of being left alone! especially where one does not want to be. It did not rain after all, and Mrs. Ned and Mrs. McNamara went out for their usual daily walk in the garden. Perhaps they feared I might follow them, for at the foot of the steps Mrs. Ned paused, and called out, “Victor! take Grace and show her the beauties of the orchard.” Nobody wanted me.—Victor, who had grown to that uncomfortable age which is neither one thing nor the other, escorted me a little way into the orchard, showed me two dead pigs which lay in the road, and then went off to his own pursuits. And I, knowing better than to go after the ladies, re-entered the house, and sent longing glances to those new clap-boards which seemed the pleasantest thing in sight. Now among the peculiarities of Mrs. Ned and her mother was an insane desire to keep cool—not within but without,— it was their idiosyncrasy. At that chill time of year when a fire is wanted almost as much as in winter, there was none to be seen; unless possibly three sticks at night and two in the morning. Also the windows were opened immediately after breakfast, and not shut again until—I hardly know when. The rules of the house were a very slight lunch and a very late dinner. I went upstairs with no inward or outward defence against the cold, and between that and hunger was fairly driven into dreamland, and slept a good part of the morning. It would be hard to describe my satisfaction one evening, when the weather being cooler than usual or Mrs. Ned more sensitive, she really wanted a fire—and a fire could not be had. There was no wood sawn, and the saw was broken, and nobody to mend it; and the way she shivered and warmed her hands over the chafingdish comforted me for a week's freezing. Three days did Mrs. Howard go and come without me— ravishing my ears every night with accounts of chickens and garden;—on the fourth I was again left behind, but with a promise that I should follow her at midday with Mr. Ned. With what joy did I set out! with what concentrated senses did I take note of everything! how little justice I gave the speed of my uncle's good horses. It was a long drive, for beyond the church the road swept back from the lake, and made quite a circuit before it approached Glen Luna. I wished myself on foot that I might take one of the tantalizing little paths which promised a shorter route; but as my uncle said, it would be all the same when we had once got there,—and it was. The house itself was not only upside down with carpenters and masons, plasterers and painters, but literally “turned out of the windows;” for boxes of furniture were standing about the lawn in all directions. A child's magnifying-glass has no lens for troubles. What did I care for the blasting in one direction, the scraper and oxen in another; the boards, the nails, the utter and hopeless confusion everywhere?—they were all hidden, at least from my mind's eye, by a brood of little soft downy chickens that called a barrel their home, and a most benign-looking old hen their mother. So I watched them, brought chips to the little kitchen which looked like one of our town pantries, examined my new garden tools, clambered up and jumped down the front door step—it was then full three feet from the ground,—and finally went upstairs and seated myself in the midst of baskets and jars and bundles, to lunch. I had been offered something to eat before I left the Moon, but preferred to reserve my appetite for home stores; and with a good will I now brought it to bear upon bread and butter and raspberry jam. Luncheon over, Mr. Ned proposed that I should go home with him, but my mind was made up to the contrary. So he departed alone, Mrs. Howard returned to her labours and I to mine; and surely I wore rose-coloured spectacles that day, if ever child did. Indeed I careered about rather too much for Mrs. Howard's comfort, for while I was quietly digging up flowers at the edge of the woods, or walking round some rock or knoll to see what was on the other side, she would get quite frightened about me. Towards evening my uncle sent a boat for us, as being the quickest and least fatiguing way of getting back; and after a last feeding of chickens and locking of doors, we set out to cross the lake. It was near dark but very quiet, and the dip of the oars was as good as a lullaby. Gently my spirits subsided, and I came back to the every-day world. “How very good dinner will taste!” said I. “Yes,” said Mrs. Howard, “I begin to feel quite hungry.” “You had better curb both appetite and expectation,” said my father,—“it is long past dinner-time.” “But papa! they must have saved us some, for they knew we should be very hungry.” “Hum”—said Mr. Howard as the boat struck the shore, —“well—must is a strong word no doubt, but you are welcome to my share of the dinner, Gracie.” My stepmother and I went directly upstairs, and having made ourselves presentable we descended to the parlour with our hopes somewhat cooled by my father's remarks. He had reason. The tea-table was set with wafers of bread and butter and fractions of toast, but dinner might have been an obsolete meal for all that appeared to the contrary. We took our seats without a word. “Harriet,” said my uncle taking a survey of the plates before him, “didn't you save some dinner for these people?” “Certainly not Mr. Howard—I thought they knew our dinner-hour.” “But when people are cleaning house they can't be tied down to a minute.” “I could not possibly tell when they would come,” replied Mrs. Ned, her face flushing and the imaginary crown in unusual danger;—“and as to waiting dinner it would have been absurd—I did not know but they would choose to dine on the other side.” “Choose to dine on chips and mortar!” said my uncle with a mixture of laugh and vexation. “Is there nothing left from dinner?” “I really cannot tell, Mr. Howard,” said Mrs. Ned getting up and ringing the bell with great energy,—“how should I know what was left from dinner? Charles,” she added as the waiter came in, “just go down stairs and bring up any cold meat and vegetables that you can find.” “And tell Violet to warm them first,” said my uncle. There was a moment's pause, and then my stepmother entered her protest,—in vain. “Certainly we could have dinner,” Mrs. Ned replied—“if there was any,”—so we half waited and half went on eating, till the arrival of some boiled fish re-warmed, brown uncomfortable-looking potatoes, and beets. By this time Mrs. Ned recollected herself and did the honours of the Cod as well as might be; but we had eaten so many of the decimal fractions, and had heard so much 2 conversation, that the reinforcement was little heeded except by my father,—who eat his dinner very unconcernedly. Three weeks passed thus. Every day we went to the Glen, but having been taught our lesson we took care always to return by dinner-time. Every day I made some new discovery,—a strange wild-flower—a nice chicken-coop in place of the barrel—a moss pincushion of peculiar luxuriance, or a rock that had some extraordinary advantages as a table or a lookout. But Mrs. Howard grew very tired of the punctual-dinner system, and found it most inconvenient to be so far from the scene of action; and at last she resolved to take possession of our house before it was quite ready for us, and let Mrs. Ned have her own room again. So we removed. It was near the gloaminst, when we took our first meal at Glen Luna,—we three. The two older ones thinking gravely of ways and means, prospects and probabilities,—the younger with “eyes brimful of delight,” and a mood that thought herrings and bread and butter the very best things that ever were eaten. And a whip-poor-will who knew not of our coming, sat on a tree close by the house, and sang—as he thought, to himself—but to us it seemed a strange, wild welcome. We could not translate his plaintive notes, yet not one of the listeners but felt an echo of that trill,—as wild, as untranslatable. And we were fairly established in our new home;—and one of the number at least, had very bright hopes and forebodings—an undefined expectation of everything pleasant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. Our youth! our childhood! that spring of springs! Tis surely one of the blessedest things That nature ever invented! When the rich are wealthy beyond their wealth, And the poor are rich in spirits and health, And all with their lots contented! Hood. WE were awaked next morning by a perfect concert of cat birds and song sparrows,—waked to see the sun rise on our new habitation, and our untried country life. Who does not remember some first awaking in a strange place?—the quiet lying still as the eye takes in unwonted walls and windows that are bright with the old familiar sunlight,—the gradual gathering up of the stray ends of remembrance—the where, the how, and the whence,—and then the sudden spring of both mind and body at the thought of the new and unproved things that await one below stairs. I remember it all, though now what my waking eyes first rest upon has been so often seen in every variety of early light, that I can hardly realize its having ever looked strange to me;—as hardly as that the cat birds which have sung at my matinées this summer, were then unheard of in the musical world: or by some remote possibility of long life, were on that very morning hiding their undeveloped feathers and faculties together, beneath a blue egg-shell. So have we both emerged!—they from the nest, I from the child's mist which was pervious to nothing but sunshine. Uncle Ned was at the door by the time we had breakfasted; and after some words of greeting and advice, and a long message from Mrs. Ned and Mrs. McNamara about our health and happiness, he and I set forth on a walk. All new to me,—all glittering with fresh dew-drops! My uncle was in his element, and talked almost as fast as I did. Now he led the way through a little thicket of young trees, charging me to tell my father that there was the place to transplant from; now he pointed out some fair little flower and told of his success or failure when he had tried to inure it to his garden. It was in that walk I first saw the moccasin flower, or rather its bud, for they were not near their full size and had scarce begun to show colour. But we dug them up—vain experiment! and Mr. Ned told of yellow ones that he had found; and then I hoped that every green bud a little paler than usual belonged to the yellow species. We found too the fair pink azalea,—the shadblossom—with more literal but less spiritual fairness;— and mosses and ferns, and little nameless white flowers that to this day I know only by sight. There is nothing left of that walk but the remembrance. The child and the man have both passed away:—the slight flower has raised up its head and shaken out its full petals, —the stronger plant has withered and been cut down. We came back in a great heat, for the sun had got the vantage-ground and was pouring down his beams with as perfect unconcern as if we had been pine-apples. Mr. Ned threw himself on the ground in the shade, while I went off to dispose of my spoils. Presently I heard, “Grace, Grace! here's a new flower for you!” I ran, but all I could see at first was my uncle, still on the grass and laughing very contentedly,—then I espied the object of his contemplation in a slow-moving mud-turtle. I don't know why we laughed—unless our spirits were just waiting for a chance, but the mud-turtle had some reason to turn about and laugh at us. “Now run,” said my uncle, “and see if we are to have any luncheon, for I must be going home.” “Where's mamma, Caddie?” I called out as I approached the house. “Sure I don't know, Miss, but she's got company.” “Company!” I hesitated, but curiosity carried it over timidity and I marched on. “Yes ma'am,” was the first thing I heard as I entered, “do you think you will like it here, Mrs. Howard? yes, I do hope so indeed—I shall be so glad,—yes ma'am.” My stepmother was in the kitchen, cap on head and broom in hand, and opposite to her stood a lady who looked as if house-cleaning and moving had formed no chapter of her existence. Not very tall nor very large, rather delicately formed indeed,—her morning dress spotless, a nice little parasol in her hand; while on her head the very pink of pink handkerchiefs selfdenyingly received the dust wherewith our atmosphere was loaded. “And this is one of your daughters, yes,” said the lady as she caught sight of me,—“the oldest I suppose, yes ma'am. How old is the youngest?” “This is the youngest,” replied my stepmother. “The youngest? but my dear Mrs. Howard you surprise me indeed, yes. I hope they will come and see me very often, yes ma'am. And won't you let one of them go home with me and stay till you get settled?—or both of them,— yes ma'am, it would give me so much pleasure.” “There is only this one at home now,” said my stepmother smiling, and I think she could hardly be prevailed on to leave me without her important assistance. But we are very much obliged to you for such a kind offer, Miss Caffery, and for coming to see us in all this dust and confusion.” “Dust?” said Miss Caffery,—“O I have seen dust before, ma'am—yes very often; and I can always breathe where my friends can. Not obliged at all—it would be only a pleasure to me, yes. But I wish you could come out of it for a while.” “I will come and see you as soon as I am out of it,” said Mrs. Howard, “you may be sure of that.” “Yes ma'am, pray do. And do send to me if I can be of any use,—I should be so glad to help you; yes ma'am, I should indeed.” And the pink handkerchief departed, somewhat the worse I fear for its sojourn in our kitchen, and we saw it passing along the walk till it reached the woods and was hidden like a rose in the green foliage. Then Mrs. Howard and I looked at each other and laughed—at least I did—heartily; but my stepmother soon checked herself and then me. “Come,” she said, “you must not let your amusement change into ridicule,—Miss Caffery is by no means a subject for it.” “Who is Miss Caffery?” “One of our neighbours.” “One of our neighbours! I didn't know we had any.” “Have you forgotten the smoke that came out of the woods in two or three places?” said Mrs. Howard smiling. “No, but mamma you laughed at that, so I thought maybe it was nothing after all. Where does Miss Caffery live?” “Some distance below us, on the lake; but I don't think you have seen her house—it is almost hidden by trees.” “But what is she?” “She is a lady.” “Dear mamma, I know that! I mean who is she, and what does she do, and who does she live with?” “She is Miss Easy Caffery, for your first question; and for the second, I shall know better what she does when I have seen more of her. She lives with her cousin, Miss Avarintha Bain—or rather Miss Bain lives with her.” “Alone?” “Alone in the parlour,—I presume they have servants in the kitchen.” “Well they have got a pair of names between them!” I remarked. “But mamma, have we any more neighbours?” “I think it is probable, but Gracie run and call your father and uncle to lunch. If they had not been more forbearing than your chickens we should have been deafened by this time, and they would have been hoarse—which unhappily, chickens never are.” This was our last day of fine weather. We had first a long quaker storm, and then a long storm of some other kind and of most unquakerlike vehemence, with only a day's sunshine between. Rain, rain,—the potatoes washed out of the ground and I kept close prisoner in the house. Now there was literally not one habitable apartment. The bedroom walls were so damp that the windows were dripping with water every morning when we got up,—(Mrs. McNamara could not imagine why we were not sick); and though we managed to get three dusted chairs and a fire when evening came; by day both parlour and kitchen were a compound of paint and plaster—streams of cold air and of soapsuds. If I had but been a mason or a cleaner all would have been well enough. I had no earthly objection to touching either mortar or soap; but merely to see and smell them was not pleasant; and danger as well as discomfort came hand in hand with the damp air from without. As a last resort I betook myself to the garret, and reigned queen of the new floor and the old lumber. It was a dear-bought eminence. There I sat, hour after hour and day after day, with nothing to do, with no one to speak to: sometimes watching the carpenter bees, who thought our rafters were laid for their express accommodation,—sometimes looking over at the misty Moon across the lake; and then wondering wearily what Kate was doing, and whether she wanted me as I wanted her. I wonder at myself now for those long lonely days. I had besought our whitewasher to get me a cat, but the cat was long in coming,—still the mere hope was good, as far as it went. Now and then when I got very tired I clambered down the steep ladder-like steps, and wrapping myself up, went and stood by the painter to watch his upstrokes and down-strokes. Then when the weather held up a little I would run out to see my chickens; but the poor things with their half-grown wings drooping to the ground, looked as desolate as I was; and their shrill piercing “peep! peep!” rang in my ears for an hour after, and gave me the heartache. At length I bethought me of overhauling some of the boxes that encumbered my dominions,—it would be employment if nothing more; and dragging one out to front the window, I set to work. The amount of will in my finger-ends supplied the place of strength; and as the fastenings were also wanting in that last particular, the box—not exactly flew open—but was with some hard work forced to reveal its contents. They were numerous—odds and ends of all sorts; but among them I did find one little volume—a prayer-book. It may be questioned whether prayer-book was ever so devoured. Not the service part—I cared little for that—but the hymns,—they gave me something to do; and many a one I learned in those solitary days in the garret. This held me some time, and then I had another search which produced Mrs. Sherwood's “Roxobel.” The intensity of delight and appreciation with which I read it cannot be told. I was poring over my little red volume one morning, when I heard my name called. Down stairs I went, even to the kitchen, and there stood Mrs. Howard holding in her arms a little grey and white kitten. I should despair of making anybody who had never felt the like, understand how glad I was. My frock was immediately outstretched to receive her, and I carried off my new companion with a charge from Mrs. Howard “not to spoil the cat.” To which I replied, “Ah but she has just come!” And with this universal reason for spoiling—whether cats or children—I was quite satisfied, and petted my kitty to her heart's content and mine. I was alone no longer; and to do the little thing justice, she seemed to think almost as much of my playmate qualifications as I thought of hers. I might have quoted Montaigne. “Who knows whether puss is not more amused with me than I am with puss?”— It was my delight to run dancing towards her, and then to see the raised back and sidelong jump as with outstretched paws she darted to catch my foot. A couple of kittens, kind reader! I fear you think them scarce worth writing about: yet many a time did Mr. and Mrs. Howard stand with pleased eyes and relaxed muscles to watch our gambols on the gravel-walk which was now laid in front of the house. We were taking a walk one day—I and my little cat; and puss was quietly sleeping in my arms, except when some misstep of mine giving her a slight jar she would purr a sleepy little acknowledgement; and wandering on I came at last to the western boundary of our premises,—in this direction not very far from the house. The fence did not divide us from the turnpike, but from the grounds of our next neighbour, Mr. Collingwood. Formerly he had owned our glen, and then a farm road had come through without interruption,—now, where I stood, a barplace cut it in two, and on either hand stretched away the young thorn hedge and its guardian fence. I stood a long time looking over. The road went naturally on, though now the tracks were almost overgrown, and at a little distance from me took a short turn to the right behind the woods. Woods hemmed it in on the left also; but just beyond the turn there was an opening through which I could see a field of spring grain, then more woods, and further still and to the left—as the ground sunk towards the lake—a gleam of its bright waters. The spring air brought almost as sweet ideas as odours; and two phœbe birds were telling each other just what I felt. I had a longing desire to pass on, and to sit in the shade of a beautiful cedar that was drooping over the road. I tried the bars—they were fast, or too heavy for me to move. No matter, I could climb well enough; so putting down my sleepy cat that she might run under I went over, took up puss and sat down beneath the cedar tree. I know not how long I had been there, but I was lost in the attempt to find out how phœbe No. 1 could understand phœbe No. 2, when I heard a loud impatient bark; and as a great dog dashed out of the woods, kitty sprang from my arms with a farewell scratch, and up into the tree. Here was a situation! I was somewhat afraid of the dog, and still more for the cat; so backing up against the tree I alternated between “poor kitty!” and “go away sir!”—while the dog threw his head back, and barked at the limb of the tree with his whole heart. Then in a moment a voice had called the dog off and ordered him home, and the owner of the voice had walked up to me. I believe I looked at him as if he might have been a party to the onset, but a pleasant smile reassured me; and I pointed out the only visible white paw of my little companion where she lay hid, far out of my reach, and asked if he would not keep the dog away till my kitten came down. The danger had frightened me out of my usual shyness. “The dog will not come back,” said the gentleman; and reaching up his hand he disengaged the cat—after some efforts and though she spit at him vigorously—and deposited her in my apron. “I am very sorry my dog has frightened you,” he said,— “does this little cat belong to Miss Howard?” “No sir.” “No?” “It belongs to me sir.” “But me is very indefinite,” said the gentleman smiling. “I thought you must be one of the young ladies from Glen Luna.” 2* “Yes sir, I do live there—at least I am going to;—but I am not Miss Howard, I am only Grace.” “And why not Miss Howard?” “Because my sister is not married yet.” The gentleman laughed, and then as we walked along to the bar-place he said, “I hope this little felina of yours will not be the worse for her fright.” “No sir, but—that isn't her name.” “Are you quite sure?” “Yes sir,—at least I never gave it to her. Do you think it is a pretty one?” He laughed again.— “I see I must call things by their right names,” he said. “Well, when you know latin you may call your cat felina, —at present I would recommend Muff or Tippet; and now shall I put you both over the fence together?—or stay, I can let down these bars.” His strength readily accomplished this, and with a very pleasant farewell we parted. “I am very much obliged to you, sir!” I said, turning round again with the little cat in my arms just as the last bar was replaced. The gentleman rested both hands on the topmost one, and smilingly inquired, “For what?” “For getting kitty down from the tree.” “That was rather an act of justice to kitty than of favour to you, Miss Grace. I was bound to repair the mischief I had occasioned.” “But it was the dog's mischief.” “I am afraid the dog's mischief will always be visited upon me—he is not a responsible person.” “Well I thank you very much sir,—and for letting down the bars for me, too.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. He that will have a cake out of the wheat, must needs tarry the grinding. Shakspeare. “I DO wish I could do something to-morrow,” said I. “Do something to-morrow!” said my uncle Ned. “And what ails to-morrow that it should have something done on it, of all days in the year?” “Because papa is going to Kellerton to-day, and Kate and Stephanie will come home with him to-morrow;—and I do so want to make a fuss.” “There will be fuss enough, I'll warrant you,” said my father. “If you would prepare an anodyne to be administered as soon as they get here, there'd be some sense in it, Gracie.” “There wouldn't be much fun, papa,—and I haven't seen Kate in so long—and one can't have bonfires by daylight.” “Why don't you put up a flag?” said my stepmother. “A flag!—so I might! that would be the very thing. But then I don't know where to put it—and papa will be away.”— “And I will come and do it for you,” said my uncle. “Will you really? O I should be so very glad. But where shall we put it? and where can I get a flag?—O I know!—those red curtains would be splendid!” “No indeed,” said my uncle,—“I have no notion of hoisting Captain Kidd's colours at Glen Luna.” “And besides,” said Mrs. Howard, “the red curtains are too heavy to fly well, and much too good to be let fly at all. But there are some white muslin curtains, Grace, that you may sew together if you like.” “Well—thank you mamma—only I'm afraid they won't shew much.” “Couldn't anything shew better,” said Mr. Ned. “You sew them up, and we will raise the flag on that high bluff that looks down the Honiton turnpike,—the white muslin will make a great appearance against the green woods.” “And then papa,” I said anxiously, “you will be sure not to forget to make them look for it?” “Suppose they are riding backwards?” said my father. “Now papa!—you know they won't be—you mustn't let them. I should be so disappointed if they didn't see my flag after all.” “That shall not be, dear, if I can help it,” he answered with a smile,—“if they can't see out of the window I'll put them on the roof, and if they are asleep I'll wake them up; —so make your little heart easy.” The white curtains were upon my mind when I awoke next morning—indeed I might say that everything else in my mind was curiously wrapped up in them; so that I could hardly get at an idea of any sort, except through the medium of their white folds. It was the fourth of June,—early summer in reality, while in effect it was yet spring; for the season had been very late; but now it was pushing its way with a very lovely and quiet working. The bright sheen of the late rain was upon everything; the trees in a perfect hurry to get their leaves out,—it seemed as if they had grown inches since yesterday, and our plan could not have had finer weather. With needle and thread we transformed two curtains into one big flag, fastened it to the top of a pole, and then Mr. Ned and I set off for the Brown bluff with an Irish boy for standard-bearer. There was no regular path—or we missed it—and many a delusive opening in the woods, many a promising little hill, lured us on to new disappointments. If my will had not been stronger than my feet I should hardly have reached the bluff at all; but once there, the rest was easy. We chose the most promising tree, and then Andy squirrelized to the top, and receiving the pole from my uncle lashed it to the upper branches,—with so many knots and twistings that the future unfastening thereof seemed problematical. And away went the white folds of our flag of truce,— hanging lazily for a moment among the pine boughs, and then rousing themselves and stretching off upon the sweetest possible north wind. If we had foreseen what was before us, we could have shewn no more appropriate colours on our first settling at Glen Luna. We watched the flag for a little, speculating upon the probable distance to which it could be seen, and then turned homeward. The moccasin flowers were fully out now, and in beautiful variety. Some very tall and of the most delicate pink, while in others the rich depth of colour seemed to compensate for a lower growth. My hand was never ruthless in the matter of picking, but I could hardly pass by such beauties; and with some late anemonies, an early wild lily, and corydalis flowers, I soon had enough to dress a vase to put in Kate's room. How weary I was then!—with having done so much and with having no more to do. Weary of waiting for the stage-horn which I thought would never blow; and then fluttered and excited when I heard the faint sound in the distance, and stood watching for the first glimpse of the carriage. We had an April meeting, all round; but the rest of the day was clear sunshine. I remember that we found the first ripe strawberry and the first wild violet that afternoon: that we told everything and showed everything, and yet could not be satisfied with telling and showing;—that we settled down into being very quiet and happy, despite bare floors and confusion. Kate had seen the flag miles away, and had received all the messages that I sent my absent sister through its white folds. “And how do you like the looks of things, Katie?” said my father next morning at breakfast. “The place is lovely, papa.” “And what isn't lovely?” “Why nothing, I suppose,” said Kate rather dubiously— “only I was thinking of what Mrs. Osborne said, `that nobody lived here.'” “Mrs. Osborne said that, did she? Well, if I am as wise for a man as she is for a woman, I make no doubt we shall get through the world comfortably.” “But seriously Mr. Howard,” said Stephanie, “are we to have anything in the way of neighbours?” “There'll be plenty of them in our way, I'm afraid,” said my father,—“if the earth fails us we'll fall back upon the Moon.” “Uncle Ned does not think very much of his neighbours,” said Kate, “and who are ours, papa? what do you mean by `plenty'?” “Plenty, my dear, is defined by Johnson to be `such a quantity as is more than enough'.” “But what do you call enough neighbours?” said Stephanie. “Depends entirely on the kind”—replied Mr. Howard. “If the kind were Mrs. Osborne I should call herself `plenty'.” “Ah papa! you are too bad. Who is there here that we shall be apt to see?” “Why there's your old friend Mrs. De Camp, and our new friend Miss Caffery, and there is Mr. Collingwood's family.” “Mr. Collingwood is only a farmer,” said Kate. “And if he were a fair type of the class, it would be well if all the world were `only farmers'. I am thankful Osbornes don't grow in the country!—Then my dear when I get my stone cottages built, you know we can sell them to whom we please; and for the present we are at least in a wholesome atmosphere.” “Stone cottages!” cried Mrs. Howard. “Why yes,” said my father.—“Ned thinks and so do I that there is more land here than I want myself; and I talk of putting up a few cottages to sell or let.” “And how much would it cost?” “O I don't know exactly—not much,—there's abundance of fine stone on the spot,—they would pay for themselves in no time.” “I don't believe it,” said Mrs. Howard,—“you'll just lay the foundations with dollars and there it will end—unless you are ruined by the means.” “Poh!—I tell you they couldn't help paying for themselves, and I shall set men to getting out stone at once. Ruined, indeed! And by the way I mean to take some specimens of the stone over to—what's the name of the place?—where they are to build this college—Ethan,—I don't doubt the trustees will buy of me, for I never saw finer. I will go now and get some pieces of it before I forget.” For a little while after his departure my stepmother sat eyeing her coffee cup with a somewhat sad expression of face; but then rousing herself she remarked that whatever else was done we might as well get in order. And for many days that was the word. Busily we all worked at jobs too nice and delicate for hired hands,—books could be dusted and arranged by none but our own; and if Mr. Howard's head had not been full of granite and cottages, he would hardly have trusted even us to unpack his precious shells and minerals. But for the time the new hobby supplanted the old. What he was about we could not always tell,—there was great talk of mills and mill-dams, roads and plantations; and Mr. Ned Howard and my father would come bustling in, and desire a dusted table in all haste,—to be as quickly covered with maps and plans. New ones, just finished apparently,—coloured and uncoloured, lithograph, pen and ink, and pencil. Here a road going smoothly through impassable places,—and there an imposing row of stone cottages about which a fine young forest had suddenly sprung up—but that might have been the lithographer's fancy. Then the scene changed to wheels and timbers and foaming torrents,—a half-finished mill-dam, with a cart and horse comfortably carrying out gravel;—and at the bottom a long string of units and tens and hieroglyphics—“wheels —say so much,” and “mill-stones—say so much.” “If you were anybody else I should laugh at you,” said Mrs. Howard one day when she had been listening and looking on. “As it is it comes too near home, and is too serious work.” “A great deal too serious!” said my uncle looking up with a very excited face. “The thing to laugh at will be the profits.” “When I see them.”— “I don't believe you would look at them if they were here,” said my father, whose hobby did not like a check. “And if I am to laugh at the profits,” said my stepmother gently, and laying her hand on his shoulder, “what shall I do when I see the loss?” “Laugh at that too”—said Mr. Howard, but with a change of tone that said hers was not unfelt. “Pshaw my dear,” he added looking up at the eyes that were brighter than he liked to see them, and with no touch of impatience now in voice or manner,—“you don't know anything about the matter—won't that content you?” “It would if I could think so.” “Well think so,” he said smiling and taking her hand,— “have you so little trust in my sense as to suppose that I shall take a flying leap off a precipice?” “But I did hear of a man once,” said my stepmother with an answering smile, “who being upon a wild horse could not dismount, and had to go whither the horse carried him.” A momentary expression of doubt which I had once or twice seen before, crossed my father's face:—then shaking it off he said laughingly, “Never fear—I will make sure that the horse is a tame one.”— And seeing that more words would be useless, my stepmother as usual spoke them not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. A sweet attractive kind of grace: A full assurance given by looks; Continual comfort in a face, The lineaments of Gospel books— I trow that count'nance cannot lye, Whose thoughts are legible in the eye. Sydney. WE were happily resting from our long turmoil,—enjoying the sweet quiet order of everything in and about our new house; and the summer's luxuriance came wafted through the open windows, and Kate was trying her harp-strings, but softly as if half unwilling to lose the merry choir without. “If ye plase ma'am,” said one of our subordinates opening the door after an admonitory tap, “Miss Caff'ry says, when would ye be settled till ye'd come and drink ta with her?” “Has Miss Caffery sent up here, Caddie?” “She did ma'am.” “To ask if we were settled?” “Well I don't just know, Mrs. Howard—it's wanting ye she is—at ta.” “And when does she want us to come?” “Meself doesn't know, ma'am—if it wouldn't be the day.” “Who brought the message, Caddie?” said I. “He's a fine-looking lump of a boy, Miss Grace—with a face as big as me two hands,—I don't know his name, nor he didn't say.” “Tell him to come upstairs,” said Mrs. Howard. “That's what I did ma'am, and I couldn't get him into the house itself.” “And he didn't say when Miss Caffery wants us?” said Kate. “Never a word Miss, only he said, `it's a fine day,' says he.” “I suppose we must put that and that together,” said Mrs. Howard laughing. “Caddie you may tell him—no I will write it.” “And are you going to-night mamma?” said Kate when the note was despatched. “Yes, that seems to have been the request.” “If ye plase ma'am,” said Caddie returning, “he says all the young ladies and Mrs. Howard and the master,—and would you be plased to come at four o'clock, he says ma'am.” “We will be very punctual.” “Well I am glad!” said I—“I do want to see some more of Miss Caffery,—she is so very comical.” “I wonder if there will be any one else there,” said Kate. “I shall be there,” said Stephanie, “and will make you laugh with everybody and at everybody too, if you choose.” “I shall not choose—therefore give all your attention to your own risible muscles.” What a fair, bright walk we had! For a while there were meadows and grain fields on either hand,—then two dark points of forest ran down to the very edge of the road,— then again came fields and distant woods with here and there a house. One stood at the top of a high slope which came gently down towards us, but at some little distance. The turf was beautifully short and green, and the forest trees had been judiciously cut and spared; the remaining ones, which stood generally alone, had a fine roundness of form and luxuriance of foliage of which their very shadows seemed to speak. These spots of sober light set off the sunshine perfectly. Then we passed a house at the very road-side,— brown, unpainted, but having in its window a box of the most beautiful “painted ladies” I ever saw. Then came a little spring running swiftly under the stone wall by the way of a latticed opening,—which lattice served the purpose of a barrier to pigs and geese—they might not run with the stream. And then we approached the place of our destination. “Caffre-land,” as Stephanie called it, was on a private branch of the high road, which forking off towards the lake ran along its shore for some distance, and then turned up to the house. There was neither fence nor wall,—the little cottage stood peacefully in the midst of its green lawn as if marauders were never thought of; and certainly all looked as if they never came. The architecture was in no one style unless that of convenience and comfort; though so far as the steep roof, projecting rafters, and gable ends could make it, it was rather Dutch. The windows were of every sort and situation that a particular view or a particular breeze seemed to make desirable. The front of the house had but one below stairs —a large bay; over and about which a beautiful maurandia hung its purple-blue flowers and abundant foliage. Above this a long oval lookout, of which the sash was slid back into the wall, let one see the waving white drapery beyond; and higher still, a sharp gable reared itself from the roof, which then sloped down until it overhung the bay's side companion,—the little brown front door. The house went by the name of `the Bird's Nest;' though not at all wanting in size and accommodation, yet something in its lichened grey stone and the substantial compactness of its appearance—shadowed as it was by an immense weeping elm on the other side of the road—made the name seem not unsuitable. The elm had been trimmed up to a great height, and through its drooping branches the long sunbeams came from the western horizon to the pretty bay window, unchecked in winter; but now softened by the leafy covert through which they passed. And from among the foliage there shot now and then a gleam like fire, as two Baltimore birds or orioles, darted about their nest which swayed gently to and fro on one of the long weeping branches. All this we took in ere we reached the door. It is opened to us, and we have entered the hall which runs straight through to the back of the house. It is narrow, and the rafters stand out in full relief; but at the side is a large Venetian window, of which the broad centre compartment opens like a door upon the flower garden. And here come in the south breezes—freighted with all the bouquets that ever perfumer tried to imitate. I said there was no fence, but this garden was hedged with the Cherokee rose,—then covered with multitudes of its large buff-centred white flowers. We were in danger of forgetting that we had come to see anything else; but Miss Caffery did not wait long before she came behind us with, “Yes ma'am, it is very pretty, but you must all be so tired,—do come and sit down. My dear Miss Grace, I am so glad to see you! yes, very glad. And these other young ladies—they are most welcome,—yes ma'am, they are indeed. But my dear Mrs. Howard do come into the parlour.” The same pink handkerchief, the same spotless dress, only of finer muslin this time, and the handkerchief had a shade more pink and a half-inch more fringe. But I liked the wearer's looks much better upon a second view. Miss Caffery was not young, but she had taken Time so pleasantly that Time had returned the compliment. Her hair— still unchanged—was of so soft a colour, so neatly parted; her whole voice and action were so gentle and truthful; that one would at a venture have joined her in saying “yes ma'am” to everything she uttered. Perfect repose as her eye was, it was not the repose of shallow water; and her mouth was eminently sympathetic. Very different was her cousin, Miss Avarintha Bain. Tall, dark, with hair so black that one wondered where the colour came from; some mental fever shining out through every feature,—more display in her dress and more manner in her mannerism, Miss Bain acted the au fait in everything; and the perfect delusion which she put upon herself in this respect, made her to be sure, good-humoured and satisfied. There were other visiters already in the room; so when the first little bustle was over, I, the only child there, had time to look about me. Except Miss Caffery and my own family there was very little to detain my eye among the animated objects, and it presently wandered to the inanimate,—they were more satisfactory. A bookcase on one side, a like case of varieties on the other, flanked the chimney and completely filled up the recesses; while in the fireplace itself little brass musketeers mounted guard as andirons. All the wood of the room—cases, furniture, and wainscotting—was very dark; and the high range of the latter contrasted well with the hard finish above. On this hung one or two old portraits—telling amid all their silence that the hopes and fears of the present generation are no brighter, no darker, than those of a century ago,—which have passed without leaving a trace except upon some such bit of canvass. It is a hard thing to realize, that just such a face appeared in “this working-day world,” when that world was two hundred years younger than it is now!—It is like seeing that mysterious sort of shadow where the substance is out of sight. But the child's eye and mind soon left the stately lady for something with which they had more sympathy. Instead of a table in the middle of the floor, there stood a pyramid of basket-work,—dark like the other articles, and rising tier above tier from a broad base to a little nest at the top, where was a cluster of roses,—crimson, white, and blush. Mignionette and ivy, honeysuckle, multifloras and alyssum, looked over the side of each tier upon a bed of heliotrope, geranium, yellow roses, and all the variety of spray flowers and buds that make such beautiful filagree-work about those that are larger and more showy. Opposite the bay a glass door looked into the tea-room; and thither my eyes had just gone—caught by a bright gleam of silver—when Miss Caffery left her older guests and called me to come and sit by her in the window. And for a while she talks and I listen,—pleased to hear the gentle voice even when it tells me a bird or flower story that I knew before. And then we both listen, for a horse's hoofs are coming up the road very fast. They come nearer and nearer, even to the very window where we are sitting, and then I see that the rider is my friend of the bar-place. He bowed to Miss Caffery, then smilingly recognized me, and then, still hat in hand, said, “Have you anything for the post-office, Miss Easy?” “Not to-day, Mr. Collingwood. But you are not going to the post-office? you must stay with us sir, you must indeed. We want you very much, yes.” “Thank you Miss Easy, but”— “O don't give us any buts or ifs,” said Miss Avarintha coming up: “I daresay you're very busy—you always are,— but `when a lady's in the case' you know, and there are half a dozen in this.” “I am afraid `Ladies first and business afterwards' would not be a very good rule for me,” said Mr. Collingwood smiling. “O Mr. Rodney! for shame!—and these such young ladies and you such a young gentleman! Why you deserve to be posted up. Here is Miss Howard and Miss Holbrook and Miss Suydam, and you are leaving the field all to Captain De Camp.” Mr. Collingwood sat contemplating his horse's head so quietly, that except for some slight play of the lines of his face I should hardly have thought his hearing very good; and then looking up with a smile as pleasant as peculiar, he said, “Well, Miss Avarintha, I am just such a young gentleman—very busy, very odd I suppose; but what will you do with me?—I must go to the post-office, and then across the country to Squire Brown's for my father, and then home to write.” “Now Mr. Rodney,” said Miss Easy earnestly, “that is the very thing;—yes sir, you oughtn't to write a bit more, not a bit. You're as pale as your paper, yes.” “My ride ought to have cured that, Miss Easy.” “It hasn't”—she said, with an answering but not assenting smile. “Now be kind-hearted—and go to the post-office and Squire Brown's, and then come back here and mend my knitting needle and drink coffee and tell me all about your dear father. I tried to get to see him to-day, but the sun was so hot I couldn't—and I knew you'd be here or I should have sent for you, yes,—and what Mr. Carvill said in his last letter. It will do you more good than writing.” Mr. Collingwood bowed with one grateful appreciating glance, and saying “If I can, dear Miss Easy,” he rode off. Miss Easy looked after him with an unusual shade on her placid face, but Miss Avarintha walked away; and then up came my stepmother. “Dear Miss Caffery,” she said, “I fear Grace is keeping you here,—do let her amuse herself.” “O yes,” said Miss Easy, “but I like to talk to her—yes ma'am, very much.” “But the wind comes in so fresh—and your face —” “My face?—O yes ma'am,” said Miss Caffery smiling most good-naturedly, “to be sure! you thought I had the faceache, yes. But I always wear this handkerchief ma'am —I do indeed.” “O I beg your pardon!” said Mrs. Howard, quite shocked at her mistake. “No ma'am, pray don't. You see,” continued Miss Easy, so much interested in her story that she forgot the accustomed refrain; “you see when Avarintha first came to live with me I never could arrange my back hair as she liked— because I wasn't a spider, with eyes at the back of my head —as I told her, ma'am; and every day she would say to me, `O Easy! your hair does look so!'—and at last she said that if she were in my place she would wear a nightcap or a handkerchief, rather than let people see such a twist on her head. So I told her I wouldn't wear a nightcap, for I didn't think nightcaps were becoming; but I would wear a handkerchief and welcome,—and I always have, ma'am, ever since.” “I am sure you were very obliging.” “O no ma'am—not at all. Indeed, yes,” said Miss Easy, “it was as much for my comfort as hers, yes ma'am; for I was as tired of the back of my head as she was.” When Mr. Collingwood came back Miss Easy was in the glittering and aromatic region of the tea-table; but Miss Avarintha pounced upon him at once, passed her arm through his, and walked him round a circle of introductions and greeting. Even I could not but notice the well-bred quietness with which he met all her showing-off attempts—they seemed to disturb nothing but the corners of his mouth; and when the circuit was made he walked into the tea-room, and receiving his cup of coffee from Miss Easy stood talking to her for some time. “Mr. Rodney,” said Miss Bain the moment he returned, and pointing out a place somewhat antagonistic to Captain De Camp who was talking to Kate. “Mr. Rodney, there is an unoccupied chair.” “But here is an unoccupied lady,” said Mr. Rodney as he crossed the room and seated himself by poor little me; “and a lady in a dream I should judge. Miss Grace, is it allowable to wake you up?” “Me! O I was not asleep, sir.” “May I inquire then upon what profound subject your waking thoughts were employed?” “I am afraid you would think me very rude, or impertinent, sir.” “No, I will promise not beforehand.” “Ah but you don't know, sir—I am sure you would say I had better have been thinking of something else.” “Possibly,” he said, with a smile,—“but if that be the case you may as well let me give you an opinion, and then you will know for next time.” He had a frank way that was very catching. “I was thinking sir, I was wondering who you could be.” What a merry laugh greeted this speech! “Upon my word,” he said, “I don't wonder you looked abstracted! And you would like to be helped out of the difficulty? But I should think you might have heard my name half a dozen times at the window a while ago,—you seemed wide awake enough then.” “Yes sir, I thought I did hear it; but then they seemed to call you something else, and that puzzled me.” “They did call me something else; but you see I take the benefit of both my names—not having your conscientious scruples on the score of cadetship,—I am Rodney Collingwood. And now to change the subject, or rather the application, suppose you tell me your little cat's name—that I may make no mistake in future.” I hesitated. “Hasn't she got one yet?” “Yes sir, but—I didn't call her what you advised me to, Mr. Collingwood.” “Never mind that—I do not expect to have my advice followed in most cases,—only tell me what you did call her.” “Why sir, Kate brought a little white cat from Kellerton, and it cried all the time for a day or two, and Kate declared she would call it `Mew'; and then I said if she did I would call mine `Purrer-purrer'.” “Why at that rate,” said Mr. Collingwood laughing, “I should have called Wolfgang `Bow-wow' or `Barky-barky'.” —And how we both laughed then! “Is his name Wolfgang?” I said. “Yes,—don't you think he's a fine fellow?” “O very!—but Mr. Collingwood—” “Well?” “Why don't you teach him not to kill cats?” “He has been taught—he never does kill them. But,” continued Mr. Collingwood with a smile, “little Purrer-purrer did not know that—there was the whole difficulty. If she had staid in your lap Wolfgang would not have looked at her; but a dog will almost always chase any animal that runs from him.” “Then it was well I didn't run too.” “I did not mean to include you in the animal class,—I hope Wolfgang would have had so much or so little sense as to prefer the cat.” “The cat is very nice sir, indeed.” “No doubt of it!” he said with a grave look of amusement. “Does she ride out every day in the little carriage your arms make for her?” “It isn't quite fair for everybody to laugh at me about the cat,” I said, but laughing myself. “I haven't taken her out in a great while,—indeed—” “Indeed you were afraid of another fright?” “Yes sir, a little. But that hasn't been all the reason, Mr. Collingwood,—since Kate came home I have had her to think of—and you know I would rather hold her hand than the cat.” “How should I know that?” “O to be sure”—I said;—“but you would if you knew her—I forgot that you didn't, sir.” “My remark referred only to you—not at all to your sister. But tell me Miss Gracie, have you so far forgiven Wolfgang that you will let me bring him to see you some day?” “O yes sir! I wish you would! we should be so glad.— You know you can come through the bar-place, and then it will not give you a long walk.” He smiled at this; but then Miss Avarintha came up, saying, “Mr. Collingwood, you do look so entertaining and agreeable that you must absolutely come and talk to me.” And she kept him in the bay-window until we came away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. A man first builds a country seat, Then finds the walls not good to eat. Prior. “FINE hay weather, isn't it?” said my father, as he looked away from his saucer of raspberries to the beautiful summer light that was upon everything out of doors. “I must be off to the oak-meadow directly.” “You, papa?” said Kate. “I, my dear—I must go over and set those men to work. Ezra Barrington to be sure is a good mower, but the rest will be as like to cut themselves as the grass unless I show them how.” “Why don't you let Ezra do it?” “He won't mow much himself if he has to teach half a dozen others.” “Never mind if he does not,” said my stepmother,— “you are not used to the sun and will just tire yourself out.” “No, I'll stop short of that,” said Mr. Howard, eating the last spoonful of cool cream and fruit with complete satisfaction. “But papa,” said Kate, “do you think it will have a good effect on the men?” “Think what will have a good effect?—their cutting the grass instead of themselves?” “No, no,—but your working with them.” “Yes, a very good effect, for they'll have to do something.” “They won't respect you so much—you needn't think it,” said Kate gravely. “Pshaw!”—said my father,—“well, I shall respect myself a great deal more than if I let those six men do nothing all day, so that's settled. And now to put myself in working trim.” “I do wish papa wouldn't!” said Kate the moment he was out of the room. “Can't you persuade him, mamma?” “I shall not try,” said Mrs. Howard smiling. “He will do himself no harm, Katie.” “Indeed mamma, you are mistaken,—I am sure”— “By the way,” said my father coming in at that moment, “I wish you would send over some luncheon about eleven o'clock, and a pail of buttermilk or something of the sort,— the poor fellows will be thirsty.” And he went out before we had breath to remonstrate. “Why they should all bring their own luncheon!” exclaimed my stepmother,—“they are only day-labourers.” “And I am sure there are springs enough in the neighbourhood,” remarked Stephanie rather scornfully. Mr. Howard opened the door again, and putting in his head he added, “I forgot to tell you my dear, that I must take Andy over to turn hay;—but I suppose Caddie can bring the things.” We looked at each other, and then gave one clap and shout. “What is papa thinking of!” exclaimed Kate. “I am sure I don't know,” said Mrs. Howard, “but it's pretty clear what I must be thinking of;”—and she began to roll up her sleeves. “What are you going to do, mamma?” “Make some cake for those men.” “No indeed you must not,” said Kate earnestly. “Just let it alone and they will know better next time.” “Your father would not like that, Katie.” “Well I'd give them bread then—I wouldn't give them one morsel of cake. Now mamma—only look at your little arms and hands, and then think if they ought to make lunch for mowers.” “It won't hurt them any more than `making lunch' for other people, I imagine,” said Mrs. Howard laughing; “and as to bread, Katie, we have but just enough in the house for our own dinner. No, I must make some gingerbread, and then we must go and carry it to the oak-meadow.” “Carry it!—why mamma you are absolutely crazy. Carry a basket of cake and a pail of buttermilk for those men to eat!” “Well,” said Mrs. Howard, “I am quite willing it should go in any other way, if you will only say how. Rose has a sick headache.” “Let Caddie take it, as papa said.” “You know about as much of the matter as he does. Caddie is washing, and I should have to hang out clothes during her absence.” “Well I do think it is rather too bad!” “Now Kate my dear,” said Mrs. Howard with a smile, “you may as well make the best of it. Your father did not think nor understand what he was doing,—he has been a citizen too long to turn farmer at once; but this will not happen again, and the day is not so hot that we shall find the walk disagreeable.” “Stephanie and I will go with the basket,” I said,—“she is old enough to escort me, and it would be clear fun.” “Very poor fun indeed,” said Stephanie. “Why the sun will make our hands as black as a coal—to say nothing of the pail's dragging down our fingers.” “O well,” said I laughing, “but I can't go alone you know; so you may carry a piece of gingerbread, and I will hang the pail on one arm and the basket on the other.” “No, we will all go,” said Mrs. Howard,—“I cannot let you go so far without me. I will make the gingerbread at once; and if you Stephanie will sew up the fingers of those gloves that I saw lying about this morning, I think they will protect your fingers sufficiently.” “Don't put any carraway in your cake ma'am,” replied Miss Holbrook, “because it might be mistaken for hay seeds.” “Carraway in gingerbread! you foolish child.” “My dear Mrs. Howard, I assure you that combination is not unheard of. You are not quite read up in your cookery book, ma'am.” “I must grant that,” said Mrs. Howard smiling. “But mamma,” said Kate, “in the abstract you know— don't you think it is very bad policy for ladies to do such things?” “In the abstract Katie, I think books are pleasanter companions than flour-pails and boxes of sugar; but I have a poor opinion of the lady who is not woman enough to do anything that comes in the way of her duty. The less of such delicacy of hand we have, the better; and you must not grow up to practise it.” “You'll never practise anything else”—said Stephanie when we were left alone,—her own disapprobation having faded before the amusement of seeing Kate's. “Miss Howard—how will you dress yourself for the hayfield?” “In my sunbonnet.”— “But my dear you might be mistaken for a farmer's daughter. Do at least take a fan—and a bottle of smelling salts.” “I doubt the hay is sweeter.” “But more trying to delicate nerves—when combined with baize jackets. Think of your being obliged to behold those articles, after all!” “Stephanie,” said Kate, “you ought not to try to aggravate my notions till you are sure they are wise and right,— or until I am.” “I am wondering,” said Stephanie, “what name you will bear in this region. Mr. Howard's chief support in the farming line has given me the pleasing title of `Miss Ste Fanny' —I am curious as to the probable cognomen of Miss Howard a few years hence,—in most circles of society one might guess—but here—” “I hope Miss Howard will always be herself,” said Kate composedly. “In other words, that she will always be Miss Howard?” “She might easily be a better thing,” Kate said, so gravely that Miss Holbrook took up her gloves and was silent. The sun looked hotter than it felt; and we who walked quietly through the thorn-hedged lane, had often a cooling wind and shade. But when we reached the oak-meadow we found a most glowing atmosphere, and all the mowers in their shirt-sleeves. Sometimes these were partly rolled up, disclosing the red flannel undersleeve; and coats and jackets hung from the trees or lay scattered about on the swath. Even Mr. Howard had adopted the prevailing fashion, (to the dismay of Kate and Stephanie); and was now watching the irregular mowing of the Irishmen, which formed a strong contrast to the long, steady, and even sweeps of Ezra Barrington. Besides the fresh swath, a part of the meadow was spread with half-dried hay which Andy was turning; and in one place it was even gathered into winrows. Several rakes stood upright on their sharp-pointed handles in different parts of the field; and its central and naming tree—a great oak—cast a broad shadow that was ever shortening. We stood on a little rising ground looking over the fair scene, and presently my father espied us and sent one of the mowers for our load. “We put some ice in the pail,” said I, “and now if you set it in the shade it will keep cool.” “Ya-as,” said the man, who had a good-natured, pleasant face, “vera true,—I'll put it by the big tree there beyont.” “And here is some gingerbread.” “Och it's too much trouble!” said the man. “Indade thin, Miss, we're intirely thankful t'ye;—for it's a vera hot day, surely.” We watched him as he descended the hill, saw the others gather round, and smiled to see the little shake of the head with which each man finished a cup of the iced-buttermilk— `the Squire' being first served. The wind was blowing very softly, just bending the tops of the uncut grass and stirring the long winrows and waving my short hair. It was hard to regret anything that had brought us to a scene so lovely; and we did not move until my father joined us. “Now papa,” said Kate, “do you think it is well for a gentleman to go about with his coat on his arm?” “Very well,—when he doesn't want it on his back.” “But papa it looks so.”— “Hum”—said Mr. Howard, “I don't see why one may not follow a country fashion as well as a city fashion—when one is in the country.” “It isn't the fashion—that is just it, papa,—you wouldn't see any one else do so.” “I beg your pardon,—if you go over to Daisy Lea this morning I don't doubt you will find Mr. Collingwood and his son making hay in as comfortable gear as I am. To be sure they are `only farmers'.” “I don't believe you would ever see Captain De Camp looking so, Mr. Howard,” said Stephanie. “Captain De Camp's epaulettes are a part of himself,” said my father a little impatiently, “which happily my coat is not. Come, I don't want to hear any more of this,—if my respectability lies so near the surface and is so easily got rid of, I can't hope to keep it long, any way. Neither Captain De Camp nor any other youngster would hesitate to pull off his coat if he were going to row you on the lake,— but a moustache seems to confer as many immunities and privileges as a seat in the House of Lords.” “I thought you were so very notional and particular, papa”—Kate said in a low voice. “I always shall be, my child—about realities,” he answered kindly,—“these false landmarks of breeding I take no note of. I make some distinction of time and place, Katie,— if I sat in the drawing-room without a coat, you might justly complain of me.” Stephanie shook her head, and Kate walked on with a grave look that seemed to say she could neither give up her own position nor attack my father's. “I can't conceive, papa, where you ever learned anything about mowing!” “I have learned a great many things when you were not present, Katie,” said he smiling. “But you never had to do it?” “Never.” Kate looked better satisfied. “I don't believe you know any too much of it now, papa,” she said with a laugh,—“I daresay Ezra Barrington was not pleased with your performance.” My father looked at her for a moment as if her words had not quite pleased him; but whether he had some feeling for the notions that were in such a fair way to be rubbed off, or whether he thought Kate might indemnify herself for a morning's discomfort, he at all events left her remark undisputed. It was destined to be a day of trial. Mr. Ned Howard had arrived during our absence, and feeling thirsty he had betaken himself to the dairy—but found neither skim-milk nor cup,—only the long rows of pans which were creamed to a most tempting degree. Mr. Ned went down to the edge of the lake, searched about till he found a long hollow reed, and then returning to the dairy he proceeded to imbibe the lactic fluid, in a way which it must be owned, is one of the very best. Our arrival cut short the performance; and Mr. Ned, reed in hand, came out of the dairy with a degree of fun and enjoyment in his face, that might have disarmed anybody's resentment. Resentment Mrs. Howard did not feel; but she remonstrated and Kate argued, and Mr. Ned only laughed the harder. “Where have you been?” he said as he caught sight of my father. “Tiring myself to death with those mowers.” “What, in the hill-field?” “No—in the oak-meadow.” “Why brother I am surprised at you! the grass in the hill-field is a great deal the ripest,—it is just fit to be laid by the first high wind.” “Ezra Barrington thought not,—he said the meadow would suffer most.” “I'll tell you what,” said my uncle looking round with a stern face, “it's my opinion that Ezra Barrington leads you all by the nose—yes every soul of you.” It was our turn to laugh now. “Well,” said my father when he regained his gravity, “if he leads us in the right direction it don't much matter;” and then skilfully throwing in some word about improvements, they both dashed off into granite and mills and cottages, until—making allowance for the anachronism—one would have thought the one speaker to be Crœsus and the other Rothschild. Mrs. Howard sighed, and once or twice looked up as if she would have ventured an opinion; but the mill-stones and blasted rocks that were flying about might have deterred more courage than hers. “Are you looking so grave about me, mamma?” Kate said when we went up to dress. “Are you afraid that I shall grow up a fine lady? If I have a great many follies, you do not think them incurable?” “No dear,” she answered smiling,—“they are anything but that. I was not thinking of you at all, except indirectly, —I was thinking of this wild system of improvements. It seems to me Katie, as if your father was going to fill the hopper of that mill out of his own pockets; and once in, the dollars will rattle down till there is not one left.” Rattle down! if my father had had the use of his senses he might have heard them even then. I think he never went out without a bag of dollars to put somewhere. It was not only on the mill-dam—but here they were laid down on some new road instead of paving stones, and here they went up in the air per force of gunpowder; and another time were exchanged for a new pair of farm-horses— though we had five already. But alas! there was no transforming back again;—whenever this was attempted, mill and roads and horses became all dry leaves. Then as ill luck would have it, Squire Suydam's gardener got hold of Mr. Howard with a plan for raising fruits out of season—out of reason it might have been called; and what a pile was raised there!—or several piles,—we thought they were only stone and mortar but I know now they were dollars. I say ill luck—for the fable declares that when Fortune once found a boy asleep by the side of a well, she roused him, saying, “Pr'ythee child, awake; for if you should fall in people would lay all the blame upon me.” Then there was the haying,—but whether it did not cost more than it came to, “is” as Sam Weller says, “a matter of opinion.” My father tired himself out systematically, for the hayfields were far off and the weather July. Had less been undertaken, Ezra Barrington's practical sense and steadiness could have kept things straight enough; but the power to make so many ends meet, never existed save in the mind of a speculator. And so the season wore on; and we young ones sported like butterflies, nor realized that winter was coming. And Mr. Howard was the busiest of bees;—but he made one grand mistake,—instead of filling his cells as fast as they were finished, he went on adding comb to comb while not one contained any honey. And what did we butterflies care for that?—Nothing. We thought the making cells was very pretty work, and had no doubt but they would be running-over full some day, and some how. So thought my father. Mrs. Howard to be sure had misgivings, and often looked grave and sometimes remonstrated; but what was her one word against the combined forces of my father and Mr. Ned? Meantime the flowers faded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. Cry, holla! to thy tongue, I pr'ythee; it curvets very unseasonably. As You Like It. NOW in all this time neither Mrs. Ned nor Mrs. McNamara had ever been near us,—of course we never saw each other except as we occasionally met at other people's houses or at church. My uncle tried to make it out that the initiative lay with us; but though my stepmother said little in reply, she rightly felt our claims as strangers, and would by no means make the first move. Once after a long drive with my uncle I had sat in his parlour for a few minutes, but the visit produced nothing except a question from Mrs. McNamara as to whether our new oven baked well and who made the bread. So our intercourse was restricted to messages and inquiries, of which my father and Mr. Ned were the medium. Other visiters we had had;—Captain De Camp and his mother (when the former was at home), the ladies from the Bird's Nest and now and then an inroad from the Moon or a deputation of neighbours. The Collingwoods, father and son, had called once or twice when we were out, and on the afternoon of our haying expedition Mr. Rodney came again. Stephanie, Kate, and I were alone in the study, having resigned the sitting-room to my father's slumbers and Mrs. Howard's letter-writing; and as the gentleman saw us in passing, we admitted him by the private side-door near which we sat. Stephanie immediately began with, “O Mr. Collingwood, I am so glad to see you. I have been wishing every day that you would come.” He looked all surprise, that was not attention, but ventured no reply. “Do tell us something about those good ladies down yonder that you seem to know so well. What sort of people are they?” Mr. Collingwood hesitated a moment, and then said with a somewhat singular grave expression, “May I be excused Miss Holbrook for asking a more particular description?—it so happens that I know a good many ladies in the neighbourhood.” “I don't believe you're in the least doubt as to which I mean,” said Stephanie,—“those inhabitants of what they call the Bird's Nest and I call Caffre-land,—who gave us such remarkably good muffins the other night.” Again Mr. Collingwood paused, thoughtfully dressing the leaves of a rose which he held in his hand; and it seemed to me that some feeling of pain shaded his smile when he said, “Miss Holbrook, you ask me a question and then in the same breath give me good reasons why I should not answer it.” “Why what do you mean! I haven't done such a thing.” “I beg your pardon,—you first reminded me that I know these ladies very well, and then that they have tried to entertain you pleasantly at their own house.” “Just the reasons why you should answer. If you didn't know them you couldn't, and if I had never been there I shouldn't want you to.” “I knew a lady once,” said Mr. Collingwood, “who whenever she was questioned too closely about a friend would reply, `O I cannot tell you—I have eaten of her salt;' and I must confess that even I have a little of the Arab about me.” “It is very strange they should feel it as they do,” said Kate,—“that so nice a point of honour should be more universally recognised among those wild tribes than in any civilized society.” “That is not the only flower of savage life: very few people practise hospitality after the manner of our North American Indians.” “I hope very few people practise teazing after the pattern of our neighbours!” said Stephanie. “Don't you think the world has rather gone back by dint of civilization?” “Not at all!—but I wish it would go further forward. And I would not refuse to copy a fine example, even though it were found only in Arabia.” “Or Caffre-land”—said Stephanie. But the person she addressed neither looked up nor spoke for a minute, and when he did speak it was not to her. “Miss Howard, did you ever notice the beautiful arrangement of the petals of a fine rose?” “I believe I have noticed that it is beautiful. What analogy were you thinking of, Mr. Collingwood?” He looked up then with a smile of pleasure at her quick tracing of his thought. “Might not one compare it to the balance of a fine character? where every quality holds its due proportion and place; where those which must come into every-day contact with the world are unfolded like these outer petals, with yet a leaning towards concealment; and where there is always a hidden treasure folded away out of sight, which we judge of by what we can see of the rest, and by the exceeding sweetness it sends forth.” “Your picture wants touching up”—said Stephanie. “Why don't you add that like the rose, a fine character always blushes at being infolded?” “That would be too obvious a remark.” “Obvious! Well, now that you have kindly given the rest of the company something to think of, will you satisfy my curiosity?” “If I can without dissatisfying myself,” he said with a smile. “Very well then;—but in the first place I think you are all crying up the Arabs for nothing. I never heard that the salt-protection tied anything but their hands. If you come to robbery and murder, there may be some sense in it.” “`Who steals my purse, steals trash'”—answered Mr. Collingwood playfully. “But what has that to do with the matter? now don't be absurd,—I thought you were a person of such extraordinary sense and all that—at least so says Miss What's-her-name,—I never shall get along unless I give them some cognomen that I can remember. Let me see—I will call one `yes ma'am', and the other”— There was a flash of indignation in Mr. Collingwood's face that surprised me; and as his quick glance came from Stephanie to us I was too happy that we were looking grave. Stephanie herself stopped short; but determined not to show her discomfiture she directly added, “But tell me how you like that name, before I look for another.” The flash had passed away, and it was with a very grave, almost sad politeness that he said, “I think you can find none better, Miss Holbrook, if you have neither respect for Miss Caffery's excellence, nor sympathy for anything in her that you might wish other wise.” The reproof was too just to give offence—even Stephanie felt that; and now waked out of her thoughtlessness could see that it had carried her too far. But she did not speak nor did we. Never had crickets such an audience, as the scores that were then performing. I sat looking out into the fading sunlight, and wishing most intently that the silence might have as speedy an end, when my eye suddenly perceived a slight motion of the half-open door. Slowly it moved in, and a little startled I touched Mr. Collingwood who sat next me. He turned, and at that moment the door swung clear back, and we saw the fine head and shoulders of Wolfgang. I am sure we were all obliged to him, and drew breath more freely. “O no—don't send him away!” exclaimed Kate and I together, half answering half anticipating a gesture. The dog stopped and looked at us. He was a very large hound of the old Talbot breed, deep black, except where upon the muzzle and legs that colour changed to a brownish red; and with large deep set eyes, finely curved nostrils, and broad and very low hanging ears. He stood for a moment, and then walking up to his master he laid his head on his lap, and looked up with all the love and confidence of a child for its mother; yet with a shade of humility, of conscious inferiority, which made the expression of his eye very touching. I saw Mr. Collingwood's own glisten as he passed his hand over Wolfgang's head. “I never can meet the eye of a fine dog without being moved,” he said at length. “But what makes it look so?” I said,—“what is he thinking of?” “Nay there you ask too hard a question,—it would be as difficult for me to read all his thoughts as for him to read mine;—and yet in a way we understand each other perfectly.” “He has beautiful eyes!” I said. “But what do you see in them, sir?” “Miss Grace, when you have been coming home at night did you never look with particular pleasure at the windows?” “Very often.” “And why were they so attractive?” “Why because of the light within.” “You have answered your own question as well as mine.” “Then you think, Mr. Collingwood,” said Kate, “that Wolfgang is a sort of animated Baku—with a perpetual fire in his head.” “In his head or his heart,” said he smiling,—“I don't quite know where it should be located. But I am sure it shines out through his eyes, and gives this half melancholy, half resigned expression which tells his consciousness of having less intelligence than I have—poor fellow!” And Wolfgang shut his eyes, and drew one deep breath of satisfaction. “Mr. Collingwood,” said Kate, as Stephanie left the room to see what a knock at the front door might announce, “will you let me ask you one question?” “Will I let you, Miss Howard? Surely that is one you need not ask.” “Yes I need, for I want you to explain yourself a little, —do you think it is wrong ever to criticise people?” “You are reproving me now,” he said with one of his pleasant smiles. “Indeed I am not—I have no right,—I am simply asking your opinion.” “I don't know but I deserve a reproof,” he said after a moment's thought,—“not for a bad intention, but for the wrong working out of a good one. To your question, Miss Howard, I believe I must answer yes and no.” “And you must please to explain,” said Kate. “I think then,” he replied, “that it all depends upon the how and the to whom. To say that members of the same family, or very near friends, ought not to speak to each other concerning the looks or character or manner of other persons,—would be to abridge that freedom of speech and thought of which I am a strong advocate. But one may talk and even laugh about such things, without a touch of ridicule or contempt.” “And you think it is not right to speak of them to strangers?” “I think if you mention the faults or infirmities of one person to another who knew them not before, you do the first an unkindness which can only be excused by the hope of doing good to the second—either in the way of warning or example; unless always the friend to whom you speak is judicious and trustworthy, and can see things with your own friendly eyes. So I think,” he added as he rose to go, —“I wish I were always quite true to my own convictions.” “But Mr. Collingwood,” said Kate, “I don't quite understand—we haven't got to the point yet.” “Because you are afraid to bring me to it,” said he smiling. “Why did I speak so rudely to Miss Holbrook? —is that what you want to know?” “You did not speak rudely at all; but why was it wrong for Stephanie to speak of these ladies to you who know them better than she does?” “It was not in the least wrong for her to speak of them to me or to any one else, unless in a way that—forgive me —she ought not even to think of them. Words are not much—it is the feeling which prompts them.” “Then you do think one ought not to laugh at people?” “I think,” said Mr. Collingwood gently, “that it is dangerous to indulge oneself in ridicule, especially of personal defects or failings which are now, at least, beyond control. But I beg you to make every needful apology from me to Miss Holbrook,—perhaps I felt and spoke too strongly, for Miss Caffery is one of the few really good friends I have ever had.” “We all liked her very much,” said Kate, “she is so very gentle and pleasant.” “It is more within than without. Upon a naturally fine moral temperament, has been built up that superstructure without which mere natural qualities are so unsatisfying, so unreliable—a lovely, well-developed christian character!” How warmly he spoke! how like a chill fell his words upon both our hearts! We had it not—that beautiful superstructure. I felt the shade gather upon my own face, and as I instinctively drew near Kate and looked up to hers, I saw the shade there—saw my own tears reflected beneath her drooping eyelashes. He said no more, but stood looking at us for a moment, and then with one kind clasp of the hand that emphasized his words, that seemed to tell of sympathy in his eyes too, he left us. And we sat down in the gathering twilight hand in hand, and thought; until I, weary with the unusual excitement of feeling, laid my head in Kate's lap, and knew nothing more till I felt her lips upon my cheek, and heard her voice say that it was bedtime. “It don't signify—” said Stephanie as she tied on her nightcap,—“I daresay I oughtn't to have said what I did about Miss Caffery, and I won't give her any name but her own in future; but nothing shall prevent my calling t'other one `the Bain of my life'.—My mind's made up; and I won't `come about' for any Collingwood that ever set sail.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. I wear the hoop petticoat, and am all in calicoes, when the finest are in silks. Spectator. I SAID the season wore on; and yet it was hardly that, it rather flew. Flew very quietly, for the two or three people we liked best to see came but seldom; and not even “Miss Howard” would leave her books for mere bonnets and coats, unless when it seemed absolutely necessary. So morning visiters were left to my stepmother and to Miss Holbrook—who was sufficiently amenable to the charms of society—and Kate and I kept ourselves as usefully busy as Mr. Howard could desire. Stephanie often joined us and would work in good earnest for a while; but a double rap would always banish Euclid and set her to speculating upon `who that could be'. In the afternoon we were of course altogether and saw whoever came; and as Kate's habits became better known it did seem that the late circle increased at the expense of the early one. At all events we had company enough to keep us from loneliness, and for the rest we amused ourselves with Kate's harp, reading, flowers, walks, and the moonlight reflections in our lake,—“Luna and Luna” as we called them. Early in the fall Mr. Ned Howard removed to Baltimore. This was a sudden determination, but he had grown tired of the Moon—or his wife had, which answered just as well—and after very short debate and preparation they went;—we paying and receiving one farewell visit. This change was a trial to us all; and we looked sorrowfully at the deserted house, and thought of the kind heart and smile that had so often come to us from thence. O what a blessed thing that man has not foreknowledge!—how even then the lines of circumvallation were drawing closer and closer to our citadel, and we knew it not! It had been matter of grave deliberation as the cold weather drew on, where we should spend it. To have town life and country life succeed each other had always been our intention. But now that hopes and interests and means too, were fairly shipped upon “the full tide of successful experiment,” Mr. Howard thought he had better look after them; and perhaps felt that one establishment speeded the dollars quite fast enough,—so we concluded to winter at Glen Luna. Plans and debates on other points were called for, but that was in the in-door department. The fact was, that the stream of dollars did not run our way; and we found it not always easy to intercept and turn them to our own purposes. And when they could not be had, of necessity a substitute must,—such a one as woman's wit can furnish. “But if we are to stay here, mamma,” said Kate one morning, “we must at least go to town for a few days, to get winter dresses, and all that, you know.” “I think we shall need nothing but what we have,” said Mrs. Howard musingly. “Why my dear mamma! there is not one of us but Stephanie that has even a bonnet; and as to wearing those we had last winter, they are a great deal too slight for the country,—the first wind that came sweeping over these woods would go right through them—the bonnets, I mean.” “I know that, dear Kate—we cannot wear those—but I think we can do without any. You know since Mr. Cary was taken sick there has been no church to go to, and there is like to be none; and for all purposes of walking I am sure nice hoods will answer very well,—for them we have materials.” “But visits, mamma?”— “All the neighbours we need go to see on this side are very few and very near, and sensible. I know Miss Easy would welcome a hood as heartily as a bonnet. Visits at the Moon may wait till spring.” “Yes,—to be sure,” Kate said; “but it seems very strange mamma, and I don't quite see the reason of it.” “I hope it will not be so, long,” said Mrs. Howard, “but at present your father has a great deal on his hands.” “Yes, mamma, but I cannot conceive what that has to do with our dresses,—it seems to me that we are the most important.” And Kate looked up with an air that quite rivalled Don Quixote in his defiance to windmills. Mrs. Howard's face rather grew graver and sadder. “I don't care much about the thing itself,” Kate went on, —“it is not that,—but the principle, mamma—the reasonableness.” “There are few principles more important to a woman, my dear child, than that of patient submission to circumstances. They are very seldom brought about by her own agency,—her work is not to build, but to beautify; and that may be done in a log cabin. Money is less plenty than it was, and we must try to see how little we can cost. We have nice dresses enough for visiting, Katie, and at home calicoes will best suit our means and therefore best suit us. I shall like to see how you will beautify them,” she added with a smile. “How many things which I call impossible or wrong, you prove to be possible and right, mamma,” said Kate. “I wish I could always take the right view of things at first!” “To be sure of doing that,” said my stepmother, fondly passing her hand over the fair brow that was looking so thoughtful; “to be quite sure of taking the right view of things, Katie, one must always take the right stand,—upon duty and not upon inclination. But if you sometimes make a mistake, you never refuse to see and own that your position was a wrong one.” The calicoes were sent for and we made them up—for the first time. I thought myself quite dressed in one, especially when I wore too an apron of new white cotton. Ah I was a simple child! but so little had dress ever been a part of ourselves, that the transition from one style to another seemed very slight. It mattered but little to our light hearts whether caterpillars or jennys spun for us. Mr. Howard knew nothing of all this—it may be questioned whether he even knew that we had asked him for very little money. If we had proposed the question of calico vs. silk, he would have said, “Have anything you want—there is money enough,— just make out a list and I'll get you fifty yards of anything.” But we knew there never could be money enough while there were too many calls for it; and our debates were quietly settled without a reference. As to the mere fact of our wearing one thing instead of another,—if Mr. Howard noticed it at all, it was probably to remark upon our taste instead of our economy. My stepmother knew better, saw clearer, than he did, which way improvements were tending, and made a vain attempt to counterbalance, —it would not do. Things have their due weight only in the philosopher's apparatus,—where “A lord and a lady went up at full sail When a bee chanced to light on the opposite scale.” Late in October my father left home for some time on business, and came back as we thought in remarkably good spirits. But we got no clue till tea was over. “Well!” he said with a vigorous shove of his tea-cup, “I've been buying some of the most beautiful cattle you ever saw.” “Not buying?” said Mrs. Howard. “Yes buying—to the tune of six or eight. Let me see,” —and taking a paper from his pocket he went on. “There is first `Lady Howard' (she shall be yours Kate my dear),—a beautiful frosted Durham: I think she's the finest creature I ever set eyes on.” “That's well,” said Kate laughing—“I shouldn't like to have mediocrity bear my name.” “She's handsome enough to bear anybody's name,” said my father enthusiastically, “and has more fine points than I ever saw in any other animal. Then `Snow-drop'—a white two-year old. `Auld Reekie'—a fine Ayrshire heifer.” “But my dear father,” said Kate, “who did help you with that list of names?—Edinburgh isn't in Ayrshire.” “They both happen to be in Scotland,” said Mr. Howard; “and as to the names Kate, the cows may have dubbed themselves for all hand I had in it. Well, next comes `Duncan Grey'—a frosted Durham bull; `Dewitt' and `Lord Clive', two yearlings; and `Sunbeam'—an eight-months' calf that I think may prove the finest of the lot. She's a perfect beauty.” “But what could you be thinking of, to buy so many cattle just at the beginning of winter?” said Mrs. Howard. “What could I be thinking of? a dairy next summer and prize cattle for the fair. Why Van Alstein (who is a very clever fellow, by the way,) says there is no surer way of investing money.” “No surer way of losing it, I'm afraid,” said Mrs. Howard. “But you haven't half enough hay to keep them till spring.” “Plenty, for I mean to have it all cut and mixed with brewers' grains. I must have some mangers put up to-morrow; and I have bought a cutting machine that will make inch-lengths of the hay in no time. Is there a fire in my study? I have some writing to do.” “He is absolutely crazy!” said Mrs. Howard as my father left the room. “Why don't you tell him so mamma?” said Kate. “It does little good to speak when the thing is done; and besides I don't know that I ought. Your father must know his own affairs, one would think,—and yet these `investments' make me nervous.” “But would these people mislead him mamma? maybe it will all turn out as he thinks.” “Well—we will hope so,” said my stepmother with a very unhopeful face. The cattle came, and very beautiful they were, and in fine condition. Even my stepmother was mollified by the expression of Lady Howard's eye as she stretched her tongue over the fence for a turnip. It seemed impossible that such fine creatures should ever look less well and thriving; and the mere step of Ezra Barrington about the yard, gave promise they should not starve to death that winter. We were eating dinner one day soon after this, when Caddie rushed in with “If ye plase sir, the cow's in the mud beyont.” “In the mud? what cow?” said my father. “It's her that was coming from Squire Bulger's, Andy says sir.” “Where in the name of all uncommon sense did she find any mud to get into?” said my father. “Meself doesn't know sir—it's a soft spot some place.” “As high up as Andy's head I suspect. Most extraordinary thing that a boy and a cow couldn't travel the high road without walking into the first ditch they met!” “More cows to be fed!” said Mrs. Howard. “More cows to get out of the mud, my dear—which is the present matter in hand. Have you any rope in the house?” “None but the clothes line.” “Well give me that then! how many clothes lines do you think one cow would buy?—study that to restore your equanimity.” And seizing the coil of clean rope which Caddie brought in, my father set off with all the men he could muster to find and help the unfortunate cow. Then Kate and Stephanie and I laughed, and Mrs. Howard looked grave and then joined us,—in which merry mood we finished dinner. “My mind is quite clear now about papa's being bewitched!” said Kate. “I don't suppose he would care if all Philadelphia were to see him!” “He would have small reason to care,” said Mrs. Howard,—“it is none of Philadelphia's business. Your father judges of propriety by his own sense—not by other people's want of it.” “I wonder if everybody else in this region does such things!” “You had better ask Mr. Collingwood,” said Stephanie, —“it's to be hoped he knows something in the neighbourhood besides ladies.” The afternoon passed till long-shadow time, and nobody came back; and then partly anxious and partly curious we walked out to seek tidings. The scene in the barnyard was worthy the pencil of Paul Potter. The cow was alive indeed, but too much exhausted to get up from the sled which had brought her there; and being of a somewhat spare habit she looked none the less gaunt for the coating of blue mud, which left a narrow strip of dun colour along her back bone in rather bold relief. Hard by stood the oxen—loosed from the sled but not unyoked, quietly chewing the cud, and perhaps ruminating as well upon the probable fate of the load they had conveyed out of “the soft spot.” Away off, Andy was holloing after Sunbeam's vagaries, and the rest of the cattle followed in single file the windings of the brook; while cocks strode majestically about the yard and hens hopped upstairs to roost, and the real sunbeams were saying very plainly, goodnight. Mr. Howard stood with arms folded looking at the cow; and Ezra Barrington who was rubbing her head and side with a wisp of straw, discontentedly remarked, “If she'd been taken care of as I take care o' cattle, I'd ha' had her kicken up her heels by this time, instead o' having to pull her out o' the mud!” “What could make you buy such a looking cow, papa?” said Kate. “She's not in very good condition, to be sure,” said my father, “but that is easily mended; and she has some excellent points and will make a fine milker. And now she must have a name.” “Let's call her Lady Bulger,” said Kate laughing,— “which is both an expression of politeness to the Squire and of our hopes that the cow may grow fat.” Even my father had to laugh at this, and we left Lady Bulger and walked back to tea. It became a constant amusement to go to the barn at feeding-time. Even when the weather grew cold and the road was but a beaten track in the snow, we would run over at the end of the short winter day to see the hay cut and distributed, and then to watch the cows as in emulation of human nature they pushed and hooked each other about from manger to manger, nor were ever satisfied with their own. We were all there one afternoon, leaning over the fence and smiling at the strange cries and gestures which Mr. Barrington bestowed impartially upon Andy and the cows; when Squire Suydam's English farmer came by. He stopped and stood talking. 4 “Bad 'abit, sir,” said Roberts shaking his head as Snow-drop executed a most prolonged lick upon one of her shoulders,—“very bad 'abit sir!” “Why?” said my father. “They lick off so much of the 'air sir, and then swallow it. I saw a calf once sir that died—most beautiful calf I ever saw in my life!—and nobody could tell what was the matter with him. Well sir, they cut him open after he was dead; and they found a ball of 'air in his stomach as big as your two fists, sir!” “A ball of air in the calf's stomach!” cried Stephanie. “I've heard of a soap-bubble, but—why Kate what do you mean by stopping my mouth?—I say I shouldn't think that would stand swallowing.” “You may be glad they had both walked away,” said Kate gravely. “Why? you think I should have had a lecture? Not a bit,—Mr. Howard would have laughed—he couldn't have helped it.” “But just suppose Roberts had heard you.” “Fiddlesticks! do you suppose he would have been scared at the sound of a little h'english? Come, let's go home,—they won't have done their talk in a week, and `By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes',— so I don't want to wait for it.” “Will you go mamma?” said Kate. “No, I shall stay for your father. But you had better all run home as fast as you can—it is getting very cold; and Andy is just going with the milk so you will have an escort.” “He will”—said Stephanie. “My goodness how he would run if anything appeared `suddently'! I think I see the capsizing of the milk-oails. And how you do run, both of you! do stop!” “But I am so chilly.” “Stop, nevertheless,—in other words moderate your pace —in other words walk slower. If you go rushing into the house at that rate, you've no idea what you will rush against. What do you suppose I meant by `the pricking of my thumbs'?” “Nonsense”—said Kate coolly. “Well I meant sense for once. You see while your eyes were intent upon the cattle, mine saw where `a little skiff shot to the bay'; and I have no doubt—just walk and not run round this corner, will you?—that its contents are quietly reposing in our drawing-room. At all events,” added she as we entered the hall, “their caps are at rest on the hat-stand.” Kate gave her one reproving glance, and then composing her muscles, gravely entered the drawing-room. Sure enough we found visiters—Captain De Camp and Lieutenant Henderson,—which last having voted three legs of his chair a nuisance, was quietly balancing himself on the fourth with his head against the open study door. “Fine season for walking, Miss Howard,” said the Captain. “Very fine,” said Kate. “I hope Mrs. De Camp is well enough to enjoy it properly?” “Quite well, thank you,” said the Captain putting his head and neck at right angles. “But don't you think,” said Mr. Henderson, who had a slight lisp, “don't you think Mith Howard it ith very fatiguing to walk in thuch cold weather?” “Fatiguing? O no,” said Kate smiling; “I think it is very pleasant. I get fatigued if I do not walk, Mr. Henderson.” “So do I,” said the Captain. “I wanted to march off after you at once, but Henderson wouldn't hear of it.” “One hath to walk tho fatht!”—explained the Lieutenant. “You would have had a quick step to march to if you had been with us,” said Stephanie. “I don't doubt you would have been fatigued.” “Impossible, I should think, in such company,” said Captain De Camp. “Have you been walking far, Miss Howard?” “Only to our little settlement of barns and barnyard. It is almost a pity you did not take so much trouble as such a walk can give, and then papa could have displayed his new cattle.” “Did you ever know,” said Stephanie, “that 'air is very pernicious to calves?” “Ah?” said the Captain,—“pernicious?” “Very,”—said Stephanie with a grave nod of her head. “I always supposed the more they had of it the better, Miss Holbrook.” That's what I used to think,” said Miss Holbrook, “but Squire Suydam's Englishman says they should be brought up as much as possible on the 'air-tight principle.” The officers stared, and Kate and I were on the verge of uncontrollable merriment, when Stephanie changed her ground. “Have you been bird's-nesting lately, Captain?” “Not lately—no, I have not been there in some time,” said the Captain with a rapid laugh. “Birdthnethting!” said Mr. Henderson. The Captain explained. “O I thee!—Mith Holbrook ith quite thevere.” “But those are excellent people, Miss Holbrook,—they really are, though you would not think it. Most excellent people!” said the Captain with a face of grave consideration. “I should think it,” said Kate quietly. “Miss Howard,” said he turning to her, “you have not seen the new Sulphur spring near the Moon, and the fine building that is being erected for the water-drinkers?” “No,” said Kate. “I should be exceedingly happy to escort you there some day, if you will permit me.” “And Mith Holbrook—” said Mr. Henderson from his centre of equipoise. “Certainly!” said the Captain bowing. “O thpare your `certainly,'” said his friend languidly,— “I will take that honour upon mythelf.” “I will go, in a minute,” said Stephanie,—“and so will Kate—of course.” “I should like to go,” said Kate; and then rather hesitatingly she added, “but I don't think I can.” “I hope I may disregard that doubt. A few days of this weather will shut up the lake, and I assure you Miss Howard the ice is a perfectly safe and pleasant bridge. Will you let me come for you next week?” “But suppose you were to come when I had made up my mind I could not go?” “Then I should at least have the pleasure of seeing you,” said the Captain; and there it rested, and the gentlemen took leave. “You are a strange girl, for a truthteller,” said Stephanie, —“what doubt could you possibly have?” “Whether papa would wish me to go.” They went off upstairs, and as I sat alone in the twilight I heard Mr. and Mrs. Howard come in. “What does that man come here for?” said my father in an annoyed tone of voice. “What man?” “De Camp—I wish he'd do it!” “Do what?” said my stepmother laughing. Mr. Howard vouchsafed no reply but an impatient glance, and then hearing Kate as she came singing down stairs, he walked off into the study and shut the door. “Mamma,” said Kate, “I have got myself into such a scrape!” “Such a scrape?” “Yes—or Captain De Camp has.” Mrs. Howard really looked startled for a moment, as if my father's last words might have been prophetic, but Kate went on. “You see mamma, he wants me to go to the Sulphur spring with him, and I demurred at first, not knowing what you would think of it; but at last I half consented that he should come for me next week. And then, after he had gone, it flashed upon me that I have no bonnet! now what am I to do? and what do you suppose papa would say to the plan any way?” “I will see to that,” said Mrs. Howard; “and as to the rest Katie, I will make you a bonnet.” “O no mamma! you can't!” “O yes I can and will,—so you need think no more about it.” She was as good as her word, and before the next week Kate was provided with a sufficiently nice bonnet; but at the expense of what fitting and trying on, sewing and ripping out! nobody wanted to go through that week again. “The skating is as fine as possible,” said Captain De Camp when he entered our sitting-room Wednesday morning,— “it is perfectly delightful!” “But I hope you are not going to skate back with me?” said Kate. “Certainly not!” said the Captain with one of his strange little laughs,—“on no account! I wouldn't deprive myself of the pleasure of your company Miss Howard, by running away from it in that style. But I suppose I may infer from your question that the doubt of last week is nowhere?” “I found it not quite so substantial as you represent the ice to be.” “Melted away as the ice froze?” said the Captain with secret delight at something. Kate read his thought more truly than he read hers. “I never could understand,” she said, “why gentlemen feel so much amusement whenever they find or think they find, fear in a woman. They are so often mistaken too—as you are in this case, Captain De Camp.” The Captain was quite willing she should say more about his mistakes, but she did not. “That ith becauthe they find tho much delight in coming to the rethcue—ith it not, Mith Howard?” said Mr. Henderson. “The gentlemen ought to know, sir—” said Kate;—“if they do not, how can I?” “The gentlemen ought to go,” said Stephanie, while one of them laughed and the other considered,—“and the ladies too.” “But Miss Grace,” said the Captain, “aren't you going? Come, I can take care of you all—or at least of you both,— I suppose Henderson will attach himself to Miss Holbrook. Run and get your bonnet.” I told him no, and with a very smiling face, for I felt exceedingly amused. There was no touch of shame or mortification in my mind, but it seemed a very funny thing that my reason should be the want of a bonnet, and that the Captain should tell me to put it on, and be quite unable to guess why I didn't. I stood watching the diminishing figures as they crossed the ice, with a feeling that if I could have gone with them it would have been pleasant; but that in the present state of things it was rather amusing to stay at home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. And after him came next the chill December; Yet he through merry feasting which he made, And great bonfires, did not the cold remember. Spenser. WE were to spend Christmas at Daisy Lea with all the neighbourhood. This was the invariable custom, Miss Avarintha informed us: Farmer Collingwood never accepted any invitations himself, but always insisted upon this annual gathering at his own house. For the last two years indeed his health had been so poor that he seldom could go anywhere, except as he now and then made a short visit in the course of his daily exercise; and this, as we learned from the same authority, was the cause of Mr. Rodney's being at home from college. “He won't hear of anything else,” said Miss Avarintha, “though he was getting along so finely,—nothing could persuade him to go back after he had once found his father not quite well; and now he just stays at home and does everything and sees to everything, and studies himself to death besides. I doubt,” she added confidentially, “whether their circumstances are over good;—that is a fine farm too; but the oldest son was desperately extravagant, and I know that Mr. Rodney supported himself at college; so sometimes I think that all this writing isn't for nothing. Easy could tell you, if she would; but she never will talk about Mr. Rodney except to say that there is nobody like him,— which may be all very true you know, Mrs. Howard, and still one likes to hear something more.” It was the perfection of winter weather,—that is of winter weather in clouds; for the sky was softly covered with the grey forerunners of snow, and the wind which had been piercing for the last few days, had now lost both coldness and activity—not a leaf stirred. At least of those that still clung to the trees; but many a one rustled and crumbled under our feet as we and the two ladies from the Bird's Nest walked to the Lea together. Miss Easy was an embodiment of merino and fur, with the tiniest indication of black silk below all; while Miss Avarintha's dress was as usual of the same edition but gilt and illustrated. “The Lea house,” as it was called, was neither very large nor magnificent. It stood near the extreme horn of the lake, but set a little back in what seemed a mere clearing— so thickly did the forest close in around it. This was but a belt of woodland, however, through which little leafy paths led to the farm which was thus fenced off; the trees being now bare, we could see the background of hill and meadow and stubble-fields, with the barns and other farm buildings which were grouped just at the far side of the belt. The house had only one story, but the dark roof seemed to stretch away over enough of that, while most hospitable curls of smoke welcomed us from the four corners. No coal-bin here, but a great wood-shed—filled as if winter were in truth a besieger. Late as it was the turf kept somewhat of its green, and one or two hemlocks thrust out a well-clothed arm from among their winterbound companions. A broad gravel walk surrounded the house on all sides and was overhung by its roof; and the perfect order of everything seemed to have infected even the aforesaid blue telegraphing, which went on softly and steadily as if it had never heard of vagaries. “But they don't keep house for themselves,” said Mrs. Howard with a sudden look and tone of pity for the two gentlemen that were to stand such an inroad of ladies. “O no ma'am!” cried Miss Avarintha,—“my dear Mrs. Howard! bless me, no! They have an English housekeeper who has lived with them always for what I know,— Mrs. Crown—she's a most excellent person. You'll see her at the door—she'll come to meet us.” And she did, and ratified the lady's praise. To say nothing of the snowy apron and jingling keys (to both of which I am partial) Mrs. Crown's face and manner took your fancy at once. 4* “How do you do ladies?” she said with a tone as fresh as the open air; “I am glad to see you indeed! Come in pray—it's right cold; or seems so to me who have come from the fire. But it's handsome weather for young faces,” she added with a smile as she looked at our flushing cheeks. “How is the farmer, Mrs. Crown?” said Miss Easy. “But poorly ma'am, I thank ye—this last starving weather doesn't agree with him. But Mr. Rodney is well.” And leading the way into a room which owned one of the four chimneys and an unusual complement of books, she took off our wrappers and shoes with all the good will in the world. “My mind misgave me it would snow to-day,” Mrs. Crown continued, “and to be sure I think it will to-morrow; but it's held off for Christmas. And somehow I've always thought a stormy twenty-fifth brought ill-luck. Miss Howard there's a death of cold comes in at that casement! I would have stopped it out but Mr. Rodney says the room's warm enough,—he has his table this side mostly, in winter. Won't you please to take that chair till I can undo these fastenings for Miss Caffery?” “Come here,” said the lady referred to, as Kate somewhat unwillingly left the fine view down the lake; “come here and look at the room—I think it is the pleasantest in the house.” “I can't imagine how you can let all these people come into it!” cried Miss Bain with a glance at the cloaks and hoods and muffs that lay helter-skelter upon sofa and chairs, and which were strangely at war with the spirit of home and tasteful comfort which dwelt everywhere else. “I should think it would put you out of all patience, Mrs. Crown.” “Dear me, ma'am!” said the housekeeper, “if Mr. Rodney keeps his I can't say a word,—and he never lost it yet, I do believe. To be sure I wouldn't let that black muff lie on his desk—that did make me feel a little lofty. Thinks I to myself—! And I did speak to Mr. Rodney about it this morning, but he just smiled as you know he does, Miss Easy, and said that when ladies come so far in the cold there couldn't be anything in the house too good for them.” “Has Mr. Carvill arrived?” said Miss Bain. “No ma'am he has not.” “But I thought he was to be here by this time!” Mrs. Crown's loquacity was however suddenly checked; and bending down by Miss Easy she seemed to have concentrated all her faculties upon a sleeve button and loop. “This button is a thought too large, ma'am—or the loop too small. Now is there anything more I can do for you, ladies?” “Not for me, thank you Mrs. Crown,” said Kate, to whose eyes the appeal had rather been made. And thereupon Mrs. Crown gave it as her opinion that “there was nothing in the house too good for some of the ladies—certainly!” We crossed the hall, and filed into a room of very different moral atmosphere from the one we had left. The physical atmosphere was even warmer, for in the huge fireplace there blazed with that slight, quiet noise which denotes good wood, logs enough for a week's supply of an ordinary family and chimney. But instead of the silent sensible books, there was a buzz that one knew was not all about fruits and flowers. The room was well filled when our five selves were added to the Bulgers and Suydams and Browns and McLoons, whom the fire had already driven to the verge of desperation and the wall. Farmer Collingwood sat in his arm-chair by the hearthstone, and Wolfgang lay at his feet—paws stretched out and nose upon them,—occasionally raising his eyes but not his head at some extra noise or bustle. Mr. Rodney was everywhere and nowhere,—at least I never could find him where I looked for him. Now with Miss Easy, now with Mrs. Howard, first with his father and then with mine,— then coming to my quiet corner to smooth down my hair and ask after my little felina, and once to bring me forward and find me a seat by Kate. Then he would be moving some Miss Bulger's chair from a door-crack, or shielding some Miss Suydam's face from the fire; and at last he took a stand by us “to refresh himself,” as he said, “with a little reasonable conversation.” “O Mr. Collingwood!” said Kate,—“you to say that! `A little reasonable conversation'—when you have been talking to ever so many people that we do not know!” He laughed and answered, “You may suppose, Miss Howard, that I wish to think myself a friend, and you and Miss Grace very judicious. But what if I were to follow your example, and beg an explanation of something you said that night?” “With all my heart—if I said anything needing or worth an explanation.” “I am supposing that we are friends you know, and one likes to have a friend's opinion even in slight matters. You said you had `no right' to reprove me—do you think friends have not that right?” “Yes and no,” said Kate laughing; “but you must remember Mr. Collingwood, that I was almost an entire stranger, and—” “And you see that your shot glances,” he said with a smile, for Kate had stopped short in some confusion. “Ah I have your opinion now about one thing at least. But in the abstract, Miss Howard—do you not like frankness and simple plain speaking?” “Very much.” “Then why should it not be practised?” “It should,” said Kate hesitating a little, “there is nothing I love better, only—” “Only the laws of etiquette forbid?” “No, not at all, or if they do it makes no difference,—I was not going to say anything so silly as that. But I can't talk about it Mr. Collingwood,” she added laughingly, “for you will make some other side-application of my words, and be as far from my opinion as you were at first.” “Set me right where I am mistaken, then,” he said smiling. “If I understand you Miss Howard, you think the privilege of plain speaking should be confined to very intimate friends. Now I go a little further, and think that true friendly interest may confer the right, when neither age nor circumstances forbid. If I know myself, I would take reproof most kindly even from a stranger—if it were given in that spirit which is of charity and not of meddling.” “If—but there is the difficulty; and people so generally do meddle that one is afraid of being misunderstood and classed with them.” “Granted; and yet Miss Howard if appearances are to be the rule of right and wrong, do you know where that would land us?” “But,” ventured I, “mightn't one do harm sir if one was even thought to be meddling?” “Perhaps so,” he said smiling, “though I think I always feel the spirit with which advice or reproof is given,—there is much less danger of being misunderstood than people fear—the chief point is, to be sure of one's own motives. But I do not think Miss Gracie, that it is best to peril even appearances for a trifle,—in matters of importance `let every man stand or fall to his own conscience!'” “And how of things that are but incidentally important —that you would neither put first nor last?” said Kate. “Such as?”—he answered with a look of keenness and amusement that rather indisposed Kate to answer. “Nay, if you will not give me an instance, how can I tell?—perhaps we should not agree in our division of classes.” “I am sure you think you would not agree with mine,” said Kate laughing and colouring a little;—“but Mr. Collingwood there are cases of minor importance, and in such what would you do with public opinion?” “What would I do with it?” he said with a smile and a bright lighting of the eye,—“defer to it always Miss Kate—where I could without compromising better things; and where I could not—give it to the winds! Public opinion must be kept in its place; and when it runs counter to my own sense of right, the question is or ought to be easily settled.” “In other words one ought to have a great deal of moral courage. But that is an uncommon quality, and not easy to get.” “Because people take the wrong way to get it, I think,” said Mr. Collingwood. “The man who is brave for nothing, hardly deserves the name; but men will dare every bodily risk for what they love, or rather than desert their standard. And so with moral courage,—let the cause be but precious enough—let the mind but fairly take in the need there is that all lovers of truth should be not only steadfast but active on her side; and that phantom of the world's approval will vanish before the reality of its lost and suffering condition.” “You have got back to the more important things again,” said Kate. “But I think the same rule applies to all, except as you said, to mere trifles.” “I think so. The division of classes would never be fixed. And after all the matter comes very near home. `To thine own self be true! And it must follow as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.'” “That is just what you were telling papa the other day, that you liked so much, Katie,” I said. “Do you always remember everything your sister says and does, Miss Gracie?” said Mr. Rodney with a smile at me or my information—I wasn't sure which. “Not quite, sir,—I wish I could.” We had been too earnestly engaged with our own talk to notice that of other people; but in the pause that followed these last words, Miss Bain's voice demanded attention. “Isn't it very strange my dear sir that your son never thought of acting up to his name?” “Up to his name!” echoed Farmer Collingwood. “Why yes sir,—it's always a wonder to me that Mr. Rodney should have been anything but a sailor. Now there's Captain De Camp went into the army for nothing in the world but his name being Wellington.” “He might better have staid out of it then,” was the reply. “But that's nothing to do with Mr. Rodney, nor why he shouldn't make a noise in the world,” pursued the lady. “Just think sir! he might have been another Admiral Collingwood.” “We don't have Admirals in this country, Miss Avarintha,” said the person spoken of, wheeling about;—“and if ever I trod quarter-deck it would be under the stars and stripes.” “Then you might have been Commodore, which is just as good. Commodore Collingwood has a very distinguished sound—extremely so; and I wonder you never thought of it. There's something so stirring in a sea life—don't you think so, sir?” “Very stirring indeed,” said the Farmer with a look and tone of voice that spoke of some discomfort. “And it's so good for young men to knock about in the world!” added the lady complacently. “Miss Avarintha,” said Mr. Rodney in his way of quiet determination, “will you take my arm and let me find you a seat by Squire Suydam? He made me promise an introduction, and I would bring him here, but you see there are neither chairs nor good place for them.” “Distinguished!” said Farmer Collingwood in a low sad tone, and looking after his son with unspeakable affection,— “Rodney will find it hard to distinguish himself if he spends all his young life in taking care of me!” “That depends upon what meaning you attach to the word, sir,” said my father who was standing quietly before the fire. “The noisy applause of the crowd he may miss; but if the smile of God be distinction, Mr. Rodney is in a fair way for it.” The Farmer took my father's hand with one look of thanks. “You are right sir,” he said, “and yet I am so prone to forget it,—so sure to remember all he might and would do in more active life.” And the last touch of anxiety vanished before Mr. Rodney's word and smile as he came back. It were needless to describe the dinner,—everybody has seen a Christmas entertainment, or read of one, or imagined it. Enough that we had whatever the season could suggest or furnish, prepared and served with all Mrs. Crown's skill and taste. Paper ruffles graced the hams, and “bits o' Christmas” the mince pies; and if the “Alderman in chains” did not look like a goose, it was only because he was contrasted with the original. Parsley and lemons and bread crumbs were at a discount; while pleasanter yet to the eye, was that exquisite neatness and arrangement of table furniture which tells at least one of the family characteristics. “Bits o' Christmas” were bestowed all about the room in every pattern and variety of decoration; the cedar and hemlock beautifully set off with pipsissiwa and laurel and arbutus berries; while the evergreen eagle at the upper end of the room had his eyes of the bright orange capsules of the bittersweet, and looked quite glaring. He played only second fiddle after all, for on a stand opposite the fireplace was a real bald-headed eagle which had been shot in some stoop after a lamb, and then stuffed; and he now stood with wings outspread and measuring more than seven feet from tip to tip, as if to guard all American liberty that was then and there represented. A most superb creature he was; his dark brown plumage well contrasted by the white head and tail, his legs, eyes, and hooked beak of a bright yellow; while the crooked brown talons told of many an encounter with living and dead prey. And so watched we sat down to dinner. “'Twere long to tell what steeds gave o'er, As swept the hunt through Cambus moor.”— How some people reined up on plum pudding, and some upon trifle; and how my father helped a Miss Bulger to the — piece of pumpkin pie, with a degree of gravity that did him credit. How it grew dark as we proceeded,— how the eagles shone out by candle-light,—how we adjourned, took a recess, and then came down upon coffee and wafers and waffles and kisses, until the aforesaid Miss Bulger rode “Alone, but with unabated zeal.” Then there is a general clearance; and amid bustling and talking and wrapping they all go off,—all but ourselves and the ladies from the Nest, who having not far to go have been begged to go the later. And as the last carriage wheels become indefinite, we draw our chairs about the big fire which has somewhat spent its strength by this time, and do what is popularly called “cracking nuts,”—in other words enjoy ourselves. “Mr. Rodney,” says my father, “did you ever realize the importance of a coat?” “Sir!” says Mr. Rodney looking surprised. “Did you ever realize, ever appreciate the importance of a coat?” repeated my father. “Really sir,” said Mr. Rodney smiling, “I believe I have a sufficient appreciation of it.” “Sufficient! but there is the very point,” said Mr. Howard. “Now what part of a man is his coat, sir?” There was such a laugh raised at this question, that speech was impossible; but as soon as he could be heard my father began again with all gravity. “I know if I were to ask De Camp—(I never saw a name less acted up to than his) he would say to me, “A coat, sir, is that without which man is only a framework.” But now Mr. Rodney, you are a scholar and a hard student —give me some satisfactory answer,—what part of a man is his coat? is it the seat of his wits, or his affections, or his business faculties?” We were all too curious and interested even to laugh. Mr. Rodney looked in the fire with a very serio-comic face, and then said. “I should call it only a reflection, sir,—sometimes of his sense and sometimes upon it.” “Then you would not be disposed to adopt a slight alteration of Mr. Pope and say, `Cloth makes “the man”—'?” “On no account!” was the laughing reply. “You see,” continued my father drawing a long breath as if he felt himself relieved, “my mind has been ill at ease on this point for the last six months; and I am very glad to have you agree with my own unfledged opinions.” “But Mr. Howard,” said Mr. Rodney, “am I to have no satisfaction about this mysterious string of questions? It is hardly fair, sir, to set one mind at rest at the expense of another.” “You must explain,” said the Farmer. “Yes sir, we are very curious indeed,” said Miss Easy. But Kate had sprung up, and placing her hand before my father's mouth she exclaimed, “Now papa! if you say any more!—” And Stephanie ejaculated, “O Mr. Howard, pray do not! I don't know what Mr. Collingwood thinks of me already.” “I don't believe he knows himself,” said my father drily, as he took hold of Kate's hands; then looking up, he told her smiling, that “she might either stand there handcuffed or go back to her seat;” and having so dismissed all opposition, he proceeded. “It's nothing very extraordinary good friends, and I'm afraid not at all uncommon. One day last summer I went into the hayfield, and the day being warm I laid aside my coat—unsuspecting mortal that I was!—and not realizing, as I said, its importance. And these two silly girls came over (shall I say what for, Kate?) and there to be sure they found me working without a coat. Well sir, it might a'most as well have been my head. Stephanie quoted Captain De Camp, and Kate gave me an abstract of other people and fairly charged me with having left off to be notional!— which from her lips is a grave imputation. I denied that of course; but not being able to think of any one else of whose common sense I was sure except you two gentlemen,—I declared my firm conviction that at that very moment you were making hay in as comfortable gear as I was. And then afterwards, naturally enough, I began to debate my question—what part of a man is his coat?” “Well Mr. Howard,” said the Farmer with a very indulgent smile, “you have taught us at least one thing—there are no mistakes in Miss Kate's temper.” “No one could be long at finding that out,” said my father affectionately. “But papa—” I said, “Kate did not mean that she thought so,—only that other people did.” “O you gipsey!” said Mr. Howard,—“to come in with your elucidations!—Never spoil a good story my dear—if it cuts your friends to pieces.” “I don't believe Mr. Rodney would agree with you there, papa.” “I'll tell you what we had better agree upon, all round,” said my father,—“that an invitation to spend the day does not mean to stay all night. Miss Easy—I don't wish to hurry you ma'am, but Mr. Collingwood will think we are all singing privately the old song of `We won't go home till morning— Till daylight doth appear.' “I wish you would sing it,” said the Farmer. “My dear sir,” said Miss Easy, “I am quite ready—and very much obliged to you, yes sir, for reminding me. But I waited for Mrs. Howard.” “I did have some such wild notion too,” said my father, “but I recollected that `time and space' are trifles to a lady.” “O papa,” said Kate laughing and stopping short at the door, “I have an indefinite recollection of a gentleman who always writes a page after he is called to dinner!” We were soon ready, and leaving the other ladies in consultation with Mrs. Crown, Kate and I went back to the room where we had spent the evening and to the three figures standing before the fire. “And so Miss Kate,” said Farmer Collingwood taking her hand as she came up to him, and looking in her face with a very gentle amusement and interest; “and so you think that books must of necessity grow mouldy in a farm-house?” “I have said nothing of the sort, Katie,” said my father laughing, as her quick glance brought the accusation. “Is not that your opinion?” said her questioner, still detaining her hand, but very gently. “No sir—” said Kate. “At least,” she added colouring exceedingly. “I suppose it is not true—whatever I thought.” “I am quite sure you are true”—was the satisfied rejoinder—and there were no eyes there that were not well pleased. “I should not venture to be anything else here, sir,” said Kate trying to rally a little,—“Mr. Rodney will think I have profited by his lessons.” “No I shall not,” said he smiling. “Lessons!” said Miss Bain. “Who has been giving lessons? You, Mr. Rodney?” “No ma'am.” “Who then?” But nobody claimed the question. “Did you never hear of taking what is not given, Miss Bain?” said my father. “Mr. Rodney you need not stir— I will see these ladies home.” That however was not listened to; so we sallied forth eight strong. There had been a flurry of snow, but it had passed over; and now the stars were shining out, though dimly; while in the west they were entirely concealed by the thick black curtain of a cloud that hung there. The air had grown cooler and our steps fell quick, and our spirits were as light as the untrodden, unsoiled snow that our dresses brushed from the path. Mr. Rodney walked first with his two companions, then Kate and Stephanie, then Mr. and Mrs. Howard; while Wolfgang and I joined them all by turns.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. Every moment is expectancy Of more arrivance. Shakspeare. WE had a busy week of it. Time was, when both Christmas and Newyear were days of expectation and gilt books,—now, having to make all our presents, one day seemed enough to prepare for; and as we were somewhat belated we had agreed to keep Newyear. Each one had her secrets—each chose her particular workroom or corner; and any other eyes or feet that ventured within the tabooed region were met with little screams of prohibition and dismay. The house was full of mystery,—on the carpet lay strange scraps of silk and paper—from the pantry came no less unaccountable poundings. Things were made of nobody could tell what, and savours came from nobody could tell where. We were kept in a state of delightful uncertainty. “O Kate my dear! how you do smell of varnish!” said I when she came up to bed, Newyear's eve. “I!” said Kate. “You.—What have you been doing?” “Papa has been varnishing a picture—do you suppose that could infect my clothes?” “Can't tell—something has. O me! you are all mastick or copal—whichever it is.” And Kate bent down over me and gave me, as she said, the last kiss for that year. But I think she gave me another when I was half asleep. We had been busy about things we knew not of,—busy all that week in making wings for our spirits—in brightening up our hearts to reflect the sunbeams on that Newyear's morning, till the sunbeams themselves seemed doubled—quadrupled. O people may talk of the spring of the year! there is no spring like that of a young heart. Its fresh leaves, its unexpected flowers, the new life inhaled at every breath; till the spirit swells like a mountain stream, with the numberless rills of pleasure,—like the throat of one of May's early songsters that would fain tell what it feels, but cannot. And so on that bitter cold first of January, we young ones had spring. Our presents were but simple, except that my father gave us each a handsome book: for the rest we had worked slippers and ruffles and needle-books, and homemade bonbonières,—whence the varnish. Then Miss Caffery sent us each a little geranium, and Farmer Collingwood an Indian basket of lady-apples,—so we thought ourselves well off. The moment breakfast was over, Stephanie began to hurry herself and us. “You see,” she said, “it will take us some time to dress, and I wouldn't miss a visiter for anything.” “My dear child,” said Mrs. Howard, “you forget that we are in the country. What visiters can you expect?” “But some might come, mamma,” said Kate, “and it's just as well to be ready.” “They always visit here”—said Stephanie,—“the Captain told me so himself.” So while I went over everything in the drawing-room with my eye and hand (voted the quickest and carefullest in the house) they arranged the cake-basket. “What's all this for?” said Mr. Howard pausing before the table where Kate had just placed it, and coolly helping himself to a macaroon. “Your cake will be nothing but chips by tea-time.” “But it isn't meant for tea.” “What then?” “Company.” “Company!—” it was quite unnecessary to say more; and presently my father helped himself to macaroon the second, remarking, “I suppose I'm in no danger of interfering with anybody.” “Why not?” said Stephanie. “Because there is nobody to interfere with.” “Well now, Mr. Howard, why shouldn't gentlemen come here to-day?” “Why should they?—even granting there were any to come. To be sure I could go over to the Moon and beat up recruits—I daresay I could pick up somebody that is fond of macaroons;”—and Mr. Howard took a third. “Now papa,” said Kate putting her little finger in his buttonhole, “will you please to let my cake-basket alone? —our resources are not inexhaustible.” “But so long as I have enough, my dear, what does it matter?—you can eat poundcake for tea.” Our gravity was so completely overset, that even Mr. Howard's face relaxed a little. “Why should they come, indeed!” said Stephanie. “Because there are three ladies here, and ladies are not as plenty as blackberries in this quarter of the world.” My father shook his head, as if the blackberries had the advantage in more respects than one. “Three ladies!—I wonder where you studied multiplication!” “There is Mrs. Howard, one, and I am two”— “I always thought you were something besides yourself,”—remarked my father. —“And Kate makes three,” concluded Stephanie not noticing the interruption. “Kate is nothing but a rosebud,” said my father looking at her fondly and arranging her hair after his own fashion,— “you need not put her in your grown-up class; and as I am in no haste to have her gathered, the longer she stays out of it the better.” “I have heard of people's doing such strange things as to admire rosebuds and pick 'em too,” said Stephanie. “Not in my garden!” said Mr. Howard, roused to an extraordinary fit of communicativeness—“and if they do admire it shall be across the fence. Let the bud open of itself, but don't try to force it. A terra incognita has its own peculiar advantages. Ah Katie!” he added, half smiling and yet half sadly too, “you are certainly showing colour in spite of me!” And with one kiss on her forehead he left us and the cake-basket in peace. Surely if there had been any Newyear's folly in Kate's head, my father's words had quite cured it. If the colour came the tears came too. But with Miss Holbrook “to the fore” there was nothing to do but dress. “My gracious me!” said Stephanie, “this cold weather sends my hair flying fifty ways, and I should like to keep a little of it at home; for I am firmly persuaded that somebody will come—Mr. and Mrs. Howard to the contrary. Though by the way, Kate, if your father hadn't been sure of it too, he wouldn't have said all he did. But you have your instructions now, my dear,—you can copy the children in the Fairchild family—`stand behind your mamma's chair and nobody will take any notice of you.' Except of course those people who come to look at nothing else. I am afraid to think,” added Stephanie with a mischievous glance, “how large a proportion of our visiters will fall under that head.” But Kate's mind lay too high for the subject—as a mountain-top rears itself pure and fair above the lower strata of clouds. “It don't much matter—” concluded Miss Holbrook,— “so that somebody only comes.” Somebody came,—and first of all, Squire Bulger. He was a heavy weighing and looking man, with a very “slow” face, that seemed as if it must be always in the last century —and a light brown wig; but nothing could be more marked than his politeness. Approaching my stepmother he stood before her with his feet in the first position, and making a very low bow he ejaculated, “Compliments of the season, ma'am.” Then stepping off to the left where Stephanie sat he made a bow some inches smaller, and repeated, “Compliments of the season, miss.” Kate was served with a still fainter performance; and when my turn came, Squire Bulger so nearly stood upright, and gave me so little but “the season,” that I felt not at all flattered. Then appeared Mr. McLoon—in a small whirl of coattails. “Good morning, Mrs. Howard! happy Newyear! How d'ye do Miss Howard? happy Newyear! Miss Holbrook, Miss Grace, hope you're well? happy Newyear! Mr. Howard's out I suppose?” “Yes, he walked down to the Bird's Nest.” “Ah! yes—ladies are so scarce here that one has to make the most of them. But my dear Miss Howard, bless my soul! is that a grave you're digging in the garden?” “No,” said Kate, who would have laughed if she hadn't been vexed; “papa wanted some kind of a frame for cauliflowers, but the ground froze before it was finished.” “Oh—must have been what they call a `cold frame', I should think,—I congratulate the cauliflowers. But do you know it startled me dreadfully,—really Mr. Howard ought to have it covered with boards or something till the `cold frame' gets there. It's quite shocking, you know, to have such things even suggested. Good morning Mrs. Howard, good morning young ladies;” and Mr. McLoon took his disagreeable face and laugh away. We abused him for a while to our hearts' content: then came quick smart footsteps over the frozen ground. “`Scarlet's asy seen at a distance, anyway,'” said Kate laughing. “I am sure that is our marching friend.” Captain De Camp it was, and Lieutenant Henderson, and Mr. Snow Freeman—who had come to see his namesake and help the two officers spend their furlough. “It is a perfectly beautiful day,” said the Captain, his eyes quite rivalling the sky,—“really beautiful!” “We have been birdth-nethting, Mith Holbrook,” said Lieutenant Henderson. “Well,” said Stephanie, “and what did you bring away?” “Only a few straws,” said the Captain laughing. “I should hope so,” said Kate,—“spoils from such expeditions are not creditable.” “I do athure you,” said Mr. Henderson, whose moral nature wanted the archetype, “that when any gentleman thaid `Happy Newyear, Mith Bain,' the replied `Thame to you, thir.'” We all laughed in spite of ourselves; but more at the speaker than with him—if he had only known it. “And then,” said Mr. Freeman, “when Miss Caffery 5 asked De Camp how deep the snow was, he said `about six feet in our lodgings, ma'am.' Too bad, isn't it, Miss Howard, to pun upon my unlucky name?” “And why unlucky?” said Mrs. Howard when the Captain's little rolling fire of a laugh had subsided. “Upon my word I don't know ma'am—except that it's a cold, uncomfortable kind of a name.” “It carries no uncomfortable look with it,” said my stepmother smiling; “and as to coldness, Mr. Freeman, people will have the pleasure of finding out that you are warmer than they had supposed.” “To be sure ma'am,—that never occurred to me before; —and capable of being melted—ha! ha!” “At any season of the year,” said the Captain. “And even by thtarths,” said Mr. Henderson. “I think you are all making a snow-ball of me,” said Mr. Freeman, trying hard not to laugh at his own wit. “Then you'll grow bigger, which ithn't to be dethired,” said Mr. Henderson. Not laugh!—there is a degree of absurdity which unchains all one's muscles,—we laughed till we cried; or till as Mr. Henderson expressed it, “the thtarths were obthcured.” Our next and last visiters were Squire Suydam and Mr. Collingwood, who came rather late and together. “Same to you Squire,” said Stephanie in reply to his greeting; but when Mr. Rodney shook hands with her, the intention to give him a like answer failed; for as she remarked afterwards, “his eyes looked so much like dark port-holes, that she didn't care to throw in a match.” “My father was not well enough to come out to-day, ma'am,” he said addressing Mrs. Howard, “and could only send his good wishes.” “And you must carry back ours,—I think Mr. Howard has gone to the Lea himself.” “I am sure he has mamma—at least I am sure he said he would.” “Is that a corner wherein Mr. Howard may change his mind?” said Mr. Rodney smiling. “He seldom changes his mind—it is only a corner where there might be hindrances.” “And pray,” said Squire Suydam glancing at the book which lay by her on the causeuse, “is it the fashion now Miss Kate to humbug gentlemen into the belief that you read between visits?” “The last Philadelphia novelty, sir,” said Kate laughing. “And what have you got here?—Plutarch! as I am alive! Comparing Captain De Camp with Cæsar?” There was the slightest possible curl of the lips that answered, “No sir.” “And what do you think of the gentleman in question?” “I should think more of him if he had been a gentleman,” said Kate with a cool misapplication of his words,—“I have no great fancy for savage heroes.” “I'll tell you what I think, Squire Suydam,” said Stephanie, “that when a man gets leave of absence for a day to see his mother, it's absurd to spend half of it in visiting somebody else.” “That's what he does with his furloughs, is it?” said Mr. Suydam,—“I thought they came pretty fast. But you can't tell what he gets them for, Miss Stephanie—the present Mrs. De Camp has little to do with it, maybe. So you like modern heroes best, Miss Kate?” “If I could find them, sir,”—she said with a voice and cheek a little at variance. “Find 'em, eh? Well, look sharp and maybe you will.” “Looking sharp might be a destructive mode of proceeding,” said Stephanie, as the Squire turned to speak to Mrs. Howard. “Mr. Collingwood, you are well read in the ancient poets I suppose—do you believe that a coup d'œil is ever a coup de grace?” “I have heard an old saying which may perhaps answer as well, Miss Holbrook—`un coup de langue est pire qu'un coup de lance.'” “I think some people have the habit of using both,” said Stephanie with a little vexed abandonment of her raillery. “Pray Mr. Collingwood are you of the family of Nelson's friend?” “I have heard various things said on the subject,” he said with a somewhat amused look. “Why don't you go to England and find out?” “To find out whether I am a gentleman?” said Mr. Rodney smiling. “I could not afford the time, Miss Holbrook, —I prefer to ascertain the fact here.” “But for aught you know you may be entitled to a coronet.” He answered with a smile and a slight shake of the head, as if many things might be “for aught he knew.” “If I had lived a few centuries ago, Miss Holbrook, my patent would have been clearly made out. At present Wolfgang is only a friend.” “Wolfgang?” said Kate looking up. “You know Miss Kate, a hound was one of the three animals that entitled their owner to the name of gentleman, or nobleman.” “No, I never knew that,—what were the other two?” “A hawk was one, and I believe a horse the other.” Stephanie went off to the window, and Mr. Rodney sat down by us. “What do you say to Mah-ta-to-pah, among savage heroes?” he said. “O I like him very much—but he was only an heroick savage,—when a man gets half way into civilization, the contrast strikes one,—I think he shews less well than in the all savage state. Unless he be such a man as Alfred, with light within that makes up for the darkness without.” “Yet Cæsar had great qualities.” “Yes, but I like or dislike people as a whole.” “Cannot admire the good and pass by the evil?” said Mr. Collingwood,—“are you looking for some Utopian corner of the earth, Miss Kate?” “No indeed—of course one must pass by some things; but when the prominent ones are disagreeable, I am inclined to pass by the person.” “What do you think of Napoleon? his most prominent qualities hardly deserve the epithet disagreeable—they were certainly wonderful.” “But they were the less important, Mr. Collingwood —who would care for head without heart?” said Kate quickly, and then looking down a little abashed at the smile which met her words. “You think heart more important than head?” “I think it can better stand alone.” “Then you do not call Napoleon a hero, Miss Kate?” “A man who would sacrifice the whole world to himself? Oh no!—the scales must turn the other way before he could even enter the lists as a hero.” “Hoity-toity!” said the Squire, “what are you talking about? Sacrifices, indeed!—fiddlesticks! Sacrifices don't pay, Miss Kate.” Kate laughed, but did not seem disposed to take up the cudgels. “Who have you been sacrificing yourself to?” said the Squire. “No one, sir—it is not my habit.” “Here comes Mr. Howard!” said Stephanie returning from the window as he entered. “I hope you have been eating macaroons, gentlemen?” was his first remark. “What for?” said the Squire. “I haven't thought of such a thing.” “It's not too late yet,” said my father, seizing the cake-basket. “There was a premium offered this morning for somebody to eat macaroons, and—but bless me! there isn't one here!” “The premium was taken up,” said Stephanie. “Absolutely eat 'em yourselves for want of somebody else to do it!” said Mr. Howard. “Well, then there is nothing worth offering but dinner. Squire Suydam and Mr. Collingwood will you please to sit down and wait patiently?” “Not I!” said the Squire,—“I must be going in two minutes.” “Why Mr. Suydam,” said Kate, “do you think it is right to treat your friends so?” “And do you Miss Kate, think it is right to leave a little old lady at home, all alone, and waiting for me?” “O if Mrs. Suydam is in the case,” said my stepmother, “we may not urge our claims. But you, Mr. Collingwood —cannot you disregard Mrs. Crown's turkey for once and eat part of ours?” He smiled. “No ma'am, not possibly—even if I had not already refused part of Miss Easy's.” “I shouldn't think they would cook anything but robins, down there,” observed Stephanie. “I'll tell you what, Miss,” said the Squire, taking hold of her ear and giving it a gentle pinch; “you want a lit-tle o-ver-hauling. Now Mr. Rodney, if you've looked long enough at these roses we'll betake ourselves to the snow-wreaths.” So they went and we sat down to dinner. “Why does one always enjoy everything more on such a day, papa?” said Kate—“even little things that at another time one would hardly notice.” “One does not always, my dear—sometimes one enjoys everything less,—that, I trust, you may never prove. But a young gay spirit on such a day, is like a snow-ball at play in its own element,—every turn adds something, and every something but furnishes new points to sparkle in the sunlight.” “That is not much like Mr. Freeman,” said Kate smiling. “But everybody seems to look better and brighter than they ever did before—even Squire Bulger.” “You know there are certain states of the weather,” replied Mr. Howard, “in which we say `nothing can help looking beautiful': so are there states of the spirits that form an embellishing medium for everything. The mind pleased and content with itself looks charitably at all the world. Put Squire Bulger in such a mental sunshine,” added my father smiling, “and it lights up even his brown wig. But when we look through tears we judge more truly,—it is only here and there an intrinsically fine scene or character that can abide the atmosphere of storms and clouds.” “Like Mr. Collingwood!” cried I. “I don't believe you ever looked at him through anything but clear air, Gracie,” said my father smiling. “However, I am not disposed to deny his radiance,—he is a star at home, certainly,—very different from that man in the Moon who shines only on his shoulders.” “I don't think you do Captain De Camp justice,” said Mrs. Howard: “they say he is the best son in the world, and his mother is as proud of him as possible.” “Is she? very likely,” said my father, “but I don't believe he'll ever set fire to anything; and as to his being the best son in the world, that I deny—a man cannot go beyond his qualifications. That Sulphur spring,” he continued, suddenly changing his tone, “is like to bring us and the world near enough together. They are putting up hotels and cottages and nobody knows what all, over there; and the Egertons have bought a place, and the Osbornes, and Mrs. Willet. It will make our own land more valuable, that's one thing.” “Not our old friend Mrs. Willet?” “The very same.” “Why that will be good fun,” said Kate,—“I should like to see them again. Will they be there next summer, papa?” “Probably not, for their houses are to build. But if you'll have patience my dear, you'll have neighbours enough.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. Sweet music went with us both all the wood through, The lark, linnet, throstle, and nightingale too; Winds over us whispered, flocks by us did bleat, And chirp went the grasshopper under our feet. Byrom. IT was easy to have patience in that beautiful winter weather,—easier still when the spring came with its new treasures. When one day we found the soft willow catkins, and another the yellow tresses of the black birch; and another the dainty little squirrel-cups that rose from their brown bed of leaves before Bunny himself was visible. When robins and sparrows and phœbes and catbirds, came like a winged fleet at the opening of navigation in some icebound river; and there were — “notes of joy from the hang-bird and wren, And the gossip of swallows through all the sky.” Who could lack patience to wait for anything that lay beyond?—surely none of spring's denizens. And such were we.—Our eyes saw no cloud, no ruffling of the stream of affairs,—could not even discern that increased swiftness of current which experience knows is near the fall. To three at Glen Luna all was absolutely lovely and placid; but those to whom Time had given the freedom of his great city of life, had their trials—hope disappointed and fears confirmed. Mr. Howard might say to himself “if I can have patience!” To take a little wisdom along with it never occurred to him, and improvements went on as fast as ever. Mill was finished, mill-dam in progress, fruit-walls were already decked with dwarfs and riders; and the rocks for the stone cottages were blasting, blasting, till our ears were tired. But—in short it was a bad honey season, and of course there was nothing to do but to make combs; and lest the workers should starve, the little swarm at home were very careful not to overeat themselves—figuratively speaking. Despite Mrs. Howard's fears the cattle had survived the winter,—how, Ezra Barrington best knew, and it was doubtless owing to his exceeding good care and management. But feed had not been always plenty nor easy to get, and Snowdrop's hide had certainly lost some of its marks of high living. Lady Bulger had roughed it better than the rest, being of a rougher nature to begin with; and now that grass was to be had for the cropping, all difficulty on that score was over. It was a difficulty which had hardly reached our apprehension. “Will anybody bear me company in a long walk?” said Mr. Rodney as he entered our sitting-room one April morning. “One body will,” said I. “And another,” said Kate. “Are you going up the hill difficulty—or discretion?” said Stephanie. “Because if it's the last, Mr. Collingwood, I never shall get to the top, so it's no use to try,—I may as well stay where I am, in the valley of `fits and starts'.” “Let one of the starts take you with us Miss Holbrook,” he answered smiling, “and I will promise to help you up every hill we come to.” “Don't attempt to help me up that one,” said Stephanie, “for I tell you it's no use. If you dragged me up, I should roll right down again—the first thing I did,—if I didn't take a wilful start and run.” “I have no opinion of dragging, up any hill,” he replied; and we went to get ready. “Are you going to the Brown bluff, Mr. Collingwood?” I said. “No, not this morning,—unless some of you wish it.” “I don't—I like a new walk better. O you should have seen the flag I had up there last summer!” “I did!” said he with a smile, “and thought of Purrer-purrer immediately.” “Purrer-purrer! what could make you think of her? I'm sure my white flag didn't look much like pussy.” 5* “Not much,—but extremely like pussy's mistress.” “So I thought,” said Kate. “It went about as straight to my heart, Gracie, as if I had been eyeing you through a telescope,—or had caught some shadow or reflection of the little figure that was out of sight.” “Mr. Collingwood,” said Stephanie, “do you know everything?” “Not quite,” said he smiling,—“I am in no danger of leading an idle life for want of something to learn.” “But don't you know most things that other people don't know?” “I am not very well acquainted with other people's acquirements.” “Look here,” said Stephanie, “you're dragging me up the patient hill at present, and in the most roundabout way that can be. Won't you just give me a plain answer? —didn't you ever study strange out of the way things?” “Sometimes—a few,”—said Mr. Collingwood with a rather comical play of the mouth. “What do you want to know, Miss Stephanie?—I'm sure that is straightforward.” “I want to know why that white flag looked like this young one,—for it certainly did, even to my unsentimental eyes.” “Unsentimental—yes, none other could see it. Sentimental eyes look rather at the effect of matter upon mind than of mind upon matter.” “I confess that my eyes look into obscurity at present,” said Stephanie. “To come into daylight then—I think that every work not purely mechanical bears the stamp of the author's character. A very country-seat will shew whether ignorance or education be at the head of it,—whether its owner have cultivation and refinement as well as taste.” “Do you think they can be separated?” said Kate. “Not if you take the word taste in its true sense. There is a sort, current in the world, which sometimes knows strange associates; and many persons have a key to the streams of beauty, who can by no means unlock the secrets of the fountain-head.” “But Grace and the flag—I was not talking of country-seats,” said Stephanie. “I said every work,—there was so much of Miss Grace's character in the flag, that it was not very hard to imagine it a personification of her own little self.” “In other words to make a dissolving view—Vanish the flag into thin air, leaving Grace on the top of a pine-tree! —If I had followed out that train of reasoning in the stagecoach, I should have been desperately uncomfortable!” “You are disposed of now, Miss Gracie,” said Mr. Collingwood laughing. “But I think you are all wrong,” I said,—“the flag made me think of Kate, so it must have looked like her. You didn't see straight, Mr. Collingwood.” “Maybe I did,” he answered with a smile. “After all,” said Stephanie, “Grace didn't put up the flag —we ought to have seen Andy.” “No indeed!” said Kate,—“the plan is the work, to all intents and purposes.” “To all intents, if you please,” said Stephanie,—“I demur to the purposes. Instance Squire Bulger's saw-mill yonder—built over a stream that didn't exist. Looks like him, doesn't it, Mr. Collingwood?” “I think you would make a difficult pupil, Miss Holbrook. I should need to study one or two more out of the way things if I had to give you lessons.” Thus talking and discussing, we had followed a winding foot-path to the very top of what was called the Green hill —from the crops of winter grain which there shewed their beauty. The owner never planted it with anything else, except where a short alternation became absolutely necessary; and in the spring Green hill was the prettiest sight that could be. A small clump of hickories grew near the top, and there we sat us down to rest and look about. We were to the north-east of our own Glen, which lay full in sight; as did also the Bird's Nest, shadowed by its great tree. The lake lay beyond, visible from horn to horn, and gleaming in the soft spring sun; and on the further gently sloping shore the white houses at the Moon shone clean and bright, as if their spring confusion were already over. Between us and the level ground there was nothing but winter grain,—some three inches high now, and covering the swells and hollows with a surpassing verdure that was more or less bright in places, as the spears bent before the breeze or stood breathlessly waiting its approach. There was not a sound, there was not a stir, except in nature's pure kingdom,—the faint “haw!” to some distant team seemed hardly to belong to any other; and now and then a bird in the tree-top above us “Shook out of his little throat floods of delirious music—” as Longfellow has it. Far to the west stood the little brown church; and somewhat nearer, a faint touch of blue against the budding trees told of the Lea fireside. There Mr. Rodney's eyes were fixed,—fixed with such thoughtful, grave expression, that no one cared to interrupt his musings. And the phœbes called to each other, and the song sparrows uttered their joyous allegro; and breeze and sun and song seemed to pass on like a flood—ever varying, ever the same,—a kind of mingled sweetness for which the mind had no prism. On all sides of us a well-cultivated country stretched away to the blue distance. Long rolls of grass and stubble and ploughed fields, with here and there a patch of dark forest, or the white spot of some farmhouse and the sanguinary hue of its barn. Often both buildings were of the same uniform no-paint colour, and hardly discernible in the distance. There was little rough ground to be seen, and what appeared so by contrast, would hardly have deserved the name in a ruder region. A few heights of “sterner stuff” than their neighbours were left to choose and enjoy their own tenants,—stones, and wild plants, and trees that disdained cultivation and shewed the want of it; while their tumbling brooks felt the power of influence when they reached the lower grounds, and flowed gently and with fertilizing leisure. These rude spots were but few. Farms and farm-houses, mills, water-courses, rail fences, a stone wall or two, and a mere sprinkling of pleasure grounds, made up the landscape. In the extreme south a short line of blue pyramids checked the soft cultivation, and told us that such was not all the world. “Mr. Collingwood,” said I, as his look came back to the things near him, “did you ever read `Evenings at Home'?” “I believe I have, Miss Gracie. How should daylight out of doors make you think of evenings at home?” “Those blue mountains, you know—they're like those the squirrel wanted to get to.” “I don't think the squirrel was so far wrong after all,” said Kate—“seeing he didn't know any better,—blue mountains are some of the most attractive things in the world.” “Why?” said Mr. Collingwood. “They look so pure and peaceful—so resting,—as if rough winds could not blow there,—as if there one could never be weary.” “It is but earth still,” he answered, “and a fair type of earth's power to satisfy; so inviting in the distance, so cold when reached. Many a one has proved the squirrel's experience. The only land `Where tempests never beat nor billows roar,' lies out of sight; and concerning it there have been no more striking words written than those few, `I shall be satisfied!'” He spoke with a grave realization that seemed an echo from the very land he referred to. “But it's so pleasant to take a bright view of things!” said Stephanie breaking through a silence she had no liking for. “So pleasant that I would seek for the brightest.—If my words bear any gloomy construction, Miss Holbrook, I expressed myself ill.” “But Mr. Collingwood,” said Kate rather timidly, “do you think aerial perspective is meant to serve no purpose? that one ought to disregard its effect as much as possible?” “By no means—either in the physical or mental world. It would be a sorrowful thing if all the chequer work of life were as distinct at a distance as near by. And yet Miss Kate it is good sometimes to look through a telescope,— good always to approach hope's blue mountains with a mind braced for possibilities. No joy was ever less sweet for a moderated expectation.” “I don't believe in your telescopic view,” said Stephanie. “Why shouldn't I think that little brown speck to be a hermitage instead of a hut?” “And that huts and misery do not exist?” “In my neighbourhood—they may be somewhere in the world, of course.” “Why shouldn't a physician try to think all his patients in perfect health?” “Fiddle-de-dee! they're in his charge, and have called for his help.” “And did you never hear an appeal from a mere outside of wretchedness? Ah Miss Stephanie—that will not do! I wish I had a spy-glass to give you a nearer view of that same brown speck. You would think it spoke pretty plainly.” “I wish you hadn't! Don't it make you sad to go to such places?” “Yes.” “Then why should one go?—I don't like to feel sad. Now the physician knows he can do something.” “I beg your pardon—he only knows that he can try,— whether he shall succeed or not is a matter quite out of his hands. Miss Kate, will you not give us the result of this long meditation?” “I was thinking that one does not always know how to try.” Mr. Collingwood smiled. “But one can always use those powerful simples, encouragement and sympathy,—and Miss Kate,” he added gently, “one ought to know how to apply the catholicon.” “Yes, that is very true.” “They are such dreadful places to go to!” said Stephanie,— “I don't suppose one in fifty keeps a broom, and even the farmhouses are curious enough.” “I have always thought,” said Mr. Collingwood, “that there is nothing more beautiful about the sunlight, than its seeking the darkest places and giving at least a passing notice to all that is most shunned and despised. And nobody ever thought that those pure rays compromised their dignity.” “But after all,” said Stephanie with a mixture of seriousness and mischievous insinuation, “there isn't apt to be more than one sun in a neighbourhood.” Mr. Collingwood coloured a little, but then lightly answered her according to the letter. “If you charge me with being fanciful, I must fall back upon George Herbert. He says, `Shine like the sun in every corner.'” “He is fanciful—I don't like him.” “I do,” said Kate. “But Mr. Collingwood, the sun has a power of going about which very much assists his benevolence.” “I know that very well,” said he smiling, “but remember too, Miss Kate, the sun is felt where he cannot be seen.” “Does your telescope say that is water or mud down yonder?” said Stephanie as we began to descend the hill. “Mud—decidedly.” “Are there no springs hereabouts?” “There is one not far off,” he answered somewhat comically; “but unluckily it is in a garden, and the garden surrounds a house—painted red! and the front door has a horizontal division.” “How absurd you are!” said Stephanie while Kate and I laughed. “Is it a hut?” “No—a farmhouse.” “That is bad. I could go to a hut for water, but these farmhouse people would pull us in and put us in rocking-chairs.” “And the consequences, Miss Stephanie?” “The consequences would be that we should have to sit and talk to them.” Mr. Collingwood stood with folded arms as if awaiting further information. “Don't you see!” said Stephanie—“they would take it as a visit.” “And perhaps come and see us in turn,” said Kate. Mr. Collingwood laughed and walked on. “You are quite beyond me now!” he said. “I thought I could answer all your objections, but I am out of my depth. However if you will wait for me at a safe distance, I will bring you some water—I think I can be trusted with a tumbler; for unfortunately,” he added with a smile that was keen as well as bright, “I have some acquaintance with the family.” “We do not need it in the least,” Kate said,—“you need not take the trouble—we can wait till we get home.” “It is no trouble Miss Kate—you will be quite safe if you stand here. There is very little passing on this road, and I shall be back in a moment.” He went before we could hinder it, and we stood rather thoughtfully eyeing the dell and the red house and Mr. Rodney and the divided front door—which had certainly opened to admit him with all the unanimity of good will. It was but a moment as he said before he brought us a pitcher of the brightest and coldest water, and glasses which, if not cut, were admirably clean. They were scarce filled before a messenger came running from the hut. A little girl—with a very pretty face, bare feet, and toilet arrangements that spoke an abundance of out-door play. “Mr. Rodney,” she said in a shy half whisper, and looking at us between words, “Granny said to tell the ladies if they'd drink some milk, I'd fetch it to 'em right away.” “Why don't you ask the ladies themselves, Susie?” The child looked up at Kate, but did not open her lips except to smile; and the answer she got was so very smiling and pleasant, that her next question was somewhat startling—though spoken low as at first. “Mr. Rodney who is the pretty lady?” Stephanie took her tumbler from her lips and laughed, while Kate reversed that action and blushed; and Mr. Collingwood with perfect gravity gave our names in the order of seniority. “I should like to kiss her, so much!” said the child folding her hands together. “You may kiss me, Susie,” said Mr. Collingwood quickly,—“will not that do as well? Or, if you like it better, I will kiss you.” But Susie did not choose to wait for that, and after a little twisting of herself about she turned round and scampered back to the house, while Mr. Collingwood followed more leisurely with the borrowed articles; and then we presently resumed our walk. “Do farmhouse children usually exhibit such discernment?” said Stephanie with the delight of annoying one of her companions and the hope of annoying two. But that failed. “As what, Miss Stephanie?” “As this little rustic we have just seen.” “And as how exhibited?” “Why did you interfere to hinder the child's wish?” said Miss Holbrook abruptly. “I trust my interference was not unwarrantable nor ill-timed. I am sure Miss Kate forgave me.” “Only half,”—said Kate, looking up as if she meant to have her question answered,—“it was not more than half out of good nature to me, Mr. Collingwood?” “Yes, rather more,” he said with a smile. “Weren't you afraid I would refuse, and so hurt the child's feelings?” “A little.”— We had paused upon a rising ground to look back, and the farmhouse dell showed very fairly in the distance; but now we saw a figure approaching the door whom we all recognized at once,—indeed as Kate said afterwards, “it could be nobody but Miss Easy.” Mr. Rodney said nothing, he neither called our attention to the lady nor told us who it was; but as she reached the door and went in, among the little troop that had rushed out to meet her, his eye wore a look of singular brightness and pleasure; and so much of the glow remained when we turned again to our walk, that Stephanie lost patience. “Then you would absolutely encourage uppishness!” she said. “Well I wouldn't!” “Nor I,—and therefore”— he stopped short. “You may just as well go on—`and therefore you wouldn't practise it.'—You are mistaken for once in your life.” “Don't you think such people are apt to presume, Mr. Collingwood?” said Kate. “Very apt if you give them a chance. But if we meet the poor now and then on their own ground, they will care the less about attaining to ours. It is this nervous guarding of position which makes them feel looked down upon; and then naturally they try for a stand where that shall seem less possible. The silk slipper never hurt itself by a step off the dais.” “Not even into the mud?” “If people cannot keep out of the mud,” said Mr. Collingwood laughing, “they had better put on hob-nailed shoes at once, and keep off the dais. Why Miss Stephanie I have seen a delicate slipper pass through city streets as if they were carpeted!” “Then on the whole you like farmhouses?” “On the whole I prefer large mirrors if any, and ungarnished with asparagus—also I confess to a predilection for other than rag-carpets.” And then as he bade us good-morning Mr. Rodney said with a smile, “You do not like George Herbert—will you quarrel with Shakespeare or with me, if I remind you of Portia's `little candle'?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I have done; for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I have in my whole five. Shakspeare. “PERHAPS you remember, Kate,” said Stephanie one morning, “that very wise and sententious remark that your father made the other day about the properties of man?” “`The chief properties of man are contemplation and sociableness'? that was only a quotation from More, I think he said.” “Only!—well, since Mr. Howard quoted it, I suppose I may venture to refer to it. It struck me as particularly wise,—for I have been thinking that man, and of course woman, was made up of only one. Now don't you suppose that standing too much upon one foot may have a tendency to weaken the other?” “Do you think of trying contemplation?” said Kate, without looking up from her book,—“yes, I should think it quite probable.” “I wish to goodness you might fall into somebody's hands who would give you an overdose of contemplation for once!” said Stephanie. “Overdoses never kill,” said Kate smiling,—“I should come out a hermit.” “My dear, you are that already—only you don't know it,—the life you lead here at present by no means savours of dissipation.” “I doubt if my life would, anywhere,” said Kate. “Might savour of it, you know—just a soupçon,—as people put a grain of sugar in gruel.” “I never do,” said Kate,—“a grain of salt is to my liking; and no one ever found that in dissipation.” “I declare,” said Stephanie, “if you will not attend to my words, I will pelt you with quotations.” “Where from?” “Don't know, in the least—but you will as soon as I tell them to you. How do you like this. `The eagle flies alone, it is only the sheep that like company.' Are you going to make an eagle of yourself? one of the `select few'? for I'm sure my quotation should be in the plural— eagles do occasionally like company.” “You are altogether too profound for my light reading,” said Kate, shutting her book. “What is all this about? I thought you had been turning pirouettes on both feet, all your life.” “It is all about my going to pay Mrs. Eustace a visit.” “What put such a thing into your head?” “This letter of request that I would come; and my mind being an easy one to make up, I shall spend all my energies upon my trunk, and depart to-morrow morning with your father.” To say was to do, and she went. We were particularly quiet after that, for Mr. Howard began to be a good deal away,—property elsewhere demanded his attention, and Glen Luna had to wait its turn. Yet even this repeated absence had a bright side— the coming back; and then, besides the pleasure of seeing him and hearing of the people and things he had seen, there was always some interest about my father's trunk. The Moon shops were but so-so, and those at Wiamee still worse; so we always sent elsewhere when we could; and Mr. Howard brought home things in every variety. The long journey or the trunk gave them a peculiar charm. Never were there such spools of cotton—never were the various little articles of family use so well appreciated; and often there came too a surprise,—a new book, a work-box, or a gold pen. Whenever Mr. Howard staid at home for a few days, the improvements went on in double quick time; for as Ezra Barrington remarked, “he made the men fly round like shell peas.” We thought some of the improvements, might have had another name, and felt it hard to spare fine branches because by and by the tree would be the handsomer. Indeed we always took that promise with a doubt, and other innovations that were confessedly for use met with still less favour. A wall must cut us off in that direction because the cattle got into the garden; and this road must be changed from its pretty winding curves to a direct line, because a short cut to the barn seemed desirable. But whenever I went that way, I quitted the new gravel for the old crooks, which the grass was lending a hand to obliterate, and followed them pertinaciously. Everybody laughed at me for it, but my feet were discontented else. One day when we were roaming the fields, and admiring the white promise of wild strawberries, we came to a little hollow that had last year been very liberal. The march of improvement had set its foot even there. Ezra Barrington with cart and oxen was dumping gravel into the very hollow; and the amount of white blossoms that tried to shake their heads clear at the outskirts of the heap, gave a fair indication of the fruitless efforts that lay beneath its centre. My father stood complacently looking on. “Why papa!” exclaimed Kate—“you are filling up my beautiful strawberry patch!” “Must be filled up, my dear,—don't you see it is just in the course of this road?” “But why can't the road go round it?” said I. “That would hardly do,—it would be inconvenient, and wouldn't look well besides.” “I think it would look better than this.” “Ge' 'long!” said Mr. Barrington, in a very audible aside to his team. “Come about! haw!—You want it right straight across, Squire?—maybe another load'll fill it up sufficient if you don't mind it's being a bit wavy. Otherways it'll take three.” “Straight across!” said my father—“there's gravel enough. I don't care if it takes a dozen.” “There aren't strawberries enough,” said Kate.—“Papa it is rather too bad!” “Nonsense!” said my father, “we shall have berries in the garden next summer,—and if we didn't the road is of much more importance.” “Nobody likes to eat them better than you do, papa!” “Well I will curb my appetite for once,” said Mr. Howard laughing. The subject of country neighbours was not quite laid asleep, for in spite of Kate and Stephanie's precautions we were exposed to a visit now and then which did not please them,—sometimes dictated by curiosity, sometimes by policy. If the family of the country doctor had failed in attention, there would have been danger of our being sick under nobody knows what auspices; and the same might be said of our quarrels had the attorney been remiss; —while the proprietor of the only mill in the neighbourhood probably thought that as we were putting up another there could be no reason why we should not be well acquainted. Mrs. Howard bore it all with her usual gentleness towards human nature in whatever form; but Kate found it very annoying, and would fain have made the visits begin and end at the front door. This my father negatived with his usual coolness. Everybody might come that wanted to he said, and get all the good that eyes could take in;—as for being “engaged” to one person and not to another—merely because the one was poor and the other rich—he had no idea of it,—“he knew what was due to ourselves.” To do him justice he never put himself out of the way for anybody, in the least. If he didn't want to stay in the drawing-room he walked off into the study; and when he did stay it was to be silent as often as to talk. But listeners are always popular, and my father was soon voted the pink of politeness,—either physician or attorney would have attended him with pleasure. July was well on its way before Stephanie returned; and then she came tired, grave, and rather silent,—a most unusual combination for Miss Holbrook. Sleep exerted its restorative powers but partially; for though she talked fast enough all breakfast time, afterwards, when we took our work into the room where she was unpacking, Stephanie seemed to plunge as deep into the recesses of her mind as of her trunks,—and brought forth much less. “What are you thinking about?” Kate said at length. “I was reflecting upon the amount of things that a visit may do and undo—just look at this dress! who would suppose it had ever been fit to put on!” “Why anybody that knew anything about dresses and wearing them. But what has the visit done? this is just the undoing.” But Stephanie only made another plunge. “It must be yourself!” said Kate laughing—“I never saw you in such good order before,—you have excessively the air of having just come from the ruffle woman. I didn't know that Mrs. Eustace made such liberal use of starch and fluting-irons.” “If it's all the same to you,” said Stephanie with something of her own manner, “I'd as leave not be exasperated.” “I would exasperate you in a minute,” said Kate still laughing, “if I only knew how—at present I have not the slightest idea who you are. Just look out of the window and say that you feel at home or I shall conclude you are somebody else.” “Wilder conclusions than that have come true, and my eyes have at present full occupation.” “But Stephanie,” I said, “it is so lovely out,—it's a shame not to look at such flowers and sunshine,—we think everything is prettier than it ever was.” “Very likely”—said Stephanie,—“I can answer for Kate;—but Grace my dear, I do not wish to have my fancy entangled among flowers and sunshine.” “Why not?” “Because I have made up my mind to run a race with a snow-ball—and in those latitudes you know, such things don't flourish.” “I wonder which foot you are on now?” said Kate. “Why do you talk such nonsense?” “Truth must be spoken, if it is nonsense.” “Do separate them,” said Kate a little impatiently, “and give us the short cut of this rigmarole. What are you talking about?” “Short cut?” said Stephanie—“it's a hard knot, or like to be; and as to talking—I was alluding with sufficient distinctness to a person I thought you might remember.” And locking the empty trunk, Miss Holbrook pushed it from her and opened a full one. Kate laid down her work. “I never saw you serious in my life, so it's no wonder if I am puzzled. You don't mean that you intend to marry Mr. Freeman.” “Precisely—if you like that name better,—I prefer his appellation of Snowball.” “How can you be so absurd!” said Kate, laughing in spite of herself at the cool demureness of the reply. “My gracious me!” said Stephanie as with an emphatic fling of a pair of shoes into the corner, she crossed her arms and looked up at us, “you're enough to try more patience than I've got! Here am I making revelations that ought to be à la rouge I suppose, and you won't believe them. Don't I tell you I'm going to marry that man? Was nobody ever married before?” “But not to Mr. Freeman,” said Kate—with a most innocent rendering of her thoughts into plain English. “Not to Mr. Freeman!—Probably not—your pieces of information are startling. I suppose there must be a first time—even for Mr. Freeman. You see the `thtarths' have melted him, as Henderson says.” “But what has melted you?” said Kate. “I don't profess to be an iceberg,” said Stephanie dryly and turning to her trunk. Then changing her tone she added, “And it isn't desirable you know that we should both be of `the melting mood', or we might run away together. Now don't look so horrified either of you. Kate—do you perceive how completely unstarched I am?” Kate smiled a little but with a rather grave face, and went on taking stitches in the most abstracted manner; while Stephanie as half in argument with her silence continued. “What is it to any one if I like snow-balls? I don't say they're as striking as epaulettes, or as aspiring as eagles. And by the way, how is his falconship?” “I didn't know eagles were falcons,” said I. “Belong to the Falconidæ, don't they? or I've forgotten all about ornithology. But you know, Kate, I never was strong-winged enough to `follow such a flight,'—that is reserved for—somebody else. Better eyes than mine must exert their powers, when the object is some miles above earth. Don't puzzle your head Gracie.” “Well,” said Kate, “as I do not know Mr. Freeman I cannot congratulate you.” “And knowing me you cannot congratulate him—I'll forgive you all that if you'll do something else. Katydid —just be Katydo for once, and tell Mr. Howard what I have told you. I really cannot tell him myself, for he'd certainly pour out some of the prophecies he used to make about the poor Captain; and I'm afraid I should pass all bounds of decorum if he told me my snow-ball would “never set fire to anything.” “O Stephanie!” Kate said—then checking herself she folded up her work, and sticking the needle in it with unusual care, remarked, “I will do all you wish me to.” “That was not what you were going to say?” “No.” “Tell me that.” “It's better unsaid.—Is there anything else for me to tell papa?” “Nothing,—only make him understand all this clearly, so that he won't come down upon me with any questions,— my self-possession extends but to ordinary occasions. And now Kate,” she said springing off the floor and laying her hands on Kate's shoulders, “I know every word you were going to say, and you are altogether right and partly wrong, —which is a charming combination. There, now go, both of you, and let me finish this job without the distraction of your eyelashes—which make me feel melancholy. Preliminary `tears and white muslin' are more than I bargained for.” When Kate and I had talked over this strange conversation with a mingling of sorrow and wonder, we went into Mrs. Howard's room and gave her the benefit of it. My father's comments were deferred for a day or two as he was from home. “Papa,” Kate began the next morning after his return, “do you know that Stephanie is going to be married?” 6 “No I don't,” he replied, facing round upon Kate as if he wondered how the subject got into her head. “Then I have the pleasure of informing you,” said Kate with a laugh at the gravity with which she was eyed. “I have not the pleasure of hearing,” said Mr. Howard knitting his brows. “But you must hear and be pleased too, papa.” “With what?” “Why—with this news I am telling you.” “Humph—” said my father. “Who set that ball a rolling?” “Mr. Freeman in the first place, I suppose, papa.” My father looked at the demure eyes that met his, as if he would like to find fault with something,—he couldn't with them. “Freeman!” he said turning round to his former position. “Marry that man! no indeed she shall not.” “Why Mr. Howard!” said my stepmother, “what can you possibly mean?” “Just that,” said my father coolly. “But you have no right to say so,—and it wouldn't do any good besides.” “What can you possibly mean now? No right, and I her guardian! No good to forbid her marrying a man with more inches than ideas!” “No good at all—for she'd marry him when she came of age or run away before. And as to the right, as your friend the Chancellor used to say `you may have it in law but not in equity,'—if she really likes the man and he is unobjectionable.” “I tell you he isn't unobjectionable. I never heard any harm of him, but he's a nonentity.” “That is only a negative objection,” said my stepmother smiling. “My objections are positive enough,” said my father. “Now my dear Mr. Howard, do be reasonable. Make inquiries about Mr. Freeman, and if he is good and respectable and has enough to live upon, let them please themselves,—you can't bring everybody to the same standard of sense and enjoyment.” “I wish everybody was brought to your standard of sense, my dear. Well—But whom shall I ask? I don't even know where the man lives,—and I'm sure it is not my fault if we have any mutual friends.” “Go over to the Moon and see Captain De Camp,” said Mrs. Howard. “Yes I suppose I may as well go to the Moon as anywhere. But De Camp—he hasn't got another furlough has he?” “O yes papa,” said I,—“he has been here twice.” “The deuce he has!—I am well set to work, certainly.” “But papa!” exclaimed Kate as he reached the door, “you mustn't tell Captain De Camp why you want to know about Mr. Freeman,—you must be very careful.” “I shall say first that Stephanie's going to marry him,— after which I shall inquire if he is a respectable man. Do you think I am a fool, Kate?” “No papa, but”— “Well my dear, if I can't deal with Captain De Camp it's a pity. You needn't wait dinner for me—I shall stop at the Bird's Nest.” “But stay,” said Mrs. Howard—“you must find out where Mr. Freeman is, as well as who he is,—he may be staying at the Moon again, and then you must call upon him and invite him over here.” My father stopped and stood irresolute. “No doubt he is there!—it's the rallying point for all the satellites of this region. I wish he was in Egypt!” There was such a mixture of the undecided, the ludicrous, and the dismayed in my father's face, that we all burst out laughing. “Take care or that child will hear you,” he said. “She has gone out,” said my stepmother. “But why does this annoy you so? If it were Kate, indeed”— “Kate!” interrupted my father,—and as if words could no further go, he quitted the room and left us to laugh at our leisure. The afternoon was just ending when Mr. Howard returned. “Well!” he said as he sat down, “I ought to have come back luminous after such a sojourn in that precious planet!” “Did you see Miss Caffery, papa?” said I. “Good Miss Caffery!” said my father, his face unbending, “she half persuaded me out of my ill-humour,—half convinced me that if people could be happy without anything to make them so, it was none of my business.” “And what said Miss Bain?” inquired my stepmother. “Miss Bain said that the very best thing young people could do—at least,” said my father checking himself, “she said sundry foolish things which I need not repeat. Do we have any tea to-night?—or are we to live upon laughing?” “But papa,” said Kate composing her face, “you haven't told us about Mr. Freeman?” “What about Mr. Freeman?” “Why all about him,—what you have heard and seen. Stephanie will come down when the tea-bell rings, and then you will have no chance.” “Well,” said Mr. Howard again and reseating himself, “I went to the Moon and I saw Captain De Camp—and Mr. Freeman—of course. And Mr. Freeman had the sense (which I didn't expect) to take himself off. I reckon he was afraid of me. And the Captain was unusually lucid in his answers. So I learned without much difficulty that Mr. Freeman has survived a precocious childhood; that he rests his knowledge of the State's prison solely on information and belief; that roguery and riches are in the future tense with him; and that to hinder as much as possible his pursuit after both, `he has fallen desperately in love with Miss Holbrook—quite head and ears, I assure you sir.' If I could imitate the concluding laugh, my dear, you would have a fair presentation of the whole. Kate and Grace what are you laughing at?” “Only at the presentation, papa. And what did you say?” “I? O I said, `Ah indeed!'—and `you are sure sir?'— and finally rushed about after the man himself to tell him of my joy that he was not an escaped convict, and to ask him here to dinner to-morrow.” “And he will come?” “Come!—he would have followed me home to-night if I hadn't looked rather cross, I believe,” said my father. “But you must not look cross,” said my stepmother. “Think of that poor child upstairs, and don't take the edge off her happiness.” “Tut! my dear—if the sight of Mr. Freeman don't take the edge off it's quite out of my reach. But poor child! as you say; and she's a good child too; and I love her for her father's sake as well as her own.” So he did. No remark that was even doubtful in its bearing was suffered to reach Stephanie's ear; and there was a kindness in his tone that brought tears to her eyes, when he said, “Well Stephanie my dear, your old friend Mr. Freeman dines with us to-morrow, so I hope you will make yourself very agreeable. And by the way,” he added, “I told the two ladies that we should be glad of their company.” “That is just what we were wishing!” said Kate and I together. It so happened that Caddie Mc In—the only specimen of womankind who then inhabited our kitchen—knew about as much of the mysteries of flour and spice, as she did of botany and Epicurus. Therefore on that eventful morning, which, as Stephanie expressed it, “would bring a coolness among the members of our family,” Kate and I rolled up our sleeves and “went but,” as the Scotch say; for we had declared that Stephanie should play visiter, and see neither Charlotte nor Soufflé till they were on the table. I was busily engaged before the kitchen window, introducing ladies' fingers to the most intimate acquaintance with the Charlotte mould; and Kate in the shade of the wall sat quietly mixing an odoriferous compound; when a quick, frosty step made me look up,—and there, just before my open window, stood Squire Brown. Since our first coming to Glen Luna the Browns had sent frequent messages that they meant to call upon us, but themselves never came,—this was the first time a Brown foot had approached our house. The present apparition was a little old man—or he would have been old if he hadn't been jolly—whose roll-about body sat rather insecurely upon his little roll-about legs; whose coat was snuff-colour, and his trousers a compromise between pantaloons and small-clothes. His hat was broad-brimmed, a whip flourished in one hand, and his little sharp eyes were endeavouring to see from the bright open air into our kitchen—of course dark by contrast. Perhaps an occasional waft of maraschino may have quickened these efforts. “Ah, my dear!” said the Squire, “how d'ye do?—busy, eh?”—here he gave himself a little twist and peered more anxiously than ever,—“how's your father? well, eh? and the rest of you?” “Quite well sir, I thank you.” “Well my dear,” with a turn of the head that convinced me he knew where Kate sat and was trying to see her; “well my dear, has your father got through haying?” “O yes sir, long ago.” “Long ago! eh,—well that's good. D'ye think now— you're his data ain't you?” “Yes sir.” “D'ye think your father could let me have Mr. Barrington for a couple of days? I've got a field of grass down and my man's taken sick.” “I don't know sir, I'll tell him when he comes home.” “He's out, is he?” “Yes sir.” “D'ye know where he's gone my dear, eh?” “To Mr. Collingwood's I believe, sir.” “Farmer Collingwood's—that's out of my way,” said the Squire, again nearly oversetting my gravity and his own,— “fine young man his son is, ain't he? Well my dear you'll tell him—d'ye know my name now, eh?” “I believe so, sir.” “Yes I guess so too—and harkye, my datas have been coming down here this long time, only it's so far you see, they haven't made it out;—but they'll come very soon. Good-day my dear.” How we laughed! “He didn't see you Kate, after all!” “No; but I wonder what he means by `so far,'—I'm sure they go often enough to the Moon, which is much further.” “If they're like him we needn't care,” said I,—“did you hear him say `datas'?” “I suspect they are modernized copies,” said Kate: “at least according to Mrs. De Camp. I wonder papa did not ask them here to-day,—it would have been only polite.” “He did: I heard him telling mamma this morning.” “Then I haven't made enough soufflé said Kate despairingly. “O they're not coming to dinner—only to tea and ice-cream.” “Ice-cream?” said Stephanie—“that sounds pleasant. Do I look quite fiery?” she added advancing into the kitchen. We both turned and looked at her. Pretty, very pretty she always was, and that day especially. Excitement had given even neck and arms a slight reflection of her pink dress, but the prevailing tint was kept down by her gracefully arranged black hair; while in her eyes the expression—half dance half defiance—which usually shone there, was softened by other feelings—the new and the timid. I even fancied that her eyelashes were wet, and that tears lay hid behind them as she returned our earnest gaze. “Well Katie, well Gracie,” she said at last, “what are you thinking of?” I saw the sigh that might not be heard, as Kate answered, “I was thinking of you dear,—how nice you look!” “Nice!—And not fiery?” “Not a bit.” “And do you say so too, Gracie?” “I don't know—I was thinking your neighbourhood might be pleasant to—to anything very cold,” said I inexplicitly. Stephanie laughed, and saying “she wasn't wanted in the kitchen, then,” she left us.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. The Doctor now obeys the summons, Likes both his company and commons; Displays his talents, sits till ten; Next day invited, comes again. Cowper. (Horace.) WELL might my father say “Good Miss Caffery!”—our hearts echoed it many times in the course of that afternoon. The mere sight of her would have soothed most people; and her white dress, so delicately ruffled, was enough to unruffle every one else. Her tone of voice too was so pleasant, so feelingly gentle, that one was touched as well as interested by what she said. Every word and look spoke the eminent humanity of her nature, but said as plainly that it was humanity purified. I never saw her now without thinking of Mr. Collingwood's words, “a lovely and well-developed christian character,”—they helped me to understand what before I had only felt. It was like being shown the secret spring whence came some indefinable freshness of the atmosphere. I do not mean that we were all out of humour on that eventful day, but there was some embarrassment or anxiety with each one—now and then with my father a little moodiness. But Miss Easy seemed to smooth away everything,—no one could be in such a ray without for the time at least, assuming its colour. Miss Avarintha was as usual peculiar: very unwilling that things should go on quietly, and not having the least idea how to put her finger in with judgment. Mrs. De Camp was full of talk; the Captain very bland and benign; and Mr. Freeman (when he thought my father was thinking of some one else) very happy and comfortable. He sat basking in the light of Stephanie's pink dress, far beyond all disturbance from trifles; but Miss Holbrook herself was well disposed to give the aforesaid finger a rap over the knuckles every time she encountered it; and if she sometimes forbore in deference to Kate's look of reproof, it was only to utter an energetic aside about “the Bain of her life.” In the evening when my father and I were walking about and joining everybody by turns for the sake of variety, Mr. Collingwood came in; and like us took a promenade ticket. Miss Bain had just crossed the room to make an attack. “Where do you reside now sir?” she began. “At least I don't mean now—of course you are at the Moon and likely there to continue, I suppose, for some time—but where have you been residing?” “Really ma'am,” said Mr. Freeman returning from the antipodes, “I can hardly say,—I did live in New York until the last six months.” “And since then?” “Since then,” he replied, laughing partly at his questioner and partly at what he was going to say,—“Since then ma'am, my head has been in the condition of a family in moving time—the house in one place and the furniture in another,—of course my existence has been somewhat compounded and intermediate.” “`Who of all the world should meet One summer's day, but Love and Reason,' said my father with a smile. “That moving state, Mr. Freeman, always brings two evils,—the house wants settling and the furniture wants mending.” “I wish no delay about either, sir,” said Mr. Freeman with great frankness. “But Mr. Howard,” said Miss Bain insinuatingly, “that is a lady's province,—you would not expect a gentleman to undertake it.” “My expectations are but limited, ma'am, from either man or woman.” “What a singular idea!” said Miss Bain. “You will find it a very plural idea,” said my father. 6* “Mr. Freeman—I can't ask you of course. What do you say, Mr. Rodney?” “Not quite that, sir.” “See there now, what it is to want experience!” said my father, “where's the use of expecting uncertainties?” “Isn't there an expectation of hope?” “And a disappointment of hope too, I'm thinking. You'll come out of that delusion my good sir, unless your charitable eye-glass gains all the magnifying power that your mental eye will lose.” “And what is to hinder?” said Mr. Rodney smiling,— “why shouldn't it, Mr. Howard? Charity is not so much needed till delusion fails.” “I'm sure I can't tell why it shouldn't—I don't know how it is with you, but there's a considerable degree of perverseness that will always hinder it in me.” “Grains of allowance, sir,” said Miss Bain, picking up an end of the subject. “And a little soil for them to grow in. I've thrown out plenty of `grains of allowance' that came to nothing,—so you see my stock has decreased. I don't mean to expect anything from anybody in future.” “Except from that one person in the window?” said Miss Easy smiling. “Yes sir, you have been looking at her the whole time to disprove your words, yes.” “Poh,”—said Mr. Howard, laughing and bringing his eyes back. “I beg your pardon Miss Easy, but sometimes one knows what one cannot see. `Love all, trust a few.'” “With a little trust to the all, and a very special love to the few,” said Mr. Rodney smiling. “I will subscribe to that, Mr. Howard.” My father smiled too, a little—half to himself, as it were. “I don't know whether I must put her among the few,” he said—“I suppose in reality Kate is just like that little intruder over there. Now Grace thinks all the world of that cat, and yet would not for all the world trust her near the open closet.” “But it's her nature, papa,” I said. “Precisely, my dear.” “But it isn't Kate's.”— “What?” said my father laughing—“to steal into the pantry? Which one is the cat going to now, Gracie?” I turned round to watch her progress. She took a good look at me and then marched off towards the window. “Does she like Miss Kate better than you?” said Mr. Collingwood smiling. “O no, but she wants to get on somebody's lap,—if I had been sitting still she would have come right to me. She likes Kate very much though.” “How perfectly graceful!” said Captain De Camp, waving his hand as he surveyed the advancing felina; “there cannot be anything more easy and natural than a cat's motions —every one of them.” And dovetailing two fingers into the breast of his closely buttoned coat, he looked on complacently. Purrer-purrer seated herself in front of Kate, winked once or twice by way of recognition, turned her head, winked once at me, and then with a light spring she reached the desired resting-place. “My dear Kate!” said Miss Bain in an earnest voice, and walking towards the scene of action, “how can you bear that creature!” “Why I like her very much, ma'am,” said Kate, while she stroked the pleased little pussy. Mr. Collingwood and I involuntarily approached the window. “But you shouldn't like her—I can't bear to see you waste your young affections on cats.” Kate smiled—“I should not give it that name Miss Avarintha,—mayn't we apply to one sort of charity what Bunyan says of the other? `A man there was, (though some did count him mad,) The more he cast away, the more he had.'” “Charity!” said Miss Bain—“you are getting very far from the cat.” “And into most classical regions,” said the Captain laughing—“No wonder the cat don't dare to follow!” “Well!” said Kate, looking up with a mingling of displeasure at his and trust in her own position, so bright that it quite dazzled the Captain; “and how are they unclassical? or contemptible sir?” “Contemptible!” said the Captain,—“I really did not mean to go quite so far; but you know Bunyan himself was a very low man.” “And therefore his work, being what it is, stands all the higher.” “But how is it classical, Miss Kate?” said Mr. Collingwood. “I cannot undertake to prove my assertion as well as defend it,” she said laughing and colouring,—“I suppose one of the things Sir Thomas More would have said `women had better not do,' may be to argue with superior information. I refer you and Captain De Camp to Macaulay, Mr. Collingwood, and you can dispute the point with him at your leisure.” “Which is one of the things men had better not do,” said he smiling. “But just see you all this time petting the cat!” said Miss Bain,—“wasting your affections, as I say.” “O,” said Kate, “I don't think one has a measured amount, which must lose in depth what it gains in breadth.” “Nor I.”— “My dear Mr. Rodney,” said Miss Bain, “what can you possibly know of the matter? Bless me, I ought to know a little about cats! my aunt had thirty of them. Now what do you think of that?” “I should think she kept no dogs.” “And I that she had no mice,” said Kate. “Why Miss Avarintha,” said I, “her house must have been like the one in the fairy-tale, where the two green-eyed cats kept watch over the princess.” “And the eight and twenty relieved guard I suppose,” said the Captain laughing. “Bless me!” was all the comment upon this classical allusion. “But why don't you have prettier pets?—a canary or chickens? I like to see a lady encompassed by chickens.” “Not in the house?” said Kate smiling—“and I have no time for canaries and like cats better.” “O so do I, Miss Avarintha! a great deal better!” “O you of course.—I never saw such girls,—just persuade one to like a thing and you've persuaded both. You needn't smile, Mr. Rodney,—it's true.” “My smile meant no contradiction, ma'am.” “It's not a good thing, in my judgment,” said the lady with a new interpretation and answer. “Do tell me now Kate—Miss Stephanie—I've seen so little of her—is she always of your mind? or has she tastes of her own?” “Of her own,” said Kate, trying hard not to smile. “And have you no tastes of your own, Miss Gracie?” said Mr. Collingwood smiling quite. “Indeed she has,” said Kate. “So I thought.” “Take care,” said Miss Bain, “this is a dangerous atmosphere,—a person cannot remain in it long and be dissimilar.” “I'm sure that is a blessing to society,” said the Captain bowing. “But Miss Howard, speaking of tastes—is it permitted to ask what one renders this ice-cream so very delicious?” “I believe,—nothing very uncommon is it?” “Uncommon on our side of the lake. Henderson and I were trying to pronounce upon the flavour of Mrs. Shelton's, and we decided that it `wath pomatum' Miss Kate,” said the Captain laughing. “Pomatum!” exclaimed Miss Bain,—“what a dreadful idea! You don't really mean Captain De Camp that Mrs. Shelton flavours ice-cream with pomatum?” “Not at all, ma'am,—I only mean that this was as near as we could come to it.” “I should think it would have affected you most unpleasantly!” The Captain's present affection was quite ecstatic. “O that was only because gentlemen don't know things by their right names,” said Kate. “Pretty sweeping charge that, against `superior information'!” said Mr. Rodney. “I assure you Miss Kate you would have thought I knew the name of one thing, if you had tasted that ice,” said the Captain. “I heard of a gentleman once,” said Kate, “who asked a lady if her blancmange was flavoured with eye-water.” “That is a good idea!” said the Captain,—“I will inquire about the pomatum.” But Kate disapproved that with a very decided little shake of her head. “Why not, Miss Kate?” said Mr. Collingwood smiling, —“how are men to learn if they may not ask questions?” “They may—if they will only ask in the right way,— and when they really need information,” she said with a look that half applied her words. “But the gentleman I referred to transgressed the first rule,—he should have inquired simply what the flavour was. I hold that it isn't right to suggest disagreeable ideas to people.” “But,” said Captain De Camp, “what are `disagreeable ideas'?—for instance,” he added laughing, “is pomatum reprehensible?” “Very decidedly, if applied to ice-cream that I am eating;—if it is only indefinite ice that I never saw, it does not so much matter.” “But don't you think Katie—” said I— “What?” “Yes let's have your opinion on the pomatum question, Miss Grace,” said the Captain. “Not much of an opinion sir, but I was thinking it wouldn't be pleasant to have disagreeable things said even about other ice-cream, for one might get such an association with it in general. I shouldn't want to think of pomatum every time I eat ice.” “Nor I, I'm sure!” said the Captain laughing. “Your remark is quite just, Miss Grace, and proves what your sister said that you do not always think alike.” “I only said it did not matter so much,” said Kate. “But we do always think alike!” I said,—“only our tastes are a little different sometimes.” “You are drawing very nice distinctions, Miss Gracie,” said Mr. Collingwood while the Captain laughed. “Distinctions about what?” said Stephanie, coming towards us. “We were talking of things agreeable and things disagreeable,” said Kate. “Dividing them off? In which class do you put this interminable noise of katydids? I maintain that nobody can like it, and Miss Easy maintains that she does.” “Ah?” said the Captain. “But where have you put Mr. Freeman?” said Miss Bain. “Where is he?” “I'm sure I don't know, ma'am,” said Stephanie,—“Mr. Freeman is not under my thumb to put anywhere. If he were, he would find himself among things disagreeable.” “Why my dear Miss Holbrook!” said Miss Avarintha, while Stephanie enforced her words by a slight pinch on the back of Kate's neck. “He is talking to my mother,” said Captain De Camp, “but I suppose there is such a class as things agreeabler, Miss Kate? Freeman! face about, will you! “Now,” continued the Captain, “I am going to try how much he knows about names.” “Come up and be questioned Mr. Freeman,” said Mr. Collingwood as he smilingly made room for him in the circle. “Whether I will or no?” “Whether you will or no—and by a gentleman whose knowledge of the subject dates back some fifteen minutes.” “But take some cake first (by your leave, Miss Howard,)” said the Captain handing him the basket. “Now what is it flavoured with?” “This ring?” said Mr. Freeman, as after taking a small bite he collared a digit with the remainder. “It isn't a ring, Mr. Freeman,” I said. “What is it then?” “It's a jumble, sir.” “Well that is certainly making a jumble of plain English! I advise you to remodel your cook-book, Miss Grace.” The “cook-book” was lost upon the gentlemen, but Kate and Stephanie were fain to pat the cat. “But what does it taste of?” said the Captain. “Sugar—” said Mr. Freeman, as if he felt upon sure ground. “Bless my spurs!” said the Captain,—“but what else?” “I'm sure I don't know—the thing I like best about it, is the sugar. Yes, I think there is something else—something I have tasted before too;—it is isinglass!” said Mr. Freeman decidedly. There was no standing this,—the Captain led off and we all had to follow. Even Mr. Howard and the astonished mover of our mirth joined in, they knew not why. “Captain De Camp has been testing Miss Howard's opinion that men don't know everything,” said Mr. Rodney. “Is that all you're laughing at!” said my father,—“bless me, I am told that every day of my life.” “O papa!” said Kate. “I didn't say by whom, Katie,—maybe it's myself.” “But I don't understand,” said Miss Easy's soft voice. “Yes sir, who is it that does not know everything?” “It's an abstract proposition proved upon me, I believe ma'am,” said Mr. Freeman. “Your lesson is but a quarter of an hour behind ours,” said Mr. Rodney. “Mr. Freeman,” said Kate getting up and opening a cabinet, “did you ever see these shells?—papa would tell you that they are worth the trouble.” “And will you tell me the same thing, Miss Kate?” said the Captain. “No sir,” she answered with light gravity, “I know too little of them and of you,—your taste may not lie that way.” The taste of several persons seemed to lie that way just then, and we had full occupation as show-women. Kate laughingly set out a cold collation of “olives” and “pigs,” “poached eggs” and “thorny woodcocks,” which Captain De Camp immediately declared he should choose,—“he went in for utility.” “What do you say to a `weaver's shuttle' then?” said Stephanie,—“don't you call that useful?” “Not to my taste, Miss Holbrook.” “Well here is the ear of King Midas,—and more useful still”— But Kate took the shell out of her hand with a glance which Stephanie did not see fit to disregard. “What is that, Miss Kate?” “This one?” said she taking up another. “It is Venus's comb,—don't you wish to inspect such an antique?” “By no means!” he said with a gesture of refusal— “everything shows best in its proper place.” The shell was immediately restored to the cabinet, and Kate bestowed her attention upon Mr. Freeman. “Here is a perspective shell for you, Mr. Rodney,” I said,—“and this Argonaut—isn't it beautiful?” “I wonder where all the shells get their names!” said Captain De Camp,—“such as this for instance.”— “Why this must have been called after the Argonauts” —I said,—“because it is such a good sailor.” “The Argonauts!” said Captain De Camp. “And pray who were they, Miss Grace?” “Why you know, sir,” said I, as if he wanted to find out the depth of my knowledge—“they were the men that rowed the Argo—the ship in which Jason went after the Golden Fleece.” “I don't know anything about it,”—said the Captain frankly,—“I am ashamed to say, Miss Grace, that I have never read those old stories.” “Papa told me,”—I said. “But what is this shell?” said he helping himself. “Miss Holbrook this is the one you were going to show me.” “That's the most useful shell in the case,” remarked Mr. Freeman. “Well it's one of the prettiest. I don't care much for quirlicues.” “You don't like that”—said Mr. Freeman,—“you wouldn't have one in your room for a dollar.” “I tell you I like it particularly,” said the Captain with an approving and contemplative twirl of his moustaches. “If ever I buy any shells I shall begin with this one.” “I wonder who knows the names of things now!” said Mr. Freeman with an air of injured innocence. “Why man that is a razor shell!” The Captain certainly looked posed for a minute, but then he laughed as if he had received an extraordinary compliment. As for Mr. Freeman,—this turn, together with his previous good-nature, so won upon my father that at parting he gave him a most cordial invitation to come as often as he could. Which invitation the gentleman certainly complied with.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. He must be very wise that can forbear being troubled at things very troublesome. —Tillotson. “WHAT can that light be?” I exclaimed as we passed the hall-window on our way to bed. It was late at night, but some happy combination of circumstances and wakefulness had allowed me to sit up with the rest; and we now stood all together looking out and wondering. A steady red light shone to the north of us, beyond intervening woods and hills, deepening and fading, now clouded and now clear, as smoke and flame chased and displaced each other. In town, so far off a fire would have fixed no eye that was not quick to appreciate the beautiful; but here there were no visions of warring streams of water—the fire burned on in solitude; and instead of bells and rattling engines, there was the soft whirr of a multitude of insects. The flickering light seemed a more wild and fearsome thing in that silence, and we looked with a not untinged admiration. Perhaps men never feel what a weaker and more timid nature feels so readily,—that undefined fear with which mystery can invest even a beautiful object. My father had been called to Baltimore by the illness of his brother; and we left alone, felt all the influences of a simple but unexplained phenomenon. “Wise people we are!” said Stephanie at length,—“of course it's just a house at Wiamee!” “Wiamee is more to the west, and the houses are too small to make such a light.” “Not too small to burn up, are they?” said Stephanie,— “and it may be the whole village; you can't tell west from east in the dark.” “But it does not spread nor move on,” said Kate,—“it burns steadily in one place—there went somebody's roof!” There was a sudden deadening of the light, then it burned furiously for a few minutes, and then seemed to die gradually out. “Exit,”—said Stephanie turning from the window; “it was probably one of Mr. Collingwood's favourite farmhouses, so if we go to bed at once Kate, I don't doubt but we shall dream that we saved all the furniture except a tumbler.” “Here's Misther Barrington ma'am,” said Caddie as she brought in the second plate of muffins next morning. “Mr. Barrington? does he want anything?” “He does ma'am.” “I have no idea,” said Stephanie helping herself to a muffin, “that I could ever have learned the style laconic, if I had been fifty times a Spartan.” “Shew him in here, Caddie,” said my stepmother, and our factotum presented himself. “How are you Ezra?” she continued, “have you got quite well?” “I'm pretty smart, ma'am,” said Mr. Barrington with a strong emphasis on the pronoun. “And Mrs. Barrington, and the children?” “Couldn't be no better,” said Ezra,—“if all folks was as quiet and well-behoven as they be, the world would go on a sight straighter.” “Intimate connection between mankind's obliquity and that of the earth!” said Stephanie.—“What's going crooked Mr. Barrington?” But that gentleman, after the involuntary compliment to his family, had relapsed into silence; and stood with raised brows eyeing the carpet as if it held the key to some problem. The look and attitude were a little startling. “Is anything the matter?” said Mrs Howard. “No ma'am,”—said Ezra hesitating, “nothing partic'lar —only the mill's destructionized.” “Burned down!” cried we all, taking a short cut to the truth. “Jus' so,” said Mr. Barrington looking up in some surprise; “who telled ye?” “Nobody—the light,”—said Kate drawing her breath,— “Dear mamma don't look pale about it!—how did it happen, Ezra?” “Well, I reckon there was sunthin conbustible sot next to it,” said Mr. Barrington, as if he had worked his way to that conclusion. “There warn't no one into it, so it must ha' been done outside.” “Not on purpose?” said Mrs. Howard. “If it warn't a purpose nothin ever was,—the mill didn't burn up of its own head, I'm clear.” “That can't be—it's some carelessness,—nobody would set it on fire.” “Well ma'am,” said Ezra slowly, “they tell me hearsay ain't evidence in a court of judgment, and I s'pose guessing ain't no more,—otherways I'd get that Simpson took up, first thing.” “He could not have had any hand in it,” said Mrs. Howard. “Couldn't hardly been no one else, ma'am. He's always kep' a talking how our mill stopped his `water privilege'— massy knows 'tain't much `privilege' I'd give him, if 'twarn't in the water! Why the Squire ain't an unfriend in the county but him.” “I did not know he was one.” “Like enough,” said Ezra, “but most things can't be known till afterwards. There's my woman said this morning she saw a dreadful big light off to Wiamee, and I telled her she was dreaming of the kitchen fire; so she said wouldn't it be wonderful if it was the mill, and I said wouldn't it be wonderful if she had more sense. Howsever I got tired and went to see, finally, and there it was all ashes and burnt sticks. It took me right on a none-plush,” he added feelingly. We sat silent for a while, not knowing what to say or ask. “But Mr. Simpson wouldn't have done such a wicked thing—and for no reason,” remarked Mrs. Howard. “Folks don't stand about reasons for wickedness, commonly,” said Mr. Barrington with a slight touch of disdain, “or don't wait till they find good ones, anyhow. Mr. Simpson's pretty nigh as fond of hard dollars as most men, and the Squire'd ha' been certain to pick up some of hisn. But the mill's burnt and no mistake, and I s'pose sunthin ought to be done about it.” “Nothing can be done till Mr. Howard comes home Ezra, unless you can find out who has done us this mischief.” “Well, I guess likely,” said Mr. Barrington, “but as to finding out—the likest thing is when a man's got only one enemy, that he's done it. Howsever, I'll look over the Squire's friends—if it don't do no good it can't do no harm, and there's no telling where a blessing may light, as my wife says.” And Mr. Barrington departed, with a face that said the worst part of the business was over. The muffins came in unheeded.— “Surely mamma,” Kate began, “papa has not interfered with anybody's rights?” “I know nothing about it my dear—some one has interfered with his, most certainly: but for the rest we must be in the dark till he comes home,” she added sighing. “It's very good he doesn't know of it!” I said. “Won't you write to him mamma?” said Kate. “No, it's not best,—his head and hands are full enough now; and he ought not to leave his brother for any mill that ever was built.” This was all true, and we acted upon it. But how does a trouble swell when it is locked up! how were we tried by our own quiet endurance! “It seems strange that such a thing should affect us so nearly,” said Kate.—“Just think mamma, two years ago we should hardly have noticed it, and now that mill seemed to be our best hope of getting on.” “I should be sorry indeed if that seeming were reality,” said Mrs. Howard, “and it depends upon circumstances, Katie, whether `to get on' be a blessing or a curse—sometimes the word is `Back for thy life!'” “But Mrs. Howard!” said Stephanie—“how you do talk! Look here,” she added planting herself before her—“now weren't you most troubled because of these girls?” “Yes,” said my stepmother with a voice not yet untroubled, “but my dear child that does not prove me wise or clear-sighted,—perhaps it is for them that I ought to be glad. Better lose the world than rest in it.” We were yet musing over the breakfast-table, when Caddie ushered in another visiter—Mr. Collingwood. “No ma'am, I can't sit down,” he said, “I scarce ought to have come in so early; but dear Mrs. Howard, will you tell me in all frankness—is there anything we can do for you?—my father would have come himself, but he was too unwell.” “Thank him very much, and you too Mr. Rodney, but I think there is nothing: all we can do is to keep ourselves quiet.” “Are you sure? I will see anybody and do anything that you can think of use.” “Quite sure,” said Mrs. Howard, answering his earnest look with a smile that was withal a little tremulous— “unless you will sit down and read us a lesson of patience.” “It would be to myself ma'am,” he said,—“I am but an unpractised learner.” “You see Mr. Collingwood,” said Stephanie—who had a great aversion to that silence when people feel too much to speak—“there's nothing to be done but to build up the mill and catch the burner; and, no disparagement to your strength and wisdom, you can't do either.” “Miss Stephanie,” he said with a smile, “are you laughing yet?” “Only because I'd rather not cry,—one must do something, and Kate always says it's folly to be worried.” “I fear she has not persuaded herself of that,” said Mr. Rodney approaching her. “Miss Kate, are you thinking of those blue mountains?” She looked up to answer him, but the recollection was just one she could not bear,—her eyes fell again. “You remember what we were talking of?” he said very gently—“that they are but like the rest of the world when reached? If we feel sure that our happiness cannot be perfect in this life, we should the less grieve over the things that come to mar it. `In the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast!'” “But she is only worried for papa,” I said, “and because mamma looked so grave.” “And you are troubled for her, Gracie?—I wish I could give you more than sympathy.” “That is the best thing we could have just now,” said my stepmother, “and if your time or exertions can do us any good, Mr. Rodney, we will call for them.” There were indeed but few people to give us sympathy, but they gave it in double measure. Miss Easy came to us the moment she heard of our disaster, and with a face of such quiet sorrow and concern, that our own brightened immediately. “Dear Mrs. Howard,” she said, “could any one think there were such wicked people in the world?—after all the difficulty you have had with that mill! yes ma'am, it really surprises me.” “You must not be troubled for us, my dear friend,” said my stepmother. “Troubled!” said Miss Easy, her eyes filling to their utmost capacity, “yes ma'am I will be troubled—yes. What's the use of friends if they're not to be troubled for each other? Yes ma'am, I hope I am a friend. But how do you all do?—and poor Mr. Howard—what will he say?” “I hardly know—I almost dread his coming home.” “He will bear it well—he has a true christian spirit,” said Miss Easy thoughtfully; “but trials have their effect nevertheless. Though the promise stands sure, `there shall no evil befall them that trust in me.' And yet,” she added sadly as she bent down and kissed my forehead, “I cannot bear to see the weight over this child's eyes,— yes ma'am, that grieves me more than anything.” How quick other eyes in the room answered to her words! “Papa will set it all right when he comes, dear Miss Easy,” I said; “and there will be no weight over my eyes then.” “Nobody could give a better definition of supporting faith,” said Miss Easy with another kiss,—“even so should we trust our heavenly Father—`it will be all set right and there will be no weight over our eyes then.'—Dear Mrs. Howard, that should make the weight sit lighter now.” “It ought and does.” “But can't you all come and stay with me till Mr. Howard gets back? Yes ma'am, now do,” said Miss Easy—“it would make me so happy.” “We must not do it, even for that, dear Miss Easy,” said my stepmother,—“he may come at any time, and would want to find us here.” “True,” said Miss Caffery, “yes ma'am, you are always right, and always think of everything—yes. But I must see you often somewhere—you can at least come for a few hours,—yes, you must promise me that.” And we did. My father came not for three weeks, and after each letter we had a feeling of mingled pain and pleasure,—that he must so soon know—that as yet he knew nothing. But the appointed day came, and with it Mr. Howard. The moment we saw him on the walk, we all felt that he had already heard the news,—not that there was exactly a cloud on his face, but there seemed to be a slight drooping of the head, a relaxing of the muscles, a want of the usual alert resolution of his gait; the very swing of his umbrella spoke of disturbance; and when he entered the house, his greeting if not less affectionate was graver than usual. Since we had lived at Glen Luna one difficulty had come on the heels of another, and this new one was much the worse for the long string which had gone before it. Thoughts took a far range, but our first words were simply, “How is uncle Ned, papa?” “Somewhat better—not satisfactorily so to my mind,” said Mr. Howard throwing himself into a chair. “Dear me—this hot weather is trying!” The weariness of that long breath! “One must not mind even trying things too much,” said my stepmother forcing herself to speak—with what effort the voice told. My father looked at her, and then looked out of the window. “It won't do, Mary,” he said,—“you never can imbue my spirit with the quiet patience of yours. I declare! I thought last night of David's words—`O that I had wings like a dove,—then would I flee away and be at rest!'” “Not from us, papa?” said Kate softly. “My dear child!”—he said, but her words had struck deep,—through all the clouds of doubt, weariness and vexation, clear to the very springs of life and duty,—they rose at once, and after a few minutes my father breathed freer. “When did you hear all this?” said Mrs. Howard. “Yesterday.” “You will not let it worry you papa?” I said—“nothing is so bad as that.” “It is hard not to be a little troubled Gracie—the loss is a very serious one of its kind. I would fain bear it submissively.” And then looking round at us he said, “But you must wear bright faces if you expect me to.” “O we will papa,” said Kate. “Do you think Mr. Simpson could have done this? have you interfered with him in any way?” “No more than I have with you, my dear; but I suppose he thought my mill would deprive his, not of water, but employment. Yes—I presume he did it, or got it done.” “But how could he—what right had he to interfere with your mill? Surely he couldn't take the law into his own hands for any reason.” “He will find he has it on his hands,” said Mr. Howard; “but my own rights are growing so very misty and undefined, that I know but little about those of other people.” Alas we had the law on our hands too! Suits and cross-suits, and pleas and bills and demurrers,—money to be paid for all. Dollars here for witnesses, and there for a journey to some distant court; and again for a speech which Mr. Howard said wasn't worth a pin. The war of poor rights against rich injustice. In the midst of all this expense and annoyance, some pleasant things sprang up. We were greatly touched by an offer from Stephanie of a part of her own small fortune towards the rebuilding of the mill. “My dear child!” said my father, “do you think I would do such a thing? I cannot tell you how it grieves me, that I should be quite unable to add to what you want to divide.” “But Mr. Howard,” said Stephanie, “I feel as if it belonged to you,—you have had trouble and expense enough 7 with me—not to speak of the care and kindness which cannot be paid for,” she added tearfully. “It is all paid for—with interest,” said my father kissing her, while we gathered round with glistening eyes,—“and you will want what you have my dear, depend upon it. Come you must think a little of somebody else.” “If somebody else can't get along without my help,” said she colouring slightly, “he will never get along at all, —so my conscience is clear there. But you, dear Mr. Howard, have lost and suffered so much”— “That I ought to know how to take care of other people. You must let me do it for you as long as I can my dear; it is a pleasure that I shall owe Mr. Freeman some ill-will for depriving me of. No, I will not hear another word, and here comes somebody in good time to receive them all. Mr. Freeman I am very glad to see you, sir, though Stephanie has just been persuading me that I ought to dislike you.” “Dislike me sir?” “You sir.” “And yet you are glad to see me,”—said the gentleman. “Then Miss Stephanie's eloquence must have failed—if she could employ it in so bad a cause.” “She did employ it,” said Mr. Howard gravely; “but as she taught by precept and not example, all I learned was to love her more than ever.” “And if that lesson is not perfect sir, you know where to find the example,” was the smiling reply as Mr. Freeman shook hands with us all round. He had certainly improved since our first acquaintance— or we had learned to appreciate him. Without anything very bright or extraordinary, he had a pleasant mixture of good nature and good sense with a slight spice of peculiarity,—not enough to laugh at but with. Altogether you felt sure Mr. Freeman would get on in the world, though you never thought of his making a stir therein. Stephanie too had improved,—perhaps by the prospect of real life before her, or as she said “of the arctic ocean”; and the feeling that Mr. Freeman's house was tolerably glazed, may have made her more tender of other people's windows. So it was, that while her chance of happiness increased, our unwillingness to part company increased also; and at length Mr. Freeman declared that he never came to the house without feeling as if he were going “birdth-nethting.” The bird was fledged at length. Stephanie and Mr. Freeman were married one fair day when the autumn was showering gold leaves; and beneath a blue October sky they went forth into the world to seek their fortune.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. The simmer is gane, when the leaves they were green; And the days are awa that we hae seen; But far better days, I trust, will come again. Lady Mary Ann. “WE shall have a lonely winter of it,” said Miss Easy, as she sat at our tea-table some two weeks after Stephanie's departure,—“yes ma'am, we shall indeed.” “We shall,” said Mrs. Howard, “it will take us some time to get used to the change; but you, Miss Easy?”— “Didn't you know that Mr. Rodney is going away?” “Mr. Rodney!” cried I. “Not for the winter?” said mamma and Kate. “Yes ma'am, for the winter. Farmer Collingwood's health seems even less good than usual, and nothing will content Mr. Rodney but to have his father try a warmer climate. So they are both going,”—and Miss Easy's voice went with them. “I am very sorry indeed,” said Mrs. Howard. “Yes ma'am, every one must be that,—we are all sorry, yes; but I have always seen so much of him—and the Bermudas are a long way off.” “Bermuda—do they go there?” “Yes; and what troubles me most, is, that I fear they can ill afford the expense. The Farmer I know thinks so, yes ma'am; but Mr. Rodney won't hear or allow a word of it. So they go,” she repeated with a sigh, “the first of December.” “He should command my purse, if I had one that wasn't filled with other people's fingers,” said my father coming out of his brown study. Miss Easy looked very much concerned. “My dear sir,” she said, “pray don't think of such a thing!—dear me, what have I said! I am very sorry indeed, yes sir. But I never can get him to speak on the subject—it's only my own notions, yes; pray don't think of it again. I should have been wiser, but I thought you were dreaming, as we say. Yes sir, I did indeed.” “You thought about right ma'am,” said my father; “but like most dreamers I was weaving a web of mixed truth and falsehood, and your words were the nearest realities that came to hand. But I must think of this matter,—I must find out how it is; and if he wants anything, I will dispose of the other fingers somehow—he shall have it.” “My dear Mr. Howard! that is like you,” said Miss Easy,—“but now sir you mustn't do such a thing. If you would be willing to act for me—if you should find what I have feared, true; I have spare funds, yes sir,—at least I think I could get them—and Mr. Rodney would never take anything from me, but perhaps I might do it through you, yes sir.” “No ma'am,” said my father; “I will neither take credit that does not belong to me, nor let you deprive yourself of a single comfort if I can help it,—the business must be managed some other way.” “It would be to give myself comfort,” said Miss Easy sighing, “if I could relieve that poor boy from what I fear he has taken upon himself, and what I know is too much for him.” “And what is that?” said my stepmother. “Earning money ma'am, in all times and ways,—yes ma'am, I am sure he is not always studying,—I am sure he is trying to provide for this journey. Why I can hardly get sight of him.” “But what could he do—out here?” said my father. “O I don't know sir—copying, and translating and draughting,—he is good at everything. Why sir,” said Miss Easy with sparkling eyes, “he taught school in the first place till he could prepare himself for college; and then he paid his own way when there,—and his brother's too, for that matter—so long as he would stay. And was always at the head of everything too—though he spent half of the study hours in hearing recitations. I suppose he's ahead of every one now, for he has studied harder than ever since he came home,—too much for his health, I know.” “I hope he will get as much good as his father, from the journey,” said Mrs. Howard. “He don't want to go ma'am, not at all, for himself,—yes ma'am, I think he looks very sober about it.” “Hush!—” said my father,—and Caddie opening the door announced Mr. Collingwood. Sober he did look, or it might be fatigued, but with no tinge of gloominess in either eye or voice,—there never was a nature more absolutely without it. Had the business of his life been to seek his own individual pleasure, in the pleasantest way, Mr. Collingwood could not have looked more free from doubt and discontent. “I have been to see you Miss Easy,” he said after the first salutations;—“and Miss Avarintha told me you were here,—so I thought my escort might not come amiss. I haven't given you a chance to get tired of me lately.” “Nor us either, I am sure,” said my stepmother,—“do you think it necessary to excuse yourself for coming here once a month?” “No ma'am,” he said smiling,—“it is not quite so long since my last visit.” “But you ought to come very often Mr. Rodney,” I said —“when we like to see you so much.” “And when it is so soon to be ended,” said Mrs. Howard. A grave bow, and a look where there was too much feeling for a smile, answered both remarks; and after a moment he said, “Yes, very soon.” “How is your father to-night, Mr. Rodney?” said Miss Easy. “Not well ma'am: I hope he will gain strength when we are once off, but I think the idea of the journey rather fatigues him.” “But my dear sir,” said my father, “why don't you go at once?—you ought have finished your journey by the first of December, instead of beginning it. Surely two gentlemen need not be so long getting ready.” The deep flush which crossed Mr. Rodney's face while my father spoke, seemed to confirm Miss Easy's words: it was but a moment however, and then in his usual quiet way he said, “You are quite right Mr. Howard,—I am truly sorry our decision was not made sooner.” “But it wants three weeks to December—why not set off at once?” Again the flush, the slight hesitation; and then with a smile came the answer. “Nay sir, I have arranged to go on the first of December, and we must even wait till then. Miss Avarintha would tell you that it is owing to my `native obstinacy'.” “How long shall you stay?” said Mr. Howard abruptly changing his ground. “I cannot tell sir. If, as Dr. Revere thinks, the climate should particularly suit my father's health, we may be there long,—perhaps permanently.” “You don't mean, always, Mr. Rodney?” “Always is a long word Gracie,” he said, smiling half in spite of himself at my earnestness,—“I am sure I do not wish to speak it in such a connexion.” “You haven't seen Bermuda yet,” said my father. “No sir.”— “Characteristically disposed of!” said Mr. Howard laughing,—“you won't even condescend to notice my insinuation.” “What kind of a place is Bermuda, papa?” said Kate. “Really my dear I know very little about it, though I have heard a great deal. But as people always praise what they do like, and slander what they don't, my knowledge of Bermuda is simply geographical.” “And mine,” said Mr. Rodney; “but if I live to come back Miss Kate, you shall have at least such a one-sided account as Mr. Howard refers to.” “Who takes care of Daisy Lea while you are gone?” asked my stepmother. “Mrs. Crown and her nephew, for the present ma'am.” “And Wolfgang?”—said Kate and I together. “Wolfgang,” said Mr. Rodney turning to us with a smile, “is to live at the Bird's Nest,—so he will be further than ever from Purrer-purrer, Miss Gracie.” “Ah he will come here sometimes,” I said, “and we shall go to see him. How he will miss you Mr. Rodney!” “Miss me?—yes, a little,—I hope so, I should like to be missed. And yet it is a selfish hope too,” he said, as he rose in obedience to Miss Easy's summons. “Strange, that one should wish to give pain to one's friends!” “But if you take away the power of pain Mr. Collingwood,” said Kate, “the power of pleasure goes with it.” “And the power of usefulness too, in a measure,” said my father,—“they are all interwoven.” “Then I will be as selfish as possible,” he answered smiling; “good night.” My father mused for a while after they were gone, and then jumping up he said, “I shall just go out and waylay that boy, for I sha'n't rest till I know the truth.” But at the end of an hour he came back with an unenlightened face. “And what is the truth?” said Mrs. Howard. “The truth is that Mr. Rodney is rather the best and most unmanageable person in the world. I dashed into the subject at once, according to custom, and without more than half an apology; but he either made up the other half, or didn't want it.” “And did you get any satisfaction?” “Not a bit—except as I tell you as to his being a little better than other people. He didn't attempt to deny or remove my suspicions and inferences, but I could get no further—he was as stiff as buckram. Only he gave me much warmer thanks than I deserved, and left me, I do believe, with wet eyes.” How swiftly those three weeks sped away!—and we saw but little of the friends that were to follow them. Even when we all walked over to the Lea to visit once more its kind master, he was so unwell that we were not admitted. But he grew better after that; and on the last day of November Mr. and Mrs. Howard went again to see him. It was Sunday afternoon; and Kate and I sat alone in our little tea-room, singing hymns,—going over with a strange pleasure the bright hopes and anticipations which we had no share in. One and another was finished, and at last that one—“I am bound for the kingdom,” when we became aware of Mr. Rodney's presence. We had heard neither door nor step; but as our voices ceased he came forward, shook hands with us silently, and then seating himself by us, he said, “`Bound for the kingdom'—dear friends are you indeed that?” We did not answer—we could not. The hymn had wrought upon us both a good deal, yet in an indefinite, unfruitful sort of way; but now with these applying words came its full force,—duty, responsibility, privilege—all neglected, seemed now all set before us,—all weighing us down. What had we been singing—“bound for the kingdom!”—and the intention had never entered our hearts! Mr. Collingwood looked at us earnestly; and perhaps he read in the quivering lips and half-interrupted breath, the negative to his question; for he added very gravely, and yet with even more than his accustomed kindness and gentleness, “If not for it, then from it!” True! true!—and with bowed heads and weeping eyes we gave silent assent to his words. “There is no better description of a Christian's life,” he said presently,—“there can be no more perfect reply to the trials of it. `Bound for the kingdom,'—as a ship is bound that even in adverse winds so sets her sails that she is driven forward, or so casts anchor that she is not driven back; and for that kingdom which is so beyond comparison with all others, that there is no need of specification,—`the kingdom'!—that is enough! Enough for him too,—the light that sheds one straight, undeviating line of brightness over the restless sea—uneclipsed by the sun, unhid by the cloud; that lures him to breast the waves, though trembling, shuddering with their violence, yet still on! He is homeward bound, and for the kingdom!” Again he paused, and again did our hearts answer to every word that came so warm, so energized from his: yet we could not speak. As when the wind comes out dead ahead, and checked, startled, the ship seems uncertain how to trim her shivering sails, so did we hesitate,—not from doubt of the right, but from a mixture of bewilderment, surprise and fear. Had we then been bound on a reef?— from “the kingdom?” “Yes!” said Mr. Collingwood at length, as if he read our thoughts; “for it or from it!—you cannot choose but be one. Dear Miss Howard, dear Gracie, think of it! bound from the kingdom! from its blessings, its rest, its everlasting reward!” We were weeping bitterly; and for some time there was no word spoken, except now and then one of counsel or entreaty from Mr. Collingwood. But at length Kate exerting all her self-command, looked up and thanked him in a few earnest words for what he had said,—while I, whose feelings were less under control, dared not trust my voice. “God grant we may all sail on together!” he said sighing; “and to that shore where there can be no shipwreck.” And then taking a hand of each, Mr. Rodney parted from us with the words of Samuel Rutherford, “I shall rejoice to hear of your welfare, and that your faces are up the mountain!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. The game of life Looks cheerful when one carries in one's heart Th' inalienable treasure. Coleridge. YES, that was a lonely winter. For our spirits had not now that full tide which sweeps away slight obstructions, sports with them, tosses them a one side in a mask of its own foam;—now, the current had need of a clear channel. We all missed Stephanie's bright, unshadowed eye, Farmer Collingwood's morning visits, and the frequent sight and hearing of Mr. Rodney—so many of the visiters we had left talked neither sense nor sympathy. And then without any defined cloud, the light of our fortunes and prospects seemed declining; though as in the day's twilight, we hardly realized the progress except when we looked back. Things were changed. We were changed ourselves —how much, from that first bright day when I came to Glen Luna! Ah me!—it was a necessary, inevitable change —the young heart cannot keep its spring,—and yet it makes mine ache now to think of it. I had not lost the childish simplicity of hope and enjoyment, but upon it was grafted a scion of real life, to which all fresh shoots of the former must in time be sacrificed. And I was softly passing from the brook to the river, and knew it not! As the winter passed, we felt more and more the truth of Mr. Rodney's words,—were more and more resolved to follow them. We could have answered him now;—yes, we were “bound for the kingdom”! There had been sundry new things done and begun in our neighbourhood: if Time drove not in full career through that quiet seclusion, we yet saw the dust of his chariot wheels. Surely if “there is no new thing under the sun,” it might almost be said, that in one sense neither is there any old! The very tree at the house door is not to-day what it was last year; and this other, behind which the chimneys loomed up, unapproachable, now towers above them, and throws its leaves and shadows upon the roof beyond. The stone step which in all its rough newness said “I have just come”; how lovingly the turf closes upon its edge, how firmly the green tufts cling and grow, even encroachingly. The rains and the dews have bleached its grey, and loved feet have worn its hardness— it is “an old inhabitant.” Shadows where there was sunshine—the wearing down of what seemed unchangeable,—yes, such is Time's work: but here see his work too—the opening of a fair view that before was hid,—a path for the light through a dark forest that seemed impenetrable. Foremost among the changes—not in itself but in its effect—was the death of Mr. Cary—the minister at Lake End. He was succeeded by a man of strong mind and body, with a will that spared neither, when they could be of use,—and we could go to church once more. Then we realized what we had been without. I never knew what sermons were worth, till I heard them after those years of privation. Consequent upon this came another comfort. It was clearly our duty to go to church, therefore it was a duty to have bonnets and cloaks to go in; and little as Kate and I cared about dress, it was pleasant to feel free to go where we wished, like other people. Mr. Ellis was not the only new comer,—the McLoons had settled in the neighbourhood, and we had Mrs. Willet and other old friends for prospective vis-à-vis at the Sulphur spring. Yet from all these we turned with what pleasure to the Bird's Nest!—Miss Easy was more beloved than ever, and these novelties faded away by contrast. She always came to us as soon as she got a letter from Bermuda, to bring news and messages: always gave us comfort when it was most needed; and would sometimes lay her hand sighingly upon my forehead, as if she feared the weight were there still. My father could not resolve to leave the mill in ruins all the time the law suits were pending, but had set men to rebuild as fast as possible; though Mr. Barrington avowed his belief that “Mr. Simpson could burn it down more speedier than we could put it up.” As yet however, there had been no interference, but with the spring came “nimble mischance” in another form. I came down one Monday morning, when after several days of warm, breaking-up rain, earth and sky looked their loveliest, and found Mr. Howard putting on shoes that were unmistakeably for out of doors. “You won't have any time for pruning, papa,” I said, “breakfast is just ready, and here come mamma and Kate.” “Don't wait for me,” said my father tying his shoestrings with needless energy. “Why where are you going?” “To Wiamee creek.”— “To the mill!—so early!” said my stepmother,—“Oh wait till after breakfast.” “There is no mill there, nor anything else that I know of, but water,” he answered; and then seeing our anxious faces, he added in that tone of desperate calmness which betrays the excitement it is meant to cover, “These rains have brought a tremendous freshet, and the mill is carried away.” How my heart sank!—and then in a moment I said, “Dear papa, do not look so grave,—maybe it is not so bad as you think.” “It's as bad as it can be, I fancy,” said my father sighing. “But do not look grave about it, still, papa,” said Kate; “perhaps it can be mended, if it is bad; and at all events let us take things quietly.” “See that you set me a good example then,” he said, looking first at mamma and then at us. We followed him to the door, and called out, “Now don't stay long—come back and get some breakfast, and then you can go again;” and he gave us one smile that spoke of more trouble than even the cloud had done. Silently we sat down and waited; and the hearts to which the birds sang songs grew heavy and inattentive, and the brightening light of the sun seemed more and more uncongenial, until at last Mr. Howard returned. The damage was not quite so great as it might have been—at least it could be repaired with dollars,—but where were they to be had? There were some yet, my father said—he would find ways and means; and once in order, the mill would soon pay for itself. Would it ever do that? would it ever be in order?—Both questions might be read in my stepmother's face, but Mr. Howard heeded them not, and having talked himself into at least temperate latitudes, he went off again; and we staid at home and talked our spirits down to zero.— And then of all days in the year, Mrs. McLoon came to see us; and of all subjects of conversation, she chose the mill. And in the pure thoughtlessness of wealth told us how she had been riding past Wiamee, and had seen the carried-off timbers,—and how she was amused; and how the water had grouped them here and there,—and laughed all the while at her own description, till we were in doubt whether to cry or be angry. But, as says some French paper, “Avec le `Go Head,' qui personnifie en lui l'audace dans l'entreprise, et le `No Mind,' qui represente le courage dans l'adversité, l' Américain du Nord accomplit des prodiges.”— My father had both principles in action. No loss, no discouragement could affect his practice: the head might be weary of arrangements, the mind sick of endeavours, yet the hand rarely stayed its workings. Arrangements and endeavours were made and forwarded as if “time was” had come back to us; and if sometimes the first brush of a disaster would sweep before it even the will to do,—the calm followed; and patience and faith-nerved energy came with the thought, “Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” Again men were set to work at the mill, and then my father got his witnesses together, and went to attend one of the Simpson trials. To no purpose,—the trial was put off. “It is very vexatious, isn't it papa?” said Kate. “Trying enough—and expensive enough too, that's the worst of it.” “But this won't hinder your building up the mill?” “Hinder it completely. If the whole affair was to be settled in a few weeks, I thought I might venture to go on and rebuild; but I can't count upon Simpson's forbearance for six months. No, I must get the mill-dam in good order, and then wait patiently for September.” Mrs. Howard sighed. “No need to sigh about it my dear,” said my father cheerfully; “it will all come right—it is all right now. Being assured of that we may well submit to what God sends.” “But papa,” said I, “that does not prevent our feeling troubled—do you think it can?” “Submission,” said my father, “is a very different thing from insensibility,—it never was intended Gracie, that trials should be unfelt, for then their end would be unattained. `No trial for the present seemeth joyous, but grievous'; and pain, sickness and poverty are in themselves evils. Yet if we are `walking the way of God's commandments,' we need fear nothing that shall meet us—not even the passing pain; for with it God may give such views of `the rest that remaineth,' that all the intervening labour and weariness shall seem but as a sweet preparation.” “One must have strong faith for that,” said Mrs. Howard with a half sigh. “Yes, and strong love. Do you remember the account given of some lady, who when she was about to submit to a dreadful operation, gave to one of the physicians the last letter which had come from her husband, asking him to hold it before her. And with her eyes fixed upon the open page and love-traced characters, she sat unmurmuring, unfainting throughout the whole. “So let a man but keep eye and heart fixed upon the words of Christ, `As my Father hath loved me, so have I loved you,' and `Lo I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world'; and they will gild even the deepest sorrows,—how much more such trifles as beset us.” “Do you think they are quite trifles, papa?” said Kate. “Yes dear, they are trifles—such trifles as `make up the sum of human things,'—not motes in the short sunshine of a day, I grant you; but pour on them a light from the eternal world— “`Fear not little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom'—are they not trifles now?” And with one look of joy and tears Kate and I had put our arms round each other; for we too could see the distant light which shone upon my father's sea of troubles. The time of the next trial approached. Hitherto we had known nothing of witnesses except that they cost a good deal, and were troublesome and hard to get,—so much Mr. Howard had imparted to us in different fits of discomfort. Our fits were to come now. The night before my father went to meet judge and jurors at Amherst two men were ushered into the parlour, whom we at once placed in the said witness class,—they were not gentlemen, they were not beggars; and their conversation with my father savoured strongly of hydraulics and water privilege. The older and larger of the two, had more of himself than he seemingly knew what to do with; and certainly more than suited our slight chairs and country doorways. One organ of vision eyed you curiously with humour, sense, consciousness and determined unconsciousness of his position; while the other scanned the corner or looked out of the window, —there was no “right and tight” about Mr. Barnabeds. His free and easy manner, however, was not tinctured with impropriety nor disrespect—neither with their opposites: on the whole he was rather amusing. His companion Mr. Pegraph, was a little pug-dog of a man, as knowing and opinionative as if he had swallowed and digested all the books that ever were written. So desperately smart too, and so satisfied with his own smartness, that one laughed with a slightly provoked feeling. “My dear father!” said Kate when they had at last gone to bed, “how could you let those men come here?” “Because they are to give testimony for me to-morrow.” “Of course—that might take them to Amherst, but why bring them here?” “I should have had to pay for their night's lodging somewhere; and I didn't suppose they would contaminate our roof by sleeping under it once.” “Contaminate! no papa, I should hope not; but they're not fit to be in ladies' society, nor gentlemen's either.” “They are not going to be—they are here for one night to suit my convenience. I have no money to spare, unfortunately.” “Certainly, that may make it all right and necessary,” said Kate; “but then papa you must allow that it is bad in other respects. Just imagine their being seen here!” “Everybody is welcome to see them so far as I am concerned,” said Mr. Howard. “Stand upon your own true dignity my child, and not upon an unsteady heap of notions. Neither lady nor gentleman need be hurt by such intercourse as may be necessary, with people far below them. These men are respectable in their own station, and their being here is nobody's business.” So we paid a little comfort for the entertainment of the witnesses. Four days was Mr. Howard away; but on the afternoon of the fifth the door opened, and there stood my father on a background of Mr. S. T. Barnabeds. “You have not succeeded, papa!” I exclaimed. “Yes I have Gracie,” he answered with a smile,—“what made you say that?” “I thought you looked sober papa.” “And how should he look Miss Grace?” said the unwelcome witness; “sober, indeed! and at this time of day too! why what do you take us for?” “Us!” thought I. “Succeeded fairly papa?”— “Fairly as far as I have succeeded at all,—this is not quite the end, but I can go on and put up the mill.” We were too happy to be sorry for anything; and our graciousness produced a corresponding effect upon Mr. Barnabeds. He scattered snuff about the room till I was exceeded, and told absurd stories at which we couldn't help laughing; and considering that we wished him anywhere else, this last was vexatious. “Queer things these currents of air, sir,” said Mr. Barnabeds with a knowing nod of his head, while the cool fall wind swept round the house with a roar as of displeasure at being shut out from the breakfast-table,—“very queer things! Ugh! that's cool,” he said nodding to me. “Well sir, up here at my friend Hackett's—why you may go on the piazza with a lighted candle, and on the roof it would nearabout take two men to hold one man's hair on his head.” “I should think it highly probable,” said my father dryly. “And who would take care of the heads of the two men?” said I. “Won't you take some corn bread, Mr. Barnabeds?” said my stepmother, not knowing how he might relish such rejoinders. “No I'm obliged to you Mrs. Howard,—I've been paying my devours to the white—the bread par excellence— no disrespect to the corn variety. As to the other two men Miss Grace, they haven't been up there yet; so it's impossible to say what would happen. I presume an Englishman would predict that they would return un'armed from their violent exertions. By the way Mr. Howard, what a sharp Yankee you've got here for a farmer.” “Barrington?” said my father. “That's the man—he's cute enough to make nutmegs.” “And much too honest.”— “I tell you he's a sharp one, sir. I remarked to him that we had a good load—that was the other day when we went out—alluding to my own weight, which is a trifle above yours sir. And then I said what should we do if the wagon broke down. And the chap looks at me out of the corners of his eyes, `Well,' he says, `I guess about the first thing we'd do would be to set it up again—arter you sir.' Ever fish, Mr. Howard?” “Never.” “Must be good fishing here too—afraid of the proverb sir?—`a fish at one end and a fool at the other,' you know.” “I should certainly prove the last to my own satisfaction,” said my father—“I'm afraid the fish would be wanting.” “Speaking of wants,” said our guest—“you haven't got a pair of old slippers or anything of that sort, have you sir?—these boots are boots.” My father looked dubious. “I have a pair of slippers—if you can wear them,” he said under the promptings of truth and hospitality. “O anything's better than these.” I was sent for the slippers, and Mr. Barnabeds having left the table, tried them on. “A trifle too large sir,” he said pulling the slipper half way on, and then doubling down the heel that his might reach terra-firma—“don't matter, it all comes of my having such a small foot.” “That man,” said my father, returning to the breakfastroom half an hour after, “is wearing my new slippers slipshod, all round the garden in the mud!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. For lo! the board with cups and spoons is crowned, The berries crackle, and the mill turns round; On shining altars of japan they raise The silver lamp; the fiery spirits blaze; From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide, While China's earth receives the smoking tide. Rape of the Lock. OF course when our Philadelphia friends arrived, we felt bound to call and see them; but further than that we could not go. Entertainments were out of our power, and so many were given by other families, that the strangers had small time or inclination for mere tea-drinkings. Thus our intercourse with them rather languished; their visits were seldom, their invitations Mrs. Howard usually declined. “So you wouldn't come to the party!” said Mrs. Willet with a slight air of pique, as she reclined in our dormeuse one morning. “Mr. Howard was not at home to go with us,” said my stepmother. “Why didn't you tell me that was the reason!” exclaimed the lady, “I could have sent you quite a bodyguard. Plenty of young men that would like nothing better. Well you're coming next week?” Mrs. Howard shook her head. “Now don't say one word—I shall be really hurt if you don't. Kate, I know it will do you good, and your husband will be here to go with you—your father I mean,” she added as the flush on Kate's cheeks disentangled her thoughts,—“la, child, I never think what I'm saying. But will you come?—I know it's good for these girls—I want Grace to come too.” It was a plea my stepmother felt, and still she hesitated. “Now if you're thinking of dresses,” Mrs. Willet proceeded, “that makes no sort of difference—just come in your country clothes—nothing can be prettier. Simplicity's the true style after all,” said the lady arranging her volants. “They are in no danger of adopting any other style,” said Mrs. Howard, who could not forbear smiling. “Yes, but it don't do to be too simple. Now Kate my dear, never be afraid to put a bow of ribbon in your hair, or under your collar here,”—she said, touching the little crescent which fastened the band of lace round Kate's throat,— “or loop up your sleeves with it—so,—pink, if you like it, or blue would look well—you have such white arms—it's so sweet and becoming. And if you want a dress a little nicer than usual,” said Mrs. Willet, while Kate's face took for a moment an expression of proud and somewhat scornful self-respect, “just get tarleton,—it costs very little, and it's the prettiest thing a young girl can wear.—I keep Caroline in it all winter, (I'm so sorry she's away now,) and when one wears out, I get her another. Just have it made with three deep tucks, and boddice, or sash if you like, and wear a bow of the same ribbon in your hair. There can't be anything more pretty and suitable. Now goodbye—I shall expect you.” “I wonder if she thinks we don't know how to dress ourselves!” said Kate as the door closed. “She means it all kindly,” said Mrs. Howard smiling. “I should like to see myself with a bow of ribbon in my hair!” was Kate's uncompromising reply. And if any style could have told Mrs. Willet as much, Kate would probably have adopted it for that evening,—as it was, she had to content herself with the negative teaching of beautiful hair, in its usual quiet arrangement. Mrs. Willet's house was lavishly lined with comfort and money, but the first came in per favour of the second; for there was no particular taste or judgment displayed anywhere. Yet the purse will do a good deal if you give it carte blanche, and the rooms shewed not the wants of their mistress. She herself in a white turban, came forward from a circle of new and old friends; and receiving us very graciously, carried off Mrs. Howard to the circle; while my father gazed abstractedly at the bisque on the mantelpiece, and Miss Suydam called Kate and me to take seats by her. Unlucky request! Mrs. Willet presently came up in dismay. “My dear girls what can you possibly be thinking of? Why I never heard of such a thing!” “As what ma'am?” “Why—bless me!—here you are three ladies on this sofa and no gentlemen even near you.” “So much the better,” said Miss Suydam—“then they won't overhear our conversation, Mrs. Willet.” “Why Jane!—how can you talk so! here,” she said turning about and laying hold of the first three coat-sleeves that came in her way, “your services are wanted in this direction. Mr. Elliot—Miss Howard, Miss Grace Howard —my nephew Mr. La Roche,—Miss Suydam, Captain De Camp. Now for pity's sake don't sit two ladies together.” And giving a downward glance at her frock waist, Mrs. Willet walked away. “Is this what you call `open ranks,' Captain?” said Miss Suydam as with a gesture of impatience she moved to one corner of the sofa and motioned me to the other. But Kate, not well pleased with such manifest manœuvres, sat in absolute gravity as two of the gentlemen laughingly placed themselves on either side of her; while Mr. La Roche perceiving that a sixth place was not, folded his arms and taking a position in front of me, remarked, “Well Miss Grace, I suppose I am to stand up and do the agreeable to you.”— The resignation of this speech set us all to laughing, and Mrs. Willet looked back quite satisfied with her arrangements. So were also the gentlemen on the sofa; but Mr. La Roche grew weary of some part of his position, and after a few sentences he walked off to bestow his time and talents elsewhere. Thus left to amuse myself, the loud talking of sundry people furnished a fair supply of thoughts and information—using the common meaning of both. Now a voluble lady would pour out a long string of news and descriptions; or a delicate city-made gentleman would utter compliments and commonplaces in a tone that was perfumed like his pocket-handkerchief. Exclamations of all sorts came with so little discrimination, that one had need to be told, “this is for joy and this for sorrow.” Then a word from Miss Easy or my stepmother would reach my ear—speaking truth, heart and simplicity; or one of my father's energetic, pointed expressions, had all the pleasant effect of a straight line in a picture of curves. “My dear Kate,” said Mrs. Willet while I was drawing comparisons, “do go and sing us something—there's nothing so pleasant as music. Couldn't you sing a duet with somebody to accompany you?” “No ma'am, I don't think I could,” said Kate gravely. “Well anything else then. Come my dear—a prompt compliance!” And as Kate went to the piano, Mrs. Willet with a touch and whisper sent Mr. La Roche in the same direction, while herself flitted about observantly. Then seating herself by my father, “O Mr. Howard, I do take such an interest in the love affairs of young people!” “Do you?” said my father at no pains to repress his smile. “O very great! Amelia,” she said looking towards the piano and beckoning her daughter—“tell your cousin to come here.” And with another whisper Mr. La Roche was ordered somewhere else. “You see,” said Mrs. Willet turning again to my father, “I sent him to turn over the leaves for Kate—I wanted to see if it would disturb her.” “Did you?” said Mr. Howard again. “Yes, and I found it did; so I called him away.” My father gave an involuntary glance towards the piano, but the unconscious victim of curiosity had returned to her seat and was talking with Capt. De Camp. “Very fine young man, that!” said Mrs. Willet. “Is he?” said my father, who had fallen into the laconics. “O very fine!”—then raising her voice, “Captain, can't you give us a song? some little military ballad?” “No ma'am, I never went further than military exercises,” was the chuckling reply. “O but you can sing something!” “No I can't ma'am,” said the Captain bowing. “Dear me!” said Mrs. Willet, “that is very extraordinary.” “Not at all ma'am,” said my father,—“there are many fine young men that have not fine voices—even in the army. I presume the `Ha!—hum!' adjurations tend rather to power than sweetness.” Mrs. Willet looked puzzled, and my father looked at the ceiling. “Nothing up there worth your notice, Mr. Howard,” said Squire Suydam pausing in his perambulation. “Where then?” said my father with a half smile. “Miss Avarintha!” called out Mrs. Bulger across the room,—“Miss Avarintha! look at Squire Suydam—he is absolutely sporting a moustache!” “Squire Suydam!” said the echo—“I would not have thought it! You, sir, of all men! Well I am surprised!” The Squire turned, and bowed his acknowledgements. “Daresay ma'am,—don't doubt I shall astonish you a good many times before I die, Miss Avarintha; but as to a moustache, I haven't a sign of such a thing—unless they're catching,—I took a ride with the Captain this morning— maybe that's how it is.” Nobody laughed louder at this than the gentleman referred to, who evidently thought himself complimented. “`Pale faces'!” said my father musingly and half to himself,—“the Indians would have to invent some new name for us now. If any part of a man's face shews its natural colour, it's because he can't help it.” And then, still in an under tone my father proceeded. “`Some are reaped most substantial like a brush, Which makes a nat'ral wit known by the bush; (And in my time of some men I have heard, Whose wisdom have been only wealth and beard,) Some like a spade, some like a fork, some square, Some round, some mowed like stubble, some stark bare; Some sharp, stiletto-fashion, dagger-like, That may with whisp'ring a man's eyes outpike; Some with the quadrate, some triangle fashion, Some circular, some oval in translation; Some perpendicular in longitude, Some like a thicket for their crassitude, That heights, depths, breadths, triforme, square, oval, round, And rules geometrical in beards are found.' Think of the world's travelling back to 1630!” “Well remembered!” said Mr. Suydam laughing, “I should think you might have missed some of the varieties.” “Couldn't”— said my father,—“just look about you. There's a stiletto opposite, and an oval by the fireplace, and triangles enough to make one think the world is standing on end. My dear sir I can't find any plain surface to look at, but the ceiling,—and there's a bearded Silenus in the mouldings up there!” Mr. Howard roused himself from his gloomy contemplations and talked briskly with the Squire till the little French clock jogged his elbow,—then he came to where we sat and gave us sundry taps on the shoulder as a gentle intimation that he was ready to go. And Mrs. Willet's arguments failed to convince him that the hour was very early or our house very near. “This is a great deal pleasanter than all those people!” I said as we walked home; and when by two or three deep exhalations I had purified my lungs from the atmosphere of bouquet and badinage. “Our Katie sang better than her little namesakes, though,” said Miss Easy with a smile. We were on our way to the Bird's Nest. “But Kate is one of these people,” I said laughing, “and that is quite different you know, Miss Easy.” “Quite another thing, Gracie.” “And yet one cannot help being amused,” said Kate— “I'm sure I have been.” “What an interesting woman is Mrs. Willet!” said Miss Avarintha from behind; “I think she is quite remarkable.” “She certainly is,” said my father dryly—“especially in point of judgment.” “Yes, especially, as you say sir.” “But Miss Easy,” said Kate, “you don't speak—don't you like to see people?” “Yes,” said Miss Easy—“some people and sometimes, yes,—and yet I rather agree with Grace, and like stars better than gas-lights.” 8 “I'm sure I do,” said Kate. “But I believe I like company better than Grace does.” “I wish she liked it better,” said Miss Easy. “You needn't wear such a grave face Gracie, till you are as old as I am at least.” “As old as you are! dear Miss Easy,” said Kate. “Yes,” she answered affectionately, “I am what most people call old, Katie—yes. But I don't feel old, that's one great blessing; and it doesn't trouble me to think of it—that's another.” “Isn't Mr. Rodney coming home any more, Miss Easy?” I said: “isn't there any hope of his coming soon?” “I don't know whether I ought to say hope or fear,” she said, with a tone that had lost its bright cheerfulness. “Yes, I expect him—he will not come if his father continues better, but that can hardly be.” “Do you think so Miss Easy?” said Kate; “that last letter was grave, certainly, but was it more sad than usual?” “It seemed to me less hopeful. And then these journies—I know, I have seen them tried—they do so little good. I think we shall hear worse news.” She was right. Farmer Collingwood's health which had at first improved rapidly, declined as fast; and he died in Bermuda just a year from the time of his leaving Daisy Lea. Close upon this came another loss, and to us a much nearer one—the death of Mr. Ned Howard. We had expected it, he had never been well since the year before,— but though surprise might have increased the first shock, it could hardly have added to our grief,—that was to be of years. The autumn leaves had meaning in them now, as they fell fluttering from the branches, and the wind took up our half stifled sighs, and breathed them out over the strewn earth, till we could have wept at the expression of our own thoughts. Perhaps it was well for us that smaller cares ceased not at the coming of the great; though they were felt with double annoyance. My father sat before the fire one morning early in December, with a most perplexed face. “I do not know how I am to manage,”—he said at length,—“I do not know.” “Manage what?” said my stepmother. “To raise a hundred dollars immediately. Here's this man McCarthy going somewhere—back to Ireland I hope —and wants his money, says he must have it; and where it's to come from I don't profess to know. I could pay him by degrees, but that won't do; and how to get so much at once—unless—” and he paused. “Unless what?” “Unless I raise it upon some of our plate.” Mrs. Howard looked grave. “But for Kate and Grace, I would say yes, in a moment.” “I know—that is the only doubt. But I shall have money by and by, and then we can redeem it,—I should lodge it with some friend.” “Pray don't think of us papa!” said we both, and Kate added, “You know papa what does it signify? so long as your way is made easier—that is the best thing for us.” “It will be in the end, I trust,” said my father. So our company tea-set was packed up and taken to Philadelphia, and McCarthy received his money. But I think we all felt the poorer for this transaction. It might be long before we should need any thing better than the service we had in use,—we had the right to redeem the pledged one at any time,—but when should we have the power? At what future day should we have a hundred dollars to spare?—and for what we could do without? We were like to have more than one hundred engaged beforehand. Things were changed. Our fine English live-stock had dwindled—some sold, others dead; and those still on hand were all too many for the hay. Just in the mowing season Ezra Barrington had been ill and my father away— the consequences we were now meeting. Our Yankee would come in with, “Squire to home, Mrs. Howard?” “Not yet.” “Ain't an airthly thing for them critters to eat; and they're as hungry as can be.” And Ezra would place his hat upon the floor and straighten himself up as if he were supposed to be at his wits' end—not at all as if he was. And with a passing shadow on her face my stepmother would look up and say, “Is all that hay gone already?” “Ain't three straws left, ma'am, if I was to take a rake and count 'em; and the cows is eatin' the mangers. They do put away the most fodder!” he added with a shake of the head—“there ain't no sense into it.” “Well what will you do? Mr. Howard is not coming till Saturday.” “Then 'twon't answer to wait for him, that's a fact,” said Ezra. “I s'pose I'll just have to make tracks to Squire Bulger's, and back down a couple of bundles—ain't snow enough for the sled. That'll do 'em till Saturday I reckon; but it beats all my wife's relations to be scant o' hay afore Jinooary.” We longed for the spring and its supply of grass. There were other things too—for the house, for ourselves,—things wanting and not got. A pair of shoes “if it should be convenient to get them,”—or sheets and towels with a conditional “never mind.” Still my father always said “Have everything you want,” or, “Shall I bring you some silk dresses.” But we knew better, and while so many dollars were needed elsewhere, we could not bear to use any for ourselves. Sometimes we did question whether the money was going in the best direction; but if improvements were not finished, how were we to recover the dollars which had begun them? how ever get our heads above water unless the mill set the example? And then we did enjoy things when they came; and when my father said “there are your shoes, my dear—I hope they will fit,” I felt even tearfully, the kindness that had found time and means to get them. And when after a long waiting he would bring home some needed piece of stuff, we set to work upon it with much more alacrity than if it had come at our call. Yes, there are pleasures in poverty; and the very appreciation of my father's trouble of mind lightened all things else to us. So we worked away, smoothed down all things to him, and kept them from every other eye and ear. By dint of carefulness, our nice clothes long kept their good appearance; and though people knew we had had losses, they were far from guessing how nearly it was low water with our dollars. While we said privately, “Oh filling out, oh filling in! Oh paying out!—no paying in!” And so amid the changing light of doubtful weather, that year which had seen the end of so many things, drew near its own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. The cherished fields Put on their winter robe of purest white. 'Tis brightness all; save where the new snow melts Along the mazy current. Low, the woods Bow their hoar head; and, ere the languid sun Faint from the west emits his evening ray, Earth's universal face, deep hid, and chill, Is one wild dazzling waste. Thomson. CHRISTMAS day passed in whirlwinds of snow; and we within doors were doubly quiet for the sporting elements without. Our few simple presents were given and received with a mixed pleasure. There had been doubts whether we should receive—whether we could afford to give; and to make much preparation we had wanted both time and spirits. Then there was the strong contrast with former years,—how keenly I felt it when Mr. Howard came in with a paper of candies, and laying it on the table, said he had brought us that for Christmas! I would rather he had forgotten the day. Towards evening the wind lulled, and though snow-flakes still fell doubtfully and at intervals, Kate and I resolved to walk to the Bird's Nest. We seldom went by the high road now, it was too roundabout a way for our frequent visits; but we had struck out a little foot-path which going across wood and meadow brought us to the Nest much sooner; and though its narrowness left our dresses to take the benefit of the snow, it was too pretty to be abandoned for such a trifle. So literally this time, we “made tracks” for the little path which fell into our own garden ground. The weather was quiet, except as now and then a puff of wind would sweep over the white country, and put first pearls and then diamonds upon our eyebrows and lashes,— then whirling away—its course marked by the light white cloud which it raised. The chickadees were in full force, and they alone broke the stillness: while their black caps told as beautifully upon the waste of snow, as their merry notes amid the universal hush. We stopped to look at them. Upon a bush close to our path there were perhaps a dozen—in every variety of attitude and position; the little black heads turned up, and down, and sideways; and having from their round, full-feathered plumpness, a look particularly comical. While one bird was perpendicular, another horizontal, one perched and another swinging beneath a branch, their heads never at rest; and from every twig in succession came the joyous “Chick-a-dee-dee-dee!” And all the time their little gladsome eyes watched us—half as it seemed in curiosity, half in commiseration that we too were not Blackcaps. One might have fancied that they sang, “Chick-a-dee-dee-dee!— O see! O see! Wouldn't you be, wouldn't you be, Like me? like me?— Chick-a-dee-dee-dee!” I think if they had really put the question Kate and I might have answered “yes”; but with a chirp, and a flutter that showered the snow from its resting-place, the flock sprang to their wings—if I may use the expression—and we silently walked on. It was time; the light came more and more askance, and neither for birds nor bad walking must we loiter now. Yet fast as we step it is not so light that we cannot see the glimmering fire through the white muslin curtains as we reach the cottage. “How those curtains look like Miss Easy!” said Kate, —“simple, pure, and quiet as she is.” “And transparent to `the light within,'” I added. “Yes,—I wish every one had as bright a light, and as gentle a medium for it to shine through. But then the world would be too pleasant. Ah Gracie! we shall not see many such this side `the kingdom.' How evidently she is bound for it! how plainly the expression of her face tells which way she is looking!” The cottage was deprived of its green setting, and to the rough stone walls the snow clung in patches, and the roof bore its white burden with very grave quietness: yet the many little tracks upon the walk where no other feet had yet been, told of the revels of chickadees; and the elm waved its long branches not cheerlessly in a late gleam of sunlight, which came from the west, a very “beam of tranquillity.” We had long given up knocking at Miss Easy's door; so opening it gently, Kate and I passed in and entered the parlour. The room had that soft, uncertain light—the interregnum between sun and fire—which is the very atmosphere of dreamland,—even the fire seemed weaving visions, as it flickered and flashed and sighed and had the conversation all to itself. Nobody heeded it; and the bright coals fell and the white ashes gathered, and nobody heeded them. Miss Easy was not there, but a great chair stood before the hearth, and in it was Mr. Rodney. We recognised him at once, though with his head sunk in his hands, he sat like one whose thoughts are travelling painfully the long-quitted roads of former life; but after one glance at him Kate and I looked at each other—yes, it was Mr. Rodney himself. Wolfgang lay near him, but the dog's pricked-up ears were quickly lowered, and his tail gave us a quiet greeting as his head went down to its former attitude of repose. We stood still a few moments, and then were about to go as softly as we had come, when Miss Easy entered by another door. “Why my dear girls!” she said, “where did you come from? I am so glad to see you, yes. And you took this long walk in the snow to wish me a merry Christmas? But what in the world were you going away for?” “Not because of me, I hope,” said Mr. Rodney, as he came forward and gave us a greeting that had all the warmth of old times. “Friends should not run away from each other after so long a separation,” he added more sadly. “Don't they look well?” said Miss Easy, coaxing the fire into a bright blaze and then coming back to untie our hoods,—“don't they look well? and haven't they grown and improved?—yes.” Mr. Rodney smiled— “They certainly have, Miss Easy, and they look well; but—is nothing the matter at home? is all well there too?” “Yes, perfectly,” Kate said; and I looked up rather wonderingly and asked, “Why? Mr. Rodney—what makes you say that?” “Something in the eyes I was looking at, Gracie,” he answered; “but perhaps the shade was in my own.” “There mustn't be a shade in anybody's eyes,” said Miss Easy,—“I am so glad to see you all here together, once more!—yes. And now Katie love, sit down and tell me how you have spent this long stormy day; yes—I want to know.” “The day has not been so very long, Miss Easy—considering its quietness and the little Christmas feeling that I have had,—we were too busy to do much in the way of present-making. But your engravings looked like Santa Claus, and gave us a great deal of pleasure.” “And you see what a present I had,” said Miss Easy looking with glistening eyes at her guest. “I found him here this morning just as you did this afternoon, yes; and I have hardly recollected what the day was. And only think! there lay Wolfgang at his feet, and he hasn't stirred from him since. I declare,” said Miss Easy wiping her eyes, “it quite touched me.” Mr. Rodney laid his hand upon the dog's head, which Wolfgang acknowledged by one of his looks of mute affection, and for a little the fire crackled and blazed unheeded as before. Then our two friends spoke again, in tones low at first, and very grave, as if each read the other's thoughts; but brightening and strengthening as word and eye almost, passed from the ruins of earth to “that city which hath foundations.” And Kate and I, listening with charmed ears, noticed not the waning light, till Miss Avarintha and candles came in, —then we started up in surprise at our own forgetfulness. “Now just sit down!” said the lady, “I didn't know you were here, and I've twenty things to say to you. Are your father and mother in health?” 8* “Yes ma'am,” said Kate, “but we must take another time to hear the twenty things. We have staid too long already—it is quite late.” “You need not look so anxiously at the window,” said Mr. Rodney—“you will not be afraid with me, if it is a little dark.” “No, but we are not going with you, Mr. Collingwood,” said Kate—“at least you are not going with us. We are not at all afraid—it is not far.” “O no!” I said; “and you must be very tired—you cannot want a walk, Mr. Rodney.” “I am sure I shall take one, whether you let me go with you or not. I must go to the Lea to-night, Miss Easy,” he added, turning to her, “but you shall see me again in the morning.” “Why should you go there, of all places?” said Miss Bain—“it will only make you feel sad,—you ought to stay here and get up your spirits. It isn't right to indulge yourself so—a pensive state of mind is very unhealthy.” No one answered this speech, but after a minute's silence Miss Easy said, gently laying her hand on his arm, “You will come back to-morrow? yes, you promise me that? then I will not keep you longer, for I know these children want to be off.” And Wolfgang roused himself to follow us, keeping close to his master as if he feared another separation. The clouds were scattered now, and the new moon's faint light just served to show the snow's full beauty. My thoughts went back to our first Christmas in that region—when we had dined at Daisy Lea, and had walked home in such a night—but how different! Perhaps Kate's mind had taken the same course, for after a while she said, “It is strange that the snow cannot keep its lightness, even where there has been no heavy weight to press it down!” “And what reality were you looking at through that shadow?” said Mr. Rodney. “I was thinking of a time years ago, when we said the newfallen snow was like our own spirits,” said Kate with a scarcely perceptible sigh. Again we walked on in silence, and then Mr. Rodney said, “You have told me nothing of this long year as it has passed at Glen Luna. I know from Miss Easy that you have been well, but what have the months brought besides health?” “A little experience—a little more of real life than we ever had before,” Kate answered. “The shade was not all in my own eyes then.” We had taken the road home, for the little path was too narrow and dark for pleasant walking at that hour; and now we were passing the same slopes and fields that we had first seen in all the luxuriance of summer dress. Unbroken white now, the bare trees cast the faintest of shadows, and almost looked shadowy themselves in that pale light. “Miss Kate,” said Mr. Rodney, “the snow will as you say lose its lightness—will melt away entirely; and yet the earth is thereby much more fertilized than if that reflector for the sunbeams were abiding.” “Yes,” she answered, though her voice trembled a little, “I know—I feel that to be true. And yet—” “And yet,” he said gently, “sometimes you forget what Baxter says—`there is no mirth like the mirth of believers, which faith doth fetch from the blood of Christ, and from the promises of the word, and from experiences of mercy, and from the serious fore-apprehensions of our everlasting blessedness.'” “Forget it because I have so little of it,” Kate said presently. “Well,” he answered, in the same pleasant, encouraging tone, “it is something to know what we want,—it is more to know how the want may be supplied; but the arch will fail of its purpose without the key-stone. Let faith bind the remedy to the need, and the work is perfect. The lack of this makes many a half-way christian; and it often hinders the realization of that promise—`They that fear the Lord shall not want any good thing.'” “Will you come in Mr. Rodney?” said Kate as we reached our own door. “Not to-night.” “You have done us more than one kindness by taking this long walk!” “And you are not going away any more!” I said. “I am so glad!” “We will not talk of that now, Gracie, but I trust your power of remembrance could stretch over more than one year—if I should try it.” I was not quite satisfied with the indication of these last words; and when Miss Bain paid us a visit next morning I repeated my remark about Mr. Rodney's staying at home. “Bless me!” was the somewhat disdainful reply,—“the idea of his doing anything half so wise!” “And what foolish thing does he mean to do?” said Mrs. Howard. “Why—of course that's as people take it,—but here he's just come home in great affliction—or ought to be—and instead of visiting about among his friends and trying to get his spirits up—taking a little relaxation you know, Mrs. Howard—he's going straight off to college or somewhere; and the next thing I hear will be that he is dying of a pain in his chest, or some other mathematical disorder.” “I hope not,” said my stepmother, quite unable to repress a smile. “But Mrs. Howard,” said Miss Avarintha—“really ma'am you ought not to laugh,—just imagine him bending all day over his books—and he a young man of such erect carriage and symmetrical proportions! Why it's perfectly melancholy!” “Very melancholy indeed, if it injures his health; but I should think he had sense enough to guard against that.” “My dear ma'am he hasn't a bit!—he told me gravely this morning that he had no time to lose, or throw away, or something—complimentary to his friends too, as I said. Just think of it!—and he so young too! why he might settle down and get married and study for a profession afterwards.” “If he cared nothing about his wife.”— “If he did! Now Mrs. Howard were you ever married to a man who hadn't been through college? and Mr. Rodney has been part through, besides.” “Never,” said my stepmother laughing,—“Mr. Howard graduated with all the honours. But I must venture to assert my opinion that a man had better study before marriage than after.” “Why? for pity's sake?” “More time and fewer claims upon it.” “You don't mean that people oughtn't to read nor anything of that sort after they're married?—why there's Mr. Howard spends hours and hours at his books, I'm sure,— didn't you say so once when I asked you? Why if a man did nothing but look after his wife, what would become of his mind ma'am?” “His wife's mind might oftener become something than it does now,” said my stepmother. “But I am no advocate for idleness in any department, Miss Avarintha; though I must say that I think intellectual men often slight too much their non-intellectual duties. They are so busy making a clear way for their heads, that the walk of their practical every-day life becomes sadly encumbered.” “Then what would you have Mr. Rodney do?—suppose his health fails.” “I'm sure I was laying down no rules for Mr. Rodney,” said Mrs. Howard. “No ma'am—of course! but I want your opinion—young men in general, for instance.” “That's a pretty large for instance. I think `young men in general' are in no danger from over application to anything—the more they study the better.” “My dear Mrs. Howard! you really are too evasive. Should a man give up his books when he gets a wife?” “By no means; but he should see to it that they are not obstacles in the way of his wife's happiness.” “As if they could be!” said Miss Bain indignantly, for she was lady-patroness of books in general—“why Mrs. Howard, I have always maintained that you were the happiest woman in the world, because Mr. Howard was so fond of study and all that! A pretty life a woman must lead when her husband's head is nothing but a head! It had better be something else and be in the clouds.” My stepmother's smile was quite beyond Miss Bain's comprehension, neither was it explained, but she said.— “We are talking in the abstract, you know: if you apply all my words to myself, I shall have to stop. But I have seen many a married student, and have seen him— with his head in the clouds as you say—go stumbling along over the obstacles which had accumulated through his abstraction, and hardly know what they were or how they came.” “Very well, and what harm then?” “I did not say harm to him; but Miss Avarintha I have seen his wife trying to remove those obstacles, or with her own unassisted strength to get herself and her children over them. I can tell you it is a sight which might almost disgust one with books in general! Let a man study—but oh let him study his wife first!” The eye that was so seldom roused out of its gentleness, —the sympathetic, womanly indignation that flushed her cheek and made her voice tremble, obtained for my stepmother even Miss Bain's respect and admiration. “Well I must say,” she remarked, “you are a most extraordinary person! But do you ever tell Mr. Howard all this?” “Sometimes—when I think he's in danger,” said Mrs. Howard with a smile so sweet and placid that it turned the edge of Miss Bain's curiosity. “Bless me!” said that lady suddenly coming back to the starting point,—“why if Mr. Rodney heard all this he'd kill himself right away!” “I hope not,” said my stepmother as with one quieting long breath she too came back,—“I certainly have advised no such desperate measures.” “No ma'am, but he wants to know so much you see; and if he thought this was his only chance, it's my belief he'd study himself to death in six months.” “Maybe he does not intend to get married so soon,” said my stepmother smiling, “and if a few more months dilute the poison, it may not prove fatal. And you may tell him from me, that instead of having no chance to learn anything after he is married,—the chances will be so many that he will have hard work to keep pace with them.” “My dear Mrs. Howard! how queer you are!—what funny men and women you would make!” “O she would make such good ones!” said Kate. “Well I believe she would, if everybody was make-up-able into Kates and Graces—for you are certainly the best girls I ever saw in my life. But now you're coming to dine with us to-morrow, and you musn't say one word of all this.” “I will be very good,” said Mrs. Howard. “Because you see Easy's very anxious—and so am I of course—that he should rest himself; and he thinks so much of your sense and all that, Mrs. Howard, I'm sure he'd do just what you told him to.” My stepmother shook her head, as if she were sure of no such thing. “Who will take care of the Lea now?—Mrs. Crown as usual?” “O dear no!” said Miss Avarintha, “Mr. Rodney has nothing to do with it now, you know,—it belongs to his brother—Carvill Collingwood. At least he was Carvill Collingwood, but he only calls himself Carvill at present.” “A good riddance!” said my father who had come in while she spoke. “Yes, sir, so I think—I can't say I'm fond of very long surnames,—one or two syllables is plenty.” “But I didn't know this brother was alive?” said Mrs. Howard. “Dear me yes! Very fine young man too, only wild— but that one can't help.” “I shouldn't think he would care to live at the Lea then,” said Kate. “Not going to, my dear; oh no—he'd think himself buried alive. He'll only come down there now and then to kill the birds his father was so fond of. Mr. Rodney will take away all that belongs to him at once, which isn't very much to be sure; and what Mrs. Crown will do I am not informed—probably she will choose to reside somewhere in the neighbourhood, and perhaps she'll stay at the Lea house still, if Mr. Carvill makes it worth her while. But that's not likely, for these harebrained young men never know what to do with their property. Easy's quite troubled to think of the old place going into such hands, but I tell her it's no use.—I daresay he'll be a delightful neighbour and wake us all up.” “I don't wish to be waked up,” said my father knitting his brows and walking out of the room. “Mr. Howard is so strict,” said Miss Bain laughing. “But Mr. Carvill is going to be married Kate, so you needn't even look that way. Bless me!—what a face! why he's not a Turk or a Mussulman, child,—and if he was, I'm sure the Turks are very handsome, and turbans very becoming. I can tell you there's many a girl would jump at Carvill, for as wild as he is.” “I am not at all allied to the kangaroos,” said Kate. “But who is the jumper in this case Miss Avarintha?” said I. “Jumper!” said Miss Bain in high indignation—“what in the world is the child thinking of!—kangaroos indeed! the idea of calling Clemence St. Cloud a jerboa!” “Nay we did not touch upon that species,” said Kate, “she is French then?” “To be sure she is, so you'd better not laugh at her. She's a most exquisite young creature they say—brought up in a convent,—so I suppose she knows everything.” “Well but is she coming to the Lea too?” said my stepmother. “Bless me, ma'am, how can I tell?—no I should think not,—from all I hear of her she's not the sort of person to run about after her husband.” “Only to jump at him,” said I. Miss Bain had half a mind to be vexed, but we laughed so heartily that she could but laugh too, protesting that we were “as ridiculous as possible;” and so we parted in good humour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. Something like home that is not home is to be desired; it is found in the house of a friend. —Temple. I FEAR there was a touch of selfishness in our feelings next day, when we heard that Miss Bain had a headache. Miss Easy and Mr. Collingwood were alone in the little parlour, and the explanation of this circumstance was, truth to say, very satisfactory: we could be sorry for the invalid but not for ourselves. So long as we were very bright, her company and conversation came not amiss; but in those circumstances where the tongue—“that little horse that is perpetually running away,”—requires the guiding hand of nice feeling, at the very time when Miss Easy was most lovely, Miss Avarintha was least endurable. Moreover when dinner was served, I discovered that she would have been too many in another respect. We were such a pleasant number as matters stood,—mamma and I on one side, Mr. Rodney and Kate on the other: my father armed with the carving knife; while opposite to him sat Miss Easy with a face of such pleased affection, that none but those who knew her well, would have guessed that she had always at least one thought upstairs. I felt reproved for my secret joy every time I looked at her—get rid of it I could not. An acute observer who had surveyed that happy dinner table, would have thought none of us in exuberant spirits; and yet would have judged that we were possessed of as much comfort, of as much counterbalancing good, as man needs to bear the evil patiently,—and so we were. The wind went noisily about the house, as it had been the world's turmoil: dark clouds that would have done honour to November's moodiness drifted in close order across the sky, like threateners of our peace. Yet did not the world enter, nor the darkened light without do aught but brighten the world within,—we were very happy. Quietly, soberly, as people who have tasted life must be, to be happy at all; though with Kate and me the taste was half sympathetic, and in return the older members of the company caught from us somewhat of the smack of young pleasure that yet lingered on our lips. “Sous les aimables lois dont l'amitié nous lie; Et les biens et les maux, tout doit se partager: Mais quel partage heureux! le bien s'y multiplie, Et le mal y devint leger.” There is something very fair in the unbroken glow of a summer day; but fairer yet, and of more interest, is that play of light and shade when the sun cannot quite banish the clouds, nor the clouds refuse to admit his influence. When the shadows that fall are soft and fleeting, and every touch of light is burnished by the strong hand of contrast. My stepmother went to see the sick lady after dinner; and leaving my father and Mr. Rodney to finish their conversation, Miss Easy walked into the drawing-room again, followed by Kate and me. The short day was just ending; but as if to make amends for its past cloudiness, the sky was now perfectly clear, and the wind had gone after his playthings. “How long does Mr. Rodney stay, Miss Easy?” said Kate. “He goes to-morrow.” “To-morrow!” We watched the passing light almost in silence; but when the sun had set, and we were looking for darkness, there came through the bay-window a strip of the fairest, softest radiance, that ever fell upon a twilight world. It glimmered faintly upon the window, but within—upon carpet and chair and wall—the ray had not even that approach to gayety,—it breathed the very spirit of pure consolation. We looked at each other and then at the western sky. There hung, just over the horizon, a slender crescent, coming forth from the cool white light of the sky most beautifully—like a diamond in silver setting; and from point to point, faintly mapped out, the eye could just trace the outline of its future greatness. Steadily it shone in upon us in its descent, and for a while we watched it almost as steadily. “My dear Kate,” said Miss Easy then, “what are you thinking of? the moon?” “No ma'am, my thoughts had descended to earth.” “Come here and let me see you.” Kate left her stand at the back of Miss Easy's chair, and kneeling down at her feet lent her face to her friend's kind and somewhat thoughtful scrutiny. “Well dear Miss Easy,” she said, “can your mind find the path by which mine came down? I don't think I could direct you to it.” “Tell me where it came to and I will try,” said her friend smiling. “Katie, your eyes are just like the channels about those islands Mr. Rodney was telling me of—only there are no hidden reefs.” “What islands?” said Kate laughing. “The Bermudas.” “Was he telling you about them? O I wish I had heard it. I wanted very much to ask him but”— “Wanted to ask me what?” said the gentleman in question as he came up and placed himself in Kate's former position behind Miss Easy. Kate hesitated. “I was thinking—I was wishing that I could ask you— that you would tell us something about Bermuda,” she said in rather a low voice, as if afraid of giving pain. And to that he answered. “I love to think of it Miss Kate—it is very pleasant to me. What was your question?” “Sit down here Katie and tell him,” said Miss Easy, “I am going upstairs.” “I don't know enough about it to ask questions,” said Kate as she took the offered chair, while Mr. Rodney left his stand for one by the mantelpiece; “I have just a general idea of a group of islands east of the United States. Are they remarkable for anything?” “Very remarkable, both for beauty and situation. You are so fond of this little inland lake Miss Kate, what would you say to a lake in the midst of the ocean?—its boundary a coral reef, its horizon one low water-line. Well Gracie —you look at me as if I were telling travellers' wonders, and not very credible ones neither.” “Because I can't quite understand them sir. Was there ever such a place?” “There was when I came from Bermuda—the islands lie in just such a one. It is a singular shoal, some twenty-three miles by thirteen, the deep sea on every side of it, and the nearest point of land almost six hundred miles off.” “And the lake is on top of this shoal?” said Kate. “Precisely. And the reefs which surround it are so high as to keep out entirely the action of the sea.” “And how near to the islands is this reef?” “The outer edge of it? The distance varies very much —ten miles off in some places. The islands are low and always green—indeed there is no climate there but of spring —it is one of the prettiest evening scenes you can imagine; and the little boats go gliding about the narrow channels like a train of fairy things.” “O Mr. Rodney—” I said, “that is just what I wanted to ask—those channels”— “Are among the islands,” said Kate,—“didn't you understand?” “Of course! where else could they be! But Miss Easy said that Kate's eyes were just like those channels— except the reefs—is there anything peculiar about them Mr. Rodney?” He smiled. “They are peculiarly clear and pure Gracie—I presume that is what Miss Easy was thinking of. But do you know that you have a great fondness for indefinite pronouns?” “How have I? what do you mean sir?” “What was the antecedent to your `them'? `eyes' or `reefs' or `channels'? If I had been a stranger to all three I might have been puzzled.” “I know,” said I laughing—“papa talks to me about it sometimes. But then you always understand everybody Mr. Rodney.” “I generally understand you,” he said with a smile. “But it is only by means of this same clearness of the water that the islands can be reached at all. When a ship comes to the boundary a negro pilot takes her in charge, and leaning over the prow to keep close watch of the reefs with which the lake is studded, he guides her safely through the narrow channel.” “It must be a lovely place!” said Kate, who by dint of strong imagination had conjured up a visionary Bermuda in the fire, and was surveying it intently. “I almost wonder you did not want to stay there, Mr. Rodney.” “That could hardly be!” he said with that quick light of the eye which sudden and strong feeling often wrought in him—“that could hardly be!”—then adding more quietly, “if you knew me better Miss Kate, you would better appreciate my love of friends and home.” “But one might make friends—there are plenty of people there.” “Plenty of strangers—that give one as much of a home feeling as does the wild ocean outside the reef! they seemed like a barrier between me and everything that I cared about.” He paused and then said in a lower and graver tone, “Yes, there are people enough there, and in some moods one might, as you say, make friends. But if one knew them all, home is not easily transferrable,—even the eye wearies of strange beauties, and longs for those which if more common are far more dear. I would have bartered all the graceful, unfading loveliness of Bermuda, for one look at the roughest view in this neighbourhood, in the wildest storm that ever bedecked it with clouds and snow.” “And yet—” “And yet I love to think of it now? Yes, very much, but not for the sake of the place itself—there are some associations that can endear anything, and some recollections that are much more gladdening than forgetfulness.” “There are a great many false notions on that subject,” said my father suddenly pausing his steps by Kate's chair; “I am glad they are not yours. In `throwing off' and `forgetting' some cause of sorrow, how often hidden blessings and comfort go with it. While if men would seek them out, they would by and by get on the bright side of the cloud—out of reach of its shadow.” How sadly the shadow was on Mr. Rodney's face for a moment, ere he answered, “I cannot say that for myself Mr. Howard, not always —sometimes I am selfish enough to feel the cloud far too much—assured as I am that to be out of this world, is not, for a christian, to be beyond the pale of all good, but of all evil.” “How many people,” said my father, “look upon heaven as a man whose house is burning looks at the rest of the world,—he must leave his house, but what to do elsewhere? I was struck with that, almost painfully, the last time I was in Philadelphia. `Poor Dr.—' said a clergyman to me, speaking of the late minister of the — St. church! Sir I wondered if the man thought `the promise of none effect'! What a slur upon his friend's faith! What a commentary upon his own! I was happy to know that the former was undoubted.” “You remember papa,” said Kate, “what Cotton Mather says of old Governour Bradstreet—`death seemed rather conferred upon him, than life taken from him.'” “Ay,” said my father, turning off again to his walk, “but it is much easier to see some people's mistakes than to imitate other people's excellencies.” I had a presentiment that the headache would go off by tea-time, and to be sure it did. Miss Bain was not only able, but very glad to take her place at the table, and as large a share as possible in the conversation—to make up for lost time. “What are you going to do?” said my father seizing a time when he thought the subject matter at the other side of the fireplace seemed pretty engrossing. “You don't mean to turn counsellor Mr. Rodney?” “Not `at law,' certainly.” “That's well—though perhaps I shouldn't say so; but it always seems to me as if the atmosphere of other people's quarrels must be unwholesome. But what are you going to make of yourself then? what profession have you chosen?” “That one sir for which a man is least of all self-made— the church.” “But my dear Mr. Rodney!” said Miss Bain suddenly turning round, “the church! I always thought you were a dissenter?” “From what Miss Avarintha?” said Mr. Rodney. “From what?” said the lady, dubiously eyeing her antagonist; “well that is a question! Why the established church of course.” “And what is the established church of America?” he answered with a smile. “Really sir,” said Miss Bain a little piqued, “I did not know that you were in the habit of evading a fair question.” “It doesn't so much matter what he dissents from after all, ma'am,” said Mr. Howard, “if he only lives up to Bunyan's standard. You remember Miss Bain that `Christian saw the figure of a very grave person hang up against the wall; and this was the fashion of it: it had eyes lifted up to heaven, the best of books was in its hand, the law of truth was written upon its lips, the world was behind its back; it stood as if it pleaded with men, and a crown of gold did hang over its head.'” “To be sure,” said Miss Bain half involuntarily. “Well Mr. Rodney,” said my father, “I am glad that such is your choice. I only hope they will build you a church at the other horn of the lake, to keep Mr. Ellis in countenance. We can't afford to lose you permanently from this neighbourhood.” “Ah sir!” said Miss Easy, “that would be too pleasant! Yes sir, I wish I could see that!” The wish and the tone of loving interest were well paid for, if a look could pay. “It would be almost too pleasant a thing to happen, dear Miss Easy,” he said. “I cannot hope to have just the place in the world that I should like best.” There was some wistfulness, some sorrowful feeling, in her eyes for a moment; and then she said, “I will hope it! and if not—it will be better for you,— that is enough.” But we all felt very much drawn together that night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. I do not envy thee, Pamela; only I wish that being thy sister in nature, I were not so far off akin in fortune. —Sidney. THREE months passed by, and how did we stand then?— if standing it might be called. Another piece of plate had followed the tea-set, and another debt had been paid off. Our last city property we had let go, with all the money paid on it, for just the comfort of untieing a weight from our necks. The mill worked not, because some needful machinery we could not buy; so the rest of the works rusted like the money that had been spent on them, and the stream babbled of our folly, for want of other employment. A little more or a little less, and we had been richer. Our cattle were diminished in size and numbers; our fruit-walls done but wanting a gardener to make them productive; while the stone cottages stood unroofed for the following reason. Mr. McLoon had begun to add his unnecessary aid to the discomposing of our affairs: had declared that our selling out cottage lots would be an injury to him, and that he would not give title. He had promised the contrary —but it was not on paper, and he was not fully paid,—so we went to law again. Then came a judgment for the schooling of some poor boy whom my father had tried to educate—a friend took that off our hands. Then another for cattle feed—but that too was settled. Then Mr. Howard decided that he ought not to let Ezra Barrington work for nothing—(which Ezra seemed inclined to do), and that he could not afford to pay him proper wages. So we began to live along with “help” that were no help. Sometimes it was an Irishman who got offended, or a Scotchman who got drunk; or some other specimen of humanity who was light-fingered. Honesty, in all its senses, was never heard of; the best man we had would just work while we looked at him. When my father left home idleness was the order of the day: and we poor women saw it with helpless discomfort. I say we—I was not a woman, hardly was Kate that in years; but sympathy and circumstances did the work of Time,—mowing down spring flowers and ripening the grain. “I shall not keep any servant this summer,” said Mrs. Howard, when she had apparently resolved herself into a committee of ways and means, and had sat thinking long and silently. “Not keep any servant mamma! why we want another this minute.” “Did you ever read Miss Taylor's `I can do without it'?” she answered with a smile. “That's all well enough mamma when you're talking of inkstands and bonnets, but servants are another affair.” “We will try how the rule will bear stretching,” said Mrs. Howard. “It won't bear it mamma—you needn't think it; and you're not able—you are doing too much now.” And Kate laid down her work and looked up earnestly. “We had much better save in some other way, mamma.” “What other? I can think of none Katie. No we will try this; it is much pleasanter than owing money that we cannot pay. Ezra Barrington is to live at the Lea you know, and his wife will come and wash, or do anything else that is needful.” “But how”—said Kate, and she stopped. “How it will look? Yes it will look a little odd, and people will think less of us, but after all our own self-respect is of more importance.” “Mamma,” said Kate, “what do you think of giving up sugar? we could do without that, and it would save something.” My stepmother looked wistfully at the young proposer of such retrenchments. “It wouldn't save a great deal, dear Kate,” she answered —“however, I am willing, but don't tell your father.” 9 So we drank our tea unsweetened, and felt that we were doing something. Nobody knew all this, and few suspected the half of it, for we still kept up a cheerful appearance. Miss Easy seemed quite taken aback by our asking if she knew of a place for Caddie. “Why dear me!” she said, “yes ma'am, I thought you liked her so much.” “I do like her,” said Mrs. Howard smiling, “but I don't want her.” Miss Easy looked perplexed. “I am going to try how we can do without servants.” “Without any servants?” said Miss Easy. “Yes,” said my stepmother smiling, “I want to economize a little—I think we ought to do all we can for ourselves.” “Yes ma'am, to be sure—dear Mrs. Howard I feel as if I must do all that I can: but you cannot do more than that, —you cannot indeed.” “Ah but you don't know us yet, Miss Easy,” I said; “we can do a great deal when we set about it.” “Dear Gracie, yes, I do know,” said Miss Easy—“I am sure you can do a great deal, yes. But Mrs. Howard is this really necessary? it seems to me, yes ma'am, that you're doing too much now. And you don't know what it is to be without anybody—I shouldn't think you could bear it. It's well enough for strong country women that are used to it, but you—and these girls—” Mrs. Howard looked at us half in sorrow half in hesitation. “I do know it all Miss Easy—all that you might say, all that others will say, and still I think I am right. You know unless we can save money enough to finish some of our beginnings they will never be profitable. And it's only for a time,—just now Mr. Howard is so harassed and engrossed with one thing and another, that I would try almost any means of relief; but in a few months all difficulty may be over, and in the mean time a little more exercise will not hurt us.” “No,” said Miss Easy, “not while you can all smile upon it so. But I think I can find Caddie a place—yes ma'am, I will take her myself, and then you can have her back again any minute.” “Is that why you want to take her Miss Easy?” said Kate laughing. “No,” she said with a smile—“not all the why,—I really want her on my own account.” “I intend to send Grace away till we get these matters arranged,” said Mrs. Howard; “she is going to pay Stephanie a visit.” “Are you indeed!” said Miss Easy;—“well I am glad, and sorry too—yes very. I think it will do her good. But dear Gracie how we shall miss you.” “I like to be missed ma'am, as Mr. Rodney says.” “Have you heard from him lately?” said Mrs. Howard. “No ma'am, not very lately. You know that his brother is here?” “Not absolutely come?” “Yes indeed he is, and his wife too. I saw them yesterday.” “And I must see them to-morrow!” “What kind of a person is his wife, Miss Easy?” said Kate. “Not like you dear,” said Miss Caffery with an affectionate smile, “nor like Grace—no not one bit. I don't exactly know what she is like—very different from anything I ever found at the Lea before,” she added sighing. “It quite made me sad to go there again, yes. But Avarintha liked her very much—thought her beautiful, yes ma'am, and so polished. I don't know,” said Miss Easy— “yes—I believe it's a kind of polish that makes my eyes ache, and my heart too.” “Mamma,” said Kate, “if she is such a sort of person it is not worth our while to call upon her—she would not care to see us. And then you know—” “What do I know?” “You know if we are to have no servants we could not ask her here,” said Kate colouring a little. “I should have paid but few visits in my life,” said Mrs. Howard, “if I had waited to feel sure of my welcome; and even if your last position be unapproachable, Katie, we may at least do what we can.” “Quite right,” said Miss Easy, “and you will think so too, one of these days. One never regrets doing a polite or a kind thing, no matter how it is received.” “If this were either—” said Kate. “Now Miss Easy what are you smiling at?” “To see how little you know what is and what isn't, I should think,” said Mrs. Howard. “Something like that,” said Miss Easy,—“yes Katie, it is both polite and kind—to the family.” And there was no more to be said; though as Kate remarked, “her forgetfulness had been very natural,—she had but looked at Mr. Carvill where he had put himself, and that was, out of his family.” The next day we set forth to pay our respects to the new comers. I certainly had none to pay, but the rest did not want to leave me, and I did not want to be left—two very obvious reasons for going. What is there in some exquisitely fine weather to make one feel sad? It was one of those days of which March has a few, that seem to embody the very quintessence of spring,—the sky of the fairest and calmest, the grass in the yellow-green transition, the trees softened with the swelling buds as with the lightest veil of clothing, and showing green or red as flowers or leaves were to come first. In sheltered fence-corners or bank-protected hollows, there were tufts of grass that might have come from the emerald isle itself; now and then a tuft of tiny white flowers—quiet, insignificant little things—that the eye sought and rested upon because it was March and not June. And even one or two bright-faced dandelions, that had been waked up by some extraordinary sunbeam, looked at us smilingly from the wayside. The birds were in a twitter of delight and consultation,—robins and song-sparrows excited each other; and the phœbe's gentle note of reproof, and the crow's loud “caw” of disdain as he sat on a cedar and bowed his head mockingly, neither calmed the spirits nor roused the ire of the warblers,—their dignity was safe bound up in enthousiasm. On one bush sat a committee of fifty robins,—in another, where two sparrows made mysterious darts through the evergreen foliage, there might be the nucleus of a nest. The scarce stirring air was as soft and delicious as if it had been laid up all winter in sachets of satin and sweetness;—but bouquet nor patchouli can approach the unspeakable aroma of early flowers and leaves —that indefinable perfume that spring compounds for itself. And yet as we breathed it in—and breaths seemed all too short in such an atmosphere—the exceeding beauty of everything brought no exhilaration, but rather sadness. It might be the association with other spring days when our hearts were lighter—a mind somewhat out of tone with the season,—it might be that the beauty was too perfect. Perfection of any kind is too near the contrast. So we walked musingly to the Lea house, and there instead of Mrs. Crown and her pleasant white apron we were met by a man in an embroidered cap, which the weight of responsibility, or its long tassel, had drawn very much to one side. Following this gentleman's flourish of head and hand and foot, we were ushered into the room that had been Mr. Rodney's study, and where we had taken off our cloaks on that first Christmas. No study now.—A guitar in one corner, a flute and castanets on the table; a cabinet that seemed to contain more gilding and morocco than letter-press; a large worsted frame with a St. Cecilia who had as yet but one eye and half a nose; a French clock from which the dial-plate looked forth timidly, as doubting its right to be there; and a pistol, Izaak Walton and Dumas at hand for light literature. On a stand near the window sat a beautiful scarlet Lorius, who with his yellow breast-collar, orange bill, and the mingling of green, purple, and violet-blue upon his head and wings looked almost like some gay piece of patchwork. Mrs. Carvill Collingwood—or to carry out my father's “good riddance,” Mrs. Carvill—sat reading in a luxurious easy-chair. No one could have mistaken her for anything but French. A face that would have been handsome but for its haughtiness, was displayed to the uttermost,—not only was a strip of hair turned quite back, but the large black bandeaux had also a retrograde twist, giving full effect to the ear as well as the eye sparklers. A rather pale complexion, and a mouth that might have been educated to sweetness, were kept in order by a somewhat disdainful and self-satisfied little nose. She was dressed in a light summer silk, the skirt of which opening at the waist and stretching away over an embroidered petticoat, spread its soft folds upon the floor for the nestling place of a little King Charles. His gentle, lustrous eyes looked up at us as we entered, but the long ears still lay silkily over the shaggy feet; till his mistress drawing in her own satin slippers, roused him with a somewhat impatient “otez-vous!” and came forward to meet us. It was a doubtful coming forward, too; and the book was still held with one finger for a mark, as if she trusted the interruption would be short. My stepmother's manner was, however, hard to withstand; and Mrs. Carvill relaxed into at least conventional pleasure at our visit, and listened to all that was said with some attempt at interest. “I have heard Mr. Rod-e-ney speak of you,” she said with that deliberate accentuation which the voluble French sometimes give to our mother tongue, and perhaps meaning to explain the long stare with which Kate and I had been honoured. “Qui vive?” cried the Lorius,—“gare! gare! vive les sans-culottes!” “Chut!” cried his mistress impatiently. “It is not me Madame Howard, who teach him such remark—je ne suis point revolutioniste—it is Mr. Carvill.” “Adieu perfide! adieu volage!” sang the bird. “Pain! pain! à Versailles! à Versailles!—Vive le roi s'il est de bon foi! Il y a long temps que je l'aimait. Plutôt la mort que l'esclavage! Ah ça ira! ah ça ira!—Ah la belle France!” Mrs. Carvill's displeasure softened at these last words, which she had doubtless taught the bird herself, and which he pronounced so pathetically that we were all touched; and with no further reproof than a muttered “si bête!” she turned to us again, for the Lorius had seemingly had his say. Stretching out one leg and wing to their utmost extent, he shut up his eyes, gaped, and was mute. “You live here always?” said Mrs. Carvill to Kate. “No—only for the last three years.” “And you never go away—never go anywhere?” “Not often,” said Kate smiling. “But what you do? there is not no societé in this place.” “Liberté! egalité! fraternité!” cried the Lorius. “Qui vive? à bas les aristocrats!” “Cela passe!” said the lady jumping up and opening a door,— “Atanaise! otez cet oiseau et faite qu'il se taise! Well,” she added, coming back to her seat, “it cannot be that you like these person about here—in what you call the neighbourhood?” “Some of them I like very much,” said Kate. “You do not know them yet, Mrs. Carvill,” said my stepmother. “C'est ce que je ne ferai jamais!” said she with a shrug of the shoulders; and with this hopeful remark we “tumbled into a well,” as Dickens has it. The little King Charles had jumped into his mistress's lap, and lay stretched upon the worked petticoat; while Mrs. Carvill passed his long ears through her dainty fingers, and called him “mignon” and “petit aimant” and “mon beau Chevalier”; and the dog just moved his little fringed tail by way of answer. “You know Mr. Rod-e-ney much?” said Mrs. Carvill. “Yes, we have seen a good deal of him.” “And you like him?” “Oh yes!” said we all. Again we were treated to a comprehensive stare; and finding the well rather too deep to be pleasant, we were about to come away, when the master of the house entered. He was a good specimen of strong family likeness combined with a great want of it,—the resemblance in feature and voice being almost nullified by the difference in character; which gave a gay, heartless, matter of course expression, to what in his father and brother had been grave, kind, and full of meaning. He looked good-natured, too— and rather prepossessing, but neither straightforward nor reliable. Salutations so demure that they almost made us laugh, a very quick, keen survey through a veil of carelessness, and Mr. Carvill sat down with a look that said his mind was made up—about something. “Well ma'am,” he said, “I am glad you have come to prove the truth of my assertion that we should have some neighbours down here. Upon my word! I havn't seen— pray Mr. Howard are your daughters a fair representation of the county?” “Really sir,” said my father, who had hardly spoken hitherto, “I doubt whether the county would choose them to that office.” “It ought to, I'm certain of it—Miss Howard is colouring with displeasure that I should even have asked the question. Clemence, where's Louis Quatorze?” “In the other room.” “Why isn't he here?” “I did not want him—he make too much noise, Mr. Carvill.” “What—has he been talking politics? ha, ha, he shall have a bit of cake for that.” “For to have disturbed me?” said the lady raising her eyebrows. “No my dear, for pleasing me.” “When did you see your brother, Mr Carvill?” said my father. “Who, Rodney? I declare I don't know sir,—of course I saw him the minute I landed, but since then—I think it was two weeks ago—an interview with him always stands out in such bold relief, that it's hard to locate it precisely.” “He was well?” “Well? yes I hope so,—rather pale too, now I think of it. Not alarmingly so, ladies—only enough to be interesting,—fatigued perhaps—he's going to be the greatest savant of the age I suppose, so we have a chance of one star in the family.” “Only a chance?” said my father smiling. “Why,” said Mr. Carvill answering him but looking quietly at us, “I suppose you know best—I have seen so little of the gentleman since he was a boy, and then you know,—in the moral firmament of course, but I was speaking of the mental. Can't tell what sort of a star it will be, neither,—Rodney looked prodigiously grave, but upon my soul I couldn't tell whether it was philosophy or mathematics.” “I daresay not,” said my father dryly—“I think it would puzzle any one to settle the question.” “Miss Howard,” said Mr. Carvill rightly interpreting the slight compression of Kate's under lip, “is the honour of amusing you due to Rodney or to me?” My father saved her reply. “How do you like this country life, Mr. Carvill?” he said; “it must be a novelty at least.” “Yes sir, and that's a charm it shall never lose. It was a dull season in town and so I just came here to see what wanted doing for September. You don't suppose I'm keeping this place for anything but a shooting lodge Mr. Howard?” “I did hope so,” said my father. “My dear sir! a man of your sense and experience to imagine such a thing! Live here? why I'd pocket the whole concern in five minutes, if I didn't want to bag the birds separately.” “As to sense and experience, Mr. Carvill,” said my father, “men with more than I pretend to, have not only imagined such a thing possible, but have actually done it.” “O you mean my father,” said the young man; and for a moment there was a shade upon his face that quite came in aid of the family likeness,—then shaking it off he said gaily, “All right in the abstract sir—I can comprehend how Rodney thinks you such paragons—but you are wrong as regards me, I assure you,—I never was meant to live at Daisy Lea. In the first place I have some little regard for my wife's liking and a most tender one for my own. Now I do suppose that brother of mine could establish himself here, and probably,” said Mr. Carvill speaking slow and as if he were contemplating possibilities, “probably he might find all the society he would care about. But as for me— well, I couldn't exist—that's enough. I shouldn't have lived through these five days but for my precious Lorius, whom my wife has consigned to temporary banishment because he's a little too much of a republican.” “I am afraid our neighbours would share that fault with him,” said my father—“perhaps some of them may have a trifle more education.” “Everything in proportion you know sir,” said Mr. Carvill. “Don't despise the neighbourhood at all—leave that to my wife—like it very much—Squire Suydam especially, fine old gentleman enough,—but as to living here! bless me, I'd shoot myself first—would indeed, as gladly as I'd shoot a woodcock.” “I have just been wondering,” said Kate, “whether you kill the woodcock for the same reason that you say you would kill yourself—if you were condemned to their habitat.” “Hardly worth while to let 'em live when it takes so little to put 'em out of their misery,” said Mr. Carvill. “You don't mean to say that you like this place Miss Howard?” “No sir, I don't mean to say anything about it,” replied Kate. “Incroyable!” muttered our host. “I suppose you, Mr. Howard, get along by means of your daughters, but how on earth they support life, is more than I can understand.” “You need not try,” said Mrs. Carvill whose cold eye had watched the laugh with which Kate and I indulged ourselves, “it is none of your affair.” “Don't look dismal either,” pursued her husband,— “well it's a comfort to one's philanthropy to know that handsome young ladies can exist and be happy anywhere. I always thought the line about `full many a flower,' was a poetical fiction,—but the man must have had second sight —and have drawn from the Miss Howards.” “It would be hard to prove that anything is wasted sir, merely because God has put it in one place instead of another,” said my father gravely. And with that we took leave, and released Mrs. Carvill's forefinger. “Let us go home by the lake,” said my father; and quitting the field road for a little path that yet was hardly a path, we skirted the bright water, which sent one and another of its tiny waves almost to our very feet to greet us. We sat down and watched them as they came up, each sparkling and swelling with importance, then making its low obeisance, and with a soft word of welcome retiring again behind its fellows. “Kate,” said my father suddenly, “it matters very little to Farmer Collingwood now, that the waves of health and riches rolled from instead of towards him.” She looked inquiringly but said nothing. “Don't you think so daughter? is he any the less happy?” “No indeed papa—the happier, if contrast has any power out of this world.” “And may we not suppose that he looks back upon all the circumstances of his life as the best possible, for him? that his `day and night and summer and winter' (they must succeed each other, Kate) were of just the right temperature and proportion?” “Yes, of course, papa. But why do you ask me?” “Merely because `if these things are so' we may as well take the comfort of them. There is no latitude on this earth my dear, where the sun shines unceasingly, but neither is there any where he never comes: and it is well to remember that `the sailing of a cloud hath Providence to its pilot.'” “But papa you do not answer my question—I do not quite understand you.” “I thought,” said my father with a look of more sympathy than reproof, “I thought Katie, that you both came from the Lea feeling a little sober,—I was afraid the power of contrast had been too strong.” “I believe it had some effect, papa,” said Kate, her eyes filling as she spoke,—“I would not change place with the Carvills for anything in the world, and yet there seems to be a great deal of comfort in the abundance of means— the perfect freedom from all embarrassments.” “I have thought so very often,” said my father. “And never to hear of a judge or a lawsuit—” said I. “Dear Gracie,” said Kate, “don't think of them now,— I am too glad to have you go away for a while beyond their reach.” “Come,” said Mr. Howard getting off his stone, “haven't you sat here long enough? I believe if I am to take the benefit of my own lessons,” he added, “we had better not pursue the subject.” “I am sure we have as much happiness—on the whole —as we used to have,” said my stepmother. “More,” he answered. “For my own sake I would not change places with myself as a rich man.” But there was an expression in each speaker's face, that said faith and sense had many an encounter upon that dearer point—“for the sake of the children.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. I can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse. Borrowing only lingers and lingers it out, but the disease is incurable. Shakspeare. “DON'T think about them”—how easy to say, how hard to practise, when annoyances are in question! Former ones we could in a measure forget; but those new perplexities that ever sprang up by our wayside—could we pass them by without notice? Sometimes—and sometimes we took them up and bare them along with us. “I do not want to go, in the least,” said I when the preparations for my visit were near an end. “Kate is going to spend one day in Philadelphia with you,” said my stepmother,—“you will like to go in her company?” “But I wish she would stay longer—why should she go for one day?” “It will do her good, and we want sundry things that your father will have no time to get,—if he attends that meeting of the — Society.” “Mamma,” said Kate, “was it for that he said his coat was not fit?” “He wants a new one at all events,” said Mrs. Howard, “and I'm sure—I'm sure I don't know how he's to get it just now.” “I'll tell you mamma, let's sell our old cake-basket.” “O Kate!” said I, “you don't mean the one grandma gave us?” “That is the only one that belongs to you and me, Gracie.” “But would you sell it?” “We have another, you know,” said Kate, “and the old one is not a good shape.” “I know—but I love it so much!” “But papa wants this coat.” “Well—” said I sighing. “What do you say, mamma?” “I should say yes, my dear, if it were mine—you must do nothing that will trouble your sister.” “O you must not mind me.” “But see,” said Kate, “perhaps papa will be able to give us the money again before long, and then we can redeem our fruit-knives,—wouldn't you like that as well?” “No—you know I have a great fancy for old things; but let us sell it—papa must have the coat.” So it was settled; and when I went to Philadelphia, Kate and the basket went too, and from the trunk it was speedily transferred to the jeweller's counter. Many a time one wants sympathy when it cannot reasonably be looked for, yet does not the want seem lighter. I know that it was with a feeling almost of impatience that I watched Mr. Jewett, as he turned the cake-basket about, eyed it with some curiosity and some little compassion for the “dark ages” of his craft, and finally remarked, (what business had he to remind me of it?) “A piece of old family silver, I should judge sir,—we don't often see such things now-a-days.” Then came question and answer, and it was worth so much in ready money, and so much in other articles of plate; and the matter ended we left the shop both richer and poorer than we had entered it. The coat took but a part of the money, and for the rest we debated between our fruit-knives and some other things that had long been wanting, but prudence prevailed over inclination. I know not what became of the cake-basket—perhaps it does duty as silver skewers at the table of some millionaire who never heard of scarcity or sacrifice. The coat is long since worn out—the “other things” have disappeared, but the fruit-knives have not been heard of; and Kate and I sometimes say to each other, “our poor basket!—it is almost a pity we sold it; and yet what could papa have done without that coat?” Once more we resorted to such an expedient, and then learned the wise lesson that expedients of all sorts are but poor things—a barter of the reality for the seeming; not only failing to remedy the evil, but weakening the energy which alone can. Once more, as I said, we tried it,—while the ready money from the first attempt yet dwelt in our minds and tempted us;—the proposed articles of exchange were brought down by Mr. Howard when he came for me. It was a selection from our small stock of trinkets, and touched me far more nearly than the cake-basket. I cared little for the things in themselves—in fact they were most of them either worn out, or such as we should never use; but if dimmed and broken, so were not my associations with them. The hands that had touched them, the faces they had touched, I had heard of at least; and these poor little reminders of what had long ago perished, seemed to help both imagination and memory. It signified little that my mother's old watch could not be made to go—it had kept time once, and for her, and the grasp of strange fingers seemed almost sacrilegious. Mr. Jewett shewed no curiosity this time, but his look was methought a little scornful as he tumbled the things about, and then declared he could not say what they were worth, till he had separated and weighed the gold. Even then would I have rescued them had the money been for me! I had enough of expedients. And what did we live on all this while?—partly on driblets of former debts and property, partly on new trifles—a little rent here and a little business there,—not on very much of anything. But Mrs. Howard was an excellent manager in any circumstances, and our neighbours thought our style of living both comfortable and pretty. So it was, had we reached it by some other road; but the enjoyment of many a thing was shadowed by the preliminary “ought we?” or “can we have it?” I realized it all the more, when after spending some time with Stephanie in a happy forgetfulness of money and its long train of difficulties and doubts, I came back to Glen Luna. Nothing had changed for the worse, but my mind once set free, loathed to take up again the old burden of dollars and cents. Neither is there much truth in that favourite maxim with some ladies, that “servants are the greatest plagues in the universe”—a house with no servants is more to be deprecated. However we managed pretty well, for Mrs. Barrington was only too glad to do anything for us, and her daughter Prudence (become 'Dency by a little contraction and elongation) was always ready when wanted. Indeed if for nothing else, they liked to come and tell of the queer doings at Daisy Lea. “Don't it beat all!” 'Dency would say. “Why Mis' Howard, they've sent down the dreadfullest sight of dogs! —and a man that ain't got nothin' to do but mind 'em; and he says when they begin to hunt he feeds 'em on raw meat to make 'em more savager.” I may notice in passing, that during my absence Mr. and Mrs. Carvill had left the Lea, and without returning our visit. “You may as well tell her at once mamma,” said Kate the day after I got home. “Tell me what?” “Poor child!” said my stepmother kissing me, “she don't look as if she could bear much. Why Gracie, have you worn such a face ever since you went away?” “I don't know mamma—I suppose I am tired now: but tell me what?” “Did you ever hear your father talk of his being surety with a Mr. Van Wart for somebody?” “I believe I have.” “Well things have gone so that the sureties are called upon to pay; and Van Wart's son-in-law Jenkinson, has contrived to have the creditors come down upon your father for the whole amount.” “But he can't pay it?” “Certainly not; and they have entered up a judgment, and while you were gone a sheriff came here with an execution upon all our furniture.” “Is that all?” said I with a long breath, and really feeling relieved, for the time. “All!” said Kate—“books, shells and everything! I should think that was enough.” “But they didn't take them,” said I casting a somewhat blank look round the room. “O no,” said Mrs. Howard, “and I hope they will not. But your father was away, and this man Jenkinson came with the sheriff and knocked at the door, and Kate let them in; for we didn't know that we could do otherwise. Your father says we had a right to keep even the sheriff out, and that Jenkinson had no business to come at all.” “And only think!” said Kate, “he had put on green spectacles that mamma might not recognise him! And they went all over the house making a list of everything— silver and all, and I had to go with them. And now they have advertised the things to be sold some day next month.” “And will papa let them?” “Not if he can help it—I don't quite understand what he means to do—get an injunction I believe, whatever that is, till the matter can be tried.” The injunction was obtained; but though a stay of proceedings was in one way a comfort, yet we found the suspense very trying. And the courts were dilatory, as courts always are, and months wore on; and still we looked doubtfully at our indoor possessions, and wondered how long we should keep each other company. Whether all this was made public we could not tell; but as no one ever spoke to us of it, the contrary seemed most probable. From Miss Easy we carefully hid all our troubles, for she had been and was still unwell; and though she would sometimes look earnestly at Kate and me as we sat by her sofa, and sometimes sigh to herself as if she saw or imagined too much gravity in our faces; we generally contrived to be so very bright during the rest of the visit, that she at least did not question us. Miss Bain would certainly have found out all and more than all that was known of our affairs, had she been at home;—but while I was away, she had gone to visit some fourteenth cousin who was as far off in geography as in blood. And with these sayings and doings we came to the last week in August.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. There be some sports are painful; but their labour Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone; and most poor matters Point to rich ends. Tempest. “THEM'S come Miss Kate!” said 'Dency Barrington, as she entered our kitchen one morning while we were washing the breakfast things: “them's all come! and mother said I'd best put right off and tell ye, for likely you'd want to hear.” “Thank you 'Dency,” said Kate, “but what is the news? I did not understand.” “Mr. and Mrs. Carvill Miss Kate—they all come to the Lea last night, and forty 'leven servants! And father went up he did, to see was there anything wanting, and if they would have some of the new wheat ground; and Mr. Carvill said he didn't know nor he didn't care—father might ask Mrs. Carvill if he felt disposed. Father said he shouldn't do no such a thing,—he says he don't believe Mrs. Carvill knows where wheat comes from. Don't it beat all, Miss Kate?” “Why it's rather a queer way of doing business 'Dency.” “That's just what father says—he says it beats the Dutch, he does. There's the most company come!” “Any ladies?” said I. “O I couldn't begin to tell you Miss Grace! Father says it beats him to know where they'll all sleep. Ain't it wonderful how people goes on?” said 'Dency by way of summing up, but we ventured no reply save a grave shake of the head. A few days after Mrs. Barrington made her appearance. “Hope you're pretty smart, Mrs. Howard and Miss Kate and Miss Grace,” said the good woman, who was really one of the best and kindest of our neighbours. “Yes we are very well,” said my stepmother smiling pleasantly; “and how do you do at home?” “My children's all dreadful well ma'am—they never had such health. My husband he's dreadful well too, only he's got a little pain into his shoulder,—I tell him he's getting old,” said Mrs. Barrington, with a pleased little laugh at the idea of imputing to Ezra anything but the most absolute youth and heartiness. “'Taint no particular thanks to anybody, neither, if he is well—if he was some folks he'd be laid up as sure as can be.” “Is he more busy than usual?” said Mrs. Howard. “Why he don't hardly get time to eat his victuals ma'am. To be sure as he says, he always was occupied and always calculated to be, but this beats all. He could see to the farm well enough he says, but when Mr. Carvill's got to be seen to at one and the same time, he don't rightly know which foot to put foremost, he says. And they can't one on 'em find a bird without he shows 'em.” “Mr. Carvill is very fond of gunning,” said Kate. “But don't it beat all Mrs. Howard that he ain't called Collingwood? he can't be the Farmer's own son, likely.” “He took his uncle's name,” said my stepmother. “Do say!” ejaculated Mrs. Barrington—“well of all things! it don't seem nat'ral like for a person to give his child to some one beside. He's a very pretty man too, but it's like nothing else the way they go on up there. And Mrs. Carvill she don't never do a hand's turn, they say; and the dinner ain't never ready till the chickens is going to bed—dear knows when they go! But they say one of the ladies is the beautifullest singer Miss Kate! she's got the loudest voice you ever heard.” “Has she?” said Kate smiling. “That's what they tell me; and Ezra says he guesses it's true, for she's always a singin and never leaves off that he can find out. But my! I think they're all raving crazy there. He goes up most mornings the first thing after breakfast—that is after their breakfast—and when Mr. Carvill sees him he says, `Well, what's to pay now?' he says—`is the cow mad or has one of the sheep got a fit?' Why Miss Kate it's as true as can be.” “I don't doubt it in the least, Mrs. Barrington,” said Kate, whose gravity had fairly given way, “but I couldn't help laughing.” “Well don't it beat all?” said our informant. “One time he went to see about ploughing the clover meadow, and there was a set of the gentry out on the lawn with Mr. Carvill, so they all kinder gathered round to listen, and Mr. Carvill he said says he, `O plough it up by all means,' says he, `but I won't have no winter grain on the farm,' says he—`just plant it with green peas and they'll be all ready for spring,—I'm going to make my fortune raising early vegetables. And Mr. Barrington,' says he, `tell the old grey hen,' says he, `that if she lays in the wrong nest another day, I'll wring her neck off,' says he. And they all shouted so, you've no idee!—my husband said he was a'most mad.” “It is well Mr. Barrington is good-natured,” said I laughing. “That's what I say, Miss Grace: I tell him he's the most good-naturedest soul alive, or he couldn't stand it. Why it's just only this morning that Mr. Carvill sent for him up to the house for nothing at all but to say that he didn't believe it was good for the horses to plough afore sunrise; and then says he, `Mr. Barrington,' says he, `what do you feed the pigs with?' says he. So my husband knew there was somethin coming, however he says to him, `they've had milk all summer, Mr. Carvill,' says he, `and now they runs in the stubble,' says he. `That's just it!' says Mr. Carvill. `Well don't let 'em run there any longer,' says he, `for I'm certain it don't agree with them,—last night the little spotted pig did nothing but squeal,' says he. And Ezra said he had to laugh, though he felt real crabbed too.” This being the last specimen of Mr. Carvill's eccentricity, Mrs. Barrington felt she had no more to communicate, and therefore took leave; and we sat and smiled at each other in a very amused state of mind. “Mamma,” said Kate, “what comes next? ironing, doesn't it?” “Not for you dear—I will iron this week, and you and Grace may take holiday. There is but a handful of clothes.” “No indeed—it is our work and you're not to touch it mamma. Please go and sit down and do what you've a mind to—we don't want your help at all. Gracie won't you call Andy to bring some wood, and I'll put the irons down. Now mamma you know we want exercise and you don't.” “Well,” said Mrs. Howard, “then I will finish mending that shirt—perhaps that is as necessary as anything. I'll tell you what, if your father don't get a piece of cotton the next time he goes away, he will want new shirts very long before we can get them made.” So she goes to her work and we to ours. Imagine a long wood fire (we eschewed stoves) upon whose sticks the flame seems to make little impression, as it curls and twines about them; yet it blazes on, no way discouraged, cheered by the bed of red coals beneath. And here, like good soldiers that face the hottest of the fire, stands a row of irons—cool to the eye, but fast losing their original temperament beneath the mighty power of assimilation. One table is before the window, and another before the dresser; the clothes-basket between, and the clothes-horse “beyont,” as Caddie would have said. And we make passes at the window and dresser, and take as much trouble to smooth a cap and shirt, as if they had been the daily path of their owners. And the basket grows empty and the horse grows full,—and the forestick breaks, and we arrange the fire by turns; and Kate takes her irons from the left end of the row, and I mine from the right. And our faces are a little flushed; and an uncomfortable, soreish feeling in our finger-ends reminds us that hot irons were not always their playthings. Then enter Purrer-purrer, and jumping on Kate's table she seats herself on a small pedestal of warm nicely-ironed pocket-handkerchiefs, and winks with satisfaction; and being dislodged with sundry gentle pats, she takes to the clothes-basket, and purrs forth her eulogium of damp sheets. And I set down my iron, and straightening myself exclaim, “O Katie! don't your back ache? and aren't we glad to have cool ironing days once more?” And she replies, “Isn't it very strange that the Carvills never came to see us?” “Yes, but if they can be so rude they are not worth caring for.” “Not worth caring for, to be sure; but still it would be pleasant to be on other terms with them—seeing who they are.” And then the irons being too cool, I seat myself upon the corner of my table while Kate occupies a like position upon hers, and gently swinging one foot (for mere variety's sake) we look at the fire and make little remarks, till Mrs. Howard calls from the other room, “Gracie, what if we should have a potatoe-pie for dinner?” “O I should like it very much; but you had better make it Kate—you are tired.” “Not more than you are, I guess.” “But wouldn't you rather?—” “Why no child—go off and make it yourself. I'm sure you have ironed more than I.” So I make the pie; and while it bakes we iron the last few pieces, all stamped with the pattern of the basket, and then set our little table even in the neighbourhood of the clothes-horse: for `papa is not at home,' and it is `less trouble' than to carry all the things into another room and then bring them back. And after dinner we dress, and Kate sings at her harp “I had ae horse and I had nae mair,” and then we walk down to the Bird's Nest,—that is Kate and I, for my stepmother is still busy at the shirts. “Well,” said Miss Easy with her cheering smile, “and what have you been tiring yourselves with to-day?” “Not very much with anything ma'am—we have only been using that kind of dumb-bells which are denominated flat-irons.” “If you would only let me know!” said Miss Easy— “you could always have Caddie, yes, just as well as not; but I never can manage to guess the right day. Now why don't you send for her? yes.” “Because it isn't necessary at all,” said Kate,—“it don't do us any harm.” “Not a bit?” said Miss Easy, who had hold of my hand: “why this child is trembling now—yes, all over.” “No ma'am, not all over—only my hands, because the irons were a little heavy.” “And she will work so hard at it,” said Kate; “she irons up all the clothes away from me.” “But it's good for me, Miss Easy,” I said—“it's quite good exercise.” “Not the best, I fear. However there is no doubt a bright side to it Gracie—yes, if I had not seen you tried I shouldn't know you half so well.” “And this is a very gentle trial too,” said Kate,—“only a little bit of real life—enough to keep us from being butterflies. You don't suppose Miss Easy, that those same winged rovers are half so well acquainted with honey secrets as are the bees?” Miss Easy smiled, but shook her head. “It is strange,” she replied, “that we cannot always rest satisfied with God's dealings—they are so surely the best that can be! And yet how I have longed to shelter you two—yes, from every `touch of real life,'—how it has grieved me to see where the touch has fallen! Dear children!—well, there cannot any real harm befall you, and with that I ought to be contented.” We were all silent for a few minutes, and then wishing to bring our friend's thoughts from graver subjects, we detailed Mrs. Barrington's information. “Just like him!” said Miss Easy, “never was such another wild, random-headed boy as he always has been, yes from a child.” “Have you known him so long!” said Kate. “Why my dear, yes; I lived here before they came to the Lea—that was just after their mother's death—and Mr. Carvill and Mr. Rodney were quite small then;—and as they grew older they used to come and get nuts off my great tree, yes, they did indeed. I never liked any so well as those they knocked down for me, and they always got mine before they would help themselves.” “And was Mr. Rodney the same then?” I asked. “Just the same—yes; always ready to do for everybody —always gentle and affectionate—yes. And I don't mean to say that Mr. Carvill wasn't affectionate too, but he was wild and thoughtless, yes very. Yet so long as he staid at home he did pretty well, but then you see,” continued Miss Easy, “when they went to college Mr. Carvill went all sorts of ways; and he's never gone straight since.” “But how could Farmer Collingwood leave the Lea to him?” I said. “He didn't my dear; O no, it was not his—that is, it was his but for life; and then by his uncle's will it was to go to Mr. Carvill.” “And that was the uncle Mr. Carvill was named after.” “To be sure, yes, and they thought all the world of him, yes. But dear me! the farm won't do Mr. Carvill much good at this rate.” “It's well he has an honest man to deal with,” said Kate. “He needn't thank himself for it,” said Miss Easy—“no not one bit; for Mr. Rodney engaged Ezra Barrington as soon as he knew that your father would not keep him, yes. I suppose he thought Mr. Carvill would never take the trouble to turn him out, and that he would not be quite so likely to ruin himself as if he chose his own farmer. But he did not say that to me—he very seldom speaks of his brother's doings, though I believe he's the only person who can influence them in the least. Indeed Mr. Carvill always looked up to him, yes; but in a queer sort of way too—as if he couldn't help it, and they never are on anything but the best possible terms.” “Has Mrs. Carvill ever been to see you Miss Easy?” said Kate. “Why my dear child! yes, to be sure—several times, yes. What put that question into your head?” “Because she has never been to see us.” “Never at all? never returned your visit?” “Never—isn't it odd?” “Very odd, yes, and very rude,” said Miss Easy. “And yet—I don't know—yes, I think I can understand it, yes. Well you are better worth going to see than any people I know, Katie: Mrs. Carvill loses more than you do, dear— yes, much more.” “It isn't quite pleasant though.” “No, not quite; but there are a good many things in this world that are not quite pleasant, yes, very many; and I fear you must find that out, yes, like other people. Even you, little Gracie.” “Even I!” said I laughing,—“why Miss Easy you wouldn't have other people get the start of me in finding out things?” “Ah child!” she said. “But tell me, were you ironing all day till you came here?” “No ma'am,” said Kate, “there was breakfast you know, and Mrs. Barrington; and this afternoon I sang for a while, and Grace studied German.” “Most praiseworthy occupations!” said a voice behind us, and turning round we saw Mr. Ellis—the minister of our little church. He was rather an old man, though Time's assistants had done more than the great innovator himself; but if his head had grown old, so had not his heart, and the smile that now greeted us was almost childlike in its brightness. “Beg your pardon ma'am,” he said, shaking hands with Miss Easy, “but after knocking three times at your door, I thought I might venture to let myself in.” “My dear sir!” said Miss Easy, “knock three times! did you? I am very sorry indeed, yes sir.” “No occasion ma'am,” said Mr. Ellis, “since I've got in, —if I hadn't, we might both have been sorry together. I needn't ask any questions of you young ladies—I hope the half of Mr. Howard's family that is at home, is as well as the half that is here?” “Papa is away sir,” I said, “but I don't know but half the family is at home still.” “Yes, and a large half too—no disparagement to the rest. And how are you Miss Caffery?—better I should think,— and when is Miss Bain coming back?” “I am better to-day, yes sir; and Avarintha expected to be here this week, yes, but I hear this morning that she has changed her mind.” “So, so!—why she seems to like Ashton.” “O she is not there now, she has gone further west.” “But I should think you'd want her here,” said Mr. Ellis knitting his brows a little—“you are not well.” “O yes—but then she's enjoying herself so much,” said Miss Easy apologetically; “and besides, yes, I can hardly 10 want anything while these children come to see me so often, — yes, that makes up for everything.” “And how does Miss Howard like to be called a child?” said Mr. Ellis turning to Kate with a smile. “Very much,” said she smiling in turn. “And are you both learning German?” “Yes sir, we study it together.” “Do you know Italian Miss Kate?” “Only half sir,—I did study it for a time.” “And why not now? what made you give it up?” Kate coloured a little—“I thought it would be of no use to me sir, and I parted with all my Italian books. I have been very sorry since.” “Ah that was a mistake!” said the old man gently,—“a great mistake to suppose that any kind of harmless knowledge could help being useful. And yet it's the very one that many people fall into, just when they ought to be most clear of it,—when they are ranging themselves with those whom the world calls not only fanatical, but illiterate and low-bred.” “And often justly,” said Kate. “Often justly,—that is, supposing of course that you refer to my two last adjectives. Strange! that every Christian should not feel as wrote some old author: `I would acquire all knowledge, I would do whatever could perfect mind and character, that I might lay it all at the foot of the cross.' I may not give the exact words, but that is the idea.” “It is seldom that you hear a clergyman say that,” said Miss Easy smiling; “yes, very seldom.” “Ma'am,” said Mr. Ellis, bringing one hand down emphatically upon the other, “in my opinion clergymen are under a delusion that they don't pay more attention to such things. They should not neglect `the weightier matters of the law'—God forbid! but manners and education may be perfected with little more outlay than of care and attention. Why should a man give people a chance to pour contempt on his message, by delivering it in bad English?—or make his presence distasteful by the want of that nicety of dress and habits, which the world holds in so great esteem? I say not they are excusable for the sneer or the contempt, but such things will have their effect— ought to have; and I do know from experience and observation, that humanly speaking, a minister's christian efforts are greatly furthered by the manners and conversation of a gentleman.” “`Lovely and of good report,'” said Miss Easy. “Exactly ma'am; and lovely as the picture may be in some respects, it will neither be of so good report nor so well appreciated, if the glass before it be dull and covered with dust. Christians should give the world no handle, no occasion of reproach: and therefore Miss Kate I would set very wide bounds to the field of knowledge, and go over it in full career,—being careful always not to encroach upon higher duties. I would not leave all the breeding and manners and education in the hands of the world! let the tide of christian influence be swelled by every harmless auxiliary.” “You would have liked Whitefield Mr. Ellis,” said Kate,—“you know he is said to have been so particular about everything, that even when dining quite alone, he would care for the whiteness of the cloth and the line-and-rule arrangement of the dishes.” “Was he indeed? I don't remember to have met with that; thank you Miss Kate for furnishing me with such a precedent; I am exactly of his mind. But by the way Miss Caffery, speaking of manners and education, when do you expect Mr. Collingwood home? coming for the holidays, isn't he?” “O yes sir,” said Miss Easy with a smile, “dear me, yes, to be sure!—before that I hope.” “Won't stay at the Lea, will he ma'am?” “I don't believe there'll be any one there to stay with; but he'll be here, yes sir, the most of the time.” “Glad of it,” said Mr. Ellis energetically—“I shouldn't see him once a week if he set himself down among those monkeys.” “Monkeys!” said Miss Easy, “why Mr. Ellis, yes sir, they haven't got monkeys there too?” “My dear ma'am they've got plenty of two-legged ones I'm sure: whether any of the real Monboddo progenitors of our race have yet arrived, I can't say. For my part I'd rather see Simon Pure than his imitators. You needn't laugh Miss Grace,—if you'll give me a clear, forcible definition of the difference between a hounuman and some of those French servants—not to say their masters—I'll be obliged to you. And now goodnight Miss Easy, goodnight young ladies, and success to all learned enterprises. A woman's mind is far too good and valuable a thing to be given up to housekeeping. Mind, I say given up,—bread and butter in its place; but keep a place too for `pictures, taste, Shakspeare, and the musical glasses.'”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. I see a column of slow-rising smoke O'ertop the lofty wood that skirts the wild. Cowper. IT was October—with all the peaceful fairness of its blue skies, and all the frosty stillness of its nights; and the dainty colouring of its woodland that might have vied with the Lorius at Daisy Lea. Nor woodland alone; for while the lawn and sheltered hill-side were yet green and unfrostbitten, there was many an acre that shewed brown from the recent ploughing, and many a field where, despite Mr. Carvill's prohibition, his Suidœ yet gleaned among the yellow stubble. The locusts had long forsaken the great maple before our house, and in their stead a few katy-dids began to sing as soon after sunrise as they could get warm enough. Poor things! their slow doubtful “ka-ty-did!” told of cold weather: my father said it quite made his heart ache; though as we laughingly reminded him, it was not many weeks since he would have drowned them all in the Red Sea if he could. As for the dapper little brown crickets, they were facing life bravely; as cheery and hopeful in chirp and gait as if they were nothing daunted by the white frost—nothing doubtful of spending a most agreeable underground winter,—they prepared for it daily. The spring birds had forsaken us, and now came visiters—a flock of robins to breakfast on our lawn, or a little band of ruby-crowned wrens to take a night's lodging in our evergreens. Sometimes too, the sky would be speckled with crows, in numbers that distanced all arithmetic,—whirling, cawing and clamouring as in debate when to go south; or perhaps as to which should go and which stay,—for we were never without some black representatives in our feathered congress. Then came an arrival of my pet black-caps, or a sulky looking butcher-bird; and then another set of strangers that kept me puzzling and wishing for Audubon. Well it was such weather; and Mr. Howard sat looking out at the artemisias and alyssum and xeranthemums, that with the help of mignionette and a late rose or two, kept up their end of the world's progress; and the lake was but another sapphire set in a gold ring of autumn woods; and the wind like nothing in the world but sighs—for the past, for the future—indefinite sighs that come from a heart too full, of it doesn't know what; and my father looking out at all this, drew one breath that was but too definite, and said, “There seems to be no end of weariness and vexation!” “Is anything new the matter, papa?” said Kate. “Why nothing new as to its being weariness and vexation—I have got a further development of the same.” “About what, papa?” “It's not worth while to trouble you all with it,” was the somewhat gloomy reply. “Yes it is,” said Kate,—“if you fold up a black sheet of paper it will look very dark indeed; but open and hold it before our faces papa, it won't be more than grey at the most, and who knows what bright specks may appear?” My father smiled. “Well,” he said, “it would be a dark sheet indeed that your faces couldn't light up. This is not anything so very bad, neither, if it didn't come on top of everything else. But that man Curtis who bought the farm near Wiamee and has been living on it ever since, now says that he can't pay for it, nor even rent for the time he has been in.” “Is this Mr. McLoon's doing?” said my stepmother. “No, I think not, for I had talked with Curtis, and he was quite willing to take my word about the title. But he's very poor he says—I think every man is—and has lost something somehow, and really cannot pay. So that place is still unsold, with a considerable loss of rent.” “But why don't you make him pay, papa?” said Kate, for my stepmother sat silently looking at the little fire which sighed and flickered like our waning fortunes. “Haven't you the law on your side?” “Ay! and there it may stay. The law is an excellent battery for gold and silver, Kate; but it's rather too strong to be played upon poor flesh and blood that has lost its wall of defence. I have suffered enough myself, to feel for others. Curtis told me I might send a sheriff to his house, and make what I could by the means, and that he shouldn't blame me; but I never would visit troubles upon a man's family—I never could; nor upon himself in that way. Let him keep his home if he has nothing else to keep!—hard if losses and law-officers must invade even there! It makes no difference how Curtis has behaved—his wife and children would feel the want of furniture none the less because it went by his misconduct. I never should sleep another night in peace, if I thought I had deprived that poor little dwelling of a single comfort.” I saw the big tears glistening in my stepmother's eyes, and her look spoke a pleasure far beyond gold's bestowing, as she said, “Surely poverty is not always hardening!” “I don't know,” said my father, shaking his head—“I think I'm pretty hard sometimes; but a man must melt a little among such sunbeams. You were quite right Katie —the black sheet has faded,—faded so much that I can even seem to see written on it old Philip Henry's trustful saying—`there is no must be without a needs be.' Ah one's eyes get sadly blinded sometimes! But we'll struggle on a little longer, and maybe win through yet.” “When will that suit with Mr. McLoon come on?” said Mrs. Howard. “I'm sure I don't know,—there it is again; if one could but have things decided one way or another, there'd be some comfort in it. But patience, patience! `Brought safely by his hand thus far, Why wilt thou now give place to fear? How canst thou want if he provide?— Or lose thy way with such a guide?' There is a full answer to every doubt—`Fear not! I am with thee.'” “Come children,” he said after a pause, “brighten up! Aren't you going out this fine day? take Andy and go pick up butternuts.” “What for papa?” said Kate smiling. “What for? exercise and fresh air. Get them child-fashion if you can't any other way. Such weather ought to tempt everybody out.” “Suppose it should tempt you, papa.” “It must tempt me in another direction, Gracie. I must go and see if Squire Brown has any spare hay, and then to ask Squire Suydam to let me have his oxen for a day or two. I have a great mind to tell Barrington to buy me a yoke.” “Better not,” said Mrs. Howard, “you won't want them much this winter, and hay is so dear.” “Dear enough!—if I live to see another season, I'll stay at home and mind my own haying. I might as well have had a pitchfork for overseer as that man McKee.” “I would get rid of him,” said Mrs. Howard. “Can't, my dear. I couldn't turn him away at this season, or at least if I did, it would be hard to get another. O he'll do well enough for the winter—I daresay he means to do right.” “You wouldn't dare say it, if you could once see him work when you are away—or rather not work,” said my stepmother; “and I'm afraid he'll make Andy as idle as himself. If I were you I would send him off, and teach Andy to do what is needful. Get Mr. Suydam to send some one with the oxen, and I presume Mr. Carvill would let you have Ezra for a day or two.” “I presume I sha'n't ask him. If ever I am rich enough I'll have Ezra for good,—I haven't had a bit of comfort since he went away; and as to the rest I'll see.” “But papa,” said Kate, “won't you try to get somebody else? some new man for the winter? McKee is a mere old woman.” Now among Mr. Howard's peculiarities was that of not taking female testimony with regard to man or man's doings—a kind of Salic law of evidence. So in reply to Kate's request he only laughed and said, “Don't libel your sex, my dear—I should be sorry to think all old women were like Adam McKee. But as I told you before, I'll see about it.” My father went off, and Kate and I assumed bonnets and baskets, and with Andy for escort began to thread the woods,—keeping carefully to our own grounds however. Threading it was: the path being sometimes a slight wearing of the rock moss, sometimes a channel-like passage between stones and trees; while the eye caught intuitively those trifling way-marks which the understanding could scarce perceive. The trees hung full of their late honours; and now and then as we walked, a crimson dogwood leaf, or one of bright yellow from some maple, fluttered reluctantly down: loth to quit its free waving station for the low ground, already gay with such trophies. The asters were luxuriant in bloom and variety: the small white flowers of some, and the thick purple clusters of others, forming a bright contrast to the bending golden-rods and erect ladies' tresses. Wintergreens carpeted the ground in spots, loaded with their carmine berries; and bunches of other small fruit— red, white, blue, and purple, hung from cahosh and buckthorn and creeper. Here and there beneath a tall chestnut the open burrs showed that fingers or paws had been busy; while away on the top of some that were exceeding straight and slim, a profusion of well-filled green pricklers seemed to mock us with just a peep of their brown contents. Whatever could climb that slippery unbroken bark, must be more akin to cats and squirrels than was even Andy. “How can you ever find the cows in these thick woods?” said Kate. Every morning I sees where they goes, and then I goes after them,” said Andy displaying his whole set of teeth at the perfectness of the reply. “But see, Miss Kate, there's the chestnuts sure! Och whillastrew! how will I get into it!” And with an insane desire to ascend one of the tall chestnuts, Andy pressed every member into the service, and began to climb—not on all-fours but on all inches. “Andy! come down!” said Kate. “You will fall and break your neck.” “Sure and it's meself wouldn't do that thing,” said Andy, whose limbs were beginning to assume a downward movement that could not be checked, and which soon brought him to the ground with no further damage than 10* the temporary detention of each trousers leg about the knee. “Never mind the chestnuts,” said Kate. “Och, they'll be all on the ground hereafter,” was the philosophical reply as Andy examined his hands. “Then for a tree that had no holt to it, that same was mighty rough!” “Did you hurt your hands,” said I. “Troth and I did not, Miss—that is I did, but it's little it hurts me itself.” We rambled on, gleaning after the squirrels, and sometimes wishing that their purveyance had been delayed a little; but then again we saw such a picture of rural felicity in a fur coat, that there was nothing for it but to wish him health and happiness,—or as Andy said “success to you! and why wouldn't you be afther throwing us down a few!” Chestnuts were not to be had, but at length we came to an old butternut whose white and brown branches stretched their leafless length in the warm glow of a golden hickory. Aloft there was neither fruit nor foliage; but snugly embedded in the long grass and fallen leaves the greenish-yellow nuts lay in great abundance, and were to be had for the gathering. “Be sure I can asy get them!” said Andy, as with a most grasping disposition he threw himself upon the butternuts; and “be sure” we did; and pretty little green heaps soon arose in all directions. Leaving Andy to transfer these to his basket, and to refresh himself with cracking and eating, Kate and I sat down upon a lichened rock, and took in our refreshment at eye and ear. Behind the bit of woodland where we had been nutting was a long stretch of forest trees, with so thick a sprinkling of silver pines, that it went by the name of the pine wood. But it was not an old forest, half a century being perhaps the most that had rolled on since some of the trees were hid in acorns and cones, and others had sprung up from the trunk of some fallen ancestor. Before us lay a strip of greensward strewed with the yellow butternut leaves; then came a clump of cedars festooned with the Virginia creeper in its scarlet dress, and the cat-briar boasting no ornament but its dark blue berries and freckled leaves. Other trees, mingled with grey rocks, feathery tufts of brake, and lively green beds of moss, lured the eye on to where the western horn of the lake lay glimmering and sparkling in the soft light. A black-cap or two and a belated song-sparrow, joined issue with a cock whose hearty crow came to us pleasantly from Mr. Carvill's barnyard, and made the stillness perfect. “How very lovely it is!” said Kate, with that half sigh that comes from the hidden recesses of enjoyment. “But it's getting so hazy—just look,—the air was as clear as possible when we sat down here, and now it is oh how blue.” “We often have hazy weather in October,” replied Kate. “Yes, it is blue enough, the whole landscape seems melting away into dream-land. I shouldn't wonder if I got there myself, with such a lullaby atmosphere around me.” “There's more than lullaby in the air,” said I laughing— “it makes me very wide awake. I don't think that's haze —it looks much more like smoke, and smells like it too,” and jumping up I carefully scanned the sky. There was nothing suspicious in the appearance of south, east or west; but away to the north the blue heaven had as it were the shadow of a golden cloud,—so slight that we thought at first it was only a cloud; but something in the light curl of its outline, together with its steady ascent, soon told the truth: it was surely smoke, and from our woods. Hastily we went back to Andy, guided by the monotonous tap of his stone hammer; and then walked home at a rate which would have left gay leaves and busy squirrels unnoticed, even had our minds been free. But Mr. Howard was yet away. What was to be done? We stood debating the point round the two pleasant-looking loaves of bread that were baking at the kitchen fire, feeling as we had often done before, that woman is very powerless out of her own sphere; and that with so large a place and no one to take care of it, we were in the same predicament as the Vicar of Wakefield's picture,—“we wondered how we should get out—we wondered still more how we had ever got in!” “Squire to home Mrs. Howard?” said a very unfeminine voice, while a corresponding hand swung open the kitchen door. “How do you do Mr. Barrington?” said my stepmother with a brightening face: “we have not seen you in a great while.” “Thank'e ma'am, I'm pretty smart—'tain't my fault neither,” said Ezra in reply to her last remark, “but a body can't be every place. Squire too deep to be spoke to, ma'am?” “O he's gone to Mr. Suydam's,” said Mrs. Howard. “That's just what he oughtn't to ha' done,” said Ezra with a tone of some vexation. “But he'll be back soon.” “You tell him then ma'am to start for the pine wood as tight as he kin put: some o' them 'ere guns has gone off in the wrong place, and the trees is a burning like seventy-five.” “Is that where the fire came from!” cried I. “And why in the world did Mr. Carvill go into our woods?” “It beats me to guess why he does anything,” said Ezra: “I s'pose Washington might ha' telled—I kint. But the woods is afire and no mistake.” “I'll tell Mr. Howard as soon as he comes,” said my stepmother. But Ezra still kept his stand. “The Squire never kin put 'em out himself,” said he ruminating; “and Mr. Carvill” (Ezra never dignified him with the title of Squire,) “is in a takin to know where to ketch patridges—I reckon he'll just have to find out—it goes agin my conscience to let them woods burn. But the Squire had better come too ma'am—there won't be a hand too much,” he said aloud. “And will you help him?” said Mrs. Howard with an immediate feeling of relief. “O I should be so much obliged to you!” “There ain't nobody in the world I'd sooner help,” said Ezra, “and there's some folks I wouldn't nigh so soon.” And with one expressive little nod of his head towards that point of the compass where Mr. Carvill was supposed to be, Mr. Barrington strode off in the direction of the pine wood; admonishing Andy the while to “walk up smart.” Thither too went Mr. Howard as soon as he got home, and with him Adam McKee; so we were left to guard ourselves and the house, and to gather such comfort or discomfort as we could, from the columns of smoke, their size and drift, and from the gradual westing of the sun; which promised no indefinite length of daylight for the labourers. We had talked it all over for the twentieth time, and the loaves of bread stood brown and cooling upon the table, when Mrs. Howard suddenly exclaimed, “They'll be all starved! your father hasn't had a thing to eat since breakfast, and he's been on his feet the whole time.” “And the men can't have gone home to dinner,” said I. “O let's take them something mamma! I should like it so much.” To think was to do; and in a little while we had fastened up the house, and with basket and cup and pail were on our way to the pine wood. The road led us to a cleared field at its very edge; the forest now spurning the open ground with a rude bluff, and now meeting it half way on a slope of gradually increasing smoothness. Here the fire had been left to take its course till checked by the greensward: we could hear it distinctly as it ran along among the dry leaves and undergrowth with the rustle of a snake, and now and then with a quick short sound like the same creature lapping to quench his thirst; while a low, unbroken roar seemed to bring tidings from all parts of the burning district. Tidings of the fire—not those that we wanted. In vain we listened for some other sound—there was not even a chirp: the birds had all flown off in dismay, and the hot breath that came in our faces told of no living presence. We called—no one answered,—there was no labourer there save the fire. And again that same feeling of powerlessness, with a touch of fear, crept over us. “Mamma,” said I, “if you will let me go further down the road, perhaps I shall find them, and then I will come back and let you know. You can rest here nicely till then —you are so very tired.” Mrs. Howard hesitated, but at last gave her consent upon condition of Kate's bearing me company, and we set forth with the basket between us. The road that we took now, was but a half-made one—little more in effect than a broad wood path, but the free access of sun and air had kept it grassy and free from dry leaves. As yet the fire was on only one side, and even there had not come down the hill which rose abruptly from the very road-side: all along the ridge we heard and saw its progress. Now and then a shoot of flame would leap into the branches of some dead pine, and little inverted cones of smoke went up from many a damp or half-burnt pile of leaves. Still no sign of any one, and uncomfortable recollections of falling trees and suffocating smoke began to strengthen in my mind. We walked on, then came in sight of Adam McKee, sitting on a stone and carelessly waving his cedar-bush extinguisher. “Where is papa?” said Kate. “I dinna ken Miss.” “Where's Mr. Barrington?” “I dinna ken,” was again the reply. “The maister said to bide here and tent the fire till he'd come.” Again we went forward, then turned and walked back. “Why child you need not look frightened,” said Kate; “don't you suppose papa knows enough to take care of himself?” “But if he should have got tired and faint, as he sometimes does?” “Not at all likely—and then there's Ezra. O here comes mamma to meet us.” A short consultation determined us to go together as far down the road as we could, until stopped by the young growth of trees and bushes which were fast concealing the unfinished work of so many dollars. Again we reached Adam, and having given him a drink of milk went on and on. Long, and wearily and worriedly: still the road bounded the fire; still were blackened trees, and burning stumps and smoke, our only companions. We stood and called. “Hollo!” came from the distance. We went on joyfully—then stopped disappointed. “Is that you, Ezra?” called Kate. “I used to think so,” replied Mr. Barrington, as he came down the ridge bush in hand. “I reckon I ain't quite myself in this plaguey smoke. I vow! I think the old woman 'ud say I was somebody else!” We were very near saying so too. “Where is Mr. Howard?” said my stepmother. “Land knows! ma'am—he's choking himself some place, I calculate. If Mr. Carvill was one o' them 'ere spouts of smoke, I'd walk into him in arnest, and put him out in a way he ain't been used to!” and stimulated by this idea, Ezra gave furious blows with his cedar bush upon one or two mimic volcanos, whose underground fires seemed spreading. “That had ought to be the Squire,” he said presently, standing up and pointing down the road to a tall advancing figure,—“'tain't as handsome as a pictur neither, but it's dreadful like him.” “Dreadful like him” it was,—coat off, face and shirt black with smoke and the handy-work of charred twigs, a tall cedar in his hand—my father looked like a figure from the Hartz mountains. “O papa!” said I, “you are tired out!” “Pretty near it. There's no stopping this fire,—we may as well just keep it from crossing the road, and where it has got hold, let it burn. Don't you think so Mr. Barrington?” Ezra took a comprehensive view of the hopelessly long line of smoke, and then gave my father a keen glance of his eye that made words quite needless. “But stop and eat something first,” said Mrs. Howard: “the fire won't get down here for a while yet.” My father took off his gloves, and first calling to Andy and McKee, he threw himself down on the grass and opened the basket. “I don't know,” said Ezra, looking at his hands as Kate offered him a sandwich, “my wife says ashes is clean dirt, but I'd like to hear what she'd call t'other! However it ain't no use to starve upon manners;” and he too sat down, remarking that it was “as cheap sitting as standing.” Certainly if our little group was unceremonious it was picturesque; for effect varies with circumstances, and that degree of roughness and irregularity which finds no place within doors, is often the very point of a scene without. A dead tree, a dry branch among fresh ones, are singled out by the eye (at least by mine) with particular pleasure; and in this case it may be questioned whether water and soap would have improved our general appearance. As Carlyle says of some troop, “singly you might have likened them to Don Quixote; in mass, they were highly dignified;” and the smoke had at least the art to throw an air of congruity over what might otherwise have been deemed irregular. For Mr. Barrington, without presuming to take a seat by the Squire, had yet placed himself within speaking distance, and their meal was agreeably diversified with scraps of conversation. The two others sat further off, muttering forth information and remarks with that low, uninterrupted murmur which an American would seldom choose to assume, if he could: Andy's face never losing sight of the lunch basket, and expanding most benignly whenever that was opened. As for us—if they had been in Sunday or even the usual week-day trim, of course we should have stood aloof; but being men in the last degree of smokiness and fatigue, it was equally of course that we should complete the picture and hand them refreshments. My father looked in the basket and saw it was empty, save one sandwich; with a smile he gave that to his next neighbour, took a drink of milk himself instead, and then prepared for business. “The best thing we can do,” said he, “is to fire the leaves at the foot of this hill, and then the flames will run up and leave the road, and we may leave it too, and go home.” He caught up a forked stick, and going to a burning heap, brought thence enough combustion for his purpose, and they were soon fairly set to work to meet the fire half way. As my father had said, the flames ran up the hill, but now and then some slight conductor of dry leaves carried fire across the road, in spite of their vigilance. “Andy!” shouted my father, and pointing to a whiff of smoke on the unburnt side, “there is fire under that hemlock.” “Show me the bush sir, till I squench it,” said Andy, running up to him and away from the smoke, and holding out his hand for my father's extinguisher. “Get your own bush,” said my father a little impatiently, “I can't leave this pine tree for a minute—what have you done with it?” “It's up beyont,” said Andy looking dubious and innocent. “'Tain't the only thing I'd like to see there,” said Mr. Barrington,—“get it, can't ye? and be spry,—the bush 'll show itself afore long, or I'm mistaken. Now Mr. Howard, you just sit down sir, if it's all the same to you—I'll take what knocking up 'll answer for both on us.” “I believe I have got about enough,” said my father, “but I don't know that I am more tired than the rest of you.” “There's some of us ha'n't got enough, by a long jump,” said Ezra with a scornful glance at the Scotchman, who was giving the fire the gentlest of admonitions. “Here you, Adam McKee! just see to that smoke yonder—Andy won't be back this side of Christmas—and I'll take a turn at this cedar. Come, step round, or the fire 'll be to many for us yet.” McKee moved off accordingly; but so little satisfactory was his handling of the smoke, that Mr. Barrington muttered, “If t'other Adam didn't have more sense, Job couldn't ha' stood him!” And now the edge fire of the road gradually burned itself out, leaving the scorched undergrowth, and heaps of blackened leaves and twigs, and trees with a charred stripe or band to tell of its work. On the other side of that narrow passage all was fresh and green among the pines, and the few deciduous trees were unspoiled of their lively hangings. The sidelong glances of the sun fell on them, giving and taking loveliness, while the burnt region was in the shade of evening as well as of desolation. The excitement and wild beauty of the fire were all gone, except in the few places where it had mastered some pine or hemlock, and still wreathed them with flame and smoke to their very branch-ends. It was all safe at last, and when everything had been once more inspected, and all possible communication between the green and the dry cut off, we went home; after giving Ezra such of our thanks as could be put in words. “'Tain't any obligation that a chicken couldn't stand under,” he said. “My gracious! I should ha' got sich a combing from the old woman if I'd been up to doing anything else! And besides,” added Mr. Barrington with a near approach to a smile, “I'm afeerd I was a leetle too glad to spile somebody's dancing, for want of a fiddler.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXV. Now westlin winds, and slaughtering guns, Bring autumn's pleasant weather; The muircock springs, on whirring wings, Amang the blooming heather. Come let us stray our gladsome way, And view the charms of nature; The rustling corn, the fruited thorn, And every happy creature. Burns. “AND when is Mr. Carvill going to town?” inquired my father next morning, when he had disposed of Mr. Barrington's first remark, that “he s'posed there wa'n't nothing left o' the Squire, but he thought he'd just stop down and see.” “When does he mean to seek winter quarters?” “Not knowin couldn't say,” replied Ezra concisely. “And how do you feel after such a hard day's work?” said my stepmother. “Spry as a cricket, ma'am: my wife says I hadn't ought to have come for the Squire at all; but I telled her I guessed she'd find out first time she tried, that a fire in the wood wa'n't a fire in a flower-pot.” “I can't think how it happened,” said my father. “They couldn't have been shooting in the wood itself, and the ground beyond is low and swampy.” “They was in the mash sir, but there's always dry stuff lies round a fence, and that ketched first; and then the fire kinder gin under the fence and so up.” “And what did Mr. Carvill say to your quitting him to help me?” “Hum”—said Ezra with a little grunt, “his speech wa'n't hardly worth taking down—I reckon he thought if I wouldn't haw, he'd as good holler gee.” “And is the Lea house as full as ever?” “They wouldn't go—for chips!” was the emphatic reply. “They'll have to go, by and by,” said Mr. Howard smiling, “a little cold weather would soon spoil their singing and sporting.” “Singing!” exclaimed Ezra indignantly, “'tain't nothing in life but hollering—I'd a sight rather hear a chap fiddle `Hail Columby.' And as to the sporting, if the dogs don't have the best on it, I'm beat to know who has—I'm sure it ain't me. Landsakes! Squire, I'd as lief as a spring rain that you'd seen one o' them 'ere shootin jackets stick fast in the mash! it beat general trainin all to splinters. If I'd ha' been him, I'd ha' shot every soul of the rest of 'em, for laughing.” And with this graphic description Mr. Barrington walked away. The Lea party seemed to bear the cool weather pretty well,—better than we did their behaviour; for whether by chance or on purpose, they seemed always to choose their shooting ground as near as possible to the boundary line of our property. Morning, noon, and night, dogs were barking and guns cracking all about us, till we began to be afraid to venture out while such unceremonious pleasure-hunters were in the neighbourhood. Meantime Mr. Collingwood arrived, but took up his abode at the Lea; partly because he thought Miss Easy not well enough to have guests, partly, as he told her, because “it seemed best.” “Do you feel inclined to bear an old man company in a visit to a young one, Mr. Howard?” said our good clergyman as he entered our house some day or two after. “Why, yes—”said my father, “with all my heart—I've been thinking of it,—if one could only get there except across half a dozen—”and in the search for a term sufficiently mild, Mr. Howard stopped short. “Precisely my dear sir,” said Mr. Ellis; “but it will be hard if you and I together cannot get safe across a half dozen of anything.” “Guns included?” said my stepmother smiling, though with a somewhat doubtful expression. “Guns included, ma'am—by the help of Dec. He'll find out the gunners before they fire, and eat 'em up afterwards, if I tell him to.” “O if Dec is along that alters the case,” said Mrs. Howard looking at the huge mastiff, who seemed indeed as if he would make short work with “a half dozen of anything.” Now Mr. Ellis's dog was called “Declaration of Independence.” The weather was so fine, that after they had gone Mrs. Howard and Kate and I, took books and work, and went to spend the morning out of doors: choosing for our retreat a little thicket which was open enough to admit the air's freshness, while yet it sheltered us from the sun. And there we sat in very quiet enjoyment, until, as Ezra Barrington had expressed it, “a gun went off in the wrong place.” We had seated ourselves not far from the bar-place that opened upon Mr. Carvill's domains, trusting to our ears to inform us if any one approached; but the unseen sportsman had been so still in his movements, that our first warning was the report of his piece. We sprang up, and at the moment a little bird fell fluttering at our feet,—fluttering but an instant, and then the shot's cruel work was done: the foot was slightly drawn up, then stretched out, and the bird lay motionless. Almost as motionless we stood, breathing with that oppressed feeling which finds no utterance; but recollecting immediately that a second shot might follow the first, we retreated; I carrying the bird, yet warm and hanging listlessly over my hand. It was a wax-wing, or cedar-bird, as we often called them: the head and throat and back of a light fawn-colour shading off into grey, and that again into blue: the tail tipped with gamboge. The feathers were quite unruffled except in one little place where the shot had entered,—softly smoothed down, as the bird had preened himself for his last flight. Quick as our footsteps were, we had but just cleared the trees when we heard some one spring over the fence, and then came an impatient, “It must have fallen somewhere in these confounded bushes.” We turned, and saw Mr. Carvill and a companion in mischief. The former had evidently found more in the bushes than he had counted upon; but a moment's hesitation gave way to his usual easy bearing, and he came forward and “supposed we must be well, as we all looked so charmingly”; and then glancing at the bird he inquired, “how long it was since I had taken to petting inanimate nature?” I made no reply, but my stepmother with more sternness than she often brought to bear upon delinquents, remarked, “You may be thankful Mr. Carvill that your shot did not take effect upon one of us.” “Upon my soul ma'am, I am thankful—remarkably so, —wish I could think it had taken no effect except on that little bundle of feathers, but both these young ladies look `severe in youthful dignity.' Well—`variety's charming' —even when the `statu quo' is so agreeable as in the case of the Miss Howards. Miss Grace, shall I relieve you of your affecting burden?” “What did you shoot it for?” was my somewhat unceremonious reply. “What? the `burden'?” said Mr. Carvill, putting his hands on his sides and looking serious,—“wanted him—did 'pon my honour. Mrs. Carvill's remarkably fond of waxwings—thought she'd like one for dinner; and if her appetite changed before I got home (which might happen) they always command a good price—one to two shillings a dozen, I think; and that would be—let me see—just one or two cents apiece. You see even I didn't go to college for nothing—never forgot my arithmetic to this day.” “As your memory is so good, Mr. Carvill,” said Kate, “won't you please to remember where our house is, and to keep as far from it as possible in future, when you are shooting?” “Do my endeavour, Miss Howard—did this morning,— hadn't an idea that you were anywhere in the neighbourhood till I jumped that fence,—thought I was off t'other end of my own grounds,—left my wits at home I suppose, to work upon that last lecture of Rodney's. For pity's sake, ladies all, don't tell him of my misdeeds!—between the having killed a protegée of the Miss Howards, and the not having brought home Mrs. Carvill's dinner, there would be nothing left for me but to `cut my walking-stick.' Hey, George?” he added. “You had better cut it at once,” said his companion. “Cut your own and welcome,” replied Mr. Carvill; “but I have some feeling, and cannot leave Miss Grace in such a distressed state of mind. Let me see if the wound is mortal—maybe 'twas only a feint he took;” and the bird was out of my hand before I had decided whether I would let it go. “Ha—dead enough!—good little gun that, George— don't suppose he had the smallest idea what was the matter with him. Well, if Rodney was safe in Cumberland, I'd take this chez ma femme, but I've no notion of having a rescue attempted,—so farewell wax-wing—melancholy trophy of a good shot!” and with one powerful fling he sent the bird whirling over the tops of the trees. Then kissing the tip of his shooting-glove, Mr. Carvill sprang over the fence again, and fired us a parting air-salute from the other side: which just served to exhaust the small remnant of our patience. “He is the most unendurable man I ever saw!” exclaimed Kate. “O Dec!” I said, as the dog dashed in between us, “if you had only been here to give them at least a good barking for their pains!” Dec flourished about with his nose to the ground and with now and then a smothered growl of discovery or disapprobation, as if he fully entered into my wish; and then subsided into a very quiet dog-trot to follow his master home. “We did not find our friend, after all,” said my father, “and Mrs. Carvill either couldn't or wouldn't say where he was.” “So you saw Mrs. Carvill?” “I saw Mrs. Carvill—with about as much satisfaction as she saw me. She has taken a fair draught of Lethe since last spring—I had some thoughts of making Mr. Ellis introduce me. Ah here comes the very person we were in search of. Mr. Collingwood, we have voted you blessed with an invisible cap.” Mr. Collingwood made some light answer to this remark, but he looked ill at ease—very grave, very sad; so that we scarcely knew what to talk about, lest we should touch the wrong subject. We had established ourselves once more under the trees, but he declined to sit down; and though he took part in the conversation, it was with the air of a man whose thoughts are far away from his words—very different from his usual manner. Once I tried to call home his abstraction by some laughing remark about Wolfgang, but the expression which followed his smile, seemed graver than ever. “I was surprised to hear from Mrs. Carvill that you leave us this week,” said my father. “Yes sir, to-morrow.” “And when are you coming again?” asked Mrs. Howard. “Not till December; unless—I may perhaps come before.” “And then you will stay at the Bird's Nest?” “So I have just promised Miss Easy.” “You have seen her to-day then, and how is she?” said my stepmother, striking out upon what she thought must be a safe tack. But the shade deepened painfully upon Mr. Rodney's face as he answered, “I do not see much change in her, Mrs. Howard—she says she feels stronger than when I came home.” My stepmother looked at him, with that woman's eye which reflects as truly the shadows of twilight as the distinct figures of noonday; and saw—I could not tell what, but merely saying that she had been out long enough she left us and went to the house. Thither we followed her, but more leisurely; and Mr. Rodney assuming at least an appearance of cheerfulness, asked Kate and me to take a walk with him. There was no need to ask twice, and though our spirits had been a little damped by the constraint of the previous half hour, the mere exercise of getting ready quite restored them. We came into the parlour in a mood too gay almost to notice the faces there, or to perceive the pause that every tongue made at our entrance. But Kate presently recollected it. “Mr. Rodney,” she said when we were a little way from the house, “what were you all talking about when we came down? Mamma was telling you that perhaps you were mistaken,—I meant to have asked her then, but something put it out of my head.” “Will you forgive me Miss Kate, if I do not answer you now?” he said, as he stooped to let down the bars. “I suppose I shall have to,” said Kate laughing—“happily curiosity is not one of my ruling passions. But aren't you taking us in the way of powder and shot?” “No,” said he, consulting his watch, “not at this hour. Carvill's companions in arms are not romantic enough to shoot all day without eating, and this is about their luncheon time.” “Don't you ever shoot, Mr. Rodney?” “I have done such a thing Gracie, but of late years my taste has lain another way. Indeed I never thoroughly liked the business; and when I found that I must `get used to it' before it could give me more pleasure than pain, I came to the conclusion that I didn't wish to get used to it, and shouldn't think so much of myself if that point were attained.” I said we were in a gay mood, though there was no particular cause; but it was with us that happy time of life when the heart dances to its own music—as it never can dance to any other! The trying circumstances of the last year had but partially sobered us,—they were but a weight put in one scale, not the long-continued strain which at last destroys the spring of the balance, so that it never rises again to its fair equilibrium. Thus the soberness was quickly shaken off when past annoyances were old and the new not come; and this was such an interval, and we were full of enjoyment. Mr. Collingwood half caught the infection, in spite of himself as it were, and in a little while talked and looked much as usual: though when after a few minutes silence we turned to say something to him, we could often see that both eye and mouth had resumed their thoughtfully grave lines and expression. And yet that day alone might have cheered any one. It was colder than the day of our fire in the woods, but with such a sky! and air that seemed almost as rarefied and sparkling as Champagne. 11 “Mr. Rodney,” said Kate, “if I thought you would not be displeased, I should advance an opinion.” “You may venture,” he said with a smile. “One has no right to put oneself under a cloud in such weather.”— “I agree to that perfectly Miss Kate—with this slight qualification: one has as good a right in fair weather as in foul.” “But not so good reason?” said Kate with the kind of look that the sun sends through a fog. “Voluntary clouds are unreasonable things at best,” said Mr. Collingwood, but with no perverse closing of the fog around him; “and truly I have no excuse to plead but human nature—that will sometimes concern itself about those possibilities which are not its care. Gracie, here is wychhazel,—weren't you wishing for some yesterday?” “This is one of the prettiest of our wild shrubs,” said Kate, as we broke off some of the twigs that displayed alternately their bright yellow flowers and large brownish yellow leaves. “Is that the power of `a name'?” said Mr. Rodney. “Partly, perhaps—or of the association the name brings with it. But I have wished sometimes that one could resolve the near presence of things—joy and sorrow and danger—as easily as the old diviners thought they could find water with one of these hazel twigs.” “So do not I!” said our companion. “If I were to wish at all, it would be for a guide to `the wells of consolation' —one that should point upward and not downward—and that we have already.” “And yet,” said Kate, whom I half suspected to have a secret purpose in what she said, “and yet Mr. Rodney if I could tell—if I were sure of happiness to-morrow, to-day's grief would not so much affect me.” “Well,” he said, “you may be sure of it—only call to-morrow heaven, and to-day earth. “`'Tis by the faith of joys to come, We walk through deserts dark as night.'” His eye had brightened and his brow cleared, and Kate's smile as she turned from the bush and went on, made me sure that I had guessed right. But for some time we walked in silence. We had crossed a piece of woodland that skirted the high road, and were about to cross that too, when the galloping tread of a horse came flying along at a rate that made us pause. “Here is somebody who has got used to several things, I should think,” said Kate. “Apparently she has not your ideas of self-esteem Mr. Rodney.” The apparition came on, surrounded with a cloud of drapery that would have been graceful had it been aught but dust,—as it was the brown steed and his rider loomed dimly out from what seemed a most uncomfortable atmosphere—it made one clear one's throat to look at them. But the wreaths rolled gently off towards us, and settled pleasantly upon our sunbonnets and dresses, when the lady after returning Mr. Rodney's bow, wheeled her horse and came to a sudden stop just in front of us. Dust was certainly not the only thing with which she was familiar. A light fowling-piece lay carelessly across her saddle, at the side of which hung the game-bag; its contents sufficiently made known by the partridge and quail heads that hung limp and bloody through its meshes. The lady's dress was as near an approach to shooting trim as comported with the retention of petticoats: powder-flask and shot-bag were not wanting, and our eyes ascended with increasing wonder to the fair hair and face of the second Miss Brown, and her little straw cap. “Good-morning Mr. Collingwood,” she said. “Will you have the goodness to come and look at this buckle? I saddled my horse in such a hurry that I have been in momentary expectation of a downfal.” “If you will permit me to say so, Miss Harriet,” said Mr. Collingwood as he obeyed her commands, “saddling a horse is the very last thing that should be done in a hurry.” “It was the last thing I did in mine,” said the young lady laughing, “for I was all ready before I touched him,— but I always do it in a hurry, for that matter.” “You should not do it at all then,” pursued Mr. Collingwood. “Then I never should ride.—Jack's always ploughing or something else, and the Squire won't be bothered. Can't it ever be done fast and well?” “By an experienced hand.” “I wish you'd experience my hand,” said Miss Brown— “I never had any one to teach me how. Come Mr. Collingwood, say you'll ride over to-morrow and give me a lesson.” “I must ride to Cumberland to-morrow. There, I believe the buckle is all right—Why didn't you make Carvill give you a lesson before you mounted, Miss Harriet?” “How did you know I had been there?” “`I can see a church by daylight,'” replied Mr. Rodney smiling. “Well but look here, why don't you compliment me on my skill?—shot every one of these myself,” she said, shaking the bag with its dangling appendages; “I did upon my word.” Mr. Collingwood made no reply except by an involuntary step back, which to us was sufficiently expressive. “Where are you going?” said Miss Brown. “I haven't half done talking to you.” “But it will not do to try a lady's patience unduly, and I have left two waiting for me. Is there any other buckle you wish me to examine, Miss Harriet?” “Half a dozen. Why bless me! what a squire of dames you would make! Don't you know it's always the distressed damsel that claims most of the attention of a true knight?” “Rather a sudden promotion from squire to knight, isn't it?” said Mr. Collingwood, whose attention was just then bestowed upon the horse's head-gear. “Answer me and I'll answer you.” “It may perhaps be questioned,” said he with a smile, “whether the distressed damsel is the one who carries powder and shot.” “You are enough to provoke anybody! Here, I'll set your conscience at rest,” said Miss Harriet riding up to the stone where we had seated ourselves,—“Mr. Collingwood will you please to introduce me.—Now Miss Howard will you please to excuse this gentleman while he examines my girths and martingal?” “Certainly,” Kate said, in a tone of such quiet good-breeding as sounded strangely after Miss Brown's rattle; and for which she was rewarded by as many examining looks as that lady could spare from her older acquaintance. “Do you know Mr. Collingwood,” she went on, “I have fairly lamed my shoulder with shooting.” “Does that never act as a preventive?” “Dear me no! who'd care for such a trifle?—We had the most splendid time to-day!—I never enjoyed anything so much.” “I am—This martingal seems hardly needed.” “No matter.—What are you? tired of fixing buckles?” “Nay I have rather more strength of muscle than that would imply.” “Well what are you then?” said she impatiently. “I was going to tell you that I was glad you had enjoyed yourself.” “And what made you stop?—say.” “Never push people into a corner,” said Mr. Collingwood,—“it is dangerous. That girth is perfectly safe Miss Harriet, and your ride home may be quite uneventful unless you or Peter are wilful.” “Peter's never wilful—but I am, so tell me what made you stop,—I sha'n't let you go till you do. Why didn't you finish your speech?” “I found it was like to be an untrue one, that's all,” said Mr. Collingwood smiling. “Upon my word!—so you wish I hadn't enjoyed myself! —well you haven't got the character of plain speaking for nothing—that's certain. I think I won't talk to you any more after that. O stay—who is that handsome Baltimorean down yonder?” “What Baltimorean and where?” “Down yonder—at the Lea,—I don't know his name or I shouldn't ask.” “There are three there,” said Mr. Collingwood. “Well—the handsome one.” “I do not think either of them handsome. But Miss Harriet I really must bid you good-morning.” “Answer me first—you know who he is—very tall, dark and talkative—” “I suppose you mean Mr. Forsyth,” said Mr. Collingwood gravely. “I do not recommend him to your acquaintance, Miss Harriet.” “I didn't suppose you would. There, I release your hand and patience;” and adding something which failed to reach our ears, the young lady rode off, gathering her brown drapery about her as she went. Without a word except those expressed by a deep-drawn breath Mr. Collingwood crossed the road and entered the pleasant shade on the other side. “Confess that you are out of patience, for once,” said Kate laughingly as we overtook him,—“but Mr. Rodney, there is no one left in the road to run away from now.” “I will confess and beg pardon both, after such a reprimand,” he said with a quick smile of assurance that it was not from us he meant to run away. “Aren't you too tired to go any further? and you Gracie? I should think your patience might have failed.” “I am not tired.” “Nor I,” said Kate; “but perhaps you are?” “Not with walking. I never can rest after such a conversation till I have walked it off. There is something very far removed from folly and weariness in the quiet shade of these forest trees,—it is so pure, so peaceful, that the mind is as much refreshed as the body.” “You wouldn't have thought our woods very peaceful the other day—wasn't it too bad?” said I, recollecting the next moment that I ought not to have said it. But Mr. Collingwood had that happy tact which never sees more than the pleasant and polite side of a thing. It would have been difficult to offend him if you had tried—impossible to do it accidentally. So he answered my question as simply as it had been put. “Rather too bad Gracie, and yet it afforded me some amusement.” “Amusement!” I said looking up at him. “I should have said was the means of it. Ezra Barrington gave us a most striking account of the whole affair, and I am sure you would have been amused even in the midst of your sorrow. He said `he guessed Mr. Carvill would have felt cut up, if he had seen Miss Kate and Miss Grace sitting on the stones and looking at the fire.' And Gracie he thinks that your sister `goes a little ahead of all other young ladies'—so you must forgive him for making me laugh.” We laughed ourselves heartily enough, at this representation, wondering privately what kind of a reply Ezra got for his pains. And then having ascended a little hill where the thinned trees gave us a view of the country round, we turned to go home. “There goes Miss Brown,” I said, pointing to a dark little cloud on the distant highway. “Does she always do so, Mr. Rodney?” said Kate. “Not always just so—she generally acts in character.” “Why don't you tell her what people think of her behaviour?” “She knows now Gracie, it would be wasting words.” “I think you are wrong, Mr. Rodney,” said Kate, “she may be just carried away by her own flightiness. I'm sure I would thank anybody for speaking the truth to me in her place.” “In her place!” he said. “My dear Miss Kate if you were anywhere near that, I am afraid I should tell you all I think of it,—more perhaps than I have any right to. Happily there is no danger.” “You wouldn't call it waste words, and think we were not worth the trouble?” “The one thing is about as possible as the other,” said Mr. Rodney smiling. “But as for Miss Brown—she thinks advice is `good fun', as she calls it. I have seen her tried, or at least know that she has been,—she rather likes to draw people into reproving her.” A slight rustling among the dry twigs made us stop and look; and from a clump of bushes near us a hare darted away with all the speed that fear could give,—there was fear in the very stretch of its slight body across the ground; and its ears lay back to their full extent, as if to take note of our steps. In another instant our four-footed companion had come back from contemplating a woodpecker, and had given himself to the pursuit. Involuntarily I clasped my hands at that disproportioned match of size and strength. But the habit of obedience was too strong for instinct, and Mr. Rodney's quick, decided, “Wolfgang!” brought the dog at once to a stand,—not willingly: his eye sent back a beseeching request to have the injunction taken off. “Come!” said his master quietly, and Wolfgang turned and walked up to us; but as his head was raised to receive Mr. Rodney's caress, and his eye most affectionately answered the word of praise from that loved voice, there was something still in its expression which said it was a pity his master didn't know better! “O here is its form!” I said,—“look Kate—this little round place at the foot of the pine tree, with the branches hanging all over it. The leaves are warm yet! Silly thing! if it had stayed still we should not have seen it. It has given itself a fright for nothing.” A little more time brought us to our own door, but our companion refused to come in. “We have had such a pleasant walk,” Kate and I said as we shook hands with him. “It has been most pleasant to me,” he answered, “and has done me more good than anything else I could have tried. Good-morning, I will not say good-bye till to-morrow.” And with a somewhat slackened step, Mr. Collingwood crossed the lawn, and took the little path that led to the Bird's Nest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVI. The path by which we twain did go, Which led by tracts that pleased us well, Through four sweet years arose and fell, From flower to flower, from snow to snow. But where the path we walked began To slant the fifth autumnal slope, As we descended, following Hope, There sat the Shadow feared of man. Tennyson. HOW did we hear it! how did we bear to hear it!—I do not know—there seems a mist over that day when my father came in from his walk and told us, what she herself had said: that the life-current of the best friend we had at Glen Luna, would perhaps not last out the tide of that swift-running year. I say I know not how we heard it, and yet I remember the unbelief—so hard to give up; the bitter tears, so hard to stay. The anxious questioning of physicians, the unvarying reply—that those months of weakness and ill-health had been but the gradual wearing out from which there was no return,—the gentle drawing back of every bolt and bar that hindered the free spirit's flight. Yet still Kate and I hoped; in spite of the grave certainty on my father's face —the steadfast sorrow on Mrs. Howard's; with a hope that Phœnix like, died and sprung up again from its own ashes. It would live—everywhere but in Miss Easy's presence. She did not speak to us of her daily decreasing strength: she was placid, cheerful as she had ever been; and except that we found her on the sofa instead of at the window or in her garden, things seemed much as usual. But the eye that met us as we entered the room, the quiet keeping of our hands after the first clasp was over, said, O how plainly, “Not long!”—and sometimes the steady, absent gaze 11* through the bay-window, spoke of other scenes with which the mind was already growing familiar. We could have better borne an expression that had more of earth. Much as we had loved her for those years of sympathetic friendship, we were drawn yet closer by the love with which she now clung to us—even more than ever,—as deepen the waters of a stream before the barrier that is raised to their future progress. Miss Easy's greatest earthly comfort seemed to be in our society. At first it was little more than the society of heart—even our eyes shrank from encountering hers; and many an hour passed in almost unbroken silence. Not always,—sometimes we ventured to talk, and often read to her; and sometimes—but that was not at first—we sang her favourite hymns. And by degrees, as heart and voice learned to control themselves, we grew to loving all —especially the last—as no pleasure can be loved that is not mixed with one drop of great bitterness. I said there was no spring like that of life,—neither is there any autumn like that which sometimes follows the young heart's summer: when the leaves fall that cannot be replaced, and the birds fly away that will never come back. When the stream that swept off the rubbish of every-day life is stayed with ice which the spirit will scarce ever have heat enough to thaw away. In the calm we had enjoyed for several months, old annoyances seemed to have faded out, but with this new, real sorrow, how quickly and vividly they all revived! We felt as if it was the fall of everything—money diminishing, difficulties increasing; and the one friend near us whom we loved and trusted, passing away like the rest! It is not enough to have the support of one's own immediate family,—a single fibre of confidence that can take root without, fetches much comfort, and strengthens and refreshes all within. And the fibre takes hold so joyously if perchance it finds a soil that neither repels nor dries it up!—it is hard transplanting. “Yes,” said Miss Easy thoughtfully, as we sat by her one afternoon, “yes—we have loved each other very much. Ever since the day when this child came running in from the woods, and stood looking so shyly and quietly at me, I have loved her—loved you all. I thought the wind had the best hair-brush I had ever seen, Gracie. And you are just what you were then—yes, every one of you—only better. What should I do without you now!” “I wish you would let us stay here all the time, dear Miss Easy,” said Kate. “No, it isn't necessary for me, and it wouldn't be good for you, dear—no, I am sure of it. I won't let you be here except in the day; at least not at present.” “We love to be here,” said Kate softly; and I looked up and added, “Very much!”—and Miss Easy smiled her belief of our words, but still repeated, “Not at present.” How glad we all were that Miss Avarintha was away! how happy to want her bustling attentions! and though Miss Easy never said as much, we were sure she thought it. Indeed she could hardly help feeling the different manner in which my stepmother did everything; for putting heart out of the question, Mrs. Howard was perfect in that very point where Miss Bain was most deficient—“the not too much.” A blessed thing everywhere, especially in a sick room. How quietly and thoughtfully was all arranged, provided, or directed! and by such counsels and example, Kate and I became as Miss Easy declared, “the two best little mice she had ever seen.” But my stepmother could not be satisfied that the long nights should be passed alone; and by dint of a true woman's gentle management and persuasion she carried her point, and came to the Bird's Nest every night to take the place we had supplied by day. And then after an early breakfast, Kate and I would have a quick frosty walk in the morning air, to find my stepmother at her friend's side, reading or talking in a voice that carried comfort with it. And Miss Easy would say tearfully, “I went to sleep with your mother here Katie, and I dreamed that it was an angel.” The days never seemed long when we sat there working and talking, or listening in our turn—the bright hopefulness of Miss Easy's face almost forbade their being sad: we were half beguiled into her glad acceptance of whatever God sent. But as November fairly set in—as the leaves lost more and more of October's bright colouring, and fluttered dry and shrivelled from the half-stripped trees, how were the days winged!—how was the little wood-path that we trod every morning dark with more than the sun's absence! and as his long beams looked at us over the Brown bluff as we walked slowly home at night, they glanced from my heart as it had been ice—bringing only a quick feeling of pain by their exceeding brightness. We were less constantly with Miss Easy now,—she could not bear to have many in her room at once, and my stepmother being most needed, hardly ever left it. A letter from Miss Easy's own hand (she would let no one else write it) had summoned Mr. Rodney; and he had arrived, and did very much to help and support both patient and nurse. Still our friend made a point of seeing us every day, but they were quiet visits—little said on either side except by the eye and the hand, and that little almost too much. Many a time did Kate and I go weeping home, after one of those long looks of affection from Miss Easy, so full of sympathy for our trembling words, so unshrinking, so undoubting for herself. The last few days of November came; and with them all the glory of Indian summer,—warm, sunny, breathless: the remaining leaves unstirred; the hills blue with haze. Even Brown bluff lost its ruggedness under the universal veil of that soft sunlight. We had gone rather late to the Bird's Nest, hoping first to get some message; for without this the walk was always one of painful forebodings: but no message came, and not willing to wait longer Kate and I set out. No word was spoken—the bright glory of the afternoon was oppressive— clouds would have been pleasanter. We could not breathe freely in that perfect stillness; and as we passed the white curtains—hanging listlessly and unlooped-up now—our steps were quickened, and I saw Kate's hand pressed upon her heart, as if to silence that too. We saw no one when we first reached the house, and going softly up stairs we entered Miss Easy's room. She appeared to be half sleeping, and with more weariness and prostration in her attitude than we had ever seen—the position of the very fingers seemed involuntary. She was a little raised up, supported by pillows, and my stepmother's gentle hands had arranged her hair, and tied over it one of those handkerchiefs which it had become second nature to wear; and a very slight motion of the fringed ends was the only token that breath yet came through the parted lips. We gazed fearfully for a moment, then looked round for Mrs. Howard. She had gone to lie down; and there was no one in the room but Mr. Rodney, who had risen at our entrance and now stood at the other side of the bed,—a look was our only greeting. The windows were all open, and the warm light had found its way even in here; and beautiful pictures lay without,— on one side, of the lake—on the other, of meadow-land, then our bluff, and the smoky hills beyond. Again that painful stillness—the chirp of a bird, the rustle of some dry leaf as it fell, were all,—each breath that we drew was more and more smothered; while Mr. Collingwood's watch measured off the minutes that we were to stand there. They were not many.—Miss Easy turned her head slightly and opened her eyes; and her first look fell on us. The never-failing smile came on the instant—grave, amid all its sweetness. “Come to see me once more!” she said, holding out her hand. “Dear children! yes, they have been such a comfort!” We stooped down to kiss her, but without venturing to speak; and then when we had drawn our chairs close to the bed, she took both our hands in one of hers, and giving the other to Mr. Rodney she again closed her eyes, and lay for a while quiet: the gentle pressure of the hand from time to time, just telling that she remembered and loved our presence. “Katie,” she said then, speaking low and at intervals, “never allow yourself to dread anything. Ever since I lost my mother, one sorrowful thought has been on my mind— that I should die alone,—and see what has come of it!— how safely we may trust all to God's arranging!—What could I have more?—not one friend, but several—the best. —Could any sister have been like your mother—could I have loved my own children better than I love you three!”— “The love is not lost,” said Mr. Rodney gently. Again she lay still, but looking out at the bright landscape and the declining sun. “It was from this window I saw your flag, little Gracie —and thought what a sister it must be for whom you took so much trouble,—how long ago—how past! We have been very happy together—we shall be yet happier—I trust. `Not lost'—O no!—it brings some pain, but more pleasure. I am quite happy—I shall look for you all!” “You are not suffering, dear Miss Easy?” said Kate after another pause. “No love—I have nothing but peace,—this weariness only betokens rest—`from this place I cannot so much as see Doubting Castle.'” Another short silence, and then without opening her eyes, Miss Easy said, “Sing to me.” But how?—We had commanded ourselves so far, our hearts had been as it were locked up that no sorrow might come forth to show itself: but that little request told so much of the past, so much of the future, compliance was almost impossible—it was like the touch of a master-key. In vain Kate strove—the words would not come unless tears came with them; and then, thoughtfully kind as ever, Mr. Rodney gave us time, and himself began the hymn. “Thou very-present Aid In danger or distress! The mind that still on thee is stayed, Is kept in perfect peace.” The words, the tune, albeit the voice that sang them steadied itself with difficulty, calmed us. There are some feelings too high, too much above the world not to stay its tears; and that one breath of `things eternal' seemed to keep down the swelling of our hearts—to carry them away from `things temporal';—and still clasping Miss Easy's hand we sang to her of that faith she had so long practised —that refuge she had so long sought. “Another—” she said,—“my favourite.” Again we sang, but the words were more of life's weakness—it was harder work. “`We would see Jesus'—for the shadows lengthen Across this little landscape of our life, `We would see Jesus', our weak faith to strengthen For the last weariness—the final strife. “`We would see Jesus'—for life's hand hath rested With its dark touch upon both heart and brow; And though our souls have many a billow breasted, Others are rising in the distance now. “`We would see Jesus,'—the great rock foundation Whereon our feet were set by sovereign grace. Not life nor death, with all their agitation, Can thence remove us if we see his face. “`We would see Jesus!' other lights are paling Which for long years we have rejoiced to see: The blessings of our pilgrimage are failing— We would not mourn them, for we go to thee! “`We would see Jesus.'—Yet the spirit lingers Round the dear objects it has loved so long, And earth from earth can searce unclose its fingers,— Our love to thee makes not this love less strong. “`We would see Jesus.'—Sense is all too blinding, And heaven appears too dim—too far away. We would see thee to gain a sweet reminding That thou hast promised our great debt to pay. “`We would see Jesus!' this is all we're needing,— Strength, joy, and willingness come with the sight. `We would see Jesus'—dying, risen, pleading;— Then welcome day! and farewell mortal night!” The mind might have had its wish, for Miss Easy's face was clear as if all shadows of earth had fled away—as if faith had almost given place to sight, when she said, “Once more—`My faith looks up to Thee!'” “My faith looks up to thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary: Saviour divine! Now hear me, while I pray; Take all my guilt away; Oh! let me from this day Be wholly thine. “May thy rich grace impart Strength to my fainting heart,— My zeal inspire: As thou hast died for me, O may my love to thee, Pure, warm, and changeless be,— A living fire. “While life's dark maze I tread, And griefs around me spread, Be thou my guide;— Bid darkness turn to day, Wipe sorrow's tears away, Nor let me ever stray From thee aside. “When ends life's transient dream; When death's cold sullen stream Shall o'er me roll;— Dear Saviour, then, in love, Fear and distrust remove; Oh! bear me safe above,— A ransomed soul!” It was sung—though with that nervous moving of the lip and wavering of the voice that were controlled only because they must be; but with the ending of the last verse all my fortitude gave way,—I was trembling from head to foot. Closer Miss Easy held my hand. “He will do that,” she said—“for me—for you. `His covenant will he not break,'—His word cannot fail—see that your trust fail not.” She was silent a moment, and in that moment came the twittering of a bird under the window, clear, distinct—it was like the echo of those last words, “See that you trust him!” And Miss Easy looking up at us with exceeding fondness and with a smile that yet shone through tears, said, “Good-night my dear children!—I must not keep you longer.” We bent over her, and passing her arm round each of us she kissed us once and again, and then after one more long look, quietly closed her eyes and we left her. But as we passed through the door we heard her say slowly, “No more on earth!—but oh Mr. Rodney, I shall see them in heaven!” And hastily going down stairs Kate and I went into the little parlour, and wept out all the smothered feelings of that afternoon. “No more on earth!”—she spoke true. When we met my stepmother in the morning there was no need to ask tidings—they were written on her face. Gentle, peaceful as had been life, even such was death—“the golden bridge from earth's clay-banks to heaven's shore!” The Indian summer still lingered;—as lingered the smile upon Miss Easy's face,—loth to give place to darkness and decay. It was there to the last,—the soul's own gilding on its broken temple—the written receipt of all the blessings to which she had looked forward. That face might have convinced an unbeliever;—how strongly it repeated to us, “See that your trust fail not!” In that very room where three days before we had sung of the hope that was now perfected, we three stood looking from the north window. The same golden light, the same soft haze, the same sun sending his slant beams over the Brown bluff; while along the little path that wound about its base, rising and falling with the broken ground, went the little train of dark figures. They were but few— Mr. Ellis, my father, Mr. Rodney, our old retainer Ezra Barrington, Squire Suydam, and some of the poor country people whom she had befriended, were all. We would not have had it otherwise—we would not have had a crowd of careless ones:—in that handful of men there were not more figures than hearts; and as they now and then stopped to change bearers, we knew it was a precious office to them all,—knew there was not one whose foot would not go gently over the rough ground, whose hand was not tenderly adjusted to its work. And so we watched them— sending our hearts too, with the procession, till it had passed round the bluff, and in all that fair prospect there was nothing but the warm sunshine of Indian summer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVII. I passed by the walls of Balclutha, and they were desolate. Ossian. AT the earnest request of Mr. and Mrs. Howard, Mr. Rodney remained with us for the few days during which he finished and arranged all the business that had been entrusted to his care. It was not much. Miss Easy had given him her cottage and all its contents, except some parting tokens to us. But not finding just the person he wished to take charge of it, Mr. Rodney accepted my stepmother's offer of storage-room for such things as were most valuable and easily removed, and then the little abode was securely fastened up, and left untenanted,—unvisited save by the sighing winds and our quiet footsteps. For Kate and I still loved to go there, and to look up at the windows and imagine the light that once came from them; and never did we leave the little far-off church, without going to the one spot near it that we loved best. It was the night before Mr. Rodney went away; and in that wearied state of reaction which follows a time of mental and bodily excitement, we were sitting round the fire after tea, silently musing. For a while I had mused like the rest, and then my thoughts came back from their wanderings, and were concentred upon the group around me. What were they all thinking of? I drew a little more into the shade of the chimney and tried to determine. My stepmother I judged was asleep, and no wonder after what she had gone through,—if her mind worked at all, it was under the influence of the same fatigue which had drooped her head upon my father's shoulder, and closed her eyes in such quiet rest. Mr. Howard himself was very far from sleep,—whatever his mind was debating, mine might as well have threaded the labyrinths of the milky-way as the expression of his face,—I could make nothing of it. That did not surprise me,—I seldom could. I leaned forward to look at Kate. She sat on a low seat at the other side of the chimney, her head bent down and resting on her knees; but though absolutely motionless I felt sure she was awake; and though the firelight shone but upon the hand that shielded the side of her face, it seemed to me that I read its look, even in those very closed fingers. I knew with what steady, sobering effect our changed circumstances had wrought, in spite of the young life that had often rebelled against it,—I knew how very deeply she had felt this last sorrow,—and I thought of her in our old parlour in Philadelphia, and then as she was soon after she came to the Glen, when she talked with my father about our neighbours! How little her attitude now spoke of that touch of pride which my father had called her only fault! But surely the pride had taken other things with it,—I could not look at her for a while—it grieved me. She had not stirred when I again turned my head; but as I watched her, a slight motion at her side caught my eye, and as the fire blazed up I saw Wolfgang's paw, stretched out and lying upon her dress. His head rested quietly upon his master's foot, which the other paw protectingly encircled,—if dogs can have presentiments, then was Wolfgang's position “no for naething.” But he slept profoundly, with only now and then a portentous long breath. He was the only unchanged one of the party,—the vicissitudes he had seen he had wanted sense to appreciate; and the three and a half years since I made his acquaintance might have been three and a half weeks, for all that appeared. Not so his master. I could see Mr. Collingwood very distinctly though he was a little further off than the rest; but he sat with one arm resting on the back of his chair, and his face thus turned towards me was thrown into full relief by his dark dress,—I thought I had never seen there so small an amount of health and spirits. It was not quite a year since his return from Bermuda and well I remembered noticing how much brightness of eye and manner had vanished before the experience of the previous year. But then there had been the joy of getting home, of being among friends again,—now his best friends were not, and from the next best he was going away. Yet never had he looked more characteristically like himself. I could not see the eyes, they were looking down; but the mouth wore a singularly sweet and almost child like expression of trustfulness—of the most absolute, grave submission,—submission as it seemed to me that regarded as much the future as the past. I wondered to myself what possible contingencies he could be contemplating. Apparently my father's revery had brought him back to the every-day walks of life, for his eyes suddenly came from the fire to me, and next took a very particular survey of each person present. Then quietly laying his hand upon Mr. Collingwood's shoulder, my father said, “Mr. Rodney, `there's a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will.'” Perhaps the person addressed thought the words conveyed some slight reproof, for he coloured a little as he looked up and replied, “I was not `rough-hewing' sir, believe me.” “When will you be through with your studies?” said my father abruptly. “Not for two years and more.” “And you will be living away from here all that time, Mr. Rodney!” I said despairingly. “Do you know how long you have been away already?” “I do indeed Gracie—better than you can.” “I don't know where the next two years will place us as they roll on,” said my father, “but so long as we are here —so long as we have a home any where Mr. Rodney, it is yours too. Will you remember my words?” “I could not forget them Mr. Howard,” he answered with one of his old looks of brightness and pleasure. But it changed immediately. “Then come to us whenever you can,” said my father. “When is your next time of leisure?” “Not for some months sir, and I shall be further off this year than I was the last. I cannot tell when you will see me again—I dare not promise myself that it will be soon —there may be several hindrances in my way.” “But you mustn't be hindered, Mr. Rodney,” I said,— “we shall want to see you so much.” “And as Grace says,” remarked Kate, “perhaps Wolfgang will get tired of us.” “I shall get tired of him if he does,” said Mr. Rodney. “No, that cannot be,—I fear the weariness will be on your side, if you often indulge him with such a place as he enjoys at present.” “It would have been unkind not to let him in to-night.” “And other nights”—I said,—“he is never in the way,— mamma was saying that only this morning—and papa is so fond of dogs!” “Well,” said Mr. Collingwood with a smile at my earnestness, “I am sure of Wolfgang's comfort; but remember Gracie, you have promised to let me know if any of you should wish him away.” “You may be quite easy on that point,” said my father. We were alone indeed when Mr. Rodney had gone. Not a friend in the neighbourhood for whom we cared much—not one; and it was fast becoming true that the neighbourhood cared little for us. We did not regret it that winter,—the sleighs that came were so loaded with fashions and entertainments and new buildings, the last arrivals of news from town and the arrivals that were daily expected,—we saw them drive off with pleasure. Mr. Ellis was always very welcome, but he was too far off and too busy to come often. We had taken Caddie back: partly because we could not bear to have her go to strangers, partly from the belief that Mrs. Howard's health would by no means endure such another time of exertion. And as my father said, “We had tried the experiment, and it didn't seem to make much difference—we might as well be comfortable while we could.” And that was a comfort, to the body at least; though perhaps it gave the mind more time to bethink itself. O hearts and affections! of what stuff are they made?— There was no feeling, no real loneliness in that distant churchyard; and yet when the weather changed for cold driving winds and winter storms, it gave me a pang—I never heard them without it; and even the snow had lost its charm, for I thought of it falling cold and thick upon Miss Easy's last resting-place. The solitude was not felt there, but it weighed upon me,—a constant, undefined pain that only declared itself as some bitter blast swept eddying round the house; or when we gathered about our little twilight fire, that shone more on the past than the present. The spring came—but its warm sun and springing vegetation had their contrasts,—it was like going to some old lookout point to see what changes a year had wrought in the landscape. Ah how many this time! and there was not a flower or a bird that did not speak of them. Kate and I had determined that the little rose-hedged garden should not be left to utter desolation—we could not bear the thought. Keep it in perfect order we could not, for it was too far away, but my stepmother agreed to walk there with us every afternoon, that at least the flowers might be kept trimmed and tied up, and the more flourishing weeds pulled away. It was a great pleasure to do this, —there was nothing in the garden with which we had not some association—that we did not love for Miss Easy's sake; and to spend upon her favourite plants some of the love we bore her, seemed almost a relief. Now and then my father went with us, and applied his strong hand and knife to the Cherokee rose, which had learned that it was a free country. We were there one day, smoothing the earth about the tulip and daffodil shoots, and watching the fair and sunny-faced crocuses that seemed almost to open wider as we looked at them, and Mrs. Howard stood watching us; when Ezra Barrington came tramping along the road, whistling his favourite “Hail Columby.” At sight of us he checked foot and voice together, and turning about walked up to the hedge. “Well!” he remarked, “that does go ahead of all I ever see or heerd tell on! You baint agoin to dig it up, be you?” “O no, we can't do that,” said Kate; “we are only making it look a little nice.” Ezra gave two or three nods of his head, and then stood in contemplative silence. “I reckon the posies would grow a deal better if there was a plough or sunthin 'nother run about amongst 'em?” he said at length. “Yes indeed,” I said, looking sadly at our insufficient top-dressing, “the ground wants much more done to it, but this is better than nothing.” And somewhat disheartened by the recollection how little better it was, I stooped down and began at another place. “I s'pose it wouldn't take me long to fix it,” said Ezra ruminating. “But you haven't time,” said Kate. “I s'pose I could find it,” he replied in the same meditative way,—“I never looked for anything yet I couldn't find, 'cept a four-leaved clover—and I don't believe that ever had existence, though my woman says she's seen 'em. Gracious! Miss Kate,” he added energetically, and surveying the little patch of ground with great contempt, “why if I had a team in here, I'd put through it afore you could say gee!” “But then the plough wouldn't do,” said I; “and digging is slower work.” “That's a fact!” said Mr. Barrington gravely. “I reckon I could ha' made that up by myself. Well—so long's all Mr. Carvill's work gets done 'tain't none o' his business what else I take a notion to,—a bit o' fun 'll do me as much good as other folks, I'm thinking. But look a here —I can't come down to this 'ere `ring o' roses' by myself, —there'd be the mischief to pay, and nothin to pay him with, neither.” “O we would come with you any time,” said I—“whenever you're ready,—and be so much obliged to you Mr. Barrington!” “That'll work then,” he answered: “'cause you see I don't know nothin about gimcracks, and I should dig some on 'em up for sartain. I can tell young oats with any man, but my wife says sun-flowers is quite different.” “And when will you come?” said Kate smiling. “Couldn't say,” said Ezra looking somewhat puzzled,— “my idees ain't begun to be made up on the subject. I'll stop down and tell ye. I s'pose Mr. Collingwood wouldn't have no objections? by rights he had ought to be asked. He'd like what was done by anythin of the name o' Howard, and no mistake; but the name o' Barrington you see's another guess sort o' chap.” “I am sure he would be pleased,” said Mrs. Howard with a smile. “Well—I guess likely,” said Ezra,—“it don't make much odds—only I'd as soon not get mad with him, for he's a leetle the smartest man I know.” The plan thus satisfactorily arranged was soon carried out, and Ezra's sturdy arm made almost as light of the matter as if the digging had been ploughing. And by the time that was done, he had got so interested in the work or the garden or us, as to spend many a grey morning hour in the wheat-field that he might have time to spare in the afternoon. He would interfere most watchfully to save our hands from briars, or to uproot some dock or mallows that had grown tall unperceived; but he never attempted the finer work; and would shake his head gravely over our raking, and profess that “we beat him gardening all to pieces!” And so tended, the garden flourished and looked gay and lovely as ever, save for the one shade that came from the closed and shuttered Venetian window. And the sweet spring wind that could there gain no admittance seemed to come sighing back to us, to tell of the different reception it had met in former years. It touched my heart so nearly, it found so ready an entrance there, that I could sometimes scarce work for weeping. Wolfgang always went with us, and would lie quietly on the grass or the gravel-walk, contributing his share of interest and association. “Miss Kate,” said Ezra one afternoon, as he gave the last blow to a support for a Lady Banks rose, “I hope there ain't much of the cat about me, as is always lookin into other people's cupboards; but don't you think this here garden could live along without you for a spell? I'd see that there didn't nothin mislist it.” “Why yes, I suppose so,” said Kate looking at him inquiringly. “'Cause that 'ere curiosity's exhibitin itself agin,” said Ezra, as he gave the stake a trial that embodied the spirit of two or three north-westers,—“and I reckoned you wouldn't care about seein it. 'Tain't likely I shall ever want to pull this up!” “Mr. Carvill?” said I. “I never see nothin else half so curious,” was the satisfactory reply. “Is he here now?” said Kate. “Come a shootin,” said Ezra. “But will he be likely to come in this direction?” “Couldn't say,” replied Mr. Barrington. “If you'd asked me where he wouldn't be Miss Kate, I could ha' telled ye, and that's to home,—walk over there any time o' day when you'd calculate to find him, and 'tain't likely you will. If he knowed as much as he thinks he does, he'd be down here straight.” “Why?” I said—“what makes you think so?” “Hum”—said Ezra,—“he likes to fire away at most anythin. He ain't quite a coon yet neither—so I thought likely he might take you and Miss Kate for pigeons.” It was impossible to make out Mr. Barrington's understanding of his own words, for his gravity was impenetrable;—but we thanked him for his information and resolved to profit by it. We did not indeed wish to meet Mr. Carvill; and not content with absenting ourselves from the garden, we set very short limits to our walks within our own grounds. Vain precaution! After a chill, cloudy day which had persuaded us to remain in the house, a few late sunbeams struggled forth, and Kate and I ran out to enjoy them. It was what the Irish call a “pretty” evening—soft and quiet; and wrapped in our shawls we rambled on from one walk to another, with no fear of intruders so near home. But it happened that at the same time, Mr. Carvill—whether belated or tired— had availed himself of a short road across our premises to his own; and we met him without even a moment's warning. As usual he had been after game, but this day had been unpropitious. His bag was empty, his dress looked wet, and himself a trifle discontented. Wolfgang knew him too well to bark, but the dignified growl and raising of the ears sufficiently marked his appreciation of the curiosity. “So,” said Mr. Carvill, stopping us short as we were 12 about to pass him with only a bow, “so young ladies, you have got Rodney's dog.” “Yes, for the present,” Kate said. “Slender piece of time, `the present'”—said Mr. Carvill, —“for the past, by your leave Miss Howard; and for the future I will take care of him.” “No sir,” Kate answered quietly, but with no concession in her voice. “I haven't an idea what `no sir' means—except in some circumstances”—said the gentleman in an under tone. “Is this the beginning of the `nineteen nay-says' Miss Howard?” “I hope fewer than that will content you Mr. Carvill,” replied Kate in the same cool and quiet manner. “Content go to the winds!” he said—“I'm like to have little of it. What's to hinder my taking the dog home with me now?” “I must leave that to yourself sir,—but I beg that you will not hinder our reaching home before nightfall.” And by a quick motion we passed him and walked on. But he turned and joined us, after a vain attempt to make Wolfgang follow him in another direction,—the dog most emphatically showed his teeth—thereby not sweetening Mr. Carvill's temper. “I've heard of `Love me, love my dog,'” he remarked— “never saw it acted out before! Am I to understand young ladies, that I alone am to be debarred from showing my affection to my absent brother?” The smile with which Kate had greeted Wolfgang's reappearance in front of her, gave place to a somewhat bright colour, but she made no reply. “Well!” said Mr. Carvill rather sulkily, “silence gives consent to something—I should like to know what! May I venture to inquire to whom the dog belongs? whether he is a general assignment or a special gage-d'amitié?—or is it a system of mutual trust? I know some people used to think it dangerous for ladies to walk alone.” “I shall believe it in future!” said Kate as she turned and confronted her tormentor. “Mr. Carvill—” He stopped and stood profoundly attentive. With such an air of deference too, of admiration, of amusement—it was hard to tell whether he was most glad to have roused her or most vexed that she had thwarted him. Kate hesitated, and the sparkling glance of her eye spent itself upon a tuft of violets. “Nothing you can say sir, will make any difference,” she went on,—“I wish you would understand that, once for all.” “Rather a mortifying thing to understand, too!” said Mr. Carvill—“perhaps on the whole, satisfactory. But Miss Howard, with all submission, if what I say really makes `no difference'—I believe I am dull, it does not occur to me why I may not have the pleasure of saying it.” “Because I am tired of the subject,” said Kate, “and don't mean to talk about it any longer.” “Tout de bon?” he replied,—“well—of course—if that be so—silence! But after all I think I am fairly entitled to an answer—your definitive Miss Howard. Am I to have the dog or no?” “Certainly not!” said Kate; “he is to stay with us till Mr. Collingwood comes for him.” “I wonder what else Mr. Collingwood will come for?” said Mr. Carvill impatiently turning away,—“I suppose he'll have it, whatever it is! Good bye young ladies— pray don't fail to guard Mr. Collingwood's dog with all care and tenderness—a proverb sometimes works both ways.”—And with steps that promised to give him the benefit of all the wet bushes in his way, our unneighbourly neighbour disappeared.
