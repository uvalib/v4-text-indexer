      <field name="fulltext">To JAMES FENNIMORE COOPER, AUTHOR OF THE “PIONEERS,” As a slight testimonial of admiration for Genius which calumny cannot obscure, Falsehood darken, or Time diminish, This work is respectfully inscribed by The Author.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SCENE OF THE ROMANCE. The incidents of the battle of the fourth of October, 1777, the evolutions of the opposing armies, the characteristics of the American partizan chief compared with the British officer, the manner of the fight of Germantown, the scene, the people, and the actors, the self-devotion of Washington, the daring feats of his compatriots—furnish the foundation, if not the superstructure of this Romance of Revolutionary History. To those who know nothing about the matter, it may seem a very easy task, to mould a correct and graphic history of a battle-field of the Revolution, from the rough block of history, marred by paradoxes and disfigured by contradictions. Yet those who have trodden the path of revolutionary romance, which is now essayed by the author, will emphatically corroborate one important fact, which the reader will do well to remember—that the history of all our battle-fields is shadowed by mystery and darkened by doubt; that there are innumerable contradictory narratives of a single event, that even the actors in the scenes of the American Revolution, have told varying stories of the great battles of the “eight years' war,” described them in a conflicting manner, and in some instances covered the whole subject with darkness and obscurity. With all these difficulties to encounter, the author has constructed the work now presented to the public. It is important for the reader to bear one prominent fact in remembrance. This work is not offered for perusal merely as an idle romance, but as a dramatic and legendary history of the battle, prepared from the details of various accredited written histories, the narratives of survivors of the field, as well as the thousand wild legends of the fight of Germantown, current in the vicinity of the battle-field. It may not be impertinent to remark in this place, that the first edition of this romance, was received when published in six periodical numbers, in a standard journal, with popular favor as signal as it was unexpected. Extensively copied, it was returned to the author from all quarters of the Union, transferred into the columns of some of the most noted journals of the land. This mark of popular favor induced the present publisher to offer the book to the public in a more substantial form. It will be succeeded by a much more voluminous romance (the scene of which is laid on the field of a battle no less celebrated than Germantown) entitled— BLANCHE OF BRANDYWINE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK THE FIRST. THE WISSAHIKON. CHAPTER THE FIRST. THE QUAKER AND HIS DAME. “These be troublous times, dame—these be troublous times,” said the Quaker as he took his pipe from his mouth, and drew his chair nearer to the cheerful flame that blazed upon the hearth. “The October night is cool—and verily the fire is comfortable. I mind me not of a season, when the month opened with such a nipping frost—and yet the woods of the quiet Wissahikon are scarce faded by it. These are troublous times—does thee not think so, Hannah?” “Yes, Joab,” replied the Quaker dame, smoothing a crease out of her apron with her hand: “I do think that the times are full of trouble. What with the men of war, with their flaunting red dresses, with their war horses and their shouting, their cymbals and their drums, their cannons and their weapons of war; our quiet home on the Wissahikon, is a quiet home no longer. But as the Lord wills it, so let it be!” The Quaker farmer took his pipe from his mouth, sent a volume of tobacco-smoke rolling to the rafters of the apartment, and then with a distinct “hem” resumed his meditative luxury again. “Verily, Joab, there is not a window of our habitation, from which we may look, without seeing the tents of these men of strife. Well do I remember the time when first thee took me to be thy wedded wife; then thee was used to go peacefully to the field, to thy labor in the morning, and I could bake my bread, and scour my pewter in quietness, without a great big, idle fellow of a soldier, popping into our tenement, and taking what he pleased for his own, and looking at our daughter Marjorie as though he meant no good. Well do I mind me of the time—but was thee not over to Germantown this afternoon, Joab?” The Quaker nodded assent. “Did thee hear any thing new of the man Cornwallis, or aught of George Washington?” “I found the village people much affrighted. Some were removing their worldly goods, some were talking loudly and calling their neighbors `Whig' and `Tory,' and all were running to and fro, in great confusion and bustle. I asked what all this meant—and verily the village people answered, that the man Cornwallis, who has posted his scarlet men, across the village, near the mansion of friend Chew, to the Delaware on one side, and through our quiet woods along to the Wissahikon on the other, did purpose some mischief to the men of friend Washington. But I couldn't get head nor tail of the story. But of a certainty shall we have trouble shortly, Hannah.” “I fear thee speakest that which shall come to pass, Joab,” replied the dame, and then both farmer and his wife appeared to give themselves up to the melancholy contemplation of the evils predicted. The whole scene was one of Pennsylvania's olden time. The blazing light of the hickory fire, flickering round the apartment, showing the substantial forms of the Quaker and his dame, in bold relief, and mingling with the beams of the setting sun, which streamed through the deep silled window; the massive rafters which formed the ceiling of the spacious room; the snow-white walls and neatly sanded floor; the oaken table in one corner; the shelves heavy with masses of burnished pewter,— all were characteristic of that quiet, domestic life, so rarely discovered in any place, save under the green trees and pleasant shade of the country. The farmer was in the prime of vigorous manhood, with features of massive solidity, a broad and low forehead, a short, square nose, a wide mouth with thin lips, prominent chin, high cheek bones and a dark grey sparkling eye; and with a frame of great muscular power, and physical strength, long and sinewy arms, and prominent chest whose ample development his Quaker garb, with all its volume, and want of shape, could not altogether conceal. You would have picked him out in a crowd, as the man to head a charge of dragoons, rather than suppose him the quiet Friend, whose theory and practice alike shunned the noise and bustle of war. His dame was full and portly in figure, with a calm, placid face, and light blue eyes, expressive of a mild and domestic disposition. Her hair was half concealed, by the plain cap of the Quaker sect, and her gown was modelled with the invariable simplicity of hue and shape, peculiar to the sisters of the peace-loving and form-shunning society. “In truth, Hannah,” exclaimed Joab after a pause, as he laid down his pipe and extending his hands to receive the cheerful warmth of the flame, he gazed with a complacent glance around the spacious arch of the fire-place. “In truth, Hannah, we have fallen upon evil times. The sword of war hangs over the land, the dust of the highways is laid with the blood of our neighbors and worldly friends, and the quiet streams run crimson, with the butchery of the men of strife. This war parts father and son, husband and wife, mother and child.” “Yes,” responded Hannah, from the other side of the fire-place. “There is the rich Englishman Tracy, whose mansion is pitched on the rock that looks down into the vale of the Wissahikon, beyond the bend 'tother side of Rittenhouse's Mill—did he not cast his son from him as though he were unworthy of all fatherly love and affection, because he favored the men of George Washington? Marry, Joab, I often wonder what has become of the poor youth, who hath his father's curse upon him?” “I learned 'tother day, from some friends of Washington, that Herbert Tracy, that delicately reared youth, joined the Continentals last winter, with a number of his father's tenants; and I likewise learned that he endured the biting cold as bravely, and slept on the bare earth as cheerfully, as the humblest of Washington's people. The son of our neighbor—Henry Heft, commonly called Harry Heft, was with the young man Tracy.” The last sentence was uttered by the Quaker, with a covert glance at the countenance of his dame, as though he expected the name of the young farmer to excite some interest in her mind. He was not disappointed, for the Quakeress gave a quick, nervous start, and exclaimed, with the rapid and hurried manner, peculiar to the keenest anxiety —“Joab, what didst thee hear of the young man Heft? Surely he has met with no harm? He was a good youth, albeit somewhat wild. Why did thee not tell me of this sooner? I should be sorry where harm to come to him, for, for—” “For he hath made offers of marriage to our daughter Marjorie, thee would say? Nay, nay, dame, were he alive and well, standing at this moment before me, he might not unite his lot with our child. There was a time when I had hope of the boy, when I thought he would be one of us, and assume the peaceful garb of the Friends—but no sooner did young Tracy go to the wars, than Harry must be off also, and fight, and cut and thrust, I warrant thee, with the worst of them. Nay, nay, Hannah—” “Well, if it must be so, it must. I fear thee speakest truth. But in verity it is painful to think how much trouble and strife among kindred and friends, this dreadful war hath caused. There was the daughter of old Waltham, whose country seat is on the Ridge Road near the Falls of Schuylkill; he is rich, and full of worldly goods, thee knowest Joab: she, the maiden his daughter, was to be married to young Tracy, when the quarrel occurred between father and son, and the match was broken off. Ah, me! 'tis a troublous time, for the sons of men, Joab.” But at this moment, as if some unexpected thought had ruffled the usual serenity of his mind, the Quaker rose from his seat, and walked hurriedly to the deep silled window of the apartment looking to the west, and gazing upon landscape of hill, valley and stream, for a moment he seemed lost in thought, or wrapt in the mild quietude, that attends the contemplation of a lovely sunset, to a mind sobered by age and experience. CHAPTER THE SECOND. THE MAIDEN. The view was full of natural beauty. Immediately in front of the window extended a small flower garden, surrounded by a wicket fence, made lovely to the eye by groups of wild flowers of every tint and hue, green arbors, overshadowed by luxuriant vines, transplanted by a fair hand from the glades of the forest, and pleasant walks, and winding paths, separated from the flower beds by delicate lines of greenest grass, while a fair form flitting from arbor to arbor, might well have seemed the divinity of the rural paradise. Beyond the garden, a sloping pasturage some hundred yards in extent, bounded on either side by forest trees, sank down in a gentle descent until its verdant turf was laved by the ripples of the quiet Wissahikon; which flowed silently on, from a mass of greenwood, along the shores of the meadow, under the shade of the trees on the opposite bank, until it was lost in the forest of verdure which terminated the view to the south. The opposite bank of the stream arose in a swelling hill, covered with lofty forest trees, the giant-turnked oak, the leafy chestnut, and branching beech, whose luxuriant foliage, but faintly tinged by the bright red, and glaring yellow of autumn, was basking in the mellowing light of the setting sun, as he sank with half concealed disc behind the woodlands. The sky was clear and serene, with light masses of clouds floating in the pathway of the sun. The whole western horizon was bathed in light of mellowed gold, while the zenith expanded with its intensity of autumnal azure—like the dome of this fair temple of nature—far,far above, and there was a holy quietude, a twilight solemnity resting upon that world-hidden vale, that appealed to the highest and kindliest feelings of our nature. The view was lovely, the foliage luxuriant, the sky serene, the meadow verdant as with the first kiss of spring, but neither view, foliage, sky nor pasturage, seemed to attract the attention of the farmer by reason of their mere natural beauties, but rather from some association of memory, which fixed the valley of the Wissahikon as the scene of some well remembered incident of other days. Joab gazed for an instant upon this scene, and then turning away with a hurried step, sought the other window of the apartment, which opened a view to the north. There were undulating hills and green woodlands and brown fields of upturned earth and white patches of ripe buckwheat, but upon hill top, and gleaming from the foliage of the forest, and dotting the russet of the cultivated fields with strips of white, extended the tents of the British camp, traversing as far as the eye could reach, the tract of country between the village of Germantown and the river Schuylkill, while at short intervals waved the Cross of St. George, stained with the best blood of the children of the soil; and the hirelings of power, in their gaudy trappings, with their well burnished arms, were observed moving hither and thither along the line of the encampment. The view did not by any means seem to soothe the mind of the Quaker, into its usual quietude. “I tell thee, wife, it is in vain—in vain!” he exclaimed again turning to the window looking out upon the Wissahikon. “I cannot stifle the remembrance. I stood here—here at this window, and saw him die—and yet I had a hand, a strong hand and a stout arm, but I might not strike. I beheld him die—” “Of whom does thee speak, Joab?” asked dame Hannah, amazed at the excited demeanor of the staid Quaker. “Methinks thee is wondrously flurried, Joab!” “Here I beheld him die. The son of the poor widow over the creek—that poor trumpeter boy in the American camp,” he continued, his manner becoming more excited as he proceeded. “It was just such an evening as this, save that it happened in the bloom of spring. He had won his way through the hosts of the enemy—he had heard his mother was sick unto death—and he wished if she was indeed dying to close her eyes. He had won his way through the hosts of the enemy, he had gained this meadow, when thundering at his back came the scarlet men of war on their stout horses, with their flashing swords. He shrieked for mercy and I heard his shriek, but might not, could not save him. He shrieked for mercy, and their swords were bathed in the warm blood of his heart. He was a fair youth, but 'twas a ghastly sight—that ruddy cheek crusted in the cold blood; those golden locks dyed in crimson red. Ah, 'twas a fearful sight—and—I—could not save him—” “In verity 'twas a most pitiful sight! The Lord have mercy on his murderers!” “I could not—could not save him”—continued the Quaker. “But still I beheld him die!” He raised his eyes and hands to Heaven. “Father of mercy”—he exclaimed—“if blood crying from the earth to thee for recompense, is ever in thy wisdom avenged, surely the account of these scarlet men is deeply dyed, and cries for ten fold vengeance! He was but a boy and yet they killed him!” “'Twas a dreadful sight—a doleful sight,” sobbed dame Hannah. “In truth a doleful sight! The Lord be good to us, what is that?” she exclaimed, with an outburst of surprise, as a loud and piercing shriek arose from the garden without, and rang through the farm house. The Quaker started quickly at the sound, but ere he had time to move a step or whisper a word, the sound of hurried footsteps was heard, the door of the apartment was flung hurriedly open, and a girl in the full summer of youth, rushed into the room, her dark hair floating in masses of jet, down over her neck and shoulders, and streaming in unconfined luxuriance over her virgin bosom, bared by the hand of violence. As she rushed into the room, she was followed by a coarse, ruffian-like man in the dress of a British dragoon, who with a drunken shout, and look of imbecile intoxication, had seized on the 'kerchief which veiled her bosom, and while she fled to her father's arms, pursued her footsteps. “Save me!—Father—save me!” cried the maiden clinging to the farmer's neck. “Come my pretty lassie—don't be afraid”—exclaimed the drunken soldier, as he sprang across the floor with unsteady steps. “Don't be afraid, lassie —don't—” “Come, feller, this is going a little too far”—exclaimed a strange voice, and a blow from behind felled the soldier to the oaken planks of the floor. It was a good stout blow, and it laid the crimson-hued dragoon, as quietly down, as a new born babe. The Quaker who had not time to raise a hand in defence of the maiden, glanced at the stranger and beheld the form of a young man in the prime of early manhood, of a strong, muscular and well proportioned frame, with a face full of honest intelligence of expression, lighted by the gleam of a dare devil eye, and a look beaming with ingenuous frankness and manly courage. “That's a nice specimen of the terror of turkey cocks!” exclaimed the stranger, eyeing the prostrated soldier, with a gaze of quiet admiration. “A nice pattern of a scare crow to keep turkey gobblers out of the corn! Haint it, uncle Joab? What d'ye say, aunt Hannah?—did ever you see sich a beast?” “Harry Heft!” exclaimed the maiden in surprise, while her cheek was pale with her recent affright. “Harry Heft!” “Henry Heft! And in this warlike guise!” exclaimed the farmer, participating in the astonishment of his daughter. “Why, Henry Heft! Where did thee come from?” said the dame, in a tone of quiet amazement, as her lips parted and her eyes distended with surprise. The scene would have made a picture. The staid Joab, with his daughter resting on his right arm, while the other was raised in involuntary astonishment; the fair girl with her arms round her father's neck, her dark hair falling in disordered tresses over her shoulders and down her back, her face, with beaming eyes as dark as night, and dimmed by tears, turned toward the young soldier, while her bared bosom of virgin whiteness, and youthful outline, heaved upward in the light, and glowed with the warm flush that brightened over her face and neck; the dame slightly in the background with hands raised and eyes distended; and the young soldier in the foreground, unheeding the exclamations of surprise, but gazing downward, with his sparkling brown eyes, fixed in an expression of quiet humor, upon the form of the insensible dragoon, laid along the floor, in the careless attitude of helpless intoxication; all formed a quiet picture for the pencil of John Smith, or any other artist of similar celebrity. “Reely, jist to think of the feller's impudence!” exclaimed Harry Heft—“a'ter I'd travelled fifteen miles, over hill and holler, and through the red-coat lines, not at all mentionin' my creepin' down the Wissahikon to get cleer of the picquets—a'ter all this trouble to get a look at Majorie there, and then when I reach the garden gate, to find that feller a-chaseing her about the flower beds jist as if he'd a right to catch butterflies where he liked!” “But where did thee come from, Henry? How did thee git here? Is'nt thee in danger? What does thee want?” were the hurried questions asked by the Quaker, who evidently knew not what to think of young Heft's sudden appearance. “That's what I call unrollin' the whole catechism at once. Now uncle—I call you uncle, not because you're my fa'ther's brother, but because it sounds sociable, (the same to you, aunt,) jist set down there while I shut the door. There—it's bolted, now let me roll this sleepin' scarecrow under the table. Majorie, dear, let me put your 'kerchief round your neck. There now—what's the use of blushing so— did'nt I pay the scoundrel for his impu'dence?— Now all of you sit down 'round the fire-place, jist as we used to do in old times—Majorie, you sit by me—uncle, you sit there, and aunt, you sit there.— Now then I'll tell you all about it!” “Henry, wherefore is thee in this warlike guise?” interrupted the Quaker. “That's what I was jist a-going to tell you. But howsomever as I've precious little time to spare, I'll jist cut a long story short, and let you know, that I'm fresh from George Washington's army— which is not much farther off than the Skippack Creek, some sixteen miles distance from this farm house. (The Continentals may be a little nearer for all you know.) I'm on a scouting party—but p'raps you don't know what that is? You do uncle! very well.” “Where did thee go when thee left the Wissahikon last winter with young Herbert Tracy?” “Why you must know that young Tracy raised a company of mounted riflemen, from round about the country here with whom he joined the Continentals. He mustered some fifty good, bold-handed, stout-hearted fellows. This is our uniform—black frock coat, or rather dark grey—neat little rifle with a ball that never fails—short sword —powder horn,—light boots—cap with the feather of a night-hawk in the way of a plume, and that's the reason why they calls us the night-hawks, though our regular name is Captain Tracy's Rifles, or the Black Rangers. We fight sometimes one by one dropped about in spots, and most ginerally we slam into the Britishers all in a bunch, with our rifles cracking away, our plump black horses at the top of their speed, and our jolly war-hurrah splitting the air over our heads. We've seen hard fighting too—plenty of it. Twenty-six of our good band left their bones at Brandywine. By the Lord above us—” “Henry, Henry! What saith the scripture?— Take not the name of—” “I'm wrong, I know it. But these haint no times for men to be pertikler about what they say. But to the pint. I came as far as Chestnut Hill on a scouting party, and then I came on here, through the British lines, partly to see you folks here— partly to see my people over the creek, but more 'specially to reconnoitre round the mansion of our captain's father, jist below the paper mill run. Captain Tracy thinks there's some mischief a-brewing, and so I'll jist take a bit of something to eat if you please, and be off. What's that red-coat grumbling there about? He is the drunkenest—” “If I mistake not,” interrupted Joab, “he is the servant of a young British officer, who with Colonel Musgrave is at present staying at Mr. Tracy's down the Wissahikon.” “Hey, uncle! You don't say so! Then there's mischief brewin' indeed,—Colonel Musgrave and old Tracy have always been as thick as thieves.— It's my opinion that the captain's father is going to marry that Britisher's nephew of his to young Miss Waltham, who was betrothed to our captain before he joined the Continentals.” “Who is his nephew? I never heard him spoken of before, Henry.” “Why, his name is Wellwood Tracy—he's a Britisher born, and he's a leftenant among the red-coats. Old Tracy says that he shall inherit his estate when he dies. There's a father for you, to cast off his natural born son—but what's that fellow grumbling about?” “This way, this way,” muttered the intoxicated dragoon, raising himself from his resting place under the table and gazing around with a vacant stare, which showed that his thoughts were not at all connected with the scene before him. “This way—parson—it isn't far. Two miles only along the Wissahikon. You know where old Tracy lives? They're to be married at eight o'clock— 2 fine fun—plenty of drink—the leftenant's a glorious fellow. Hurrah—at 'em.” And then the drunken soldier performed various imaginary feats, rode over imaginary regiments of Continentals, emptied imaginary bottles, and sang very peculiar poetical selections. “Very well, my feller—very well,” exclaimed Harry Heft, looking complacently at the muttering soldier. “Very well—that's jist what I wanted to know. See here, Marjorie.” Drawing the blushing girl apart, Harry whispered in her ear, in a low voice, words which gave a brighter sparkle to her dark black eyes, and brought a livelier blush upon her budding cheek. “What d'ye think o' the plan, Marjorie?” “Verily,” replied the damsel, “verily, Harry, I think,” she continued hesitatingly. “That is I like it very well, but—but,” the rest of her reply was lost in a whisper. “Henry, what did thee say to our daughter?” exclaimed the sedate Quaker. “Really, it seemeth to me—” “Never mind, uncle—nothing wrong—nothing wrong. Hist! there is the signal of my comrade down in the hollow. I must be off, but I'll not say good bye, for dead or alive you'll hear from me soon. Now for old Tracy and old Waltham!” As he said this the young Ranger seized his rifle from the fire-place and rushed out of the room, as a clear shrill whistle was heard without, leaving the black eyed Marjorie to explain the purport of those whispered words as best she might. The plan of my story makes it necessary to picture to the reader two distinct scenes or incidents which occurred on the same evening of the commencement of the tale, at the hour of sunset in the country around the village of Germantown. Now for the first incident. CHAPTER THE THIRD. THE BLACK RANGERS. As the last gleam of sunset glanced through the foliage of a long line of towering elm and chestnut trees, whose luxuriant verdure marked the course of a winding bye road, some three miles north of Chestnut Hill, a party of soldiers were pursuing their way, under the interlacing boughs, that made a pastoral arcade of the serpentine lane, and shielded their path and persons from any intrusive observer. The soldiers, numbering some twenty-five in all, were mounted each on a stout and well limbed steed, black in hue, with flowing mane and tail. Their tall and sinewy forms were clad in a costume which, peculiar to their body, would have marked them out for observation amid the gaudy trappings of a numerous army. They wore black coats, reaching to the knee, and fitting closely over their prominent and muscular chests, and varied in appearance by a border of black fur around the skirt of the garment, with a plain line of braiding running up in front, until it was terminated by the simple upright collar, buttoning closely round the neck. A belt of dark leather, from which depended a powder horn, was slung across the breast; another belt of similar material girdled the waist, supporting the scabbard of a short straight sword; while a glittering hunting knife, with handle of the wild deer's antlers, depended from the right side; and a small rifle, with barrel of elegant finish and stock of mahogany, varied by ornaments of silver, hung at the saddle-bow of each soldier. On the head, each rifleman wore a small circular fur cap, with a feather of the night-hawk, drooped to the left side, to supply the place of a plume. Their legs were encased as far as the knees, in well fiting black boots, displaying the manly proportions of each muscular leg, the bend below the knee, the prominent calf and sloping ankle, to every advantage. Each man of the party was tall, broad chested, and well proportioned, and each bore upon his scarred and rugged features, the marks of the spear thrust, the sword cut, and the bullet wound. They were such men as would have delighted the heart of a crusading knight of the thirteenth century, with all the wild love of adventure—all the daring courage, and all the frank, hardy qualities which mark the soldier, who—as the old writer phrases it—“fight for his own hand” independent of the great body of an army. And then they sat on their steeds so well, so gallantly; each ranger riding firm and erect, adapting his limbs to the movement of the horse, and guiding him without having any recourse to the bridle. It would have been no easy matter to have picked men of such form, strength and stature from a regiment of common soldiers, yet the leader of the Black Rangers, who rode at their head, was to all appearances, as much superior in all these, as well as many other qualities to his own gallant band, as they were superior to the promiscuous gatherings of an army. Tall in stature, with a form moulded with the outline of physical power softened by the gentler proportions of manly grace, an air and beauty that marked him out from the mass of common men, a face warmed with the glow of youth, yet impressed with the indelible lines of thought, Herbert Arnheim Tracy was in every point of view worthy of his reputation (won in the short compass of a year) of being one of the bravest among the brave, the first in the storm, the foremost in the charge, the most untiring in the pursuit, and as obnoxious to the enemy in the retreat as in the chase. His face impressed the observer with a high idea of the intellect expressed in each lineament. His forehead, high and pale, and bearing the wrinkles of thought, was relieved by his raven black hair which fell in luxuriant locks almost to his shoulders. His eyes, of that deep and thoughtful blackness which is ever accompanied by strong mental powers, shone like coals of the living flame from under his strongly marked and arching eyebrows, with a clear, steady glance, that told of old memories stirring up within him, and prospects of the dim future agitating the depths of his mind. His nose was small and Grecian, his mouth a thought too wide, with thin, expressive lips; his chin was small prominent square and decided in its outline, while the general contour of his face was in harmony with the regular lines of manly beauty. As to his dress, he wore the uniform of his band, the black frock coat, edged with fur; the boots of a similar hue; the small sword was suspended from his left side; the hunting knife was inserted in his belt, and a small chain of burnished steel passed over his left shoulder, supported a light hunting horn of silver, rimmed with gold, which ever hung ready for immediate use under his right arm. In place of the feather of the night-hawk worn by his men, his cap wore in front a long drooping plume of eagles' feathers, which fell to one side, and mingled with the luxuriant locks of his raven hair. Had you seen Captain Herbert Tracy's mind as he then rode along the sequestered lane, at the head of his gallant band, you would have discovered many a bitter thought sweeping athwart the surface of his soul, mingling with many a memory of olden time, many a dreary imagining of future doom, and many a thought of those he loved, who loved him not, and many a musing of one who returned his affection with a deep and burning passion. A dream, a bright reverie of his early days was now present with his fancy, and the sunny glades and the shady recesses of the Wissahikon were again around him, and again he wandered through the forests that overlooked the world-hidden stream, arm in arm with that father, from whose heart and home he was now a stranger and an outcast. And then came the memory of the bitter day, when that father's curse rang in his ears. There was the small library-room in which the dreamings of his boyhood had been fed with the additional fancies from the perusal of the tomes of romance. The dull light of a November day came through the solitary window of the apartment, and again, with words of eloquent persuasion, his father, by birth an Englishman, and a Loyalist from principle, endeavored to convince his son of the rectitude of the cause of Royalty and its intimate connection with his future pursuits and expectations. For after a life of voluntary exile from his native land, after burying his mind and talents for years amid the shades of the Wissahikon, while his heart was eating itself away with deep broodings of one of the last descendants of an honored line, condemned to comparative penury, Major Herbert Wallingford Tracy found himself suddenly placed by the death of various intermediate heirs, but one remove from the Earldom of Wallingford, whose domains were located in one of the fairest counties of England, where his ancestors, a long and honored line, had lived and flourished since the Conquest. On the death of the present aged and childless Earl, Major Tracy would become Earl of Wallingford, and his son, whose strong innate powers he had often noted with all a parent's love, would, after his decease, succeed to the title and estates of the ancient house, to add, as the father hoped, renewed glory and increased honor to the records of the venerable line. But all his hopes, the hopes of a bold, a strong minded, and worldly ambitious man, soured by the disappointments of youth into a misanthrope, were met at the very outset, by the plain, candid, and fearless declaration of his son, that he could not draw his sword against the land that gave him birth. And then, wound up to a pitch of madness, by this utter prostration of all his ambitious dreams,— for Major Tracy had thought to win royal favor for his son, by the devotion of his influence and his sword to the cause of royalty,—the father raised his hand to heaven, and with unquivering lip and steady eye, cursed that son of all his hopes, and then thrust him, like an unclean thing, from the home of his infancy and the side of his betrothed. Her father, Mr. Waltham, had refused to consummate 2* the marriage of his daughter with an outcast, and pour his well filled coffers at the feet of one, who was a rebel in his opinion—not to his royal majesty George the Third—but, what was a matter of much greater consequence, “to the rich Squire Waltham,” a rebel to all that was high and holy in religion or nature; or, in other words, that Herbert Arnheim Tracy was a poor man. When Herbert departed from the mansion of his infancy, it was with the determination to join the banner of Washington. A small fortune bequeathed to him by a distant relative in Philadelphia, which he was now enabled to claim, having just attained his majority, afforded him the means of fitting out a band of brave farmers' sons, who had known him from his infancy, and other gallant spirits, and embodying them in a band which soon became widely known as Captain Tracy's Mounted Rifles, the Night Hawks or the Black Rangers. In less than a year he had gained honor and renown, and now, after an absence from the home of his childhood of that duration, he found himself returning toward the wilds of the Wissahikon, with the thought of his father's curse hanging heavy over his soul, and dismal forebodings of the future fate of his betrothed, giving a melancholy tinge to all his feelings and fancies. His meditations were interrupted by the voice of a war worn veteran at his side. He was a soldier of a quarter of a century's growth, and had served under Braddock in the old French wars. “We shall have warm work of it to-morrow— Cap'in.” “Aye, Sergeant, we shall have warm work, most certainly.” “Trust our band will remember our trumpeter boy, Capt'in.” “He who was murdered some months since, you mean? Our band of gallant fellows will never forget the massacre of the young trumpeter, Sergeant Brown. How far do you think we are from the British camp, Sergeant?” “'Bout five miles, Capt'in; three miles to Chestnut Hill, and two from thence to Chew's House, which I larn is the location of the Britishers' campment.” “It must be about five miles then, to the Paper Mill Run on the Wissahikon?” “Jist the same, Capt'in.” “Do you think it will be possible, Sergeant, to pass the British lines, and reach the Run within an hour's time?” “Possible and impossible, Capt'in, jist as you take it. If you take the bed of the Wissahikon, and pass the Britishers under cover of the brushwood, 'long side of it—that's what I call possible, and you'll succeed. If you try any other ways— that's what I call impossible, and you'll not succeed, but you will get shot. But what is that thing bowin' and scrapin' yonder?” Herbert looked in the direction pointed out by the Sergeant, and discovered a singular figure, bowing and posturing after a most curious fashion, at the distance of some twenty paces; directly in the centre of the lane, in front of the Rangers' pathway. On approaching nearer to this singular figure, it resolved itself into a short, broad-shouldered negro, with an exceedingly large black face, flat nose, thick lips and prominent chin, large eyes with very small pupils, and very large “whites;” hips and shin-bones of tremendous prominence, feet of colossal size, and general figure as grotesque in outline, and as ludicrous in proportion, as though Nature had turned caricaturist, and manufactured a walking libel upon the whole monkey tribe. “Massa Herbert, Massa Herbert—” exclaimed the negro, making a profound bow as the Rangers approached—“If dar ar be you jest say so, for gorra-mighty, Lord bless us, dis nigger am tired— dat am a fac. I'b been hunting you, eber since yesterday mornin', way up to de Skippack creek, sixteen miles from here, as true as my name am Charles de Fust, and I hab'ent found you till dis berry instant. De berry debbil's to pay at home, and no pitch hot.” “Why, Charley! is that you!” cried Captain Tracy, as he recognized one of his father's domestics in the negro, “what message have you got for me? Who sent you?” “Dar's de message I hab for you, and Miss Marian Waltham sent me. True as my name's Charles de Fust.” Herbert took the carefully folded note from the hands of the negro, and, with a beating heart, recognized the handwriting of his betrothed in the simple direction—“To Captain Herbert Arnheim Tracy.” With a nervous hand he broke open the seal, and read— October 2, 1777. Dearest Herbert—I am in great distress, and hemmed in by the most fearful dangers. If you have any regard for our mutual love, our mutual fate, come to me; come to me as soon as you have read these lines. Nothing but your presence can avert the fate of— Your betrothed, Marian. “God of Heaven!” exclaimed Tracy, as his cheek grew for a moment lividly pale—“the letter is dated yesterday, and yet, Charles, you have failed to deliver it until this moment. Tell me, sirrah,” he continued, raising himself in his stirrups, as his eye flashed with anger—“Wherefore this neglect? Answer me truly, or by the God that lives, the next tree and a strong cord shall be yours!” “Gorra-mighty, Lord bless us, sure as my name's Charles de Fust,” stammered the negro, half frightened out of his wits as he stood bowing in front of Herbert's horse. “Massa Herbert, what's de use ob workin' yusef in a passhun? Dese am de facts ob de case. Two days ago, Massa Waltham, who libs on de Ridge Road, came ober to Major Tracy's on a visit. Brought Miss Marian wid him—and de old fellow was seized by paralytic stroke while at the Major's—t'ought he was going to die—den him and your fader make up match between his darter and dat red coat scamp, Leftenant Wellwood Tracy. Under dem circumstances Miss Marian dispatch me off, wid dis note for you. Went up to deSkippack —could n't find you dar. Dey sed you was gone out a scouting. Been a follering you up eber since—and here I be, and dere you are, and Miss Marian's goin' to be married to dat renegate dis ebenin'. So if you gwain to do anyting, you better do it mighty dam quick. Sure's my name's Charles de Fust.” “Sergeant,” cried Herbert, turning hurriedly to the veteran Brown, who rode at his elbow.— “You know the place of rendezvous? The deserted mansion among the copse of horse chestnut trees, about a quarter of a mile hence?” “The place called the Haunted House?” “The same. Let the Rangers disperse in every direction in search of intelligence as regards the force, numbers, and position of the enemy. We meet again at twelve to-night at the Haunted House. It is now dark—disperse the Rangers, Sergeant!” The Sergeant touched his hat, and presently the Rangers were seen disappearing in various directions. “Charles de Fust” was left standing alone with the Captain. “They have a desperate game to play,” Herbert muttered in a whisper, that came through his clenched teeth. “She is mine—mine by all that is sacred. Wo be to him who shall say me nay!— By the God that lives—” The oath was scattered to the air, and the astonished negro beheld Herbert plunging the spurs into the sides of his ebon steed, who swept through field and meadow with the speed of wind, and in an instant was lost in the shades of a neighboring forest. “Dat am berry perlite! Berry! To leave me all alone here in de middle ob de road! Berry perlite; —Gorra-mighty, Lord bless us—sure's my name's Charles de Fust!” CHAPTER THE FOURTH THE BETROTHED. She gazed upon that gorgeous sunset, the beautiful girl! She gazed from the arching window of her chamber, at the setting sun, with her beaming face flushed into brighter radiance with the last glimpse of daylight—her soft blue eyes dimmed with bursting tears—her pouting lips of most delicious voluptuousness of shape, parted by the rising sigh—and her golden hued hair, floating in glossy richness down each budding cheek, and along her arching neck, and finally resting in beautiful disorder upon that virgin bosom, with its veins of azure and its outline of youth and bloom. The beauty of Marian Waltham was of that fascinating character which so finely and delicately blends the spiritual with the material, and charms the beholder with a glance, a look, or a tone;— which enchains the fancy with every motion and attracts the imagination in every attitude, throwing the golden light of romance around the fair form— giving a brighter glance to the eye, a lovelier hue to the velvet cheek, and a winning sweetness to the tone, which seems to convey every idea of the hidden soul that words of human speech may fail to utter. Lovely as Marian was at all times, she certainly never seemed more beautiful than on this eventful evening, when gazing at the last beams of sunset, from the spacious window of her chamber, situated in the western wing of Major Tracy's mansion, among the heights of the Wissahikon. Her face, raised gently upward, received on each glowing cheek, the soft flush of sunset; her eyes, her large blue, lustrous orbs, half closed in dreaming thought, were impearled in a starting tear; her mouth, with its small lips curving with a fascinating fulness, was slightly opened with the listlessness of reverie: her full rounded chin, sank with all the richness of flowing outline into the arching neck with its clear transparent hue, and around the Grecian head, along each budding cheek, and over her neck and shoulder streamed the luxuriant locks of her waving hair, whose bright and silky gold, glistening in the sunbeams, completed the fascination that hovered round her beauty like a veil of light. Her bust was ample, well proportioned, and swelling in its outline, yet delicately formed and full of virgin beauty; her waist small and tapering, yet without any appearance of unnatural confinement or artificial restraint; while from her waist downward the proportions of her fignre fell in a voluptuous sweep, which gave indefinable fascination to every motion of those small and softly chiselled feet, whose fairy tracery of form peeped from beneath the snow-white folds of the bridal robe. And those arms, full, fair, and rounded with the floating line of grace, bared from the shoulder with their beauty gleaming through the bewitching sleeves of air-like lace, and the delicate hands with miniature fingers half clasped in front supporting the golden bracelet, which the maiden was about to entwine around that wrist which needed no such garish ornament; all these charms—the face, the floating hair, the half thoughtful, half dreaming attitude, the air of winning innocence, the innocence that implies ignorance of the world's customs, which encircled the maiden's features—all combined, made her seem to the fascinated eye, pure as she was, a being to be loved with all the depth of the passion that springs from a high intellect, a being whose entire soul, with all its gentle and modest affections would dissolve in deep and lasting love, for the object of her choice. Marian turned from the bright sunset and gazed around her chamber. Ever since the intimate friendship of Major Tracy and Squire Waltham had given rise to frequent visits to the mansion of the former, this chamber had been set apart for Marian and furnished to her taste. The furniture was attractive without being gorgeous. The chamber looked precisely the same as on the day when the fair Marian first retired within its precincts to muse on the gallant youth, who had saved her life, endangered by a wild and untamed horse, who rushed with herself and father over a precipice, and plunged them into the waters of the Wissahikon. She even now imagined the noble form of Herbert, confronting the maddened horse, and when his efforts to stay the speed of the animal were in vain, again the picture was colored by her fancy, how gallantly he sprang into the depths of the rivulet and drew her fainting form and that of her dying father to the shore. All this, and the subsequent scenes of the confession of his love, her acknowledgment of a mutual passion, and the betrothal, arose to her vivid fancy, and the maiden dashed her father's marriage present, the gaudy bracelet, to the floor, and covering her face with her fair white hands, she sought relief from the pressure of thought in a flood of tears. Her attention was attracted by the sound of a footstep, and a low voice whispered her name. She looked up and beheld her father. His frame was thin and attenuated with disease, his shoulders bent forward with premature extreme old age, and the slight masses of grey hair, which fell from under his invalid's cap, strayed along each sunken cheek, affording a fearful relief to the pale hue of that face, with the features, distorted by pain, the glassy eye, the shrunken lip and contracted brow. “Daughter, you are in tears,” said Mr. Waltham, laying a thin and withered hand upon Marian's shoulder. “It were better not to weep thus bitterly. What must be, must. I have planned this marriage, Marian, with an eye single to thy happiness—” he paused, for a violent fit of coughing choked his utterance. “When I am no more, Marian, you will need a protector. Lieutenant Wellwood Tracy—” Marian turned her head away, and concealed her face in her hands, at the name. “Nay, Marian, wherefore start you thus? Is not the Lieutenant nobly born, and gallantly bred? Has he not wealth; is not his name enrolled among the honored and respected of the world?” “Father! My troth is plighted to another?” exclaimed Marian in that decided voice which betokens the firmness of despair—“My troth is plighted to another!” “An outcast and a beggar!” exclaimed a strange voice, and the tall form of Major Tracy stood between the father and daughter—“An outcast and a beggar!” he continued, as a smile of mingled contempt and scorn curved his lips. “Thy troth is pledged to another forsooth? Why, Marian, I had thought better of thee than this? What! would you stoop to marry an outcast from his home, a rebel from his king, a man who has drawn his sword in most foul disloyalty, and by the unsheathing of that sword, blasphemed his God? Would you marry a beggar, fair maiden?” As he said this Major Tracy's brow became contracted with a dark frown, and then his lip trembled momently with an expression of contempt. His appearance was full of majesty, with his tall form and erect bearing; and his high pallid brow, seared by the wrinkles of worldly care and ambitious thought, was shown in bold relief, as the last glow of sunset fell on its bold outline, with the dark hair, sprinkled with the frost of age, thrown back in careless disorder. But the fair maiden quailed not before his glance. Stung by his taunts into a reply, she raised her fair form to its full stature, and with her blue eye, flashing with a steady, unvarying glance, and with her fair arm outstretched, she exclaimed in a quiet tone— “Can a father speak thus of his son?” she exclaimed, “can a father so far forget all feelings of natural affection, as to curse, with bitter words and sneering manner, the child, whom he is bound, by every law of God and man, to love and protect? Not thus does a maiden speak of her betrothed husband! No! Though Herbert were a beggar, clad in rags and banned by the unjust opinion of the world, though he labored under the bitterest curse that ever rose to the lips of an unjust, a passionate parent, still would I wed him, banned and cursed, though he were, aye, cheerfully and joyfully would I wed him, and as Truth lives in heaven, I will wed none—” “Hold, Marian, hold, for my sake!” shrieked her father, raising his attenuated hands, with a voice that seemed prophetic of his anticipated home—the grave—“Marian, pause for your father's sake!” The words died on the maiden's lip, the flush of momentary excitement passed from her beaming features, her eye lost its flashing glance, her form its erect stature, her arm fell listlessly by her side, and Marian forgot the vow of eternal constancy to her lover, when she beheld, standing before her, the weak and attenuated form of her father, trembling on the verge of the grave, with his eyes, dimmed by disease, warmed into the momentary glance that appealed with such silent eloquence to the holiest feelings of a daughter's heart. She sank weeping at his feet, and clasped his withered hands, as she wept. “You will consent, my daughter?” he whispered, “You will gratify your poor, fond father.” Marian murmured assent, and Major Tracy stood regarding the father and daughter with a glance of bitter mocking triumph as he muttered, “Now this brave son of mine shall know the man he has defied! Wellwood shall have the bride and the lands, and when the rebel has met his deserts, Wellwood succeeds to the Earldom! Miss Waltham,” he continued aloud, “I had well nigh forgot the object of my errand hither. Lieutenant Wellwood Tracy has just arrived, and with as little delay as may be, after the fatigue of travel, will hasten to pay his respects to his fair bride!” CHAPTER THE FIFTH. THE BRIDEGROOM. A STATELY array of silver candelabra, placed on the mantel, and containing tall formal wax candles, threw a glaring light around the antiquated parlor, with its massive mirrors, its Turkish carpeting, its wainscoted walls, adorned with paintings, its old fashioned sofa, and high backed mahogany chairs. A young man of some twenty-three years, attired in the uniform of an officer in the British dragoons, lay extended on the sofa in an attitude of the most elegant disorder; with his legs enveloped in Hessian boots, shining with spurs and spattered with mud, very easily crossed one over the other; his head with its powdered locks resting upon one arm, while with his face to the ceiling he seemed intently engaged in examining the merits of his chapeau, with its mass of feathers, which his other hand held poised directly over his face. He was not an unhandsome man, but there was an air of effeminacy about his small, delicate features, and the jaunty air of every position assumed by his slender and well proportioned figure, that gave you an idea you stood in the presence of the fashionable fop, the man of the world of idlers, the “dawdler” at ladies' elbows, the talker of small sayings, the coiner of compliments, and smatterer of little pieces of all kinds of knowledge, which combined together form what the mass calls a gentleman, always provided the combination of so many rare qualities is well dressed. And Wellwood Tracy was no dull fellow either. A few summers at Oxford had given him some idea of the existence of Greek and Latin, and he was sufficiently acquainted with them to know that these words meant languages, not celebrated philosophers; a winter in London, passed amid the excitement of balls, routes, soirees, and the thousand other assemblages of the gay world, had given him some idea of life, and instilled into his mind that fashionable code of morals, which places the winning of a game at cards, and the destruction of a woman's virtue, on a scale of perfect equality in the list of innocent pleasures and venial sins; what with all these acquirements, and a genteel way of saying large oaths and dainty imprecations, Lieutenant Wellwood Tracy was voted by the world in general, and his messmates in particular, to be a deuced clever fellow, a finished gentleman, in every way worthy of succeeding to the Earldom of Wallingford, in case the intermediate heirs should happen to vacate this scene of trial and care. The Lieutenant had just counted each feather in 3 his chapeau for the twelfth time, when the door opened, and a servant informed him that his chamber was ready for his use, where he might remove from his person the dust, disorder and dishabille of travel. “Now for my bridal robes”—lisped the gallant dragoon, as he tumbled from the sofa into an erect position. “I wonder where that cursed valet of mine is staying all the time? What detains the village priest? Well—well (looking at his watch) it's near the hour, and I've just time to dress. A fellow can be married but once—it's best to submit with a good grace, so here goes for the mysteries of the toilet—and then she's handsome and rich, and I may one day be Earl of Wallingford!” Disappointment is the great misery of life—success the great blessing. Which of the twain shal be the lot of the gallant Lieutenant Wellwood Tracy of His Majesty's dragoons? CHAPTER THE SIXTH. THE VALLEY OF THE WISSAHIKON. When Harry Heft left the farm-house of the Quaker, in obedience to the invisible signal, the new moon, with its delicate crescent of silver, poised in the clear azure of the western horizon, was shedding around over the woods and stream of the Wissahikon, a shower of softened light, which danced on the prominent points of the foliage, sparkled along the rivulet, and waved in threads of radiance through the open glades and shadowed recesses of the forest. Having passed through the small garden, around the farm-house, the young soldier brushed aside the grass of the meadow heavy with dew, and pursued his way toward the Wissahikon, which rolled along the vale, with the soft musical murmur of water, sweeping along a pebbled bottom, and gave its thousand tiny ripples, and delicate wavelets to the brightening kiss of the moonbeams. “Well, may I die the death of a spy”—exclaimed Harry as he reached the banks of the stream, and gazed around—“May I die the death of a riglar built renegate, if this aint purty. I never did see my native stream look so nice afore—and now that I think of it, I'd like to visit my old folks; but I haint got time. I must git that purty gal out of the clutches o' them Britishers at Major Tracy's, and then I kin sit down and play if I like, but not afore. But where in the name of the Continental Congress is that feller Dennis? Dennis O'Dougherty, McDermott, McDonough, McDaniel, Mac —” “Mac Divil!” answered a voice from a clump of elder bushes, within arm's-reach of Heft. “And is it callin' a man, dacent and civil, out o' his name, at this solemn hour of the night, ye are, ye spalpayn? Is this yer pe'liteness, Harry Heft”—continued the voice, as the bushes rustled, and a small round face, with a very small, and very bright pair of gray eyes, long upper lip and short nose, emerged from the foliage. Is this yer pe'liteness I say? I'm ashamed of ye, Harry Heft.” The face gradually rose from among the bushes, and presently a tall, stout figure, clad in the uniform of the Black Rangers, leaped out on the turf, and in an instant was at the side of Harry Heft. “I'm ashamed of ye, Harry Heft”—said the Irishman, with a grave look, and with a merry sparkle in his eye. “By the ghost of Fin-ma-coul, of St. Patrick, St. Pater, and a half dozen more of the rispictible old jontlemen, who raised petaties in ould Erin afore the curse of Cromwell and King George was put upon her sod, I'm ashamed of ye, Harry Heft—there now ye pesky critter,” he continued, for long residence among the people of the northern Provinces had spiced the brogue of Dennis McDermott, with a little dash of the Yankee dialect. “There now ye pesky critter ye, are ye satisfied?” Harry burst into a peal of laughter, and exclaimed between the bursts of merriment— “Look here, Irish, somebody must a-been drying your primin' before a hickory fire—you go off at sich very short notice. Why you explode at about the eighth fraction of half-cock. Why, Irish, you're gitting quite animated—if you'd only take a'ter me something might be made out of you. You are a reg'lar old boy!” “Jest call me by me christen name, Dennis, will ye? Or pr'aps ye'd like yer picter spilt?” “No, thank'ee, not jist now,” replied Harry, catching the quiet twinkle of the warm-hearted Irishman's eye. “But come along, Dennis. Let's ford the creek and pass on; we've got about a mile to go, and the sooner we're movin' the better.” The Rangers waded the stream, which was not more than breast high, at this point, and taking a beaten track on the western side, proceeded southward at as rapid a pace as might be. After about five minutes walking under the shade of the wood, the path emerged into an open field, covered with blackberry bushes, brambles, and wild vines, trailing along the ground, with heaps of newly cut timber, scattered along the surface of the uncultivated earth. The field was passed and the Rangers arrived at a spot of singular beauty. The Wissahikon entered a deep ravine or glen, if either of these names are appropriate, where the banks arose by an ascent in some places gradual, in other points abrupt, into high and massive hills, clothed from the sparkle of the ripple, to the deep blue of the sky, with most luxuriant trees, with foliage faintly dyed by autumn, of every gradation of fantastic outline of form, every variety of light and shade. Here swelling into pyramids of leaves, silvered by the moonbeams; there sloping away into shady nooks: at one point sweeping down to one brooklet by a gentle descent of chestnut trees, in all the towering height of a century's growth, succeeded by tender saplings, whose leaves were interwoven with those of many a green shrub and verdant bush growing by the water side, and dashing their verdure in the waves of the deep, clear, mirror-like flood; at another point, circuling around some perpendicular mass of rock, whose clefts were green with many a wild vine, the foliage sank suddenly down, with a leaf here and there touched by the moonlight, while all the rest was dark and indistinct. The stream, winding through the glen, with its deep and rippleless waters of glassy clearness, reflected the ascending steeps on either side, and the small space of the clear blue sky which these heights, viewed from the vale below, permitted to be seen, with so faithful an outline, and such a delicate mass of hues and tints, lights and shades, that it seemed as though the landscape beneath the waters was an ideal and spiritual copy of the real and living landscape above. The path which our Rangers pursued, led along the water's edge, and wound among the colossal trunks of wide-branching oaks, whose roots had been striking deep, and whose limbs had been growing stronger for hundreds of years. As they wended along with the silver murmur of the stream filling the air, and the soft moonlight floating amid the waving foliage, the Rangers for a time, under the influence of the holy silence of the hour, ceased all conversation, and with their footfalls echoing along the wood, and the occasional rustling of leaves as they brushed through a mass of shrubbery opposing their path, they pursued their way, until the murmuring of a waterfall told them of their vicinity to Rittenhouse's mill, a massive stone building, which rose in strong relief with its grey walls, standing boldly out against the background of verdure, while a number of cottages barns and outhouses were scattered around it on the eastern side of the artificial cascade. The Rangers paused for a moment upon a shelving rock, and looked back into the lovely glen, which they were about to leave. “Och, comrid, Harry Heft,” said the Irishman, breaking the silence which had lasted for a quarter of an hour. “Sure this beautiful spot, with its feathery trees, and soft moonlight, and its quietness and sulemnity, brings to mind the place ov me birth, wid the little hut, and its green turf on the bank of the Lake Killarney! The curse o' God be on the tyrant who driv me frum me home! Is it blubberin' ye are, Harry Heft?” The young American Ranger certainly showed no signs of weeping, but Dennis merely meant the insinuation as an excuse for the tear which stole from his own eyelid, and washed his scarred and sunburnt cheek. “What did the British drive you from your home for?” exclaimed Harry, participating in the Irishman's outburst of long-hidden sympathies. “Ye've seen a tear in my eye, Harry Heft, and you may as well make a note ov it; for none 'ill you iver see there agin. The why and wharefore I left me native country is a long story, Harry Heft; but ye must know Harry, that meself and me mother, and the wife and the childer, (not forgetting the pig, be jabers,) lived in the nate little shealing on the banks of the Killarney, and not a care did we know, mair be token we had plenty of petaties, until the red coated Britishers came and meddled wid a little still of me own—” “Still? Whiskey still?” inquired Henry. “The same. A little bit ov a hand machine to manyfactur' the poteen, ye know. The sodjers came, and we hade a taste ov a ruction, and I giv one of the rascals the `unlucky blow,' not maneing it at all, at all; but flattened out he was, and it was I that did it.” “You sarved him right! Confound the Britishers, I say!” “Amen to that. And then they gave me the choice of the gallows or the dragoon's saddle, for they saw I was a stout, tall felley (fellow) of me inches, and I chosed the gallows. But the wife clung to my bosom, and the childer clung to me knees, and pursuaded wid their tears that sed so much more than words, to 'list, sooner than be hanged, and 'list I did, sorrow to me soul! And I've never seen wife or childer since.” The Irishman brushed a tear from his eye, and Harry was seized with a sudden fit of whistling. “Aye! Whistle, Harry, whistle! It's better to whistle nor to weep, and if I didn't laugh sometimes my heart 'ud break for the grief that's tugging at it. Ochone, Erin Mavourneen—I'm making a judy of meself.” “How long is it since ye listed, Dennis!” “Ten years or thereabouts. We came to Montreal, and seen some service among the French and Injins, and on one occashun, a party of us dragoons were dispatched all the way to Detroit, and the 3* whole kit ov us, barrin' two others besides meself, were riddled by the red skinned Injins. We three survivors picked up our bones and walked off about our business, each on his own pertikler way, for we didn't see any necessity of our returning to Montreal and the barracks, or pushing on to Detroit with its wild cats and Injins.” “And then you pushed eastward and settled down about Germantown here?” “And here I've lived and wrought for near five years, until Captain Tracy, and a likely boy he is too, tipped me the wink, and then I followed him to the wars, and maybe I haven't been a bad thorn in the side of the Britishers?” “A regular splinter in their sore-foot, as one might say. But should any of your former comrades see you agin, think they'd know you?” “It's difficult for meself to tell. But 'sposin' they did see me and knew me, and had me in their clutches at the same identical time; it's my candid opinion they'd give me a pine coffin, and a dozen bullets. The more shame to 'em and their king, and the whole posse of 'em, by the blessed St. Pathrick.” “Well, now look here `Irish'—I call you that 'cause it sounds more sociable than Dennis—I owe you a life for a savin' mine at the rumpus of Brandywine. And now by the Lord above us, if the Britishers ever catch hold of you, and I don't rescue you, or if they harm you, and I don't avenge you, then may I never know what it is to die a soldier's death, but die the pitiful death of a spy! That's swor' to, Irish—” continued the good-hearted soldier as he grasped the Irishman's hand and gave it a hearty shake. “And now let's be off; You know our Captain told us to pay a visit to his father's house, and recon'itre, and then bring him word, but I've a notion of puttin' an end to this marriage somehow or other, and bringin' him word of that too, before he heard it was in progress.” “Sure, Harry Heft, ye didn't tell me of any marriage. Be jabers I'm all in the dark—” “But come along. Let's ford the creek at the falls, here, and travel down toward the Paper Mill, and I'll tell you on the way!” Fording the stream, they passed along a road on the eastern side of the Wissahikon for about a quarter of a mile, until the waters of the Paper Mill Run came plunging into its bosom, from a height covered with the buildings and out-houses pertaining to a large mill. Pursuing the course of the rivulet, which at this point takes a sudden bend to the west on its way to the Schuylkill, after fifteen minutes had elapsed, they arrived at a spot, where a perpendicular wall of rocks arises from the opposite and northern shore of the stream, clothed in every cleft and spacious crevice with giant pines, some growing out from the rock in a horizontal direction, others slanting upward, others bending crosswise, and with every giant pine, however fantastical in form, flinging its branches out into the moonlight, from the straight and steep ascent of the cliff. “Do you see that barricade of rocks, Irish?” “Be jabers, a nateral fortriss!” “Upon the top of that mass of rock, is concealed as pretty a mansion as ever your eye rested upon. That's Major Tracy's house, and we ascend to it by a winding road. We cross over the stream on these steppin' stones. The entrance to this road is concealed among the bushes yonder. It begins somewhere below this tremendous wall. I have it.” They entered the bushes, and presently were journeying along a road, worn by horses' feet, that wound round the precipice, affording an easy, though somewhat sudden ascent to the platform of earth at the summit. Presently they emerged from under the shade of the pine trees, and stood upon the turf of a green lawn, fenced round the edge of the precipice with the interlacing trunks of the pines, forming a natural protection, against the dangers of the steep, with their branches entwined through each other, crossed and re-crossed, and woven together, so thickly and densely, as to give an observer the idea, that what he beheld was the work of man's art, rather than a feat of nature. CHAPTER THE SEVENTH. THE BRIDAL PARTY. In the centre of the lawn arose the substantial stone mansion of Major Tracy, a building of some magnitude, overshadowed by a towering sycamore that grew in the garden behind the house, and rising in all the strength and grandeur of ages, threw its leaning trunk over the gabled roof, while its far reaching branches, bursting out on every side, clad with a thick and luxuriant foliage, afforded a pleasant and agreeable defence from the rigor of the sun in the heat of summer, and now, as the moon sank below the horizon, enveloped the edifice and the lawn in its vicinity in deepest shadows. The darkness was broken by long lines of light streaming from the half-closed shutters of the chamber looking out upon the portico which fronted the verdant grass, and extended along the entire front of the mansion. “Now keep your eyes about you, Irish,” exclaimed Harry, as he glanced hurriedly round at the spacious mansion and the range of out-buildings. “By the Continental Congress, if I aint very much mistaken, them lights, flashing from the windows, out upon the porch, have a tale of their own to tell. Let's reccini'tre, Irish.” “Be St. Pathrick! what's that?” muttered Dennis in a tone of suppressed wonder, as they approached the porch. “Do ye see anything there, my darlint crittur?” Harry Heft followed the finger of the Irishman with his eye, and discovered, fastened by their bridle reins to a pillar of the portico, two gallant steeds, whose trappings, the ornamented saddle cloth and the holsters, all showed that their riders were at least military men, if not officers of rank and authority. With hushed breath and cautious step, Harry Heft stole along the floor of the portico toward the window shutters from whence emerged the light, and which reached from the roof of the portico to the floor. Each window served the purposes of a door, as well as a medium for the admittance of daylight. Gazing through the crevice of the shutters—the sashes opened after the fashion of folding doors, being thrown back—Harry Heft beheld a scene which he regarded with evident wonder and astonishment, although he had anticipated something of the kind. The apartment within was spacious, large, and furnished after the fashion of some sixty years since. It was lighted by a chandelier, filled with stately candles of wax, and suspended from the stuccoed ceiling. In the centre of the apartment with his back turned to the window, stood a portly man, with a very red, round face, a very brilliant nose, and a very small mouth, and his ample figure arrayed in the gown and surplice of a clergyman, while his little fat hands, with short gouty fingers, grasped a gilt edged book, from which he was reading. It was the book of Common Prayer, and he read the marriage ceremony. In front of him were the bridegroom and bride; on one side stood Major Tracy, with a settled frown on his brow: a spacious arm-chair on the opposite side contained the form of the invalid Squire Waltham, who gazed with a half vacant, half imbecile stare upon the company around. At his elbow stood a gentleman of some fifty winters, attired in the undress of a colonel in the British army, and with an impressive countenance, marked by the lines of care and thought. He was named Colonel Musgrave, and he held the baton of command over the fortieth regiment. The arrival of this gentleman had been somewhat late and hurried, for his boots were bespattered with mud, and his entire costume was marked by the unfinished and disarranged air that attends a journey undertaken and executed in haste. Opposite to this gentleman, and forming the right wing of the circle, was a young gentleman, attired as a cornet in the dragoon service of his Majesty's —th regiment, and with a face and air expressive of nothing in especial, except a very apparent desire to play as critical a part in his capacity of right wing of the picture, as his disordered dress and soiled boots would possibly admit. The bridegroom, arrayed in a lustrous coat of snow white silk, with small clothes and stockings to match, buckles of shining silver, and square toed shoes, seemed disposed to do particular justice to his situation as a prominent point of the picture. Halting on his left leg, with the right advanced, he extended one delicate white hand, sparkling with rings, to the bride, displaying all the beauty and finish of the ruffle at his wrist in the action, while his other hand was disposed very gracefully, with the little finger deposited in a fold of his snow white and gaudily embroidered vest, as with his head erect, and his powdered hair flowing in graceful folds over his shoulder, Lieutenant Wellwood Tracy looked straight forward over the head of the clerical gentleman, and a complacent expression mantled over his face, which seemed to intimate that he considered himself a very fine point of the picture indeed, and worthy of the pencil of a Vandyke, or a Godfrey Kneller. The whole scene was a mockery of a solemn sacrifice, but the victim destined to be offered up at the altar, appeared in all the splendor of her queenly beauty even at that dread hour, when the utterance of a few simple words, and the transposition of a ring, would place her destiny in the hands of one, for whom she cared little, and of whom she knew less, and sever her fate from the silken cord that entwined it with the destiny of him, whom she loved with all the purity and self devotion of a maiden passion. The golden hair, unconfined by band or cincture, fell in a shower of waving tresses over her robes of white, down to her very waist; while with head drooped low, and eyes downcast, the maiden, scarce knowing what she did, tendered her hand— cold as the marble of a statue—to her gallant bridegroom, and muttered the responses of the ceremony with a vacant manner and absent air, as though her mind wandered amid the shadowy creations of a dream. Harry Heft beheld the scene at a glance, and as he gazed, he became instinctly aware of the relative positions of the parties. He had scarce time to think of some means of delivering the fair maiden, when the marriage ceremony reached the point, near its accomplishment, where the least binding words are said, and the ring is placed upon the finger of the bride. At this moment Harry felt some one pressing against his shoulder, and a face touching his own, while his quick ear caught the sound of suppressed breathing. He turned his head aside, whispering—“Hist! Dennis!” when a hand, placed over his mouth, hushed the exclamation of sudden surprise that was bursting from his lips, and he beheld the face of Herbert Tracy gazing over his shoulder with his lip compressed and his eye flashing, as he regarded the marriage scene within the apartment. Every lineament of his countenance was impressed with an expression so strange, so dread, so unreal and fearful in its character, that the Ranger scarce might recognize the face of his Leader in that high forehead all seamed by deep wrinkles, and relieved by the hair, thrown wildly aside from the countenance; the full, black eye, glaring from beneath the eyebrows; the lips compressed as fixedly and firmly as those of a chiselled statue; and the lines of each cheek so clearly marked with the settled appearance that betokens powerful yet suppressed emotion, and the entire visage, with every outline, shown in the boldest relief, by the glaring light which streamed from the chandelier within the apartment, seemed so much changed and altered, that Harry Heft only knew his captain from the simple reason, that it were impossible to forget one lineament of the face and features that he had known and looked upon from earliest childhood. Harry felt his hand grasped by that of his leader, with a quick, hurried, but expressive movement— “As God lives, stand by me!” whispered the captain. “As God lives, I will, to the death!” returned the soldier in as deep a whisper. “With this ring thee I wed”—exclaimed the bridegroom within the apartment, as, bending aside with a most graceful bow, he took the fair hand of Marian in his own, and with a delicate movement of the thumb and forefinger of his right hand, proceeded to place the marriage ring on the ivory finger of the maiden. The gold had touched the finger of Marian, and every eye was fixed upon the twain; Major Tracy smiled grimly as he viewed the accomplishments of his scheme; the invalid father looked up into the face of his daughter; the eyes of the clerical gentleman wandered from his book; and even the face of the colonel, as well as the cornet, betrayed some interest in the matter; the ring, I say, had touched, but not encircled the finger, when a rushing sound was heard, a hurried footstep, and the tall form of Herbert Tracy stood between the bridegroom and bride, the ring was dashed on the floor, and Wellwood Tracy was hurled aside by a blow from the scabbard of the captain's sword. “She is mine! Mine before God and Heaven!” exclaimed Herbert, as Marian fell in his arms, with a shriek and a glance of wild rapture, that told of recognition. “Mine before God and Heaven! This for the man that shall say me nay!” Unsheathing his sword with his good right hand, he gathered the fainting maiden to his bosom with his other hand, and glanced around upon the bridal party, like a noble stag at bay, as he retired one step toward the window. Had some sudden and fearful spell fallen upon the stern Major Tracy, the invalid Waltham, the round faced parson, the sedate colonel, the smooth faced cornet, or the silken bridegroom, they could not, each and all of them, have formed more finished and perfect statues of surprise than they did for a single instant after Herbert had burst into the room. Had a column of fire shot upwards from the floor; had a thunder bolt severed the ceiling, and scattered its rays of death at their feet; had the mansion been rocked by the heavings of an earthquake, the bridal party, it is very probable, would have been somewhat surprised, if not thunderstricken; but here was column of fire, thunder bolt, and earthquake all combined in one form, and that form the figure of the gallant Ranger. I trow the bridal party were more than surprised. Herbert Tracy took advantage of this first instant of speechless astonishment, and pressing his betrothed closer to his bosom, strode with a hurried, yet even step toward the window—“Mine she is before God and Heaven!” he cried—“mine by all that is good and hallowed! Mine by her plighted troth—mine by her vows of love!” he continued, reaching the window, and extending his sword, while, with a bitter sneer on his lip, he glanced around the room—“And think ye I will surrender my claim to any man that lives? Curses may be heaped upon my head by him, whom I am bound to name my father, and death and ruin may stand in my path, but still—by the Lord that lives— Herbert Tracy will not show himself unworthy of his name! A merry even to you, gentlefolks!” Emerging from the window, he rushed across the porch, and stood beside the steeds that had so lately borne the colonel and the cornet to the bridal party, but which were now held ready for mounting, by Dennis at one bridle rein, and Harry at the other. “Mount, capt'in, mount”—cried Harry—“They 're comin'—they're comin'! Mount, and away down the Paper Mill Run road! Push for the Quaker's farm house! Mount, by the Continental Congress, mount!” Ere Harry had finished his favorite expletive, Herbert had sprang upon the stoutest of the steeds, and with the fainting Marian in his arms, struck for the road that led around the rock down to the Wissahikon. “Now's your time, Dennis? If you've any sperrit in your lazy bones, mount that horse by the stable yonder—I'll mount this! Hurray, boy, for your neck's in danger! Now then—” cried the gallant trooper as he sprang upon the cornet's horse, and enveloped his form in the blanket that hung at the saddle bow—“now then, `Irish,' strike for Rittenhouse's Mill, right across the fields— they'll mistake the fluttering of this blanket for the young lady's dress. Take the fields for it, and lead 'em on a wrong scent. By the Continental Congress—” “Yes, be jabers!” shouted Dennis. “Will it plase your leddyshep to rid the laste bit closer to me! Och, darlin'! Whoop!” And off they went, like mad devils as they were, the sound of their horses' hoofs echoing far around, and the white blanket of Harry Heft fluttering in the moonlight, like the robe of an uneasy spirit, amusing itself with a midnight ride. The sounds of the horses' hoofs roused the astonished bridal party from the spell of surprise, and with one assent, they rushed out on the portico, leaving the invalid in her arm-chair. “Call the servants”—shouted the Colonel— “Wilson, I say—where's that lazy trooper!” “There he goes!” muttered the enraged Lieutenant Tracy with an oath, as he ran from one end of the porch to the other; “there he goes down the Wissahikon—by the G—s!” “I ra-yther think they've taken a cut across the fe-eld, Lev'tenant,” lisped the cornet, smiling at the idea of telling the whole story at the mess table. “There they go! How her dwess does fluttaw,” he continued, as the white blanket met his eye. Without a word, without an exclamation of surprise, did Major Tracy assemble the domestics, and rouse the trooper, who was sleeping on a wheelbarrow near the stable door, under the influence of plentiful potations. A short and hurried council was held; men were despached to the stables at a hundred yards distance, to saddle other horses; some started on foot in pursuit of the fugitives; but amid all their conversation, their imprecations, and their vows of vengeance, the ears of the bridal party were saluted with the sound of the retreating hoofs, echoing from the grounds north of the mansion, to the road on the east, and from the road, through the woods to the grounds again. Full ten minutes elapsed ere horses could be saddled for the major, the colonel, the cornet, and the lieutenant; and the oaths and imprecations of the three latter did not by any means tend to increase the speed of the domestics in their employment. “Scour the country in every direction!” shouted the colonel, as he beheld his companions mounted, together with the half sober trooper and three of the domestics. “The fugitives cannot pass the British lines without alarming the picquets! This side of the lines they're in our power! Cornet, you will join me, with that drunken lout yonder, in pursuing the rebel captain across the field. Major, perhaps it would be best for you and the lieutenant to take the Wissahikon road. We can traverse the country in different directions, and meet at Rittenhouse's mill.” Major Tracy nodded assent. “Look ye, sirs,” he exclaimed to the three stout fellows, who, with pistols in their hands, were mounted on strong fleet horses by his side. “Look 'ye, sirs—should ye come across the fugitives, be careful that you do not harm the lady in white, Miss Waltham. You are all good marksmen—I'll make the man of you comfortable for life who shall pick the rebel officer in black from his horse! Mark 'ye—he is a traitor, and deserves no quarter! Away!” And as they galloped away in various directions, one of the frightened female domestics, a weak and aged woman, entered the scene of the late bridal ceremony, and beheld the clerical gentleman, on his knees, before Mr. Waltham, who was still seated in his armed-chair, with his head fallen to one side, his eyes closed, and his lips parted. The clergyman was engaged in chafing the hands of the invalid, and the servant drew nearer, and looked over his shoulder into the face of the sick man, and started back with a cry of horror, as she discovered the ghastly paleness of his cheeks, the blue livid circles around his eyes, and the sunken eye-sockets. His spirit had gone from the scenes of marrying and giving in marriage, from the scenes of man's passions, and man's wrong to his fellow, from his daughter, his lands and his gold, up to that Tribunal that knows no earthly passion or prejudice, there—in the solemn words of the Sacred Book— “To give account of the deeds done in the body.” 4 CHAPTER THE EIGHTH. THE PURSUIT. When Herbert Tracy flung himself upon the steed of the British Colonel, and planting his spurs into the sides of the plunging animal, forced him to take the steep and winding road that led around the precipice, a thousand feelings rushed through his mind, and a wild tumult of opposing thoughts agitated his brain, but amid all the contending feelings and opposing thoughts, one idea was uppermost in his mind, a steady, firm and unalterable resolve to bear his betrothed away to some scene of safety, and a desperate purpose to part with his life, ere the beautiful being, whose head now lay pillowed on his breast, should be torn from his embrace, by the rude hands of those who had, so mockingly, toyed with her plighted vows. Winding his arm yet closer around the waist of Marian, he dashed down the narrow path, plunged into the Wissahikon, and ascending the opposite bank, gained the rocky road, which pursued its irregular course along the banks of the stream. As he flew along the road with the speed of wind, the fresh and breezy night air, fanning the pallid cheek of the maiden, awoke her to consciousness, and Herbert felt the warm beating of her heart, throbbing against the hand which held her to his side. She opened her beaming blue eyes, and as the warm flush of youth and love again glowed on her swelling cheek, she cast a hurried glance around, as though she essayed to recall her wandering thoughts, and then while the whole truth flashed upon her, she wound her arms with a quick, convulsive movement, around the neck of her lover, her bosom rose and fell in the moonlight, and sinking her head upon his manly breast, she found relief from the tumult of opposing thoughts, in a flood of tears. Herbert gazed upon her fair face with its beauty half upturned to the sky, and if ever, during his wild and dreamy life, he felt his soul swell with the feeling of intense happiness, and every nerve thrill with delight, it was at that moment, when her full and lustrous orbs were cast upward, with a glance so full of high and hallowed love, so full of all the trustfulness of woman's passion, and beaming with that winning confidence, unmodified by mistrust or doubt, which the vilest of mankind would hesitate to wrong or betray. The sounds of pursuit broke upon the air. Herbert had attained the point, where the Paper Mills cast a lengthened shadow over the stream, and a quarter of a mile lay before him ere he could reach Rittenhouse's Mill. It was his purpose to avoid his pursuers, to seek the farm house of the Quaker, Joab Smiley, place his betrothed in safety till the morrow, then repass the British lines by the bed of the Wissahikon, and reach the Haunted House by midnight. Marian—thought Herbert— might remain concealed in the farm house, with entire safety, until the coming day, when the fate of battle would enable him to place her in a situation of greater security. The sounds of pursuit, the echoing of the horses' hoofs and the shouts of the pursuers broke louder and nearer upon the stillness of night, and sinking the rowels into the flanks of his steed, Herbert gave him free rein, and in an instant the noble barb dashed along the road, with the monotonous beat of the hoof upon the sod, betokening the utmost stretch of his speed put to the test. A hundred yards lay between Herbert and Rittenhouse's Mill, and a hundred yards behind his pursuers came thundering along the road. The report of a pistol broke upon the air, and a bullet whistled by Herbert's ear, at the same moment that the voice of his father, urging the pursuit, rose high above all other sounds. “On—on—let him not escape with life! Let your aim be sure, and the bullet certain of its mark! Onward, my brave men, onward! “I will foil them yet!” Herbert muttered between his teeth, as he recognized the tones of his father's voice. “Here is Rittenhouse's Mill—the moon has gone down, and the night is dark,—now God help me!” As the exclamation rose upon his lips, the sound of horses' hoofs which rose in his rear, were echoed by similar sounds on the opposite bank of the stream, and the crashing of brushwood and the rustling of branches, gave Herbert warning, that his escape was cut off beyond the Mill. The crisis came. The Mill was reached, the party on the opposite side came thundering through the woods, and the voice of Major Tracy was heard, nearer and yet more near; when, reining his steed up against a small and perpendicular rock which peeped out from among a mass of brushwood, Herbert loosened his feet from the stirrups, and gathering his arm around the waist of Marian, with a firmer embrace, sprang from the horse, on to the rock, amid the shelter of the environing shrubbery, and as he sprang, the affrighted horse bounded forward, dashed through the stream, swept up the road that traversed the opposite hill, and with the speed of a bolt, driven from the bow, disappeared in the shade of the wood. As he disappeared, the party of Col. Musgrave emerged from the woods on the opposite bank into the stream. Almost at the very same instant Major Tracy with his men; rushed along with the speed of lightning, within an arm's reach of the spot upon which Herbert stood, and passing between the rock and the Mill, dashed into the Wissahikon, and ere he was aware he confronted the colonel and his company in mid-stream. “Which way went the fugitives?” shouted Col. Musgrave. “Do you not hear the horses' hoofs upon the hill?” replied the stern and commanding voice of Major Tracy—“away! away! We trifle—we lose time! away! “We'll have them now, by —” exclaimed the voice of Lieutenant Wellwood. “They cannot be more than fifty yards ahead! Now for't my men!” And with one assent the pursuers joined their forces, and galloping up the opposite bank of the stream in the direction taken by the steed which Herbert had just abandoned, their forms were lost in the shades of the forest, and the echoing of their horses' hoofs, began to grow fainter on the air. Herbert had well calculated his address and dexterity, combined with an intimate acquaintance with the spot, when he took the sudden leap from the saddle on to the rock, among the surrounding brushwood. In his youthful ramblings near the Mill, he had discovered a path, perhaps worn by the feet of Indians, an age before, winding along the nooks, the heights and recesses of the hills forming the eastern bank of the stream. The entrance to this path, within a few feet of the Mill, was hidden by the branches of the trees mingling with the light shrubbery, that grew upon the perpendicular rocks, separating the road from the forest. In the moment of peril, the memory of the rock and the secret path flashed upon his mind, and in an instant, he availed himself of the remembrance, and eluded pursuit in the very crisis of the chase. As the sounds of the pursuing party came softened and almost hushed by distance to the ears of the lovers, Herbert gave Marian the support of his arm, and they threaded their way along the winding path through the woods, until they emerged upon the meadow sloping from farmer Smiley's house, down to the Wissahikon. Approaching the farm house, they found they had been preceded by Harry Heft and his friend Dennis, who it seems had succeeded in persuading the Quaker to receive the betrothed of Herbert, under the shelter of his roof, for a few days until the fortune of war might enable the lovers to unite their fates beyond danger of separation. After he had seen Marian safe under the peaceful roof, and attended by the care of the young Quakeress, Herbert departed from the farm house, with a promise to return at the earliest moment that might afford an opportunity. Dennis and Harry proceeded to take their way to the Wissahikon on their return to the American lines, in another direction from that taken by Herbert, who paused an instant on the banks of the stream, ere he plunged into the recesses of the woods, and as he looked back upon the quiet home of the Quaker farmer sleeping in the starlight, a fearful presentiment crossed his mind, that he should never gaze upon his betrothed again—that some dire and hidden calamity was hovering over their path—that some dread and overwhelming evil, was even now gathering blackness upon the horizon of their sky, and would suddenly burst over their heads, and crush every fair prospect of their life, every bright hope of their existence under its blightning influences. “Come what will”—said Herbert, in a voice that was uttered not to the air, but to his own heart, “come what will, my resolve is taken. My hand and sword shall be raised, first in defence of the hills and vales of this fair land of my birth; and then in defence of the maiden, bound to me by the solemn vows of our plighted troth. Death may come, and ruin may threaten—but their approaches shall be met with honor!” CHAPTER THE NINTH. THE COUNCIL. The hills and vales of the Wissahikon slept in the silence of midnight, when a solitary horseman issued from the mass of forest trees, near the Haunted House, and taking his way across an intervening field, presently reined in his steed along the front of the mansion. It was a small, one storied building, marked by a style of architecture which mingled the steep, gable-ended roof of a cottage, with the high and pointed windows of the Gothic order; while the eves of the mansion were heavy with carved work, the window frames were decorated with quaint devices in wood, the numerous chimneys by which it was surmounted seemed as much contrived for ornament as use, and the general air and appearance of the place, indicated that it might have been the abode of some wealthy admirer of the country, who had here fixed himself a home amid the solitude and shade of the woods. It was situated on a gentle eminence approached by steps of stone, built in the grassy bank, and the limited lawn which sloped from three sides of the picturesque edifice, was terminated by a pleasant grove of horse-chestnut trees, giving an air of seclusion to the spot, while the ground in the rear was occupied by a garden, once agreeably diversified with flowers, but now overgrown and choked by weeds. The edifice had, in fact, been the summer abode of a wealthy English merchant of Philadelphia, who was scared from its precincts by the noise and confusion of war. Deserted by its proprietor, the mansion had fallen into partial decay, and was alternately occupied by marauding parties of the American and British armies, who not unfrequently awoke the echoes of its quiet walls, with sounds of mirth and revelry, which, perchance, was the occasion of its name—the Haunted House—the songs and yells of the drunken troopers being mistaken by the surrounding farmers for the cries and shrieks of spirits of the unreal world. As the horseman halted in front of the Haunted House, a figure, attired in the uniform of the Black Rangers, advanced from the shade of the horse-chestnut trees, exclaiming— “Well, Capt'in, is that you? Dennis and Leftenant Heft has just come in—I was afeared something mought a-happened to you.” “Aye, Sergeant, I am back again without harm or injury. But tell me—has the commander-in-chief arrived? If my eyes do not deceive me, those dusky masses, scattered across the fields yonder, are the American troops, and the glimmer of their arms in the starlight shows that they are ready for action at a moment's warning.” “Gineral Washington has arrived”—replied the Sergeant—“and the Black Rangers are honored with the post of `Guard around the Haunted House.' But with regard to the information, gathered to-night by the Rangers—” Having been put in possession of this information, Herbert sprung from his horse, and was admitted by a sentinel into the front chamber of the mansion, where a glaring light, burning upon a large oaken table, discovered the figures of a number of officers, of various ranks and grades, attired in the blue and buff uniform of the Continental service. “It will be advisable to begin the attack before sunrise to-morrow morning”—exclaimed the officer who sat at the head of the table, as Captain Tracy entered. “This is the plan of battle agreed upon,” he continued, laying his hand upon an unrolled chart which was spread open upon the table—“the divisions of Generals Sullivan and Wayne, flanked by the brigade of General Conway, will enter the village of Germantown, and commence the attack, with the light infantry of the enemy who are posted at Allen's House, at some three miles distance from this place.—Ah! Captain Tracy, I am glad to welcome you back; how have you succeeded in your mission?” Herbert proceeded as briefly as possible to relate to the Commander-in-chief, the various facts in his possession relative to the force, numbers, and position of the enemy. “The British line of encampment crosses the village of Germantown at right angles,” said Herbert, “near the centre. The left wing extends from the main road, across the irregular and inclosed grounds of the various farmers, over the Wissahikon along to the river Schuylkill. It is covered in front, by mounted and dismounted chasseurs, and the right which extends eastward toward the Delaware, is defended in front by the Queen's American Rangers and a battalion of light infantry. The 40th regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Col. Musgrave, is posted nearly a mile in advance of the main line, between Chew's House and Chestnut Hill, and a battalion of light infantry, occupies the summit of the hill, three miles in advance of this spot.” “Your information, Captain Tracy,” said the Commander-in-chief, “agrees, in every essential point, with the data already in my possession. So, gentlemen, our original plan of battle holds good. While the divisions of Generals Wayne and Sullivan enter the village by way of Chestnut Hill, the divisions of Greene and Stephens, flanked by McDougall's brigade, will take a circuit along the Limekiln Road, some two miles eastward from Chew's House, and attack the enemy's right wing. The militia of Maryland and New Jersey, under command of Generals Smallwood and Forman, will march down the Old York Road, which lies three miles to the east of the Limekiln Road, and engage with the rear of the right. General Armstrong's Pennsylvania brigade will attack the enemy's left at Vanduring's Mill, at the junction of the Wissahikon with the Schuylkill. Think you, Captain Tracy, that we shall be able to surprise the enemy?” “I think the movement might be effected with care and celerity, your Excellency.” A shade of thought came over the noble brow of the Commander-in-chief, and he leaned his head musingly upon his hand for an instant. “Gentlemen,” he exclaimed, after the pause of a moment, “I need not tell you that every thing depends upon the suddenness and secresy of our movements. If we surprise the enemy, we shall terminate this disastrous war, and win the best of all boons, our country's Independence; if the enemy are on the alert, and ready to receive us, it is more than probable that the superior discipline of his troops will triumph over the irregular bravery and undisciplined courage of a great portion of the army which I have the honor to command. What think ye, gentlemen?” And as each hardy veteran or brave aspirant gave his opinion, the scene assumed an appearance of interest, which told the deep and fixed determination of the American commanders, never to lay down the swords which they had so gallantly unsheathed, until the independence of their common country was achieved. The glaring light of the lamps, placed in the centre of the oaken table, cast a ruddy glow upon the faces and forms that clustered round the Commander-in-chief. His face so calm, so mild, and yet so full of that native dignity of expression, which tells of a mind formed to rule, was shown in the boldest light and strongest shade, as he turned from one brave man to another, to receive their opinions and suggestions on the coming contest. There was the towering form, and bold and open countenance of Wayne, whose sword-thrust never failed, and whose charge mowed the enemy's ranks, like the scathings of an earth-riven thunderbolt; there was the gallant Knox, with his bluff, honest visage, every line beaming good humor, and dignified by an expression of determined courage; there was the sagacious Greene, whose counsels were as full of wisdom as his sword was sure, and his mind clear and self-possessed in the hour of mortal conflict; and there gathered around the man upon whose shoulders heaven had placed the destiny of his country, were the brave men, who flocked from every hill and vale of the continent, from foreign lands, from the misrule of despotism in every part of oppressed Europe, from the hearth sides of their infancy, and the homes of their manhood, and thronged in one gallant band around the banner of freedom,—there they stood with their good swords that had tasted blood in many a battle girded to their sides, with their noble visages marked by scars, and darkened by the toil and exposure of battle, and with hearts as true and bold as ever beat in the bosom of the most chivalric knight or daring warrior of the age of gallant deeds and generous warfare. And standing by the side of Washington, was a young soldier, whose form was moulded with all the symmetry of manly beauty, whose cheek was yet warm with the bloom of early youth, and whose piercing eye and high forehead, with its bold outline, indicative of the highest order of mind, gave rich promise of the mature man, whose words of burning eloquence, were, in future years, to fall like the revealings of a seer on the ears of his countrymen. Washington, ever and anon, would incline his head to Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton, and listen to the suggestions he offered, with an interest of which older men might have been proud, or invite his opinion with an eagerness that showed how strong a hold the young soldier had attained in the heart of his commander. Little did the father of his country think of the future fate of the aspiring soldier! Little did he imagine that the youthful form by his side, would survive the perils of war, to die after the quietude of peace had succeeded to the strife of battle, in an inglorious combat, the fruit of a participation in the scenes of political conflict! The council lasted until an hour after midnight, when the plan of operations for the succeeding day being resolved upon, the various officers retired to their different commands, to snatch such hasty repose as the lateness of the hour might allow, and to make such arrangements for the coming conflict as might tend to ensure success to the American arms. And under the broad canopy of Heaven, unsheltered from the dews and damps of the night air by covering or tent, slept the brave soldiers of the American host, as soundly, as securely, as though the coming morn was to bring scenes of peace and quietness, instead of the turmoil and bloodshed of battle. As Herbert Tracy stood gazing upon the scene around, from the elevation of the Haunted House; as his eye wandered from the vast dome of the heavens above, hung with a million stars, to the landscape, with its hills covered with forests, its cultivated valleys, and its level fields, along which were scattered the masses of the Continental army, the thought of the coming contest, and the fearful effects it might produce, flashed like a meteor-light across his mind. “How many a brave heart that now beats warmly, will to-morrow night be cold and torpid under the freezing touch of death! Many a noble form will measure out the hasty grave of the battle field —many an eye will be dimmed—many a hand stiffened, and many an arm unnerved—but come success or come defeat, for me will remain the same forbidding destiny, over my head will lower the same dark cloud, heavy with the lightnings of a father's curse!”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">BOOK THE SECOND. CHEW'S HOUSE. CHAPTER THE FIRST. THE BATTLE MORN. The morning of Saturday, the 4th of October, 1777, dawned slowly and heavily; and the sky was obscured by dimly defined masses of clouds and mist, that overhung the pathway of the sun, and extended, like one vast shroud, along the dome of heaven, enveloping hill, and plain, and stream, in the density of its folds. Objects were not discernible at more than fifty paces, and, not unfrequently, the weary eye of the soldier in vain essayed to define the outline of marching troops, opposing enclosures, brushwood or trees, not more than twenty paces in front of his path. As the first glimmering of dawn began to steal over the landscape, the American army resumed their march, unmarked by the roll of drum or the peal of trumpet. The only sounds that disturbed the silence of the atmosphere were the monotonous tread of men and horses, shaking the earth, like the low moaning of far off thunder, and ever and anon the words of command, uttered in a suppressed tone of voice, passed along the line; and these sounds, mingled with the jar of clanking swords, the shrill neigh of the mettled war-horse, and the thousand half subdued noises that accompany the movements of a large body of armed men, were all the tokens that served to warn the surrounding farmers and peasantry to flee from the scene of the approaching conflict. At the head of the central body, with Wayne on one side and Sullivan on the other, rode the Man of the Army, his tall form seeming yet more lofty, as it loomed through the mist, and his face impressed with an expression of solemn determination, as he gave to his various aids-de-camp the orders of the day, the directions regulating the march, or as he imparted farther instructions in relation to the attack and surprise. The deep and prolonged murmur and half-suppressed bustle, that was heard to the right and left of the central body, served to show that the divisions of Greene and Stephen on the left wing, and the militia of Maryland and Jersey on the extreme left, as well as the brigade of Pennsylvania on the extreme right, were defiling east and west, to take their respective positions in the approaching struggle. As the central division advanced in regular order over the fields, and through the woods, that lay between the Haunted House and Chestnut Hill, the fog seemed to deepen, and the light of day served only to render the gloom more apparent, and objects around, more vague and shadowy. The Black Rangers were some two hundred yards in advance, and a quarter of a mile to the right of the main body, on the look out for scouts and foraging parties of the enemy. They had arrived within a mile of Chestnut Hill, and were ascending a circular elevation of earth, crowned with a thick copse, when the quick ear of Harry Heft first discerned the sounds of laughter, the clank of swords, and the pattering of horses' hoofs, on the opposite side of the hill, beyond the woods. “With your permission, Captain, I'll jist ride up to the top 'o th' hill and see what them suspicious sounds might mean.” “Do so, Lieutenant,” replied Herbert. “It strikes me that your eye will discover some stray foraging party who have lost their way in the fog. Just approach near enough to ascertain their force and position—don't thrust yourself heedlessly into danger.” “And sure, Capt'in,” exclaimed Dennis, “might n't it be jest as well for meself to ride to the opposite side of the hill, in a different direction from that taken by the Leftenant, and take a dacent peep at the Britishers—if Britishers they be?” The Captain nodded assent, and while the party halted, at some fifty paces from the copse at the summit of the elevation, Harry Heft puts purs to his horse, and galloped around the eastern side of the ascent, while Dennis pursued his way toward the western side. Harry passed through the copse, and gained the opposite brow of the hill, where, reining in his steed, he tried to discover the nature of the ground. Below him, for some twenty paces, the hill sloped down in a gentle descent, and was then lost in the obscurity of the fog, from the bosom of which, far down in the valley, came drunken shouts, mingling with snatches of songs, and the sound of horses' hoofs. “Let's see,” soliloquized Harry, “where am I, and what 's this place like? Ah! now I have it— this hill slopes down into a small valley, which it encircles in the shape of a new moon—and now that I think of it, there is a level outlet from it toward the south, opening into a flat bottomed piece of swampy ground. On all other sides it is circumvented by a semi-cerclar woods, and it strikes me, them strangers, whoever they be, must be takin' a frolic right in the lap of the hollow. By the Continental Congress, what's that?” The sound that attracted Harry's attention, was the quick and sudden noise of horses' hoofs, mingled with vindictive shouts, as though their riders were in close pursuit of an enemy. Nearer and nearer the sounds of pursuit drew, and Harry was about to obey the impulse of the moment and rush down into the valley, when the jarring report of a pistol broke upon the air, and the concussion lifted the fog for some fifty paces below the spot where stood the gallant Ranger. As the mist slowly rose, like the upraising of a vast curtain, Harry beheld a sight that sent the blood, in one wild, warm current, to his heart. Quick as the lightning flash he beheld two soldiers in the crimson uniform of British troopers, mounted on stout, fleet horses, galloping up the hill at the top of their speed, their swords suspended in the air, and their arms nerved to strike a wounded man, who drooping to one side of his steed, essayed to escape up the ascent, while his noble horse made almost supernatural efforts to increase his speed. At the same instant that Harry saw the wounded man and his pursuers, he beheld a body of some dozen dragoons galloping in the rear; while down the hill, in the centre of the valley, the main force of the company (some twenty troopers in all) were gathered around a fire, in the act of springing upon their horses, as if disturbed by some unexpected alarm. Scarce had Lieutenant Heft time to gather these particulars at a hurried glance, and ere he could draw a bridle rein, or give his horse the spur, he discovered that the wounded man was none other than his companion Dennis, and at the same moment his cry for quarter broke upon the air; but the uplifted swords of the dragoons descended, winged with all the force of their muscular arms, and the body of the American Ranger was hurled to the earth, while the riderless horse dashed by Harry Heft with his neck arched, his eyes distended, his mane flying, and the saddle on his back smoking with his master's blood. Raising his rifle to his eye, with his blood boiling with rage at the scene of merciless carnage which had but now taken place under his very vision, Harry Heft brought the glittering barrel to bear upon the foremost of the troopers, and, in a flash, a lifeless body fell from the war horse, and the green sod bore upon its bosom the murderer and the murdered—the dragoon in his scarlet attire and gay trappings, and the free hearted Irishman in his uniform of black, changed to a ghastly purple by the red current that poured a gushing torrent from his heart. The sharp cracking sound of Harry's rifle had not ceased to ring upon the air, when the war shout of the Black Rangers swelled through the woods, and in an instant, dashing through the copse, as one man, the brave “twenty-four,” with Herbert at their head, followed Harry down the hill at 5 the top of their horses' speed, each man with his short, straight sword raised in the air, adding vigor and volume to the yell of vengeance which arose from the band, as each eye beheld the bleeding form of Dennis the Irishman. Down the hill they came, their gallant steeds moving with one impulse, as though they were but limbs of the same vast animal. At the sight, the twelve British Dragoons halted half way up the hill, in the full sweep of their career, and with horses recoiling on their haunches, seemed scarce to know whether to face the advancing avalanche, or to fly before its approach. Not an instant had they for reflection, for the Black Rangers came on toward them with the speed of a thunderbolt, and the voice of Harry Heft was heard above all other sounds— “Rangers—Dennis cried for quarter, and they murdered him! Shall we give them quarter?” “No quarter,” shouted Herbert Tracy, raising himself in his stirrups and measuring the distance between his men and the twelve dragoons, with a glance of his eye, “no quarter! no quarter! The bullet and the sword for the caitiffs. Over them, Rangers, over them!” “No quarter!” echoed the Rangers, “no quarter!” “Dennis McDermott!” shouted Harry. “The trumpeter boy!” replied Sergeant Brown. “Over them! Down with the caitiffs!” reechoed the Rangers, with one voice, “no quarter!” And in one compact body, of four abreast, with their steeds presenting a firm and unwavering front, the Black Rangers passed like a whirlwind over the shrinking forms and recoiling horses of the twelve dragoons. And as the Nighthawks swept on, with their front unbroken and their ranks undisturbed, the British soldiers rolled on the earth, some crushed beneath the weight of their horses, others with their arms and legs broken, and others pouring forth their lives on the sod, from the mortal gash inflicted by the short swords of the Rangers, in the very crisis of their charge; and all of them, man and steed, were scattered upon the earth, an indiscriminate mass of crushed bodies, of mangled horses and dying men. As the Rangers passed on in their career of death, down the hill and toward the centre of the valley, the main body of the British dragoons formed in solid phalanx in the level of the vale, presenting a front of four abreast, with a wood on either side of their position, and the passage of the glen visible in their rear. The fog had been raised from the bed of the valley, by the action of the large fire which the dragoons had kindled, and the light wreaths of mist curled gracefully among the treetops and around the hills, leaving the small level plain perfectly clear from all obscurity, and free from all exhalations. CHAPTER THE SECOND. THE CHARGE. The British Dragoons awaited the approach of the Rangers with sword drawn, and steeds firmly planted against each other, in a solid parallelogram, and with the determination to avenge their comrades, whom they could not save, visible in each countenance, in the flashing eye, the curling lip, and scowling brow. The Americans came thundering on, and twenty paces lay between them and their foes. Another moment and they would join in deadly contest, swords would flash, and bullets whistle, and their blood intermingle like streams of water. At this moment, when every breath was hushed with intense expectation, the deep-whispered word of command came from the lips of Herbert Tracy, and with the celerity of thought, his men divided from one another, like drops of rain from the bursting cloud, and in an instant, the forms of twelve of their body were concealed in the woods to the right of the British soldiers, while the other twelve with Tracy at their head, sought the cover of the forest on the opposite side of the vale. Each Ranger reined his steed up by the trunk of some giant tree, and lifting his rifle to his shoulder, brought its tube to bear upon the head of a particular dragoon, or in common parlance “picked his man;” and as the British soldiers turned to pursue their scattered foes, a stunning report broke from the woods on either side, and of the twenty-three rifle balls, nineteen proved faithful to the aim, and as many steeds were without riders, while the ground was strewed with the British dead. Herbert, too, had raised his rifle, and selected for his mark, the breast of the commander of the party, the barrel was leveled, his finger on the trigger, but at that instant the officer in issuing some hurried command to his men, turned his face toward Captain Tracy, and the arm of the Partizan Leader dropped nerveless by his side. He beheld the face of Lieutenant Wellwood Tracy, and he could not kill him. Lieutenant Wellwood Tracy, his antagonist in love, in honor, in the affections of his father; the man who made no scruple of usurping every right belonging to him by the decree of God and nature, was before him, in the line of his rifle, and yet he could not fire. The British Lieutenant looked confusedly round the dead and the dying about him. Ere he could attempt an escape, he was surrounded by the two divisions of the Rangers, uniting from either side of the vale, with the tall and commanding form of Herbert Arnheim Tracy towering in the midst. “Dennis McDermott! shouted Harry Heft, whose blood was turned to gall, in his stern determination to avenge the Irishman—“Down with the Britisher! No quarter!” “The trumpeter boy!” cried Sergeant Brown— “No quarter!” “No quarter!” re-echoed the Rangers, and twenty-three swords were unsheathed over the head of Wellwood Tracy. The British Lieutenant glanced hurriedly around, and seemed endeavoring to recover his self-possession, when Herbert Tracy threw his horse between the Rangers and the object of their anticipated vengeance. “Rangers, I beg this man's life of ye!” he exclaimed—“He must not, shall not be slain! Lieutenant Tracy, you are my prisoner.” “So I perceive,” observed the Lieutenant, with a ghastly attempt at humor. “But a moment since, you might have been indebted to these gentlemen for ridding you of the care of a prisoner, in the most expeditious, if not the most honorable way. You might, by —!” “It is ill jesting with men whose swords are whetted for blood, by the sight of a murdered comrade,” replied Herbert, placing himself at the head of his men, and galloping toward the spot, where Dennis McDermott had been murdered, “look to your prisoner Sergeant Brown.” The Rangers arrived on the spot half way up the hill, where lay the dying Ranger, for life had not yet altogether departed from his manly frame. He was terribly gashed, a deep sword wound laid open the scalp of his head, and his shoulder blade was broken, by a downward blow that had evidently been propelled by no weak arm. A stream of blood flowed without intermission from a bullet wound near his heart, and the crimson current had flooded the sod on which he lay, and was now trickling down the hill. “Dennis, my boy,” said Harry, kneeling beside the wounded man, “look up, Dennis, my boy! We paid the scoundrels for their treachery—we did! For every drop of your blood, a bucket-full of the British puddle has been spilt. Look up, Dennis, my boy!” The dying man passed his hand over his eyes, and wiped away the blood, which streamed from his gashed forehead, and obscured his vision. “Ye paid 'em did ye?” he exclaimed, faintly, as Harry supported his head. “Aye, did we. Thirty of the red coats have bitten the dust.” “Thirty, did ye say? be jabers, Harry—ochone! The wife and the childer be the Lake—the Lake of Kill—Kill—Och! I'm kilt meself. Will ye not wipe the blood out o' my eyes, Harry Heft—I'd like to see—to see—sure the sun's going down, Harry Heft, and its getting dark—It's a lone world I'm going to, Harry Heft, and never a priest to show me the way. Remimber me, Harry—masses for me sowl—Och! but it's dark!” And with a rattling sound at the throat, like suffocation, the brave Ranger made a desperate struggle, as though he were wrestling with some invisible foe, and then, with a faint attempt to clear the blood away from his eyes, he sunk into the arms of Harry Heft, and ceased to live. Thick, burning tears streamed down the bluff Ranger's cheeks, as he gazed at the lifeless corse. “If I don't make 'em pay for this,” he muttered, “it's no matter; that's all.” “Comrades!” exclaimed Sergeant Brown, “we'll have to shout two watchwords in the field to-day. `This for the trumpeter boy' for every shot we fire, and `that for Dennis McDermott' for every sword cut we make.” A deep murmer of assent arose from the Rangers, who with their Captain gathered round the corse of the murdered man. “I am really sorry,” exclaimed Lieutenant Wellwood Tracy advancing, that my drunken troopers, by such a barbarous act, should have provoked such a sanguinary massacre of my whole command—I am sorry, by —!” “Lieutenant Tracy,” interrupted Herbert, “if you are willing to give me your parole of honor, not to bear arms against the American forces until you are properly exchanged, I will accept it, and you may depart at your own pleasure.” The Lieutenant seemed not very well pleased at this sudden interruption, however he gave his parole of honor, mounted his horse, and galloped toward the British lines. Callous and cold hearted as was Lieutenant Tracy, it was not without some feelings of emotion, that he looked back, from the passage of the vale, to the scene of the late skirmish, and marked in place of the lusty soldiers, who had accompanied him thither, the mangled forms of the dying and the dead strown over the sod, which was crimsoned with their blood. “Mount, Rangers, and away!” shouted Herbert. Hark! They are in action at Chestnut Hill! Mount, and away!” “Captain Tracy,” exclaimed a voice from among the heap of wounded and dying, “for a cup of water, I can tell ye a tale that it might like ye to hear. Miss Waltham—” “Miss Waltham? What of her?” “The water first—the water—” murmured the wounded man. The water was brought from a brooklet, that ran down the side of the hill, and having drained the canteen to the last drop, the trooper proceeded with his story. He proved to be the drunken soldier, who had come in contact with Harry at the Quaker's house, where he had been suffered to rest under the table until late at night, when by some means or other, he became possessed of the fact that Miss Waltham was in the farm house. Wandering along the fields, he fell in with his master, the Lieutenant, who was just returning to camp after the fruitless search for his bride. He presently became aware of Miss Waltham's hiding place, and with Col. Musgrave proceeded to the farm house, informed the young lady that they felt bound to escort her across the country, to the mansion of a friend, where the Colonel was quartered, and where she could remain, until the pleasure of her father might be known. Miss Waltham begged to be taken to her father's house, but that was impossible, the Colonel said; they were bound to hurry across the country and be with their commands by day break; and the only way left them to manifest their interest in her safety, and protect her from the violence of a rebel leader (they affected to treat Herbert as an entire stranger) was to request her attendance, to the mansion of a common friend. Glad, at all events to have escaped the hated marriage, Miss Waltham yielded her consent, to what she could not well refuse, and accompanied the Colonel and Lieutenant to the mansion which they designated. “Well, my wounded terror of turkies,” exclaimed Harry, when the trooper had proceeded thus far, “had I known last night that you been up to cuttin' sich deviltries, I'd a put a stopper on you, mighty quick. I say, Captain, these red coats are swelling their account—it 'ill be full a'ter a while.” “Mount, Rangers, mount and away!” shouted Herbert, who had mused deeply on the trooper's story—“we will have warm work to-day, by that firing yonder! Away, Nighthawks?” CHAPTER THE THIRD. THE ATTACK—THE CHASE—THE HAVOC. “Look!” shouted Herbert Tracy, as he halted his steed for an instant on the brow of a hill, within pistol-shot of the Germantown Road, below Mount Airy. “Look ye, my Rangers, how the Loyalists flee! See how the Continentals sweep all before them—there's Mad Anthony—I'd swear to the stroke of his sword—and there's Pulaski—there's Washington in the very centre of the melee. A blow for Washington, Rangers! Whoop and away!” With an answering shout, the Rangers dashed down the hill, and swept across the plain toward the Germantown Road. While Herbert Tracy was engaged with the troop of Lieutenant Wellwood, a mile westward of Chestnut Hill, the central body of the American troops, under Wayne and Sullivan, with Washington at their head, had reached Mount Airy, surprised a battalion of light infantry, lodged in Allen's house in that vicinity, and, by a bold and determined movement, drove the enemy before them at pleasure, following up the work with all the flush and heat of an unexpected triumph. Scattering their arms along the way, or ever and anon turning to face their pursuers, the remains of the battalion of light infantry proved the aptness of their name, and, in the course of fifteen minutes, fled precipitately down the Germantown Road, for the distance of three-quarters of a mile, until they reached the point where the 40th Regiment was stationed, under the command of Col. Musgrave. Here the attack was renewed with all its vigor, and the American soldiers pressed forward as one man, and engaged with the British muzzle to muzzle. Col. Musgrave was seen hurrying hither and thither along the lines, and the form of a tall, dark-browed man, in the dress of a private citizen, with a star of honor on his left breast, was ever at his shoulder, aiding him in his attempts to restore confidence to his men, and riding in the very thickest of the fight. But it was in vain. In vain did the British infantry plant their muskets in the sod, and sinking on one knee, present to the advancing Americans a wall of bristling bayonets. The charge of Wayne came thundering on, and his loud war-cry—“Upon them! over them!” rose above the din of battle. In vain did the British dragoons form in one solid front, and with upraised sword, sweep on to meet the American infantry. They were received mid-way by the fire of the back-woodsmen, each rifle marking its man; and each shot told as surely and effectually as though it was aimed at an inanimate rather than a living mark. The confusion of the scene increased with each moment. Vast clouds of thick smoke began to roll in heavy folds over the field of contest, and from its bosom flashed the glare of musquetry, and the blaze of the rifle, while the clash of intermingling swords, the shouts of the combatants, the yells of the dying, shrieks of the wounded, swelled upward to the Heavens, in one fearful chorus, more terrible to hear than the sound of the most fearful convulsions of nature, the rumbling of the earthquake amid the subterranean caverns, or the thunder peals bursting around the summit of the Andes. These sounds strike us with preternatural fear and awe, but the confusion of a battle-field not only thrills us with a feeling of indefinable awe, but awakens our sympathies almost to madness. In every shout, a man formed like ourselves bites the dust, in every groan the earth is crimsoned with the life current of the wounded, in every peal of musquetry a score of souls wing their way from all the flush of life and vigor of active manhood, up to that unseen and spiritual world that is encircled with all the shadowy creations of the brightest hopes and darkest terrors of the human mind. At this crisis of the contest, Captain Tracy, at the head of his Rangers, came rushing on to join the tide of conflict. Each man with his head erect, his sword drawn, and his nighthawk plume fluttering in the wind swelled the shout of vengeance, as they poured upon the British host, and as each rifle winged its bullet, or as each sword sought its living sheath, the war cry of the Rangers rose high above all other sounds—“This for Dennis McDermott!” “This for the trumpeter boy!” “It is in vain!” cried Colonel Musgrave to the gentleman in citizen's dress who stood at his side— “Major Tracy we must beat a retreat! The rebels fight like incarnate devils! Away—away to the main body—away toward Chew's house!” As the order was passed along the British line, the Americans followed up the attack with increased zeal, and the scene became one of deadly chase and precipitate pursuit on the Continental side, and of hurried rout and confused retreat on the part of his Majesty's 40th regiment. In utter confusion, and heedless of all system or regularity of march, the British soldiers fled along the Germantown road, down toward the main line, at the distance of three-quarters of a mlle. “Now, Wayne, now!” shouted Washington, as he rode in the van of the chase—“Follow up the blow and we have them!” “See! how they fly!” exclaimed Herbert with an outburst of the wild excitement of the scene, “On, Rangers, on! This for Dennis McDermott! Over them, Rangers, over them! This for the trumpeter boy!” “This for Dennis McDermott!” shouted Harry Heft at each stroke. “This for the trumpeter boy! This for Dennis McDermott!” re-echoed the Rangers, as they rode over the retreating enemy, and scattered panic and confusion among the British by their singular appearance, their uniform of sable, their short sword, which they used with a celerity and expedition that defied all the tactics of the European soldiers, and their rifle that uttered its volume of flame every instant, while their jet black horses swept on with the speed of wind. Meanwhile, far on the American left, to the westward of Chew's house, Greene engages with the enemy's right, and the militia of Maryland and Jersey attack his rear, at the same time that the Pennsylvanian troops pour down the Ridge Road, and throw their force upon the left of the British wing. The sounds of battle disturbed the quiet shades of the Wissahikon, and resounded over the fields, along the village, to the hills on the east, and every movement of the opposing combatants, tended to make Germantown the centre of the contest. The fog which had been raised for a moment at sunrise, again passed over the landscape, and involved the scene of strife in mist and darkness that gave additional horror to the fight. As the divisions of Wayne and Sullivan swept along the Germantown Road in the pursuit of the enemy's 40th regiment, the conflict, to the British left, began to deepen, and the smoke of battle rolled over the farm house of the Friend Joab Smiley, who stood gazing from a window upon the scene of strife and bloodshed. Dame Smiley sat in one corner of the apartment with her face buried in her hands, to veil her eyes from the vivid flashes of the cannon, which like lightning ever and anon streamed through the windows. Her daughter, the fair Marjorie, with her dark hair all dishevelled, and her hands clasped in silent prayer, buried her face in her mother's bosom, in a half-kneeling, half-reclining position, while her bosom heaved upward from its scanty covering, and sobs and sighs of indefinable terror convulsed her slender form. Near the mother and daughter, with his large eyes fixed upon his massive, pawlike hands, which were laid upon his knees, sat the negro, “Charles the First,” whose wanderings across the country, on his way to Major Tracy's mansion, had been suddenly terminated by the conflict of the opposing armies, and he was forced to seek shelter in the farm house of the Quaker. Apart from all the others, looking from the northern window of the apartment, stood the Quaker farmer, his muscular form raised to its full height, his head erect, and his stout arms folded upon his prominent chest, as he gazed sternly upon the scene of conflict. The surrounding hills and woods were enveloped in the thick fog that enshrouded the entire face of the country, yet still the Quaker could perceive the form of men mingling in deadly conflict, and the red glare of the cannon would for an instant lift the curtain of mist, and the scene of death was laid bare to his view. “There—there—is the flag of the Continentals,” he exclaimed—“Now it is down—there sails the cross—the blood red cross of the British men. Verily it is terrible to see so much strife and bloodshed. Now the Americans march up the hill— there go their war horses—now they are driven back—Ha!—Verily!” The Quaker drew a long breath, and stifled the exclamation that was about to issue from his lips. “I am a strong man,” muttered the farmer, “and I stand and look on while my neighbors are murdered. Verily, Hannah, I will even go forth to the field—I will forth to the field, Hannah—Ha! Verily!” “Surely, Joab”—exclaimed his wife, starting on her feet—“thee will not so far forget thee God, and thee brethren, as to mingle in the strife of battle? Joab—Joab—I cannot think thus hardly of thee?” “Father, father”—shrieked Marjorie—“thee will not peril thy life among the men of war— father go not forth”— The maiden's utterance was choked by sobs, and she fell weeping upon her mother's shoulder. “Ha! verily! I will go forth—alone—there may be wounded who cry in vain for the cup of water—the maiden Waltham may be in danger. Harry Heft may be dying, and I standing here like a block of stone, looking calmly on. I must go forth to the field, wife—hold me not, daughter. I must forth—I'll be with ye presently”— “Sure's my name's Chawls de Fust”—exclaimed the negro, rising from his deep cogitations, “I'll go to Massa Chew's house too. Missa Waltham may be dar alone and de debble to pay. De Britishers may shoot me—I hab but one life— Massa Smiley I go wid you. Dat am a fac.” “Charles thee is a good fellow. Come with me if thy heart fails the not. Nay, wife, I must forth to the field!” The Quaker and the negro servant issued from the farm house door, and took their way to the scene of contest, and while the mother and daughter gazed from the window, they disappeared in the folds of the surrounding fog. CHAPTER THE FOURTH. CHEW'S HOUSE. “There is but one hope for us!” shouted Colonel Musgrave, as his regiment rushed in full retreat toward the British line. “One hope, Major Tracy! If that fails, our forces will be defeated—Philadelphia retaken—and the rebel cause triumphant! We must make a fortress of Chew's House—yonder mansion of stone—its walls are in some places three feet thick, and we can hold the place for hours! Away to Chew's House!” Major Tracy, by his words and example, encouraged the scattering regiment to press onward toward the mansion, which stood retired from the road at the distance of near two hundred yards. It was, and is, a substantial edifice, built of the most lasting stone, which will resist the tooth of time for ages. It stands facing the road, with two wings of stone supporting it in the rear, and toward the north—at the time of the Romance—the edifice presented a plain side of stone, only varied by two deep-silled windows, which gave light to that part of the mansion, one in the first and the other in the second story. The roof descends with a gentle slope, and the eves are defended by massive cornices, which give an appearance of solidity and strength to the building. In front of Chew's Mansion, on the battle morn, lay a wide lawn, reaching over two hundred yards to the main road of the village, extending south the same distance, and spreading toward the north, in an open field, of some four hundred yards in extent. This lawn was defended along the road by a wall of stone, and a few trees were scattered here and there over its surface, while an enclosure of sheds and fences, for confining cattle, was pitched some fifty yards to the north of the mansion, in direct view of the northern windows. In the north window of the second floor of the mansion, Marian Waltham sat gazing through the gloom and obscurity of the mist, upon the lawn that encircled the edifice. Her fair bosom trembled with indefinable terror as she listened to the increasing tumult of battle, with her head inclined to one side, her blue eyes brightening with interest, and her lips parted with intense anxiety. This terror the kind offices of the housekeeper of the mansion, whose portly form was seated at her side, in vain endeavored to dispel or assuage. “La! Miss Waltham, what's the use of taking on so!” exclaimed the housekeeper, giving the keys at her girdle an important rattle. “As sure as my name's Betty Fisher, and as sure as Mr. Chew's family are all at Phildelphy, leaving me to take care of this place, as sure as I've had to pervide for Col. Musgrave, and all his rampaging red-coats, jist so sure will you be as safe here, as though you were in your own father's parlor, over on the Ridge Road. And so a rascally rebel run off with you— did he? The ragmuffin! Jist as you were a-goin' to be married, too? How unpolite—” Miss Betty Fisher's round and rubicand face assumed an expression of intense curiosity, and her voluminous figure moved closer to Miss Waltham's side. “How kind in Col. Musgrave to rescue you from the rebels' clutches! I b'lieve my heart that old Quaker was at the bottom of it all—I do! Jist to think—goodness grashus! What's that—coming from the fog—oh! Lud!” Miss Waltham gazed with a hurried gesture from the window, at the exclamation of the house-keeper, and beheld, rushing from the depths of the fog, which concealed all objects beyond thirty paces in the vicinity of the mansion, a confused band of British soldiers, some mounted, others on foot, who ran with shouts and imprecations towards the hall door which opened on the lawn. The soldiers continued to pour along the lawn for the space of several minutes, in the same irregular stream, regardless of order or discipline; some of their number were covered with blood; others had their uniform soiled and torn; others were destitute of arms, and the entire body presented all the appearances that accompany defeat and dismay. “There's Col. Musgrave!” screamed Betty Fisher, “and there's Major Tracy all covered with dust and blood, among the rumpaging troopers! Oh! Lud! here's a purty how d'ye do—and in Mr. Chew's house, too! Goodness grashus!” Ere Marian had time to wonder at the appearance of Major Tracy and Col. Musgrave, in the plight in which she saw them, the room in which she was seated was filled with British soldiers, and Miss Betty Fisher hurried her fair charge away, to an obscure corner of the mansion. While the preparations for an obstinate defence were progressing in every part of the mansion, the American troops, in pursuit of the flying enemy, arrived in full chase, along the Germantown Road, in front of the field in which the edifice was situated. Herbert Tracy with his men, placed, together with the Partizan Legion of the brave Lee, near the person of the Commander-in-Chief, swept on in the very van of the pursuit. When the American forces were called to a sudden halt, in front of the mansion, so thick were the clouds of dust, and the smoke of battle that rolled over their heads, and so dense was the fog that enveloped their line of march, that when the young captain gazed around him, all objects beyond the vicinity of his own men, were wrapt in obscurity. The stately form of Washington, surrounded by his staff, was visible, however, amid all the mist and gloom, as an aid-de-camp came galloping up, and gave information of the lodgment of Col. Musgrave with six companies of infantry in Chew's mansion. “Shall we press onward,” exclaimed Washington turning to the brave men around him, “in pursuit of the main body of the enemy who are flying before us, or shall we halt and dislodge the party of Col. Musgrave, who have thrown themselves into the mansion?” “Halt! by all means,” cried General Knox, “it is against every rule of warfare to leave a fortress, possessed by an enemy, in the rear.” “What!” exclaimed Col. Pickering, “Shall we call this a fort, and lose the very moment of success?” “Let us press onward!” cried Wayne, who at that moment rode up to the side of Washington, with his sword dripping with blood. “Let us press onward! Onward, and follow up the rout of the enemy, while our troops are flushed with success! Onward, and with another blow the day is ours!” “Onward!” exclaimed Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton. “This is the very crisis of the action. While we attack the house, the enemy will rally, and we shall see the laurel of victory plucked rom our brows in the very moment of triumph!” “Onward, and over them!” cried Captain Tracy. “Now the day is our own—in ten minutes we may flee from the very field of triumph with the British pressing on in our rear!” The cry was echoed by all the junior members of the staff, but their opinion was overruled by that of the veteran Knox, who, supported by other senior officers, advised an immediate attack upon the house. The roar of a steady fire of musquetry pouring from every window, from every nook and cranny of Chew's House, now came rolling through the fog, and scattered death and confusion through the American troops, who rushed into the very jaws of the enemy's artillery. Chew's House became the centre of the fiercely contested fight. Greene's column to the east were engaged hand to hand with the forces of the enemy in that quarter; Armstrong was thundering away into the ranks of the foe westward of the house, and every moment decreased the distance between the various wings of the opposing armies aad the centre of the battle. The American artillery was arrayed on the opposite side of the Germantown Road, at the distance of two hundred yards from the house, with the mouths of the cannon so arrayed, that the balls would strike the north-west corner of the mansion. The thunder of the cannon opened full on the 6 house, but the aim of the gunners was rendered uncertain by the pressure of the fog; and the American infantry were about to advance and attempt to carry the temporary fortress by storm, when it was determined to send a flag of truce and summon Col. Musgrave to surrender. A young and gallant officer, of Lee's Partizan Legion, was selected from among the throng who offered to bear the flag. Assuming the snow-white emblem of peace, held sacred by all nations, the brave soldier approached the house, and was within twenty paces of the hall door, when a blaze of flame issued from a window, and the young officer measured his grave upon the sod, while the flag of truce was stained with the warm blood of his heart. A yell of horror broke from the American army at this ghastly spectacle, and the attack upon the house was renewed with a keen desire on the part of each soldier to avenge the young officer, and as each column marched up to the mansion, the name of the murdered man accompanied each peal of musquetry and swelled high above the thunder of the cannon. The plan of the attack on Chew's house forced nearly one-half of the central body to stand by and witness the slaughter of their comrades before their very eyes, without being able to raise a hand in their defence. Taking advantage of this inactivity, General Grey wheeled the front of the left wing of the British army from his position east of Germantown, into the centre of the fight, and supported by the fourth brigade under General Agnew, opposed a successful and terrible resistance to the success of the American arms. The fire of the British musquetry, enveloping the field in one continual sheet of flame, was answered by the American fire flashing like forked lightning at quick intervals, and from the depths of the fog, arose the sound of host charging against host, the roar of the cannon, the cries, the shrieks, the groans of the wounded and dying, mingling with the voices of the different commanders, urging their men on to their various posts in the scene of conflict, but amid all the wild uproar of the battle, the deep muttered shouts of the Black Rangers broke upon the air, and their sable uniform gleamed through the white wreaths of smoke, as they thundered along the field in the thickest of the fight, accompanying the deadly fire with the war cry, “This for Dennis McDermott!” and each mortal stroke of the short, straight sword, with the shout—“This for the trumpeter boy!” Like a dark thunder cloud, emitting fire and flame from every point, the Rangers swept through the foe in one firm phalanx, making a lane of dead wherever they passed, and leaving the wounded and the dying scattered in heaps in their rear. The Americans fought, each man of them, as though the issue of the fight depended upon his separate hand and blow; they fought gallantly; they fought desperately; they fought undismayed by the heaps of dead that piled each step of ground on which they trod; but they fought against hope. The thick and gloomy mist still hung over the field like a shroud for their dead, and with its evil omen blasted every prospect of success. The fog threw the Americans on the left into inextricable confusion, and they turned their arms against each other. Many a brave Continental soldier, leveled his musket, through the mist, at what he supposed a foe, and found himself the murderer of a friend. The brave Col. Matthews, of Green's formidable column, passed to the east of Chew's house, and drove the British before him like a tornado; on every side they fled before the terror of his arms; and his regiment was soon swelled by the addition of three hundred prisoners. Returning to the main body in the heat and glow of triumph, he fell in with a body of friends—as he thought—and found himself a prisoner in the heart of the British army. Herbert Tracy and his Rangers came galloping up to the side of Washington in the thickest of the fight, prepared for any effort that might retrieve the fatal mistake of the halt at Chew's house. Never had Herbert seen the Commander-in-Chief, moved by such deep and powerful emotion as stirred through every fibre of his commanding frame when moment after moment, he leaned to one side of his steed, and received the reports of disaster and partial defeat, from aid-de-camp after aid-de-camp, who were hastening, some from Armstrong's brigade, some from the the command of Generals Smallwood and Forman, others from the column of Greene, and all bearing testimony of the fatal effects, of the want of co-operation and consolidation caused by the halt at Chew's house. Washington glanced around upon the scene of confusion and death. His face, usually so calm and mild in its aspect, was moved in every lineament by an expression stern as it was strange to those features so full of manly wisdom and dignity. His eye flashed, and his brow gathered a frown, such as had never before marked his countenance; his lips were compressed, and his tall figure, raised to its full height, with an utter recklessness of self preservation that appeared to possess him in that moment of agony, when he saw defeat hovering over the American arms. “Follow me, who lists,” he exclaimed, putting spurs to his steed—“We may even yet discover some vulnerable point around the fatal house.” He rode directly in the fire of the enemy, toward the northern wall of Chew's mansion, and in his train, fired by a generous emulation to share the danger of the noble man, rode the gallant Hamilton, the brave Pickering, and the daring Lee, side by side with Herbert Tracy, who surrendered his men, for the time, to the command of Harry Heft, and rushed on with Washington and his staff into the very jaws of the British cannon. Ere they were aware, the party found themselves riding within twenty paces of the northern wall of the mansion, with a deadly and incesssant fire of musquetry pouring from the upper window, and the bullets from the opposing armies sweeping by their heads like hail, while the sod at their horses' feet was furrowed by cannon balls. The danger was imminent, and nothing but interposition of a Higher Power could have saved the life of Washington in that dread moment. The officers of his staff with one voice besought him to fly, but, unheeding their exclamations, Washington rode directly along the northern wall of the mansion, and noted that the shutters of the lower window were closed, and that it was barricaded half way up by a heap of loose timber and brushwood piled upon the ground, while the muzzle of the British guns poured a constant shower of balls through loop-holes cut into the shutters. Having noted this fact,[1] [1] The following incident is given on the authority of Col. Pickering, who was in the staff of Washington on the day of the battle. the Commander-in-Chief turned his horse to the American lines, and, followed by his gallant band, rode forward, exposed to the fire of the contending armies, when mistaking their way in the fog, they presently found themselves entangled amid the sheds and enclosures of the cattle-pen, fifty paces from the mansion, with bullets peeling splinters from the timbers every instant, and cannon balls scattering dust and sand into their faces as they struck the earth on every side. “Save yourselves, gentlemen!” shouted Washington, and every member of the staff leaped his horse over the enclosure of boards, some three feet in height, and galloped northward toward the American lines, expecting Washington and Herbert Tracy to follow their example. “Leap, Captain Tracy, leap your horse and save yourself!” shouted Washington, as a bullet lodged in the pommell of his saddle. “Not till you are safe!” replied Tracy, facing the storm of battle with as much calmness and self-possession as though he were but breasting the career of a summer shower. “I cannot endanger the limbs of this noble horse by leaping yon fence,” exclaimed Washington. “He has borne me safe in too many a hard fought fight to think of it. Captain Tracy save yourself as best you may—I will take the path in front of the house where the fog is raised by the enemy's fire!” And ere Tracy could reply, Washington put spurs to his steed, who sprang through the gateway of the cattle-pen toward Chew's mansion, and leaping over the intervening ground with the speed of an arrow, bore the Commander-in-Chief toward the house. Herbert leaned to one side of his steed, and held his breath. Another moment, and Washington would be in the midst of the fire, pouring from the windows in front of the mansion. Another moment and his form would fall to the earth riddled by an hundred bullets! “He shall not fall alone by the Heaven above us!” shouted the young Ranger, giving his steed the rein, and galloping across the lawn toward the house—“There! there! He is in front of the house—he is down! no! He passes! He passes as I live—safe—safe and unscathed! Huzza! Away Night-hawks!” As Herbert followed in the footsteps of Washington, swept through the blaze of musquetry in front of the mansion, and taking a sudden circuit, disappeared in the fog toward the Germantown Road, as he gave his steed the rein, and rode over the bodies of the dying and the dead, that littered every foot of earth, the shrill and piercing sound of a female voice in an agony of fear broke upon the air from a small circular window in the northern wing in the rear of the building, and the face of a fair maiden, with eyes dimmed with tears, and a lip quivering with terror, was thrust out into the light, while with clasped hands and heaving bosom, Marian sent up a prayer to Heaven for the safety of her lover. “Oh! Heaven he is lost!” she exclaimed, as Herbert disappeared in front of the house, “he falls—he falls from his horse—they have killed him—murderers that they are! Nay, nay,” she continued, as Herbert re-appeared on his way to the main road over the lawn—“He is saved! Heaven be thanked! He is saved!” “Here's a purty how d'ye do in Mr. Chew's house,” exclaimed a familiar voice, and Miss Betty Fisher entered the small and dimly-lighted apartment with large drops of perspiration pouring down her round fat cheeks, her apron usually so neat and prim all torn into tatters, and her cap, soiled with soot and dust, suspended by a single thread to her hair. “Here's a purty how d'ye do, in Mr. Chew's house! I raley wish some folks 'ud stay at hom, and take care of their own duds. Oh, lud, such a fright as I've had!” Miss Waltham used all her efforts to calm the agitated state of Miss Betty Fisher's mind, but in vain. “Jist to think of it! I jist run down stairs to take a look a'ter the furnitur', and I'd got to the first landing, when what should I see—oh, goodness 6* grashus! there was Sergeant Thompson, sich a nice-portly man, a-laying at the foot o' the stairs, all his elegant ruffles kivered with blood, and all the furniture cracked to pieces, the mahogany tables split into bits, the carpets torn up—oh, lud, look there —look out o' the window, Miss Waltham—there's the ribbles (rebels) a-comin' to fire the house! Oh! now we'll be burnt up, and Mr. Chew's house will be turned into a bake oven.” Marian look from the window, and beheld twelve forms in dark attire emerging from the cover of the fog toward the house at a quick running pace, and at a second glance she recognized in the foremost figure the person of Herbert Tracy, brandishing his rifle, and leading his men into the very blaze of the British musquetry. The maiden took not another glance at the scene, but seized by a wild impulse of fear with the idea of her lover's safety uppermost in her mind, she rushed from the apartment, and scarce knowing whither she went, passed down the stairway, entered an open door, and in a moment stood by the side of Major Tracy, who, begrimed with dust and soot, was directing the fire of the soldiers from the windows of the northern parlor on the ground floor, toward which Herbert, unconscious of the vicinity of his father or his betrothed, was fearlessly approaching. CHAPTER THE FIFTH. THE MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND SON. “A band of twelve determined men might approach the northern window and fire the house,” exclaimed Washington, the moment he was rejoined by the officers of his staff within the American lines. “It is a work of imminent danger, however, and every man of the band will, in all human probability, fall a corse beneath the walls, although the attempt to fire the brushwood and timber by the northern window may meet with success. I despair of inducing any twelve in the army to make the attempt—what say you, gentlemen?” “I will be one of the twelve!” cried Herbert Tracy throwing himself from his steed. “I'll be another!” shouted Harry Heft, imitating his example. “And I another?” echoed Sergeant Brown, placing himself beside the captain and the lieutenant. “And I another! and I another!” the cry went round, until every man of the Rangers had thrown himself from his horse and swelled the line of the self-sacrificing band. “Here are nineteen men, Captain Tracy,” exclaimed Washington, and a gleam of pleasure brightened in his eye as he gazed upon the stout and muscular forms of the Rangers. “The others,” replied Herbert, “have laid their bones on the battle-field, or else I can assure your excellency they would not be found missing!” “Yes, yes, captain, but twelve men are sufficient, and here are nineteen.” “Will your excellency be pleased to divide those those who are to remain from the others?” “Where all are so brave,” replied Washington, “the task is no easy one. My friends,” he continued, “you who form the left of this brave line be pleased to step aside.” The seven Rangers stepped aside with the chagrin they felt visible on each countenance. “Now, Captain Tracy, I leave the matter to your discretion. God be with you!” With this exclamation Washington rode off with his staff to another part of the field, and Captain Tracy made his arrangements for the performance of the desperate task, upon which the success or defeat of the American arms might turn. In a few minutes each man of the twelve stood ready to start. Six of the number carried torches and combustible materials in their hands, while the other six, the captain and lieutenant included, grasped their rifles, loaded in both barrels, with a double charge, and prepared in every respect for immediate action. “Rangers,” exclaimed Tracy, “when we advance from the cover of the fog, those who bear rifles will rush forward, and fire in the very faces of the soldiers who guard the extreme north window in the front of the mansion. Those Rangers who bear the torches will then advance—fire the heap of brushwood and timber under the lower window in the northern wall—and while they are thus engaged, the rifles will pour a second discharge into the window, and then the entire body will retreat. Forward!” Herbert Tracy led the way over the lawn, strewed with dead and wounded, toward the mansion. Their path was enveloped in the clouds of battle, and the rain of bullets whistled by their ears or tore up the earth at every footstep. It was a dread moment, and each man of the band sent up a prayer to that God, before whom he presently expected to appear, and then every heart beat firmly and regularly, and every hand was nerved for the approaching scene of death. “By the Continental Congress!” shouted Harry, when they had gained their way within fifty yards of the mansion. “Jist look there! If there aint the old Quaker, Joab Smiley, and the darkey, `Charles de Fust,' right in the centre of the scrimmage! There's a vision, Rangers! Heaven help my eyes, but I never expected to see such a sight!” The Rangers looked across the lawn, and beheld at the distance of twenty paces, the Quaker kneeling beside a wounded man, who was placed against a tree, while the negro stood holding a flask at his shoulder. The battle was raging around him— men were measuring their graves within arms reach of the spot where he knelt, troopers were sweeping past on their way to join the contest, yet still did that plain, unfearing Quaker tender his kind offices to the wounded man, bathe his brow with water, and moisten his parched tongue, while the unsophisticated negro who stood at his shoulder, half scared to death, by the terrors of the scene, appeared urging him onward to Chew's house, where his mistress was in danger, whom the negro amid all his fears was determined to save. “The noble Quaker is in danger,” exclaimed Herbert as he glanced at the scene—“But we have no time now to interpose in his behalf! We must onward!” Every breath was hushad, as the Rangers began to discern the outline of Chew's Mansion, looming through the smoke and fog. “What mean those torches glimmering through the mist?” exclaimed Major Tracy, as standing amid a body of ten soldiers, placed in the extreme north window of the front of the house, he discovered the approach of the Rangers. “Ha! As I live, they are rebels, engaged in the execution of some desperate purpose. Now my men, now—stay—wait a moment—now, now. Let your aim be sure; pick every man of them; NOW!” The word of command rose to his tongue, when he felt a hand laid lightly on his arm. He turned and beheld the form of Marian Waltham; her blue eyes glaring wildly, her lips apart, her cheek pale as death, and her golden hair, flowing in disordered masses over her neck and shoulders. “Mr. Tracy—beware!” exclaimed the maiden, clutching his arm convulsively. “Pause, for the sake of Heaven, ere the blood of your son is upon your soul! Ere the Major could gather the meaning of the maiden's words, the voice of the foremost Ranger arose without—“Now, Nighthawks, now!” and the blaze of six rifles flashed from the lawn into the open window. Four British soldiers fell heavily to the floor, and with a wild shriek, Marian laid her hand upon her heart, her senses swam in wild confusion, and she sank at the feet of Major Tracy, insensible and motionless. “Follow me, every man of you!” shouted Major Tracy, leaping from the window out upon the lawn, while the smoke of the American rifles yet hung in heavy folds across the casement, and obscured the vision. Follow me, every man of you!” Scarce had the words died on the air, when alighting upon the slight embankment in front of the mansion, he glanced around and beheld through the smoke, a body of the Rangers in the act of firing the brushwood, beneath the northern window, while the other division were moving toward the window, raising their pieces as they advanced. Major Tracy sprang from the embankment: another leap and he stood within arms length of the advancing rebels. Raising his sword in the air, he glanced at the breast of the foremost Ranger, and prepared to plunge it in his heart, when a slight breath of air, wafted the smoke aside, and Major Tracy confronted his son. “Oh God—my father!” “My son!” He started back with the quick, instantaneous movement of surprise, his right arm dropped to his side, and with his dark, flashing eyes, starting from their sockets, while his eye-brows were woven together, with the sudden nervous expression, that trembled along every line of his face, he gazed upon the form of Herbert Tracy before him, and perused every lineament of his countenance, as if to assure himself that what he beheld was no phantom or unreal creation of the agitated fancy. And there stood the son, the same expression of intense surprise gathering over his face, his dark eyes flashing with the same deep glance, the same frown upon his brow, and his right hand grasping his good rifle drooped by his side, with the same impulse that unnerved his father's arm. Oh, what a wild contest was at work in that father's heart, as he thus stood gazing upon the child of all his hopes, now banned and cursed, by those lips that should have spoken but the words of blessing and the sounds of prayer; how fiercely were tumultuous feelings sweeping over his soul; how bitter was the struggle between nature and pride; between the long indulged feelings of natural affection, reviving in all the vigor and the new-risen bitternass of worldly ambition, opposing the remembrance of every kindly sympathy, with the stern thought,—he has set my will at defiance let the consequences be upon his own head; he has sown in the storm—let him reap the harvest of his folly in the whirlwind. At last words came to the father's tongue, and again the sword was poised in air. “Rebel!” he shouted between his clenched teeth—“Not thus did I think to meet thee, upon the battle field, with the weapon of thy disloyalty in thy hand—” “Father!”—shrieked Herbert, as all the memories of his infancy came crowding around his heart. “But, now, that met we are, here on this crimsoned sod, foot to foot and hand to hand, I tell thee, traitor, that thou or I must measure out a grave upon this field. Thou hast a sword—draw and defend thyself!” “Father!” cried Herbert spreading forth his hands, and dropping his rifle upon the earth, “Here is my breast! I make no defence—I offer no resistance—strike and fulfil your curse!” “Friend Tracy, thee must not harm thy child!” exclaimed a voice, familiar to the ears of father and son, and the stalwart arm of the Quaker, was thrust before the upraised hand of Major Tracy. “I tell thee, friend Tracy, thee must not harm thy own flesh and blood,” repeated the Quaker, as wresting the sword from the father's hand, with a grasp that it was vain to resist, he very coolly shattered it into fragments upon his knee. “Major Tracy, thee is not in thy right mind, or surely thee would not demean theeself so unwisely. And young man—does thee hear?—mount thy war-horse and get thee away from the field! Seest thou not that the Americans are fleeing around thee? Away with thee—away with thee! Thy own men are cut down before thee, in the very act of firing you window shutter—Ha! verily!” While Herbert, unheeding the scene of tumult and blood around him, sank on his knees, and clasped his father by the hands, the stout Quaker, Joab Smiley, strode aside to the window, where Harry Heft and Sergeant Brown were struggling amid the dead bodies of their comrades, against five of the British infantry, who had clubbed their muskets, and were raising them over the heads of the sinking Rangers, in the act of dealing the death blow. “Hold, friend, thee must not strike thy brother!” shouted the strong armed Quaker, throwing himself among the enraged British soldiers, wresting a musket from each arm, at every word,—“Thee has no business to strike thy brother, friend—what does thee want with this mischievous weapon?” he continued, forcing a musket from the grasp of one of the soldiers—“Nor does thee want this—nor thee this—(Harry Heft, get thee away and fly—thee and thy friend.) Ha! verily! Friend, friend, does thee resist me? Wilt not surrender thy weapon? Then must I use force! What business has thee a-walking about friend Chew's ground, a-cracking people on the head in this style? Hey? Friend? (Harry Heft, get thee away—thee and thy friend.) Nay, friends, ye must not resist—I am stronger than ye—away, Harry, away!” With these and similar exclamatiens, Joab scattered the muskets of the British soldiers, until Harry Heft and Sergeant Brown, were enabled to secure two horses out of the number of riderless steeds, that were galloping along the battle-field. “I say, Joab—uncle Joab,” cried Harry as he leaned from his prancing horse, “if ever any body speaks a word against a Quaker in my presence, may I be — to — if I don't lick the lie out of their hide, before they can say Jack Robinson! Hey! What's that, the Sargent gone too!” continued Harry, as the brave veteran Brown fell from his horse, wounded by a spent ball. “This has been a bloody day for the Rangers! Uncle—uncle Joab, I say! Lay hold of yon horse for the Captain! Hallo, there, captain—don't be kneelin' there to the old gentleman, when you should be makin' yourself missing! Captain, the day's against us, the Rangers are all killed, and we must be off.” Holding the horse, from which Sergeant Brown had just fallen, in his grasp, the Quaker approached the father and his kneeling son. “Father, your blessing, your blessing!” exclaimed Herbert, as he clasped the hands of his parent, who was gazing sternly upon him, as the Quaker drew nigh. “Herbert, I do not curse—I do not curse thee! But bless thee, I cannot, my son, while thy sword is raised in most unrighteous treason! I do not curse, for I cannot heap a deeper curse on thee, than the curse of loyal blood, which crimsons thy hands! I must never see thee more—never, never! And with these words the stern hearted Loyalist turned away, and his son never looked upon his living form again. “The day is indeed against us!” cried Herbert, turning to Harry Heft—“The Americans fly on every side, and yonder is Washington trying to stem the current. Let us away—yet hold”—he exclaimed, wheeling his plunging horse around— “I have naught left for which to live—I will die upon this field—I will die with my father's curse upon my head—” “Nay, young man,” exclaimed the Quaker, “that would be desperate, little better than suicide! Away with thee, away, while flight is in thy power!” “Fly, Herbert, fly!” cried a soft voice which made the young captain's heart throb with a feeling of wild surprise—“Fly, Herbert, for my sake, if not for your own—fly!” A fair hand was thrust from the small circular window in the northern wing of the mansion, and Herbert beheld the beaming face of his betrothed. One token of recognition was exchanged, and dashing his spurs into the flanks of his steed, side by side with Harry Heft, Herbert joined the retreat of the American soldiers, who swept in one wild torrent of defeat and disorder over the ground, where they had conquered at the break of day. “Massa Smiley—Massa Smiley,” cried “Chawls de Fust” issuing from the hall door of Chew's house. “My Missa Waltham am safe—she am, gorra-mighty—lor bless us! Dat am a fac! Sure's my name's Chawls de Fust.” “Verily, I must see the damsel”—exclaimed the Quaker—“She may be in trouble and distress, and I may comfort her. Nay, friends, look not so sourly at me”—he continued, as he observed the scowling brows of the British soldiers, who were rushing by him to join in the pursuit. “I did but take away your weapons for your good. Verify, I must see the damsel.” And with that he disappeared in the hall door. Chew's house was now entirely deserted by its late military occupants who all poured out of its precincts, to join the current of pursuit which thundered in the rear of the American host. Along the Germantown Road, over the fields and enclosures between the village and Chestnut Hill, fled the scattered bands of the American army. In vain did Washington endeavor to breast the tide of retreat, in vain did Pulaski at the head of his troopers, throw himself before the disheartened fugitives, and urge them by all that they held dear and sacred, to face the pursuing foe! All was in vain! And Greene and Wayne beheld their men, who had borne themselves so gallantly, ere the bright prospects of the day had been blasted at Chew's house, turn their backs to the foe, and flee in utter despair from that field, where heaven and earth had combined to defeat the American arms. How the American army retreated to the wilds of Perkiomen, how the wounded and the dying strewed the way, how the pursuit was maintained, and how most of the disastrous consequences of a retreat were avoided by the care and foresight of Washington, are all matters of historical relation, and we turn again to the blood-stained field of Germantown. CHAPTER THE SIXTH. SUNSET UPON THE BATTLE FIELD. The declining sun was again bathing the landscape in its golden beauty, and each sloping hill, and grassy pasturage, each leafy forest, dyed with hues of autumn, and each level plain dotted with orchards and varied by cultivation, looked more lovely in the setting sunlight, since the raising of the mist, had imparted new life and freshness to the view, than when the uncertain beams of the battle-morn glimmered among wreaths of clouds, and threw a dim and pallid light along the darkened air, deepened to the gloom of twilight by the smoke and dust of battle. “Will thee mount thy horse, Miss Waltham? Dost not see, young lady, that friend Tracy is mounted and ready to start? Nay, Betty Fisher do not detain the maiden with thy endless gossip, and Charles, man, what does thee stand grinning at there, like another chessy-cat.”[2] [2] Qu? Cheshire Cat. With many a warm expression of thanks and courtesy to Miss Betty Fisher for her care and attendance, Marian took the hand of the Quaker, and sprang from the hall steps of Chew's mansion, on to her favorite steed, which the watchful “Chawls de Fust” had conveyed from the mansion on the Ridge Road, over to Germantown, since the strife and turmoil of the battle morning. The fair form of Marian was robed in a green riding habit, which fitted closely and gracefully around her bust and shoulders, with a ruffle of delicate white encircling the snowy neck, while the skirt of the robe fell in voluminous folds over the maidenly proportions of her figure, and resting upon the saddle of her bounding steed, swept in a graceful train until it touched the very earth. Her glossy hair, with all its golden luxuriance, was confined within the pressure of a small riding hood, topped by a delicate white plume, and looped in front with a brooch of the brightest lustre. Marian's cheek, was deadly pale, and her eyes were swollen with weeping, for the thought of her father's death lay heavy at her heart, and as she glanced at the tall form of Major Tracy, mounted on his steed at her side, all the scenes of the day that was well nigh over, and of the preceding night, rose before her vivid fancy like the fresh remembrance of the horrors of some terrible dream. “Shall we move forward, friend Tracy? It lacks but an hour of sunset—Charles, mount thy horse; we must be moving.” “It reely makes me quite solemn-like to see you 7 all a-going, and scarce a soul in the house but myself!”—exclaimed Miss Betty Fisher, advancing to the side of Marian's horse. “Oh dear, oh, dear, here's been a purty day of it! And arter the unmannerly soldiers have filled Mr. Chew's house with dead, and broke the furnitur and scattered all the chiney all over the house—Oh! goodness me! They then must clear out Colonel Musgrave, Lieutenant Wellwood and all, leavin' me to look to their miserable place! Oh, lud, Miss Waltham, I shall never get over this fright for a twelvemonth. Don't look so sad—that's a dear”—continued the loquacious house-keeper. “It's a comfort to you to think, that the ribble officer did'nt run away with you quite—” “Verily, Miss Betty Fisher, thee will keep us here, listening to this prattle, until to-morrow morn. Let us push on, friend Tracy.” “Good bye, Miss Waltham!” screamed Betty as the party rode over the lawn—“Good bye, and rimimber me to all inquirin' friends.” “Gorra—mighty—lor bless me!” chuckled the negro—“Dat ar' woman got a tongue like de hopper of a flour mill! Clack—clack—and no stoppin' when it gets a gwoin. Dat am a fac.” As Marian rode along the lawn, toward the Germantown Road, on her way homeward, she could not help noting the awful quietness which had gathered over the battle field, in place of the noise and tumult of the morn. The grounds, as well as the mansion, were deserted by the British soldiers, and the dead were strewn over the surface of the lawn in ghastly heaps. The grass was trodden down, and wet with blood, while every indentation or hollow of the earth, was filled with a pool of the crimson current, and here and there were were crevices dug in the ground, by the rolling of the cannon wheels, now affording temporary channels for the reception of the clotted masses of human gore that made the lawn a marsh of carnage. Pieces of broken muskets, fragments of bayonets, remnants of shattered swords littered the ground, mingled with bullets and cannon balls, and all the ten thousand wrecks of war and battle-strife, were strewn along, amid the piles of dead bodies. The beams of the setting sun gilded the pale faces of the dead, with a momentary light that seemed like a bitter mockery of the ruddy glow of life, and the warm flush of health. Marian beheld death in every shape and position. Here an American soldier had fallen at the foot of a tree, and died with his back propped against the trunk, while his head fell to one side, and his mouth opened with a ghastly grin. One hand clutched the shattered musket-stock, and the other lay stiffened on the wound in his side. Close by him, a British soldier seemed to have been swept down in the very moment of the charge. His back was turned to the sky, one knee was bent in as if he had met the death wound when running, and his face was buried in the ground, while his arms were outstretched and his stiffened fingers were thrust into the upturned earth, as though he had grasped the sod, in the convulsive throes of mortal agony. Farther on lay a heap of dead, American and Briton, Scot and German, interlocked in one ghastly pile of mangled bodies, some with their faces upturned to the sunlight, some with their hands upraised as if to ward off the descending blow, others with every limb contorted by the spasm that attends a sudden and a painful death, while some there were who lay extended upon the earth as calmly and quietly as though they had but laid themselves down to take a pleasant sleep. Here lay a youth, clad in the rustic dress of an American farmer's boy. He lay on his side with his tangled brown hair thrown over his forehead, his sunburnt cheek crimsoned with spots of blood, and his plain and uncouth garments drilled with bullet holes, and torn by sword thrusts. His old-fashioned fowling piece, the companion of many a wild ramble amid the solitudes of the forest, lay near his side, and his arm was stretched out as though he grasped it in his death struggle, but the stiffened fingers could but touch the shattered stock without enclosing it in their dying embrace. And thus along the whole field, in each nook, each grassy hollow, along the surface of each level plane, were scattered those who had fallen in the morning's struggle, resting in all the ghastliness of death, upon the sod which had bounded beneath their tread at the hour of sunrise. Had aught been wanting to complete the picture, it was supplied by the presence of various mercenary wretches, who, hovering upon the outskirts of the field, stripped and plundered the dead, and scared away a flock of ravens, who had perched upon their victims, in anticipation of a plentiful banquet. “God of mercy!” exclaimed the Quaker, as his eye drank in the horrors of the battle field, “if ever the fancy might imagine that spirits of the dark world had built a loathsome mockery of every high and heavenly sympathy that dwells in the bosom of man, surely that mocking spectacle is here, and man outraging all feelings of brotherhood, all feelings of affection, all that is good or holy in his nature, has laid his fellow man down upon the earth in all the shapes of death, and every mangled limb and torn carcase, seems to bear witness that the Lord God dwelleth not in man, but rather that he is the temple of the Evil One!” As he spoke, the party reached the main road, and Major Tracy spurred on his steed some hundred yards ahead of his companions, and riding in full gallop, he seemed to woo the current of freshening air, as it swept over his hot brow and burning cheek, without for an instant allaying the fever of his mind. CHAPTER THE SEVENTH. THE BALL FROM THE GRAVE-YARD. Major Tracy rode along in front of the party until he reached a point where a quiet grave-yard looks out upon the village street. It was then, as it is now, somewhat elevated above the level of the main street, and a wall of rough, dark grey stone, separates it from the highway, and half shields its green mounds of earth, and its long lines of time-eaten tombstones, from the gaze of the passer by. He was riding thus leisurely along, with his head drooped low as if in thought, his eyes downcast, and his hands on his chest, while the loosened rein was thrown carelessly upon his horse's neck, and his entire manner betrayed the absence of all his musings from the real world around; he was riding thus leisurely along, and had well nigh gained the grave-yard gate, which opened into the pathway from the centre of the wall, when a loud and startling report broke upon the still air, the body of the stern Loyalist swayed in the saddle for an instant, then pitched headlong to the ground, as a line of light blue smoke was observed floating along the grave-yard wall. Startled by the report, the attention of the Quaker was instantly drawn to the quarter from whence it proceeded. At the same instant that he heard the quick and jarring sound, he beheld the body of Major Tracy falling heavily to the earth, and the wreaths of pale, blue smoke curling in the air above the grave-yard wall. Unheeding the shriek that arose from the lips of Marian at the sight, or the yell of horror uttered by the negro, Joab Smiley gave the rein to his horse, and reached the spot where the major fell the very moment he had measured his length upon the ground. Joab sprang from his horse, and in an instant the head of Major Tracy rested upon his knee. It needed not a second glance to tell the Quaker that he held a lifeless corse in his arms. The body rested in his embrace with the dull leaden weight of death, the face was pale as ashes, the dark eyes bursting from their sockets, glared upon the blue heavens with a cold glassy stare, and the nerves of the face, along the cheek, and around the mouth, were starting from the skin, with the electric throe of sudden death. The silver star, which he wore upon his left breast, was crimsoned by the current of blood flowing from the wound near the heart. Laying the body hurriedly upon the earth, the Quaker sprang over the wall of the grave-yard, and as he alighted upon the rising mound of a new made grave, he beheld the figure of a man, clad in rustic attire, disappearing among the shrubbery that overlooked the rear wall of the grave-yard, and, as he vanished, Joab noted that he held a rifle in his hand. He pursued the retiring figure, but in vain; he had fled beyond all hopes of capture, and the Quaker returned sadly to the highway, where a group of villagers had gathered around the corse, and were looking carelessly on, while Marian held the head of the dead man in her arms, and the faithful negro servant unfastened his cravat, loosened his dress, threw water in his face, and used every means that his untaught fidelity suggested to restore his master to life. “Why seek ye not the murderer?” shouted the Quaker, throwing himself into the midst of the throng of villagers. “Do ye behold a man cut down in the very glow of life before your eyes, and yet stir not a hand to secure his slayer?” “Well, I minds my own business,” replied an uncouth looking villager, “I don't know but what I might tell who sent that bullet, but d'ye see, friend Broadbrim, this man (pointing to Major Tracy) is—is a—tory! D'ye mark me?” “Are you men?” cried Marian, glancing around the crowd, while her eyes swam in tears. “Are you men, and have you one feeling of mercy, or pity, or justice, or right, and can ye stand and see a fellow being bleeding to death before your eyes, and extend not a hand to his assistance? Shame on ye!” 7* “He was a tory!” cried a second villager. “Go look at Chew's house, and ask for pity!” “Look at the pits filled with true Americans!” exclaimed a third. “Go look at the pits dug in every field for a mile round, and then ask mercy for a tory!” “Why, my friends,” cried the Quaker, as his dark grey eye flashed with anger and honest indignation, “did ye mingle in the battle? Are ye so fond of the right cause, and yet struck not a blow in its behalf? Verily, my friends, it is my plain opinion that ye are a pack of pitiful dogs, whose bark is even more terrible than their bite! As the maiden saith, so say I—shame on ye, shame!” “You'd better not stick any of your hard names on me,” cried the ill looking villager advancing, “for all you are a Quaker, I might chance to strike you!” “Thee might friend, might thee?” cried the Quaker, as he approached the villager; “verily, friend, thee is of no use here; but, on the contrary, thee grows troublesome. A little musing among the tombs may do thee good!” As the Quaker spoke, he extended his sinewy arms, and seizing the villager by the shoulder, very quietly bore him along to the grave-yard wall, and then, with as much ease as may be imagined, sent him plunging over among the tombs with an impetus that tended materially to make this ardent Hater-of-Tories pray earnestly “that he might alight in a soft place.” With a bland smile on his face, without any signs of passion or emotion, the Quaker returned to the group, who first eyed his tall, robust form, and his Herculean proportions with a significant scrutiny, and then were content to vent their spleen in general curses, upon the whole race of Tories, Loyalists, and so forth. The sound of approaching hoofs ran along the village street, and the attention of the group was attracted toward two horsemen, who came galloping from the direction of Chew's House. “They are Continentals!” cried a villager, “Continental officers, bearin' a flag of truce to the British army! I wonder what mought their names be?” “I say, captin',” cried one of the horsemen to the other, “in the name o' th' Continental Congress, what does this crowd mean in front o' yonder grave-yard?” “Let us push forward and see,” was the reply, and in a moment their steeds were reined in beside the group, and the foremost horseman pushed through the throng and beheld the dead man. “Herbert Tracy!” exclaimed the Quaker with a start of surprise, but the words died on his tongue, for the son was gazing steadfastly and fixedly in the face of his father, and his chest heaved, and his frame shook with emotion, but no tear dimmed his eye. His grief was too deep for tears, his agitation too fearful for utterance. And as the sun went down on that 4th day of October, in the year of Grace 1777, there they clustered around the body of the dead man, as it lay in the highway of Germantown in front of the grave yard from which the assassin winged his bullet. There was Marian Waltham, bending on one knee, and supporting the corse in her arms; the tears were flooding her cheeks and sobs of unfeigned sorrow were heaving her bosom. There was the Quaker with his plain honest visage and his manly form; there was Harry Heft, the bluff soldier, with his face expressive of mingled curiosity and astonishment; there was honest Charles, the negro, weeping for his master; around were grouped the careless idlers of the village, and over the corse, in the centre of the throng, was the form of Herbert Tracy; his arms were folded, his eyes were down cast, his dark hair fell wildly back from his uncovered brow, and over each lineament of his face came the expression of unutterable wo that gnawed at his heart strings for years, and dwelt in his soul until his dying day. One thought was gathering over his soul, absorbing every other feeling, and crushing every sentiment of natural grief— “He is dead—the father that I loved! And his CURSE is on me!” CHAPTER LAST. THE RE-UNION.—THE EXILE.—THE MYSTERY. Autumn passed—winter, with its storms, was over, and spring again bloomed amid the groves and glades of the Wissahikon. The day was serene, the air balmy, and the earth glad with the verdure of the trees, the music of the free streams, and the perfume of wild flowers. Two young maidens of different stations in life, as might be seen by their attire, were seated upon the porch of the mansion upon the heights of the Wissahikon, and as they gazed abroad upon the face of nature, and drank in the wild delight of sky and forest and stream, while the fragrant air, was playing amid the tendrils of the wild vine that clomb along the pillars of the porch, they forgot that the house by which they were seated was desolate, that its occupants were scattered aboard, and the silence of its halls but rarely disturbed by the sounds of human speech. The light haired maiden glanced at her mourning robe, and she thought of those who slept in the church-yard; the sparkle of the ring on her finger met her eye, and then her mind was far away amid the scenes of battle, and her fancy wandered with him who battled in the ranks of war, and who fought against the gloom that was upon his soul. The dark haired maiden glanced at the blue sky, at the forest sweeping in all its verdure along the height of the opposite hill; she listened to the lulling music of the rippling stream, and then her thoughts were with the hardy soldier, whose frank bearing, and rustic manliness, had won the admiration and the affection of her young heart, in many a ramble under that blue sky amid those green shades, and beside the lulling murmur of the quiet stream. At a short distance from the porch, a tall and robust farmer was engaged in cleaning the walks of a small flower-garden, from the mass of weeds and wild grass accumulated by time and neglect. His plain Quaker coat, was resting on the pailing of the garden fence, and with his muscular arms unbared, the farmer plyed the spade with every mark of alacrity and vigor. Ever and anon he would pause in his employment, and turning his honest visage to the heavens, he gazed at the deep azure above, then at the forest around, and finally his glance would rest upon the forms of the maidens seated upon the porch, whom he regarded with a look of quiet complacency, that told of a mind sobered by experience, taking delight in the calm innocence, the guileless converse, and the ardent hopes of youth. A little further on, a shining faced negro, with his arms black as ebony, stripped to the elbow, was engaged in trailing a wild vine along an arbor, while his shrill clear whistle broke merrily upon the air, interspersed with snatches of ditties of every kind and order of poetical merit, which he usually wound up with the loud “Hah-a-whah!” peculiar to the Ethiopian race. “This spot is more pleasant to thee, Miss Marian,” exclaimed the black haired maiden, turning to her fair companion. “This spot is more pleasant to thee, Miss Marian, than the loneliness of the mansion on the Ridge Road—is't not Miss Waltham?” “A thousand feelings, dear Margorie, combine to make this scene one of the saddest as well as the loveliest I ever looked upon. I cannot turn my eye to a flower, a spear of grass, a shrub or a tree, without the vivid revival of the memory of the past. Old faces, and well remembered forms, swim in the air around me—voices that once awoke the echoes of these walls, again sound in my ears— friends dearly and fondly beloved, are once more around me—and all the wo, the sorrow and care of the world are forgotten”— “Has thee heard of Captain Tracy lately, Miss Marian?” “Yes, Marjorie. But his letters are sad and gloomy, and he seems to be warring a bitter contest with the dark remembrance of the past. He has not mingled with the scenes of battle since the affray of Chew's House, and the terrible event that so fearfully wound up a day of bloodshed and horror.” “'Twas a sad thing, the death of Major Tracy. How strange! That the assassin should never be discovered!” “A fearful mystery is around the whole affair, Marjorie. Who it was that fired the shot, whether the hand of the murderer was raised in revenge of a private wrong, or from mere partizan enmity, has never come to light. These are times of strife and turmoil—and all the sympathies that bind men together in times of peace, seemed sundered and broken apart.” “But tell me, Miss Marian, did thy letters speak of—of—Lieutenant Heft? Is he still with Captain Tracy?” “The captain is still by the side of the Commander-in-chief, though he mingles not in the strife of battle. His letters speak of Harry Heft in the kindest terms. His qualities of a free, open frankness, and a speech, perhaps somewhat too blunt and rugged, have proved beneficent to Herbert, and in the company of his honest friend, he finds a frequent relief from the sorrow that weighs upon his soul.” A gleam of pleasure brightened in Marjorie's black eye, and a warm glow flushed over her cheek. She was about to reply, when a loud shout broke from the negro “Chawls the Fust,” and he was seen dancing about the lawn in every variety of grotesque attitudes and fantastic postures, that his lively imagination suggested. “Why friend, thee is surely demented!” exclaimed the astonished Quaker. “Massa Smiley, Massa Smiley, d'ye hear dat ar' laugh? A regular haw-haw! Dat am Harry Heft's laff—sure's my name's Charles de Fust! Massa's comin' home! Lor bless us—gorra-mighty! Dat am a fac.” Marian and Marjorie started up from their seats; the Quaker leaped over the garden fence on to the lawn, and the whole party listened eagerly to the sounds of horses' hoofs, which came echoing through the woods from the road among the rocks of the precipice. In a few moments all doubt was at an end and two horsemen emerged from the woods and rode over the lawn, at the top of their horses' speed. In an instant Marian was clasped in the arms of her lover, while Harry Heft, unheeding the presence of the staid Quaker, was so very rude as to inflict sundry kisses upon the pouting lips of the black eyed Quakeress, and enfold her pretty figure in a succession of loving embraces. “Marian, Marian, my own beautiful Marian”— exclaimed Herbert, as he gazed upon the fair face of his betrothed, while her kindling blue eyes returned his fond and ardent gaze. “Marian, we shall never part more. I have returned again to the scenes of our earliest love, to scenes hallowed by memory, though darkened by many a bitter sorrow; I will gaze once more upon the green woods and quiet shades of the Wissahikon and then leave these hills and vales for ever. Marian, will you share the fate of a wanderer and an exile?” It needed not the whispered words that came from the maiden's lip, to tell Herbert that he was still beloved. The maiden's beaming eye and blushing cheek, spoke the thoughts that were fluttering around her heart. “Marian,” whispered Herbert, “our love has been nursed in scenes of joy, it has grown and flourished amid scenes of trial and wo, and now, alone as we are in the wide and callous world, we will be all in all to each other—we will forget in foreign lands that ever our path was shadowed by a single cloud.” “Why Marjorie, you minx”—interrupted Harry Heft—“how pretty you've grown! How your dark eyes twinkle—how your rosy lips open with sich a han'some pout, as though you were good lookin' and you knew it. No, no, Marjorie— there's no use o' poutin' your lips and shakin' your head. We'll be married—that's certain! See— how uncle is shakin' his sides with quiet joy there! We'll be married for all I ain't a Quaker, and I'll away to the wars, and fight many a hard blow for my country yet, though the Rangers, and Dennis and all—God help me!—are dead and gone. And I'll come back a live man, I promise you, Marjorie, and we'll be married right off for certain. We will, by the Continental Congress!” It was the last time Herbert and Marian should gaze upon the wilds of the Wissahikon. The blue sky was above, the forest were around, the old mansion with its closed doors and fastened shutters, was sleeping in the sunlight. The arms of Herbert were entwined around Marian's waist; her face upturned to his countenance, seared by the lines of premature sorrow, glowed with the happiness of the hour, and her bosom heaved and her eyes swam in tears of joy. A little apart stood the manly Harry Heft beside the blushing Marjorie; in the back ground was the negro, dancing for gladness at the joy of others; and in the centre of the group stood the Quaker, Joab Smiley, his honest visage heightening with unfeigned pleasure as he regarded the love and happiness beaming from the faces of all around him. It was a scene of quiet joy, and one that dwelt in the remembrance of those who shared the felicity of the moment through the long lapse of future years. Herbert, entrusted with a mission of the utmost importance to his country, departed with his blooming bride to the gay scenes of the French metropolis, where he remained until the American war was terminated by the peace of Versailles. Lieutenant Wellwood Tracy, promotod to a Colonelcy, left America for England, and then sailed for India, where his love of pleasure and dissipation soon supplied him with that narrowest and quietest of all habitations—a grave. Harry Heft and the black-eyed Quakeress passed the quiet and peaceful years of their rustic felicity amid the shades of the Wissahikon, and long after the fresh-grown turf, extending greenly along the lawn of Chew's Mansion, had concealed all marks of blood and carnage, the blunt soldier and his pretty wife still lived to tell the story of the 4th of October, 1777—Harry to describe the scenes of the battle, the charge, the havoc and the retreat, and Marjorie to picture the fear and consternation that spread through the habitations of the village on that eventful day. Herbert Arnheim Tracy became known in foreign lands, as an able counsellor in the cabinet of kings, and tradition relates that after the lapse of years had borne his fair and beautiful wife from earth and its sorrows, a warrior whose brow was seared by the lines of premature age, was known among the bravest of the brave men who drew their swords under the banner of Napoleon, and shared in the carnage at Waterloo, by the title of General Arnheim de Tracy, designated by courtesy Monsieur Le Compte de La Wallingford, rather in respect to his ancient lineage, than from any actual possession of the estates of Wallingford, which finally, for want of a claimant, reverted to the British Crown. And the murderer of Major Tracy —was he ever discovered? The hand that pealed the shot from the graveyard wall of Germantown, was never recognised with all the accuracy and minute detail of circumstantial evidence. But tradition relates, that years after the battle, when the mansion of Major Tracy had passed into other hands, and events of the Revolution had assumed the venerable appearance of antiquity, an aged man, whose frame was broken down with disease, and whose brow was furrowed with the traces of long indulged passions, appeared in the village of Germantown, and sought the shelter of the village poor-house. In his dying hour, he muttered a dark confession of a life of crime and infamy, but the ears of his hearers were in especial attracted by a tale of horror, which he told of the evening succeeding the battle-morn. Returning from the plunder of the dead bodies that strewed the battle-field, he sought the shelter of the grave-yard wall, to examine his ill-gotten acquisitions. While thus employed, he observed approaching along the main road, an officer whom he had seen as he prowled from army to army during the day, prominent in the van of the British hosts, heading the charge, and fighting in the thickest of the melee. Seized by an uncontrolable impulse, the vagabond raised his piece to the level of the wall, and taking secure aim at the star on his breast, he shot the British officer to the heart and then fled. He knew not why he dealt the blow, but attributed the action to a sudden feeling to shed blood, that possessed him for the moment, together with a dimly defined desire to revenge the death of the Americans who strewed the battle-field. He made this confession and died, but still a thousand other legends exist with regard to the matter, and point out a thousand other causes of Major Tracy's death. How Major Tracy died, and when and where, was ever a matter of deep remembrance to his son, but that he died with the curse unrevoked and the imprecation unrecalled—that thought harrowed the mind of Herbert Tracy until his dying hour, and hung like a cloud of evil omen over the brightest points of the pathway of life. And so ends the legend of Herbert Tracy and his gallant band of Rangers, with all its wild and thrilling incidents, which are too much interwoven with truth and fact, to admit of the “unity and oneness,” that gives interest and attraction to a story purely fictionary in incident and character. The bones of Herbert Tracy whiten a foreign soil; his bride, his fair and youthful bride rests far from the friends, the valley of her childhood; a lowly mound in a village grave-yard contains the remains of the bluff Harry Heft and his dark-eyed dame, and after a lapse of sixty-five long years, the memory of the Battle has become a record of solemn and painful history; yet still around the homes of Germantown, and among the firesides of the quiet Wissahikon, lingers and lives the Legend of the Black Rangers.</field>
