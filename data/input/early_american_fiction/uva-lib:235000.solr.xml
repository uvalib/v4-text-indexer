      <field name="fulltext">TO GEORGE MACARTNEY BUSHE, M.D., AS A SMALL, THOUGH SINCERE, TESTIMONY OF GRATITUDE FOR HIS DISINTERESTED KINDNESS, AND FOR THE INESTIMABLE BENEFITS DERIVED FROM HIS PROFESSIONAL SKILL, THIS NOVEL IS AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED, BY HIS OBLIGED AND FAITHFUL FRIEND, THE AUTHOR. The above lines were written a short time before the day when, in accordance to the hidden workings of that Providence which it is not for man to comprehend or question, the great and glorious intellect to which they are addressed was fatally cut off from its mature career of usefulness, benevolence, and wisdom. It seems, however, to the writer, that the deplorable event which has deprived so many homes of their protector and their friend has but increased the fitness of this humble tribute; since, now that memory and grief are only left to us, it is admissible to speak aloud of those pre-eminent endowments which, while the owner lived, must have been tacitly recorded in his name alone. New-York, June 12, 1837.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK I. “Not to the imbattled field Shall the achievements of the peaceful gown The green immortal crown Of valour, or the songs of conquest yield. Not Fairfax wildly bold, While bare of crest he hew'd his fatal way Through Nasehy's firm array, To heavier dangers did his breast oppose Than Pym's free virtue chose When the proud force of Strafford he controll'd.” Akenside. CHAPTER I. “Can this be HE— That hath no privilege of gentle birth, Beauty, nor grace, nor utterance sublime Of words persuasive, nor the blood-bought skill That wins i' the foughten field?” “But even as you will, fair sir—even as you will! Though, an' you ride for Huntingdon this night, and wish not, ere it be two hours the later, that you had tarried here at the White Dragon, then am not I called Walter Danforth, nor have I drawn good ale in Royston these forty years and better.” With this prophetic sentence did the lord of cup and can wind up a long narration of roads impassable, and bridges broken, and “all the moving accidents of flood and field,” with which, according to time-honoured usage among the heroes of the spigot, he was endeavouring to beguile the lated wayfarer. In the present instance, however, it would seem that the ominous warnings of the worthy Boniface were destined to be of none effect, for with a cheery smile the traveller answered— “'Tis like enough, good host of mine—'tis like enough—so all the cates of the White Dragon vie with this puissant Bourdeaux;” and, as he spoke, he proffered to the landlord's grasp the mighty flagon of bright pewter, which, despite his eulogy, he had left still mantling with its generous liquor,—“but, were the venture deeper, I must on to-night; and, in good sooth, too often have I jour neyed through the midnight passes of the wild Abruzzi, and the yet wilder Pyrenean hills of Spain, to ponder gravely on a late ride or a sprinkled doublet among these chalky wolds of Hertford shire.” “Ay! were that all—” returned the other, heaving a long breath after the potent draught with which he had exhausted the flagon, and eying wistfully the coins which had dropped with so sweet a jingle into his greasy palm,—“Ay, were that all—but there are worse customers on Ermine-street than darkness, or storm either, though the clouds be mustering so black in the west yonder, over the woods of Potton. Wise men ride not forth nowadays an hour after sundown, nor earlier, save in company.” “Then must Old England be sore changed since last I left her,” replied the traveller, a shade of thought or sorrow, for it might be either, crossing his features, and not entirely effaced by the frank smile which followed it. “And if she be—” he paused, unwilling, as brave men ever are, to utter sentiments which might, however justified by the occasion, sound boastfully. “And if she be?” inquired the interested Walter, seeing that his guest hesitated to complete his sentence, “and if she be sore changed?” “Why, then hath brown Bess borne me though worse frays than I am like to meet, I trow, on this side Huntingdon; nor will it be small peril that shall arrest her now; and so good e'en, fair landlord.” “A bold bird and a braggart!” muttered the disconcerted publican, as the horseman, giving the spur to the highbred mare of which he had just spoken, rode briskly off. “But if he meet with those I wot of, he may yet crow craven.” Who those were to whom his words so pointedly alluded, is not perhaps a question of more than ordinary moment, unless it be from the vast conception of their prowess which appears to have been entertained by the landlord of the White Dragon; for, in truth, the gentleman who had earned his ill-will merely by a natural reluctance to tarry in Royston when his occasions called him elsewhere, was of very different mould from one of whom it would be said that he was like to fall an easy or unresisting prey to any who should dare dispute his progress. Removed alike from the greenness of inconsiderate youth and from the inactivity of an advanced age, the rider might be looked upon as exhibiting a specimen of manhood, in the full vigour of its endowments, both mental and corporeal, as fair as is permitted by the imperfections of humanity. Considerably above the ordinary height of men, broad-shouldered, deep-chested, and thin-flanked, he sat his charger with an ease and firmness resulting more from natural grace and flexibility of limb than from the practised art of the manége. His eye was clear and even quick, though thought and calmness seemed to belong, rather than energy or fire, to its general expression,—qualities belied neither by the broad imaginative forehead, nor by the firm and slightly compressed outline of his chiselled lips. He wore a small mustache, but neither beard nor whiskers, although both these were common in the last years of the unhappy monarch who at that time swayed the destinies of England. His hair, as was the wont among the higher classes of society, flowed in loose curls, trained with peculiar care, far down the neck and over the collar of the doublet, while a single ringlet, longer and more assiduously cherished than the rest, seemed to indicate that the wearer was not of one mind with the pamphlet lately published by the notorious Master Prynne on the “unloveliness of love-locks.” The dress of this cavalier, a loose velvet jerkin of that peculiar shade which, from being the favourite colour of the greatest painter of his day, has been dignified with the immortal title of Vandyke, was slashed and broidered with black lace and satin; tight breeches of buff leather, guarded with tawny silk, high boots, and massive spurs, completed his attire; all save a broad-leafed hat of dark gray beaver, with one black ostrich feather drooping from the clasp which held it over the left eyebrow. His military cloak of sable cloth and velvet was buckled to the croup of his war-saddle, while from beneath the housings of the bow peered out the heavy pistols, which had not long before supplanted the lance as the peculiar weapon of the horseman. A long rapier, with its steel scabbard and basket-hilt of silver delicately carved, hung from a shoulder-scarf of the same colour with his doublet, matched by a poniard of yet more costly fabric in his Cordovan leather girdle. When it is added that the mare which he had styled “brown Bess” was an animal that might be pronounced unrivalled for the rare union she displayed of strength and beauty, of English bone and high Arabian blood—the latter manifested in the clean limb, full eye, and coat glancing like polished copper to the sunlight—naught will be wanting to the picture of the traveller who was now journeying right onward, undismayed, if not incredulous of all that he had heard, across the bleak and barren hills which skirt the southern verge of Cambridgeshire. Vol. I.—B The season was that usually the most delicious of the English year—the bright and golden days of early autumn—when the promises of spring and summer are fulfilled in the rustling harvest-field and the rich orchard, and before the thoughts of change, decay, and death are forced upon the mind by the sere leaf and withered herbage. The day had been mild and calm, and, though evening was far advanced, the sun was still shooting his slant rays over the rounded summits and grassy slopes of the low hills through which the ancient Roman way holds its undeviating course. Ere long, however, the clouds of which the landlord had spoken as gathering so darkly to the westward, though at that time visible only in a narrow streak along the edge of the horizon, began to rise in towering masses, until the light of the declining day-god was first changed to a dark and lurid crimson, and then wholly intercepted. After a while the wind, which had been slight and southerly, veered round and blew in fitful squalls, now whirling the dust and stubble high into the air, and again subsiding into a stillness that from the contrast seemed unnatural. Such was the aspect of the night when the sun set, and the little light which had hitherto struggled through intervals of the increasing storm-cloud, waned rapidly to almost utter darkness. To render the traveller's position yet less enviable, he had already passed the open country, and was now involved in the mazes of scattered woodland, which in the seventeenth century overspread so large a portion of that country. The way too, which had thus far been firm and in good order, now running between deep hollow banks, resembled rather a water-course deserted by its torrent than a public throughfare; so that his progress was both slow and painful until he reached the banks of the Cam—at that place, as throughout much of its course, a strong and turbid stream, wheeling along in sullen eddies between shores of soft black loam. Here daylight utterly deserted him, its last glimpse barely sufficing to show that the bridge had been carried away, and that the river was apparently unfordable; since a miry track wandered away from the brink to the left hand; as though in search of a place where it might pass the current, and resume its natural direction to the northward. While he was considering what course it would be most advisable that he should pursue, a few large heavy drops of rain plashed on the surface of the gloomy stream, warning the stranger to hasten his decision. Then, as he turned to follow, as best he might, the devious and uncertain path before him, the windows of the heavens were opened, and down came the thick shower, pattering on the thirsty earth, and lashing the river's bosom into a sheet of whitened spray. Thoroughly drenched, and almost hopeless of recovering the true direction of his journey until the return of daylight, it was yet not a part of that man's character to hesitate, much less to falter or despair. Having once determined what it would be for the best to do, he went right onward to his purpose, though it oftentimes required the full exercise of spur and rein to force the gallant animal which he bestrode against the furious gusts and pelting storm. For a weary hour or more he plodded onward, feeling his way, as it were, step by step, and guided only by the flashes of broad lightning which from time to time glared over the desolate scene, with an intensity that merely served to render the succeeding gloom more dreary. At length, by the same wild illumination, he discovered that his path once more turned northward, sinking abruptly to the verge of that black river. Of the farther bank he could distinguish nothing; and though for many minutes he awaited the return of the electric light before attempting to stem the unknown ford, with that singular perversity which even things inanimate and senseless at times seem to exhibit, the flashes returned no more. Still no word of impatience or profanity rose to his lip, as he spurred the reluctant mare resolutely down the steep descent, holding his pistols, which he had drawn from their holsters, high above his head. At the first plunge, as he had well expected, all foot-hold was lost, and nothing remained but a perilous swim, not without considerable risk of finding an impracticable bank at the farther side; but whether it was the result of skill or of fortune, or, more probable than either, a combination of the two, after a few rough struggles and a scramble through the tenacious mire, horse and man stood in safety on the northern verge. Not yet, however, could the adventures of that night be deemed at an end; for, having once deviated from it during the hours of darkness, it was no easy matter to recover the line of the high road. The storm, it is true, after a while abated; and the by-path into which he struck was sufficiently hard to enable the cavalier to travel at a pace more rapid than he had tried since quitting Royston; but notwithstanding this, so much time had been lost, and so small did the prospect seem of reaching his destination, or indeed any other village at which to pass the night, that the merciful rider was beginning to occupy himself in searching for such temporary shelter as a cattleshed, or the lee-side of some lonely haystack might afford, when his eye was attracted by a distant light—now seen, now lost among the young plantations, or scattered stripes of forest which checkered everywhere the scenery. It required but a moment's pause to discover that the light was in motion, and at a smaller distance than he had at first conjectured; and though there might have been grounds for suspicion and distrust to the weak or timid in the place and manner of its appearance, quickening his pace to a gallop, and somewhat altering his course, he rode straight for the object. Five minutes brought him to a bank and ditch, evidently skirting the road of which he was in quest; the clatter of the horse's hoofs as he leaped the trifling obstacle, and landed safely on the rough pavement of the Roman way, was, it should seem, the first intimation of his approach that reached the bearers of the light; for ere he could distinguish more than the figures of two or three rude-looking countrymen, one of them bearing on his shoulders what resembled the carcass of a deer, it was either extinguished altogether or suddenly veiled from sight. “They are upon us,” cried a hoarse voice, “shoot, Wilkin!” and instantly the clang of a steel crossbow, and the whistle of the heavy bolt, as it narrowly missed the rider's ear, showed that the mandate was complied with as promptly as delivered. “Hold! hold your hands!” he shouted, “or ye will fare the worse. Ye know me not, nor care I aught for ye.” “Fare the worse, shall we?” interrupted the other,—“that shall we see anon. Come on, brave boys, and down with this proud meddler!” and with a loud fierce cry, some six or seven ruffians, as he judged from the sound of their footsteps, rushed against him. In the moment which had elapsed since the first outrage, he had prepared his weapons, and was already on his guard; but it was not destined that he should this time need their service; B 2 for just as he reined up his steed, and parried the first blow aimed at him with a crowbar or a quarterstaff, the quick tramp of coming horsemen was heard upon the road behind him; and with their swords drawn, as if excited by the shout of the ruffians, two or three persons galloped rapidly to his assistance. “What knaves be these?” inquired a loud and dissonant voice from the foremost of the new-comers, as the cavalier fell back toward his welcome rescuers. “What knaves be these that raise this coil on the highway?” “Down with the thieving Girgashites!” shouted another of the riders, ere an answer could be rendered to the querist; and, at the word, he fired a petronel at random, its momentary flash displaying the marauders struggling, as best they might, through a strong blackthorn fence, which parted the road from a wild tract of coppice, glade, and woodland. “Deer-stealers, Master Oliver,” he continued, reslinging his now useless weapon, “after the herds of my Lord De la Warr. But I have scared them for the nonce!” “More shame to thee, Giles Overton,” cried the same voice which had first spoken, “and more sin likewise, to use the carnal weapon thus in causeless strife; setting the precious spirit of a being like to, or it may well be better than thyself, upon the darkling venture of chance-medley, and bartering a human life against the slaughter of a valueless and soulless beast. Go to, Giles Overton, see that thou err not in the like sort again! But art thou hurt, good sir?” proceeded the speaker, turning in his saddle toward the traveller, for whose safety he had come up so opportunely,—“or have we, by the mercy of the Lord, who may in this— if it be not presumptuous in me, considering how unprofitable I am, and the mean improvement of my talent, so to judge of his workings—vouchsafe to preserve thee for a chosen vessel. Have we, I would say, come in season to protect thee from these sons of Ammon?” “Thanks to your timely aid, fair sir,” replied the cavalier, not a little astonished at the strange address of his preserver; for he had but recently returned to his native land after protracted absence, and, at the time of his departure, the reign of the saints had not yet commenced on earth—“I am uninjured; and now, I pray you to increase yet farther this your kindness, by informing me the straightest road for Huntingdon; it cannot be, I do suppose, far distant.” “Good lack—a stranger, by your questioning,” answered he who had been called Oliver; “Huntingdon do I know right well—ay! even as one knoweth the tabernacle of his abode, and the burial-place of his fathers; but I profess to you that it is distant by full thirteen miles, and those of sorry road. But ride thou on with me to Bourne, some three miles farther, and I will bestow thee at a house where thou mayst tarry until morn—the Fox Tavern, I would say—Phineas Goodenough, my glove hath fallen; I pray thee reach it to me— a clean house, truly, kept by a worthy man—yea, verily, a good man, one that dwelleth in the fear of the Lord alway.” “A stranger am I doubtless,” returned the other, “else had I not inquired of thee that which I then had well known; and, of a truth, I know not now that I can do aught better than to accept your proffer frankly as it is made!” “Be it so!” was the ready answer. “Will it please you to ride somewhat briskly; for myself, I am bound an hour's ride farther to worshipful Master Pym's, nigh Caldecote!” “Ha! Pym, the friend of Hampden and John Milton—I knew not he lived hereabout,” exclaimed the cavalier. “And what knowest thou, so I may ask it,” queried Oliver, “of Hampden or John Milton? Truly, I took thee for a carnal-minded person; but, of a surety, it is not for a man to judge!” “For what it liked your wisdom to mistake me, I know not; nor, to speak frankly, do I care greatly,” replied the other; “but, to satisfy your question, of Hampden I know nothing, save that the mode of his resistance to that illegal claim of ship-money hath reached my ears, even where the tongue of England would have sounded strangely. John Milton, if it concerns you any thing to hear of him, was, and that too for many months, my chosen comrade of the road, and my most eloquent tutorer in the classic lore of Italy!” “In Italy, saidst thou? In Italy, and with John Milton?” answered Oliver, after a long and meditative pause; and, as he continued, his own voice had lost much of its harshness, and his manner not a little of its offensive peculiarity. “A better comrade couldst thou not have chosen than that pure-minded Christian, that most zealous patriot. Verily, I say to you, that, in consorting with that sanctified, elected vessel, you must needs have imbibed some draughts more worthy than the profane and carnal lore of those benighted heathens, whose bestial and idolatrous rites are even now to be found corrupting with their accursed stench the faith which claims to be of Jesus, even as the stinking fly poisoneth the salve of the mediciner. Verily I will believe that he hath opened unto you the door of that wisdom which is alone all in all! Ay! and as I find you here returning hard upon his heels, even as he hath of late returned from the city of her that sitteth on the seven hills, clothed in the purple of the harlot, may I not humbly hope—I would say—confidently trust, that you will also draw the sword of truth to defend this sore-aggrieved and spirit-broken people from the tyrannous oppression of their rulers, and the self-seeking idolatries of those that sit in the high places of the land!” “Fair sir,” replied the cavalier, “you question somewhat too closely; and converse, methinks, too freely for a stranger. That I come, summoned homeward by the rumour of these unhappy broils between our sovereign and his parliament, is not less true than that I care not either to conceal or to deny it! Beyond this—what part soever I may play in that which is to come—pardon my plainness, sir, I do not deem it wisdom to discourse with a chance customer. Nor have I yet indeed decided what that part shall be, until I search more narrowly the grounds, and so find out my way 'twixt over license on the one hand, and, as it seems to me, intemperance on the other, and too fiery zeal!” “Edgar Ardenne,” returned the puritan, his naturally harsh voice subsiding into a hollow croak, “Edgar Ardenne—for I do know you, though, as you have truly spoken me, a stranger— I tell you now, this nation totters on the brink of a most strange and perilous convulsion! We are the instruments—vile instruments, it is true, but still instruments—in the hands of Him who holds the end of all things. Watched have we, and prayed; yea, wrestled with him in the spirit for a sign, and lo! a sign was sent us. It may be we shall achieve deliverance for our country—freedom from corporeal chains and spiritual bondage! It may be we shall fail, and, failing, seek the shelter of that New Jerusalem beyond the Western Ocean, wherein there be no kings to lord it o'er men's consciences, and to compel them how to worship God! But fail we, or succeed, the sign hath been given to us from on high, and therefore shall we venture! and fail we, or succeed—mark my words, Edgar Ardenne, for thou shalt think on them hereafter—thy lot is cast with ours! Thy spirit is of our order, thy heart is with us, and thy tongue shall be, yea, and thy sword likewise!” “How you have learned my name, I comprehend not,” answered Ardenne, for so must he be styled henceforth, veiling whatever of suspicion or annoyance he might feel beneath the semblance of a cold and dignified indifference; “but, were it worth the while, I could assure you that, in learning this, you have learned all! What part you play in this wild drama,—whether you be hypocrite or zealot, patriot or traitor, I care nothing; but, if we meet hereafter, you will learn that neither sophistry nor canting can affect my head, nor the dark phrensy of fanaticism reach my heart!” “We shall meet,” answered the stranger; “we shall meet again, and shortly! and then shall you too learn if I be saint or hypocrite—if I be patriot or traitor!—and, above all, then shall you learn if, in these things that I have spoken, I be a lying prophet or a true! But lo you now—this is the Fox at Bourne, and here comes honest Langton, to whose good offices I do commit you!” As he spoke, they drew up their horses before the door of the little wayside hostelry, a low and whitewashed tenement, imbosomed in deep woodlands, and nestling, as it were, amid the verdant foliage of jessamine and woodbine; while, warned already of their coming by the clatter of hoofs and the sound of voices, the puritanic person of mine host, bearing on high a huge and smoky flambeau, which poured its red light far into the bosom of the darkness, stalked forth to meet them. On his lean and starveling form, however, Ardenne cast but a passing glance, being employed in serutinizing, by the wild illumination which streamed full upon them, the features of his singular companion; who had paused for a moment to allow his horse to drink, and to hold a whispered conversation with the landlord. There was, however, nothing familiar to him, though he probed his memory to its lowest depth of youthful recollections, in that manly yet ungraceful figure, or in those lineaments, harsh and ill-favoured to the verge of downright ugliness. Ill-favoured was that countenance indeed, with its deeply-furrowed lines and its sanguineous colouring; its sunken eyes, twinkling below the penthouse of the heavy matted brows; and its nose, prominent, rubicund, and swollen. Yet was there a world of thought in the expansive temples and the massive forehead—an expression of firmness that might restrain an empire in the downward curve of the bold mouth—and a general air of high authority and of indomitable resolution pervading the whole aspect of the man. The head of this remarkable-looking individual, at a period when the greatest attention was lavished on the hair by all of gentle birth, was covered with coarse locks, already streaked with gray, falling in long disordered masses on either cheek, and down the muscular short neck, from underneath a rusty beaver, steeple-crowned and unadorned by feather, loop, or tassel. Instead of the cravat of Flanders lace, he wore a narrow band of soiled and rumpled linen; and his sword, a heavy iron-hilted tuck, was not suspended from a scarf or shoulderknot, but girt about his middle, over a doublet of black serge, by a belt of calf-skin leather, corresponding to the material of his riding-boots, which were pulled up above the knee to meet the loose trunk hose, fashioned, as it would be supposed, by some ill country tailor from the same unseemly stuff with his cloak and doublet. The only part of his appointments which would not have disgraced the commonest gentleman was his horse, a tall gray gelding of great power and not a little breeding; yet even he was badly accoutred with mean and sordid housings. Such was the appearance of the person whose conversation had not been listened to by Edgar Ardenne without deep interest; and now—even while he confessed to himself that the man's frame and features entitled him to no regard as a person of superior caste or bearing— there was still something in his air which produced an indescribable effect on the mind of the cavalier, forcing him, as it were, despite his senses, to admit that he was in somewise remarkable, above, and at the same time apart from, ordinary mortals, and not unlike to one who might be indeed the mover of great changes in the estate of nations. While he was yet gazing on him with ill-dissembled curiosity, the stranger, in his loud hoarse notes, bade him adieu, and, striking at once into a rapid trot, was swallowed up with his companions in the surrounding gloom. Edgar, after a fruitless effort at ascertaining from the saintly and abstracted publican the name and quality of his late companion, applied himself to creature comforts, as the landlord termed them, of a higher order, and to a bed more neatly garnished, than he could have augured from the lowly exterior of the village inn. CHAPTER II. “A gentle being, delicately fair, Full of soft fancies, timorous, and shy; Yet high of purpose, and of soul so firm, That sooner shall you the round world unsphere, Than warp her from the conscious path of right. A bright domestic goddess, formed to bless, And sooth, and succour—oh most meet to be The shrined idol of a heart like his.” Two days had elapsed, and the third was already drawing toward its close, since the encounter of the cavalier with his saintly ally; for the sun, scarce elevated thrice the breadth of his own disk above the horizon, was now almost perceptibly declining in the west, though he still darted long pencilled rays of light athwart the landscape from between the folds of gauze-like mist which veiled his splendours from the eye. One of these straggling beams—while others might be discerned shedding their bright intelligence upon some verdant slope or twinkling waterfall, thus rescued, although miles away, from the hazy indistinctness that steeped the distant hills, and rendered prominent, like epochs marked by fame amid the gloom of ages else forgotten—one of these straggling beams had found its way into a nook as sweet as ever poet sung or fairy haunted. It was an angle in one of those broad green lanes which form so beautiful a feature in the rural scenery of England. Carpeted with deep unfaded verdure, through which meandered a faint wheel-track; bordered by hedges so thick and tangled as to resemble natural coppices rather than artificial fences; imbowered Vol. I.—C by the fragrant honeysuckle, and spangled with the dewy flowers of the yet sweeter eglantine; decked with the golden blossoms of the broom, the fringe-like brachens, and the flaunting bells of the white and crimson fox-gloves; canopied by the dense umbrage of the broad-leaved sycamore, the gnarled and ivy-mantled oak, or the lighter and more graceful ash; and watered by a tiny brooklet, that stole along, now on one side, now on the other, of the rarely-trodden path—here tinkling over its many-coloured pebbles with a mirthful music, there silently reflecting the tufted rushes and the mossy log that spanned its surface with a sylvan bridge— that solitary nook might well have furnished forth a tiring-room for Shakspeare's wild Titania. Nor, though the days of Puck and Oberon were already numbered with the things that had been, did that lone bower lack its presiding genius; for on a trunk, cushioned with hoary lichens, and overlooking a crystal basin formed by the rill which undermined its tortuous roots, and had, perchance, in bygone ages, caused its decay and ruin, there sat a female form, loveliest among the lovely, gazing, as at first sight it seemed, Narcissus-like, upon her watery image, but in truth so deeply buried in her own imaginings that she was no less ignorant of all she looked upon than was the senseless stump on which she leaned so gracefully. She was a girl perhaps of twenty summers; for, looking on her, it had been impossible to reckon save by summers, so sunny was the style of her young beauty. On either side of her white and dazzling forehead, ringlets in rich exuberance of the deepest auburn —so deep that, saving where they glittered gold-like in the sunshine, they might have been deemed black—fell off behind her ears and wantoned down her swan-like neck; while, in the luxury of calm abandonment, her velvet hat, dropped by her side, lay on the grass, its choice plumes ruffling the mirror of the pool. Her eyes were bent so steadfastly upon the waters at her feet, that it was by the long dark lashes only, pencilled in clear relief against the delicate complexion of her cheek, that they could be judged large, and suited to the character of her most eloquent features. Of an almost marble paleness, with scarce a rosy trace to tell of the pure blood which coursed so warmly through those thousand azure channels that veined her neck and bosom, there was yet a transparency, a glowing hue in her fair skin that spoke of all the lively elasticity of health; while, to remove a doubt, if doubt could have existed, the sweet curve of that small mouth, wooingly prominent, was tinged with the rich hue of the dark red carnation. Though Grecian in their chiselled outlines, there yet was more of intellect and energy in the expression of her features than of that poetical repose which forms the general character of the classic model. Her shape, as she reclined along her rustic couch, though of voluptuous roundness, was rather slight than full; and the ankle, displayed somewhat too liberally by the disordered draperies of her satin riding-dress, was slender as a sylphid's limb, while her dimpled chin was propped, in attitude of busy thought, on so diminutive a hand as would alone have proved her pedigree from the unconquered race of Normandy. Nor was the attitude belied by aught of consciousness or coquetry, for all betokened the deep hush of natural and unstudied meditation. A beautiful white palfrey, with decorated rein and velvet housings, which stood unfettered at her side, awaiting, docile and gentle creature, the pleasure of his mistress, would stamp and toss his head till the silver bits rang audibly, and uttered once or twice a tremulous impatient neigh, unheeded at the least, if not unheard. A vagrant spaniel of the Blenheim breed, with soft dark eyes, and ears that almost swept the ground—one from a number that had followed the fair girl, and now dozed listlessly upon the grass around her—had been for some time rustling among the dewy bushes, and now sent forth a shrill and clamorous yelping, as pheasant after pheasant whirred up on noisy wings into the higher branches, whence they crowed, with outstretched necks, defiance to their powerless assailant. Still there was no sign in the demeanour of the lady to indicate that she had marked the sounds, harmonizing as they did with the spirit of the place and hour, and blending naturally with the low of the distant cattle, the cawing of the homeward rooks, and the continuous hum of the myriad insect tribes which were still disporting themselves in the September sunset, not the less merrily that their little glass of life had already run even to its latest sands. But anon a noise arose, which, in itself by no means inharmonious, was not so much attuned to the rural melodies around but that it jarred discordantly on the ear. It was the clear and powerful voice of a man, venting his feelings as he rode along—for at times the tramp of a horse might be distinguished, when his hoof struck upon harder soil than common, mingling with the measured tones, as, perhaps unconscious of his occupation, the rider recited aloud such passages from the high poets of the day as were suggested to his memory by all that met his senses. At first the accents were indistinct from distance, and their import quite inaudible; then, as the speaker drew so nigh that his words might partially be understood, the voice ceased altogether; but after a brief pause it again broke forth in the pure poetry of Drummond. “Thrice happy he, who by some shady grove, Far from the clamorous world, doth live his own, Though solitary, who is not alone, But doth converse with that eternal love: O how more sweet is birds' harmonious moan, Or the hoarse sobbings of the widowed dove, Than those smooth whispers near a prince's throne, Which make good doubtful—” As the words passed his lips the horseman turned the last angle of the winding lane; and for the first time discovering that the free outpourings of his spirit had found a listener, Edgar Ardenne—for the moralist was no other—paused in his sonnet and checked his steed by a common impulse, and, as it seemed, a single movement. His eyes flashed joyfully as they met the large and violet-coloured orbs which the fair girl had raised at first in simple wonderment, but which now lightened with a gleamy radiance that he was not slow to construe into delighted recognition. “Sibyl—sweet Sibyl!—” “Edgar, can it indeed be you? Welcome, oh welcome home!” At once, without a moment's interval, the words burst forth from either as they hastened—he with impetuous hurry from his charger, she gathering her ruffled robes about her, and rising from her rustic throne with the unblushing ease of conscious modesty—to manifest their pleasure at this unexpected meeting. Were they friends; or kindred, or more dearly linked than either by the young ties of holy, unsuspicious, and unselfish love? They met; the formal fashions of the day would scarcely have allowed the gallant to fold even a sister to his bosom; Edgar clasped her not, therefore, in the arms that evidently yearned to do so; but with a polished ease, belied by the flushed brow and frame that quivered visibly with eagerness, himself ungloving, he raised her white hand to his lips, which C 2 dwelt upon it even too fervently for brotherly affection. A deep blush, glowing the more remarkably from its contrast to her wonted paleness, over brow and cheek, and visible, though with a fainter hue, even upon her neck and such brief portion of the bosom as might be descried between the fringes of rich lace that edged her bodice, she yet expressed not aught of wonder or of reluctance to his familiar greeting. Though the small hand trembled in his grasp with a perceptible and quick emotion, it was not withdrawn; nor, while he gazed upon those eloquent eyes as steadfastly as though through them he would have read the inmost feelings of the soul that so informed them, did she shrink from his evident though chastened admiration. A moment or two passed ere either again spoke; it might be that their passionate feelings were better to be interpreted from silence than expressed by words—it might be that their hearts were full to overflowing, and that so they dared not to unlock those secret channels lest they might be led—he into such betrayal of his feelings as is deemed weak and womanish by the great mass of men, themselves too calculating or too cold to feel at all—she into such disclosure of her soul's treasured secret as oftentimes is censured, and not perhaps unjustly, as at the least impolitic, if not immodest or unmaidenly. It was, however, Sibyl who, with the delicate and ready tact peculiar to her sex, first broke the silence, which had endured so long already as to become almost embarrassing; and as she spoke, her words explained their relative position, although it might even then be doubted whether the full extent of their connexion was as yet divulged. “I can hardly,” she said, in those low and musical notes which are indeed an excellent thing in woman—“I can hardly trust my eyes, dear cousin, when they tell me, truant as you are and traitor, that you stand bodily before me. So long have our hearts been rendered sick by hope deferred— so often have we gazed, from peep of morn till the sad close of evening, for your expected, for your promised coming, and gazed but to be disappointed—that now, when you have truly come, we had ceased, not to hope, indeed, and pray, but surely to expect.” “Oh, Sibyl, did you know how many an anxious thought, how many a bitter pang these wearisome delays have cost me, you would pity rather than upbraid.” “Fair words, good cousin Edgar,” she replied, with an arch glance, and a light thrilling laugh; “fair words, and flowery all! and with such, you lords of the creation, as in your vanity you style yourselves, deem you can wipe away the heaviest score of broken vows and perjured promises from the frail memories of easy and deluded damsels. But, in good sooth, I marvel not that you should slight poor me, when you have questioned nothing, and that too after a three years' absence, of your noble father; and when you stand here dallying within a scant mile of his presence, rounding your false excuses into a credulous lady's ear. For shame, sir! for my part, if I felt it not, then would I feign at least some natural affection.” “Wild as thou ever wert, fair Sibyl,” answered Edgar, a beautiful smile playing over his grave features, and revealing a set of teeth even and white as ivory; “I hoped, when I beheld you so pensive and so melancholy, musing beside yon lonely pool, that years growing toward maturity might have brought something of reflection to tame those girlish spirits—but, in good faith, I should have known you better. But am I not assured, were it but by your being here so blithe and beautiful, that all goes well at home?” “Well parried, if not honestly,” still laughing she replied; “and for your taunts on my demeanour, I defy you! But help me to my horse, sir loiterer, and we will homeward; for I do believe, despite your manifold enormities, that you would fain see those who, to your shame be it spoken, will feel more joy to greet you, than you have shown alacrity to do so much as ask of their well-being. I warrant me, if you had met Sir Henry first, you had not once inquired whether poor I were in existence.” In another moment the lady was mounted on her white palfrey, and, with the cavalier beside her bridle-rein, rode toward her home more joyously than she had done for many a month before. Not, however, in loud mirth, nor even in the sprightly raillery which she had adopted on their first meeting, was her happiness divulged to common ears; but her soft eyes, dwelling fondly on the features long unseen of her accepted and acknowledged lover, though they were lowered modestly so often as they caught his answering glances—with the subdued and quiet tones of her melodious voice as they conversed of old home scenes and sweet familiar recollections, more endeared to them, all trivial as they were, than loftier memories—were confirmations strong as an angel's voice of her unchanged affection. After a short ride, rendered shorter yet to them by the enjoyment for so long a time unused, though not forgotten, of each other's converse; by the sweet consciousness of mutual love; and by the full expansion of their feelings, unrestrained by the cold formalities of that most heartless intercourse which men have styled society, and untrammelled by any chains save those instinctive bonds of pure and delicate propriety which noble natures ever wear about them in the guise of flowery garlands, gracing, while they dignify, the motions which they in no respect impede—after a short ride through the windings of that verdant lane—here rendered almost gloomy by the shadows of occasional woodlands which it traversed; here running past the door of some secluded cottage, its thatched porch overhung with bowering creepers, and its narrow garden gay with tall hollyhocks and ever-blooming peas; and here looking forth from intervals in the tall hedges over some sunny stubble-field, on which the golden shocks stood fair and frequent, or some deep pasture, its green surface dotted with sleek and comely cattle—they reached a rustic gate of unbarked timber, woven into fantastic shapes, and through it gained admittance into a demesne, as rich as ever was transmitted by its first winner of the bloody hand to a long line of undegenerate posterity. Even to the wandering and homeless stranger there is a calm and quiet joy in the stately solitude of an English park,—in its broad velvet lawns, sloping southwardly away, studded with noble clumps, or solitary trees more noble yet, down to the verge of some pellucid lake or brimful river,—in its swelling uplands, waving with broom and brachens— sweet haunt for the progeny of the timid doe— whence glitter frequently the white stems of the birch or the red berries of the mountain ash,—in the wild belling of the deer, heard from some rock-ribbed glen, where they have sheltered during the hot noontide,—in the cooing of the pigeon, or the repeated tap of the green woodpecker,—in the harsh cry of the startled heron, soaring on his broad vans from the sedgy pool before the intruder's footstep,—in the lazy limp of the pastured hares, and in the whirr of the rising covey. What then must be the feeling summoned by the same picture to the heart of one who hears in every rural sound, and witnesses in every sylvan scene, the melodies that soothed his earliest slumber, and the sights that nursed his youngest meditations? To him these stately solitudes are peopled with a thousand holy recollections; the step, perchance, of a departed mother still roams beneath those immemorial trees; her musical voice still speaks to his heart audibly, and in the very tones his childhood listened, when all its cares were hushed;—to him each bosky bourn and twilight dingle has its memory of boyish exploit, each chiming rill of boyish revery. Home—home—hackneyed as is the thought and time-worn—what a world of treasured sweetness is there in that one word Home! The humblest as the highest—in sorrow as in mirth—to the needy exile as to the successful adventurer—for ever dear, for ever holy. Crowded out perhaps from the selfish spirit by the bustle, the tumult, the conflict of the day—but still returning with undiminished force when the placid influence of night and slumber shall have stilled the fitful fever, and restored to the sullied heart, for one short hour, the purity it knew of yore. Oh! if there be on the broad face of earth the wretch that loves not, with an unquenchable and ever-living love, the native home—curse him not when ye meet, he is accursed already. Vindictive men have warred against, ambitious men have sacrificed, and sordid men have sold their countries; but these, ay, each and all of these, if we could read their souls, have had their moments of repentant thought, their moments of triumphant fondness. What then must be the feelings of a mind like that of Ardenne—a mind coupling the severe and disciplined philosophy of schools with the warm and wild romance of a poetic fancy—a mind which had learned wisdom without learning vice, amid the fierce pleasures and the fiercer strife of a licentious world—a mind no less unselfish than it was reasoning and regular— a mind, filled with the beautiful principles of that universal love, which is honour, and patriotism, and every shape of virtue—virtue, not cold in itself, as the wicked say, and chilling all things that it touches, but genial, and enlivening, and warm with every generous aspiration? What must have been the feelings of a man, endowed with such a mind, returning to his unforgotten home from years of restless wandering, in pursuit—not of the idol mammon, not of the phantom fame, but of that high philosophy which is derived from the perusal of men, not books; which is learned, not in the solitary chamber nor by the midnight lamp, but on the tented field and in the dazzling court; at the banquet and the masque; amid the treacheries of men and the wilier fascinations of beauty;—riding by the bridle of his own betrothed, through the very fields in which he had won, years before, her virgin heart;—hastening to the embrace of a father, whom, much as he revered and honoured him, he loved yet more? Who may describe that wonderful and deep sensation, that tincture of joy and sorrow, of bitterness and pleasure, which must be mingled to make up the draught of human happiness, exhibited no less in the gushing tear than in the glittering smile—in the choked voice and suffocating spasm, than in the flashing eye and the exulting pulse? Enough—he was for the moment happy, absolutely and—if aught mortal may be called perfect—perfectly happy. The antiquated hall burst on his vision as he passed a belt of sheltering evergreens, its tall Elizabethan chimneys sending their columns of vaporous smoke far up into the calm heaven; its diamond-paned oriels glowing like sheets of fire to the reflected sun; its hospitable porch yawning to admit stranger or guest alike with kindly welcome; its freestone terraces, with a group of lazy greyhounds basking on the steps, and a score or two of peacocks perched upon the balustrades, like the ornaments of an eastern throne, or strutting to and fro on the broad flag-stones in all their pride of gorgeous plumage. He saw—he had no words—but his gentle companion might perceive his nether lip to quiver with strong emotion, and a tear, unrestrained by selfish pride, to trickle down his manly cheek. A heavy bell rang out; there was a bustle, and a rush of many servitors, badged and blue-coated men, with hoary heads and tottering limbs—the heir-looms of the family, transmitted, with the ancestral armour and the ancient plate, from sire to son. With difficulty extricating himself from the familiar greeting of these domestic friends, he hurried up the steps; but, ere he crossed the threshold, a noble-looking man, far past the prime of life—as might be seen from his long locks, already streaked with wintry hues of age, but vigorous still and active— fell upon his neck with a quick shrill cry, “My son! my son!” the hot tears gushing from his eyes —not that he mourned, but that he did rejoice—to borrow the magnificent words of the Greek lyrist —as he beheld his chosen offspring, the stateliest of the sons of men. CHAPTER III. “Minstrel of freedom—England's holiest bard— His were the electric strains, that spurn control! That stir with lightning touch a nation's soul, Filling each heart with aspirations high, With zeal to do—to suffer—and to die! With fear of tyrants conquering fear of strife! With that high love—more strong than love of life— Which arms may not subdue, nor fetters pine,— The deathless love of liberty divine!” It was a beautiful and tranquil evening; the broad bright hunter's moon was riding through the cloudless firmament, bathing the whole expanse of heaven with a radiance so pervading, that the myriad stars were wellnigh quenched in her more lustrous glory. It was one of those evenings on which we cannot gaze without comparing the pure and passionless quiet of the world above with the fierce solicitudes, the selfish strife, the angry turmoil of the world around us—one of those evenings which at any time must infuse a sentiment of peaceful melancholy into every bosom, even of the wild and worldly; but which has at no time so deep an influence on the spirit as when contemplated from the near vicinity of some large city The contrast between the chaste paleness of those celestial lamps, and the ruddy glare of the terrene and lurid fires glancing from many a casement,— between the perfect calm alert, unbroken save by the gentle murmur of the wind, and the confused uproar below, rife with the din of commerce, the dissonance of mingled tongues, and now a distant scream, and now a burst of unmelodious laughter, must needs impress more strongly on the mind Vol. I.—D than aught of homily or lecture, that loathing of the mortal world, and the base things its tenants;— that ardent and inexplicable yearning after something of truer and more substantial happiness than we can here conceive,—that wish for “wings like a dove, that we might flee away and be at rest,”— which constitutes perhaps the most essential difference, as exhibited on earth, between ourselves and the yet lower animals, content to fatten and to perish. Such was not improbably the strain of thought into which the aspect of the night had led one—a man, not yet advanced beyond the prime of life, of elegant though low proportions—who stood gazing heavenward as he leaned against the low wall of a pleasant garden, which, girt about with its tall hedges of clipped box or hornbeam, its gay parterres, and its pleached bowery walks, a fair suburban villa; situate in what was then, as now, termed Aldersgate, though at that period not a densely-peopled thoroughfare, but a long straggling street, half town half country, with leafy elms lining the public way, and many a cultivated nursery and many a grassy paddock intervening between the scattered dwellings of the retired trader or the leisure-loving man of letters. The countenance of this person, as it was directed upward with a pensive wistful gaze toward the melancholy planet, receiving the full flood of its lustre, was singular for softness and attraction. He wore no covering on his head, and his luxuriant tresses of light brown hair, evenly parted on the foretop, hung down in silky waves quite to his shoulders. The hues of his complexion, delicately coloured as a woman's, and the somewhat sleepy expression of his full gray eye, accorded well with the effeminate arrangement of his locks, and indeed entitled him to be considered eminently handsome; for there was so much of intellect and of imagination in the forehead, low but expansive, and so many lines of thought about the slightly-sunken cheeks, now faintly traced and transient, but which would, with the advance of years, increase to furrows, that the softer traits, while adding to the beauty, detracted nothing from the dignity and manhood of his aspect. His form, though low and small, was yet compact and muscular, affording promise of that powerful agility which is paramount even to superior strength in the use and skill of weapons. Neatly clad enough in a loose coat of dark gray cloth, with vest and hose of black, cut plainly without lace or fringe; and, above all, not wearing even the common walking-sword, at that time carried throughout Europe by all of gentle rank, the meditative loiterer would have excited little or no attention among the greater body of mankind, ever caught by the glitter, and deluded by the glare, but careless as it is undiscerning of true merit, when harbingered to its opinion by naught of pride or circumstance. He might have been an artisan or merchant of the city, but that the slouched hat, lying with a staff of ebony beside him on the wall, distinguished him from the flatcapped dwellers to the east of Temple Bar; while his hands, which were delicately white, and tender as a lady's, showed that they had never been exercised in the ungentle labour of a mechanic calling. But, stronger even than these tokens, there was that vivid and inexplicable impress of exalted genius, that looking forth of the immortal spirit from the eyes, that strange mixture of quiet melancholy with high enthusiasm, pervading all his features, which must have made it evident to any moderately keen observer, that figure or decoration could be but of small avail when considered as the mere appendages to such a mind. He stood a while in silence, though his lips moved at intervals, perusing the bright wanderers of heaven with a gaze so fixed and yearning as though his spirit would have looked through them, the windows of the firmament, into the very tabernacle and abode of the Omnipotent. At length he spoke articulately, in a voice deep, slow, majestic, and melodious, but in the unconscious tones of one who meditates or prays aloud, without reference or respect to aught external. “Beautiful light,” he said; “beautiful lamp of heaven—what marvel that the blinded and benighted heathen should ignorantly worship thee? What marvel that a thousand altars, in a thousand ages, should have sent up their fumes of adoration unto thee the mooned Ashtaroth, unto thee the Tauriform Diana, unto thee the nightly visitant of the young-eyed Endymion? What marvel that to those who knew not, neither had they heard of the One, Uncreate, Invisible, Eternal, thou shouldst have seemed meet Deity to whom to bend the knee,—thou firstborn offspring of his first-created gift—thou blessed emanation from his own ethereal glory—when I, his humble follower, his ardent though unworthy worshipper,—when I, an honest though an erring Christian, do strive in vain to wean my heart from love of thee; indoctrinating so my spirit that I may kiss the rod with which, I am assured too well, HE soon will chastise me, in changing the fair light, that glorious essence in which my soul rejoiceth, for one black, everlasting, self-imparted midnight? Yet so it shall be. A few more revolutions of these puissant planets,—a few more mutations of the sweet-returning seasons,—and to me there shall be no change again on earth for ever! No choice between the fairest and the foulest! No difference of night or day! No charm in the rich gorgeousness of flowery summer above the sere and mournful autumn! No cheery aspect in the piled hearth of winter! No sweet communion with the human eye compassionate! No intercourse with the great intellects of old, dead, yet surviving still in their sublime and solid pages!” He paused for a space, as though he were too deeply moved to trust his thoughts to language; but, after a moment, drawing his hand across his eyes—“But if it be so,” he continued, “as I may not doubt it will—if his fiat be pronounced against me of dark corporeal blindness, what duty yet remains? What—but to labour that the blindness be not mental also? What—but to treasure up even now, during my brief-permitted time, such stores of hoarded wisdom as may in part suffice, like to the summer-gathered riches of the industrious and thrifty bee, to nourish and to cheer me at the coming of my senseless season? What— but to profit, even as best I may, by those good opportunities which his great mercy hath vouch-safed to me; to sow the seed even now, during the fertile autumn, that by his blessing it may swell and germinate during the brumal darkness of the approaching winter, and in his good time give forth to light a crop improved and gloriously surpassing that from which it sprung? What—but to give thanks alway, and to praise the tender-heartedness and love of Him, to whom it were no harder task to plunge the mind in lunatic and senseless stupor, than to seal up the fount of light to the poor eye. Of Him, who, giving all the thousand blessings I enjoy, judges it fitting to deprive me but of one, haply that from its single loss others may fructify, and bear good harvest to my use? Wherefore, oh D 2 merciful and mighty One, be it unto me as thou willest, and thou only. And oh! above all things, be it unto me, as now, so alway, humbly to cry, and happily, Thy will be done.” Even as the pious scholar brought his meditations to a close, the footsteps of one advancing, though still unseen, through the mazes of the shrubbery, were heard upon the crisp and crackling gravel; and, ere he had resumed his hat, which was steeple-crowned and of the puritanic fashion, the intruder made his appearance, in the guise of an humbly-clad and grave-eyed servingman, who announced, in phrase ungarnished by much form of reverence toward his master, the presence of three gentlemen within, praying to speak with him. “In faith,” returned the other, “in faith, good Andrew, 'tis an unseasonable hour for visitants! Who be these gentles?” “Master Cromwell is among them,” answered the attendant; “but of the rest I know not, save that I heard the name of St. John pass between them. They await your coming in the summer parlour.” Without farther query or reply, the scholar, as if satisfied that his presence was indeed required, traversed the garden with quick steps; and entering the house, a small but cheerful dwelling, through an entrance hung round with maps and charts of statistics or chronology, passed to the chamber in which his guests expected him. It was a pleasant room, with a bay-window looking upon the garden, but cheaply decorated with hangings of green serge, to which a splendid organ, by the first maker of the day, and a choice collection of rare books, several of the number being papyri of great worth, afforded a remarkable contrast. In the recess formed by the window there stood a reading-desk, curiously carved in old black oak, with cushions of green velvet, somewhat the worse for wear, supporting a noble folio Bible in the Greek text of Geneva. The table was loaded with a heterogeneous mass of books and papers, an original manuscript of the Bacchæ of Euripides, reposing on a Hebrew copy of the Septuagint, and a stray duodecimo of Petrarch's sonnets, marking the place at which the reader had closed the pages of a huge tome of controversial divinity; while, on a marble slab opposite the chimney, lay a couple of foils, with their wire masks and gloves, partially hidden by the draperies of a threadbare mantle of black velvet; a violin, a guitar, some written music, and, peering out from beneath the whole, the iron basket-hilt and glittering scabbard of a heavy broadsword. In this the student's sanctum, he found the three gentlemen who had been announced, evidently engaged in whispered conversation of deep import, for they did not perceive the presence, till he had stood for a moment or two almost beside them, of their host; who had thus ample opportunity of examining their persons, by the light of a brazen lamp of antique form, with several burners, which hung from the ceiling immediately above the abstracted group. Nearly opposite the door, with his searching eyes fixed upon another of the company, who was speaking with considerable emphasis, though in an under tone, stood the same individual who had assisted Ardenne on the night of his adventure near to Royston; wearing the very garb in which he had appeared on that occasion, save that, for his riding-boots, he had substituted a pair of coarse gray woollen stockings, drawn tight to the mid-thigh, with ill-blacked shoes of calfskin, laced to the instep, and bearing neither rose nor buckle. The speaker, to whose words he lent so careful heed, was a tall and slender person, handsomely, though gloomily, attired in a full suit of black, with silken hose and velvet cloak to match, a mourning rapier hanging at his side, though evidently worn for fashion rather than for use. His countenance, though not of pleasant favour, much less such as could be termed handsome, was nevertheless one from which men could not easily withdraw their eyes, possessing attributes of unquestionable talent, though accompanied by an expression which none so dull but they would wish to fathom. His eyes, which were large and black, had a bright and flashing glance when under influence of excitement almost painful to the beholder; while a continual, and, as it would seem, involuntary sneer, sat on his thin and writhing lip. His hair, black as the raven's wing, was long and curling, though not worn after the flowing fashion of the cavaliers; but the most remarkable trait of his aspect was the immoveable gloom which overshadowed his dark saturnine features with a cloud so constant, that it has been recorded of him, that seldom, even in his moments of hilarity, was he beheld to smile. The remaining person of the trio was a finer and more comely man than either of his comrades; fairly proportioned, though not above the middle height, with a brow rather full than lofty, a quick and penetrating eye, and an intelligent expression, thoughtful rather than grave, and with no touch of sternness or morosity on his noble features, lighted up, as they were from time to time, by a smile of singular and cheerful sweetness. He was habited as became a gentleman, in a rich garb of marone-coloured velvet, his costly sword suspended from a scarf of good white taffeta, and a white feather in his beaver; the whole— though plain enough, if compared with the luxurious bravery of the cavaliers, whose dresses would oftentimes have been too cheaply rated at a year's income of their patrimony—conveying an idea of absolute magnificence, when viewed beside the simple habiliments of his fellow-visiters. After he had surveyed this group for a few moments' space, satisfied apparently with the survey, the master of the house stepped forward, startling them slightly by his motion, and cutting short their converse. “Give you good evening, Master Cromwell,” he said, addressing himself to the most slovenly-apparelled of the company; “it shames me to have caused you wait my coming.” “Not so, good sir,” returned the other; “it is we rather who have trespassed on your studies, coming thus at an hour surely unseasonable. But, of a truth, I had forgotten—I pray you, Master Milton,” for it was no other than the immortal poet, who had deplored, in such heartfelt yet unrepining language, the advent of that dread calamity, which had already been predicted to him by the first physicians of the day as the sure consequence of his persisting in his arduous and unremitted labours,—“I pray you, Master Milton, know these most worthy and God-fearing gentlemen! This,” motioning with his hand toward the taller and more gloomy figure, “this, my good friend, Master Oliver St. John; and this, my well-beloved and trusty cousin, honest John Hampden.” “Of a truth, Master Cromwell,” replied the poet—in those days better known by his magnificent and stately prose, for a controversial writer of unequalled power, than by the slight though beautiful effusions of poetry which hitherto he had cast forth merely as the erratic sports of leisure moments, stolen from graver studies, and not yet as the sublime continuous soarings of his unrivalled genius,—“of a truth, Master Cromwell, I owe you more of thanks than I am wont to offer, that you have brought to my poor dwelling these, the most constant and the noblest cultivators of that fair vineyard, to the renewal and reform of which I too, an humble fellow-tiller, have devoted my unworthy labours!” And he turned to the companions of his friend, esteemed already by all the worshippers of freedom as the wisest, the purest, and the best of her adorers!—as the pilots, who might alone be trusted to hold the shattered helm of state aright, amid the terrors, the confusion, and the storm of the approaching crisis!—as the champions, who had already reared the banner of undaunted opposition to all that was corrupt, or bigoted, or arbitrary, in religious or in civil rule!—as the leaders, who, above all others, were endowed with the talent, and the worth, and, more than these, with the unflinching energy to wring the iron sceptre of usurped prerogative from the high hand that wielded it with such despotic sway! He greeted them with words savouring more of courteous deference than of that plain-spoken and uncompromising brevity, on the use of which his party prided themselves so deeply in their intercourse of man with man. There was, however, nothing of vain or worldly adulation, much less of that fawning sycophancy, that low servile man-worship, for which the courtiers of the day were so deservedly contemned by the stern puritans, in his frank though reverential bearing. After a few seconds spent in civilities, which were accepted, as indeed they were intended, for the befitting homage of one surpassing intellect to others, though in a different sphere, of not inferior merit—homage, degrading not the giver, while it added to the real dignity of the receiver,—the party fell into the ordinary demeanour of men familiar, if not with the persons, at least with the minds and principles each of the other; and the conversation flowed as quietly on the accustomed topics of the time as though the speakers had been in the daily wont of mingling in the same social intercourse. There was, however, not only naught of levity or license, but naught of common import or every-day occurrence, in the interchanged ideas of those high spirits, devoted, one and all, to the same pursuit of patriotism, and equally engrossed in the quick-succeeding incidents of fearful and pervading interest, which rendered every hour of that eventful year a great historic epoch. “Have ye received aught new from Ireland,” inquired the poet—“ye of the lower house, touching this perilous and damnable rebellion?” “Ay, of a surety have we!” answered Cromwell, “full confirmation—full, ay, and overflowing all that we had heard before!” “All Ulster is in one light blaze,” cried St. John, his dark eye flashing with indignant fire; “the forts all captured, and that most subtle villain, Phelim O'Neil, wading knee-deep—with thirty thousand fanatic and phrensied papists—knee-deep in Protestant and English gore! Connaught and Leinster revelling in red-handed massacre, and the five counties of the Pale, arrayed by the lords-justices to quell the insurrection, united to their brother rebels!” “None may conceive the horrors—none may enumerate the sufferings—or recount the wretched sufferers,” continued Hampden, a deep shade of melancholy settling down on his fine lineaments; “at the least reckoning, twenty thousand of our brethren, men, women, and children, yea, the very infants at the breast, have porished! No insult, no atrocity, that Romish perfidy could plan, or fiendish cruelty perform—no last extremity of famine, cold, or torture, has been spared to their defenceless victims by the barbarian Irish—the very priests setting the torch of midnight conflagration to the planter's dwelling, and hounding on their furious followers to massacre and havoc!” “But of the king, fair sirs?” “Well hast thou said, John Milton,” interrupted the harsh voice of Cromwell before the other had concluded his inquiry; “well has thou said and truly! 'tis of that man of Belial! ay, root and branch of him, and his self-seeking carnal cavaliers!” “It is, we fear, too true—” said Hampden, in reply to the bewildered looks of the anxious auditor; “it is, we fear, too true! O'Neil, in his dark proclamation, boasts openly his own authority from the great seal of Scotland. Sir William St. Leger, trusty alike and brave, hath, as we learn, dismissed his levies, and laid down the arms he had assumed on the first outbreak of the rebels, at sight of a commission, with Charles Stuart's manual sign, held by that murderous bigot Lord Musquerry.” “And last, not least,” sneered Oliver St. John, “Mac Mahon hath confessed, at shrewd solicitation of the rack, that the original scheme of this rebellion was brought to Ireland, from our gracious king and governor, by Dillon and the members of the late committee.” “Of a truth,” said Cromwell, in reply to the words of his milder cousin, “of a truth, there may be cause for fear, ay, and for grief—yet wherefore? Verily 'tis a hard thing to rejoice, to rejoice in the midst of slaughter and abomination! Yet who shall deem or boast himself to know of that which is to come, save He that holdeth the end, I say the end and the accomplishment of all things, in the hollow of his hand? But I will tell ye this—yea, but mistake me not,—this will I avouch to ye, that I fear not, but do rejoice! 'Tis a sad thing, in truth, that an anointed king, even a king in Israel, should arm his hand against his people, and turn away his countenance from the well-beloved of the Lord, inclining his ear likewise unto the idolatries of the beast, and unto the charmings of the Moabitish woman; yea, and pour out the vials of his wrath upon the heads of the sons of righteousness! But, of a surety, it is not for a man to judge save thus—for I will speak even as it is put into my mouth,—save thus—that, to a man foreweaponed and forewarned, less dangerous is an open enemy—yea, if he be mightier by tenfold,—than one who lurketh privily beneath the vesture of a friend, looking in secret whom he may devour!” “Forewarned indeed ye are,” replied the poet, musingly, “and your own fault 'twill be if ye be not foreweaponed likewise; for, in good sooth, I do believe the lives of none are safe—the lives and liberties of none who dare uplift their voices in defence of England's constitution or the church's purity.” “And is it not to this end,” cried Oliver, “and is it not to this end that we are watching, even now, with our loins girded, and our lights burning, watching unto the protection of those that are defenceless, and unto the enlightening of those that sit in darkness? And is it not to this end that we have now come to thee, John Milton, trusting to gain a strong ally—even a valiant, and a heart-whole, Vol. I.—E and a spirit-serving soldier!—seeking to learn form thee—so far as it is for man to learn of man, yet neither confident in worldly wisdom, which is ignorance before the Lord, nor relying altogether on the judgment of a fellow-worm, how excellent soever he may be in the gifts of carnal knowledge,—seeking, I say, to learn from thee the character and principles of one with whom we do believe that you so long have communed as to know the thoughts of his heart, ay, and to interpret the workings of his inward man!” “Such is indeed our object,” continued Hampden, while St. John fixed his searching eye upon the beautiful features of the listener with keen and interested scrutiny; “such is indeed our object in this untimely visit. We have but now received intelligence of the decease of that shrewd counsellor and honest patriot, Elias Chaloner, the fellow-townsman of my worthy cousin Cromwell, and lately member for the godly town of Huntingdon; and, with this same intelligence, the great charge has been laid upon us, by the zealous burghers of the place, of commending to their choice a person who shall honourably fill the post of him that is departed.” “And how? you would ask, John Milton,” Cromwell broke in, “for I can read the query on your brow—how, you would ask, can you assist us in this matter? Verily thus—for it hath been suggested to our souls when we were seeking out the Lord in prayer, yea, wrestling with him in the spirit, that he should guide us to a sure election,— it was,—I tell you truth, I do profess,—borne in upon the ears of our minds, as with an audible and spoken voice, `Ye shall call to aid the man— even the young man—Edgar Ardenne—”' “With whom,” interrupted St. John, evidently weary of the prolix, verbose haranguing of the other, “with whom, as we are well assured, you, Master Milton, have mingled much in foreign travel, having thereby good opportunity to judge of his opinions and to learn his heart. We would hear from you, therefore, worthy sir, whether this gentleman of high extraction, born of a race devotedly, I had wellnigh said slavishly, loyal—whether this gentleman be indeed, as we would wish to find him, a firm, uncompromising lover of his country—one who would pledge himself, and keep his plight religiously, to advance the views and serve the interests of our party! May it please you, tell us fully what of yourself you know, and what may be your judgment of this your fellow-traveller—and, above all, whether he may be wrought, and by what means, to further our purposes!” “For years,” replied the poet, after a moment's pause, “for years have I been wont to read the living minds of men with even more of study than I have expended on their embalmed and written thoughts—for years!—and never—I can say it honestly and freely, for I do believe I know his inmost aspirations even as I am conscious of my own—never have I found, or even read of such a head, combined with such a heart, as that of Edgar Ardenne. A worshipper of wisdom, of liberty, of truth—purer and far more fervently devoted than the great spirits of the old republics! A scholar in the study, and that too of the ripest—an orator in the forum, strong, stirring, and persuasive—a soldier in the field, well tried, and as well proven! An adorer of all that is beautiful, but one who sees no beauty save in virtue! A Christian, fervent and sincere, yet tolerant, and of much charity! Ambitious—but ambitious only to do good! If ever there was born a man wholly unselfish, that man is Edgar Ardenne. Such—and on my judgment well may you rely—such is the man whom you would take into your counsels. Gain him, then—gain him, if ye may—for certainly as Edgar Ardenne could achieve aught to benefit his country, though every hope, every feeling, every passion of his soul were listed to oppose it, so certainly would he tread hope, feeling, passion, into the very dust beneath his feet. He has a head so clear, he cannot fail to see the right—he has a heart so true, he would not fail—though at the price of all he holds most dear—to follow it. Beware, however,—beware, if ye decide to gain him, how you show aught of doubt, much less suspicion! —proffer to him the seat for Huntingdon untrammelled! say not a word of party—not a word of opposition to the court—make ye not one condition—ask not one pledge!—for had ye heaven itself to tender him, and were to tender it, so bribing him—ay, were it even to act well—my life! he would refuse even heaven! If, therefore, ye can resolve unpledged to trust him, seek not to sound his views—for as well might ye assay to fathom the most central depths of ocean;—seek not to bind his actions—for as well might ye go forth to chain the subtle and pervading lightning;—but proffer to him, in plain terms, the seat—at the free choice of the burghers—and if he do accept it, as well I trust he will, be sure there is no man in England that better knows the duties of a member in the commons House of Parliament, or trulier will discharge them!” “You have described,” replied the calm and meditative Hampden, “you have indeed described a man, such as there are but few this side the grave! Your words, too, tally well with the surmises I have formed from his known actions!” “And would you then,” asked the moody St. John, “would you then set so great a matter on the casting of a die? Do you not know that even now we have but a majority—not over-strong nor over-certain?—that many have been already won or put to silence—that Hyde and his moderate partisans daily gain strength, and only lack occasion to join the court in open and unblushing servitude? Know you not that Falkland wavers, and that, if he go over, ten votes at least will instantly apostatize? and would you then elect this cavalier, for such in truth he is, on vague hopes and uncertain indications?” “I said not so,” replied Hampden, quickly; “I said not so! but only that I believe him wise and honest! Farther I will say now, that—if, on any terms, we shall decide to recommend him to the choice of the electors—my voice is for so doing with nothing of restriction! If he be honest, it needs not to bind him by a promise—if otherwise, 'twere madness to suppose that promises will bind him! But on this matter we will speak more anon—we have already trespassed over long upon the leisure and the patience of our honourable host.” St. John replied not; and Cromwell, who had perhaps made up his mind already, had fallen into a long and rambling exposition of some doctrinal point, wholly remote from the subject in question, to which Milton listened with a tranquil smile playing about his well-turned lip, and with the aim apparently of discovering what was the meaning, if there indeed were any, of the wild and ill-digested oratory of the member for Cambridge, at this time just beginning to attract the notice of the house, though E 2 no one could perhaps assign a cause for his increasing influence. For a short space the others spoke apart, warmly, though in an under tone— Hampden, as it seemed, urging on his grave confederate some dubious or unpalatable measure; the energy of his manner gradually rising, while the opposition of his friend waxed fainter, until the habitual sneer departed from his lip, and the accustomed cloud partially yielded to an opener and more cheery aspect. “Be it so!” he said at length, raising his voice, as the discussion was finished by his assent; “be it so, if you will—and, in faith, I believe you are in the right on't! Now, Master Cromwell,” he continued, turning toward him as he spoke, “it lacks but a scant hour of midnight, and our host's oil, I trow, is wont to lend its light to purposes of more importance than our farther converse! Give you good night, fair sir,” he added, with a short inclination to the poet, as, gathering his cloak about him, he led his comrades, after brief ceremony, into the moon-lit streets; while he whom he had last addressed applied himself, in solitary diligence, to the exercise of his pen, slight instrument of mightiest powers, whether for good or evil, and, in the hand of the philosopher, prime mover of more potent revolutions than its dread rival and confederate—the mortal sword! CHAPTER IV. “Oh what more blest than that serene repose, Which steeps the sould forespent with foreign woes, What time we turn, our weary wanderings o'er, To the old homestead, thence to roam no more, And stretch our limbs in calm luxurious rest, On the dear bed our careless childhood pressed.” Catullus. —Free Translation. None know, but those who have for years been wanderers from the paternal roof, whether of choice or of necessity it matters not,—who have for years been sojourners, not dwellers, on the broad desert earth,—who, in the midst of friends almost as dear as those, who girt as with a magic cestus the unforgotten fireside of their childhood, have craved, with an insatiate and yearning appetite, the well-known aspect of the old home-places,—who have languished for a father's blessing, a mother's wistful eye, a sister's holy kiss,—who have felt, with the patriotic Syrian, that “Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus,” are truly to the exile “better than all the waters of Israel;”—none know, but these, the deep calm happiness of being once again the centre of that sweet domestic circle; of receiving the fond welcome of every living thing— ay, even to the household dog, or superannuated horse, that yelps or whinnies in the fulness of his recognition; of lying down to rest beneath the very curtains, and on the very bed, which had so often wooed them to repose before they knew the bitterness of sin or sorrow. Fully indeed, and far more sensibly than it is tasted by the common pilgrim of life's journey, did this impression of tranquil bliss pervade the breast of Ardenne, as he leaned, gazing upon the familiar landscape, from out the open casement of his chamber;—that chamber, which had never for a moment faded from his memory, with its oaken wainscoting and faded tapestries,—its angular recesses, peopled by his youthful fantasy with lurking shapes of terror,—its pleasant seats in the deep bay windows, —its brazen-handled cabinets of quaint device—its bed with sculptured tester and dark hangings,—and, more than all, its ebon desk, with the velvet-bound and silver-studded Bible, whence his long-lost and long-regretted mother had lessoned him so lovingly while he was yet a boy. The moonlight lay upon the velvet park and tufted elms, as though it loved to sleep among that peaceful scenery; and if, at intervals, it shone reflected from the surface of some quiet water, it lingered even there with a half-shadowed lustre, not flashing out with the bright gleams of gorgeous sunshine, but calmly harmonizing with the spirit of the place and hour. So clear, however, was the mellow light, that the graceful attitudes of the slumbering deer might be distinguished on the open lawns, while the pinion of the gliding owl was seen to glance against the massy shadows of the surrounding forest. Yet now, although he gazed upon all that was most beautiful of natural scenery,—all that was most endeared to him by boyish recollections,—although he was surrounded by the very objects that he had most earnestly desired to see,—although he was at the very point which he but yesterday would have esteemed the summit of fruition—he was not happy. It is true, that he had found in her on whom his mind had dwelt most fondly and most frequently during his absence, the very being he had loved so fervently of yore—bearing no traces of the years which had elapsed, save in the ripening of her mind to excellent maturity, and in the rounding of her sylph-like figure into the exquisite proportions of young womanhood! It is true that the father, whom he had honoured and obeyed with that old-fashioned filial reverence, which—ill betide the change—has long since passed away, together with the diamond-hilted rapiers, and the somewhat formal courtesy of our progenitors, had welcomed him to his affections, a man yet in the prime of intellectual vigour! It is true that he had brought back to his native land a heart untainted by the follies and the sins of foreign countries; a mind well satisfied, not by the baseless arguments of boyish prejudice, but by the strong convictions of experience, that his own earth-fast island was indeed the home best calculated for the seekers of that sweet domestic quietude, that fireside, church-going happiness—that calm enjoyment of the duties, the labours, and the pleasures of a country life, blent, as these ever are, with a romantic taste for the green fields and slumbering woodlands, the gentle river and the smooth hill-side—which have at all times formed a feature so distinctive in the English character! But it is no less true that, even at the moment when his hand might have been said to grasp all that his soul desired, his spirit was disturbed, and his heart ill at ease. It were perhaps the wisest, as it surely were the happiest course, for mortals to obey the dictates equally inculcated by the disciples of two schools, which, seemingly the most at variance with each other, are nevertheless in truth as similar in not a few essentials, as it is possible for creeds to be in other points so diverse as those entertained by the followers of Epicurus and—with reverence be it spoken—of the Saviour,—both recommending— nay, both strenuously urging the necessity, and in words almost identical, that we “take no heed for the morrow.” Yet, in a mortal sense, obedience to this injunction is perhaps impossible—impossible at least to any man endowed with enough of intellect and mental vigour to perceive the connexion between present causes and eventual effects—to foresee with prescient sagacity the crop which will spring up to-morrow from the seed laid in the ground to-day!—For who could sit at ease, appreciating the full quality of each delicious viand, pleasantly debating on the flavour of each fragrant wine, knowing that the sword of Damocles was swinging by a single hair—and that, too, yielding at every instant to the weight—above his head? Had it not been for this—had it been possible for Ardenne to seal up his eyes and close his ears against the evidence of what to-morrow must bring forth— had he lacked the wisdom to discover the future destinies of England, her vitals even now convulsed by the first throes of the incipient earthquake—or the patriotism to sympathize with the afflictions which, as that wisdom taught him, must ere another year befall his country—he might have surrendered himself to momentary pleasure, careless or ignorant of the approaching wo. And—so rare of occurrence, and so brief when they do occur, are the periods during human life even of comparative happiness—perhaps, had he so done, he had been able to look back in after days to more of sunny hours than he could count among the strange and mingled incidents of his eventful life. But, constituted as he was, it was not in his power to fix his gaze on the bright present aspect of the things around him, without observing the huge melancholy clouds which were rising up on the political horizon, threatening to overshadow with their gloomy pall, and perhaps to overwhelm in the wild tempest they must soon discharge, the feeble shallop of his fortunes, together with the stronger vessel of the constitution. At an early period of his life a visiter of southern lands—where he had wandered, not to mark alone the sunny skies and desolated fields, the ruined temples and the beautiful cascades, but to muse on the condition of the nations once so powerful and so degraded now; to ponder on their rise and fall; to draw deep lessons of the future from the contemplation of the past; he had learned to cherish liberty the more from having witnessed, if not himself endured, the wrongs, the misery, and the oppression of unlimited authority. Summoned of late by rumours rife throughout the world of present disagreement and of coming strife between the king and parliament of his own country, he had returned to England at the instigation of his natural sense of duties, which forbade him to expend his energies of heart and hand in the service of a foreign prince, when both might be required to aid the better cause of liberty or loyalty; no less than at the dictates of those natural affections which, sooner or later, will point, as surely as the magnetic needle to the north, toward the home of childhood. While on the journey, all his thoughts had been of joy— of that serene and moderate happiness which makes the days flow onward like a broad and tranquil river, fertilizing some fair plain, rich with the hopes of thousands—beautiful, but with an indescribable and unromantic beauty—presenting none of those wild charms, those scenes at once sublime and lovely to the eye, which mark the course of far-famed torrents amid the savage glens of moorland, moss, and mountain—but leaving on the mind a mingled sentiment of gratitude and bliss that will be fresh and vivid when the sterner memory of its rivals shall have yielded to oblivion. His spirit had looked forward to a long perspective of sunshiny years—years not to be degraded by the selfish sloth of luxury; not to be wasted in the mere sports of the field, which, useful, ay, and ennobling in their tendencies, when partaken but as a relief to grave and solid duties, so surely brutalize if they be exalted to a daily occupation; not to be dreamed away in apathetic musings and would-be philosophy; but to be dignified by high and patriotic labours—by the cultivation of the sciences and arts—by the promotion of public virtue and domestic worth—to be enlivened by the gay communion of the noble and the good—to be softened by the sweet charities, the endearing ties, the holy sympathies that clasp within their pale the members of a happy family—and to be closed at length by a calm death-bed amid weeping friends, and by a grave beneath the elms of the ancestral church-yard, still to be decked with flowers, and pointed out to far posterity as the long home of one whose life had been a course, to which death had but brought the consummation, of unbending honour. Such, when the chalky cliffs loomed white and lofty, such were the fond anticipations, the imaginations, never perhaps to be realized, which poured their gilded halo round his heart; and when he felt his foot once more securely planted on the parent soil, when all those gushing influences of mingled ecstasy and tenderness swept in an overwhelming torrent over his every sense, he deemed that all his hopes were on the point of being gratified—that he was indeed about to be the happiest of men. The rumours of evil seemed to fade away; the menaces of political discord, perchance even of civil strife, to mutter only at a distance, if not unheard, at least unworthy to create solicitude; the fears that would at times arise unbidden, clouding with darker shades the bright hues of his mental painting, were all forgotten; and when he arrived, as he had done that evening, at the dear home of his boyhood; when he perceived the mighty pleasure that lightened forth from every feature of his admiring father; when he found himself revelling in the manifest affections of his destined bride, and knew that she partook of the same rapture, and in no less degree, he for a while abandoned his whole soul to the tide of feeling; he suffered himself to be carried away by his enjoyment of the present, careless and fearless of the future; he felt, perhaps for the first time of his life, during those brief hours that elastic buoyancy of temper which seems to tread the earth with winged steps, about to soar aloft, insensible to aught that may depress, reckless of all that may oppose—that rapt intoxication of the spirit, which is succeeded so invariably by the contrary extreme of listless, sad despondency, that, in the northern parts of Britain, it has given rise to a pervading superstition, to an undoubting creed, that such is the forerunner and the omen, not of a causeless gloom,. but of a coming evil. However this may be, it nevertheless is certain, that scarcely had he retired from that delicious intercourse to the seclusion of his own apartment, ere the exhilaration, which had almost surprised himself while he indulged it, gave place, first, to an uncertain sense of restlessness—then to a consciousness of some impending evil, increasing in distinctness moment after moment, till it assumed at length the shape of an anxiety, if not a fear, positive, well-defined, and, alas! but too well grounded. Nothing, indeed, but the whirl of mingled Vol. I.—F sensations, leaving room for naught of serious meditation, could have, even thus far, blinded Ardenne to the difficulties and the dangers of his future course. The boasted loyalty of his forefathers—their fond devotion, stronger almost than life, to the king, not as a person, but as a portion, and that the most important, of the state—their orthodox and sturdy zeal, condemning all as sectaries and fanatics who differed in the least from the established canons of the church—their prejudiced affection for all that was antique, even for antique error!—their holding up all those who would improve or alter, with the most diffident and sparing hand, as innovators on the good old times, as levellers of rank and order, as iconoclasts of the holy constitution, as traitors to their monarch, to their country, to their God! All these, he could not but remember, had been the principles impressed upon his dawning intellect as the very elixir of political wisdom—as the examples which must point the steps of every Ardenne—as the dogmata for the maintenance of which he must, if ever called upon to do so, rejoicingly expend his fortune and his blood! All these, he could not but foresee, must still, according to all human calculation, be the favourite maxims of his father, who—as he felt in contradiction of those hopes, which, even in spite of hope, he knew unfounded—would be too like to deem the slightest deviation from the footsteps of his idols as the worst apostacy!—the most respectful opposition to the arbitrary will of the misguided sovereign as flat rebellion!—the most moderate interference in behalf of liberal views and privileges of the people as a banding against the legitimate aristocracy of the land with all that was low, and sordid, and degraded!—too like, in short, to deem the part which Edgar felt already to be the only one he could in honour or in honesty espouse, a base abandonment of his natural position—a shameful dereliction from the principles and virtues of his race—a crime not to be atoned for, even by exclusion from his heart and expulsion from the home of his fathers! And had he been able even heretofore and at a distance to close his eyes against this fatal certainty, he must indeed have been both blind and deaf of heart had he not marked the words of blasting sarcasm, of fierce and fiery hatred, which flashed forth as oft as any casual mention intervened of those who had stood forth to check the headlong declination of the English Church toward dreaded popery, or the more rapid increase of prerogative toward absolute and autocratic sway. But they had not escaped him. Although unnoted, or at least unremarked, amid the free and flowing conversation of that first evening, and unable for the time to dash his most unusual exuberance of animal spirits, they had sunk deep into his heart;—and now they rose in long array against him, ghastly and gloomy shapes, reproaching him with his unnatural and foolish joy, and pointing to an endless course of tribulation and of sorrow. Nor was this all!—though this had been enough to overshadow a temperament more sanguinely inclined than that of Edgar Ardenne, determined as he was to follow that which he himself should deem the wise, the upright, and the honourable way of action, though such should be avenged by the prostration of all his fancy's idols—by the ruin of his fortunes—by the blighting of his nearest and dearest aspirations—and, more intolerable far than all beside, by the forfeiture of that high opinion which his merit had induced, and the frustration of that just expectance which his promise had excited in the bosoms of his friends and kinsmen. Nor was this all! For, as he pondered now in the lone stillness of the night, as he reviewed with a dispassionate, keen-sighted judgment the occurrences of the past day—as he recurred to every word that had fallen from the lips to which he looked for love, and life, and every thing—to every expression which had wreathed in smiles, or clouded with disapprobation, the soul-fraught lineaments of Sibyl—he could not bless himself with the conviction, scarce even with the hope, that she was not, although in a less stern degree, a holder of the same ancestral prejudices—a worshipper of the same creed, hallowed as it was by much that naturally would call forth the sympathies of a mind imbued with all the poetry of feudal recollections, not as yet faded from the earth—by the high chivalrous devotion—the noble and unselfish confidence—the enthusiastic valour—the unsullied memory and cloudless glory, of the days when kings were loved as second only to the gods—when loyalty was regarded as a virtue among men, in the same rank with piety toward Heaven. Whither then—whither had fallen his exulting fancies—whither had flown his visionary prospects of a useful and a happy life, of an honoured and regretted end—if the paths of happiness and honour were destined to run diverse? If—his heart burning with the pure and hallowed flame of liberty, his head clearly appreciating the miserable and abhorred aims of the rash man who wore the crown of England, his whole soul glowing with patriotic ardour—he must either prostitute his energies to make what to him seemed the worse appear the better cause—must either lift his voice to justify and to defend time-honoured wrong and new-devised oppression—must either edge the weapon of the despot with all the powers of his arm—or, following the dictates of his own conscience, ranking himself among the vindicators of the constitution to its early purity, among the assertors of a legitimate and tempered freedom—as far removed from the wild anarchy and license of falsely styled republics, as from the forced obedience and intolerant rule of arbitrary governors— must be content to sacrifice all that his heart held worthy its acceptance! if, in short, he must act a part dishonest and unworthy, so to gain those ordinary means of happiness, to which none so lowly but they do aspire; or must surrender every hope, nay, every possibility of earthly bliss, at the inflexible commands of duty and of honour? These were the dark reflections into which the mind of Ardenne had relapsed, as he stood alone, gazing from the lattice of his chamber into the bosom of the night, profiting by, if not enjoying, the first moments of calm solitude, the first opportunity for quiet and heart-searching meditation, that had fallen to his lot since he had been numbered once again among the dwellers beneath the oaken shades of his paternal Woodleigh. Nor, as the hours of night passed, not unheralded by musical chimes from the old belfry, and the moonlight waned in the peaceful sky, did his wild thoughts and sad forebodings give way to aught of weariness; the more he pondered, and the less able did he seem to find the slightest clew to guide his footsteps through the gloomy labyrinth of the future—the longer he sat gazing on the pallid stars, and the less he felt disposed for slumber— till at length, the spirit moving, as it were, too rapidly, and the blood coursing through his veins too fiercely to permit the body to remain inactive, he arose, scarce conscious that he did so, and paced the oaken floor, backward and forth, with F 2 swift irregular steps, the livelong night. Gradually the coming of the early twilight dappled the darkness of the eastern sky; a bird or two, of those which had securely roosted under the ivy-curtained eaves, awaking with a lively chirp, gave notice of the dawn; and anon the calm and colourless light of an autumnal morning crept into Ardenne's chamber, dispelling from its every nook the massy shadows which had nestled, like unholy spirits, in those deep recesses, beneath the partial influence of the moon. But all unnoted by its occupant had those successive changes circled the firmament; and when the sound of voices and of footsteps, passing to and fro the corridors, announced the return of those bright hours allotted to so much of human toil and sorrow, he absolutely started in surprise, and almost doubted whether it could indeed be morning, that had stolen on his waking dreams, and found him still a watcher. With something like a smile at his own thoughtful carelessness, he turned to change and alter his discomposed attire; and as he dashed the pure cold water over his throbbing temples, and bathed his feverish hands, he perceived that its refreshing coolness pervaded not his body only, but calmed and soothed his mind; and when the merry bell summoned its hearers to that most unrestrained and sociable of meetings, the morning meal, he descended the old staircase, gazing on its walls, decked with time-honoured banners, and glittering with starry groups of weapons—and on its landing-places guarded by complete panoplies of steel, standing erect with advanced arms and lowered visors, as if still tenanted by the strong frames that had supported them of yore amid the din of battle, if not with a heart at ease, at least with a countenance that bore no traces of the conflict still at work within. On entering the summer parlour, as such rooms were termed in the quaint language of the time, wherein meet preparations for a breakfast, far more solid than are used in these degenerate days, had been already made, he found his destined bride alone, in a projecting oriel window, seated on the broad-cushioned ottoman which circled the recess, with a light frame before her, filled with a gorgeous Indian silk, on which her art had traced some fair embroideries, yet incomplete— but, though the many-coloured skeins assorted within reach, and the well-filled needle between her taper-fingers, showed that she had commenced her feminine and graceful occupation, the thoughtful attitude of her head, languidly propped on her left hand, while the right lay motionless on the rich texture, belied her fancied industry. So noiselessly had Edgar's step fallen on the soft Turkey carpet that she had not perceived his entrance; and so beautiful was the picture of still life which she afforded to her lover's gaze, that he lingered for a moment ere his voice should rouse her into animation. A flood of morning lustre streamed downward with a golden hue, caught from the teinted panes, upon her glossy hair and pure complexion, cireling her entire form with a halo of rich light, not unlike that with which the painters of the Romish school are wont to dignify their female saints and martyrs. The outlines of her beautiful shape were mellowed, as it were, and shrouded partially by the hazy beams of sunshine which fell in oblique lines between her person— simply arrayed in a close bodice, accurately fitted to her fine bust, and a full robe of white—and the observer's eye. Her luxuriant tresses folded plainly about the contour of her small and classic head, without ornament or gem of any kind, and the exceeding repose, if it might not be termed melancholy, of her sweet features, giving, together with the accidents of light and shade, a madona-like and sainted aspect to her figure, which would have enchained an artist with no less of fascination than it exercised, from different reasons, over the mind of Ardenne. As he approached, her delicate ear detected him; she turned her head, and springing to her feet,—“Dear Edgar,” she exclaimed, her eye discovering with instinctive quickness the trace of melancholy left upon his lineaments, however faintly, by his nightly musings; “Dear Edgar—you are ill at ease—nay, smile not —'tis a ghastly smile, not of your own expression! —you are ill at ease—have passed a sleepless night—” “Sweet Sibyl,” he replied, with a wan smile, and gently pressing her extended hand, “you are indeed a keen observer; too keen, believe me!— How should I be but well and happy, surrounded thus by all I love most tenderly?” “How indeed, Edgar?” she answered, even more sadly than before. “How indeed—if you do love so tenderly?—But ill at ease you are, and have been sleepless! All night long have I heard your heavy strides upon the chamber floor, and those not regular and measured as your wont, but fitful and uncertain. So do not pass the happy their first night beneath the roof that saw their birth.” “If I do love, Sibyl,—if!” he exclaimed, with deep, almost reproachful energy; “but, in good truth, I am a poor dissembler, and could scarcely feign, were it to win even thy heart, Sibyl—and, for it seems I must confess me, I am somewhat, though slightly, ill at ease—” “I knew—I knew it at a glance,” she interrupted him; “and wherefore then conceal it?— Good Dr. Masters, though somewhat past his prime, still ministers, and skilfully, to his familiar patients—an hour will have him here—” and she moved hastily toward a silver hand-bell, which stood, with books, and drawings, and a lady's lute, upon a fairy-looking cabinet of tortoise-shell and marquetry. “Nay! nay!” he cried, gently arresting her, “I meant not so!—Be not alarmed, dear Sibyl,— mine is a robust frame, not oft or easily affected by aught of feebleness or ailment. My mind hath been of late somewhat overwrought—but a few days, consumed in the enjoyment of home-happiness and the delights of your society, shall speedily restore me. Look not so grave—so sad—I do beseech you.” “Oh, Edgar,” she interrupted him again, “tell me, if you do love me, tell me all! long years have we been parted—parted, as I have hoped—as, from your kind and fervent letters, I have well believed —in body, not in soul! and is it now—oh, is it to be thus? Are we to be but more divided when we are more together? Have we but met to be more widely and more coldly severed! Oh! if you love me, let me know your griefs! Who before me should know?—or who, as I, would share them?” “All—all,” he answered, in the hollow voice of one who struggles vainly with his feelings, forcing a smile as faint as a December's sunbeam,—“you shall share all—grief—happiness—life—death— eternity!—All, all, sweet Sibyl, if that indeed you be so minded! From you I have had—I will have no secrets—but now, I do assure you, I am not in grief—how should I? Something of gloomy thought may have come over me—something of moody sadness—causeless and senseless—such as will float at times across the brains of all who think—as I do—deeply. But no, Sibyl, no; I am not unhappy! Not for the proudest station upon earth would I exchange this fond proximity to thee—not for the universal blast of the world's approbation would I barter that bright tear—shed for me, Sibyl—or that yet brighter smile that chases it. Cheer up, my own own love; we will talk more of this anon—for lo! there comes my father!” And as he spoke, attired in hunter's garb of green, booted to the mid-thigh, with bugle-horn and wood-knife usurping the place of rapier and of poniard, and with two gallant stag-hounds at his heel, the noble veteran entered. “Alert—alert!” he cried, with a gay smile; “you of young blood! Methought I was myself full early stirring, but here are ye, in rising as in all else, beforehand with me. What ho! ye loitering knaves—hurry our breakfast! 'Tis a rare morning, Edgar—a soft mild wind, a heavy dew last eventide, and the clouds gently rising. Old Stavely tells me he has harboured a right hart of grease—a stag of ten!—and I have sent out riders these four hours agone to rouse the country. The Outrams will be here anon—you mind the Outrams, boy, your college mates of yore, and now right noble gallants—and Atherstone, of Ashstead Hall—and old Lord Middleton, with his brave sons! Friends all—true friends, thought some of them, I doubt, forgotten! But, 'fore George, we will make a day of it!” Thus the old man ran on, overlooking in his light-hearted cheerfulness the evident abstraction of his listeners, although they rallied up enough of animation to maintain some sort of conversation during their hasty meal, which scarce was ended, ere Sir Henry started from his seat. “See! see!” he cried, as a fair cavalcade swept past the windows, their plumes waving in the light west wind, spurs jingling, and steeds curvetting—“see! they be here, even now; and lo! the pack!” As—with their attendant huntsmen and half a score of prickers, splendidly mounted on blood horses, in forest jerkins sumptuously laced, round caps, and huge French horns encircling their shoulders—restrained by many an echoing shout and many a clanging lash, some twenty couple of tall northern blood hounds came trotting slowly up the lawn, in all that accuracy of condition and perfection of detail which has, in every period of her history, been so distinctive of the field-sports of England! “Fly, Sibyl—fly, my fairy,” cried the impatient veteran. “Do on your riding gear right speedily. Ariel is champing on his bits even now to summon you! Edgar and I meanwhile will look to our guests in the great hall. Dally not, girl, I pray you—the sun is shrouded even now, and the scent will lie most bravely. I would not, to be Prince of Wales, lose such a morning! What ho! my jovial roisters,” he continued in a louder tone, striding into the huge vaulted hall through one door, as his fair niece vanished at the other.— “What ho! my jovial roisters,” addressing the laughing group who waited his arrival. “Here have ye an old friend, whom some of ye perchance have not as yet forgotten.” And with a prouder air and more exulting smile, he introduced his gallant son, unseen for many a year, to his admiring friends. A short half hour flitted pleasantly away in heartfelt greetings and gay converse of light moment, but lively, joyous, and sincere. Then every high-plumed hat was doffed, and every voice was lowered, as Sibyl Ardenne, with her attendant maidens, meetly equipped for the field, entered the hall! “To horse! to horse!” and the ladies were assisted to their velvet selles by favoured cavaliers, and the gallants vaulted to their saddles, and threw their chargers on their haunches by dint of curb and spur, and drew their forms to the most graceful attitude, as with courtly merriment and sylvan music they swept away through shadowy avenues and over shaven lawns, to the wilder coppices and more secluded glades of chase and forest. CHAPTER IV. “The chase is o'er. Go couple up the pack, And let your lusty horn ring holyday To the swinked foresters. We'll hunt no more, Since duty calls of gravest import stern, And deep election—of high causes twain Which is the better!” The hunt was at its height! The noble stag— which had been harboured on the previous night in a deep swampy thicket, situate at the extreme western verge of the chase, and adjoining a wild tract of semi-cultivated moorland—disdaining to seek refuge in the recesses of the devious woodland, had broken covert gallantly, as the first crash of deep-mouthed music burst from his stanch pursuers; and clearing by a gigantic effort the rough park-palings, had taken to the open country, crossing hill and dale in a line scarce less direct than the crow's flight, and at a pace that, ere an hour had passed, reduced the number of those who followed the now mute and panting hounds from a score or two of fearless horsemen to a scant half-dozen of the boldest and best-mounted riders. The ladies of the party had long since been thrown out, scarcely indeed having cantered a half mile along the nearest road, after the hounds had left the confines of the park; but still the foremost of the field, with all the hair-brained courage of a boy, and all the deep sagacious foresight of a veteran sportsman, rode old Sir Henry Ardenne; his manly features flushed with the excitement of his healthful exercise, and his gray hair floating in the current of air created by his own swift motion, as, cap in hand, he cheered the laggards of the pack with a voice that had lost nothing of its full-toned roundness. At length, in a sequestered dell, clothed on each hand with a dense growth of underwood feathering its rocky and precipitous declivities, down which a sandy road wound in short toilsome curves, and watered by a bright and brawling rivulet, hard pressed and weary, the brave quarry turned to bay. The deep note of the leading hound changed to a shrill and savage treble as he viewed his prey, and at the same instant the loud death-halloo rang from the exulting lips of the old baronet as he caught and comprehended the import of that sharp yell. Another minute brought him to the brink of a wide pool, embayed between rough cliffs of sandstone, and overlooked by a gnarled and leafless oak, on the highest branch of which a solitary raven sat, unmoved by the fierce clamour, and expecting, with a sullen croak, its share of the after-carnage. In the farther corner of this basin, clear as the virgin crystal in its ordinary state, but turbid now and lashed to foam by the wild conflict of the animals, the stag had turned on his pursuers —nor had he turned in vain; for one, a brindled bloodhound, the boldest of the pack, unseamed Vol. I.—G from shoulder-blade to brisket by a thrust of the terrible brow-antler, lay underneath his stamping hoofs a lifeless carcass; while others bayed at a distance, reluctant, as it seemed, again to rush upon an enemy who had already left such painful evidences of his strength and valour on their gored and trampled limbs. Nor, though his velvet coat was clogged and blackened with the dust and sweat, and though the big tears—tokens of anguish in its expression wellnigh human—rolled down his hairy cheeks, did he exhibit aught of craven terror at the approach of his inveterate pursuers; but, as the veteran advanced upon him, with the glittering wood-knife bared and ready, leaving the dogs, as if beneath his notice, he dashed with a bold spring against his human persecutor, eye, hoof, and horn, in perfect concert of quick movement. The slightest tremour in the huntsman's nerves, the most trifling slip or stumble, might have well proved fatal; but, although seventy winters had shed their snows upon his head, his muscles had been indurated so by constant exercise in his beloved field-sports, that many a younger arm had failed in rivalling their powerful though unelastic firmness. When the despairing deer made his last effort, cluding by a rapid turn his formidable front, Sir Henry struck a full blow as he passed, completely severing the tendons of the hinder leg— hamstrung and crippled, the gallant brute plunged headlong forward, and received in the next instant the keen point in his gullet—one short gurgling bleat, and two or three convulsive struggles of the agile limbs—the full eye glazed, and in a moment all the fiery energy, the bounding life, that had so rately animated that beautiful form, was utterly extinct for ever. Then came the thundering shouts, and the long cadences of the French horns, their joyous notes multiplied by the ringing echoes, and sent back from every heath-clad knoll or craggy eminence,—the merry narrative of harmless accidents,—the self-congratulations of the select and lucky few, who, from the start to the death, had kept the hounds in view,—the queries for the absent,—the praises of some favourite horse or daring rider,—the stingless raillery,—the honest unfeigned laughter! “Who hath seen Ardenne? What chance hath hindered Edgar?” suddenly inquired one of the younger of the party. “Edgar not here!” exclaimed his father, for the first time discovering his absence; “Edgar not here! 'Fore George! but he must bide the jest for this!” “'Tis strange, Sir Henry—passing strange, though!” interposed an old gray-headed forester. “None here can match the master's horsemanship; and that brown mare hath the pace in her, and the bottom too. Pray Heaven he be not hurt.” “I fear he may—I fear he may be hurt,” exclaimed another. “He was beside me just before we crossed the northern road. I marked him charge the Hartley burn right gallantly, and noticed the mare's stride—nigh thirty feet, I warrant it.” In a moment or two the wonder had increased until it might be called anxiety—excitement—the more so, as at intervals the laggards of the chase came straggling in, with mud-stained garb and jaded horses; yet none brought tidings of the absent cavalier. At length, sounding their horns from time to time, they turned their horses' heads toward home, asking for tidings of their missing comrade from every traveller or peasant they en countered. Naught did they learn, however, till they had reached the park, when an unlucky groom, leading his lame and weary hunter by the rein, informed them that the young master had been accosted, as he crossed the great north road, by a passing stranger—a marvellously sour-looking knave, the servant said, with a cropped pate and puritanic garb; that he had curbed his horse to listen to him, and on the receiving of some packet or despatches, he knew not whether, had ridden slowly homeward in deep converse with the bearer. “St. George! and with a puritan!” cried one of the young Outrams, a hair-brained, light-hearted cavalier—“a rascally, starved roundhead!” “He must be strangely altered then, I trow,” muttered the aged huntsman, who perhaps had taught him when a boy to ride so well, “an' he be gone home with a musty beggar—the hounds running breast high, too, o'er the vale of Bardsey!” “Tush! tell me not; he is too true an Ardenne,” cried his father, almost angrily, “that he should e'er consort with base and brutal fanatics, Heaven's curse upon them!” It was true, notwithstanding—the report of the fallen rider—to its most minute particular of circumstance; for as he leaped the fence into the road, and pulled upon his rein to spare his horse's feet on the rough pavement, a strange-looking man —gaunt, grim, and tall, with an affected air of sanctified austerity on his pinched features, wearing his coarse and foxy hair shorn close to the skin, and clipped into small peaks alike unseemly and ridiculous, with a tall steeple-crowned hat, and a sad-coloured doublet, threadbare and travel-worn, presenting altogether an appearance as dissimilar as possible to that of a gentleman—called to him in a pert shrill voice— “Canst tell the distance hence to Woodleigh, the residence of Ardenne—him men call Sir Henry; cumbering their tongues with vain distinctions, titles alike unsavoury and profitless?” “A brief three miles,” frankly returned the cavalier. “But you may spare yourself even that short distance, an' you list. There rides Sir Henry—he on the chestnut horse! I will o'ertake and stop him, an' your business may not tarry!” “Nay, friend,” returned the other, “my call is not with the old, vain-minded, carnal cavalier, but with his son—a godly youth, men say—honest and sanctified! yea, one of the elect—” “A truce to thine impertinence, sir knave!” Edgar replied, in a quick angry tone; “a truce to thine impertinence, an' thou wouldst not receive its wages; nor deem thy fulsome flattery toward myself shall anywise excuse thy ribald scoffing at my father! Begone, sir; tempt me, an' you be wise, no farther!” and he had already touched his mare with the spur in order to regain his place beside the hounds, which had gained on him some two fields' width during the interruption, when the puritan reined his hackney short across the path, crying out in a voice somewhat diminished of its self-importance, “Nay! no offence!” he said; “for if thou be'st the man, 'twere worth thy while to tarry. I am the bearer of a letter! yea, of two letters, for the good youth, Edgar Ardenne. I pray thee to relieve me of the charge.” “Begone, sir! To your duty!” again vociferated Ardenne, in a tone yet sterner than he had used before. “Begone to Woodleigh and await my leisure. When I return, 'twill be, I warrant me, right soon enough to look to these despatches. I know not who should write to me by such a low and scurvy comrade, that I should lose my sport to minister to his convenience!” G 2 “Well, be it as thou wilt,” muttered the puritan; “but, an' John Milton's—worshipful John Milton's letter meet with no better treatment, I had as well wend back again to Huntingdon!” “Milton! ha!” answered Ardenne, who had already moved to some considerable distance before he caught the name; “Milton! why saidst not so before, perverse and insolent? Dally with me no farther, thou wert best, but give at once thy missives, and follow me direct to Woodleigh.” Ere he had finished speaking he received the packets—the one a large and cumbrous parcel, wrapped in a skin of thick discoloured parchment, and fastened by a triple band of flaxen thread, with a huge seal stamped with armorial bearings, charged on a broad municipal escutcheon—the other a small neatly—folded letter of smooth white vellum, secured by a skein of delicate sleave silk and drop of wax impressed with a superb antique—the stern and rigid features of the elder Cato. The former was addressed, with cramped mercantile penmanship, to “Edgar, son of the worshipful Sir Henry Ardenne, knight banneret, and baronet of Woodleigh, nigh to Buxton, in the good shire of Derby, with haste and diligence, post haste!” The latter was directed, in a beautiful but bold and manly hand, “To the noble youth Edgar Ardenne.” This was the first he opened, and a pleasing smile played over his fine features as he perused the well-turned periods of his already celebrated friend. “I much rejoice to hear,”—thus did the letter run—“most excellent and esteemed sir, that you have now accomplished, with no hurt or detriment, your long looked-for return to England; and, what redounds so vastly to your credit, that you have come—weaning your thirsty soul from those delicious draughts of pure Parnassian waters in which you have so bathed of late your fancy, and casting aside your delectation in those Italian cities wherein you have so profited by cultivating high pursuits of literature and conversations of the learned—to turn the complete vis and vigour of your intellect toward the miserable strait in which our native land lies struggling,— `Ut clausus Gyaræ scopulis parvâque Seripho,' a strait so fearful, that she wellnigh has lost, not only the fruition, present and temporal, of her liberties, both civil and religious, but the very hope of their redemption. And yet more earnestly do I rejoice that you are called so suddenly, and with so honourable circumstance, to take your place in that high council of the nation, for which your genius and your talents so excellently do befit you. I would not wish you in so much to ponder on the character and principles of them that have united in this tribute to your worth, if they should be in aught—although good patriots and true—distasteful to your feelings; as on the mighty services you well may be an instrument to render, and on the duty paramount which should enforce you so to render them, in that most glorious and free assemblage on which hangs every hope of England. But, with respect to this, without attending my injunctions; you have an admirable monitor, a very entire and pure guide, in your own sense of right, which to obey is to be virtuous and wise, and in obeying which you shall at once fulfil the wishes of your oppressed and lamentable country, and give the highest pleasure to your well-wisher and friend constantly, John Milton. “From my villa, Aldersgate, Oct. 12, 1641.” The calm deliberation with which the cavalier had opened and applied himself to read the familiar letter of his trusty fellow-traveller, gave way, long ere he had concluded, to manifest and restless eagerness; and if he read it through before he tore asunder the fastenings of the larger packet, it was rather that he hoped within itself to find a clew whereby to solve its mystery, than that he was indifferent to learn what was the nature of the call to which his friend alluded. But when he closed it, still in ignorance of that which it behooved him most to know, his colour went and came, and his heart beat quick as he turned hastily to the sole remaining source of information. The paper that first caught his eye on opening the packet was a fair document, in large clear characters, engrossed on vellum, and purporting to be an invitation from the freeholders of the good town of Huntingdon to Edgar Ardenne, that he would present himself a candidate to fill the seat as member for their borough in the most worshipful the commons House of Parliament, lately made vacant by the untimely death of their regretted and right trusty delegate, Elias Chaloner. The second was a brief explanatory statement, signed by the mayor and several of the leading burghers of the town, assuring him, that all he had to do in order to secure election was to make known to them his willingness to serve in parliament, as no other candidate was in the field; nor, if there were, could any have the smallest chance of coping with success against a nominee so universally admired and approved by every class of voters. No pledge was asked—no line of conduct indicated, to which it was expected that he should adhere—no query hinted at, concerning his attachment to either of the parties, between which the whole of England was at that time divided. They were sufficiently assured, the letter stated, of the integrity, the wisdom, and the constancy of him on whom their choice had fallen; so well assured, that they were perfectly content, without condition specified or question asked, to place their interests, their hopes, their fortunes, and, if need were, their lives, at his disposal. In mute astonishment he read successively these several documents; and still, the more he read, the more his wonder and his doubts increased. That he, who had been absent from the land of his fathers almost from the day on which he first wrote man—that he, unstamped by any public act or private declaration; uncommitted to any party or opinion, nay, undecided, for aught that the world knew, in his own mind as to which cause he should espouse in the approaching contest, foreseen by him as by all men endowed with ordinary prescience of events—that he should be thus summoned, within two weeks of his arrival in his native country, and that without a pledge, to fill a place the most conspicuous to which a private individual can well aspire—that he should be thus eminently trusted, and by men whose very names were strangers to his ears; whose town he had never even entered save as a passing traveller; whose principles, but from the somewhat formal and affected plainness of their style, together with the unseemly garments and austere demeanour of their messenger, he had no means of so much as conjecturing; and who, so far as he could comprehend, must be still more at a loss to judge of the parts or principles of him, to whom they had so confidently offered the representation of their interests, the proxy of their united voices;—all this was indeed sufficiently embarrassing, nay, unaccountable at any time; and the more so at a period when political intrigue and treachery were rife, beyond all precedent, among the men reputed as the leaders in the councils of the nation. That such a call was flattering, and that in a degree not trivial or accustomed, could not be doubted or denied, but while he felt that sweetest, most ennobling of sensations, the conviction that his character was understood and his worth appreciated by his fellow-citizens, mingled with a high consciousness that his eloquence, his learning, and experience might indeed minister not smally to the welfare of his country, Ardenne was yet perplexed, anxious, and doubtful. Nor did it seem that he was destined easily or by any effort of his own to extricate himself from this uncertainty; for when, after musing long and vainly on the import of the letters, he turned for information to the messenger, that worthy, doubtless resenting with all the rancour of a petty mind the merited rebuke of Edgar, wrapped himself up in such a veil of real or pretended dulness as defied every species of cross-examination applied to wring from his fanatic obstinacy the reluctant truth. He had been sent, he said, an hired messenger, to carry certain missives, not to expound enigmas, nor to illuminate the darkness of those whom, it might be, Jehovah had for their sins involved in the dark night of ignorance. He knew not aught of the matter; nor, if he had known, should he have deemed it fitting to reveal that which those worthy persons, his employers, had found it meet to leave uncertain. The burgh of Huntingdon, he answered, when Edgar varied the subject and the manner of his investigation—the burgh of Huntingdon was a true town and godly—its late member, good Elias Chaloner, a man learned beyond his fellows, not in the vain and carnal lore of the idolatrous and God-defying heathen, but in the pure and sanctifying wisdom of the gospel! Of its politics he knew not any thing, nor cared. Some cavaliers there were—debosht rakehelly profligates— such as the Knight of Hinchinbrook, uncle of worthy Master Cromwell, now sitting in the commons house for the right saintly town of Cambridge, and others not a few. But of a truth the citizens, craftsmen, and artisans, ay, and the mayor and council, were pious and God-fearing men, seeking the Lord alway, day and night, in prayer and meditation. For the rest, if it were so that they had summoned Master Ardenne to be their deputy in parliament, verily theirs was the power to do so— ay, and they knew right well the wherefore! They were not men, he trowed, to leap i' the dark and to repent at leisure. If Master Ardenne thought it good to suit himself to this promotion, his, as was very fitting, would be the honour and advancement. If not, the men of Huntingdon would be at little trouble to elect as good if not an abler statesman to represent their voices. In this unsatisfied and dubious state of mind Edgar, with his uncourtly comrade, arrived at the park gates; and, quickening his pace, rode hastily along the noble avenue of elms to the main entrance, flung his rein to a groom, and consigning his companion to the attentions of the gray-headed steward, passed with a hurried and irregular step to his own chamber; there, in undisturbed and silent solitude, to ponder on his singular position. An hour fled by, as with his head propped on his hands, and his eyes fixed on the characters of which his mind however took no note, he racked his brain with almost hopeless efforts to conjecture who might be the secret movers in this matter. That his friend Milton had ever been an ardent votary of liberty, in its most liberal and extended sense—a dreamer of those bright utopian visions concerning perfect commonwealths and absolute equality of man, which, in whatever age or country, never have been—never can be realized—a modeller of constitutions excellent in contemplation, but untested by experience; or, if tested by the self-styled republics, but real aristocracies, of early Rome or earlier Greece, proved only to be fickle, changeful, and unstable, Ardenne well knew;—and often with delighted ears had listened, and with a mind that yielded to the inthralling grandeur of those theoretic dreamings, while it perceived their fallacy, to the deep-souled and burning eloquence with which he loved to advocate his wild but splendid projects. He had moreover heard, that subsequently to his return from Italy, the sage enthusiast had devoted himself with stern and self-denying application to the maintenance of the most rigid puritanic forms of Protestant morality and doctrines against the laxer customs of the Church of England, at that time assimilating itself daily more and more, through the bigoted obstinacy of its reckless monarch, and of that most dangerous of all his counsellors, the haughty and half papish Laud, to the detested ritual and creed of Rome. Nor could he doubt, well as he was informed of the almost inseparable league between puritanism in religion and the love of freedom in the state, that the already celebrated author of “Reformation in England,” and “the Reason of Church Government,” was no less strongly interested in opposition to that extension of prerogative, already stretched to the very verge of absolute and irresponsible autocracy, than his illustrious admirers and associates, Hampden and Pym. Still he could not easily give credence to the fancy, that Milton only—for to him alone, of all those patriots with whom his spirit sympathized so warmly in their devoted struggles in behalf of England's constitution, was he personally or intimately known— should have possessed the power to procure him that untrammelled offer of a seat, which individuals of far greater eminence might have been proud to occupy. Amid these painful meditations too there ran a mingled strain of deeper, because more personal, disquietude—an agonizing apprehension, amounting almost to a certainty, that a seat in parliament, entailing on him, as it necessarily must, the highest of all moral obligations—binding him, with fetters stronger a hundred-fold than the poetic adamant, to the upholding of that cause which his mature unbiased judgment should deem right— must set him on the instant in direct unnatural opposition to his father; and yet worse, must sever him from her whose love he surely prized above all mortal blessings. It was in vain that he attempted to shake off the leaden weight of this dark apprehension—it was to no purpose that hope whispered to his bosom how all might yet be well —it was to no purpose that he strove to reconcile the diverse paths of duty and of pleasure. A dozen times he took his pen in hand to write an answer to the perplexing invitation; and as often threw it from him in utter inability to frame a single sentence. Once, at suggestion of his warmer passions, and yielding to the persuasion of that single grain of selfishness, which must still lurk in every bosom, even of the best and purest, his fingers traced three lines of absolute denial; but, ere the clause was finished, the juster sense returned, and the torn sheet was in an instant shrivelling amid the logs that crackled on the hearthstone. “No, no!” he cried aloud, in the low husky tones which Vol. I.—H tell so fearfully of inward agony. “No, no—my country—never will I betray thee at thine utmost need!—What though my heart be broken in the strife—what though I lose all things that make this earth a paradise and not a hell—what though I perish—or, yet worse, live homeless, friendless, fatherless, deserted—hated by whom I most adore, and cursed by whom I bless—what though I, I, one man and for one little life, must bear all anguish that a life can compass,—shall I for this shrink back, knowing that England needs the voice, the hand, the soul of every son she has, to save her from destruction—to redeem her living millions— her millions yet unborn—from countless centuries of servitude and sorrow! The cup—the cup is filled! God grant me strength to drain it—ay, to the very dregs!” And with a calm unfaltering hand he drew a brief but full acceptance of the trust so proffered to his choice,—pledging himself to act, so long as he should represent their voices, so, and so only, as his own heart should dictate. “I would,” he wrote, “before investing myself with the great and onerous responsibility you wish to impose upon me—I would that you should clearly know and apprehend my principles and rule of action. All party I disclaim—all preconceived opinion from my soul I disavow! To hold the freedom of our land inviolate—of our religion pure, I do esteem the first of duties. But the freedom which I look to—I do pray you mark me now, so shall there be no blame hereafter—is the freedom of our British Constitution, not the licentious anarchy of democratic innovation—and the religion which I will maintain is the religion of my fathers—the reformed church of England, equally aloof from the debasing superstitions of the Romish creed, and from the stern fanaticism of Lutheran or Calvinistic sectaries. If, then, on knowing these my tenets both of church and state, ye make it your election still to go forward in this matter, I shall so labour—with such powers both of mind and body as God in his good wisdom has assigned me—as I may deem the fittest to secure unto ourselves, and unto our posterity for ever, the blessings of a government at once liberal and firm—of a religion pure, no less than tolerant and free. If, on the other hand, ye doubt in aught my motives, or disapprove my principles as stated heretofore—if ye do look that I should yield at any time, or under any circumstance, my own conviction to the opinion or the prejudice of others—even of yourselves, my own constituents—then make at once a fresh selection, choosing a man more suited to your purposes; accepting in meanwhile my high consideration of the honour ye have done me, in thus summoning me, as yet a stranger, to the highest station of your trust.” Scarcely had he concluded his epistle, ere a quick heavy footstep sounded through the corridor —approached his chamber door, and paused beside it, followed by a short firm tap upon the oaken panel. “Now comes the crisis of my fate,” inwardly muttered Ardenne, as, recognising on the instant the footstep of his father, he hurried to admit him. “So studious, Edgar?” cried the veteran; “plunged to your very neck in parchments!—The matter must, I trow, be all-important, that should have won you homeward from such music as was ringing in your ears, when you this morning left us in the Vale of Bardsey! 'Fore George, but he ran gallantly and straight, poor dapple!—turned him to bay in the Witch hollow beneath Leader hill—gored brindled Mortimer to the death ere I came up with him, and hurt some six or eight of the others. What in the fiend's name called you home? What clouds your face even now so darkly? Speak, Edgar, hast ill tidings?” “Not ill, sir, not ill tidings, but of weighty import,” answered Ardenne, as his father threw himself upon a massive settle in the chimney corner; “and such as have urged on me much grave thought ere I might answer them!” and, as he spoke, he tendered to his hand the invitation from the burgh of Huntingdon. “Here, if my visage be o'ercast, here shall you find the cause—and this, when you shall have perused the first, contains my answer.” With deep anxiety did the eye of Edgar dwell upon the keen intelligent features of the aged man, fitfully lighted up by the uncertain gleams from the piled hearth—for evening had crept on them unperceived, and the sky was growing dark apace—as he read the letters by the firelight. Changes there were indeed upon the broad unwrinkled forehead, chasing each other over it in quick succession— now a deep frown corded the muscles of the brow, but more perhaps from the effects of thought than from disgust or anger—anon it was relaxed, and a more bland expression played around the mouth, and the full open eye shone cheerfully. Again the glance was clouded, and the lip curled in scorn, till every hair of his mustache worked as it were instinct with life. “The roundhead scurvy villains!” he exclaimed at length, striking the extended parchment forcibly with the forefinger of his right hand; “the base mechanical burghers!—I marvel they should dare pollute a gentleman's ear with their accursed puritanic cant. You have refused them, Edgar—indignantly hurled back their most insulting proffer in their teeth! Is it not so?—now, on your life, say ay!” “I see it not in this light, sir,” Edgar replied, respectfully but firmly; “I see it not at all in this light—nor is there aught, to my poor comprehension, either of cant or insult in this invitation.” “Doubtless you have accepted it—this flattering invitation!” interrupted the old man, with an expression of the most bitter irony; “doubtless you have!” “I have accepted it,” calmly returned his son; “I have indeed accepted it, nor can I possibly conceive—” “You have not, Edgar Ardenne,” his father almost shouted, as he sprang to his feet, spurning the footstool from beneath them to the farther corner of the room; “you have not dared to do so! You! you! an Ardenne—heir to some twenty generations of high-minded, noble, loyal cavaliers —you blend yourself with the foul puddle blood of craftsmen and pinched beggarly mechanics—you band yourself with hypocrites and traitors against your church, your country, and your king!—No, no!—it can not be!” “Indeed! indeed! it could not,” replied Edgar, in tones almost femininely soothing; “indeed it could not be, that I should ever mix myself with aught degenerate or base, much less with aught unprincipled or traitorous. But, of a truth, my father, I apprehend not any thing—though straining to the utmost of my understanding—I apprehend not any thing here written to imply aught that can by any means be tortured into treason or fanaticism. Nay, for my part, I find not aught that would restrain me, if I should be so minded, from degrading loyalty, even as the member for this very borough, into most prostrate oriental slavishness—from bartering our reformed religion for Romish superstition! A seat is proffered to me freely—without condition, pledge, or hint of any H 2 interference. Nay! the constituents aver that they refer themselves in all things to my judgment —submit themselves to absolute dictation of my individual will. Now, sir, it seems to me—I pray you so far pardon me as to permit me speak to the end—it seems to me, if—as I see no cause to deem them such—these men of Huntingdon be fanatics and traitors, there cannot be a better mode of frustrating their ill intentions, than that I, who most assuredly am neither, should accept their offer, and represent their bigoted and treasonable voices by a most tolerant and patriotic vote!” Sir Henry's passions had displayed their progress on his features during his son's rejoinder even more strongly and with more definite changes than before. At the first, every line and feature was inflamed almost to bursting with fierce and fiery indignation—varying as Edgar proceeded to that air of obstinate unwilling coolness with which a man resigns himself to some infliction which he may not avoid. Then, as the truth of what was said impressed itself by slow degrees upon his senses, he listened with attention approaching somewhat to respect, till, when the last sentence fell upon his ear, and he fancied that the full policy of his son was there disclosed to him, the mighty satisfaction flashed from his whole face as he exclaimed— “Excellent! I was dull indeed! excellent! Edgar; and so `hoist the knave engineers, e'en with their own petard!' 'Fore George but you surpass, not your old father's talents only—that you did ever—but his uttermost wishes! And so, when the fool puritans would have you rob the church and manacle the king, vote like a loyal cavalier!—Now out on me for an old superannuated dolt that would not hear or comprehend!” “Nay, sir; but even now,” said Edgar, not a little astonished by this ebullition of mistaken pleasure—“even now you do misapprehend me somewhat. I have accepted this same seat in the Commons, giving the men of Huntingdon to know that I will hold myself responsible to no authority save that of my own conscience. Party, or place, I hold not to, nor covet. In all high honour and in all accordance with my own sense of just and right, will I vote ever!—If these men should dare propose to me, or hint that I should swerve one hair-breadth from the course of truth and honour—then would I surely disobey them—spit at them, and spurn them. But, if they should prove honest, as surely will I compromise no tittle of their interests or their opinions; and so far am I from suspecting aught of this, that I do well believe that my constituents will prove right honest men and true—else, under favour be it spoken, I deem it most unlikely they should have fixed their choice on me—a man perhaps not altogether void of some repute of honour, and—if unknown myself—at least a scion of a family that has not ever stooped to fraud or to disgrace!” “Enough said! Edgar; enough said! I was a fool to doubt thee;” and the old man grasped his hand with warm affection as he answered, while a tear slid down his withered cheek; “I was a fool to doubt thee—for thou wert ever true and noble, as I was ever over-choleric and rash. Some things too, in good sooth, there are, that might be well amended! This ship-money I like not altogether—nor these violent forced subsidies—yet less like I the sordid puritanic knaves who do oppose them, not that they know or understand the evil of the measures which they rail at, but that they would embarrass and annoy, and, if their means were mated to their will, perchance o'erturn the government from which those measures emanate—not that they love their country, but that they hate their king—because, being base themselves, they loathe the very name of what is high, or generous, or noble—because, having naught to lose even in England's ruin, they may gain all in the midst of uproar and confusion. But enough said!—you shall receive their offer, since so you will it, although I hold a promise of a borough from my Lord of Middleton awaiting your acceptance, for which—I speak it in all candour— I would far rather have you member than for this beggarly psalm-singing body corporate of Huntingdon. But enough said!—Bear with me, Edgar, for I am old, and choleric withal, and hasty! And now to supper! For John, cook, will be foaming an his goosepie be burnt, or his beef boiled to rags —as with o'erflowing eyes he swore to me they were last night, and all through fault of mine!” CHAPTER VI. “'Tis hard to part— When youthful hearts with treasured dreams are high Of sunny days, and calmest nights serene,— A happy future!—but on harder far, When dark anticipation veils the scene With melancholy clouds, and hard at hand Sits chill despair—that vulture of the soul— Watching the latest gleam of hope expire To pounce her conscious prey.” Time journeyed onward—and with a flight as rapid, when every day and hour was charged with tidings of some great event, with some terrific rumour, or some perilous foreboding, as though it had ebbed noiselessly away in peace and in obscurity. The golden days of autumn had already flown— the last slow wain had dragged its freight to the piled threshing-floor—the last flower had shed its petals scentless and colourless upon the frosted grass. The leaves, that had for many weeks clothed grove and forest in a rich garb of many-coloured splendour, now detached themselves one by one from the sere branches, and fell whirling slowly in the heavy atmosphere, like hopes blighted before accomplishment, to the dank steamy earth—the glimpses of the sun were rarer and more pallid than their wont, and often in the depth of night the mighty winds went forth, wailing as if in sorrow over the faded glories of the year. Nor were the signs of the times less gloomy than the tokens of the season. All England was in confusion and dismay, and both these hourly increasing, till the one half of the people was wellnigh maddened by its fears, the other by the excitement of its own fierce and stormy passions. To-day a rumour was abroad of mighty armaments levied beyond the sea; and even now preparing to pollute with foreign weapons the free soil of England, and to erect the power of her monarch, already stretched beyond all limits of constitutional sway, into absolute and self-controlling tyranny. On the next, a tale was rife that Pym, the champion of the people's cause and king of their affections, had been assailed, perhaps even murdered, by the hired emissaries of a sovereign stern and cold by nature, and rendered merciless and cruel by the extremity of terror. Then came the one great accusation, swallowing up in its atrocity all lesser charges, all inferior crimes, as the sunshine drinks up and blots from heaven the fainter lustre of the stars!—The one great accusation, at that time generally credited by men of every class except perhaps a few of the most confiding and most generous cavaliers—and since those days confirmed almost beyond the possibility of doubt—that the Irish rebellion, with all its horrible features of midnight massacre and midday conflagration, was the premeditated, coolly calculated, work of Charles and Henrietta! The one great accusation, penetrating every breast, in every rank of persons, with mingled sentiments of pity, horror, hatred, and disgust; imbittering still more against him the foes of the misguided sovereign, and alienating from his side many of those devoted and enthusiastic spirits, that never would have swerved from their allegiance, so long as they had sense or being, had he but shown himself in the most trivial circumstances constant, not to his faithful servants, but to his own true interests, or even to himself. In the Commons house the minds of men were even more unsettled than in the world at large—parties ran daily higher, and with a greater share of virulence and private animosity than at any previous period; and, indeed, it seemed that the king himself was labouring as earnestly to the advantage of his enemies, the puritans, as they themselves could wish. At the first meeting of the parliament, a committee had been appointed “to draw up a general remonstrance of the state of the kingdom, and the particular grievances it had sustained;” which, after its first nomination, had, however, scarcely ever met, and was almost forgotten. But now, during the causeless and protracted absence of the ill-fated monarch in the sister kingdom—irritated by his apathy with regard to bleeding Ireland—appreciating fully his dishonest motives in lingering at a distance from his parliament—and goaded almost to madness by his attempt to seize or to assassinate, as many did in truth believe, Argyle and Hamilton—the party came to the resolve of reproducing that momentous question; and, in accordance with their views, upon Strode's motion, it was carried, that “the committee of remonstrance be revived, and ordered without more delay to meet;” and time and place incontinently were appointed. Within a few days of this measure, a bill of far more questionable character, and justified alone—if it might any way be justified—by the unwonted and most unbecoming violence of the spiritual lords, who lent themselves in every instance as willing instruments to aid the usurpation of the sovereign, and scrupled not to violate the spirit and the letter of the laws against the Romish church—was introduced, ordered by a majority of voices to be read, and, without any opposition worthy of remark, transmitted to the lords, for the disabling the bishops from the exercise of voting in the upper house, or of any temporal office throughout the kingdom. Just at this critical and anxious juncture, with his accustomed rashness and inveterate obstinacy, Charles deemed it fitting to collate five preachers of undoubted eminence and learning, but known as well for principles of state the most obnoxious as for their talents, to as many sees vacant by death or by translation—in absolute defiance, as it seemed, to the desires of the popular branch of legislation, and contrary to the advice of his most trustworthy and valuable counsellors. In the midst of the tumults—for to an extent which scarcely can be designated by a less forcible word was the violent struggle carried between the upper and the lower houses—consequent upon this doubtful measure, tidings arrived in London, that on a day appointed, having arranged all matters in that kingdom to the general satisfaction, his majesty intended to depart from Scotland on his homeward progress; and straightway the committee offered the report of their proceedings, together with a draught of the remonstrance, to the house; which instantly, although divided much in sentiment, and, as many thought, in general opposed to this decisive stroke, proceeded to discuss it with a degree of bitterness and fury perhaps unprecedented except in the debates upon the case of Strafford. In the meanwhile an answer had been returned to Ardenne by his constituents of Huntingdon, agreeing fully to the terms he had proposed, whereon to serve them in the Commons as their representative and member; and urging him, so soon as it might be consistent with his leisure, to betake himself to London; there to assume his seat. All preparations had been made for his departure; chambers secured for him in Westminster; his retinue and horses sent before him; nay, even a day fixed whereon again to leave, after so brief enjoyment of its serene and tranquil pleasures, his paternal home. He felt not, it is true, that terrible sensation of passionate and overwhelming sorrow which drowns the hearts of the young at their first setting forth into the wide and cheerless world, from the dear roof that saw their birth!—much less that sullen and collected bitterness with which the exile gazes, ere he turn from them for ever, upon the scenes never before so beautiful or so beloved!—but he did feel a heavy and continual gloom clouding, he knew not wherefore, all his anticipations of the future—an ominous and all-engrossing sense of coming evil—a prophetic fear, that it would ne'er be his again to cast away the burden of his sorrows, and be, as it were, once again a child in spirit, beside that old domestic hearth—a fear not justified, perhaps, by any clear perception, nor founded upon any evidence of judgment; but still oppressing his mind, no less than the influence of a coming thunder-storm is often seen to agitate the lower grades of animal creation, when not a speck of cloud is visible as yet above the clear horizon. As far indeed as regarded any real or well-founded apprehensions, Ardenne had every following day less cause to dread a rupture with his father in consequence of any difference in politics; for so completely had the old man taken up the notion that his son intended to apply his nomination by the puritanic party to the advancement of the royal interests, that Edgar fruitlessly endeavoured to apprize him of the error, and to convince him of his own sincerity and singleness of purpose. “Right! right! boy,” he would cry; “never betray your counsel!—and in good sooth thou hast a perilous part to play, and a politic—best vote a few times with the canting knaves—so better to throw dust i' their eyes, that they discover not thy game ere it be fit time to disclose it, husbanding so thy powers as to aid our gracious master in his real straits, an' it should come—which God avert— to such an issue!” For a time, indeed—so utterly abhorrent was the smallest shadow of deception to his ingenuous mind and rigid sense of honour—he strenuously and sincerely strove to make Sir Henry comprehend his principles—his entire devotion to the laws and constitution of his country, as established by the precedent of ages, not as interpreted by the corrupt and pensioned lawyers of the court—his firm attachment to the privilege of Parliament, as opposed to the prerogative of the crown—and, over all, his absolute disgust at the late proceedings taken by the king in relation to the claim of ship-money especially, and to the infringement of Vol. I.—I the anti-Catholic statutes;—but finding all endeavours vain to overturn his preconceived opinion, he abandoned altogether the ungracious task, in an uncertain state of mind, bordering at one moment on hope, at another on its opposite extreme, despair; arguing within himself, when brighter thoughts prevailed, that, as his father's violence of loyalty was even now so greatly modified as to permit him to allow the participation of corrupt men, and the existence of evil measures, in the councils of his kingly idol, his own course might so far tally with his views, or, at the worst, might differ from them only in so small particulars as to call forth no very strenuous or lasting reprobation;—and again, when giving way to gloomier though perhaps more probable imaginations, foreseeing that the obstinate determination of the sovereign to dispense with parliaments; to recognise the laws of the land but so far as they should further his own imperious wishes; to rule, in short, as an absolute and arbitrary monarch—and the noble stand assumed by the delegates of the people in defence of the people's rights—would by no means ever be composed or reconciled except by arbitration of the sword; and farther, that in such a case, as certainly as he should be himself found warring in the ranks of freedom, so surely would Sir Henry arm to buckler the time-hallowed names of church and king, although the former should be almost Romish, and the latter utterly despotic. Thus was the mind of Edgar balanced during the interval which elapsed between his first acceptance of the proffered honour and his departure for the metropolis—its moods as various as the changes of an April day, now bright with sunshiny and azure skies, now blackened with the scudding rack, and howling with the stormy gusts. The days, however, wore onward—the chase in the morning, with its heart-stirring sounds and high associations, or the stroll through the highly-cultivated grounds about the homestead, or the familiar visit to the independent yeomen or the sturdy peasantry, consumed the earlier hours; and, when the mid-day meal was ended, the ramble in the beautiful broad park, beneath the autumnal trees, with his sweet cousin—the ramble, finished, as it seemed to them, almost before it was commenced—beguiled the hours till twilight, when the lamps would all be lighted, and the guests assembled in the lordly hall, or the smaller circle gathered about the parlour fire, to cheat the evening with lay and legend, or with sprightly converse, more pleasantly than with loud minstrelsey and the gay dance. The days, however, wore onward—and although none else perceived the constant cloud that dwelt on Edgar's brow, Sibyl had marked and understood it; and, as if in sympathy, her own transparent skin showed less and less the healthful hues of her elastic blood—and her deep eye was always dimmer than its wont, and often tearful, as it would dwell unnoticed on the overshadowed features of her lover, now constantly absorbed, as he had rarely been of yore, in fits of meditation, abstracting him entirely from the business or the pleasure of the moment. After the morning following his return to Woodleigh, although on other topics there had been no reserve however trivial, no hesitancy or concealment of action, thought, or motive, neither had again alluded to the subject of their interrupted conversation—he shunning it, not merely because he could have naught agreeable, but because he had naught definite which to communicate, and therefore was unwilling, needlessly perhaps, to cloud her prospects with certainly a distant, and not improbably a causeless, terror!—and she not pressing it, because, relying with a pure and holy confidence upon her promised husband—a confidence inferior only to her trust in her Creator!—because seeing, that, be his secret sorrow what it might, he felt it not his duty at that time to impart it to her ear!— and because she would have scorned herself could she have entertained the thought but for a moment of obtaining that from his fondness, which his judgment would not warrant his bestowing! It was not long, however, before Sibyl had another and a surer reason for her silence; for, with that wondrous shrewdness which a woman's heart possesses in divining and discovering any thing that may affect it in its own particular province, she fancied herself ere long to be the mistress of the causes of his hidden grief. She saw the struggle in his heart between his love for her and for his father, and his devotion to his country. She knew that in the heart of such a man the struggle could last but for a single hour ere it must be decided—she suffered no diminution of her self-respect, no fretting of her vanity, as she acknowledged that her own claims to his affection must surely yield to the overruling amor patriœ—and, while she sorrowed with the deep sincerity of a true and loving heart over the election which, she was assured, he had already made, she yet thought she hardly could desire that he had decided otherwise!—And even yet there was another cause!— a lingering hope—that she might yet have been in error—that she might falsely have interpreted the outward workings of his mind—a fear of banishing that lingering hope, by questioning of that which she most yearned to know—a dread of learning that, which even now almost knowing true, she would have given worlds to know unreal. The days wore onward, and the last morning broke, and the last sun arose, which was to shine on Edgar a dweller in his father's house. It was a clear, bright, cheerful morning—a slight touch of frost on the preceding evening had imparted just enough of coldness to the atmosphere to render it more pure and bracing, but the sun shone warmly out, and the dew sparkled laughingly upon the shrubs and grass, and the rooks clove the liquid firmament with their exulting wings at an immeasurable pitch—all nature seeming to rejoice with a more healthful and elastic joy than in the fullest flush of summer. It was, in short, just such a morning as would make the careless and unburdened heart sit lightiler on its throne—as would impel the mounted traveller to give his horse the spur, and let his spirits loose by a free and fearless gallop—as would swell the pedestrian's chest, and plant his stride more firmly on the sod, and perchance unclose his lips with something of a song— but it was such a one withal as would cause one departing from some loved and lovely scene, to need a stronger effort to tear himself away than he would have been called on to exert had the skies been lowering, and the day in nearer unison with his own sad sensations. Accordingly, the tone of Edgar's feelings were depressed beyond their wont, even as the aspect of all visible things was fairer than the promise of the season—his mien was careworn, and at times it scarcely would have been too strong a term to call it haggard—his gait was various and irregular, hasty at times and hurried, and at times unusually slow—his eye was often fixed on vacancy, and those who would address him were compelled to speak their wishes more than once ere they appeared to reach his understanding. The earlier hours were consumed in I 2 preparations till high noon came round, and he sat down to the last meal he was for many a month to taste in fellowship with those who sat beside him, while the unwelcome thought would still intrude itself, that it might be verily the last. In silence then, if not in sorrow, dinner went by, until the board was cleared of all save cup and flagon, and the old servitors withdrew, and Sibyl vanished—to attend, perchance, her household duties, or, more probably, to give in private vent to the gushing feelings which she in public was compelled to smother—and sire and son were left without companions. For a while the old man spoke not, resting his head upon his hand as if in anxious thought; and, although once or twice he raised it and made as if about to speak, he yet seemed at a loss for words—at length, as if with something of an effort, he aroused himself, filled up his goblet from the stoop of Bordeaux wine before him, and, pushing it toward his son, motioned that he should follow the example—gazed for a moment wistfully upon the clouded features that met his eye, and with a nod and smile that vainly struggled to be lightsome, emptied his winecup. “Come, Edgar, come!” he said, “this gloom will never do!—Cheer up, kind heart, cheer up!— Thou takest on more sadly now methinks than when thou left us for thy three years term of service in the Low Countries! but I can see how sits the wind—old though I be, and past these toys this many a winter's day—I mind when I was a young cavalier, and not—although I say it who should not—the most unlikely in the court of good Queen Bess, we ne'er shall look upon her like again—I mind how I was wont to droop at parting from—poor Alice!—Sibyl, though passing fair, is naught for beauty to what she was!—Well—too well! do I mind it.” Ardenne, who had shaken off his air of abstraction for a moment as his father drank to him, was again relapsing into the same listless mood on perceiving that his words were rather unconnected musings than such as called for answer or remark —but when the name of Sibyl caught his ear, his eye lightened, and the colour rushed to his brow, as he perceived that his inmost thoughts were about to be subjected to the keen probe of mental surgery! “Ay! ay! I can see plain enough how sits the wind,” continued Sir Henry, without pausing for a reply; “though why you should be so cast down, I may not comprehend so readily. Your cousin Sibyl, I do know right well, has long possessed your love, and as long too returned it. That I have in all things approved of this, I need not tell you now, seeing that you must well conceive, that knowing this and not prohibiting was to all needful ends consenting. That you should be cast down at leaving of so sweet a girl as Sibyl, is—I gainsay it not—right natural; nathless I cannot but imagine that you do apprehend some greater evil than a mere temporary separation. Now, boy, to the point!—You would espouse your cousin Sibyl—she says not nay!—and if my interference be a cause of dread to you, I say but this, that you have cruelly misjudged your father's heart! My benison on you both! I know no sweeter balm for all the manifold griefs of age, than to make, and to see, the youthful happy. So set your soul at ease—brave boy—you shall wed Sibyl when you will; and the more quickly—the more gladly and more surely shall I witness it. You start for Westminster to-night; and I have meditated somewhat often now of late on passing this next Christmas-tide in London. Sibyl, poor child, hath seen naught of court-gayety nor of the world as yet, and this is but a lonesome place in winter—the more so now that half the gentles of the land will, as it seems too likely, be detained till spring in the city by these protracted sittings of the Houses, which men speak of. I have determined now to give you a commission—choose me a fitting mansion— whether to rent or purchase I care not a maravedi —in the Strand if thou mayst, if not in Westminster or Charing!—see it right nobly furnished, and write me when 'tis done. I will bring Sibyl thither straightway, and, sith you may not spend these holydays with us, why we will keep them up with you, I warrant me. And now away to Sibyl; say to her all that I have said to you, and what beside seems fitting to your melancholy mood. Thou needst not me, I trow, to woo her. Fix, if you may prevail on her, your bridal day at once— whene'er ye list, 'twixt Christmas-tide and Easter. Be happy, Edgar, be happy, and let me see you so—such is my only wish this side eternity,—before I go to my long home.” “My good—my generous—my gracious father!” cried Ardenne, affected to the point of weeping, as he threw himself upon the old man's neck; “too good! too generous!” “Tush! tush, boy!—None of this!” exclaimed the veteran, hemming away the husky weakness from his throat; “none of this—but away with you to Sibyl—she is more fitting object for these raptures than an old weather-beaten trunk like me. Away with you! but hark ye—here is the ring that plighted my departed angel. Let me behold it on her hand, whom I have loved the best—nay, I might say, the only one—of women, since my own Alice left me, to drag out my pilgrimage alone, without one hope to cheer it save that of meeting her once more, when it shall be, O Lord, thy merciful and blessed will.” It would have been of no avail—so bent was the old knight on his benevolent design—it would have been of no avail, even had Edgar been so minded, to strive to alter or oppose his projects. They were not such, however, as to leave a possible desire to his son, which would not be, by their accomplishment, at once achieved. He had no words to answer—but the hot blood rushed tumultuously through his veins—and his strong frame quivered visibly with the excitement of his spirits, as he hurried from the hall to seek his beautiful betrothed. “Once mine, and all beside is nothing! once mine, there will be no more struggle! Duty and pleasure will go hand in hand! Once wedded, and no difference of opinion then may put those asunder whom God has joined together!” Such were the thoughts that thronged with irresistible impetuosity, and with the speed of light, upon his busy brain—but he had not made six steps beyond the threshold before reflection changed the prospect. “Would it be noble—honourable—upright” —thus did he commune with himself; “would it be worthy of an Ardenne—the supporter of an unblotted fame of generations—nay, rather, would it not be sordid—base—dishonest—and degrading to the lowliest gentleman, to win a credulous confiding woman by a fraud—by an implied, if not a spoken, lie?—To let her wed, believing him she wedded a supporter of the cause she deemed most holy, a soldier armed for the warfare which alone to her seemed just and sacred—to let her wed in haste, and then find out at leisure that she had been deceived—vilely deceived—by him she had just sworn to honour?—Not so!” he cried aloud, “It shall not be, by Heaven! She shall know all —all—every thing! Knowing, she shall accept my hand—or knowing, cast me off, but not at least —despise me!” And, as his mind arrived at its mature though swift conclusion, he reached the door of Sibyl's oriel parlour—with a hesitating hand he struck the panel, and so slight was the sound that it conveyed no tidings to the inmate— at least it was unanswered—again he knocked, and louder than before—he listened, and still all was silence. Supposing her he sought to have gone forth, he had already turned away to follow her, when a faint noise, as of a person breathing heavily, or perhaps gently weeping, attracted his attention; he knocked a third time, and then— though still unbidden—entered. She was within —she was alone!—in the prostration—in the absolute abandonment of feminine and hopeless grief! Her face was buried in her hands, as she lay stretched at length on the broad pillowed settle which encircled the bay window. Her light brown hair, which had broken loose from the confinement of her silken headgear, flowed in redundant waves over the voluptuous outline of her shoulders, trailing down even to the ground. Her features were, of course, concealed; but the large pearly tears, forcing their way one by one between her fingers, had already left a visible trace of moisture on the damask cushions, while the convulsive starts that agitated her entire frame told even more the depth and anguish of her sorrow than all her weeping. “Sibyl,” he whispered, stealing with noiseless steps over the three-piled Persian carpet till he was close beside her; “my own—own Sibyl!” there was a deep fond pathos in his musical accents which no description could express—a liquid, melancholy tenderness, that sank directly to the heart; “My own—own Sibyl.” And with the most respectful delicacy he lifted her from her recumbent attitude; “and weeping too for me! but weep no longer, dearest one—I come—I come! Oh grant it, God, that it may be so—to wipe those tears away—to make you mine—for ever!” She gazed upon him for a second's space, wildly—distrustfully—then, as she perceived his earnest air, and marked the hope that kindled in his smile—then brighter thoughts prevailed; and with the sudden strange revulsion, abandoning herself to the full tide of her warm, passionate feelings, she sank half fainting on the bosom of her lover. “Oh grant it, Father of all mercies—grant it, that this too mighty treasure shall indeed be mine!” he murmured fervently, as he supported her, and with considerate expressions of calm fondness recalled her gradually to her self-possession, suppressing every sentiment that might embarrass her returning consciousness—that might in any wise offend or agitate her girlish sensibilities; holding her hand in his the while, but with a quiet, unimpassioned pressure, liker to the expression of a kind brother's love than to the rapturous devotion of a youthful suiter; soothing her with the gentlest tones of his familiar voice, till she was at the least sufficiently composed to listen to his self-restrained and self-accusing pleadings. “Sibyl,” he said at length, as her deeply-drawn sighs subsided, and her tears ceased to flow in such unnatural profusion; “Sibyl—dear cousin; soon—soon, I trust, to be addressed by a far dearer title, I have much—much that I would say to you before I go from hence, never unless at your permission to return!—much from my father—for myself yet more!—Dry your tears, dearest, dry them, I beseech you—it is agony to me to look on them!—dry them, and listen to me, that we may, if it be Heaven's pleasure, be happy as the happiest of earth's inhabitants.” “Say on,” she difficultly faltered forth the words, “say on, dear Edgar—with my whole soul I do attend you.” “Not here,” he answered, “not here, sweet one —and not yet! But do your mantle on, and walk forth with me for a little space. You are too greatly agitated yet, calmly to hear, and freely to decide on that, which, for your happiness'—for your life's—sake, you must consider warily and well! The pleasant sunshine, the fresh grateful air, and, above all, the peaceful and quiescent scenery, will tranquillize your mind. Moreover, I would not that this sun should set unwitnessed by us twain together. You will go forth, then, dearest—will you not, Sibyl?” A smile, exquisitely sweet, glancing from out her tears, was her sole token of assent, as she disengaged herself half blushingly from his supporting arms, and, gathering her dishevelled tresses, folded them simply, but in the most perfect taste, around her classically moulded temples. “Wait for me in the vestibule,” she said—“I will be there ere you shall have the time to miss me;” and vanished from the room, leaving a stronger hope in Ardenne's breast than he had entertained for many a day. He was assured in his own mind, beyond the possibility of doubt, that she had marked the secret conflict of his soul, that she had penetrated his sole mystery, and was aware already of his apprehensions, as to the part which it might ere long be his duty to sustain, whether it should lie in the grave and subtle forum, or in the lamentable field of civil strife; and he now listened to the flattering voice within, which whispered that it might well be, a maiden so affectionate, so warm, and, above all, so deeply and devotedly attached, would overlook the difference in their political creeds, as counterbalanced, rendered nugatory, and a thing of naught, by their entire harmony of soul on every other subject. It might well be, that one so strong herself in principles of honour and integrity, would find more to admire in the inflexible and stern uprightness which will not sacrifice one particle of conscience—one straw's bulk of that which it considers duty—before the shrine of its most intimate and near affections, than to rebuke or reprobate in the opinions or the principles on which that duty hinges. But he had not long time to waste in thought or speculation; for, as he reached the entrance of the hall, the form he loved so well to look upon came gliding down the staircase, wrapped in her walking-robe—fitted above the waist with accurate precision to the mould of her unrivalled shape, but full below and flowing—of dark velvet, furred at the cape and cuffs with the most costly minever; and wearing on her head a cap of ermine, its silken crown and lining protruding from above the border of deep fur, and hanging gracefully down, with a white ostrich-feather drooping over it, so as to flush one delicate cheek more warmly than its sister with a teint borrowed from its own bright crimson. With a passionate and fitful light, far different from the calmness of their wonted radiance, the eyes of Edgar dwelt upon the finely-modelled person, and the features, not the less exquisitely fair that they now wore a melancholy, downcast aspect, of her, on whose acceptance or denial of his present suit his all of hope was fearfully suspended. So long, indeed, and Vol. I.—K evident was that fixed gaze of admiration, and so much was she pained by its expression, that the bashful blood rushed like a torrent to brow, cheek, and neck, with blushes scarcely natural, so vivid was their hectic colour. Perceiving instantly the cause of her confusion, with an air of deep humility he lowered his offending eyes, and, as he took her hand to lead her forth, “Pardon,” he whispered, in low, reverential tones—“pardon me, gentle cousin, my most unwitting and involuntary fault!—if fault it be—” he added, with a voice that faltered, and then abruptly paused, as if he were unable to complete the sentence. A quiet pressure of the fingers that yet lingered in his tender grasp, replied at once, and reassured him; and in the silence caused by feelings or by thoughts too powerful for utterance—how widely different from that of apathy or dulness!—they for the last time wandered forth into the pleasant solitudes of the broad sylvan chase. Throughout the greater part of its extent, this ornamented tract, although diversified enough by change of dale and upland to redeem its beauties from the charge of tameness or monotony, was rather of a level than a broken character; its charms were chiefly of that tranquil and composing cast which is found rather in expanses of deep meadow-land, carpeted by a sward so fresh and so luxuriant as to lose little of its verdure even in the dead months of winter—in the massive foliage of the scattered clumps, or more continuous groves of stately timber-trees—and in the sheets of limpid but unrippled water, than in the features of a scenery, which, if more romantic, is far less alluring; if more enchanting to the first astonished glance, bears not so well the test of daily and familiar observation. Towards its northern and northwestern boundaries, however, the ground was swelling and uneven; the hills heaved up more boldly from the valleys, which were in places so abrupt and narrow as almost to deserve the name of glens, or dingles, and often wore a coronet of gray and rifted sandstone above the purple heather, that clothed their flanks with a dark russet mantle wheresoever the soil was too poor or too shallow to support the taller growth of hazel, birch, and mountain ash, which clustered round their bases, or straggled up their sides where any casual streamlet had worn a channel to protect them from the western gales, and afforded by its waters a grateful although scanty nutriment to their dwarfed and thirsty roots. Imbosomed in these rugged eminences, at a short mile's distance from the manor, there lay a little tarn or mountain lake, scarce larger than an artificial pool, but so deep that its glassy waters shone black as polished jet even beneath the azure skies of June. Narrow, however, as it was, it yet could boast its islets—two, fringed from the water's edge with tangled underwood, above which waved some three or four tall trees; the third, a bold and barren rock, whereon some feudal ancestor had perched his solitary fastness, dismantled now and roofless. On every side but one the hills sank steeply down to the lake's brink, leaving no space for the adventurous foot of man, feathered with coppice springing from every rift or crevice of their rocky sides; but on that one a turfy glade sloped gently to the marge, where it was bordered by a stripe of silver sand, which formed a bright and sunny frame to the dark mirror it enclosed. Just where the turf and sand united, a single and gigantic oak, known as the “friar's tree” for miles around, reared its short massive trunk, garnished with limbs as tortuous and forked as the antlers of the wild herds that loved to rub their budding horns against it in the early springtide; but supporting, even in the flush of summer, only a sparse and scanty garland of green leaves, which rustled now, all sere and yellow, in the melancholy breath of autumn. Immediately beneath the shadow of this forest patriarch, and partly overlapped by the encroachment of its twisted roots, lay a huge block of deep-red freestone, bearing the marks of rude and half-obliterated sculptures, in which some village antiquarian had traced or fancied a resemblance to a cowled and sandalled figure, whence the prevailing appellation of the tree; which, ancient as that relic evidently seemed, had probably been in its prime already when there it had been placed—placed only to survive the memory of the event or actor it had fondly been intended to immortalize. It might have been the cover of a tomb —it might have been a monument designed to celebrate some great or wonderful achievement—but, whatever was its pristine use or destination, it afforded now a pleasant seat, cushioned with soft luxurious mosses, and sheltered equally from summer heat and wintry gales by the huge stem and gnarled boughs that overhung it. A lovely and romantic spot this was—so still, so lonely, so sequestered from the eye by intervening thickets, that, although situate at scarce a bowshot from the most frequented walks, it yet was rarely visited but by some passing forester, or some true lover of the undecorated face of nature. For this cause, perhaps, it had ever been a favourite haunt of Sibyl, who, when a fairy maiden of fifteen, was wont to resort thither with book, lute, or pencil, as the fancy of the moment prompted, and for no other reason had it been the usual termination of her young wooer's wanderings. What was the aim of Edgar in choosing this fair solitude to be the scene of that most sacred audience which he had come forth to demand, he could not have, perhaps, himself explained. It might be he had formed some half-confessed and indistinct idea, that here, in the familiar trysting-place—the home of so sweet recollections, the shrine of so innumerable hopes— she would “lean to the soft side of the heart”—would be more liable to yield herself to fond and passionate impressions, than to weigh matters with an equable, calm scrutiny. It might be that habit merely, and the trick of old association, had conducted his feet thither, while the mind was far removed from thought of time or place; or it might be that, wise and philosophic as his spirit was, there yet lay dubiously concealed within it one of those strange superstitious touches—those creeds of the heart, not of the judgment—from which the bosoms of so few, even the coolest and most stern inquirers, can altogether wean themselves—one of those fancies which we all at times have felt, that some peculiar spot, or hour, or person, is secretly connected with the clew and crisis of our destiny—is, as it were, the hinge whereon the portals of our fortune turn, opening to our steps the unknown paths of future good or evil. Whatever were his thoughts, however, during their silent progress to the friar's tree, scarcely had he placed her on the monumental stone, and stretched himself before her on the dry white sand, ere he poured forth, in a voice of so sweet harmony as might have well beguiled the ear and won the heart of the most determined votary of celibacy, a tide of language fraught with such eloquence, and yet so practical in meaning—so deep in sentiment, and yet so pointed in expression—that few lips, perhaps, but his, could have delivered it, without incurring some reproach K 2 of studied insincerity, or awakening some feeling of distrust. He told her of his hopes, his doubts, his terrors—he told her how a cloud, he knew not wherefore, had overshadowed his horizon, chilling, as it were, the very sources of his most permanent and warm affections; he told her how he valued her the most of all things earthly—the most of all things, save his God, his country, and his honour! How to him her wedded love would be indeed the all in all—capable of making that which else were misery the highest and most pure enjoyment;— how, to win it, he would lay down willingly rank, name, fame, fortune, every thing save virtue! He told her that, without that crowning gift, he should, though wealthier than the wealthiest, bear but a beggared heart—though girt with myriad friends, be desolate and lonely—though dwelling in his very birthplace, be a divorced and home-sick exile! He told her of the violent and ceaseless strife between his passion and his conscience—of his profound devotion to herself, battling and scarcely to be overcome by his more deep devotion to his country's weal. “It may be,” he continued —“it may be that I am but a timorous dreamer— but a trembling visionary, shaking at causeless and unreal terrors. It may be that the trials, which I shudder merely at foreseeing, shall never come to the proof; but this is what I dread—and what, though dreading, I may not, if it come to pass, avoid or shrink from, even to win what were to me a thousand times more dear than life—the miseries of intestine war let loose to devastate our smiling country!—a wild and bloody strife, dividing brother against brother, sire against son, husband —sweet Sibyl—husband against wife!—A strife between a king determined to be absolute, a people to be free! If these things come to pass—though my life be barren, and my deathbed deserted— yea, though my heart be broken in the conflict— yet must I be for ever the sworn soldier of my country's freedom. It may however be—Heaven grant it so!—that I do falsely calculate the signs of coming wrath; it may moreover be, that, as I am, so are you a friend to liberty and justice, more than a worshipper of kings! and, if so, all shall yet be well. My father, Sibyl, my old, kind father, hath proffered freely his consent—hath urged me to obtain your promise, that you will be my own before this coming winter shall have made way for spring flowers—hath implored me `that he may see us happy—such is his only wish this side eternity —before he go to his long home!' Be mine, then, Sibyl—oh be mine, ere the fierce storm of war shall burst, which may divide us, and for ever— be mine to cheer, to guide, to comfort, and to bless —be mine for weal and wo—for time and for eternity!” While he had spoken, though her lips quivered often, and parted more than once, as if she would have interrupted him—though her colour went and came in brief and fitful flashes—the lovely girl had never once withdrawn her eyes from his pale face— pale with the struggle of contending passions—nor yet relaxed her pressure of his cold damp hand; and, as he paused from his deep-souled and eager pleading, she replied at once, though her voice faltered, and the big tears slid down her cheeks. “It is, then,” she said, “it is, then, as I dreaded! and our young hopes have been but as a morning vision! Oh, Edgar, Edgar—I have thought, I have hoped, I have prayed that these things might not be, and yet too—oh, too surely—have I known they must!” and she hurried onward with her speech, as if she feared that she should lack the strength to act up to her resolution. “Men will say,” she went on, with increasing passion—“men will say, and say truly—but I care not—that it is unmaidenly in me to speak in words how madly, how devotedly I love you. My hope of hopes has been—you cannot doubt it, Edgar, no! no! you cannot—to know myself your wife; and now my hopes are anguish and despair. But think not that I blame you—that I love you, honour you, adore you, one thousandth part the less—when I say—God grant me strength to bear it—when I say, that we can never—never now—be one. Your father has to me been as—nay, more—more than a father. To his heart your defection—such will he term and feel it—your defection from the loyalty of your high race will strike a wound, that but one other blow could aggravate or deepen. Were I to fall off likewise, he would die, Edgar; die, and leave to us his sole bequest—a father's malison. No, no! I must stay with him—must console the old man in his barren and unfriended sorrows; must sooth his cares, and turn aside his anger, lest it wax hotter and more deadly than you, you, Edgar, shall be able to endure. Nor is this all. I am a poor, weak girl—a frail, confiding creature, of a sex whose duty and whose nature is obedience—obedience to our king, our husband, our God! I argue not!—I hope not, fancy not, that I can change your judgment, founded, as it must be, on firm conviction; nor would I change it if I could! That which in women is nature, virtue, may well in men be cowardice and crime! Your intellect is strong, and wise, and wonderful —mine womanish and weak! Nor should I love and venerate you as I do, could you surrender up your wisdom at the bidding of my weakness. Then, as I respect your scruples, respect mine also. The sapling bends, indeed, to the wild blast that bows it; but, when the hurricane is overpast, it stands no less erect than the proud oak that yielded not an inch to the storm's fury. I in my weakness—you in your strength—we are alike immoveable. Yours I can not be now—may not be ever! But of this be certain—wedded or single, royalist or republican, living or in death, you only shall I love, you only honour—honour and love more deeply, that I know you greater in adherence to that which I must deem fancied and erroneous duty, than did you think as I. There is one hope for us! Edgar, my Edgar, one! If this wild storm pass by—if the green homes of England be unstained with native blood—and how more fervently than ever shall I now pray they be so—then may we yet be happy.” The blood rushed coldly to his heart as he heard her out, nor, though he had expected every word she uttered, was the shock less stunning or the anguish lighter than if the stroke had fallen on him unaware. Too well, however, did he know, and too entirely respect, the principles which doomed him to eternal and unutterable sorrow, to speak one syllable in answer or entreaty. “One kiss,” he murmured, through his set teeth—“one last kiss, my own lost Sibyl.” And she fell upon his bosom unresisting, and her white arms were twined about his neck with a convulsive clasp, and their cold lips mingled in a long embrace that had no taste of passion or of pleasure, and their tears flowed together in that gush of unchecked misery. Before an hour elapsed Ardenne had left the mansion of his fathers. The old knight wondered, and was grieved, but silent; he saw, at an eye's glance, that his own hopes—his first-born's happiness—had been dashed rudely down; but, to imagine wherefore, conjecture was itself at fault. He wept upon his neck, blessed him, and sent him forth! A pale form, indistinctly seen through the fast gathering twilight, stood in the oriel window as Edgar slowly mounted—but the burst of agonizing sobs that followed his departure was distinctly audible. Enough! Timanthes veiled the face, on which the extremity of sorrow was engraved in characters so fearful as to defy the utmost skill of human portraiture. CHAPTER VII. “This is true liberty, when freeborn men, Having to advise the public, may speak free, Which he who can, and will, deserves high praise; Who neither can, nor will, may hold his peace; What can be juster in a state than this?” Milton, from Euripides. It was a dark and gloomy afternoon in the latter days of November, when Ardenne, having already gone through all the necessary steps preliminary to his entering on his novel duties, and having devoted a few days to renewing ancient intimacies, or forming new relations, with some of the most leading men of either party, took his way for the first time toward the honoured precincts of St. Stephens, around the walls of which—now, alas! levelled to the ground for ever—the collective eloquence of ages had shed even then a halo of more than mortal glory. The house had been some time in session when he entered, and, to his almost irrepressible surprise, in passing to his seat, the object that first met his eye was the ungainly figure of the stranger who had succoured him near Royston, habited, as heretofore described, in garments coarse, unseemly, and ill-made, standing beside the table, which at times he violently struck with his clinched hand, and speaking in a sharp, croaking voice, against delay in the discussion of some motion then before the house. It did not seem to Edgar, as he looked hastily around him, that the members listened with much attention to the fiery but somewhat involved declamations of this worthy; but, after a few moments' survey, his notice was attracted by the bent brows and compressed lips of a considerable number—gravely-attired and stern-looking men, who sat apart even from those who were completely recognised as favourers of sweeping measures of reform, and ever and anon responded to the sentiments expressed by the speaker with a deep hum or sullen cheer of approbation. He could see, too, that Hampden, with whom he had advanced already beyond the earliest steps of friendly intercourse, was not inattentive to the words of this strange-looking personage; although at times a smile would flit across his comely features at some wild, undigested thought, or strong denunciation fiercely disproportionate to that against which it was levelled. He had not, however, much space for observation, since the orator, who, it seemed, had wellnigh finished his harangue ere he came into the assembly, now resumed his seat; and was at once succeeded by a youthful gentleman, whom Edgar recognised for Lucius Carey, Viscount Falkland, of an exterior so prepossessing, that in another man it would have been the principal attraction, though in this instance it was but the goodly shrine of a surpassing soul. His form was slight, but elegantly framed—his countenance, of singular and softened beauty, had for its most obvious traits a low, fair forehead, from which the waves of his light brown or almost flaxen hair hung down in natural curls below his cheeks—a full blue eye, well opened and expressive—a bright complexion—and a lip, rich, ripe, and wooing as a woman's. He was clad handsomely, in doublet, short trunk hose, and cloak of dark blue velvet slashed and lined with rich white taffeta, and was in all respects a person whose appearance would denote a man of birth and bearing. His voice, as he began to speak, was sweet and tunable, and, although weak at first, increased in energy and power as he proceeded, till Ardenne felt that he had never listened heretofore to any one combining in so eminent a degree persuasiveness and strength of language. From the Lord Falkland's words he quickly gathered that the measure under consideration was no other than the famous and much contested bill of general remonstrance, which, it appeared, had been at this late hour brought forward by the opposition party, when the morning had been wasted in minor and unprofitable questions, with the hope of smuggling it, as it were, through the house, during the absence of many, its most known opponents. The speech of the young nobleman was luminous, though brief; and touching in no respect on the principles or object of the bill, went clearly and directly to the point, asserting that it should not, at that irregular and most indecent hour, be forced upon the assembly, unprepared, at least, if not reluctant to consider it. Loudly applauded by the moderate party, as well as by the open antagonists of the measure, throughout the whole of his speech; and not less warmly, though more sparingly, at times by its impartial and sincere espousers—Hampden, and Pym, and Hollis—he concluded with a motion that the house should presently adjourn, and that this question “should be entered upon the next morning at nine of the clock, and every clause debated, the speaker in the chair.” As he sat down, a dozen members rose at once on opposite sides, and for some minutes all was clamour and confusion, trampling of feet, loud cries of “Question!” “Order!” and “Go on!” mixed with vociferated names of favourite orators, called on to utter their opinions. At length, however, Lenthal, the speaker of the house, with his clear, sonorous voice, enforced obedience to the chair, and quiet was again restored. Lord Falkland's motion instantly was seconded by Hampden, in a few words, forcibly but simply urging the necessity that this great question should be freely discussed and openly, by all who might decide to take a part therein. The house was cleared for question, and the adjournment carried with few dissenting voices. There was but little tarrying within the body of the house; but, as they passed into the lobby and down the parliament stairs, men fell into little knots of two or three, discoursing, some on the occurrences of the discussion just concluded, and some on matters of more general and varied interest. It was at this moment, just as Edgar fell into a group in which he had observed the figures of Hyde—in after days more celebrated as Lord Clarendon and Chancellor of England—St. John, Lord Digby, Colepepper, and Hampden, all spirits in some sort congenial to each other; all being favourers, ostensibly at least, though differing in mode and measure, of reform, both in the church and state—that the orator, whom he had judged at the first sight to be Lord Falkland, passed by so closely as almost to brush his person with his Vol. I.—L cloak, deeply engaged in conversation with his mysterious fellow-traveller. This latter cast a glance of recognition toward him, accompanied by a short, unceremonious nod, though without making any pause, or breaking off in his discourse, which he continued in such tones as reached the ears of Ardenne. “But verily,” he said, “but verily, I see not wherefore you would have it thus put off—for this day would right quickly have decided it.” “There would not have been time enough,” replied the other, shortly; “for it would sure take some debate.” “A very sorry one! a very sorry one, my lord, if any,” answered the puritan, who was already passing out of sight, when Edgar touched the shoulder of John Hampden, whom he had previously addressed. “I pray you, of your courtesy,” he whispered, “Master Hampden; I pray you, tell me, who is yon slovenly and clownish-looking man in converse with my lord of Falkland? for I do see he is on your side, by his warm speech to-day.” “That sloven,”[1] [1] This very remarkable and prophetic speech was actually uttered by Hampden, in reply to the question, as given above, of Lord Digby, in the first year of the Long Parliament; i.e., at a date a little earlier than that assigned to it in the text. answered Hampden—and, in after days, when the undaunted breast of him who spoke was mouldering in its bloody cerements, not the least noble victim of that lamentable strife, his auditor remembered those prophetic words— “whom you see before you, hath no ornament in his speech. That sloven, I say, if we should ever come to a breach with the king, which God forbid! in such a case, I say, that sloven will be the greatest man in England.” “Indeed!” said Ardenne, thoughtfully, “indeed! I had not thought of him so highly. And yet, I do believe, nay, I am well assured, I have encountered him before. His name—” “His name is Cromwell,” replied the patriot; “Oliver Cromwell—member now for the good town of Cambridge, and little known as yet, or listened to, save by a few austere religionists; yet of great parts! unwearied diligence—undaunted courage—penetration, that intuitively reads the wariest hearts, and perseverance, that will yield to nothing human! That you have met him I can well believe—at leastwise he doth know, and reckons of you highly! You will be here to-morrow, Master Ardenne,” he continued, after a momentary pause; “you will be here to-morrow—and with us, I trust! If we should lose this bill, it will, I fear me much, go hard with England's liberties.” “Here I shall be, past question,” answered Edgar. “I scarce should hold myself an honest man were I to quit my station in the crisis of the storm; although,” he continued, with a smile, “although that station be a new one, and its occupant but strange and inexperienced. Here shall I be, but more you must not ask of me. How I shall vote, or if indeed at all, till I have heard both reasons and objections, I may not easily decide. Wherefore, good Master Hampden, if you do care, in truth, for the assistance of my vote, you were best call to aid that eloquence and depth of reasoning whereof I hear men bear such testimony; and so convince me that my country's weal requires it at my hand! Give you good-night, fair gentlemen,” he added, with a courteous motion toward the company; “we meet again to-morrow.” “If you be not in more than common haste,” said Hampden, laying a slight detention on his arm as he turned round to leave the lobby, “I will entreat you tarry, while I speak ten words with my Lord Digby. Your lodging lies, if I mistake not, this side Charing; and my road is the same. If you can wait on me five minutes at the farthest, I will rejoice to have your homeward company; and will upon the way, I do assure you, exert what reasons I possess to win you to conviction.” Ardenne assented. Nor did the minutes which elapsed while that high-minded patriot remonstrated—as it would seem by his quick, energetic whispers—with the tergiversating noble, pass heavily, as he conversed with the distinguished men who seemed to give—desirous each, perhaps, of winning to his respective faction a partisan so like to prove of weight in the then equally poised state of parties—that eager and respectful heed to every word he uttered, which cannot fail to please the minds even of those the least accessible to ordinary adulation. With a glance pregnant of meaning, and an admonition strongly urged, although its import could not be distinguished by the by-standers, Hampden turned from Lord Digby and announced his readiness to walk, flinging his cloak in several folds over his left arm, and bringing round his rapier's hilt to meet his grasp if needed —precautions not uncalled for in those times of fierce and virulent commotion. As they passed down the stairs, the men in waiting recognised their masters, and fell at once into their places; two moving on in front with lighted links or flambeaux, necessary in those days, when the most frequented thoroughfares of the metropolis could boast few lamps but those which graced the residence of some great noble—and two stepping along three paces in the rear, their eyes warily moving to and fro, and watching with keen scrutiny the air of every passenger who met or overtook them; and their hands in frequent contact with the pommels of their swords. For, notwithstanding the eulogium passed some years before by a French resident of high distinction on the orderly and peaceful regulation of the English capital, in honourable contrast to the debauched and dangerous turbulence of Paris, party spirit at this time ran to such a height, and tumults were so constant between the factions recently accommodated with distinctive titles of cavaliers and roundheads— tumults in which much blood was spilt and even some lives lost, the sturdy citizens resisting with their bats and cudgels the rapiers of the disbanded officers and other desperadoes ever to be found about the palace of Whitehall—that few, whose purses could maintain such followers, esteemed it safe to walk the streets by night without their armed attendance; particularly such as were obnoxious to assault, or insult at the least, in consequence of party eminence or of political renown. At a few steps distance from the house they encountered a stout body of the train-bands, well equipped with muskets, swords, and bandoleers, forming a portion of the guards which, on the news of the attempt against Argyle and Hamilton, the commons had required to be detailed for their protection by the Earl of Essex, at that time general-in-chief on this side Trent; and to this it might perhaps in some degree be owing, that during their walk homeward no circumstance of annoyance or attack occurred to interrupt the converse of these high-minded men; who, though but newly and imperfectly acquainted, already felt, each for the other, that reverential admiration which is often the precursor to familiar friendship. At Ardenne's L 2 lodging door, with feelings of increased respect, and with renewed promises of a meeting on the morrow, they then parted—the one hastening to some nightly conclave, there to deliberate with his associate patriots on measures rife with England's weal—the other to stretch his limbs upon a sleepless couch, and ponder the effects of his accession to the popular party on his own fate and fortunes. Kind sleep, however, came at last, to seal up for a little space the sources of his deep disquietude, and to allay, until another sun should wake him to fresh struggles, fresh anxieties, the feverish tumults of his bosom. Still, so engrossing was the subject which last had occupied his mind before he sunk into slumber, and so powerful the operation of his spirit even while the body was buried in what seemed absolute oblivion, that scarcely had the earliest indications of the wintry twilight crept through the fogs of the near river ere he awoke, and, starting instantly from his bed, began to do his garments on, summoning the while his sluggard followers to prepare his morning meal. But, notwithstanding all his haste, so gloomy was the dawning, and so late, at that drear season, the uprising of the sun, that he had scarce the time to snatch a hasty morsel before his horses were announced to bear him to St. Stephen's, and, almost at the self-same instant, two gentlemen to speak with Master Ardenne!—and, with the word, John Hampden entered the apartment, accompanied by a person of most “unusual” and forbidding aspect. Austere, fanatical, and gloomy he might have been pronounced at the first sight by any person moderately skilful at deciphering men's characters from the expression of their features. His dress would not, perhaps, entirely bear out the charge—for such, and a most grave one, was it deemed by the wild cavaliers—of puritanism; for, although uniform and rather grave in colour, it yet was cut with attention to the prevailing mode, as well as to the setting off a person infinitely less ungainly than his countenance was harsh and extraordinary. His hat, too, which he carried in his hand, was decorated with a feather, and his sword hung from a shoulder-knot adorned with fringe and tassels. Before, however, Edgar had well surveyed the stranger, he was addressed by his companion of the previous evening. “We have, I fear, intruded somewhat on your privacy,” he said, “at this unwonted hour, I and my good friend, Harry Vane the younger; whom I beseech you, Master Ardenne, know as such; right soon, I trust, to stand in similar relation to yourself; but we were both desirous of your company this morning to the house, and I would fain propose that you shall for the present occupy a seat nigh mine. Till you shall be in some degree accustomed to the usages and method of the house, it may be my experience shall in somewhat profit you; and I fear not to make this offer, seeing that, should you find hereafter that your conscience may not justify your being one of us, I shall provide that none may look on you as a defaulter from our party—and I have heard and seen enough, methinks, already of your character and bearing to know that, even should you differ from us as to the quality or manner, you are not like to be against us as to the needfulness of some reform; so that to be seen companying one so hateful to the courtly faction as John Hampden, shall in no sort prevent you of advancement.” “Most thankfully,” said Edgar, after exchanging courtesies with Vane, “do I accept your offer; the rather, that as yet I know not, though I fain would learn, the persons of many among your famous orators—and for the rest, my vote will not, nor my opinion either, be affected anywise by sitting in this place or that. But now, if I mistake not, time is urgent, and we should be on our way. Ride you, fair gentlemen? My horses wait even now; but if you walked thus far I shall dismiss them—” “We came on horseback, and it is indeed full time we were at the house; the bells rang nine some time ere we arrived,” replied Sir Harry. “We will, if it so please you, get us at once to horse.” The pace at which they rode, when they had mounted, prevented the possibility of any serious or connected conversation, and but few minutes were consumed in the brief gallop that brought them to the low-browed portal of St. Stephen's. The privates of the civic guard on duty at the door presented arms, as if to some high officer, as the patriot leaders passed them; and it was not long ere they were seated all together in the body of the house, at no great distance from the speaker's chair. The galleries were crowded, as it seemed, wellnigh to suffocation, not with the ordinary idlers who resorted thither only to dissipate the tedium of an hour not otherwise employed, but with men whose anxious faces, and limbs that almost trembled with excitement, announced the deep and painful interest they took in the debate, which had commenced already; and with a spirit so unusual at the opening of a measure as might be held a sure prognostic of the fiery and determined ardour with which it would be carried on ere it might come to question. At the moment when they entered, Hollis was on his legs, urging with logical and beautiful precision the absolute necessity of fixing, and on grounds so sure that they should never more be moved the limits between right constitutional prerogative and absolute despotic power—pointing out the gradual and successive innovations by which the ruling monarch had encroached on all the liberties, both civil and religious, of the English people—the tampering with jesuited papists—the evident dislike to parliaments—the most illegal levyings of money by violent and arbitrary contribution—the billeting of irresponsible and lawless soldiery on private householders—the imprisoning of members contrary to privilege of parliament, for words or sentiments expressed therein—“One of whom,” he proceeded—“one noble, and eloquent, and wise, and loyal—than whom no better subject breathed the breath of life within the girt of the four seas that compass Britain—DIED—miserably died—for want of natural refreshment! Whose blood,” he added, in loud and pealing tones, that woke an echo in the breast of every free-souled man—“whose blood of life, untimely and unrighteously dried up, still cries—cries even from the dungeon-walls wherein yet lies the mouldering clay whence persecution drove the free and fearless spirit—still cries, I say, to every English heart—cries, trumpet-tongued, for vengeance!” Wildly and fiercely rose the mingled shout—for it was nothing less—of approbation and disgust. “Eliot!” exclaimed one bolder than the rest, making aloud the application which all had tacitly perceived; “Eliot! the murdered Eliot!” while the hall rang with diverse cries of “Treason!” “Vengeance!” “Order!” the latter word prevailing gradually, even as the rest subsided, till the orator again obtained a clear field for his manly elocution. With a lower voice and less impassioned manner, he proceeded to recount a train of grievances that seemed to defy enumeration—the new and unfair tax of ship-money—the seas ill guarded, and the mariners left naked to the violence of Turkish pirates—the depopulating of the city, so to raise enormous fines—the seizing of the merchants' money in the mint—the shameless project of brass coinage—the barbarous and reckless censures of self-constituted courts—“with their imprisoning and banishing—their stigmatizing, gagging, scourging, and mutilating—ay! I said mutilaling!” he went on, with energy befitting well his subject—“mutilating the free limbs of uncondemned and unoffending Britons! And I say this,” he cried, louder and clearer yet, “I say this, not of an Ottoman Divan—not of a Spanish Inquisition—but of an English Chamber!—of a Star Chamber HERE! Here, in the land of Magna Charta!—Here, where the code of Alfred is not as yet forgotten or extinct! A chamber judging not by law, and trying not by jury! A chamber forcing men to yield their substance to be wasted in the raising armies and equipping fleets—for what?—what, but to compel their fellows, their Protestant and pious brethren, to worship Him who made them, according, not to conscience nor to faith, but to the will of painted potsherds!— scarlet iniquities!—hoary and venerable sins!— wolves in sheep's clothing!—faithless and hireling shepherds, hounding the dogs upon the flock which they should guard and cherish!—prebends, and deans, and bishops!” And, amid a tumult of applause, the popular and weighty orator resumed his seat, while Hyde uprose—not, as it seemed, to answer, but to palliate, to palter, to procrastinate; for not once did he summon courage to question or deny that which no earthly wit or wisdom could disprove. And fiercely as the measure was discussed, it was yet most remarkable that not one of the royal partisans, maintaining, as they did most resolutely, the debate from morning till past midnight, spoke so much as a word to the denial of these charges—urging alone the wantonness of representing with such sharp reflections things, some of which already were amended, and others in fair state of promise toward adjustment—the impolicy of alienating more the good-will of the king, now well disposed to gracious reformation— or, above all, the wickedness of thus infusing jealousies, and strife, and discord into the bosom of a state at this time flourishing, as some had the audacity to add, beyond all previous precedent in the fair growth of freedom. All this made forcible impression on the clear mind of Ardenne, as he listened with enthusiastic feelings, it is true, but still with calm discrimination, to the successive bursts— sometimes of eloquence, thrilling, sublime, and almost superhuman in its majesty—sometimes of coarse, fanatical, and phrensied ravings—while Glyn and Maynard, Cromwell and Pym, and lastly, the unrivalled Hampden, advocated this great measure —equals all, if not in perspicuity of argument or vividness of torrent elocution, if not in talent or ability, at least in truth and fervour, and in that single-minded earnestness which proved past doubt their genuine and deep sincerity. At first he waited with strong interest the rising of some champion who should turn, or at the least dispute, the triumph with the speakers of the liberal party; then, as one after one they took their places at the table, and spoke their speeches, varied in vigour and in brilliance, but monotonous in argument, or rather in the want of it, a sense of disappointment overcame him; and by slow degrees the strong conviction gained, that the cause must be indeed vicious and feeble for which its most devoted favourers, wise, eloquent, and witty as confessedly they were, had nothing to advance beyond what he had that day heard with mingled feelings of contempt and wonder. Hours flew past like moments; and, before Edgar knew that it was noon, evening fell dark on the discussion; then, neither party willing to adjourn, candles were called for, and the strife of words went on, waxing more wild and fierce as each successive speaker added his mite of fuel to the fast-kindling blaze. Meantime the house grew thinner, as the weary and the weak, the delicate in health or frail in years, reluctantly departed, actually worn out by the lassitude that succeeds ever to unnatural excitement; and the arena of the mental gladiators became more open to their virulent contention. And still, at each succeeding pause, the liberal party seemed to gain in strength—the mighty hum of approbation rose more audibly at every bold and popular sentiment; while the cheers of the diminished royalists now failed to rouse their flagging and disheartened orators. So wondrous was the prevalent excitement, that it drove even the calm, dispassioned blood of Ardenne dancing through all his veins like streams of liquid fire; and he found himself ere long lending his breath to swell the shout of admiration that followed every sentence uttered by the latter speakers. At length the house divided on the passing of the bill; and however certain the result had seemed while distant, so thickly mustered the opponents of the measure, that many an honest heart fluttered in doubt, and many a face of England's noblest sons was dark as midnight with despondency. During the moment of confusion which always must occur at such a crisis, a whisper fell upon the ear of Edgar—a low, stern whisper, not addressed to him, nor at that instant comprehended—uttered, as he fancied, in the sneering tones of St. John. “Look now!” it said—“look now, friend Oliver, to your most promising recruit!” The answer came, though he saw not the speaker, in the harsh voice of Cromwell—“Nay, verily! but do thou look— and thine eyes shall see the truth of that I told thee!” All, at the time, passed with the speed and nearly with the tumult of a whirlwind; nor, although afterward he sometimes deemed the words had reference to himself, did they then penetrate beyond his outward ear. Without a momentary doubt, a thought of hesitation, Edgar stepped forth, and sealed the downfall of his private fortunes by the vote which he recorded in the cause of England's liberty. A small majority of but eleven voices passed that eventful bill, the loss of which would have exiled hundreds—the best and wisest of the land—driving them forth to seek, amid the snowclad wilds of the New-England shore, what they had then despaired at home—“freedom to worship God.” Scarce had the hearty cheering which followed this announcement ended, ere Hampden rose again, to move “that there might be an order entered for the present printing of it”—and straightway, as if all that had preceded it were but the prelude and slight skirmish which so generally leads to a pitched battle, a debate—if that which was all animosity, and virulence, and fury can be called debate—ensued, which speedily effaced all recollection of the previous struggle, and had wellnigh steeped the hands of the contending factions in each other's gore. Hyde started to his feet the first, praying that he might have permission to enter his protest —believing, as he said, such printing of the bill, without concurrence of the lords, to be alike unprecedented and illegal; and, ere he had well ended, Vol. I.—M up sprang Jeffry Palmer, a member of high standing in the house for wisdom and experience, no less than for distinguished talent, with flashing features and a voice that quivered with hot passion, moving “that he likewise might protest!” The mildest and most stately of demeanour among the assembled counsellors might be seen with bloodshot eyes, and tones husky and cracked with clamouring—and the more sullen and fanatical sitting with teeth hard set, and hands upon their hilts, as if but waiting for a voice to cry “The sword of the Lord and of Gideon,” or some other text of warlike and blood-thirsty import, before they should betake them, in their own language, to the carnal weapon. So critical, indeed, was the conjuncture of affairs, and to such lengths had private pique and public animosity been carried, among men all armed in token of their gentle birth, that, writing coolly in his journal after the heat and passion of the contest had gone by, Sir Philip Warwick has recorded, “that when they voted it I thought we had all sat in the valley of the shadow of death; for we, like Joab and Abner's young men, had catched at each other's locks, and sheathed our swords in each other's bowels, had not the sagacity and great calmness of Mr. Hampden, by a short speech, prevented us, and led us to defer our angry debate until next morning.” And so in truth it was; for at two of the clock past midnight, when he saw that nothing could be hoped in the then temper of the house, that wise and upright statesman moved an adjournment until two of the next afternoon, prescribing motives so replete with good sense and good feeling, that none so stubborn as could, with any show of right, gainsay him. Worn out and wearied, body and mind alike, with the protracted contest, men of both parties mingled hurriedly as they flocked homeward; and again it was the chance of Ardenne strangely enough to be ear-witness to a conversation between Cromwell and Lord Falkland. The former he had joined, hard by the foot of the great staircase, desiring in some degree to cultivate relations with a man whose words and aspect had imbued him with a feeling which he could not well account for or define, but which in after days he mentioned as a prophetic awe, for that he was in presence of a spirit mightier than his own. The latter overtook them suddenly, and was passing onward at the first without addressing either, till he caught the eye of Cromwell. “Ha!” he said, with a quiet smile, not wholly free from irony— “Ha! Master Cromwell, think you there hath been a debate to-day?” “Another time,” replied the puritan—“another time, and I will take thy word—but verily, I say to you—verily, as the Lord Jehovah liveth, had this remonstrance been rejected, then had I sold mine all of worldly substance on the morrow—ay! and had taken up my staff, and girt me with my sword upon my thigh, and never had seen England any more!” “Nor you alone, perchance!” answered the youthful noble, after a moment of reflection. “Methinks I have heard others named for a like resolution!” “Perchance!—Me no perchance!” cried Oliver, with a triumphant smile. “Had the malignants carried it, I tell you that their victory had robbed old England of her trustiest spirits! But now, my lord, mark well my words!—and you too, friend— if that you be, as I do partly think you are—and if you be not, and I be in error, then may the Lord enlighten and amend you—a friend to liberty, mark well my words! There shall be no stint more, nor let, nor hinderance! Papists and tyrants in this soon-to-be-regenerated land shall no more hold dominion! The name of Englishman, now scorned and scoffed at throughout Europe—you, Edgar Ardenne, you do know the truth of that which I aver—shall be as far and wide revered as ever was the name of antique Roman! For verily I tell ye —and I tell ye truth—that now the Lord's good time hath come, when he shall choose him out a MAN! I say not whom—nor were it meet that I, the vilest and most worthless of his instruments, should judge whom the Lord listeth to appoint— but verily, I say, a MAN, who shall bring mighty things to pass in Israel!” CHAPTER VIII. “Lo! how 'tis ever on the stillest day— When the breeze stirs not in the topmost bough The aspen's quivering leaf—when peaceful clouds Hang balanced in the dull and moveless air— When earth and ocean bask in deep repose, Securely tranquil—that the thundrous storm Rends the calm sky which bred it.” After that mighty trial of the strength of parties—the bill of general remonstrance—had passed through the house, there followed a short pause—a lull, as it were, in the loud tempest of commotion —a breathing-space snatched from the midst of battle. With the exception of a short and somewhat turbulent debate on the day following that of the main question, originating in a wish on the part of the puritanic leaders to punish those who had protested on the previous night, but resulting merely in a penalty of form inflicted on one person, Jeffry Palmer—the commons seemed to relax in the vigour of their defensive warfare against the crown. The bill for regulation of the militia and prevention of forcible impressment, unless in case of actual invasion, was, it is true, brought forward, but without any of that inveterate and rancorous spirit which had signalized their earlier measures. The king, on his return from Scotland, was received— chiefly in consequence of the exertions of Sir Richard Gourney, the lord mayor of London, an active and uncompromising loyalist—with loud, if not sincere, manifestations of welcome and affection—was feasted at the Guildhall with more than ordinary splendour, and hailed, as he passed to and fro the city, with thundering acclamations by the wavering and worthless populace. A farther triumph still awaited him in the address presented at his residence of Hampton Court, by aldermen deputed from the city, requesting him to take up his abode among them, and to hold his court, as heretofore, in his palace of Whitehall. This loyal and well-timed address—reputed, as it was, to be distasteful in no small degree to parliament—was graciously accepted; the deputies all knighted, and the request granted joyfully. The bills, moreover, most obnoxious to the king—that principally which would exclude the bishops' votes—made but slow progress, and, even should it pass the commons, was not expected to receive the sanction of the lords. Falkland and Colepepper, heretofore active members of the reforming party, although moderate and wary, now having taken office openly—the former being secretary of state in lieu of Vane, the latter chancellor of the exchequer—held nightly conferences at the house of Hyde for the well and M 2 wisely ordering the shaken and dismantled principles of government; and would, as it seems probable, have met with eminent success in their beneficent and patriotic measures, had it not been for secret influences and the prevalence of counsellors behind the throne, unseen and unsuspected, but exercising—and for ends most infamous and selfish— a power, to which, unhappily for him and for his kingdom, the mind of Charles, easily led, and prone to arbitrary counsels, though obstinate and inaccessible to aught of argument unsuited to his own opinions, yielded complete obedience. Such was the state of matters—things gradually looking brighter and more bright for the royal party, and the remonstrant leaders, Hampden especially, not only becoming less violent in their opposition, but beginning to judge more favourably of the king's motives and intent—when the insane and childish protest of the bishops, instigated to it by the proud and angry Williams, was sent forth, declaring “all laws, orders, votes, resolutions, and determinations already passed, or such as shall hereafter pass, during their absence from that most honourable house”—compulsory, as they affirmed it—“null and of none effect.” The consequence was an immediate and almost unanimous vote, both of the lords and commons, for the committal of the prelates to the tower—one solitary member only so far opposing it, as to declare that he believed them utterly insane, and therefore recommended Bedlam, rather than the tower, as a fit place for their detention. Then came reports of plots—rumours of aggressions meditated on the lower house—doubts, and despondencies, and wrath, and panics! It was believed on all sides, that, without confident assurance of support, the bishops had not dared to rush to such extremities. Petitions were poured in from every quarter! One from the city, setting forth that, since their loyal gratulations on his majesty's return had been misconstrued as though they would disown the doings of the parliament, they now declared their full resolve to live and die with them for the good of the commonwealth. Addresses multiplied, and were accompanied, even to the palace, by such crowds, that, in a message to the common council, the king complained of the tumultuous assemblages daily increasing, to the disturbance of his palace of Whitehall. On the same day the parliament petitioned him to grant to them a guard, commanded by the Earl of Essex—that detailed for their protection during his absence in the north having been instantly disbanded on his late return —on account of a malignant party now daring openly to threaten them with violence. To this request, reasonable as after events proved it to have been, the self-willed monarch returned a negative, though offering that such a guard should wait on them—under a leader of his own choice, utterly subservient to his will—“as he would be answerable for to Almighty God!” This proposition they of course declined, perceiving, doubtless, that the guard so ordered would be more like to militate against their liberties, if not their persons, than to defend them from external outrage. It was upon the very day that followed this insidious offer—for such it must be deemed—that, urged by his worst counsellor, the false and faithless Henrietta, to that most rash and headlong step which rendered his affairs for ever irretrievable, and reconciliation with his subjects hopeless—elated still by his reception in the city, and heedless of the daily proofs of public feeling and opinion, he went on to commit his last and desperate aggression on the privilege of parliament—an aggression! which, had they tamely borne, his throne would have been fixed for ever on the firm basis of despotic rule, and England would have lain a fettered captive at his tyrannous footstool. It was on the next day, while the protestation—that he would be answerable to Almighty God for the safe-guarding of their liberties and persons—was yet fresh on his lips, that he struck that blow at the very existence of parliaments, which, had it fallen as intended, must have destroyed them root and branch. For, on the afternoon of that eventful day, Herbert, the king's attorney-general, entered the house of peers, then sitting, and, drawing out a paper in the king's own writing, read it aloud; by which the Lord Kimbolton, present there and then—and of the commons, Denzil Hollis, and Sir Arthur Hazlerig, Pym, Strode, and Hampden, stood each and all accused of treason, as conspirators against the king and constitution. The peers sat actually panic-stricken and aghast at this tremendous stroke of folly and misgovernment, hearing in sullen silence the grave accusation, while Kimbolton, springing to his feet, with eloquent and strenuous indignation, professed his total innocence; nor was there any lord so hardy to so much as move for his committal on his majesty's behalf, Meanwhile the commons' house was entered by the king's sergeant, demanding that the speaker should deliver up the bodies of the members named above, to answer to a charge of treason—bearing no warrant or authority from magistrate or counsellor, but acting solely at the king's behest, and without intervention of the law. News came at the same instant that the private lodgings of those members had been visited by royal messengers, their trunks and studies sealed up, and their papers violently seized. With bold and masculine resolve, well suited to the peril of the crisis, did the house meet this haughty and high-handed insolence! The sergeant, having gone through his message, was desired to avoid the chamber; but word was sent the monarch by a deputation, assuring him those members should be instantly forthcoming so soon as any legal charge should be preferred against them—the house declaring, by a powerful vote, those violent acts of seizure breaches of privilege, audacious, and illegal!—empowering their members to resist; calling on all men to abet and aid them in resisting such attempts upon their liberties as freeborn Britons; and instantly adjourning for the night until the wonted hour on the morrow. It was at a late hour in the evening of this fatal day that several ladies of the court, richly and splendidly attired, might have been seen collected in a proud saloon, decked with the master-pieces of Vandyke and Rubens, with tapestries of Gobelins and Arras hangings, with cabinets of buhl and marquetry, buffets of antique golden plate and yet more costly porcelain, and all those priceless luxuries which mark a royal dwelling. Among this glittering group, and seemingly its principal, was one—a lady of low, slender stature, and a shape slightly awry, though, by skill of her tire-woman, this defect was so disguised as to be scarce perceptible. Her hands were delicate, and gemmed—as were her ears, her neck, the bosom of her robe, and the rich volumes of her jet-black hair— with Indian brilliants. Her features were agreeable and sprightly, yet such as could not properly be praised as regular or beautiful; a pair of bright black eyes and a coquettish smile forming their chief attraction. Her conversation, lively, and perhaps even brilliant, though flippant and unguarded, was listened to by her attendant ladies, and by the only cavalier admitted to the presence—a man of noble bearing, easy yet dignified, and withal in person eminently handsome—with an attention so profound that it denoted—even without the bended knee and the averted back—the speaker to be one of royal rank. Music and cards were in the chamber, and a most lovely girl, of some seventeen or eighteen years, was dancing to the amatory strains of some concealed musician, in a style which would be now esteemed far too voluptuous, if not absolutely meretricious, to be performed by the chaste limbs of ladies, or looked upon by modest eyes. Yet neither lansquenet, nor the soft melody, nor the exciting graces of the beautiful dancer, appeared sufficient to banish some uneasiness which lowered over that fair company. The brow of Henrietta, for she it was, was dark and gloomy, much against its wont, and her ill-humour had been so far contagious as to affect her bright companions with all the outward signs of discontent and sorrow. While she was talking earnestly to the Lord Digby, now —since the flight of Jermyn, her adulterous paramour—her most beloved and trusty counsellor, a short and hasty step was heard without, accompanied by a slight bustle, as if some more distinguished personage had suddenly and by surprise come on the unexpectant chamberlains and pages, sole inmates of the antechamber. The door of polished oak flew open, and, bearing evident marks of discomposure in his lip depressed and overshadowed brow, a gentleman of graceful presence entered the apartment. Of that time of life when the rashness and the fire of youth are tempered by the sedateness of increasing years, although the face has lost no trait of its attraction, nor the limbs of their alert and agile motion, Charles Stuart—for the new-comer was no other—was of a middle height, but strong and well proportioned, excepting that his legs were triflingly bowed outward, a circumstance which, while detracting somewhat from the grace and symmetry of his appearance, was favourable more than otherwise to his accustomed exercise of horsemanship—to which, indeed, it might have been in some sort owing. His visage, of a just and oval form, was pleasing, although dark-complexioned; his features regular and comely, with a full dark eye; gentle, and somewhat dull in its expression, unless its owner were aroused to sudden anger, when it could kindle up and flash as brightly as the keenest; he wore mustaches, somewhat unusually large and curling upward, with a small pointed beard of that precise and formal cut which is so often met with in the portraits of Vandyke. The most remarkable trait, however, of his whole appearance, was that continual cloud of mild and softened melancholy from which his dignified and stately aspect rarely or never brightened; for, even when he smiled, it was a faint and transient flash, scarce clearing up the gloom of that accustomed sadness which brooded over his countenance—although his disposition was cheerful more than otherwise, and, if not buoyant, certainly neither mournful nor despondent—and which, as fanciful and superstitious men have oftentimes imagined, is ominous of an untimely end. His dress, of plain black velvet, slashed and lined with satin, differed in nothing—save that upon the left side of his cloak glittered the diamond star belonging to the order of the garter—from the garb of any private gentleman. He wore his hat above his sable hair, long-curled and flowing, and in his hand he carried a strong cane or ferule, with a crutch head of gold, which he struck passionately upon the carpet as he entered. “The undutiful, disloyal varlets!” he exclaimed, in tones of strong excitement. “The false, rebellious knaves!—to deal thus with their sovereign!” —and for several moments he paced to and fro the room, regardless of the eager entreaties of his affrighted wife to speak the cause of his distemperature. “A message!” he burst forth at length, but in a voice broken and faltering with passion. “To me! to me a message! I tell you, Marie, an' they have their will, I may indeed be called your majesty—be served upon the knee—be waited on bareheaded—but I shall be no more a king—nay, ten times less the master even of myself, than the most lowly gentleman in all my wide dominions. But so shall it not be!—No! By God—never!” and in a few disjointed sentences he told her how he had demanded of the parliament the bodies of six members, on a charge of treason against himself and them—and had received, not prompt obedience to his orders, but a message! “And is it possible,” she cried, artful and evil woman that she was, in feigned astonishment and indignation—“and is it possible, my lord, that you —you, heir to such a line of mighty sovereigns— you, monarch of Great Britain—will be thus braved and thwarted—will be controlled, defied, and trampled on by such a scum of low and scurvy fellows as this parliament? That you will brook to have your crown robbed of its brightest jewels of prerogative—your sceptre wrested from your hands without one struggle? Would—wretched princess that I am—oh, would to God that I had tarried in my own glorious France, or that I had been wedded to a MAN!” “Madam, go to!” the king retorted sharply— for, all uxorious as he was, and prone to hold her slightest words as mandates to his will, his temper, naturally hasty and unpliant, was aggravated now, even beyond its wont, by the commingled influence of anger and irresolution. “Be silent—and dare not impugn our energy and courage. England and you shall know, and that right speedily, that neither will Charles Stuart brook insolence at home, nor usurpation of his rights abroad! And for these —rash and reckless rogues—they too shall learn that I am yet a king!” “Well said!—well said, my gracious sovereign!” exclaimed Digby, with an exulting voice and an elated eye. “Better to crush at once this spawn of venomous and vicious serpents in the dark den wherein they have engendered, than one by one to scotch them, when they shall have crawled forth to pollute the blessed daylight, and swelled from grovelling reptiles to the full growth of rampant dragons!” “In this,” cried Henrietta—“in this most noble wrath, again I recognise the worthiest, the most high-souled of men! To-morrow shalt thou pull these vile rogues by the ears from out their infamous cabal! Else never look me in the face again!” “Brave girl,” replied the facile king, ruing already his late burst of anger—“Brave, brave Marie, and beautiful as brave!” and, throwing one arm round her waist, he led her to a sofa at the farthest end of the saloon, where, seating himself at her side, he hung, with all the manifest and ardent passion of a boy-lover over the wily Delilah, who— prodigal in secret to another than himself of her voluptuous charms—had yet the perfidy, and with it too the power, to woo him, by a scanty and reluctant show of public fondness, to measures, her only interest in which was to bring back a banished lover to her guilty arms—how ruinous soever they might be, she recked not, to her too trusting husband. Vol. I.—N CHAPTER IX. “A King?—A Tyrant! It is a King's—to hold his sceptre firm By love, not terror—his assured throne, A people's confidence—his sword, the law Tempered with mercy—and to guard the right, The sole condition that affears his crown! A Tyrant's—by enforcement stern to reign, And slavish fear—no charter to admit Beyond his present pleasure—nor no rule His absolute yea beside.” During the first part of the night which followed this aggression of the monarch, the city was all tumult and confusion—men running to and fro, in crowds or singly, conversing eagerly with white and panic-stricken visages—women, increasing, with their shrill and anxious voices, the wild din— and children, long hours past the wonted time when they should have been sleeping peacefully in their warm chambers, wandering to and fro, with looks of frightened and inquiring wonderment cast upward toward the agitated features of their parents; but the necessity of rest will conquer even the quickest and most moving causes of excitement; and ere the stars began to pale in the cold, frosty sky, the thoroughfares of the metropolis were quiet and deserted as though no turbulence of party strife had ever interrupted their security and silence. The morning broke in its due season, and the only thing observable in the demeanour of the groups who gradually filled the streets, passing this way or that, as men engaged in their accustomed avocations—in their pursuits of profit or of pleasure—was an air of general and pervading sternness—not merely gloom, but resolute and dark determination. There was no light or trifling conversation! no jests! no laughter! Whatever of discourse seemed absolutely needful was couched in brief and pithy sentences, and uttered in a tone not puritanic nor morose, but sad, and at the same time full of energy, grave, and severe, and wellnigh awful in its character. Then, as the day advanced, the members of the lower house might be seen hurrying toward St. Stephen's— some mounted, some on foot, but all accompanied by at least one retainer; and these were greeted severally by the multitude with shouts of approbation, or with groans of censure and reviling, accordingly as they were known for men of popular or loyal principles. Meanwhile, in a small chamber of the palace at Whitehall, richly adorned with painted walls and splendid oaken carvings, and overlooking, from its lofty casements, the street through which the crowds were flowing toward the parliament, sat Henrietta, with a single lady, and a page awaiting, near the door of the apartment, the pleasure of his royal mistress. A frame filled with embroidery stood before her, at which it seemed she had but recently been occupied; though now she held a volume of some French romance, from which, however, her eyes glanced so often toward the windows, attracted by the mingled clamours of applause and hatred, rising at times even until they penetrated her reluctant ears, as to denote that little of her mind was given to the wild, witty author who apparently engaged her. Her eyes were full of bright and keen excitement; a hectic flush glowed in a spot of vivid crimson high up on either cheek, and her hands trembled with a visible and nervous agitation. Her conversation, also, if the light and frivolous sentences that fell from her lips at intervals merited such a title, was broken, interrupted, and evidently embarrassed by some internal conflict which she hesitated to disclose. For a considerable time she struggled to maintain a semblance of composure; but, as the hours passed onward, her trepidation became more and more apparent. At every step that sounded in the long corridors, at every closing of a distant door, she started; and once or twice, when the rattle of a carriage or the clatter of a horse's hoofs appeared to cease before the gates, she actually hurried to the balcony and gazed abroad into the town, exposing herself, as if unwittingly, to the rude stare of the transient multitudes, who failed to greet her with the smallest tokens of affection or respect. Twice or thrice, ere the bells chimed ten, the page in waiting was despatched to learn whether no tidings had arrived from parliament—and each time he returned the bearer of a negative, a peevish exclamation of disgust escaped her, not unnoticed by the lady who attended on her privacy. At length, peal after peal, the steeples rang forth ten, and then, with an exulting smile, as though she could contain herself no longer—“Rejoice!” she cried, in high, triumphant tones—“Rejoice, my Carlisle— for ere now the king is master in his states—ay! and his enemies are all in custody!” “His enemies, your grace?” exclaimed the patriotic lady, to whom, with indiscretion equalled only by that of the rash, doting husband whom she thus betrayed, she had divulged her secret—“His enemies?” “His enemies, said I?” returned the queen, in accents sharper than before. “In truth, then, I spake wrongly! His traitors, rather! His false, rebellious, and blood-thirsty traitors—by God's help, now his captives—Hampden, and Pym, and all their rabble rout!” And, as she spoke—sweeping across the room with such a port as would have well beseemed a Britomart striding upon the prostrate necks of Romans, in their turn subdued and humbled—and entering again the balcony, she cast a wistful glance down the long avenue. But scarcely had she turned her back before the high born lady whom she had addressed hastily tore a leaf from out her tablets, traced on it some half dozen words, and pleading, on the queen's return, some casual indisposition, quietly left the chamber. Ten minutes had not well elapsed ere she re-entered it—nor would the change in her demeanour have escaped the close and subtle watchfulness of her imperial mistress, had not that royal lady been herself perturbed too deeply to investigate the mood of others. The Countess of Carlisle's features, cast in the purest and the calmest mould of conscious aristocracy, had worn throughout the morning an expression of grave feminine anxiety, and her broad, placid eye had followed, with a quiet yet observing scrutiny, every unwonted movement, every nervous start, and every change of colour that had resulted from the queen's excitement; nor had she tardily discovered that some dread crisis was at hand—though what that crisis was, not having been a party to the councils of the regal circle on the previous night, she might not even guess. The thoughtless words, however, of the fickle-minded Henrietta had given her at once the clew, which her quick apprehension followed, as it were, intuitively through all its labyrinth; and she at once availed herself of the discovery she had made with a degree of cool and present courage, that, even in that age of prompt and daring action, failed not to wake the admiration which it merited. Now, however, when the hardening excitement N 2 had passed over—when the nerves, which had been strung so tensely to the performance of her duty, were no longer kept in play—when she knew that her trusty messenger was on his way, and past the palace gates already, bearing the tidings of approaching insult—outrage—and peril —to the liberties of England's parliament, the majesty of England's laws, she for the first time trembled, not for herself, but for her country! She for the first time began to fear that she might be too late, and that the blow might have already fallen, ere her warning should arouse the destined victims to perception of their danger. Her face was paler than its wont, and her blue eye, so tranquil in its usual expression, was slightly anxious. Yet it was but a little while that her uncertainty continued— for, ere an hour had elapsed, the queen, whose passions became more and more enkindled with every moment of suspense, sending another messenger to learn whether the houses were in session still, received for answer that they had just adjourned until one of the clock, and that the members even now were passing to their lodgings. “Heavens!” cried Henrietta, almost in despair at this unpleasing and most unexpected news— “Just Heavens! can it be that he hath failed me!” and casting herself down at length upon a couch, covered her head with a thick veil, and waited, in an agonized and speechless fit of mingled hope and terror, the result of her intriguing machinations. In the meantime the house, which had assembled at the usual hour, not altogether unexpectant of some farther outrage on their privileges, had indeed, on receiving the well-timed announcement from the Countess of Carlisle, upon the instant voted an adjournment; that they might better so concert plans of resistance to that lawless violence which they were now too well assured their sovereign had resolved to perpetrate. It was at this moment, when all were hastening homeward, that Ardenne observed Cromwell hurrying to and fro among the leading favourers both of the popular and puritanic principles, and whispering to one a word or two, then passing to another—and, as he gazed upon his compressed lip, and eye flashing with almost savage pleasure, he felt, even more strongly than at any prior moment, the conviction that this wily person was indeed engaged more intimately in directing the important springs of party action, than could have been supposed from the inferior part which he was wont to play in its ostensible and open movements. He knew not at the time, any more than four fifths of the house, what were the secret news which had so suddenly produced adjournment; and had, indeed, himself voted against a measure which he could not comprehend, although the private hints of Oliver and Hampden had not escaped his notice; nor could he now conceive the meaning of the strong excitement which kindled all who listened to the words of Cromwell, as it were, with an electric spark. Not long, however, was he destined to remain in ignorance; for, with his harsh features even more than commonly inflamed and ruddy, the puritan approached him. “Ha!” he said, in a loud, sharp whisper—“Ha! Master Ardenne; how is this, that you, to whom we confidently looked for succour, should, in this strait and peril, have turned against us, consorting with the men of Belial?” “I know not, Master Cromwell,” Ardenne replied—“I know not, in good truth, to what you do allude; nor have I heard of any strait or peril. I saw, indeed, that you and Master Hampden were desirous I should vote for this adjournment; but seeing no cause wherefore, nor being, so far as I knew it, your follower or pledged supporter, assuredly I deemed it best for mine own honour to abide by the poor dictates of mine own opinion.” “Call it you then no strait,” asked Oliver, with a dark sneer upon his lip—“no strait nor peril, that Charles Stuart should dare come hither with his accursed cavaliers—with his lewd yeomen and rakehelly pensioners—seeking out whom they may devour—having their swords new-whetted, and their hearts a-fire, to shed the blood of the saints— should dare come hither—hither, within these privileged, time-honoured walls—to lay his violent, tyrannical hands on those with whose salt only we are savoured?” “What mean you, sir?—speak out!” cried Ardenne. “Will he indeed do this? Can he be so infatuated—so insane?” “Will Charles Stuart dare it?” said the other; “say rather what he will not dare, if we, the watchers and the guardians sitting on the tower, yea! on the house-top, to give note of coming wo, blow not the trumpet through the land. Yea! will he come, and that right shortly—yea! will he come, and if our hearts be not the stronger—and our arms too, if need there be—will trample down the liberties of England unto everlasting!” “Never! no, never!” exclaimed Edgar, vehemently moved—“No, never shall he do so! never while I—if none beside—have sword to wield, and hand with which to wield it.” “Ay! is it so?” returned the other, his whole face blazing out with a triumphant ecstasy—“Ay! is it so? and would you draw the carnal sword if it were needed?” “Would I?” cried Ardenne—“would I unsheath the sword to guard these holy walls from desecration? Would I uplift my arm against the hireling ministers of lawless and despotic violence?—ay, were those ministers ten thousand sworded spirits!” “Then fare thee well,” cried Oliver—“then fare thee well, and hold fast to thy good resolve, while I go wake the rest to a like sense; above all, be thou in thy place when we again assemble, and then call thou me fool and liar, an' thou see not great things!” The interval passed speedily away, consumed in wise and seemly preparation. Notice was despatched to the lord mayor and corporation of the threatened danger; the citizens were all admonished to stand upon their guard; and members were sent down to the Temple and the Inns of Court to warn the students that the house was well aware how they had been already tampered with; and to command they should not come, on any plea, to Westminster; and, ere the time appointed, the house was crowded. Edgar was in his place among the first; and as he saw the five obnoxious members calmly resume their seats, as though no peril threatened them, a mingled sentiment of admiration and regret thrilled to his heart at the idea, that, if indeed the king, with his wild, dissolute attendants, should forcibly attempt to seize them, they surely would resist, and but too probably be slaughtered on the very spot which they had made to ring so often with their proud, patriotic eloquence. As he thus thought, a new impression shot with the speed of light into his mind—“If they be absent—if they be absent when he come— the fearful consequences may be perchance averted, which otherwise must, beyond doubt, result from letting loose a band of reckless soldiery to rush in, sword in hand, on gentlemen armed likewise, and almost unanimous to guard their liberties with life.” And on the instant he arose, and in a few words, powerful and manly, moved that the house should grant permission to those members to withdraw themselves, lest tumult, and perhaps even worse than tumult, fall of it. “I second it,” cried Cromwell, starting to his feet—“I second the most honourable member's motion. Let them withdraw them straightway to the city until this tyranny be overpast.” Without a single voice or vote dissentient, the question then was carried; and the house gave permission that they might retire; and, at solicitation from their friends, they instantly departed. Scarce had the hurry and confusion consequent on their withdrawal ceased, ere a dull, trampling noise was heard without, as of a powerful band of men; a word to halt was given, and for a while the sound was hushed, the members sitting stern and silent in their places, disdaining to show any sign either of wrath or terror. Again the sounds were heard ascending the great staircase; and now the clink of steel, as the broad blades of partisan or halberd clashed together—and now a shout, “Fall on! Fall on!” mixed with the shuffling tramp of feet, the jingling of scabbards, and all the bustle that accompanies a sudden and disordered march. Nearer and nearer came the tumult—the lobby was already filled, to judge from the increasing clatter, with armed intruders; and now the din of grounded arms rang audibly upon the ears of the undaunted counsellors. Then for the first time was a show of passion manifested among the younger gentlemen—a dozen, at the least, impetuously started to their feet, and not a few grasped, with an energy that proved how fearlessly they would have used them, the hilts of the long rapiers which all of gentle birth at that time carried. A single word, however, from the speaker of the house—a single cry of order, sufficed to bring them peacefully into their places. But there they sat, with eyes that actually lightened with strong indignation, and with that fiery aspect of the gladiator, which marked how rapturously they would have plunged into the fiercest conflict. At this instant was the door thrown open, and a messenger sent in, who reverentially enough informed the house that the king was at the door, and that the speaker was commanded to sit still, with the mace lying on the board before him. Still not one word was spoken—not a whisper—not a breath, nor murmur, through that spacious hall!—and every man sat fast, with head unmoved, and eyes fixed sternly straight before him; as if they did not so much as vouchsafe to cast a glance, still less a thought, toward the violator of their rights. Had there been aught of riot or confusion—had there been aught of armed and passionate resistance— nay, had there been any fear, or doubt, or wavering, it then had been an easier task for the misguided king to carry out his frantic and destructive purpose. But hard it is, and most revolting to all human feelings, to outrage and assault where there is neither terror nor resistance. It was perhaps a minute after the messenger retired, before aught new disturbed the silence that prevailed unbroken beneath the vaulted roof—a minute, fraught with the thronged sensations of unnumbered years—a minute, that seemed longer than a life to every patriot seated there, as gravely steadfast as those senators of early Rome, who waited in their robes of dignity, and on their curule chairs, the moment when the Gallic horde should pour out on their white, unshrinking heads the cups of massacre and vengeance. Then came a quick, irregular tread, that readily betokened, by its uncertain time, the irresolution and anxiety that were at work within the breast of him who was approaching. “Enter not, any of ye, on your lives!” was uttered in the harsh voice of the king, before his person came in view—an order understood by all who heard, as it was doubtless meant by him who uttered it, to be words, empty words, and spoken for effect! Then, leaning on the shoulder of the palsgrave, Charles Stuart advanced! Those who stood nearest to his person might have seen a momentary pause—a brief, involuntary hesitation—a reluctance, hardly, perhaps, acknowledged to himself, to cross what was to be the Rubicon of all his future fortunes; but so short was the pause, so small the effort it required to conquer that reluctance, that it would seem indeed as if—according to the classic proverb—destined already to destruction, he were deserted by his sanity of intellect. Perhaps he had expected fear—abject and tame submission!—had supposed that he should stride in triumph, unopposed, and sued to on the bended knee, through that magnificent assemblage! Perhaps he had expected anger, indignation, and defiance! But now, as he looked up those lines of crowded benches, and met no glance of recognition—encountered no full front either of wrath or scorn— but caught alone, row behind row, those stern and masculine profiles, composed, severe, and passionless—profiles, averted less in resentment than in proud, contemptuous sorrow—his wayward spirit for a moment's space recoiled, and he half wished the perilous step untaken. It was but for the twinkling of an eye, however, that his rash mood of obstinacy failed him; for, without a quiver of his nerves, a change of his dark features, he strode across the threshold, about a pace before his foreign kinsman. The Earl of Roxborough, a tall and powerful man, armed, somewhat more than commonly, with a long military sword and heavy poniard at his belt, had followed close upon his master's footsteps, until he also stood upon the threshold; he crossed it not, however, but stood there, leaning with his whole weight against the door, which opened outwardly, so that it would have been impossible for any from within the house to close it—his right hand resting, as if carelessly, upon the pommel of his war-sword, and his left twirling, with a gesture of unbridled insolence, his long mustaches—while many a fierce, licentious countenance might be seen glaring from behind him on the conservators of their country's freedom with a wild and wolfish aspect of malignant hatred. The king himself, attired as usual in a plain garb of sable velvet, wearing no weapon but an ordinary walking-sword, and carrying in his right hand, together with his staff, the dark-plumed beaver which he had doffed on entering, stalked coolly up the house—the palsgrave following slowly, and, as it seemed, with a half timid and reluctant step. Still all was silence!—silence so profound, that, save the heavy footsteps of the monarch, not a sound could be perceived—unless it were when from without some weapon-clang was heard, or some rude threat or grisly imprecation was muttered in the antechamber by the desperate attendants of a Lunsford or a Digby. The face of Charles, grave and even sorrowful by nature, was something paler than its wont; but with that sort of paleness which conveys no thought of cowardice or trembling, but of resolve immoveable and icy. His mouth was firmly closed, but not compressed, nor showing aught of effort! His eye, calm, searching, cold—but keen and hard as iron! His nostril only of his features Vol. I.—O gave token of emotion, or of any feeling hotter than determination; for it was dilated, wide, and slightly quivering! Yet was his hand steady as the columns which upheld the roof above him, and his stride, now that he stood among his lieges—however it had been irregular and hasty ere he entered —was measured, long, and equal. As he advanced along the floor, he turned his head from side to side, perusing, with deliberate and steady glance, the lineaments of every member whom he passed; and if when at a distance not one eye had sought him, so when he now stood close beside them not one eye avoided him. Each, as Charles came into his line of direct vision, met his hard gaze with an unblenching and unloving brow; for not one man—even of those the most devoted to his will, of those who would have served him at that moment, who afterward did serve him with their whole hearts and lives—but was disgusted, angered, full of deep sorrow, almost of despair. Little there was, however, of the stronger and more stormy passions painted upon the brows of those who sat thus fearlessly, braving the temper of a king whose wrath was no less lasting and vindictive than it was hot and sudden. The expression that prevailed most largely was of mingled aspect, half pity, half defiance. But when the tyrant—for that action, if that only, justified the title—approached the seat of Cromwell—perhaps at that day scarcely known by name to the proud sovereign—and his glance fell upon those grim, ungainly features—then Ardenne witnessed —for his eye was still attracted, why he knew not, with a strange sense of fascination toward the puritan—then Ardenne witnessed that which in after times he often called to mind, and never without awe and wonder—a dark conflict—for such it might indeed be termed—a conflict of eye, countenance, and bearing, between those men so eminently thrown together, and blended in their spheres of good or evil action. The glance of Charles, when first it fell upon the coarse and most unpleasing lineaments of Oliver, was instantly averted; but averted merely as men ever turn the eye away from objects naturally hateful or unseemly. At that point of time the face of Cromwell was as tranquil, as immoveable, as that of his great future rival; but the tranquillity was no less different, than is the stillness of a hushed volcano and the peaceful calm of heaven. The swollen and corded veins upon the temple—the eyebrows lowered and contorted—the balls gleaming beneath them with a fixed and baleful light—the nostril rigidly distended, and the lips pressed so tightly that they alone of his whole aspect were of a livid whiteness! Ere Edgar had the time to think, had there been any matter yet for thought, the eye of Charles stole back, half timidly as it appeared, toward that tiger-like and glaring face. Then, as it met the sinister and ominous stare of fierce defiance, it brightened also—vivid, and keen, and with a falcon-like and noble splendour. For some short space they gazed—those two undisciplined and haughty spirits—into each other's very souls— mutually, as it seemed, conscious at a glance of irremediable and desperate hostility. The king's look, quiet, although high and angry, and most unutterably proud!—Cromwell's, sarcastic, bitter, furious, and determined—and withal so savagely triumphant, so mirthful in its dire malignity, that Ardenne thought he never had beheld a countenance so fiendishly expressive! And Charles Stuart's aspect—after a fixed encounter of ten seconds' space—Charles Stuart's haughty aspect quailed beneath it; and, as he passed along—for the whole occurred in less time than were needful to recite it—he gazed no more around him, but went directly onward, looking—and that, too, gloomily—upon the ground, toward the speaker's chair. But the stern democrat, as conscious that his genius had prevailed, cast his eyes round him with an air of loftier and more sublimated feeling than Edgar had as yet observed him wear. It was a trifle at the period when it passed, and none but he have noticed or recorded it; but after times and after deeds stamped it, no more to be erased, upon the tablets of his inmost soul. Meanwhile the king had reached the chair; and Lenthall, the bold speaker, who had hitherto sat still, as proud and far more placid than his visiter, arose, and stepped out stately and cold to meet him. Then the king mounted to his place, and stood upon the step, but spake not, nor sat down; and there he stood, gloomily gazing on the house, with a dark look of sullen anger, for many minutes—and after he had looked a great while—“Gentlemen,” he said, in a high voice, clearly audible, though neither musical nor pleasing, to the most distant corner— “Gentlemen of the Commons, I am sorry for this my cause of coming to you. Yesterday I did send a sergeant to demand some, who, by my order, were accused of treason. Instead of prompt obedience, I received—a message!” and he uttered the last word with the most concentrated scorn and insolence—“I must, then, here declare to you, that though no king that ever was in England could be more careful of your privileges than I have been —and shall be—yet, I can tell you, treason hath no privilege!—and therefore am I come to tell you that I must have these men, and will, wherever I may find them!” And, as he spoke, he looked around the hall with a deliberate air, scanning the faces of all present, if he might find his men; then, raising his voice higher yet, he called aloud, till the roof rang again—“Ho! I say, Master Hollis!— Master Pym!” No answer was returned, nor any sound; save an increased and angry tumult in the lobby, with a brandishing of partisans and a producing of concealed but ready pistols, so that some members thought to see the soldiers instantly rush into the chamber. After a little pause, finding he got no answer, he turned to the speaker—“Say,” he exclaimed—“say, Mr. Speaker, be any of these men here present?” For a moment Lenthall paused, as doubting whether to hurl his own defiance and that of the assembled commons into his very teeth; but, ere the echoes of the monarch's voice had ceased, he had resolved upon the wiser and more prudent part, and bending, with most deferential courtesy, his knee—“I have, sir,” he replied, “nor eyes to see, nor tongue to speak in this place, save as this house, whose servant I am sworn, shall order me. And therefore must I pray your majesty to pardon me that I return no farther answer!” “Ha! sir,” returned Charles, sharply, and with incipient fury—but a moment's thought convinced him that the humble answer of the speaker defied at once and rendered hopeless any charge or violence against him. “Ha! sir,” again he said, but in a milder tone—“I do believe my eyes are to the full as good as yours, and I do see my birds are flown; but this I tell you, and so look ye to it—I hold this house to send them to me! Failing of which, I shall myself go seek them! For, sirs, their treason is most foul, and such as you shall thank me, all of you, now to discover. And I assure you—on a king's word I assure you—I never O 2 did mean any violence, and they shall have fair trial —I meant not any other!” He waited not for farther words; perchance he doubted what reply he might receive to this last false asseveration —palpably, unquestionably false—for wherefore brought he his disbanded soldiery, his rude and ruffian bravoes, with rapier, partisan, and pistol, into the very precincts of the house? Wherefore, unless he had designed to hale the accused members violently forth by the strong arm of tyrannous authority? Stepping down from the chair, he walked, uncovered still, but at a quicker pace than that with which he entered, toward the lobby; but now, as he departed, his looks were not turned haughtily from side to side, but sadly bent upon the floor; nor was his passage silent as before—for member after member started up as Charles went past him, with bent brow and clinched hand; and groans both loud and deep saluted him. As he came nigh the seat of Cromwell, the king raised his visage, haggard now and pale, as with an anxious curiosity to look upon the man before whose eye he felt himself to have recoiled—and, as he met it, Oliver sprang upon his feet, his long tuck rattling in the scabbard as he rose, and, stamping on the floor with fury, shouted aloud, in tones not mild nor measured, the word “Privilege!” A dozen voices took it up, though not so loudly nor with so marked defiance as the first daring speaker, and the whole house was in the wildest and most uncontrolled confusion. Delightedly would the despotic prince, had he but dared it, at that moment have cried ON! —have given the word, expected by his myrmidons, for massacre and havoc—have bid the swords, which were already thirsting in their scabbards, leap forth and drink their fill of that most noble blood of England. But, thanks to Heaven, he dared not! There would have been no object worthy of the risk—no gain to justify the detestation he would have so heaped upon his head! He did not dare; and therefore, smothering for the time his virulent and vengeful fury, he departed— the door rang heavily behind him; and with no muttered curses on the head of him who lacked the spirit to perform what he and they yearned equally to execute, frustrate of their desired vengeance, unsatisfied and balked, his hireling desperadoes filed out from the venerable walls their presence had so shamefully polluted. CHAPTER X. “He hath gone forth! Not with the gorgeous majesty sublime Of marshalled hosts—not with the brazen din Of trumps sonorous—but heart-sick and sad, Despairing and dishonoured! He hath gone— Gone—that his place shall never know him more— Cursed of his people—outcast from his throne— A dim, discrowned king!” The night fell dark as Hades, and tempestuous withal. The winds wailed mournfully at intervals, at intervals shrieked out with savage fury; and as the giant clouds were driven reelingly across the firmament, blotting the faint light of the winking stars, fierce bursts of hail and rain came dashing to the earth, and ceased as suddenly as they commenced. And ever and anon the thunder growled remotely, but with a sullen rolling that seemed almost continuous, such was the length and frequency of the strong peals—and lightnings flashed on every side the heaven, now in broad, quivering sheets of ghastly light, that transiently displayed the ragged edges of each fleeting storm-cloud in distinct relief, and now in wavy lines of most intense and life-like fire, rushing athwart the rack from zenith to horizon. Yet, turbulent as was the night aloft the city, and ominous as showed the gathering of the elements, still more alarming was the turbulence that reigned in the full streets, and more portentous was the concourse of the armed and angry citizens. The train-bands had been mustered in the early evening, with arquebuse and pike, their lighted matches gleaming on all sides through the murky darkness, and the heavy trampling of their companies everywhere audible, as they marched to and fro, vainly desirous to allay the tumult which had arisen instantly on the arrival of the accused members, seeking protection in the guarded precincts of the city. From sunset until dawn the mayor patrolled the streets with his assistant magistrates, vainly endeavouring to quell the terrified and savage populace, with whom each court and alley, from the purlieus of Alsatia quite to the Tower, was blockaded and beset—all armed as chance had ordered it, some with the perfect implements of modern warfare, others with weapons obsolete and strange, brown-bills, and glaives, and maces. Chains were made fast athwart the most frequented avenues; and barricades of stone and timber, heaped rudely but effectively together, above which yawned the mouth of many a ponderous cannon, would have presented no small obstacles to any who should dare invade the sacred limits of the city. Huge bonfires blazed in every quarter, torches and flambeaux streamed and wavered in each gust of wind, casting a singular and ruddy glare upon the pallid faces and unusual weapons of the unwashed artisans who formed the bulk of the assemblage; though they were mingled here and there with grave and well-attired burghers, their morions and gorgets wildly at variance with their civic garbs and golden chains —with young and ruffling templars, to whom aught savouring of frolic or of fight was most congenial —and with sad-visaged and morose soldadoes, in suits of buff, tarnished and soiled by service, girded with broad-swords of unwieldy length, fresh from the German wars or the Low Countries, then, as in every after age, the battle-field of Europe—all keeping up, throughout the livelong night, a dissonance of tongues as loud and jarring as ever rent the air around the heaven-defying Babel. At times a sudden panic would run through the crowd, none knowing whom to trust or whom to flee—a cry would ring above the mingled din—“The cavaliers! The cavaliers! Fly! Fly! The king and his wild cavaliers are up to fire the city!” and, without waiting to inquire or to hear, the mob would rush they knew not whither, trampling the aged and the feeble under foot, and turning oftentimes the very weapons they had belted on to guard their liberties against each other in the blind and reeling rout. And now, with words of fire and gestures of defiance, some bolder spirit would brave the panic-stricken throng, and rally it and lead it back, with brandished arms and inflamed features, to meet the foemen who existed only in their imaginations, maddened with terror and excitement. Nor was the panic and confusion slighter within the royal palace. Between the hapless king and his perfidious consort, distrust—recrimination— wrath—followed by feigned repentance on the one hand—uxorious pardon on the other! Among the counsellors, dismay and doubt—high words, and mutual reproaches, and all the vehement disorder that ensues on the adoption and discomfiture of evil counsels! Digby and Lunsford wearying Charles, faint-hearted now and dubious, for permission to assail the city gates, and drag the impeached traitors forth from their stronghold at point of partisan and pike!—Others deploring the rash steps already taken, and protesting against farther violence!— and some, the nobler and more upright spirits— Falkland, and Hyde, and their associates—holding themselves aloof in deep, resentful sorrow, that all their wisdom had been wasted, and themselves distrusted and deceived. Never a longer night was followed by a sadder morning; for, although daylight calmed the terror and the tumult, it allayed nothing of the concentrated wrath, diminished nothing of the jealous apprehensions entertained by either party. After a short debate, the parliament, both lords and commons, adjourned for several days, appointing a committee to sit constantly, mornings and afternoons, at Merchants' Hall, within the city walls, where they might be secure from farther outrage, and free to devise means for vindication of their members, and safeguard of their violated rights. Edgar, informed of the commotions, and anxious for the safety of the city, called for his horse the moment after the adjournment, and, with some six or seven followers, well mounted and equipped, rode up the Strand—a scattered street at that day, occupied by the suburban dwellings of the rich and noble, with terraced gardens sloping downward to the Thames—full of calm resolution, and intending instantly to volunteer his aid for putting down the riots, and establishing some governance of law. When he reached Temple-Bar the gates were closed with bolt and chain, a powerful band of musketeers, with gun and bandoleers, manning its loops, and mustering at every window that overlooked the area before it. But, at announcement of his quality and name, the bolts were drawn, the heavy leaves unfolded, and he entered amid presented arms and muttered greetings of the sentinels. With a pleased eye he saw at once that order was restored; suspicion still prevailed, and vigilance, but tumult and confusion had given way to wise and watchful regulation. The shops were shut, and business was suspended, it is true, and all men who went forth wore weapons; but the trained-bands patrolled the streets, with magistrates at the head of every company, no less to enforce internal quiet than to resist external force. Scarce had he ridden twenty yards within the gate ere a fresh summons roused the wardens, and a king's messenger, after some parley, was admitted, and conducted by a file of infantry to hearing of the aldermen, then sitting at the Guildhall. The business on which Ardenne came directing him to the same quarter, and strong anxiety to learn the future movements of the court still farther prompting him, he at once wheeled to the rear of this small band, and, passing onward with them, was ushered in without delay to the mayor's presence, and, in consideration of his place in parliament, accomodated with a seat whence he might witness the proceedings of the day, and lend his counsel, if need were, to these the magnates of the city. To his astonishment, as to that, indeed, of all, the messenger announced that his majesty was already entering his coach to wait upon the mayor, when he had left Whitehall; and that he prayed that dignitary to call a common council on the instant. Sir Richard Gourney, the then holder of that office, although inclined not slightly to the principles of the decided royalists, disclaiming, as did all the wiser of the party, any participation in, or knowledge of, a course which, now that it had failed, they all professed to disapprove, was careful to display no symptom of subserviency; perhaps, indeed, he truly felt that wrong had been committed, and was sincere, as he was evidently faithful to his trust, in the determination to maintain inviolate the privileges of which he was the guardian. The council was at the time in session, and scarcely had the messenger withdrawn before the king arrived—not with the armed and dissolute attendants who had convoyed him to the halls of parliament, but with some two or three lords only, and those of the most moderate among his partisans. The shouts that ran like wildfire along the crowded streets, mingled with groans and yells—the cries, “Privilege! Privilege of parliament!”—announced his presence at the doors of the Guildhall before he had alighted from his coach, and clearly proved the temper of the now thoroughly-aroused and fearless multitude; while, as a token of the perfect mastery of the law even at that moment of tremendous and wellnigh unparalleled excitement, a daring pamphlet-writer, who had thrown into the monarch's coach a paper, bearing inscribed the scriptural watchword, “To your tents, O Israel,” was instantly committed for contempt. The city dignitaries rose indeed from their seats on the king's entrance; they tendered to him all—all, to the most minute particulars—that was his due of reverence and ceremonial greeting; but there was no heart-inspired applause—no loyal, spirit-stirring cry, “God save the king!”—no smile—no welcome! Strange it may seem, yet he had hoped indeed, infatuated man, that he should now succeed in gaining the authorities to yield their honoured guests to his demand; and so commenced what he esteemed a mild, conciliatory harangue, requiring their surrender—full of false statements of his veneration and regard, in all past time, for England's laws and liberties—of his affection for the Protestant religion—of his enforcement of the penal statutes against the dreaded papists—and no less full of promises, unmeaning, insincere, and empty, concerning his intentions for the future. Little applause and no obedience followed! Baffled a second time, and yet more deeply mortified, he left the Guildhall—but, desirous still of pleasing, and imagining, short-sighted and deluded prince, that, by a slender show of condescension, he could efface the recollection of so many arbitrary acts against the corporate and individual interests of the city, he vouchsafed to one—the worse affected toward his person—of the sheriffs the honour of dining at his house;—was served, together with his retinue, with more than courtly luxury—with all respect and honour, paid, not to himself, but to the station which he so ill occupied—but with no semblance of that glad alacrity, that honest and ungrudging heart-service, which is well worth a world of bended knees and hollow ceremonial;—and in the evening—harassed in spirit and fatigued in body, irritated by the reproachful hootings of the multitude that jarred, at every instant of his homeward progress, on his reluctant ear, and hopeless now of compassing his tyrannical ends—retired to his palace, there to give impotent and childish vent to his indignant spleen, by publishing a proclamation against all men who should presume to harbour or conceal the persons whom he had previously denounced as traitors. Days passed away; each marked by some bold resolution of the commons — by increased tokens of the deep respect and admiration entertained by the great bulk of the metropolis toward Vol. I.—P the vindicators of its rights—and by some weak and useless aggravation of his former measures on the part of the misguided and wife-governed monarch. A week had scantly rolled above their heads, before the house, conscious of its own strength, and knowing the entire impotence of the king's party, determined to bring back their members to Westminster, as being men against whom no legitimate or constitutional charge was pending; and preparation of unwonted splendour and extent was made for reconducting them in triumph to their seats. The news might not escape the ears of Charles, bruited as it was all joyously abroad through every class of persons, and pleasing as it was to nearly all—for not a few, even of those who heretofore had backed him with their voices and opinions in all his troubles, and who in after days as faithfully assisted him with life and fortune, were not entirely sorry for the occurrence of a marked reverse, which might, they fondly hoped, avail to check him in his inordinate and reckless cravings—cravings which, to their own eyes, they could not now disguise or palliate—for power, unconstitutional at least, if not tyrannical and absolute. Bitter—most bitter—were his feelings, as he went, ungreeted by one loyal acclamation—his absence unlamented by one loyal tear—forth from the palace of his fathers—almost alone in actual fact, but absolutely so in sentiment—the queen, for whose sake mainly he had embroiled himself with his true-hearted subjects, ungratefully and spitefully upbraiding him, not for the folly of his measures, but for his failure in their execution—his courtiers, who had urged him on to every fresh aggression, and lauded every new caprice, now silent and dejected—and the very guards who rode before his coach dispirited and crest-fallen. Bitter—most bitter—were his feelings; but it was not with the bitterness of manly and upright repentance—not with the bitterness upspringing from the sense of wrong committed, and resulting in a promise of amendment—but with the bitterness of discontent and disappointment, of unholy wishes frustrated, and merited reverses sullenly remembered. Such were the feelings of that bad monarch and unhappy man as he drove forth—that so he might avoid the triumph of his disaffected subjects—after the shades of early evening had already gathered dark and cold about the misty streets, toward Hampton Court, as virtually exiled from the metropolis of his oppressed and groaning country, and from the jeoparded, dishonoured throne of his forefathers, as from the hearts of his once loving subjects. But the sun rose upon a nobler and more glorious spectacle—a spectacle rife with great blessings for the present, and brilliant omens for the future —the spectacle of a vast people, free and united! victorious, not by the sword, nor over slain and mutilated carcasses—but by the strength of popular opinion, founded on the broad base of justice—animated by the deathless love of liberty—and directed by such a knot of patriots as England in no other age had witnessed! On came the fair procession, marshalled by loud, triumphant music, and the yet louder shouts of honest and exulting myriads; gay with a thousand flags and banners flaunting to the wintry sun, which wore, on that proud morning, his brightest and most gorgeous aspect; guarded by all the sober strength of civil discipline, and all the orderly and bright array of the well-trained militia of the city; not fluttering, indeed, with tasselled scarfs or many-coloured plumes, but well equipped with morions of steel, polished till they shone out like silver, and stout buff-coats, all service-like and uniform—with their puissant pikes thick as a grove of pines, their broad heads glinting back the sunbeams — and arquebuses clearly burnished as when they left the armory. Fifty in front they marched, in close and serried order, striding along with regular and sturdy steps, rank after rank, each as a single man—with that erect, undaunted bearing which belongs only to the free; and with the tranquil eye and calm though proud expression which mark the disciplined, law-loving citizen, and not the fierce, unruly democrat. The companies were all arrayed beneath the civic banners of their respective wards, and headed by their captains, mounted well on strong and serviceable chargers, and gallantly equipped in scarlet cassocks and steel corslets. Behind this stately host, preceded by the bearers of his mace and sword, and all the glittering insignia of city pomp, Sir Richard Gourney rode along, curbing a splendid courser, whose footcloth, blazoned with rich armorial bearings, almost swept the ground, sorely, as it would seem, against his will, to slow procession pace; then, two and two, in flowing robes of scarlet, with chains of gold about their necks, and tall white feathers floating above their velvet bonnets, the sheriffs and the aldermen advanced!—and then, received by acclamations that were heard for many a mile around, clad in their ordinary garbs, and wearing in their grave demeanour no tokens of undue importance or unfitting exultation, the denounced patriots rode steadily along; and, headed by their speaker, the whole house of commons followed. No banners waved above them—no gorgeous dresses pointed them for public admiration —no high assumption called the eye to them—yet, as they swept slowly forward, a band of gentlemen —mostly of noble, all of reputable birth—chosen for worth and wisdom to be the delegates of a great people—of a people the most manly, and intelligent, and free of the wide universe—they could not but have attracted the eye and fixed the untaught admiration of the most stolid or most slavish; what then must they have done when they were passing before those whose liberties they had asserted at the risk of all that men hold dear? Close trooping in the rear of these another strong battalion of the train-bands marched—several brigades of field artillery, huge, cumbrous iron guns, with tumbrils following and matches lighted, rattled and groaned over the rugged pavements, and a long train of well-appointed horse of each denomination then in use—the heavy cuirassiers, with helmets, breast and back pieces, poldrons and taslets of bright polished steel, bearing long two-edged broad-swords, and pistolets with barrels full two feet in length—mounted arquebusiers, with short but ponderous matchlocks and formidable rapiers—lancers, with no defensive arms save morion and gorget, and no weapons save their spears of fifteen feet and light curved sabres, in imitation of the Polish horse, already celebrated in the German wars—a splendid cavalcade, brought up the rear. While thousands and tens of thousands—strong men and tottering children, matrons and hoary-headed sires, and maidens delicate and tender— the vast population of the city and its suburbs poured out to meet their champions, hindering their progress by their living masses, and clinging even to the horses they bestrode, with fervent prayers and blessings, and with tears of holy joy, and waving kerchiefs, and exulting shouts, to greet the people's friends; and with wild curses on the king and on his cavaliers, concerning whom P 2 they oft and sneeringly inquired, “Where be they now, and whither have they fled?” Meanwhile adown the Thames another pomp was floating, toward the stairs at Westminster, second, if second, only to the landward show—hundreds of lighters, pinnaces, and long-boats, dressed up with waist-cloths and with streamers, laden with musketry and ordnance, manned by a host of British mariners, whose meteor flag even then “had braved, a thousand years, the battle and the breeze,” furrowed the broad and placid river; while ever and anon the salvos of their cannon, thundering above the din and clamours of the mighty concourse, announced to the disheartened monarch, even in his sad retreat at Hampton, the failure of his insolent aggressions, and the triumphant testimony borne by his indignant subjects to the untiring efforts and undaunted resolution of those noble spirits, whom his oppressive madness had converted, step by step, from the most steady guardians to the most constant foemen of his person and his crown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK II. “They have drawn to the field Two royal armies, full of fiery youth; Of equal spirit to dare, and power to do: So near intrenched, that 'tis beyond all hope Of human counsel they can e'er be severed, Until it be determined by the sword Who hath the better cause; for the success Concludes the victor innocent, and the vanquished Most miserably guilty.” Massinger —The Duke of Milan. CHAPTER I. “Mal.—Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there Weep our sad bosoms empty. Macd.—Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men Bestride our downfallen birthdom.” Shakspeare —Macbeth. A YEAR had passed since Ardenne's landing on his native shores, unfixed of purpose, and, above all, an advocate for peace!—a year in which events had taken place that rendered hopeless all accommodation between the hostile parties, until one should have been proved decidedly superior. The very day on which the king had fled from London, lest he should witness the return of the five members to the house, having been signalized by a most wild and ill-digested movement of the fiery Lunsford, sufficiently disclosed the intentions of the royalists in an attempt to seize a magazine of arms at Kingston. Then came the treachery of Goring— the king's fruitless effort against Hull—the calling out of the militia—the arming on both sides—and all the small guerrilla skirmishes that were occurring daily for some months previous to the nominal commencement of the war. The queen, who had escaped to Holland, stealing and bearing with her the crown jewels, which were pawned at once to furnish arms, and men, and money, was setting every spring in motion on the continent. Rupert and Maurice had arrived in England, and the former was, on his first interview, appointed general of the cavalry. The royal standard had been raised, some two months past, at Nottingham, with evil omens, and under auspices the most unfavourable—a mighty tempest having poured its fury on the gathering of the troops, dispirited and few in number, and unfurnished with the most evident and indispensable equipments of an army—weapons, and clothes, and ammunition. The flag itself, displaying, in addition to the wonted quarterings of England, a small escutcheon, charged with the royal bearings and the crown, and compassed by a scroll, with the proud motto, “Render his due to Cesar!” was scarcely elevated ere a heavier gust of wind, accompanied with floods of rain and a fierce crash of thunder, shivered the staff in twain, and dashed the ensign violently to the ground; while such was the increasing fury of the tempest that two whole days elapsed before it could be reared again. Still, although by this overt act the king had most unquestionably issued his appeal to the sword as to the sole remaining arbiter, matters went on but heartlessly and slowly. Each side, averse to throw away the scabbard, paused in a grim and terrible suspense, irreconcileably hostile to the other, yet unwilling to incur the blame of being first to strike, or foremost to refuse accommodation. The royal forces, far too weak to court the brunt of battle, aimlessly marched and countermarched, levying contributions in this place, and mustering volunteers in that; while the superior party of the parliament, already strong enough to have surprised and crushed the royalists at a single blow, lay in their quarters, waiting, as it would seem, till they should muster resolution to commence hostilities. The truth, which has been strangely overlooked by all historians of these turbulent and most important times, was simply this —that, in the outset of that fearful strife, there was but little difference between the views, and hopes, and fears of the most eminent and upright men of either party. How it should ever have been fancied, much less gravely argued, that the great body of the English gentry and nobility were anxious to subvert the constitution, which had been freed from the arbitrary power of the Norman princes by the sole efforts of their order, and to erect an absolute and unchecked despotism, which must have necessarily ruined their own caste, it is most difficult indeed to comprehend or to conjecture. Nor is it less absurd to hold that the more liberal peers, who, neither few in number nor deficient in sagacity, were enlisted on the people's side, were in the least degree prepared to overthrow that ancient monarchy from which they all derived their greatness, and to descend at once from their exalted grade to mere equality with their less elevated countrymen. In simple fact, the leading men of either party dreaded defeat or victory with a nearly equal apprehension; knowing that such an overthrow befalling either host, as should conclude the other absolutely masters of the game, would be most hopelessly destructive to the liberties of England. It was then in this spirit that the counsellors of Charles, scarcely more fearful of reverses which should deliver them a prey to their stern foemen, than of success which would inflame and aggravate the monarch's native haughtiness, laboured, with all their powers, to bring about some reconciliation; but in vain, their every effort being frustrated by the imbecile insincerity and double-dealing of their principal! At length, when the last hopes were quenched of peace unbought by victory, the fiery Rupert, who, from the first, had been the open advocate of instant battle, acting with indefatigable and almost sleepless energy, collected horses, men, and cannon from the northern and the midland counties, until the royal army amounted to the number of ten thousand—three foot brigades under Sir Jacob Astley, and the Earl of Lindsey, an officer experienced in the wars of the Low Countries—three dragoon regiments, to act as horse or infantry as need might be, under Sir Arthur Aston—Lord Bernard Stuart commanding the king's guards, a troupe dorée, composed entirely of gentlemen, whose annual incomes are said to have exceeded the united fortunes of all the members who, at the outbreaking of the war, were voters in both houses —a good park of artillery, under the trusty Sir John Heydon—and the adventurous prince—himself a host—leading the cavalry, consisting of the very flower of the youthful gentry, practised in arms, and high in chivalrous and daring spirit. Then, early in October, having resolved to strike a blow, and anxious to give battle to his enemies, the king marched hastily from Shrewsbury upon the capital. Meantime the Earl of Essex, who had been recently appointed by the parliament their general-in-chief, left the metropolis with an array some fifteen thousand strong, more thoroughly equipped and better armed than were the gentlemen of the opposing host, but far inferior to them in that sustained and burning spirit, which is of more avail than tenfold numbers in the day of battle. The earl's instructions were to tender to the king a joint petition of the houses—beseeching him to leave the gathering of malignants, whose ill counsels had so far prevailed to alienate him from his loving subjects, and to repair at once to the vicinity of his Vol. I.—Q most loyal parliament—and, in the case that this petition should prove of none effect, to rescue him, by force of arms, from the foul traitors who surrounded and misled him. To this intent, he was provided with all the requisites that constitute an army—a heavy train of well-arranged artillery, with ammunition and supplies of all kinds in profuse abundance—a powerful brigade of horse, under the Earl of Bedford and Sir William Balfour; and a picked body of the London train-bands, well disciplined and admirably well appointed! Among the numerous nobles who accompanied the general of the parliament, two, perhaps, merit an especial notice—the young lords Rochford and Feilding— as being destined soon to meet, as foemen in the shock of battle, their own fathers, the earls of Dover and of Denbigh, who were enrolled as volunteers in the king's guard of horse! Many there were, indeed, in this array, who yielded not in spirit or in valour to the proudest cabalier of Charles!— many who panted for the onset with all the patriotic zeal of freemen trampled and oppressed—with all the bitter and fanatic rancour of religious prejudice—and these were more than matches for the best of Rupert's soldiery!—but more were doubtful, and reluctant, and affected by the cold and backward spirit of their leaders, who felt, perhaps, a secret apprehension that, in battling for the liberty and constitution of their land, they might in some degree be warring with the interests of their order. Such was the aspect of affairs, and such the state of parties, when, on a brilliant morning toward the last days of October, a gallant regiment of horse was winding through the deep green lanes and devious woodlands of Northampton toward the little town of Keinton, distant, perhaps, some twenty miles, at which it was beginning to be understood that Essex had established his headquarters. An animating spectacle they formed, and lively, as they gleamed out and disappeared among the lofty hedges and dense coppices, still glorious in the leafy garniture of variegated autumn, their polished armour glinting back the cloudless sunshine in long and dazzling flashes, their colours fluttering in the cheerful breeze, their videttes warily surveying every thicket, the matches of their arquebuses ready kindled, and their extended lines sweeping along the irregular wood-roads in serpentine and wavy order—pausing at every brook or dell where they might possibly be set upon at disadvantage, until their advanced guard should fall back with tidings that their path was unobstructed—and varying their array from open file to solid column, as the nature of the ground might dictate. The leader of this splendid body was a fine-looking figure, in the prime of life, well formed and stately, and far above the ordinary height of men. He wore a military coat of strong buff leather, garnished with fringe of tawny silk three inches broad, and loops of golden braid, partially covered by a breast-plate and its corresponding back-piece, polished till they shone bright as silver. He had no gorget, but a rich cravat of Flanders lace, with long, transparent ends, half veiling the clear steel on which it fell. His dark curled hair flowed down his neck beneath the rim of a steel cap or morion, exquisitely damasked, but without crest or feather; his hands were guarded by high gauntlets, and his lower limbs by breeches of the same material, similarly ornamented with his cassock, and strong jack-boots that would have set a sabre-cut at naught. His sword, a two-edged, basket-hilted rapier of uncommon length, hung from an orange-coloured scarf, betokening his adherence to the parliament —its army having adopted for their badge that colour from the ancient liveries of Essex, as the cavaliers had assumed for their distinctive uniform black feathers and blue shoulder-knots—although the fashion of his garments and the general bearing of the wearer were more in character with the demeanour and the principles of their opponents, than of those stern and gloomy fanatics who are so generally and so erroneously believed to have composed the great numerical strength of the liberal, or —to speak more justly—constitutional party. The animal he rode, a mare of splendid action, symmetry, and size, was evidently a practised charger, and accoutred, as became one, with demipique and holsters, and all that goes to the equipment of a war-horse. In these minutiæ, no less than in the accurate array and perfect discipline of the tall, hardy-looking youths who rode along behind him in the strictest silence—in the condition and the bitting of the horses—and, above all, in the cool intelligence with which he listened to the varying reports of his subordinates, the quick, decisive firmness which made known, and the prompt energy which carried out, his orders—might be discovered at a glance the officer of many actions!— the soldier on whose mind no lesson of experience had been lost, until his very nature was no more the same; that which was once an effort—once the result of intricate and thoughtful calculation, arising now from an intuitive foreknowledge, more like the wondrous instinct of an animal than the deep reasoning combinations of a man! It lacked, perhaps, an hour of noon when this detachment, having extricated itself, without so much as hearing of an enemy, from the wide tracts of woodland, portions of which may still be seen in the adjacent counties of Huntingdon and Bedford, had reached the summit of a considerable eminence; which, falling away steeply toward the west, commanded an extensive view over the velvet pastures of Northampton, checkered with cornfields and dark tracts of fallow—with many a whitewashed cottage peering from out the foliage of its orchards, and many a village steeple, with its mossy graves and tufted yew-trees, and here and there some castellated mansion, scarce seen amid its shadowy plantations — stretching away till they were bounded far to westward by the blue hills of Warwickshire. Just on the brow of the declivity there stood a large and isolated farm, with stabling and outhouses sufficient to accommodate a hundred head of cattle; upon the green before it the leader of the party drew his bridle, and, after a quick glance across the champaign at his feet, and another toward the sun, which had already passed its height, entering the dwelling, held short consultation with the sturdy yeoman who possessed the fertile acres. Before five minutes had elapsed he issued from the lowly doorway, ordering his party to dismount and pile their arms, and take what brief refreshment the farmhouse might offer during an hour's halt. A hasty bustle followed, as down the troopers sprang with jingling spur and scabbard, and merriment suppressed no longer by the rigid discipline enforced upon the march—no oaths, however, or profane and Godless clamours were heard, disgracing equally the officers who tolerated and the men who uttered them. Gayety there was, and decent, sober mirth, but naught of hoisterous, much less licentious revelling. Videttes were stationed on commanding points, patrols detailed—and then, the horses picketed and well supplied with provender, fires were lighted, and canteens produced with all their savoury Q 2 stores; and the men, stretched at length on the smooth greensward, chatted and laughed as gayly over their hurried meal as though they were engaged in some exciting sylvan exercise, and not in the tremendous toil of warfare. The hour allotted for their stay had wellnigh passed—when, from their farther outpost, a horseman galloped in, bloody with spurring, and, driving through the scattered groups, flung his rein heedlessly upon his charger's neck, and turned him loose before the door—while, with an air betokening the consciousness of bearing high and stern intelligence, he hastened to convey his tidings to his officer. There needed not, however, words to tell the men that danger was at hand! A moment's anxious gaze at the vidette, and the jest ceased, the flagon was suspended ere it reached the thirsty lip, the laugh was not laughed out! Another moment, and the fires were all deserted—the remnants of the meal laid hastily aside—horses, recruited by their feed, were bridled—swords buckled on, and helmets braced, and firearms inspected; and, ere their leader came again among them, in anxious conversation with the messenger, they waited to mount only till the ready trumpets should sound boot and saddle! “Get you to horse!” he said—“get you to horse as silently as may be! But spare your breath,” he added, turning abruptly to the bugler, who was already handling his instrument, “till it be needed for a charge, which, an' we be so lucky as I deem we are, it may be—and right early! Sir Edmund Winthrop, have your men into line as speedily as may be; but move not until farther signal! My charger, Anderton — and let a sergeant's guard mount instantly! I go to reconnoitre—a bugler with the party. Soh! Steady, men, steady!”—and, without farther pause, he leaped into his saddle and, followed by the small detachment, galloped at a fierce pace down the hill-side, rugged and broken as it was, in company with the patrol who had brought in the tidings. Close to the bottom of the hill whereon the troops were halting there ran a deep and hollow gorge, cutting across the road which they had kept thus far directly at right angles, and screened from observation on the upper side by a long, straggling belt of furze and underwood, with here and there a huge and weather-beaten oak or glossy beech, forming the outskirts of a heavy mass of forest that fringed, for several miles in length, the extreme left of the level country across which their line of march would lead them. Through this gorge, as the sentinel reported, a powerful force of cavalry was moving toward the causeway at scarcely two miles distance; but whether friends or foes he might not, as he said, determine. Checking his charger at the junction of the roads, the officer dismounted; and, taking off his head-piece lest its glitter should betray him, stole forward through the trees to a high sandstone bluff commanding the whole gorge. From this he instantly discovered the approaching troops, who had so nearly come upon him unawares. There were at least five hundred horse in view, all cuirassiers completely cased in steel, escorting, as it seemed, a strong brigade of field artillery. When first they had been seen by the vidette, they were emerging from the forest-land alluded to before, and had attempted, as he said, a cross-road visible from the hill-side; but it had proved so miry, as he judged from the slow progress of the guns, that they had countermarched, and were advancing steadily, as now beheld, under the guidance of a countryman who rode beside their leader, toward the sandy gorge by which they evidently hoped to gain the practicable road. Earnestly did the wary partisan gaze on the glittering columns, searching their movements, and examining their dress and arms with eager scrutiny, and ever and anon sweeping the country in their rear with an inquiring glance, that seemingly expected father indications from that quarter. But it was all in vain! The regiment in view wore neither scarfs, nor any badge that might inform him of their politics or party—their colours were all furled around the staves and cased in oil-skin—and all, from which he might in anywise conjecture of whether host they formed a portion, was the exact and veteran discipline their movements indicated—far too exact, as he supposed from the reports prevailing through the country, for the tumultuary levies of the Puritans. The hollow way on which they were advancing opened, at a mile's distance, on the plain, and it appeared that the new-comers were about to enter it unthinking of surprise, and confident, perhaps, in their own power. “If they be foes, we have them!” cried the partisan. “Back, Anderton, back to the regiment—ride for your life! —tell Major Armstrong to lead down three troops— dismounted, with their arquebuses ready, and their matches lighted—beneath the cover of yon dingle on the hill-side till he shall reach this gorge, then line it with his musketry! Let Anstruther wheel, with three more, about yon round-topped hillock— in half an hour he may debouche upon the plain— or sooner, if he hear our shot—and charge upon the rear of yon horse-regiment—they will be in the trap ere then! Sir Edmund Winthrop will lead down the rest by the same road we came—I tarry him! Away! Be swift and silent! Away! for more than life is on your speed!” and, with the word, the subaltern dashed furiously away, spurning the pebbles high into the air at every bound, and instantly was lost to sight behind the angle of the sandy banks, while he who had commanded, after another wistful gaze toward the approaching squadron, returned with leisurely and quiet steps to his good charger. With his own hands he drew the girths more tight, looked to each strap and buckle of his rein and stirrups, patted her arched crest with a fleeting smile, and mounting, rode, with half a dozen followers, sharply along the gorge, as if to meet the strangers, who now seemed disposed to pause upon the plain, and reconnoitre, ere they should enter a defile so perilous and narrow. Just at this moment—while a score or two of troopers rode out from the advanced guard of the horse, which had now halted, and warily dispersing themselves among the broken ground, began to beat the thickets with deliberate and jealous scrutiny—a low, stern hum arose from the dark corps of cuirassiers—increasing still and swelling on the ear, till it was clearly audible for a full mile around, a burst of deep-toned, manly voices—harsh perhaps in themselves, and tuneless, but harmonized by distance and the elastic atmosphere on which they floated, till they were blended at least into a solemn and melodious sound. Louder they rose, and louder on the breeze, and now were answered by a faint and dream-like echo from out the dim aisles of the forest in their rear, among the leafy screens of which the arms and standards of another and another band might fitfully be seen to glitter. It was the soul-inspiring crash of sacred music, the peal of choral voices untaught and undirected, save by the impulse of a thousand hearts attuned to one high key of patriotic piety—unmixed with instruments of wind or string—a deep, sonorous diapason—the soldier's anthem to the God of battles and the Lord of Hosts! “Arise! arise!” the mighty sound went forth, its every syllable distinctly audible to the excited listener— “Arise! arise!—oh God—our God—arise! Ride on in might, in terror, and renown— A kindling flame, their nobles to consume— A two-edged sword, to smite their princes down! “Thou that dost break the arrows and the bow— Thou that dost knap the ashen spear in sunder— Thou, Lord of Hosts, that gav'st the horse his strength, And clothed the volumes of his neck in thunder— “Be thou our rock—our fortress of defence— Our horn of safety, in whose strength we trust— So shall their hosts be chaff before the wind— So shall their thousands grovel in the dust! “So shall our feet be crimson with their blood— Their tongues our dogs shall purple with the same— The fowls of air shall have them for a spoil— Their pride a hissing, and a curse their name! “For not in armour, nor the winged speed Of chargers, do we hope—but only see— By whose great aid their vauntings to outspeed— Most Merciful—most Mighty—only Thee!” Scarce had the first sounds reached the leader's ear, before he checked his mare abruptly—“Walters,” he cried at once, “away with you, and overtake him ere he gain the regiment! These be no enemies, but friends! Let not a troop descend from the hill-side—bid them await me, as they be, in order! Spare not your spurs, nor fear to spoil your horseflesh—we have no time to lose! I well had deemed,” he added, muttering to himself, after the orderly had galloped off with his commands— `I well had deemed their rear was many a mile advanced past this ere now. Pray Heaven that Essex lack not men to hold the king in check, as he is like to do, if that this news be sooth how he hath gathered head toward Keinton and Edgehill!” and, without farther words, he hastened down the road, to be, as soon as he had cleared the first projection of the broken banks, discovered by the reconnoitering party in advance. A dozen carbines were presented on the instant at a short range— “Stand—ho!” “Friends! friends!” he shouted, in reply, but without altering his pace—“can you not see our colours?” waving his orange scarf abroad, as he closed with the foremost trooper. “Stand, friend, then!—if that friend you be— stand, friend, and give the word!” returned the other, gruffly—“stand! or I do profess that I will shoot—yea! shoot thee to the death!” “How now, thou peevish knave,” replied the officer, in high and ireful tones. “Recover instantly thy carbine—marshal me straight unto the leader of you horse! Who is he that commands them?” For a moment's space the grim parliamentarian stubbornly gazed upon the features of the gallant who addressed him, as if reluctant to obey his mandate; but then a gleam of recognition flashed across his sunburnt features—“I crave your pardon,” he said, half abashed; “it is, an' I mistake not, Lieutenant-colonel Ardenne, of the parliament's—” “Lead on, then, sirrah! since thou knowest me,” interrupted Edgar, shortly—“lead on, an' thou wouldst not repent it—and tell me who commands yon horse brigade!” “Stout Colonel Cromwell,” answered the soldier, more respectfully—“stout and courageous Colonel Cromwell! He will, I do believe, rejoice at this encounter. This way, good sir. Yonder he sits on the black horse beside the standard, awaiting our return. Lo you! he sees us, and the files move onward!” And he spoke truly; for, as the cavalry perceived the videttes moving orderly and slowly back, they filed off, troop succeeding troop, toward the entrance of the lane, advancing on a gentle trot in regular and beautiful array. As they passed Ardenne, many a scrutinizing eye perused his figure and equipments, and in most instances a sanctified and solemn sneer disturbed the dark repose of their grave features—called up, as it would seem, by the rich dress and courtly air of the young officer, which, in their wonted parlance, were denounced as “fleshly lusts that war against the soul,” devices of the Evil One, fringes, phylacteries, and trappings of the beast. Nor, in meanwhile, did Edgar turn a heedless or incurious glance toward those with whom, discarding friends and kindred, birthright, and rank, and chivalrous association as things of small avail compared to the great common weal, he had now cast his lot for ever. The first emotion of his mind was deep anxiety—the second wonder—and the third unqualified and unmixed admiration. Never, he thought, in Germany or France—never, among the veteran legions of the Lion of the North, the Protestant Gustavus, had he beheld superior discipline, or men more soldier-like and promising. Mounted on strong black chargers of full sixteen hands in height, their furniture of the most simple kind, but well designed and in the best condition—their iron panoply, corslet, and helm, and taslets, stainless and brilliant—and, above all, their bearing and demeanour—their seats upon their horses, firm yet easy—their muscular and well-developed limbs— their countenances full of resolution, and breathing all—despite the difference of individual character, and the various operations of the same affection on minds of different bias—a strange expression of religious sentiment—solemn in some, and stern, or even sullen—in others wild, fanatical, exalted, and triumphant—yet in all more or less apparent, as evidently forming the great spring and motive of their action. Still, though attentive in the first degree to the essential rules of military discipline, keeping an accurate and well-dressed front, and managing their heavy chargers with precision, there was not any of that deep, respectful silence among these military saints which Edgar had been used to look for in the strictly-ordered service of the Netherlands, and to esteem a requisite of soldiership—but, on the contrary, as every troop rode past him, there was a constant hum of conversation, suppressed, indeed, and low, but still distinctly audible; and he might mark the knotted brows and clinched hands of the vehement disputers, arguing—as it would seem from the decided gestures, and the texts which he occasionally caught lending an elevated savour to their homely language, and, more than all, from the continual appeal to the well-worn and greasy Bibles which each of these stern controversialists bore at his girdle—on questions of religious discipline or points of abstruse doctrine. Although this mixture of the soldier and religionist, this unduc, and, as it seemed to him, irreverent blending of things good and holy with the dreadful trade of blood, jarred painfully on his correct and feeling mind, he could not but acknowledge that this dark spirit of religious zeal, this confidence in their own overweening righteousness, this fixed, unwavering belief that they were the elected and predestined instruments of the Most High—“to execute,” as he could hear them cry aloud, “vengeance upon the heathen and punishment Vol. I.—R upon the people!—to bind their kings in chains and their nobles in fetters of iron!” was indeed a mighty and effective agent to oppose that chivalrous, enthusiastic bravery, that loyal, self-devoting valour which inflamed the highborn army of the cavaliers to deeds of noble daring. Nor did he entertain a doubt, when he perceived the extraordinary person who commanded them, occupied himself in preaching, or expounding rather, the mysterious prophecies of the Old Testament—to which especially the puritans inclined their ear—to an attentive knot of officers, grouped, some upon their horses, and yet more dismounted, around the regimental standard, but that he had some reason far more cogent than mere feelings of devotion for thus encouraging a spirit so unusual in the breasts of his stout followers. The colonel—for to such rank had Cromwell recently been elevated, more even in consideration of the powerful and trusty regiment which he had levied from the freeholders and yeomanry of Huntingdon by his own personal and private influence, than of his services performed already, not either few or inconsiderable, keeping the cavaliers in check, surprising many of their leaders, anticipating all their meditated risings, and cutting off all convoys, whether of money or munitions, throughout the counties of the Eastern Association—the colonel, as he met the eye of Ardenne, was seated on his powerful black war-horse, bestriding him, as it would seem, with giant strength, and perfect mastery of leg and hand, but with an air wholly unmilitary and devoid of ease or grace—sheathed nearly cap-a-piè in armour of bright steel, heavy and exquisitely finished, but utterly without relief or ornament of any kind. A band or collar of plain linen, with a broad hem, fastened about his short Herculean neck, varied alone the stern simplicity of his attire; no feather waved above his low and graceless casque—no shoulder-knot or scarf bedecked his weapon, which was girt about his middle by a belt of buff three inches at the least in width, and balanced on the right side by a formidable dudgeon and the brass-bound case of the familiar Bible, which he now held extended in his left hand, while with the finger of his right he vehemently smote the open pages at each emphatic pause of his discourse. His features showed not now so sanguine or so kindled as when Ardenne last beheld them; but, on the contrary, there was a mild, half-veiled expression about the heavy eye; and, though the lines were strong and marked as ever, there was more of deliberate and quiet resolution than of imperiousness denoted by the firmness of his mouth. It was the countenance, he thought, of a calm visionary, pensive and meditative in his mood, and rather steady in the maintenance of his own fixed opinions than zealous to proscribe or controvert the fancies or the rights of others. But he had little time for noting the expression, changed as he fancied it to be, of his superior, much less for marking the diverse features of the martial auditors—for, as he drew nigh to the spot whereon they stood, Cromwell had ended his discourse, and, with a word or two of military precept, was dismissing his attendants to their several stations. Several dashed past him as he rode up to the little eminence on which the colours were erected, and but two were waiting near the colonel when he reached him—one a bull-necked, coarse-featured, and ungainly-looking person, with a gay feather in his morion, a showy tassel on his rapier's hilt, and a falling collar of some low-priced lace hanging above his gorget—the other an erect and well-made man, not past the prime of youth, with features singularly noble and expressive, though of an almost Spanish swarthiness, and tinctured with a deep and melancholy gravity. “Ha! Master Ardenne!” exclaimed Oliver, his eye joyfully flashing as he recognised him—“right glad am I to see you—not carnally, nor with a worldly-minded and a selfish pleasure, but in that there will be work to do anon, in which the righteous cause shall need all arms of its supporters! Have you a power at hand?—where be they?—in what force?—not travel-worn, I trust me!” “Three hundred horse,” Edgar replied, “on the height yonder—but for those trees you might behold them where we stand! I left them but just now, to reconnoitre your advance, under Sir Edmund Winthrop, my lieutenant.” “Good! good!” cried Cromwell, eagerly; “and how far have you marched to-day—be your men travel-toiled—your steeds leg-weary?—for verily we have a march before us.” “We have but travelled six brief miles this fore-noon, and barely sixteen yesterday—my men are in right spirits, and my horses fresh! I could accomplish twenty miles ere nightfall, and that without fatigue!” “Surely the Lord is gracious,” was the answer —“and of his grace, too, shall we right soon make trial. My Lord of Essex hath, ere now, his post at Keinton—and the man Charles of Stuart hath at length mustered head to face him. 'Tis marvel that they be not at it even now. I fear me the lord general shall lack both horse and cannon; but we have marched already a sore distance with our ponderous guns and heavy armature, nor may I now adventure to press on more hastily without dispersing my command. Ride with me to your regiment, good sir; I trow you were best speedily move forward. Keinton is barely twelve miles distant, and the roads, they tell me, sound and passable;” and, as he spoke, touching his charger lightly with the spur, he broke into a managed canter. “Cornet, advance your colours,” he exclaimed, in short, keen accents, strangely at variance with the monotonous and inexpressive tones of his discourse when unexcited—“sound kettledrums, and march!” and, riding briskly forward, easily passed the troops while filing through the lane. “Halt them here, Ireton,” he said to the dark-favoured officer who had accompanied him, as he turned into the main road, having outstripped the forces—“halt them in column here, within the lane, till I return—and, Desborough, do thou ride back to Hampden's regiment of foot—it is a mile or so in the rear—and bid him bring it up as rapidly as may be. Now, Master Ardenne, I attend you!” As they rode up to Edgar's quarters, Cromwell informed him briefly, and with none of those prolix and verbose sentences with which he was at times accustomed to confuse the senses of his hearers, that he, as senior officer, and therefore in command of the brigade forming Lord Essex's rear guard, was marching up, at his best pace, with his own trusty cavalry, and two—the stoutest—of the parliament's foot-regiments, besides a strong division of field-guns—that, by want of intelligence, the general—as he had learned himself but yesterday —was hastening right upon the king, and, he was fearful, would fall, unawares and unprepared for battle, upon his very outposts! “These tidings I received of a sure hand,” he added, “though whence it needeth not to advertise you. Whom the Lord listeth to enlighten, surely at his own time shall he inform him. But so it is—and it may be that Essex R 2 knoweth not his peril! Wherefore I pray you —ha! be these your men? I do profess to you I hold them stout and soldierly—not like the drunken tapsters and vile turncoat serving-men who—fy on it! that I should say so—do compose the bulk of our array! Truly these fellows shall do credit to the cause—so that the spirit—the right leaven be toward—and the Lord strike on our side! Wherefore I pray you lead them, as swiftly as you find consist with order, upon Keinton. If that they have not yet joined battle, say thus to the lord general, that I beseech him hold off from them so long as he may; I shall be with him by nine of tomorrow's clock. Ha! heard you nothing?” he broke off abruptly, as a deep, distant sound rolled heavily upon the air; and, before Ardenne might reply the sullen rumbling was again repeated, like the faint muttering of a rising thunder-storm, or the premonitory growling of an earthquake. “It was not thunder!” answered Edgar, in the voice of one asserting rather than questioning; “there are no clouds aloft, nor yet on the horizon!” “Ordnance!” exclaimed the other—“ordnance, and heavier, too, than ours! Listen, now listen!” And again the heavy rolling sound came surging down the wind, which freshened slightly from the westward—again it came after a momentary pause, yet loader than before, and more distinct; and then continued without interval the deep, unquestionable voice of a hot cannonade. “Away, sir—God go with you!” cried the stern puritan, excited now beyond the bounds of self-restraint “Tarry not on the way, nor loiter! Gird up your loins, I say. Ride on! ride on, and conquer! Verily, but that it is the Lord's own doing, verily, Edgar Ardenne, I would have envied thee thy fortune. Ride on—thou shalt be yet in time —ride on—amen! Selah!” While he yet spoke, the officers and men, stirred up already by the near sound of battle, and almost maddened with excitement by the exulting and prophetic cries of Cromwell, were vying with each other, these to give forth, those to obey, and almost to anticipate, the needful orders—and, as he uttered the last words at the full pitch of his piercing voice, the trumpets rang a wild and thrilling flourish—the squadron, with a single shout, unbidden and unanimous, that spoke the burning feelings of the troopers, swept on at a hard trot; and, in an instant, not a sound was to be heard save the thick-beating clatter of the hoofs, mixed with the clang of spur and scabbard, and now and then a boom of the deep kettle-drum timing the pace of the advance. Onward! onward they hurried at the utmost speed which prudence would admit, which nothing but the admirable quality and high condition of their chargers enabled them to prosecute. Mile after mile was passed, and still the dull and awful roar—the knell of many a gallant spirit—waxed clearer and more clear. Having accomplished seven miles within the hour, they halted for ten minutes in a small hamlet to water and to breathe their horses; and there—when the confused and constant noise of their own rapid march was silent —they might distinguish the first sharp explosion of the leading gun in every rolling volley—and ever and anon, between the deep-mouthed cannon, the grinding rattle of the musketry was audible, though faintly. Onward! onward again, and, ere another hour elapsed, Ardenne had marked the clouds of smoke surging and eddying above the distant hills. The squadron cleared the verge of a low eminence; a gentle valley slept below them in the still misty radiance of a rich autumnal sunset; a tranquil stream wound through it, crossed by a lofty one-arched bridge—built, as was evident from the bright ripples of the ford beside it, merely for use in times of wintry flood—and to the left, at a short mile above the bridge, nestled the white washed cottages of a neat country village. The ridge which bounded this fair dale toward the west, though cultivated at the base, and checkered with dark woods and golden stubbles, lay bare toward the rounded summits in unenclosed and open sheep-walks. Above these summits the volumed smoke rose white as fleeces of the purest wool, and scarce less solid to the eye, relieving every object on the brow as plainly as though it had stood out against a clear horizon; while all the mingled din of battle rolled up, a near and fearful contrast to the sweet peace of that secluded spot. Just as they gained a fair view of the valley and the heights beyond, a single figure crossed the opposite swell, dark and distinctly seen; a horseman on a furious gallop! As he descended, a slant sunbeam glanced upon his iron headpiece—he was a trooper—flying! Another rushed across the ridge—another, and another—a confused and panic-stricken group. “Forward!— secure the passage of the stream! Forward! ho! forword!” and at a yet more rapid pace they plunged down the descent; they reached the causeway of the bridge—they lined the banks with their arquebusiers, and waited the arrival of the fugitives. On came the first, urging his jaded steed, but urging him in vain; his sword was gone—his holsters empty—his buff-coat soiled and splashed with many a miry stain. His spurs alone were bloody! Long ere he reached the bridge Ardenne's quick eye had caught the orange scarf, and he rode forth alone to meet him. At first the fugitive drew up his horse as though he would have turned, but a fresh roar of cannon from behind decided him. “All's lost! all's lost!” he cried— “all's lost! Fly! fly! Rupert is close behind!” “Silence, for shame!” shouted the partisan— “coward and slave, be silent, or I cleave thee to the earth! If all be lost, why rages you hot cannonade! How far from this to the field?” “A short three miles,” replied the other, trembling, and fearful no less of new acquaintance than of the foes he fled. Meanwhile on came the rest —all panic-stricken, travel-soiled, and weaponless; but not one man was wounded. “The cowards!” Edgar muttered, as if carelessly, when he rejoined his men, fearful lest they might be disheartened—“the vile, dastard hounds! that fled without blow stricken or blood drawn! But that 'twere loss of time, I would draw out a file for execution. We will advance, and win more casily, that none are left to cumber us with heartless counsels! Fly on, ye dogs,” he cried, more loudly, as he wheeled his men once more into their column—“fly on, and pray the while ye fly that ye meet not with Cromwell on your route, else shall ye but repent that the cavaliers made not an end of ye before your race began; for, an' I know him, he will cut it right short with a halter or a volley!” And, with a scornful laugh, he cantered on, eager to gain the vantage of the hill, and seeing at a glance that no more runaways poured over it. “It cannot be,” he said to his lieutenant—“it cannot be the day goes utterly against us, else how should these have fled three miles from the encounter, and still the firing on both sides continue—continue, said I—nay, but it waxes warmer!” They reached the summit of the ridge, and at first sight Edgar indeed believed that all was over-A long broad valley lay outstretched beneath him, that might almost be called a plain—the foreground scattered thick with groups of roundheads, flying —here singly, here in bodies—to the south, toward the town of Keinton, in a line nearly parallel to the range of heights on which he stood; while in the middle distance he might see a torrent of dispersed pursuing cavalry, with flaunting plumes and fluttering scarfs, swords brandished to the sun, and pistol-shots all redly flashing out through the dense smoke, as unrelentingly they urged the massacre. But, as he looked more steadfastly upon the scene, he could distinguish, at some two or three miles' distance toward the northern verge of the unbroken valley, two dark, uninterrupted lines, whence rose the smoke and burst the vivid flashes of artillery with undiminished vigour—he could discern, between the cloudy screens, the wavering and wheeling masses that still waged the balanced fight, and he could hear the rattling volleys of the musketry sharp and incessant. “'Tis but our cavalry,” he said—“'tis but our cavalry that fly, and their horse-general has lost a golden opportunity; had he but wheeled upon our flank when the dog-troopers fled, he might have gained the battle! But it is now too late, and, an' he look not out the sharper, we may yet give him a rebuff he dreams not of. Sound trumpets—ha! sound merrily a rally and a charge! Advance, brave hearts, we will redeem the day. For lo!” he added, with rare tact, as he perceived the royal horse relaxing their pursuit, and heard their bugles winding a recall—“for lo! they have perceived us, and retreat already!” And down the slope he moved in admirable order, interposing a small wood between his force and the retiring cavalry of the victorious royalists—whom, notwithstanding his most politic vaunt, he little wished at that time to encounter. Just ere he sank upon the level ground he carefully reviewed the scene before him, and was even more convinced than ever that the battle was indeed still undetermined—and, farther yet, that the royalist horse were at the last aware of their mistake in urging the pursuit too far; for he might see them straining every nerve now to repair their error, as they swept back toward the left-hand rear of the contending parties, leaving thereby the access to the right wing of Lord Essex, whom Ardenne justly deemed to lie between himself and the king's forces, easy and unobstructed. Instantly he perceived, and profited as instantly by this advantage; marching at a sharp trot across the field strewed with the mangled carcasses of those who, by their dastard flight, had lost the wretched lives they sacrificed their honour to preserve, and forfeited all claim to that precarious boon, a soldier's pity. Once on the level ground, he could discover nothing farther, and the suspense was fearful; and now the cannonading ceased—the musketry fell thicker and more constant—then that ceased likewise, and was followed by the faintly-heard hurrah of charging horse, and the wild chorus of a psalm. “The day is ours,” he shouted, as he recognised the sounds—“on! on! to share the glory!” Faster they hurried, and but little time elapsed ere he brought up his squadron, without the slightest opposition, or indeed notice, on the king's part, to the extreme right of the position occupied in the commencement of the action by the army of the parliament. The moment was indeed most critical, and Edgar could not but perceive, as, having left his squadron for the moment in command of his lieutenant, he rode up and reported to the general, that his arrival was deemed singularly opportune. Never, perhaps, had been a field more nearly lost—never a victory more madly cast away—never a battle poised more equally. The base desertion of Sir Faithful Fortescue, the terror-stricken flight of Waller's horse on the left wing before the fiery charge of Rupert, and the defeat of the right wing by Wilmot and Sir Arthur Aston, had left both flanks of the parlimentarians utterly naked and unguarded; so that a single charge by either of the royalist commanders upon the flank or rear which they had turned, must have annihilated all of their array which yet stood firm—the foot under the earl in person, and a reserve of horse under Sir William Balfour. But with that desperate and selfish fury which neutralized, in every instance, the effects of his undaunted valour, Rupert drove past the left, as Wilmot passed the right, of Essex, trampling and cutting down their unresisting countrymen for several miles' distance from the field, the former suffering his men to sack the town of Keinton, and to disperse among the baggage of the enemy; while his desertion had not only robbed the king of all his hopes of victory, but actually placed him in a more evil plight, and peril far more imminent, than had defeat the foe. For Balfour, with his squadron of reserve, seeing the plain entirely clear of horse, had charged the royal foot with such a steadiness of persevering courage, that he had cut the Earl of Lindsay's regiment to pieces, taking that nobleman, with his brave son Lord Willoughby, both desperately wounded, prisoners—winning the king's own standard—throwing the centre into perilous confusion —and hewing his way almost to the person of the monarch. Just at this moment, when a bold advance of his whole line must have completed the king's ruin, Lord Essex was compelled, by Rupert's reappearance on his left with his fast rallying cavalry—who, though in disarray, and tired both horse and man, were flushed with their success and high in spirit—to recall Balfour to make head against him; and that bold leader's trumpets were calling off his troopers from their half-achieved success when Ardenne reached the field, and was directed instantly to move his fresh men forward to protect the left wing of the infantry till Balfour should draw off and relieve him. His troops, though new to service, were admirably disciplined and full of daring confidence in their tried leader; and with such promptitude and regularity did they manœuvre and deploy in face of a superior body, that he almost regretted that there was no better opportunity to prove their mettle and to flesh their maiden swords. His duty quietly performed, and the reserve of Balfour being reformed in haste and fronting Rupert, he was commanded once again to occupy his first position on the right; and now instinctively he saw that either army might be deemed half conquered—that a single charge— nay, but a single demonstration—would suffice to win an absolute and undisputed victory. Each host was spiritless and disarrayed—the leaders on each side confused and doubtful—the troops exhausted, slack, and heartless. Vainly he prayed the general-in-chief to suffer him to risk his single regiment in but one charge on Rupert's half-collected squadrons; pointing out to him clearly, but without effect, the strong presumption that his fresh men and vigorous horses must sweep away, like dust, the cavaliers, worn out with the lassitude for ever consequent on over-fierce excitement, and troubled farther at finding themselves assailed from having of late been assailants—and the certainty that, if such should be the case, undoubted conquest must ensue. The earl was cold and dubious. Vol. I.—S “We may not hope,” he said—“we may not hope for victory to-night. It is a mercy from on high—I had right nearly said a miracle—that we stand here as now, at vantage, holding the better of a doubtful day! An hour ago methought that all was lost. Moreover, it has gone tenfold more fatally with them than us. We have lost privates —men neither high of heart nor strong of hand, much less of eminence or wisdom—they the first flowers of England. Oh! I could wellnigh weep, but that 'twere treason to our cause, for the pure blood that has been shed like water—Lindsay, and Aubigney, and Stewart, and Edmund Verney, the bravest and the best of the array, all lost—all lost in this accursed quarrel! Two more such fields as this were fatal to the king, while ten such would but leave us, at the worst, where now we are!” Slowly and unconvinced Edgar rode back to his command; and as he watched the movements of the enemy, now holding the precise position they had occupied three hours before, whatever doubt he might have entertained till then vanished at once— for he beheld the hapless Charles—armed as becomes a king to battle for his crown, all steel from spur to helinet, a mantle of black velvet, with the star and George of diamonds, floating above his armour—reining his snow-white charger gallantly among his wavering lines, beseeching them “once more,” with energetic gestures—“once more to charge the rebels!”—and he beheld the faint and false-hearted denial; for not by any prayer or promise could those to whom he spoke with words of fire be wrought upon a second time to dare the onset. Meanwhile the sun set gloomily in a dense bank of clouds—the night, “that common friend to wearied and dismantled armies,” sank darkly down upon the plain so thickly set with sights and sounds of agony and horror that it was but one mighty charnel-house; and the two hosts, each on the ground whereon they fought, slept anxious and uneasy on their arms—uncertain of their present safety, and unresolved of their proceedings for the morrow. CHAPTER II. “Behold! our swords are drawn! Not for the bubble fame—nor at thy call, Vaulting ambition, that would stride the neck Of prostrate kings, to mount, with foot profane, Thrones of usurped dominion—but for right! For freedom—for our country—for our God! And think ye they shall e'er go up again, Till that this solemn cause adjudged shall be, In high Heaven's sight, by death or victory?” The morning was yet gray and gloomy after a night of frost—felt the more bitterly by those who bivouacked upon the field, since there was neither tree, nor hedge, nor any other covert nigh to fence them from the piercing wind—when Ardenne started from the disturbed and unrefreshing slumbers which had crept upon him, beneath the partial shelter of an ammunition tumbrel overturned and broken, uproused by the loud trumpets of the powerful re-enforcement brought up before the promised hour by Cromwell, consisting of two thousand foot, Hampden's and Grantham's regiments, and his own ironsides, whose presence might, on the preceding day, have turned the doubtful scale, and ended, at a single stroke, the war unfortunately destined to no such speedy termination. It was a strange and melancholy, though exciting scene, that met his gaze as he arose; the dark skies scarcely dappled in the east by the first paly streaks of dawn—the faint stars waning one by one as the cold light increased—the black brows of the neighbouring hills cutting distinct and sharp against the wan horizon —the white and ghostly mist creeping in wreaths along their bases, and curtaining the plain with a dense veil, through which the watchfires of the royal host, at scantly a mile's distance, burnt with a dull and lurid redness, like to the glimmering of a witch's caldron—the foreground heaped with the carriages of the artillery, horses picquetted in their ranks, and companies of men outstretched on the dank soil, sleeping upon no better couches than their dripping cloaks, beneath no warmer canopy than the o'ercast and gusty firmament. Nor were the sounds that rose at intervals from the opposing camps, and the deserted battle field between them, less wild and mournful than the images which crowded their nocturnal area—the measured tramp of the unwearied sentinel, now mingled with the clash of armour, and close beside the ear, now gradually sinking into silence as he visited his farther beat—the clang and clatter of the horse patrol, sweeping at wider distances around the guarded limits, and the deep, melancholy cadence of his occasional “All's well”—the neigh and stamp of restless chargers—the howling of forsaken dogs—and, sadder and more terrible than all beside, the feeble wailing, the half-heard, distant groan, or the long-drawn, but unavailing cry for succour, of maimed and miserable wretches, battling and wrestling with their mortal pangs throughout the livelong night, and cursing the unnatural strength that nerved their fainting and reluctant flesh to strive with that inevitable angel, whom their more willing spirit would have welcomed as a rescuer and friend. While he was yet, with a sick heart and tortured ear, listening to these too numerous witnesses of human agony, and pondering upon the dread responsibility of him who, to indulge a lawless thirst after a little brief authority, had let loose on a happy land that most abhorred curse of nations, domestic war, an orderly rode up in haste to crave his presence at the quarters of the general. After a short and rapid walk toward the rear, he reached the spot where Essex, like the meanest of his men, had passed the night, beneath no other roof than the inclement sky. A dozen pikes, irregularly pitched into the ground, and draped with horse-blankets and watch-cloaks, offered a shelter rather nominal than real against the night air on the north and east, while a huge pile of logs sparkled and blazed in front, casting a wavering glare of crimson upon a group of tall and martial-looking officers, collected round the person of their leader, and glittering more obscurely on the arms and figures of a score or two of troopers, who sat motionless on their tall chargers at some short distance in the rear. The council, as it seemed to Edgar on his first approach, were absolutely silent; but, as he drew more near, he found that Essex was addressing them, although in tones so low and so subdued that they scarce reached the ears of those for whom they were intended. Nor, as he judged from the expression painted on every countenance—for the lord general ceased from speaking just as he joined the circle—were his words calculated to inspire his listeners with confidence or warlike spirit. A blank, desponding gloom sat darkling on the brows of all, and every eye save those of the new-comers, who stood together and apart a little from the rest, dwelt gloomily upon the ground. It seemed a S 2 meeting rather of defeated and despairing fugitives, than of the bold and dauntless spirits who had but yestereven maintained a more than equal strife against the flower of England's nobles—till, suddenly, with his harsh features kindling into passionate and fiery animation, and his eye glancing wildfire, Cromwell, whom Edgar had not hitherto observed, upstarted from a pile of housings and horse-furniture on which he had been seated—“As the Lord liveth,” he exclaimed—“as the Lord liveth, we can smite them hip and thigh, if so be that your excellency will give me but command to charge upon them now, while they yet lie, with faint hearts and with heavy eyes, about their watch-fires. I ask but for my own stout troop of ironsides and Master Ardenne's horse here, if he list to join me—I ask but these, and, verily, I do profess to you, they shall not bide the changing of a buffet; nay, but we may destroy them utterly, smiting them with the sword, as Joshua smote them beside the waters, even the waters of Merom, what time he did to them as the Lord bade him; he houghed their horses and burnt their chariots with fire!” “It is too late, sir!” returned Essex, coldly— “it is too late! The morning will have broken ere you can get your men to horse!” “Nay, but not so, lord general,” anxiously interrupted Cromwell; “my troopers be not yet dismounted; and, of a truth, I do assure you that their spirits are athirst, ay, and their souls an hungered, to do this battle for the Lord!” “We will not have it so, sir,” replied the earl, shortly, and scarcely courteously—“we will not have it so. It might endanger our whole host. I pray you, Colonel Cromwell, draw out your horse upon our farthest left, facing thereby Prince Rupert on the king's right wing. And you, fair gentlemen”—turning to Hampden and to Grantham— “move up your gallant foot to re-enforce our centre. Had ye been here but yesterday, I had not feared to gain a complete victory; but now I hold it rash to offer or commence, though, by God's help, we will not shun encounter. Sirs, to your posts. The council is at end. The day is breaking—lo, there sounds the reveillèe!” “Cold council!” muttered Cromwell in the ear of Ardenne, as he left the presence; “cold council, if not traitorous! and, at the best, false argument!—for an he could half beat Charles Stuart without us yesterday, sure, with three thousands of fresh men, and those the best of his array, he might now trample him beneath his feet! Besides, with Verney slain outright, and Lindsey captive, and half their officers cut down or grievously en treated, stands it not certain that they must need be faint of heart? Verily! verily! I say to you, there shall be no good thing befall the righteous cause while such a leader marshalls us.” As he concluded he turned off abruptly, mounted his horse, and rode away toward his troopers, who awaited their stout colonel in the rear; and, ere ten minutes had elapsed, Edgar might hear them chanting, in subdued and sullen tones, the melancholy psalm, “Save me, O God, for the waters are come in unto my soul,” as they marched gloomily away to occupy the post to which they were assigned. At the same time the regiments, which, for the last half hour, had been getting under arms, fell in, and faced the army of the king, now clearly to be seen, as the mists gradually rolled away before the growing daylight, resuming the position it had held before the action of the previous day. The instruments of music sounded, indeed, and cheerily, and the bright colours fluttered gayly in the freshening breeze; but other sign of spirit or alacrity along the serried ranks Edgar saw none before he reached his own brave troopers, already mounted and in accurate array, under Sir Edmund Winthrop, his lieutenant, and eager—as the heart-stirring shout with which they greeted their commander spoke them—for the onset, of which they deemed his presence the immediate harbinger. The sun rose broad and bright, kindling the whole expanse of heaven with his fair lustre; the mist-wreaths floated upward, and dispersed themselves into the delicate and scale-like clouds, flecking the azure skies, which promise glorious days; the morning gradually passed away, and noon drew nigh, and still each army held its ground, facing the other in the stern array of warfare, both, as it seemed, prepared and resolute to meet, but neither willing to commence, the onset. At times, the trumpets on one side would breathe forth a wild flourish of defiance, and a shout or psalm would go up to the peaceful heaven from the other, intended, it might be, to challenge or to irritate the foe into some movement that should lay him open to attack; but the sun now rode high in heaven, and hour by hour the chances of a general action became less imminent. Suddenly—at a moment when all those leaders of the parliament, who deemed it no less for their interest than honour to give battle, almost despaired of any opportunity for sealing their adherence to the cause—there was a movement on the right wing of the royal host. Directly in the centre of the field, midway between the lines of either army, four light field-pieces, sakers and culverins, had been abandoned, on the previous day, by the king's infantry, when shattered and disordered, though still fighting with their faces to the foe, by the repeated charge of Balfour's horse. So rapidly had night set in upon the wearied hosts, and perhaps so fearful were both parties of then doing aught which might provoke renewal of the conflict, that these, the proof and prizes of the victory, had been permitted to remain unmoved, either by rescuer or captor, through the long hours of darkness; and, until midday was at hand, no disposition was exhibited to bring them off, whether by cavalier or puritan. But now—either disposed to fight, if needful, with courage gathered from the weak policy of Essex, or convinced by their inactivity that he should meet with no resistance from the despised and hated roundheads—Rupert dashed forth in person from the right, with a detachment of the king's horseguard, that gallant troop of nobles whose impetuous and headlong daring, though at the first it had passed, like a torrent, sheer through the reeling ranks and weaker cavalry of its opponents, had yet done more against the final gaining of the day than had the fiercest struggles of the adversary. Forward they came, mounted on horses that might each have borne a king to battle, rending the air with their repeated cheers, and with the joyous clangour of their defying trumpets, a flood of waving plumes and fluttering scarfs—the bravest and the best-born of the land. Midway between the hosts they galloped on, exposing, as it would seem, in very wantonness of bold bravade, the flank of their advance to the stern ironsides of Cromwell, who showed like a dark storm-cloud ready to burst upon their heads with all the crash and ruin of a tempest. Already were those gloomy martialists exchanging their dull scowls of rigid and abstracted sanctity for the fierce flashings of enthusiastic joy, with which they never failed to clothe their features when rushing down like eagles to the banquet of the sword! Already were they brandishing their heavy blades aloft in savage exultation. Already were they lifting up their voices in the triumphant psalm which should preface their thundering charge, and, rising high above the din of battle, strike terror and confusion to the hearts of those whom, as they sung, “The Lord—even the Lord of Hosts—shall hunt, to overthrow them!” But, ere the word was given by their colonel, whose sword was in his hand outstretched toward the flaunting cavaliers, on whose destruction he securely counted, an officer came, at the full speed of his spur-galled and foaming charger, bearing the mandates of the general. “Ha! Major Winton,” Cromwell exclaimed, with a raised voice and joyous intonation, “you bring us right glad tidings—tidings which my soul comprehendeth ere mine ear hath caught their import. Tarry thou but a little space, and call me coward then, an thou see them not performed unto the letter—ay! and those gay malignants yonder scattered like chaff before the wind of heaven! Sound trumpets, and—” “Hold! Colonel Cromwell; in the Lord's name, hold!” the other interrupted him, with a half frightened energy of zeal; “you do misapprehend! 'Tis the lord general's command that you stir not a foot! He would avoid an action.” “Tush, man, it cannot be!” Oliver fiercely cried; “nay, stay me not!—forego thy grasp upon my rein! Let me not now, I say, or truly I will—” “Nay, sir,” returned the officer, cutting again into his speech, as much chagrined by the impetuous gesture and half uttered threat, “you shall do as you list for me; but I do warn you, 'tis against express commandment of my Lord of Essex if you shall charge these horse. See how they muster yonder to the front of the main host, dragoons and cavalry, for the support of this detachment. One charge must need bring on a general action.” “The better!” answered Cromwell, with a gloomy frown; “the better—an we had aught of faith in the good cause, or spirit in our carnal calling. But on his own head be it! Surely the Lord hath deadened his understanding, causing his heart to fail with terror and with fainting! On his own head be it!” and, as he spoke, he sheathed his rapier, driving it home so furiously that the hilt rang against the iron scabbard with a sharp, angry clatter; “on his own head be the shame, the ruin, and confusion!” and, turning his charger's rein, he rode away toward the rear, in a dark, sullen revery, determined not to look upon the capture of the guns since he could not prevent it. Nor did he check in anywise, or reprimand the deep and bitter murmurs of reviling which the fierce zealots he commanded launched against the cold and cautious policy that thus forbid them “to arise, and slay the enemy at Karkar, even as Gideon arose when he slew Zebah and Zalmunnah!” And, in the sight of the whole host, the chivalry of Rupert dashed along, with brandished weapons and bright banners, unharmed at least, if not unheeded. They pounced upon the cannon, and not a sword was drawn or a shot fired. Six powerful horses, led for the purpose, and already harnessed, were, on the instant, linked to every gun; and away they went, bounding and clattering over the frozen soil at a hard gallop, while the fearless cavaliers formed front toward the host of Essex to cover their retreat, patiently waiting till they reached the royal lines. Then, with three regular cheers of triumph and derision, they filed off at a foot's pace, as if unwilling to return without exchanging shot of carbine or stroke of sword, even although victorious. Another hour elapsed, and yet another, and still the armies held their stations steadily, face to face, neither advancing to attack, neither disposed to quit the field in presence of the other. Noon was already past, when a fresh movement was observed among the royalists near to the centre of the army. But this time, as it seemed, no hostile measures were intended; for a white flag was suddenly advanced beyond the outposts of the army, and then, preceded by his trumpet, and followed by a glittering train of pursuivants, attired in their quartered tabards, Clarencieux, king-at-arms, refulgent in the blazoned pomp of heraldry, caracoled forth upon a snow-white palfrey, whose embroidered housings literally swept the ground. When it had almost reached the advanced guards of the parliament, the gay procession halted, while its trumpets stirred the echoes of the slumbering hills with a long-flourished blast, calling the leaders of the host to a pacific parle. But, be their errand what it might, their summons called forth no emotion from the stern puritans. No officer rode down to meet them—no peaceful symbol corresponding to their own was raised to greet them—no trumpet answered theirs, though thrice it brayed aloud, with notes of evident impatience. Wearied, at length, by the contemptuous silence which alone answered to his overtures, leaving his train where it had halted, the king-at-arms rode slowly, with a dubious air, as if but ill assured of safety, toward the nearest guard of horsemen, one pursuivant alone attending, and demanded to be led forthwith to the lord general; after brief ceremonial, the subaltern, detaching half a dozen men, escorted him along the line, requiring him emphatically, and with a glance toward the carbines of the guard, which rested upon their thighs, in readiness for instant service, to speak no word an he would reach the general in life. Nor was his greeting much more cordial when, after hurrying him, with small respect, along the serried ranks, the subaltern resigned him to an officer of Essex's lifeguard, who, with the same stern discipline, conducted him toward the quarters of the brave though over-cautious nobleman who held the chief command. The general was mounted on his charger, with his leading-staff in hand, attired in a suit of beautiful half armour, with a broad scarf of orange crossing his cuirass, and a feather of the like colour drooping from his morion. The Earl of Bedford and Sir William Balfour were beside him, likewise on horseback; and some half dozen of his staff, with Colonels Hazlerig and Hampden, stood around, dismounted. Essex, with whom he had no personal acquaintance, looked full upon him without a word or sign of salutation; but Balfour, whom he knew, bowed slightly. “I bear, so please you, my good Lord of Essex,” the king-at-arms began, in nowise daunted by his cold reception, “I bear a gracious proclamation of his majesty, Charles, by the grace of God—” “Hold, sir,” cried Essex, in a sharp and angry tone, “hold, sir—to whom bear you this message? Speak out, sir—and fall back, you loitering knaves! back with you all! back out of earshot!” as he perceived the troopers of his body-guard crowding a little forward, as if to mark what passed. “Charles, by the grace of God—” continued the bold speaker, resuming, even where he had been before cut short, the thread of his discourse. “To whom—to whom, I say, bear you this message?” exclaimed Essex, in tones of fierce excitement, the blood rushing in crimson to his brow. “To whom, save me, dare you bear any word?” Vol I—T “To all,” he answered, calmly—“to all men present here bear I his majesty's most merciful—” “Silence, audacious!” thundered the general; “silence, if thou beest not aweary of thy life! Knowest thou not, William le Neve, knowest thou not that for this breach of every law of war and nations I might cause thee hang?—hang like a dog upon the nearest tree, for all thy painted mummery! Away with him, sir,” he continued, after a short pause, as if ashamed of his display of violence, addressing the officer who had escorted him, “away with him!—see him a hundred yards beyond our outposts; and if he do but breathe too loudly, shoot him upon the instant. I do profess,” he added, turning again to the abashed and silent messenger, “I do profess to you, you have incurred a very fearful risk; but, that you may not lack an answer, say to your master that we have drawn our swords at bidding of the parliament, and in behalf of those ancestral liberties, which we will either transmit free and unfettered to our children, or lose together with our lives!—thou hast thine answer.” And with even more precaution than he had been admitted was he led back to join his followers by a stout squadron of the general's lifeguard, who, halting at some twenty yards from the confused and trembling pursuivants, deliberately blew their matches and levelled their short arquebuses! Startled at this manœuvre, it needed little, when the officer informed them, “That, an they were not a full flight-shot on their route before three minutes, he should fire a volley on them,” to send them at a furious gallop scattering towards the king's array. This was the last attempt; and, ere an hour had elapsed, the guns and carriages of the king's host were drawn off by the road to Edgecot, his late quarters; and Essex, on beholding their retreat, was no less willing to lead away toward Warwick his wearied and disheartened army, abandoning thereby to Charles the access to the capital—which he had marched, and even risked a battle, to defend—whenever he should choose to profit by the errors of his enemy. Scarce had the orders for this movement been delivered before a trooper galloped up to Ardenne's post, gave him a packet, and, without waiting a reply, dashed spurs into his horse, and was already out of sight ere Edgar had discerned its purport. It was a mandate from the general in council, directing him to join his force to that of Colonel Cromwell, and place himself at once at his disposal; and he had hardly read it through when Oliver himself rode up. “You have received,” he said—“you have received already, as I see, those tidings which, trusting that they may not be displeasing, and that so you be not rendered an unwilling instrument in this great cause, I have come hither to communicate. I am detached forthwith to march with mine own ironsides and with your gallant horse for Cambridge—thence to protect the safety of the eastern counties—and verily I do rejoice, for my soul sickeneth at coward councils; and, so long as we tarry here, we be not like, I trow, to meet with brave ones! Come with me, Edgar Ardenne, and I tell thee that we can achieve great things for the deliverance of this groaning land—yea! and work more for its regeneration, with our poor hundreds and the Lord's hand, which of a very deed shall smite on our side—frail vessels though we be and faithless—more to advance the liberties of England, than Essex with his tens of thousands!” CHAPTER III. “Not for my life! not though the hosts of heaven Bend down their knees in suppliance at my feet, And woo me to consent, shall one poor coin Defile my palm of what is his by right— His heritage—bequeathed i' the olden time From honoured sire to son, and last to him, Most honoured, who should heir it now, as free As his great soul—and shall, by Heaven, for me!” It was a sharp clear evening, some two months later than the undecided action of Edgehill, while both the armies were lying in their winter quarters —that of the king at Oxford, whither he had immediately retired after his treacherous violation of the truce at Brentford, and consequent repulse from London; that of the parliament in the metropolis and its vicinity—when a small group, composed of individuals the most discordant both in character and outward show, was gathered in the oriel parlour of the old manor-house of Woodleigh, affording to the eye a combination singular and picturesque. Sir Henry Ardenne stood in the centre at the oaken table, on which a standish was displayed of massy silver, with implements for writing, and a long scroll of parchment, carefully engrossed, and decked with several broad seals, to which, as it would seem, he was preparing to affix his signature. His figure, still erect and stately, was clad in a rich military suit of buff, splendidly laced with gold, booted, and spurred, and girt with the long rapier of the day; his snow-white locks hung down on either cheek, uncovered, for an attendant held in readiness for instant use his high-crowned beaver, with its drooping feather, and his sad-coloured riding cloak. His noble features were knit firmly with an evident expression of resolve, although a teardrop might be seen to twinkle in his dark eye as he looked down upon his niece, grovelling in the dust before him, prostrate, and clinging to his knees, with her rich hair in its dishevelled volumes half covering her lovely form—with her hands clasped, her eyes uplifted to his face, her lips apart but motionless, in agony of tearless supplication. A hoary-headed servant watched, at an easy distance, the development of the sad scene, with every wrinkled feature telling of his affectionate concern; while a stout, stolid-looking yeoman, summoned, it might be, to attest a signature, lounged at his elbow, staring in rude indifference on the display of passions with which his boorish nature vainly sought to sympathize; a small man, meanly clad in a black buckram doublet, with an inkhorn and a penknife in lieu of weapons at his girdle, of an expression impudently sly and knavish, was the last person of the group within the manor; but without, plainly to be discovered from the casements, there was assembled a fair company of horsemen, gayly equipped in the bright fluttering garb affected by the cavaliers, with the old banner of the house of Ardenne unfurled and streaming to the wintry wind, and a groom leading to and fro the favourite charger of the head of that high name. “No! no!” cried Sibyl, in tones that quivered with excitement till they were barely audible, resisting the slight force which the old man put forth to raise her—“no! no! I will not rise. Here! here at your feet will I remain till I prevail in my entreaty! Oh, you were wont to be wise, generous, and just! Temperate in your youth, as I have heard them tell, and calm—be then yourself, T 2 my noble uncle, be then once more yourself, nor sully, by this deed of unconsidered rashness, a whole long life of wisdom and of honour.” “It may not be,” he answered, quietly, though not without an effort, as he compelled her to arise —“it may not be. The time allotted to our race hath now run out!—the house of Ardenne is extinct with the old miserable man who stands before you!—the lands that have been subject to my name for centuries shall never know it more! The Lord gave—the Lord hath taken away—blessed be the name of the Lord! But would—oh, would to Heaven that his corpse had mouldered on some foreign battle-field—that his bones had been entombed deep in the caverns of the sea—that he had died by any death, how terrible soever—that he had dragged out any life, however wretched and intolerable! Better, far better had it been so to have mourned for him, than to have seen him thus —a blot—a single blot!—on an unblemished name! a traitor to his king—a foeman to his country—a curse to him from whom he drew his being! No! plead to me no more; for never, never shall a traitor—a fanatic and hypocrite traitor—inherit aught from me save the high name he hath disgraced. I have—and I bless Heaven that I have it—through his own act of treason, the right to sunder this entail, and sundered shall it be ere sunset! He hath no corner of my heart—no jot of mine affections; himself he hath cut out his path, and—rue it as he may—by that path must he travel now unto the end —dishonoured—outcast—disinherited—accur—” “Oh, no, no, no!” she shrieked, in frantic tones, drowning his utterance of a word so terrible when coming from a parent's lips; “curse him not!— curse him not! or never shall you taste of peace again. Father, curse not your son—you firstborn, and your only! Sinner, curse not your fellow! Christian, curse not a soul, whose hopes are thy hopes also! Curse not, but pray!—pray—not for your erring child—but for your rash and sinful self! Pray, uncle, pray for penitence and pardon!” Affected somewhat by her words, but yet more by the fearful energy of her demeanour than by the tenour of her speech, Sir Henry paused—but not to doubt, much less to bend from his revengeful policy. “In so far, at the least, fair niece—in so far, at the least,” he said, with a smile evidently forced and painful, “you have the right of it. 'Tis neither Christianlike to curse, nor manly. But to this gear, good Master Sexby,” he continued, turning to the lawyer, who had gazed with hardened coldness on the affecting scene; “this deed, you tell me, is complete and firm in all the technicalities?” “As strong as law can render it, Sir Henry,” returned the mean attorney, “else know I nothing of mine own profession. Since Master Ardenne, being last of the entail, and now declared a traitor by proclamation of his majesty at Oxford, could scarce inherit, even without this deed of settlement on Mistress Sibyl and her heirs—” “Never!” she answered, in a calm, low voice, the more peculiar from its contrast to the fiery vehemence she had before displayed; “never would I receive the smallest share, the least particular of that which is another's—that other Edgar Ardenne, too!—though I should perish of starvation —never! And heirs—what tell ye me of heirs? Think ye that I—I, the affianced bride of such a man—would deign to cast myself away on his inferior? No, no! your testament is nothing worth. Heirless will I die, or die the wife of Ardenne! What, then, avail your crafts and subtleties of law? I spurn their false and fickle toils before me, as the free hawk would rive asunder with his unfettered wing the trammels of the spider's web!” “Peace! for your fame's sake, peace! degenerate girl,” the old man sternly answered; “would you disclose to these your miserable weakness—” “To these? To every dweller of the universal earth would I avow the strength—the constancy— the immortality of my legitimate and hallowed love! Affianced in my youth, by thee affianced, to one whom both my reason and my heart prefer, why should I shrink to own it! Weakness?—I tell you, uncle, that I am no whit less strong—nay, ten times stronger than yourself—in faith, in loyalty, in conscience, in resolve. If I may not approve his actions—and of a truth I do not—I may not but revere his motives! and if those actions must half sever the strong links that join us, and render me for very conscience' sake a widowed maiden, his motives, pure, and sincere, and fervent as an angel's faith, shall at the least forbid me to misjudge, much more to wrong him. Weakness? —I tell you I adore him—adore him even more for this his constancy to what he deems the better cause, when every fibre of his heart is tugging him to the other—when loss of name, and fame, and fortune must be the guerdon of his unflinching and severe devotion to a mistaken creed! Yet, deeply, singly as I love him, never will I wed Edgar Ardenne while he unsheaths a rebel blade or prompts a rebel council. I tell you I adore him, yet will I die a maiden! unless—” and she paused, for a space, in her most eloquent appeal, as if to mark what influence it might have had upon the mind of her stern relative—“unless, by this your madness, you drive me to do that my conscience shrinks from. Suffer your broad lands to descend to him who justly heirs them, and rest assured that sooner will I die than marry with a rebel! Leave them to me —as in the madness of your passion you propose —leave them to me, and instantly will I make restitution to the rightful owner, if by no other means, at least by sacrifice of mine own conscience— mine own person!” “Go to!—you will not, Sibyl!” exclaimed the old man, vehemently; “I know you better than you know yourself—you would not do so, were things a thousand times more precious than these miserable lands dependant on your action!” “And wherefore not?” she cried; “have I not, at the dictates of my conscience, cast from me the affections of the warmest and the highest heart that ever beat for woman? Have I not sacrificed unto my sense of loyalty—a sense, perchance, fantastic or mistaken—my every hope of happiness on earth? And wherefore shall I not obey the voice of the same counsellor, and to a sacrifice less grievous? Think you the love of a justice is a less eloquent or weaker advocate than the mere love of kings? But, since you may not be convinced by argument, nor won by any pleading, hear me then swear, and hear me Thou,” she added, solemnly turning upward her bright eyes, flashing with strong excitement, and dilated far beyond their wonted size— “that sittest on the wings of cherubim—Thou that hast no regard for kings, nor any trust in princes, receive my vow!” She paused an instant as if to recollect her energies, and as she paused a deep voice broke the silence— “Swear not, my gentle cousin,” said the slow, harmonious voice; “and, above all, swear not for me!” Instantly every eye was turned in the direction whence sounded those unusual accents; and in the sight of all, upon the threshold of the open door, there stood a tall and stately figure, wrapped in a horseman's cloak of some dark colour, and wearing a slouched hat and falling plume, which veiled effectually, in that dim, uncertain light, the features of the speaker; but their concealment mattered not, for every heart at once, and, as it were, instinctively, knew Edgar Ardenne, whose arrival, with the slight bustle that accompanied it, had passed unnoticed during the all-engrossing interest of the scene in which those present were engaged. “Swear not in my behalf, dear Sibyl,” he continued, doffing his high-crowned beaver, and displaying his fine lineaments, haggard and pale from violent emotion, “nor, if you love me, thwart my father's will. In good time, I perceive, have I come hither, since something of your purpose reached my ears ere you beheld my presence—” “And wherefore,” his father fiercely interrupted him, laying his hand upon his rapier's hilt— “wherefore have you presumed, traitor and villain, thus to defile these honourable halls with the pollution of your footstep? Have you come sword in hand, leading your canting and psalm-singing hypocrites, to spoil, and slay, and lead into captivity? or have you come, forsooth, with oily words and a God-fearing countenance, to preach to the old man the error of his ways, that he too may unsheath the sword of Gideon, and go down with the chosen of the Lord to strive against the Philistines in Gilgal! Such is the style of your new comrades, and thou canst mouth it with the best of them, I warrant me! Canst thou not preach and pray? canst thou not quote the Scriptures of the Lord to justify the doings of the devil?” “For none of these things have I come, my father,” he replied, in sad and humble tones, sinking upon his knee, “nor yet for anything that may offend or grieve you. Hear me, I do beseech you;” for, by the angry gesture of Sir Henry, he perceived that his speech was like to be cut short —“hear me but for a short while, and I will cease to pain you with my presence.” “Be it, then, for a short while,” answered the other, nothing mollified by the calm patience of his son, “if be it must at all—as I suppose it must, for I can well believe that you have some five hundred fighting men of the saints to back you, else had you never ventured hither. Let it be for a short while, sirrah, for even now I look to see the roof-tree of my father's house topple and crush the wretch that has brought infamy on all it shelters!” “Not a soldier—not a follower—not a groom,” said Edgar, sorrowfully rising—“though I look not that you will credit me, is with me, nor yet within ten miles of Woodleigh. Alone I have come hither, once more to say adieu, and crave— what I have nothing done to forfeit—a father's blessing!” “'Tis well,” Sir Henry interrupted him in a cold strain of the most cutting irony ere he had fully ended, “excellent well, indeed! So get you on with what you have to say, as I in turn will presently do somewhat. Anthony, get you hence and fetch us lights; it hath grown dark betimes; and you, good Master Hughson,” he continued, turning toward the yeoman, “will wait our leisure in the buttery. Now!—get you on, son Edgar.” “I did hope,” sadly replied the partisan, “that your resentment, sir, had in so far abated that you might have endured without disgust my passing visit. To offer you the reasons for my conduct were, in your present mood, I fear, of no avail: suffice it, therefore, to inform you that, though I may lose much, I can gain nothing by the part I have espoused—that neither power, nor place, nor bribe of woman's love, nor proffered rank, nor yet the baser meed of gold, hath tempted me—that neither gift nor guerdon will recompense my service, nor aught else save the inward quiet of an innocent heart, and the most high approval of Him who can alone interpret it. But of this enough. This deed, if I mistake not, which now but waits your signature, is destined to deprive me of my heritage. My father, as the last save me in the entail, and I proclaimed a traitor,” he continued, turning toward the lawyer, “hath, as you deem it, the power to alienate this property. Hold! interrupt me not; it may be that he hath—provided always that the party which proclaimed me traitor shall come off victorious in the end, and masters! If not, your deed is nothing. But think not”—and he turned again toward his father—“think not, I do beseech you, sir, that I would for one moment condescend so to inherit what you would not that I should possess. Annul this futile deed, and I, the last in tail, will join with you to sever that entail for ever! Let this man execute the papers, and, whensoever needed, my signature shall be forthcoming! So, whether king or commons win the day, shall you be sole disposer of your broad possessions. The son whom you abhor would freely barter all for one short word of kindness—for one last blessing from a father, at whose command how gladly would he sacrifice all save his conscience and his honour!” “I take you at your proffer,” rejoined the baronet, without one symptom of relenting in his hard eye —without one sign of soft or kind emotion at the devoted generosity of his discarded son; “base knaves although they be with whom you have descended to consort, I can rejoice you have not lost all your nobility of soul. I take you at your proffer. Affix your signature and seal to this blank parchment—for it may well be we shall never meet again—and here I pledge to you my knightly word of honour that it shall be applied as you have said, and to no other end.” A large tear stood on either cheek of Edgar as, with a steady hand, and firm though darkened countenance, he signed his name in bold, free characters, and so surrendered for himself and for his heirs the title to that noble patrimony which for so many ages had been graced by the high virtues of his ancestry. But the tear flowed not, nor was the brow o'ercast for any selfish thought—by any sorrow for the wealth thus forfeited—by any fond regret for the old home of happier days thus lost for ever. At other times such feelings would have, perhaps, been busy at his heart—would have, perhaps, excluded every other sentiment; but now it was the coldness of the father's tone, the stern and firm resolve of hatred which had possessed the father's heart, that clouded the broad forehead of the son and dimmed his eye. Quietly he replaced the pen upon the standish, and once more sinking on his knee, “Father,” he said, in faltering and husky tones, “I never yet, save in this one respect, have disobeyed or grieved you; your blessing, oh my father!” “My blessing to a rebel—to a hypocrite—a traitor!—not though my life should pay for my refusal!” thundered the pitiless old cavalier. “Be grateful that I curse you not—be grateful, not to me, but to yon pale and suffering angel, whom your false villany hath blighted, for she alone with-holds it. Begone!—why tarry you? Begone, and Vol. I.—U never let me look upon you more! Begone, an outcast from my heart for ever!” For a minute's space he stood, fixed as the eldest-born of Niobe, pierced by the arrow of the vengeful god—pale, motionless, and voiceless!— the wretched girl had sunk, at the last fearful words, mercifully deprived, for a short space, of sentiment and reason; his father stood between them, with flashing eyes and arms extended, as if he wanted but a pretext to launch upon his head the awful terrors of a paternal curse. It was but for a minute that he stood doubtful and unresolved; his pulse beat hurriedly, his sinews quivered, his lip paled with anguish—yet in one little minute was the paroxysm ended. “Bless you, my father, bless you!” he exclaimed, in piteous and heartrending tones; “may the great Ruler of the universe protect and bless you! Oh, may you never know the anguish you have this day heaped, fiercer than the coals of fire, on the heart of a despairing child! Farewell—farewell!” He turned, and, ere a word could be pronounced —a motion made to intercept him, vanished into the darkness of the hall. Then, and not till then, did the hot anger of the old man's heart relent; “Edgar,” he gasped, in faint and faltering tones, “my boy—my boy!” but so low was the intonation of his voice that it reached not the ears of him who would have welcomed those half-uttered words even as a voice from heaven. The aged servant, who had watched the scene in silent agony, sprang forth as to recall him—but again it was too late! The angry clatter of his horse's hoofs upon the pavement of the court alone announced the keenness of the goad that rankled in the bosom of the rider; and ere an effort could be made to overtake his flight, the demon pride had once more gained ascendency, and with a darker frown and colder accents than before, Sir Henry now forbade all further care—consigned his hapless niece to her attendants—gave brief directions to the lawyer for the fulfilment of his cruel policy—mounted his horse, and rode away, self-satisfied and stern, through the chill darkness of the wintry night, to join the king at Oxford ere he should raise the standard for his second sad campaign. CHAPTER IV. “Flourish'd the trumpets fierce, and now Fired was each eye and flush'd each brow. On either side loud clamours ring— `God and the cause'—`God and the king'— Right English all, they rush'd to blows With naught to win and all to lose. I could have laugh'd—but lack'd the time— To see, in phrenesy sublime, How the fierce zealots fought and bled For king or state, as humour led.” Scott's Rokeby. The winter had already passed away, and with it every hope of present reconciliation between the monarch and his parliament. Early in March the royal hosts were in the field, one in the western counties, commanded by the king in person, and the most dashing of his generals, impetuous Rupert—another in the north, under the gallant Newcastle, the noblest gentleman and most accomplished soldier who fought beneath the banners of his sovereign. During the first months of the year the tide of fortune had flowed constantly in favour of the cavaliers. In March, a desperate action, fought upon Hopton Heath, near Stafford, had made small compensation to the parliament, by the death of brave Northampton, for the defeat of Gell and Brereton. Rupert had taken Cirencester, treating his captives with unmanly and relentless cruelty; and, shortly afterward, in the same sort had captured and half burnt the flourishing and wealthy town of Birmingham. Nor had the occupation of Reading by the Earl of Essex brought anything except disaster and disease upon its captors. A dangerous conspiracy had broken out among the puritans, and, though suppressed and punished by the deaths of the two Hothams, Challoner, and Tompkins, had yet led many to believe that seeds of discord were already sown among the democratic party, which would ere long destroy their unanimity for ever. A heavier and more fatal loss befell—not his own party merely, but the whole realm of England, in the untimely death of Hampden, mortally wounded in a trivial skirmish upon Chalgrove field in Buckingham; he died, as he had lived, a patriot—a martyr to the cause of freedom—his last breath, ere he rendered up his spirit to his Maker, expended in a prayer for his oppressed and bleeding country. Nor had the partisans of liberty fared much more hopefully in the North; Sir Thomas Fairfax, after a short but unsuccessful stand against the Marquis of Newcastle on Atherton Moor, was compelled to retreat before his victors, who pressed on with much energy and vigour to recover Gainsborough, which had been stormed and garrisoned by the Lord Willoughby upon the parliament's behalf. In this important aim they scarcely could have failed, had not the leader of the ironsides with his brave cavalry, augmented in their numbers to full two thousand men by Ardenne's junction—having already greatly signalized himself by the defeat of a superior force of royalists before the walls of Grantham, and by the storm of Burleigh house and Stamford—gallantly interposed between the town and Newcastle's advance. The enemy, amounting to above three times his number, under Lieutenant-general Cavendish, the brother of the marquis, flushed with their late success—composed of picked men for the most, and officered by gentlemen of equal gallantry and rank — and animated by the highest spirit of loyal bravery — had occupied a station so commanding that they could only be assailed by passing through a gateway, and charging up a steep acclivity. Yet not for this did Cromwell hesitate an instant; but, personally leading on his troopers, he resolutely rushed upon them, and, after a brisk conflict, routed them utterly, forcing them from their position into a deep morass, and killing Cavendish, with most of their superior officers. Burning for vengeance, the main body of the royalists, neglecting Gainsborough, pushed on, and with such overwhelming numbers that Cromwell was compelled to fall back first on Lincoln, and thence immediately on Boston, uniting there his forces with the army of the Earl of Manchester, whom he had been appointed with all speed to re-enforce, as second in command to that stanch nobleman. Upon this point Newcastle marched, eager for battle, and desirous to engage, before the host of Manchester should be increased by new accessions, which, as he learned, were swelling day by day his ranks; having detached Sir John Henderson, an old and well-proved soldier, in advance, with eighty-seven troops, horse and dragoons, to seek out Cromwell, and bring him, ere the earl could aid him with his infantry, to action at a disadvantage. It was a glorious morning in the latter part of U 2 June, and at an hour so early that the heavy dews of summer were yet hanging unexhaled on wold and woodland, although the sun had lifted his broad disk above the horizon, when the two armies came in view on Winsley field, near Horncastle. It was a gallant and a graceful spectacle as ever met the eye of man. The scene a broad and waving tract of moorish meadow land, checkered with many a patch of feathery coppice—birch, ash, and alder—tufts of furze full of its golden bloom, and waving fern—and here and there a bare gray rock peering above the soil, or a clear pool of water reflecting the white clouds that hung aloft all motionless in the blue firmament—and over this romantic champaign a magnificent array of horse, four thousand at the least in numbers, contracting or extending their bright squadrons, now falling into column and now deploying into line, as best they might among the obstacles of this their battle-ground — their polished armour and their many-coloured scarfs now flashing out superbly as the sunshine kissed their masses with its golden light, now sobered into mellower hues as some great cloud would flit across the sky and cast its sweeping shadow over them—their trumpets ever and anon waking the echoes of the woodlands that surrounded them on every side with their exulting notes, and their gay standards fluttering in the breeze—their gallant chargers, arching their necks against the curb, bounding and curvetting along as if they panted for the onset—while toward the eastern limits of the plain, upon a gentle elevation, flanked on the one side by the gully of a deep and stony brook, and on the other by a coppice, tangled with ancient thorns, and matted with wild rose briers, which protected likewise the whole rear of his position, Cromwell had formed his line. Nor, though inferior far in numbers, and lacking all that chivalrous and splendid decoration which their floating plumes and gorgeous dresses lent to the cavaliers, could his dark squadrons have been looked upon without attention—ay, and admiration also, by the most unromantic of observers. The admirable discipline and perfect armature of the stern zealots who composed the ranks—the plain, but soldierly and bright accoutrements—the horses, superior even to the chargers of the royalists in blood, and bone, and beauty, and, above all, in that precise and jealous grooming, without which all the rest are little worth—the grim and stubborn countenances of the riders—some animated with a fiery zeal that would have smiled exultingly upon the stake of martyrdom, some lowering with a dark and sullen scowl, but all severe, and resolute, and dauntless! A single glance sufficed to tell that every battle-field to them must be a triumph or a grave! Silent they stood and motionless—their long array drawn up, two deep, by squadrons at brief intervals—solemn and voiceless, presenting a strange contrast to the shifting movements and the intricate manœuvres of their approaching enemy. Not a man moved in his saddle, not a sound broke the quiet of their discipline, save now and then the stamp and neigh of an unruly charger, or the sharp clatter of his steel caparison. And now the cavaliers, within a short mile's distance, having already cleared the broken ground, might be seen halting on the farther verge of the smooth space which swept away toward them in a gentle slope, unmarred by bush, or brake, or obstacle of any kind to the career of the most timid rider; when, with some three or four of his most trusty captains, Cromwell advanced before his lines. Of stout, ungainly stature when dismounted, none showed to more advantage on his warhorse, and in full caparison of battle, than did the colonel of the ironsides. It was not that his seat was graceful, or that he ruled his charger with the ease of the man êge, but that he swayed him with an absolute dominion, which seemed to arise rather from his mere volition than from the exercise of strength or skill. His whole soul seemed engrossed by the approaching conflict—careless of self, exalted, and enthusiastical. His eyes flashed with a brightness almost supernatural from the dark shadow of his morion, and his whole visage wore an aspect so irradiate with energy and mind, that Edgar wondered how he ever could have deemed him ill-favoured or ungraceful. His horse, a superb black, bore him as if he too were conscious of Divine authority; and such was the commanding greatness of his whole appearance, that no human eye could have descended to remark the plainness of his war-array! Of the small group of officers who rode beside the bridle of their leader, the most were ordinary looking men, burghers of Huntingdon, or small esquires of the surrounding country, selected for the stations which they occupied, by the wise politician who had levied them, on account of those morose and gloomy tenets which, with an early prescience, he discovered to be the only power that might cope with the high spirit of the gentlemen who formed the bulk of their antagonists—men who affected, or imagined visions and transports— who believed themselves predestined instruments, and deemed that in the slaying of malignants they were doing an especial service to the God whose chosen servants they declared themselves, with a faith in the truth of the assertion which rendered them almost invincible. Among these plain and heavy-looking soldiers, the form of Ardenne, highborn, and full of the intuitive and untaught grace of noble blood, gallantly armed and handsomely attired—for he was not one of those who fancied that the approbation of Heaven could be won by a rusty corslet or an ill-blacked boot—mounted on a dark chestnut, thoroughbred, yet powerful enough to bear a man-at-arms fully accoutred through the longest day, showed like a glorious falcon among a tribe of buzzards; yet even he, handsome, and young, and fairly clad, filled not the eye like the majestic person of his colonel. At a quick trot they swept along the lines, inspecting their array, with now a word of commendation, and now a short reproof, to the dark fanatics who had been chosen lance-pesades or sergeants for their savage and enthusiastic humour. Just as they finished their career, a long and cheery shout, accompanied and blended with the clang of kettle-drums and the shrill flourish of their trumpets, burst from the columns of the cavaliers, now wheeling into line and eager for the onset. No shout or burst of instruments replied from the parliamentarians; but their leader, at the sound, checking his charger from his speed till he reared bolt upright, threw forth his arm with a proud gesture of defiance; “Brethren,” he called aloud, in accents harsh but clearly audible, and thrilling to the heart—“Brethren and fellow-soldiers in the Lord, the men of Belial are before you—the persecutors of the saints—the spillers of the innocent blood—godless and desperate!—slayers of babes and sucklings—ravishers of maids and matrons— revilers of the prophets and the law—accursed of the Lord Jehovah! Wherefore, faint not, nor be of feeble heart, for surely on this day shall the Lord yield them up into your hands, that ye may work his vengeance on their heads, and execute his judgments. For said he not of old, `Lo! I will tread them in my anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. For the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come!' So saith the Lord of Hosts. Amen! amen! Selah!” And, with a deep and sullen hum, the puritans took up the words—“So saith the Lord of Hosts. Amen! amen! Selah!” “And are not we,” continued the fierce zealot, with increasing energy—“and are not we—blinded although we be, and ignorant and sinful—I ask ye, brethren, are not we the chosen of the Lord, and shall we not obey his bidding? Smite them, then —smite the idolatrous, besotted followers of the old Antichrist, even as just Elijah slew the priests of Baal down at the brook of Kishon. Be strong, and fear ye not! For lo! the Lord hath said, `Ye shall not suffer one of them to live!' and who are we that we should now gainsay the bidding of the Lord, even the Lord of Hosts? Lift up your voices, then, that yon malignants may perceive in whom we put our trust.” Again, and in a sterner and more heartfelt shout, the approbation of the puritans greeted their leader's ears; and as he ceased, with brandished blades and inflamed features, and with voices that drowned utterly the feebler music of the cavaliers, already confident of victory and maddened with religious zeal, they thundered forth their favourite hymn. “What saith the God of battles, the mighty Lord of Hosts? Ye shall prevail against them, though loud their godless boasts! Ye shall destroy them utterly, and root them from the land, For I will give ye strength, and edge your battle brand! “`At the rebuke of one shall mighty thousands fly, For I have heard my people's prayer, their sad and grievous cry! And I will raise my glorious voice, that it be heard afar, And show the lightning of my hand—my right hand—in the war. “`Wo unto them that put their trust in the Egyptian's crown— His chariots and his horsemen—his power and his renown!— The Egyptian he is man—not God—in whom they put their trust; His horses are not spirit—but frail and fleeting dust! “`When I stretch out my hand, together they shall fall, The helper and the holpen—yea! they shall perish all! Of old ordain'd was Tophet; for the king it was made hot, As thorns that in the furnace blaze, or briers beneath the pot! “`But ye—ye are my people—the ransom'd of my soul! Glory shall be your heritage, Jerusalem your goal! And the sceptre shall not leave ye, and the crown shall not depart From the faithful house of Judah—from the chosen of my heart!”' The fierce strains ceased, and a loud acclamation followed them, solemnly breathing a sublime, yet savage spirit of defiance, and was responded to immediately by the huzzahs of the advancing cavaliers, and the rich symphonies of horn and kettledrum. A small reserve of some five hundred men was posted in the rear, and, in one mighty line, the rest swept forward at a brisk trot, the front rank with their carbines all unslung and matches lighted. Cromwell gazed steadfastly upon them for an instant—then his eye lightened and his lip curled scornfully as he addressed his second in command. “Lieutenant-colonel Ardenne,” he exclaimed, “dismount two hundred of our best dragooners, and, under Fight-the-good-fight Egerton, let them file down that gulley to our left, and fire constantly on the advance of these misproud malignants.” Without a moment's pause the order was transmitted and obeyed, and, ere five minutes had elapsed, the party was detached and scrambling down the rocky bed of the ravine, unnoted by the royalists, under the guidance of as morose and bold a puritan as ever levelled musket or misquoted holy writ. “Sir Edmund Winthrop,” Oliver continued, “your stout lieutenant, shall hold your regiment, as our reserve, here on this ground of vantage—but shall not stir from it unless at your command or mine. We will not tarry for their charge, but meet them horse to horse—in onset of alternate squadrons. I lead the first division, you shall support me with the second. When you shall hear my bugle sound a recall and rally, then strike in, and the Lord strike with you. `Truth' is our word and `Peace.' Amen! Selah!” Even as he spoke, the royalists gave fire from their first rank, but at too great a distance to do execution, and halted to reload. “Steady, men!” shouted Cromwell, whose sword was not yet drawn, from the extreme left, as he perceived a demonstration of anxiety to charge among his troopers— “steady, men; let them come nigher, and when they fire again, shoot also ye, upon their flash, through your whole line; and instantly, alternate squadrons from the left, charge on them ere they may reload!” Scarce had he ended ere the line again advanced on a hard trot; a single shot rang from the gulley, broken and fringed with thorns and alder-bushes— another, and another—a rapid and continuous fire of skirmishers, picking off half a score of officers, and throwing the right wing of the royalists into some slight confusion; on, however, they still came, their banners rustling, and their gay plumes and baldrics fluttering in the wind, while, trusting to make such impression on the main host of the puritans as should cause their ambuscade to be of no effect, they hurried to the onset. On they came, resolute and dauntless! Their bugle sounded, for the gallop —for the charge! and, at the latter call, again the levelled carbines rose to the riders' cheeks—a bright flash ran along their line, and a dense veil of smoke covered their orderly and brilliant front. Before it cleared away, the shattering volley of the puritans, poured in with a deliberate aim, made fearful havoc in their ranks, and on the instant, casting aside their matchlocks and whirling their long rapiers from the scabbards, one half the squadrons of the parliament hurled themselves furiously upon the advancing foe. Eagerly, anxiously did Edgar gaze upon the charge. On went the colonel of the ironsides, six horses' lengths in front of his division, and all as gallantly out dashed a leader of the king's to meet him—they met, and it was but an instant ere the charger of the royalist ran masterless, and its unhappy owner rolled, weltering in his blood, beneath the trampling hoofs of the fierce puritans. There was no faltering—no doubt in either line—forward they rushed, all straining to the charge, their horses foaming and struggling against the bit, and their swords flashing in the sunlight. Edgar unsheathed his rapier, for now a horse's length scarce intervened; yet neither host had paused or turned aside. And now they were encountering, when the rear rank of the cavaliers threw in with desperate execution their reserved volley, shaking the line of the parliamentarians like an earthquake, emptying scores of saddles, and hurling riders and horses headlong to the earth. The smoky curtain once again swept over them; it cleared away, and Ardenne saw his fellow-troopers, unbroken and in close array, so orderly had they closed in above the falling, now mingled hand to hand, and fighting with the cavaliers, whose front was bending like a bow—the points, on which the troops of Oliver had charged, beat backward a full pistol-shot, and the alternate squadrons which had met no foe wavering and undecided what to do. Sword cuts were glancing through the air on helm and corslet—pistol-shots flashed among the melèe; and the shouts, “God and the church”— Vol. I.—X “God and the king,” blended with groans, and yells, and curses, and the clash of blades, and the wild blast of trumpets, pealed dissonantly to the sky. Still Cromwell's bugle sounded not, nor were his men drawn off; and Ardenne paused in doubt. His eye fell suddenly upon the form of Oliver fighting among the foremost; another volley from a small knot of cavaliers, and he fell—horse and man—and the strife closed more fiercely round him; at the same instant the reserve of Henderson moved up to re-enforce his battle. Then Edgar paused no longer—“Forward!” he shouted, in a voice of thunder—“forward—charge home!” and dashing down the grassy slope, before a minute passed burst like a thunderbolt upon the unengaged divisions of the enemy, and, killing two men with his own hand, drove them in terrible confusion, by the fury of his onset, back on their own reserve. Turning his eye, now he had gained a moment's leisure, toward the spot where he had seen his colonel fall, he caught a glimpse of him on foot, fighting with desperate courage against some six or seven horsemen, who were hewing at him all together with their long broadswords, and hindering each other by their own impetuosity. Three strokes of his good sword, and the superb exertions of his charger, placed him at Cromwell's side just as he fell to the earth, stunned but unwounded by a heavy blow. One of the cavaliers received the point of Edgar's rapier in his throat before he checked his horse; the others were engaged and beaten backward by the foremost of his troopers. Hastily springing to the ground as Oliver regained his feet, “Mount,” he exclaimed, “mount, Colonel Cromwell, on my horse, and finish what so well you have begun!” Without a word the zealot leaped to the saddle, cast his eyes with a quick comprehensive glance around him, and read the fortunes of the day upon the instant. “They are half beaten now,” he shouted, in exulting tones; “one charge more, and we sweep them like dust before the winds of heaven! Away, sir—down with the reserve, and fall upon their left flank. I will draw off my men, and, ere you be in action, will be prepared to give it them again in front. Ho! bugler,” he continued, as Ardenne, mounting his brown mare, which his equerry had led up, galloped off swiftly to the rear—“ho! bugler, sound me a recall and rally!” The shrill notes of the instrument rang aloud above the din of battle; and with that strict obedience for which they had already gained repute, the ironsides drew off from the encounter orderly, and beautifully formed again, before the shattered and disordered masses of the cavaliers had fallen into any semblance of array. In the mean time Ardenne had reached his regiment, the men burning to emulate the glory half achieved by their companions, the horses pawing the turf, and snorting with impatience. A loud shout greeted him as he addressed them, in a few words terse and full of fire, formed them by troops in open column, and advanced between the coppice on his right and the extreme left of the enemy, now near a quarter of a mile pushed forward beyond their right and centre, which had been most disordered by the fire of the skirmishers and Cromwell's furious charge. So great, indeed, was the confusion of the royalists, their officers toiling along the ranks, labouring with oaths, and menaces, and exhortations to rally and reform the men, that they perceived not Ardenne's movement till he was wheeling into line to the left previous to charging them. Then, when it was too late, they struggled to redeem their error nobly but fruitlessly; for, ere they could show front against him, the trumpets sounded—Oliver's in front, and Edgar's on the flank—and simultaneously they were charged, broken, and dispersed. The action was already over—but the rout, the flight, the havoc, the despair, the hideous, indiscriminating massacre, urged to the utmost by religious fury and political rancour, ceased not till noon; when Cromwell's bugles, slowly and most reluctantly obeyed, called back the men, their weapons blunted and their arms aweary, but their hearts insatiate of carnage, from the hard-pressed pursuit. CHAPTER V. “Upon the bloody field The eddying tides of conflict wheel'd Ambiguous, till that heart of flame, Hot Rupert, on our squadrons came, Hurling against our spears a line Of gallants fiery as their wine; Then ours, though stubborn in their zeal, In zeal's despite began to reel.” Brave Cromwell turn'd the doubtful tide, And conquest bless'd the rightful side. Scott's Rokeby. Though but of brief duration and trifling magnitude as to the number of the troops engaged on either hand, yet was the victory of Cromwell upon Winsley field of vast importance, when considered in its bearings on the general aspect of the war; since by it only was the Marquis of Newcastle prevented from co-operating with the royal forces in the West, when, elevated as they were in spirit by the defeat of Waller upon Roundway Down, and the disgraceful fall of Bristol, they might too probably have marched triumphantly to the metropolis, had they been re-enforced, as they expected, by the northern chivalry. In consequence of this repulse, then, Newcastle sat down before the walls of Hull, while Charles, thus disappointed in his schemes, as fatally laid siege to Gloucester, which he was soon compelled to raise by the activity of Essex. The desperate drawn battle before Newbury ensued, signal for nothing but the death of the good Falkland, the only counsellor that now remained about the king who could be deemed a patriot or a true lover of the English constitution. The Hampden of the royalists, this gallant nobleman fell with his country's name the last sound on his lips; but fell not till he had become aweary of a life which was imbittered so by the disasters of his native land, that he was wont to sink, even when circled by the gayest of his friends, into desponding apathy, and “to ingeminate, after deep silence and continual sighs, with a shrill sad accent, the words `Peace—peace!”' The winter which succeeded was by the cavaliers spun out in feuds, dissensions, and intrigues among themselves, the king remaining obstinately bent on prostrating all opposition to his will, and countenancing such alone of his advisers as urged the fiercest and most downright measures. Not so the parliament at Westminster, in which the independent party were, by the death of Hampden first, and afterward of Pym, gaining an ascendency which was increasing daily through the abilities of Cromwell, St. John, and the younger Vane, the leading politicians and debaters of the lower house. The energy and deep-laid shrewdness of these men suffered not one false step, however trivial, on the part of Charles, to pass unnoted or unimproved to their advantage; and, ere the spring was far enough advanced for the commencement of a third campaign, they had so thoroughly aroused the spirit of the land, inflamed already by the king's impolitic and shameful treaty with the rebellious Catholics of Ireland, that, early in the month of March, five several armies were on foot! Essex preparing to oppose the king in person—Waller commanding in the West—the Scotch, who had invaded England in accordance with the solemn league and covenant, and Fairfax, with his Yorkshire levies, shutting up Newcastle in York—and Manchester, with Cromwell's cavalry, hurrying from the associated counties of the East toward the same important point. And now, for the first time since the commencement of the war, did fortune show herself in favour of the liberal party; the total and complete annihilation of Lord Hopton's force at Alresford by Waller, was in itself sufficient to compel even Charles to give up all attempt at a campaign on the offensive. Nor was this all; for Newcastle's express advised him that he must surrender unless succoured in the brief space of three weeks. It was on this intelligence that Rupert, having achieved much reputation and some eminent successes in that large county, marched out of Lancashire with all the flower of the royalists—drawn from the midland counties, burning with gallant ardour, confident in their successful leader, appointed with a noble train of ordnance, and re-enforced by Goring's excellent brigade of horse from Lincolnshire—hastening ably, and no less fortunately, to the relief of York, reduced already to extremity, and on the point of yielding to the parliament. During the dark and melancholy winter which had thus elapsed, Ardenne, in close attendance on his duties, whether civil in the house at Westminster, or active in the field, had struggled, with more of steadiness than of success, to banish from his heart the recollection of his own depressed and wellnigh hopeless circumstances. Of his implacable and stubborn father he had heard but little since their last interview at Woodleigh, save that a copy of the document for the securing the estates to Sibyl and breaking the entail had been transmitted to him for inspection; and that a rumour, as it proved well founded, had reached London that the old baronet, having been strenuous and incessant in stimulating warlike measures, had left Oxford in the dead of winter, dismantled his fine residence, and thrown himself, together with his niece, into the capital of Yorkshire, some short time only ere it was invested by the united troops of Fairfax and the Earl of Leven. Such was the state of matters when, on a lovely evening of July, some few days after the strong succours under Manchester and Cromwell had joined the northern army, Edgar returned from a reconnaissance which he had been sent, in consequence of rumours that the cavaliers had been observed in force toward the neighbouring towns of Wetherby and Bramham, to execute, with his whole regiment, in that direction. During the two days which had been consumed in scouring thoroughly that district of the country, he had discovered nothing to justify, in any sort, the vague reports which had prevailed ere his departure from the camp; and it was therefore much to his amazement that he perceived the forces of the parliament drawing off from the siege in no small hurry and confusion, and forming line of battle upon Marston Moor, some eight miles to the westward of the city. It was not without strenuous exertion that Ardenne found at length the post assigned to his immediate superior, now lieutenant-general of the horse, who was intently occupied with Leslie, Fairfax, Manchester, and others of the chief commanders, in ordering their array so as to intercept the gallant host of royalists, some twenty thousand strong, with which Prince Rupert had wellnigh surprised them in their trenches. Night fell upon them ere the task was well completed; yet such was the determination and the spirit of the leaders, such the quick apprehension and obedience of the soldiery, that, by the aid of torches and the long summer twilight, their position was made good; and that, too, on the strongest ground that could be chosen from the extensive, low, and somewhat marshy meadows lying between the Ouse and the great Northern road. Provisions were served out, with liquor, in abundance to the troops, who, for the most part, passed the night upon their arms, though some were quartered in the neighbouring villages, commanding the anticipated line of Rupert's march. Patrols of horse and foot swept the surrounding roads; the officers, with jealous zeal, made constant circuits of the host, their progress being clearly indicated by the acclamations of the men, and the loud psalms of exultation and defiance which usually answered their inspiriting addresses. Yet was their active energy on this occasion destined to be wasted; for scarcely was their host arrayed, ere the discharge of ordnance from the town, and the tremendous cheering, which was distinctly borne to the ears of the now disappointed puritans, announced that Rupert—who, by the aid of better information and the exertion of great military skill, had executed a detour far to the right of their position—was actually entering the beleaguered city from the eastward side, whence they had drawn their troops in the vain hope to intercept him. Great was the consternation and dismay which this discovery created in the breast, not of the privates only, but of the best and boldest leaders of the parliament; and in no less degree did merriment and wild triumphant revelry possess the citizens, relieved beyond their utmost expectation. Throughout the livelong night the eastern sky was reddened, wellnigh to the zenith, by the crimson glare of bonfires blazing in every street and court within the walls; while the square towers of the minster, illuminated by the fierce discoloured light, were visible distinctly at some miles' distance, their huge bells swinging to and fro, a deafening peal of shortlived exultation. Upon the moor a council was called instantly, and sentries posted round the quarters of the Scottish general, with the avowed intention of maintaining an inviolable secrecy concerning the debates of the stern martialists assembled there. Such was, however, the tumultuous and noisy character of the discussion between the English officers and the fanatical enthusiastic Presbyterian clergy, whom the Scotch brought habitually into their warlike councils, that no precaution could have hindered the entire army from perceiving that dissensions, fired by their religious differences, and fed to wilder heat by prejudice and national disgusts, had fallen, with a perilous and most pernicious influence, upon their leaders. It was now nearly dawn, when, breaking up their long-protracted session, they at length came forth. Despondency and gloom sat heavy on the resolute and manly brow of Fairfax as he strode forth and leaped into his saddle, without altering his garb, though in immediate prospect of a general action. He was not, indeed, utterly unarmed, for he had entered the court-martial with but brief time for ceremony, after toiling from the preceding day-break at the evacuation of the trenches; yet did he lack much of the heavy armature which was still worn by officers in high command. A buff coat, richly laced with silver, its open sleeves displaying the white satin of its lining; stout breeches of the same material, fringed at the knee with costly Flanders lace; and boots of russet leather, formed the chief part of his defensive dress, although he wore a short but highly polished breastplate, half covered by his falling collar from the looms of Valenciennes, and by the sash of crimson silk and gold which was wound many times about his waist, supporting his long silver-hilted broadsword. He bore his truncheon in his hand, and, ere he mounted, buckled on his head the open bacinet of steel peculier to the day, which an attendant held in readiness. Upon the faces of the other generals anger, irresolution, and disgust were variously but strongly written; and in the features of the Scottish tords especially, Ardenne imagined he could trace a settled disaffection for the service they had bound themselves to execute. No time was lost, however, and, by a series of manœuvres, not less judiciously than rapidly effected, the whole position of the army was reformed and taken up anew; so that its front, which had originally faced toward the west, as to oppose an enemy advancing against York from that direction, was now turned easterly, in readiness to meet the sally, which they hoped, rather than expected, to be made on them from that same city. Sir Thomas Fairfax, with his new-levied Yorkshire cavalry and three Scotch regiments of horse, held the extreme right wing, and next to him the infantry of his brave father, with two brigades of Scottish horse in readiness for his support. In the main body and reserve were all the regiments of Scottish foot, appointed well and officered by their own covenanting lords, and two of Manchester's brigades; while the left wing was occupied by Cromwell, with all his iron cavalry, and three good regiments of Northern cuirassiers under Lieutenant-general Leslie, and Colonel Frizell's regiment of Berwickshire dragoons, who did good service in the action, posted yet farther to the left, by a cross ditch intersecting the main dike, which ran along the whole front of the puritans, excepting a brief space before the Earl of Manchester's pike-regiments. The plain, upon the western side of which the army was drawn up, was, on the whole, well suited for a general action, being of considerable extent, entirely open, and untraversed by any hedge or fence save on the left, where a long narrow lane between high banks and bushes of old thorn debouched upon the field, forming the only pass by which Fairfax could cross the drain and bring his horsemen into action. The rear of the parliamentarians was covered by the thickly-planted orchards, each with its quickset fence, the narrow garths and gardens surrounded by stout walls of limestone, and the young plantations round the straggling village of Long Marston; which, with its solid cottages of masonry, would form an excellent and easily-defended point whereon to fall back if repulsed from their original position; while on both wings the strong enclosures of the pasture fields, studded with hedgerow timber, would present most serious obstacles to any movement of the enemy to overflank them. Of all the generals, it seemed to Edgar that Cromwell was the least disturbed in mind or aspect; yet even he, as he addressed his ironsides, spoke not with the short, terse, and energetic style which he was wont to use when he chose to be understood, but in interminable and confused harangues, resembling more the doctrinal discourses of a fanatical and visionary preacher than the heart-stirring oratory of a dauntless captain; nor did he hesitate to declare openly to Ardenne, when at a little distance from the troopers, that—“Of a truth, there is sore need of prayer and supplication— not of lip-service or knee-bending—but of soul-searching cries, of earnest and continual wrestling with the Lord; for verily, unless he work great things this day in Israel's behalf, verily, Edgar Ardenne, you shall behold this host melting away like now before the April sunshine. Unless the God, even the God of Battles—harden the hearts and blind the understanding of yon perverse and fiery Rupert, even as of yore he hardened the heart of Pharaoh, that he might bring him to destruction, with his captains, and his chariots, and his horsemen—unless he do all this, and more, I tell thee, we shall fall into the pit ourselves have digged! If the prince have but wisdom to abide in yon fenced city which he has won from us, then shall you see the carnal-minded and the feeble-witted of the host—those who, like babes and sucklings, may not endure the rich meats and strong waters of the Word—those who are ill-assured, self-seekers, and backsliders—then shall you see all these, and they outnumber half our army, falling away by tens, by hundreds, and by thousands! But lo!” he added, in a quick, clear voice, strangely at variance with the drawling snuffle he had thus far adopted, “whom have we here? Tidings, I trow, from my lord general;” for, as he spoke, a youthful officer dashed at a hasty gallop up to his side, and checking, for a moment's space, his fiery horse, “The earl,” he cried, “lieutenant-general, prays you will hold yourself in readiness for instant action! Rupert and Newcastle are even now without the gates, and marching hitherward to fight us!” “Said I not,” shouted Oliver, so loudly that every one of his own cavalry might catch the import of his words—“said I not that the Lord would harden the heart of our foe and blind his understanding? The Lord he is on our side; blessed be the name of the Lord!” and instantly he raised, with his own tongue, the first notes of a hymn, in which he was accompanied at once by full five thousand deep and manly voices. “Not unto us—not unto us be given The glory and the praise— Nor to the mortal sword— Though shrewdly we have striven Long nights and bloody days— But unto thee, O Lord!” The fierce sounds rolled along the front, from corps to corps, till one half of the host had kindled with the same enthusiastic confidence and swelled the same high chorus! It was one of those bright flashes of that brightest talent in a leader, the talent of inspiring trust, of awakening energy and zeal, of lighting into sudden flame the hearts of thousands by a single word—a talent, by-the-way, in which no captain ever has excelled, and probably but two[2] [2] Mohammed and Napoleon. have ever in the least degree approached the wondrous man who was that very day about to make himself a reputation with the mightiest. As the thunders of that glorious psalm rolled onward, gaining strength at every pause, and echoing for miles around, doubt and despondency passed instantly away—pulses, that but an hour before had throbbed with cold and feeble beatings, now leaped exultingly—eyes, that had rested sullenly Vol. I.—Y upon the earth, flashed cheerfully and vividly to the new-risen sun—and tongues, that had half uttered words of evil omen, and almost of fear, now swelled the warlike anthem to the skies. Before the psalm had yet well ceased, and while its echoes were still alive and ringing in the air, the pikeheads of the royal foot might be seen twinkling in the level sunbeams above the coppices and furze-brakes that fringed the east side of the plain. And now a massive column burst into open view, their bright steel sallets and their coats of plate reflecting in broad sheets the light, which flashed in long and dazzling streaks from their tall weapons as they wheeled up into line —and now a strong brigade of field artillery, its caissons and its tumbrils following, came rumbling up at a full trot—and now, with many a blazoned standard streaming, and a white sea of plumes floating above them, squadron after squadron of that superb and highborn cavalry, to which the king owed all his previous victories, rounded a distant wood, and formed in accurate array upon the royal left. Then, as these formed, the heads of column after column debouched upon the plain, their mounted leaders darting along their flanks and fronts, their music sounding joyously, and the thick trampling of their march shaking the very ground beneath them—as these fell in, another train of field-pieces and a yet more magnificent array of horse wheeled up at the full gallop, and fronted Cromwell's ironsides at a mile's distance on the open plain. By seven of the clock both armies were in full array of battle, facing each other, when a gallant group of mounted officers advanced a little from the centre of the cavaliers, and instantly, amid the blare of trumpets and the exulting shouts “God save the king” of the brave gentlemen who mustered under it, the royal standard, with its gorgeous quarterings, was displayed to the light breeze, which bore its folds to their full length, and shook them toward the squadrons of its unrelenting foes. At the same moment, from the midst of the dark masses of the puritans, coldly arrayed in buff and plain gray steel, with neither scarf, nor plume, nor lace of silver or of gold to break the dull monotony of their appearance, was hoisted the blue banner of the covenant, bearing St. George's cross of red, but not yet intersected by the white diagonals of Scotland's patron saint. The elevation of this broad dark-coloured sheet was greeted by a stern and solemn acclamation, as different from the wild and animated clamour of the cavaliers as is the deep incessant booming of the ocean-surf from the sharp keen explosions of a thunder-storm. Then followed a short pause—a fel and appalling interval of quiet, like the brief space that often intervenes between the mustering of the storm-clouds and the outbreaking of the hurricane. The faces of the bravest paled, and their pulses beat with a quickened and irregular motion, not from the slightest touch of fear, but from the intense violence of their excitement. Prayers were recited in this interval at the head of every regiment among the parliamentarians, and many of the officers—and not a few even of the private troopers—men whom the spirit of the Lord had blessed with the high gift of expounding mysteries—held forth in their wild jargon, savouring to the ears of Edgar rather of blasphemous and profane phrensy than of devotion or well-ordered piety. It was at this conjuncture—just as Cromwell had concluded a long and fervent prayer, tinctured at times with true heartfelt religion, bursting occasionally into gleams of real eloquence, and throughout fixing the attention of the zealots, who applauded him from time to time with voice and gesture—that the same group of officers which had displayed the royal standard galloped in full career along the whole front of the cavaliers midway between the armies. The leading officer, as Edgar gazed upon him through his perspective-glass, was a tall, strongly-built, and splendidly-accoutred man, superbly mounted on a jet-black barb of the tall breed of Dongola—his cuirass literally blazed with stars and decorations of a dozen military orders; his mantle of dark purple velvet, fringed and laid down with lace of gold three inches broad, displayed the diamond insignia of the garter, and his high-crowned Spanish hat was overshadowed by an ostrich plume nearly two feet in height. Yet were his features coarse and ill-favoured, marked with a supercilious sneer, and an expression ill-humoured, haughty, and imperious; his hair, which flowed far down his shoulders, was harsh and quite uncurled; his figure, too, though tall and powerful, was graceless; his body corpulent and gross, betraying symptoms of debauchery and license, as plainly as his countenance reflected a mind despotic, brutal, and self-willed. The most profound respect attended his swift passage through the lines, and ever and anon some change of station or some delicate manœuvre was executed on his bidding; but, when he reached the extreme right of the royalists, he paused some time in deep and earnest contemplation of the post occupied by Cromwell with his cavalry, which were even then engaged in chanting one of their vengeful and prophetic hymns. Then sending off a dozen officers on the full spur in different directions, he cantered coolly forward with but two attendants, and these private troopers, till he was distant scarce three musket shots from the grim ironsides. Here he again drew in his horse, leaped to the ground, and, levelling his glass upon the pommel of his demipique, swept the array of Oliver with careful scrutiny. Edward had from the first concluded that this leader was no other than the impetuous and daring Rupert; had he, however, doubted it, the bitter imprecations and fierce shouts of the excited puritans, to whom his cruelty and his successes had rendered him an object of especial hatred, must have at once convinced him. But he had little time for observation; for Rupert, in his audacious reconnaissance, had, as it seemed, miscalculated his own distance from Frizell's Scotch dragoons, or overlooked the ditch that ran obliquely from their station to a point within a few yards of the elevation he had chosen, as commanding much of the parliament's position—an oversight which escaped not that experienced officer. A dozen of his men, as the prince halted, had dismounted from their horses, and, with their arquebuses ready and their matches lighted, stole on from bush to bush, behind the bank, unseen and unsuspected by the engrossed and anxious leader, till within short carbine distance—then, flash after flash, their scattering fire burst from the willow-bushes and the tufts of flags that lined the water-course—and, ere the sharp reports had reached the ears of Ardenne, one of the prince's followers leaped up in his saddle, and fell dead at his general's feet, while the perspective-glass dashed from his fingers, and the white plume severed by another bullet, showed how well-aimed and narrowly-escaped had been the volley destined for Rupert's person. The charger of the fallen trooper dashed masterless across the field, followed Y 2 with nearly equal speed by the surviving soldier, who halted not till he had reached his comrades— but he whose life was aimed at more peculiarly did not so much as look toward the enemy, whose fire had so nigh slain him, till he had raised his follower from the bloody sod, and ascertained that aid was useless. Then, quietly remounting, he shook his clinched hand in the air at the dragoons, who had reloaded and were now in open view preparing for a second shot, and trotted leisurely away toward his chosen horsemen. Scarce had this passed ere Edgar's notice was attracted by the raised voice of Cromwell, on whom he had been hitherto in close attendance, but who had ridden a short space to the left to give some orders to the colonel of one of his own regiments. His words were lost to Ardenne from the distance; but, by the short stern intonation of his accents, he knew that something was amiss, and galloped up to him at once. The officer whom Cromwell had addressed was sitting motionless before his regiment, his bridle loose upon his charger's neck, his open hands raised upward, his dull and heavy features lighted up by a phrensied glare, and his voice rolling forth sentence after sentence of unconnected texts, strung, as it were, together by a running commentary of his own ill-digested ravings. “Heard you me not? Ho! Colonel Obadiah Jepherson,” shouted the general close in his ears, his features kindling and his voice quivering with rage, “heard you me not command you straightway to despatch troops to bring up the fascines, that, when we list advance, we may have wherewithal to cross the ditch! Heard you not, or do you dare to disobey me?” “Must I not, then,” replied the other, in a drawling tone, “as Balak said to Balaam, `must I not take heed to speak that which the Lord hath put into my mouth?' ” and, turning toward the troops, he again went on—“Wherefore be ye as those, O brethren, whom the Lord set apart to Gideon—” But not for many words did he continue his oration; for, plunging both his spurs up to the rowel-heads into his mighty charger, and plucking forth a pistol from his holster, Oliver dashed against him. Leaving the rein at liberty, by the mere pressure of his limbs he wheeled the horse, as he was on the point of riding down his disobedient officer, and, seizing with his left hand the collar of his buff coat, with the right he pressed the muzzle of his weapon to his temples; and with such violence that, when the pistol was withdrawn, a livid ring remained on the indented and discoloured flesh. “Now, by the Lord that liveth,” he hissed between his set teeth, but in a whisper so emphatic and distinct that all around him heard it—“if you but wink an eyelid, much more speak, or move to disobey me, it were better for thee thou hadst ne'er been born! Away! and do my bidding, dog, or you shall die the death”—and, as he spoke, he shook him off so suddenly that he had wellnigh lost his saddle as he turned hastily away to set about his duty with as much alacrity as though he did so of his own free will. At the same time a loud sharp roar told that the action had commenced; and, riding once more to his station, Edward beheld a snow-white cloud surge slowly up toward the royal left—a bright flash followed— another burst of dense and solid smoke—another sharp explosion—and then, each after each, they woke the cannon of the cavaliers, till their whole front was veiled in wreathed smoke, drifting toward the parliament's array, and filling all the intermediate space as with a palpable and massive substance—while the continuous and deafening roar precluded for a while the possibility of hearing, and almost of thought. Anon the answering ordnance of the puritans belched forth its flame and smoke, and added its din to the awful uproar. At times, when the clouds melted for a moment under the freshening breeze, Edgar and his yet more observant leader might catch glances of the royal pikemen pouring in solid columns to the charge, the long lines of their levelled weapons glittering through the smoke—or, farther to their right, the masses of their horse, wheeling like flights of seabirds to and fro—now all in gorgeous sunshine, and now all in gloom. Meanwhile the rattling of the musketry was mingled with the deeper bellowing of cannon; and, among all and over all, the thundering accents of that most potent of all vocal instruments, the voice of man, pealed upward to the polluted heavens. A long half hour elapsed, and they might hear the battle raging at every instant fiercer toward their right, yet they remained still unengaged themselves, and without tidings or directions how to act. “By Heaven,” cried Ardenne, as he caught the distant glitter of the royal standard floating among the smoke almost within the puritan position—“by Heaven, our right must be repulsed;” and, as he spoke, an aid-de-camp dashed in, wounded and ghostly, from the right; and, as he reined his charger up, the gallant brute fell lifeless under him. “Fairfax is beaten back, and all our right wing scattered,” he exclaimed as he arose. “Silence, man,” Cromwell sternly interrupted him. “Wouldst thou dismay all these? Say on— but here apart, and not above your breath, an you would live to speak it out! Say on!” “Fairfax is beaten utterly, and all the right wing broken—you may not find two score of it together. As he charged through you accursed lane, the musketry of Belial mowed his ranks like grass before the scythe—and lo! the sons of Zeruïah—” “Tush! tell me not of Belial and of Zeruïah! or, by the life of the Eternal, I will smite thee with my truncheon! Speak out in plain blunt English,” again interrupted Oliver. “Fairfax was broken— and what then?” “His Yorkshire levies, flying all disorderly,” replied the officer, confused and panting still from the effects of his late fall, “trampled beneath their feet and utterly dispersed Lord Ferdinando's foot; Balgony's lancers only broke one royal regiment, and stout Sir Thomas, with but six troops of all our northern horse, has cut his passage through the cavaliers. These are now struggling hitherward—the rest are routed past redemption! Lucas, and Porter, and the malignant Goring are playing havoc on the flank of our best Scottish foot, and Newcastle, with all his whitecoats, is winning way in front at the pike's point.” “What message from the general? Quick, sir,” cried Cromwell—“quick!” “That you draw out with all despatch, and charge Prince Rupert!” “Why said you not so sooner?” Oliver replied. “Thou, Righteous Lambert, ride to Jepherson; bid him advance with the fascines and fill you ditch! Hulton and Barnaby, off with you to the first and second regiments; we will advance and cross the drain at a brisk trot, and—Ha! their ordnance ceases on the left; Rupert will meet us straightway! Forward!—advance! Ardenne, be near me thou! Forward! Sound trumpets;” and at a quick trot they advanced, but in the deepest silence, save for the clashing of their armour and the earth-shaking clatter of their hoofs. “Ha!” Oliver exclaimed again, as a quick spattering volley on their left was heard distinctly, though the smoke-wreaths were too closely packed to suffer objects to be seen above a spear's length distant—“there goes the musketry of Frizell—and now we clear the smoke!” and, even with the words, they passed the ditch, which was filled level with the surface just at the moment of their reaching it; and, as they passed it, the dense clouds from the royal cannon, which, after the discharge had ceased, sailed sluggishly down wind and hung about the puritans some minutes longer than around the cavaliers, soared slowly upward, and disclosed the whole of that eventful field. One glance showed Cromwell that the whole right of their position was indeed broken—scattered to the four winds of heaven —and that their centre, though supported by the whole reserve, could scarce maintain itself against the desperate odds with which it was engaged; though, by the fast and rattling volleys, and the repeated charges of the pikemen, he saw that all was not yet over! The second glance showed him the prince in person, with the whole gallant cavalry of his right wing, advancing at full trot to charge him, with scarce five hundred yards between them; while a strong mass of pikemen, intent on turning the extreme left of the Scottish centre, had advanced so far beyond their horse as to expose a portion of their own right flank. “Ardenne!” he shouted, with a voice clear as a trumpet, “away! A flying charge upon the flank of yon pike-regiment—ride over them, wheel promptly, and fall in upon the left flank of Prince Rupert! Buxton, ride thou to Frizell, and tell him not to charge, but to deploy and to maintain his fire! for life! for life! Now for the work. Gallop! ho! Charge! Down with the sons of Zeruïah! Ha! ha! the sword of the Lord and of Gideon!” An instant was enough; his messengers rode like the wind; and with a mighty shout, that rose above the thousand fearful sounds that mingled to make up the thundrous voice of battle, the ironsides plunged headlong on the advancing cavaliers. Five thousand horse at least on either side, splendid in all the vain equipments that cast a false and fleeting light of glory over the ghastly face of havoc! On they went—man to man, and horse to horse, panting for bloodshed as for the breath of life—drunk with excitement—thoughtless of all except the present! The trumpets of the royalists were scarcely audible among the yells and shouts of the wild fanatics. “Ha! Zerubbabel! Down with the cursed of God! Ho! Napthali; on, Benjamin! Strike, and spare not! strike in his name—even his own name, Jah!” The phrensy of their onset, for they charged like madmen rather than cool and steady veterans, together with the slight confusion which always must be felt by an assailing party, which in the very moment of attack is suddenly assailed, would have gone hard against the cavaliers; but when to this was added the continual and well-aimed fire of Frizell's Scotch dragoons, cutting down horse and man along their right by hundreds; and when the fresh and gallant regiment of Ardenne, which—having fallen at an oblique tangent on the right flank of the pikemen, and driven through them like a thunderbolt with an unbroken front—had wheeled, without a second's pause, above the dead and dying, as orderly as on parade, and charged full on the naked left of Ruperts cavalry—it was no wonder that they were cast into complete and irretrievable disorder! For some time all was close and deadly conflict—for such was the ecstatic valour of the gentlemen who battled for the crown, and such the rash and stubborn daring of their leader, that they persisted still, rallying in squadrons or in troops—when their whole line was broken and confused—and still, when these were routed, rushed on in desperate knots of ten OF twelve against the victors, and dealt them death on every hand, with pistol, carbine-but, and broadsword! Five times, at least, did Rupert rally his own regiment, and bring it up to be again repulsed; and, in the last charge, singling Ardenne out, whose prowess he had noticed in the melée, he drove his horse against him, and smote him such a blow as shivered the tried rapier which he raised to guard it to the hilt, and, falling thence with scarce abated violence upon his morion, cleft it down to the hair, but, deadened by the trusty steel, inflicted no wound on the wearer. It was well for Edgar that at this moment a fresh charge by Fairfax, Crawford, and Balgony, who had come up from the right wing across the rear, was made with equal skill and execution—while Cromwell drew off and reformed his troops—bearing the prince and all his bravest backward, pushing his squadrons, utterly defeated, clear off the field, and chasing them with fearful havoc to the very walls of York. A little interval ensued while they called off their stragglers, eager for vengeance, and scattered by the melée; but, ere ten minutes had elapsed, the ironsides, though thinned in number and above half of them wounded, were under their own colours and in their regular ranks. Ten minutes more flew by, and nothing was yet done—they held the ground with not a foe before them—while on their right the enemy's whole infantry, whose flank, by the defeat of Rupert, was open to their charge, was gradually pushing back their own foot, step by step, at the pike's point, from their position. Amazed at this delay, and fearing some mishap, Ardenne intrusted his command to his lieutenant, and, mounting a fresh horse, galloped off in search of Cromwell, whom he found bleeding fast from two wounds, both above his shoulders—one in the neck, a graze, as it was said, by a chance pistol-shot from his own men; the other a smart sword-cut on the collar-bone—and evidently faint and failing from the loss of blood. “A surgeon, ho!” cried Edgar; “bear him away to the rear!” “Not for the world,” said Oliver, in a low voice, but stern. “Shall I go while the Lord has need of me? Form to the right, brave hearts, and follow me! The sword of the Lord and of Gideon!” and, making a last effort to lead them to the charge, he tottered in his stirrups, and would have fallen had not two subalterns supported him and borne him to the rear. “What now, lieutenant colonel?” exclaimed Jepherson from the head of the next regiment as Cromwell was conveyed away. “Heard you not then the general's order?” answered Ardenne. “Each regiment form open column to the right by troops, and charge all on the flank of yon dense mass of musketeers and pikemen! Thou, Jepherson, wheel round upon the rear of you brigade of whitecoats—thou, Desborough, cut thy way through yonder pikemen. Sound trumpets! forward all!” And on they went, with nothing to oppose or Vol. I.—Z stand before them. Regiment after regiment, taken in flank or rear, were cut down, trampled under foot dashed out of the very shape and semblance of array. But now they reached the whitecoats; Newcastle's own brigade, of musketeers and pikemen mingled, four thousand strong, picked men, flushed with success and valiant. Well was it then that Ardenne had wheeled Jepherson upon their rear; for, as he came upon their flank, while they were fighting hard in front with the Scotch infantry, they formed a second face with admirable skill, and opened on him such a fire from their second and rear ranks as emptied wellnigh half his saddles, while their pikes presented an impenetrable rampart against his gallant horses. With difficulty he rallied his own regiment and again brought it to the charge; and, at the self-same instant, Jepherson burst upon their rear. Assailed upon three sides at once, they broke; but fought it out even then, standing in small groups, back to back, refusing quarter to the last, and lying in their lines when dead as they had fought when living! Oh, noble victims! thanklessly sacrificed in the upholding of a tyrant against their country's freedom! slain innocently in an evil cause! Alas! alas for their free English blood, poured out like water on their native soil, not to defend, but to destroy its liberties! With the destruction of the whitecoats the battle in truth ended; for, though a greencoated brigade still offered stout resistance, it was but a last effort of despair. The parliament's whole centre, now relieved from their assailants, moved steadily and promptly up, pursuing the advantage gained by the gallant ironsides, and pressing on the scattered parties of the royalists with such relentless zeal, that they could never rally till they had reached the walls of York. Whole squadrons pushed into the Ouse, were drowned in its deep waters, or pitilessly slaughtered on its banks. The cavalry, with Ardenne at their head, meanwhile still drove right onward; and, wonderful to tell, traversed the whole position of the enemy, from end to end, in perfect and unbroken order, sweeping the relics of that disastrous fight before them as the surf drives the wreck which its own violence has made before its foaming waters. Then, having reached the farthest royal left, they wheeled once more to the right, and actually occupied the ground which Lucas, with his cavaliers, had held at the beginning of the action. The only enemy now left upon the field were these same victors; who, having conquered Fairfax and his tumultuary levies, had pressed with much success upon the flank of Manchester's and Lindsay's regiments of foot, till these stout squadrons, when relieved by Edgar's overwhelming charge upon their enemies in front, found leisure to concentrate all their efforts against the cavalry which had so nigh defeated them, and were in turn repulsing them; when, on the very spot where they had first so roughly handled Fairfax and his northern horse, Ardenne fell on them unawares, and well avenged his comrades. In this last conflict the ground was broken with steep banks and scattered bushes, and the deep channel of the drain alluded to above. Here, as before, the fight was obstinate, and hand to hand, among the troops—when, just as Edgar's men drove Lucas back, killing his horse and making himself prisoner, while all was smoke, and tumult, and confusion, a small but well-appointed troop of cavaliers wheeled round some alder-bushes and charged home. These, for a moment, threw his force into disorder, but unsupported and too weak in numbers, they fell fast, and at the last drew off—their leader fighting desperately to cover their retreat, till a shot struck his charger; and, as he rolled upon the gory and hoof-dinted sod, a savage fanatic shortened his sword to stab the prostrate rider. Edgar's eye caught a glimpse of the gray hairs and noble features that were now disclosed, blood-stained and ghastly, by the falling of his battered monon. With a fierce cry he bounded from his horse—he was—he was in time! He struck one rapier up, received another, which he could not parry in his own sword-arm; but he had saved his father. It was not he alone, however, who had perceived Sir Henry's peril—a desperate rally of his followers was made to rescue him—the tide of fight had rolled away after the flying cavaliers of Lucas; and in an instant, ere he could strike a blow or shout his war cry, Ardenne, second to Cromwell only as the winner of that bloody day, was made a captive, and borne off at a gallop by the flyers from that very field on which his conduct and his valour had retrieved the fortunes of his party when on the very verge of absolute annihilation.
