      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. On a mid-summer's evening so long ago as the year 1803, a King's Yacht was laying at anchor in the river Thames, a cable's length below the tower of London. The twilight was still early, the glow of sunset yet diffusing a rich blush over the warm, hazy skies. The confused hum of the vast city rolled over the water mingled with the deep tones of a bell from some distant tower. A thin, dreamy-looking mist enveloped like a veil of gauze the thousand masts that densely crowded the piers, and half-obscured the spires and turrets scarce less numerous. Above the place where the yacht lay, there stretched, in majestic arches, the series of noble bridges that span the Thames, their avenues thronged with multitudes passing and repassing on foot and in carriges. The sound of feet and wheels in their ceaseless passage fell upon the ear louder than the roar of the opposed current of the river, as it rushed like the rapids of a mountain stream between the strong arches beneath. An officer pacing the quarter deck of the yacht seemed too much absorbed in his own meditations to regard these features of the scene by which he was surrounded. He was a man about thirty-nine years of age, wearing the undress uniform of a first lieutenant in the British naval service. He was tall in stature and well made, with an air of high birth. He was walking very slowly and thoughtfully up and down the starboard side of the snow-white deck. At times he would by degrees relax his pace and then stop altogether, as if buried so deeply in his thoughts as to be unconscious of the motions of his body. At such times his lips would be severely and closely compressed, his dark-gray eye would look black beneath the scowl of his contracting brows, and nervously clenching his fingers in the palm of his hand would give utterance to a suppressed groan of exquisite suffering. Then recalled to the recollection of himself, by the sound he would start abrubtly to resume his walk, and for a few moments pace fore and aft with a quick stern troubled tread. The yacht was one of the most beautiful craft that ever sat upon the water. She was about one hundred and eighty tons burden, and constructed with an eye to the most perfect symmetry, as well as speed in sailing. She carried six brass long eighteens, and fifty men stationed and quartered as in ships in the service. Her officers consisted of a captain, two junior lieutenants and three midshipmen—mere lads. The captain was so styled in courtesy, though his rank was only that of a first lieutenant; but his connection with a branch of the royal family had conferred upon him this favored command and the title of course followed the temporary promotion. The officers, save the Captain, were now in the cabin at supper, and the men forward idly gazing on the shores, or watching the craft in the river, or spinning to each other, with all the superstitious awe of English tars, fearful tales of deeds done in `The Tower,' the black and menacing towers of which flung their gloomy shadows far over the deck of the yacht. The yards of this vessel were squared and her sails furled with the nicest precision. She was a schooner-brig, being a brig only forward. Her appearance upon the water was at once elegant and rakish. Her long slender masts inclined so far over her stern, that her silken pennon, when there was no wind to blow it out, hung perpendicularly down far beyond her davits. The yards were like pencils and her royal masts were so long and delicately tapering that they bent and swayed with gracetul elasticity at the gentle force with which a light wind was now pressing upon them. The masts and spars were of a polished black hue, and nothing to a seaman's eye could be more beautiful than the finished and nautical-like arrangement of her standing and running rigging. Not a rope was out of place, not a lift or halyard that was not in its place. As the yacht was built for pleasure, to convey the Royal party only to the mouth of the Thames, and sometimes, in sunny weather round to Portsmouth, and even to the Isle of Wight, she was not very deep, but sat as lightly and gracefully upon the water as a swan. Her hull was perfectly black save a scarlet line running along the top of her bul warks fore and aft. All her appointments were of the highest order. Ornmament and use were tastefully united in her internal arrangements, and the richness and splendor of her cabins were truly royal. The seamen were picked men and wore a peculiar nautical uniform, neat and appropriate. This beautiful warlike looking yacht as she rode proudly at her anchor, amid the river-craft, which had hove short, or veered out more cable to give her a large space, seemed like a queen among her vassals. She had been laying there, this was the third day, and with that mystery which always envelopes whatever belongs to Royalty, had held no communication with other vessels, nor given any clue towards gratifying the curiosity of those who were conjecturing what her business could be lying so long and perseveringly opposite the Tower. The officer upon her deck after a few more hurried turns during which his fine face, (for his features were noble and handsome though strangely distorted now by inward emotions and passions,) suddenly stopped as a young midshipman appeared upon deck, and cried, sternly, `Lower away third cutter!' `Aye, aye, sir,' answered the reefer, who was a fine looking little scion of nobility, in a very handsome uniform and brown hair curling profusely over his shoulders. `Third cutter away!' The boatswain's whistle piped shrilly the call to the crew of the cutter, and in two minutes the boat was in the water under the starboard gangway, awaiting the captain; for such was the rank of the person who had given the order. Side-boys lined the gangway awaiting him, while `the reefer' had delibe rately taken his place in the boat as coxswain. `My lord,' said the captain to the midshipman, `I shall take the coxswain with me!' The youth, with a disappointed look, reascended the gangway and the captain of the yacht entered the cutter and took his seat upon the crimson velvet cushions in the stern, and, wrapped in his cloak, sat in silence. `Let fall and give way!' cried the coxswain; and the cutter pulled swiftly from the side of the vessel and steered in the direction of the Tower stairs, over which the shades of night were now thickly gathering. `What in the deuce is the matter with the skipper of late?' exclaimed young Percy in inimitable ill-humor, as he followed the cutter in its progress with his eyes. `Dauling is getting savage. I meant to have gone ashore and had a guinea's worth of the opera to night, but instead of that I have got to entertain myself with listening to the howling of dogs from the shore, and watching the dancing of the waters under the counter! What has got into the captain of late, Barron?' `That is impossible to tell;' answered a young mid a year older than Percy, with a dark Italian face and features of great beauty, yet resolute and minly. `He hasn't been the same man the last two days! He looks as black as the old donjon of the Tower there, and it's about as safe to go near the one as the other. The truth is, Fred, I had a curiosity to see what becomes of him at night when he goes ashore, and meant to have kept an eye on his steps. Something is in the wind!' `Perhaps he has incurred the King's displeasure,' answered Alfred Barron. `Dauling wouldn't care much for that. He doesn't love his Majesty much; but that's between you and me!' `And yet the King appointed him to this yacht. His Majesty cant suspect his hostility to him!' `I dont think he does. Yet I shouldn't be surprised if he had been shewing it some way, and it is the fear of losing by it that vexes him. For it was after his return from the palace two days ago he began to look so confoundedly black! Something's to windward and he feels ugly!' `There is no doubt a weight is on his mind. He has eaten nothing to day; and all he has done is to pace up and down the starboard side of the quarter deck like a chained lion.' `See! the cutter does not land at the Tower stairs, but is pulling up along the shipping to the upper pier-stairs. Well, let him go so I cant go with him!' `Do you know what we are laying here for, Percy?' `No, answered the reefer, as he took an impatient turn across the decks.— `Perhaps to take the queen and the small ones to a sea-airing.' `It is my opinion we are to perform quite a different service. We dont usually wait for her Majesty off the Tower. If we had been going to take any of the Royal family on a pleasure-trip to the mouth of the Thames, we should have pulled higher up and lay off St. James' stairs. I think,' he added in a low voice, `I think we are waiting for a state prisoner!' `Who?' `That I cannot tell!' `It may be so. We shall know soon, as we are hove short, and ready for a moment's move!' `Can you see the cutter now?' `No. It is lost in the darkness and confusion of the crowd of river-craft.— We shall know all in good time I dare say, what we are here for. Here comes the first luff out of the cabin, with a Spaniard in his mouth. Let us imitate his example as becomes modest reefers!' Thus speaking the juvenile nobleman of seventeen took two cigars from a silver box he carried in a fob made for its reception, and presenting one to Barron lighted the other with an ingenious apparatus contained in a compartment of the cigar-case. The two young men then walked aft, and seating themselves very comfortably upon the taffrail proceeded to smoke their fragrant Habaneros with the appearance of great personal enjoyment. When the cutter, after quitting the vessel, had got within twenty fathom of the Tower stairs where it had hitherto been accustomed to land the commander of the Royal yacht, he roused himself from his thoughts and looking round said sternly, `Not there! steer the boat to the St. James stairs.' The coxswain obeyed and the cutter, instead of continuing on towards the Tower, the base of which lay in dark shadows, began to ascend the river parallel with the shore. The river bank was lined with shipping and bordered with houses closely crowded together, with here and there the narrow opening of a s reet leading into the heart of the metropolis. The lamps were already lighted, and as the cutter shot by one street after another, momentary glimpses were obtained of the long double lines of lamps with fine effect. The numerous wherries, skiffs and other boats which filled the river, crossing it in every direction; the noise of so many bodies rushing swiftly through the water; the occasional song of a wherry-man rising clear on the calm evening air, for the wind had now gone entirely down; the `heave-ho-yeo,' of seamen getting their anchors; the roar of wheels thundering with ceaseless reverberations over the pavements of the city; the shouting of men to one another; and an alarum of fire in the distance with the wild glow of a conflagration lighting up of the horizon, were the features of the scene and of the moment as the cutter kept her way steadily along through the mazes of the thronged mart. Without heeding any of these things the commander, after giving the brief order to the coxswain to change the course of the boat, resumed his former silence, from which he was only aroused by the cutter's bows touching the foot of St. Jame's stairs. Rising up he sprung to the shore. `Return to the yacht and come for me at twelve o'clock,' he said half turning round to give the order. He then rapidly ascended the stairs, and the next moment was traversing at a rapid step one of the dark dingy thoroughfares that lead from that quarter of London to the west part of the city. He kept on his way enveloped to the mouth in his cloak, and with his cap, which was an ordinary French travelling-cap, pulled down over his eyes as if to escape recognition. On reaching the extremity of the lane up which he had come, he did not turn to the right into the wide and spacious avenue which led towards the better part of the town, but deviated to the left, taking a close, crooked street which seemed to wind through the very heart of the oldest and most obscure portion of the metropolis. As he advanced along this tortuous thoroughfare his step was quicker and his arm moved beneath his cloak as if he was grasping the hilt of a short dagger. The place was by no means calculated to increase the confidence of one passing through it. The houses on either side were very high and seemed to be crowded with teuants like a bee-hive, though without the bee's industry; for all seemed to be steeped in poverty, and idle and vicious. The lower stories were converted into miserable stalls and drinking-taps, the doors of which were thronged with a motley set of both sexes, who seemed congregated around them for no other object than to quarrel and cause confusion. Police officers were seen at intervals slowly promenading the side-walks, but their familiar presence there scarce seemed to check the confusion of oaths, obscenity and drunken laughter! It was with difficulty the commander of the yacht kept his way without contact with these filthy crews,from whom,if he jostled any one by chance,he received the fiercest execrations. He, however, continued his course with a firm, prompt tread, di regarding their menaces, yet with an eye and hand ready to discern and guard against any ruffianly attack. At length he reached the end of this vile thoroughfare and passed by turnin to the right into one that was a little wider but scarcely of better appearance. Its aspect and features, however, were different. The side-walks on both sides were lined with rows of shops dimly lighted. The windows and the inside of the doors were hung with every possible variety of cast-off clothing from a rich court-suit down to a poor scrivener's thread-bare black coat. Chapeaus and round hats, military caps and even swords and pistols were displayed upon the shelves. The interiors were filled with articles of wardrobe, and behind each counter could be seen old men with dark visages, arched eye-brows, large black eyes, high aqueline noses, generally mounted with a pair of iron-rimined spectacles. They were Jews, and this street was the quarter where they did business not only in cast-off wardrobes, but also most of them were money-dealers: for wretched as some of their shops and the habitations above them for their families were, they were far richer than they seemed, and many of them had thousands of pounds loaned at usurious interest to the merchant and the noble. Tudor Dauling, for such was the name of the personage whose progress we are now following, after entering this thoroughfare of the Jews slackened his pace and kept his eyes scrutinizingly fixed on the smoky signs on the opposite side of the way; for although the lamps of the street were far apart, and gave but dim light to the dark pavements, yet the murky light from the farthing candles in the shop windows enabled him to distinguish one sign from another, though with some difficulty. He seemed to be endeavoring to ascertain the location of some one of the tenants of the shop in particular, as if not sufficiently familiar with the place to recognize its exterior. At length he stopped and searchingly regarded the one opposite to him, he succeeded in making out the half-obscured letters on the sign. It was `Enoch Moloch, Jeweler and dealer in apparel.' It was but five steps across the street to the sunken doorway of this tenements which was half shop, half habitation. The stories of the ancient row of houses to which it belonged, rose one above the other to a great height above the low door-way, of the ground story, which appeared to have been pressed into the ground full four feet by the superincumbent weight of the black mass of damp and mouldy bricks above it. Over the door and the square window on the side, projected a sort of roof or `stoope' which turned off the rain from the `old-clothes' which in the daytime hung from a hundred nails driven into the shutters and into the mortar between the corroding bricks. This projection was at a level lower than the heads of the passengers, so that a person entering a shop would have to stoop to avoid bringing his head in contact with it: and to get fairly within the shop he would have to descend two steps. As it was now night, Enoch Moloch the Jew had taken in or rather his two apprentices, black-eyed Israeliteish youths of his own blood, had done it at his command, all the motley array of scarlet, green and blue, gray, black and mixed garments that served to the passers-by as an advertisement of the occupation of the keeper of the shop. The neighbors of the Jew were all his brethren, dealers in the same commodities, and the captain of the yacht as he crossed the street towards the shop of Enoch saw them variously occupied in their stalls, some in smoking huge German pipes, others in bargaining with customers, others standing in their doors talking, and waiting for customers to come in and buy. In Enoch's shop he could discern no one but a Jewish lad in a red cap who sat upon a high stool smoking a short pipe, his black eyes shining like stars through the clouds of tobacco in which he was enveloping his brown face. As Dauling stooped and descended into this stall the lad jumped from his elevated seat on which he was perched and, in a shrill voice, while he bustlingly displayed upon the short counter, a handsome, half-worn court-dress which Enoch had no doubt bought at a bargain: `Sheep sir at doo poun' sax shaylin'! worn birt'-day last, py te kreatest Dook in te hoal kingtom! Puy it, sir! Jis' fit a nople shentleman like you as!' `Where is the Jew?' demanded Captain Dauling with an impatient manner, still keeping his features closely concealed as if fearful of being recognized by any chance passer-by the door; though the dimness of the two yellowish tallow candles that were stuck up in rusty iron-sockets in the shop, afforded sufficient security. `Fader!' cried the lad in a shrill octave directing his voice towards a narrow stair case, the door of which was half hid by hanging garments; `dere ish a shentlemans in te shoop as don't want to puy nothin' put to see you!' In answer to his call a young girl made her appearance, with fine Jewish eyes, and an air of the most finished coquetry. She was not more than eighteen but was tall and nobly formed. She wore a scarlet satin closely fitting her finely developed bust, and affording by its bright cherry hue, a striking relief to her jet black hair and nut-brown complexion. A necklace of rubies sparkled upon her beautifully mouldered neck, and on her bare arms were bracelets the stones of which emitted the same rich crimson light. Her shoes which were wonderfully small, were crimson and covered with spangles, and the heels being full two inches in height, gave her, perhaps, a false height. `My uncle desires to know what your business is, sir?' she said with a searching investigation of her eyes, to discover the features that belonged to the stately figure before her. She spoke in a richly-keyed flute-like tone that fell upon the ear with delightful cadences; while her manner was at once graceful and refined, while it partook, perhaps, something of independence and pride of conscious beauty. `I have been here once before, Mademoiselle Rachel! You do not seem to recollect me,' answered the commander of the yacht in a voice that was accompanied by a slight smile. As he spoke he raised the visor of his cap. `I will tell my uncle who it is,' she said, smiling with recognition and assuming an air of profound respect. `But do you know, fair Jewess?' he demanded quickly. `I know that you have been here before and that you are one of his friends!' she answered with an emphasis on the last word. `Yes, one of his friends!' be repeated in a tone of haughty contempt, as she re-ascended the stair-way. `To do business with these money-dealers, one must be content for the time being to stand on a level with them. Money makes all upon an equality while we trade in it! Nay, it sometimes makes slaves masters. The poor noble may sue to the rich Israelite, aye, fawn upon him to handle his vile gold without which nobility were mockery! But I am not troubled with nobility, though scarce a nobleman in England has such blood flowing in his veins as —' Here the return of the Jewess interrupted his soliloquy. `My uncle desires me to conduct you to him,' she said descending to the shop and directing him with a gesture of her hand to mount the stairs, while she drew aside a Scottish plaid that half-obscured the passage. The captain of the yacht passed her slightly bowing in deference to her sex and beauty, and aided by a glimmer of a light at the top of the flight, which was both narrow and angular, he succeeded in reaching the landing, though the planks bent beneath his heavy tread as he ascended. On reaching this place she passed him, took up the lamp, which was a curious silver one, and leading the way along a sort of common hall, came to a heavily made door at which she tapped with her fingers. `Come in,' answered a deep voice in a strong Jewish accent. The Jewess threw open the door and the captain passed in, the entrance being immediately closed behind him upon the outside by his conductress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. Moloch the Jew. The room into which the commander of the yacht was ushered by the beautiful young Jewess was of a very different character from the other parts of the interior of the dwelling already described. It was large and spacious, and furnished with all the luxury of a nobleman's private chamber. Gold mingled with crimson met the eye in the drapery of the windows and the richest colors covered the chairs and ottomans. The general style of the room and its furniture was oriental rather than English. At a table covered with an embroidered scarlet cloth sat a man about fifty years of age dressed in a lose black gown. A brazen antique lamp suspended above the table cast its beams downward upon his majestic head and features. His high, column-like forehead shaded with short, black locks; his strong arched brows, and large, full, piercing black eyes; his high-bridged and slightly arched nose, and the red fulness and flexibility of his lips betrayed him to belong to the tribe of Israel. A jet black beard mingled with gray descended from his chin to his breast. His size was large and his air noble and imposing. But there was an expression in his eyes of profound avarice, and about his mouth played deceit and cunning. Physically the Jew was a noble specimen of his finely formed race; but morally he looked in every lineament the usurer. As the captain of the yacht entered he was busily summing up a column of figures in a book before him. He did not look up from his occupation until he heard the door close again and the step of the visiter advancing towards him. He then raised his face from his accounts, keeping his forefinger upon the column he had been calculating, and fixing his glance upon him said with a strong Jewish accent, `You are velcom, my lort. Pe pleesh to take a shair! So, you haf come vor more monish?' he added, with a scarcely perceptible glimmer of satisfaction in the expression of his eyes. `You seem to approach the subject abruptly enough, Moloch,' said Dauling coloring, as if displeased at his business being so readily divined and declared to him. `The truth is, it is more money I have come for! Nothing else, you may be assured, would bring me into this infernal quarter.' As he spoke he drew a high-back, crimson chair towards the table before the Jew and placing his arms crossed upon the rich table-covering, he regarded him with a look of anxiety and painful uncertainty. `You haf de shureties, my lort?' said the Jew with a grave aspect and drawing down one corner of his mouth in a peculiar and sinister manner. `You well know I have not, Enoch!' answered Dauling with emphasis, all the color leaving his cheeks. `Then you vell knows dat I has not te moniesh,' responded the Jew coldly, and without moving a muscle of his dark Arabian visage. `I know that you must let me have money, sureties or no,' answered Dauling almost fiercely. `Peace, my lort! Peace in a pargain is more petter nor war! You say you haf want moneish, put you haf not de sureties; I say I vant te sureties for my moneish.' The officer remained a few moments silent, his hand upon his brow. His face was dark and troubled. At length he spoke. `I well knew, Jew, that I could not get money of you, nay not a farthing to save my soul, without security. I was not so ignorant of the cold avarice of thy own heart, or of thy race! Hear me what I have to say and then do as you please; for, as I know you have no principle or conscience where gold is concerned, I am assured what I am about to propose will meet your peculiar views of things.' `If, my lort can get te shureties dem ish all tat ish want,' answered Moloch briefly, and bending his great eyes upon him to listen with them; for he heard and understood more by the expression of the countenance than by the words that fell upon his ear. `You know well, Jew,' said Dauling, gloomily and hesitatingly, `that have no further means! There,' he continued, pointing to an iron box at the Jews feet and which he used as a foot-stool, `there is locked up and the key is at thy girdle, the deed of the only estate I ever owned.' `The gift of thy noble father the Duke,' said the Jew. `Such gift as it was! a mere pittance of twenty thousand pounds! But were it worth a hundred thousand it is no longer mine!' `If shentlemen's vill play tey must expect to lose deir moneish,' answered the Jew, with a twinkle of avaricious gains in the corner of his eye. `I know well the risks of play, Moloch. You know I have suffered from their effects. Cursed be the day I ever adventured the first guinea! But this is past. I have now only to save myself from ruin. `Ruin! Has my lort lost all his moneish?' `I have not a sovereign left of the large sum you let me have when I called to see you last June!' `And no estate now?' `Not an acre!' `Tish very bat, very mootch bat,' answered Moloch with a sympathising shake of his head, while a gleam of pleasure secretly passed across his expression. `Bad! I am ruined, Jew, and you must save me,' cried Dauling with. intense excitement and placing his hand forcibly and earnestly upon the moneylender's wrist. `My lort cannot pe ruined vile te Duke ish livin? He gif my lort a pretty eshtate, ant if my lort tell him he must haf anudder, te Duke vill gif my lort anodder pretty eshtate.' `No. I have seen the Duke my father, Moloch. I have told him that I was in need of money, but he refused to advance me!' `Gid you tell te Duke you had mortgage your eshtate?' asked the Jew quickly. `Yes; but not to whom? I told him my whole situation and how that the mad passion for gaming had step by step brought me to it. He answered me that in giving me what he had, an education befitting my birth, illegitimate though it was, and on my coming of age presenting me with a property worth twenty thousand pounds, that he had done enough for a son who had no legal claim upon him! This was his answer to me, Jew! Moreover, he said that as his influence has obtained for me the command of the Royal yacht, with a very handsome pay, that it was enough for him to do; and that I must now depend on my pay and my character as an officer for my future prospects in my life!' `This looksh vary bat,' said Moloch gravely; for he saw now that he had no further prospect of getting any more gold and silver gains out of the gamester. He spoke gravely and looked coldly and reserved. Dauling at once perceived the change in his manner and divined the cause of it with a ready interpretation. `I have told you frankly the facts relating to myself just as they are,' he said trying to assume a frank bearing and tone as he addressed the Jew. `This interview with the Duke took place five weeks ago!' `But a month after my last loan of five thousand pounds to you. You did not keep it long my lort!' `That is my affair. When I saw the Duke I had not a guinea in the world. After receiving his reply I left him in great rage, though I was careful to disguise it under an appearance of calm, sorrowful submission to his decision. I was in debt two thousand pounds at the moment; debts of honor! incurred within the last three days. It was the necessity of paying these that drove me to my father!' `And now you come to me!' said Molock sternly. `Jew, though I have no means I can make means, therefore return to your civility, which your race measure as you do gold, by gold! I come to you for money but not to pay those gambling debts. They are already paid! paid the very moment they became due! paid within three hours after I quitted my father's presence!' `How?' inquired the usurer opening his eyes with a sort of incredulous surprise. `Enoch,' said the Captain of the Yacht, in a low, deep impressive tone of voice, `I am about to confide to you a secret. Such confidence doubtless is not new to you! You are a money-lender! Your conscience is gilded. You act from self-interest and love of gain! So you keep within the law you do that which seems righteous in the sight of your own eyes. I am about to tell you how I got that money the Duke haughtily and cruelly denied me; and also I am about to inform you how I am to get money from your coffers!' `With shurities, yesh! mitout dem no!' ejaculated Molock significantly touching with his thumb the key of his iron-box which hung at his girdle. `Enoch, you know there is a law in the land against usury!' said Dauling impressively. `And you know you have made yourself amendable to this law by your transactions with me!' The money-lender drew back his person and fixed his eyes with fierce suspicion upon the gamester. `Nay, do not fear, Enoch! no one shall know that you have taken from me twenty thousand pounds for eight thousand! or loaned me money at forty-two percent. You confided in my honor, and if I did not regard my own I should fear the scorn of all honorable men, should I be an informer. Yet it is in my power to do you mischief! But I only allude to this, that I may have assurrance of your secrecy in the matter I am about to confide to you. Perhaps, however,' he added with a haughty contempt, `perhaps I shall find a surer security in your love of money!' `Vat secret ish given to me in pusiness I never petray, my lort,' answered Molock with a countenance wholly unmoved by the insulting words and manner of the Duke's son. `Know then, Enoch,' said Dauling, lowering his voice and approaching his lips to the Jew's ear, `that I obtained the money by drawing a check for it in the Duke's name!' `Forged a draft? exclaimed the usurer with a look of astonishment. `Yes,' answered Dauling bolding. `What else could I do? I was owing debts of honor to the amount, as I told you, of two thousand pounds! They had to be paid within three hours, for I had spent several hours in searching for the Duke to get an interview! Debts of honor are imperious! I left the palace of my father with my decision formed; and in a coffee-house not far distant, drew a check of three thousand pounds on the Duke's banker. I had no fears of detection from the signature for I knew it was perfect; and as I presented it myself I knew it would not be closely scrutinized!' `You were a very pold man, my lort, to offer the draft yourself! It vas very dansherous, my lort!' `I had no alternative. The draft was cashed. I paid my debts of honor and felt relieved.' `Vary moosh, I tare say, my lort,' said the money-lender with a slight shrug of the shoulders. `With the other thousand I repaired to the L— Rooms to play for the purpose of winning enough to replace the amount of the draft at once. I succeeded in my wishes and the next day replaced the sum I had drawn, and by a dextereous manœuvre got possession of the forged draft, which else would have been retained on file against me.' `You vere fortunate, my lort,' said the usurer, who had listened with interest to his money operations; for those who boldly managed, were always entertaining to him. `Yes, it might have gone hard with me had it met the Duke's eye. But I was shortly in want of more funds, and having one night gone ashore after a week's pleasure trip with the yacht to Portsmouth, at the place to play. I lost every thing. I had not a half-crown left. I had to stay in Portsmouth some two days longer as the Queen and her party, whom I had taken down, were not yet ready to return. I could not be two days in Portsmouth without money. So I resolved to try the Duke again.' `Vas he in Portshmouth, my lort?' asked Moloch dryly. `I tink if he vas you would get no monish no more as pefore.' `No, the Duke was at his seat near London. But I had no intention of making a personal application. My proud spirit had been too keenly wounded before. No, Enoch, this is what I did! I made a draft on his Grace for five thousand pounds, drawing it in my own name and forging the Duke's acceptance to it. This draft I made at thirty days. Well, I got the money upon it in Portsmouth and the draft was sent to a banker here for collection! As my ill-fortune would have it the Queen's daughter the princess Amelie was taken ill at Portsmouth and the Royal Party decided on returning to Windsor by land. Two weeks of my draft's time had already passed when this decision was made, and I then weighed to sail round to London alone. But I lost my foretopmast in a gale and was forced to put into Cowes to repair. With all the haste I could press matters, it was a week before I could leave there, and adverse winds made it four days more before I reached the Thames. From the Pilot I received a packet which I found to be from the Secretary of state, ordering me to proceed up the river with the yacht and anchor off against the Tower until further orders. I have been at my anchorage now this is the third night without receiving any orders, although I have reported myself. The truth is I have my fears that my forgery is discovered and that I may see the inside of the Tower. I know it is for the Duke's interest to get me out of the way; and as he would not like to bring me and his family matters up before the criminal tribunal, he may have taken advantage of his discovery and engaged for me a snug birth for life in one of the dungeons of the Tower. He has only to breathe his wish and the thing is done at his will! This is however, perhaps, only an unfounded notion of my own fears. But the fact is that my draft is due to-morrow and that if it is not paid then the Duke must hear of it before night.' `You did vary ill, my lort, to gif your own name to it! Any oder name, mit de Duke's acceptances was just as goot. 'Tis was vary wrong.' `I see it was now!' `Vary. If you bad put anodder name, den te Duke vould nevar know it vas you!' `But you forget that without some responsible name I could not have got the draft done. I had no person but myself. The broker I knew would take my draft without question!' `I see, I see! Vat you say is correct, my lort. You could not vell done oter vays! Tish a pad pusiness!' `You must help me out of it,' cried Dauling with anxiety. `It is a vary pad pusiness,' repeated Enoch a second time, shaking his head very gravely. `Haf you no moneish, my lort?' `I lost every pound I had received at Portsmouth, except two hundred, before I left there. That two hundred I left to play with when I got to London.' `And tis moneish—tis doo huntret pounts! Haf you lost tis too?' `All! I was fortunate the first night of my arrival and won! But last night I lost every thing. To-morrow the draft comes due! I drew it with the hopes of being able to win enough to meet it before its maturity! But you have seen how I am at fault,' he said bitterly; and rising he paced the rich carpet of the Jew's private chamber with a hurried step. `Vhy dit you not draw on te government ant set te amount down to damashes?' asked the wily banker. `Ha! you are as deep as I am, Moloch,' exclaimed the captain of the yacht stopping and laughing with a sardonic expression, as he regarded Enoch's tace. `Know, oh. Jew; that I have done this thing already from Cowes; but I did it only for three hundred and fifty pounds over the damages the gale did the yacht! If I could have drawn for five thousand with safety, or any chance of its being paid, I would have done it you may depend.' `Vat dit my lort do mit te tree hundret ant vivty pounts?' `Lost every farthing of it before I left that port.' `My lort loves play vary moosh.' `It is a passion with me! But, I swear to you, Moloch, if you will help me pay this sum to-morrow I will never play again.' `Vat interest has te Jew in my lort's play? 'Tis just te same to me if my lort play or my lort stop play. I haf no interest in te matter ony as I gets all my moneish vish I has got, pleash fader Abraham!' `True. I ought to know that on the contrary you thrive on other men's vices and follies. But I must have money to-morrow, Moloch. The broker holds the draft and unless it is paid before two o'clock it will be presented to the Duke. He only would want such a plea for getting well rid of me! His daughter, my legitimate sister, is now coming forward in her tenth year, and he thinks I might not honor the relationship! In a word he would not hesitate either to give me up to the authorities as a forger, or by consent of the King place me secretly in the Tower. I never see the King's boat quit the stairs but I think it is coming on board for me! Help me to get this draft off my hands and I will do anything for you, Enoch?' `Te Christian plead humbly to te Jew vhen he would haf money; and curses him vhen he no more needs him! Vat can the Jew do? Shew me how I can let you haf money?' `I want five thousand pounds. Security I have none. Nay, do not smile so sneeringly! Listen! The money I must have to-morrow, else I am a ruined man! Bastard though I am yet. I am a gentleman and men treat me as such. I have royal blood in my veins and am proud of it. Before the world I would keep it untarnished by any low crime. Nor would I give my father cause to get rid of me by having him make the discovery of my forgery. To conceal it I am ready to commit a greater! Moloch, you have money, and by money you live. More, more, MORE is your cry! You ask not for the sources of the golden stream that flows into your coffers. You care not whence it comes, be it from Palestine or Pagandom, so as you are enriched. Now to get the money I want I am ready here, with this pen I have seized in my grasp to put the Duke's name to paper in any shape and to any amount under twenty thousand pounds that you may draw up! You shall cash it, and for your pay receive a thousand pounds down beside the usual discount.' Moloch's eyes brightened and his whole manner instantly changed. `Vill my lort make a draft for twenty tousant in his own name and endorse it mit te Duke's?' `I will do it,' answered the captain of the yacht, with emphasis, his features lighting up with hope as he fastened his gaze earnestly upon the face of the Jew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. The Forged Draft. The money-lender was thoughtful a moment and seemed to be weighing the risks. At length he spoke and said, `My lort, you say you vant tventy tousant pounts. Vary goot! Tventy tousant pounts is moosh money. `I would rather not make it more than ten thousand. `Vy no more dan den tousant?' `Because I may not be able to repay it!' The Jew laughed with his eyes in a manner peculiar to him, and replied, `Vor dat matter, my lort, it might pe von huntret tousant. Put to the pusiness. You haf five tousant to pay to-morrow?' `I have or am ruined!' `You haf no shurities?' `Not a guinea's value.' `You come to me to ashk me to loan you ten tousant pounts?' `Yes; for which I will give you a forged acceptance of my father!' `All vary goot, vary,' said Moloch dryly, and lifting his arched eye-brows; `but if I cash dis paper vot am I to do mit it?' `Present it to the Duke's banker. It will be paid.' `Of dat I haf no doubt. my lort. But vhen it is py ant py discover to pe a forshery, vat shall I do?' The captain of the yacht paced the room several times in perplexity before he replied, `Make it twenty-five thousand pounds and you are at liberty to say that I presented it to you. `Den vhy did you not forge te acceptance, my lort, for tis amount and presend it yourself mitout comin to me?' For this reason: I had began to conceive that the Duke's Banker suspected me. I was afraid to offer another, and especially while the one that is due tomorrow remains unpaid. This alone would lead to a suspicion; for the Duke's banker knows of the existence of my draft from Portsmouth, the broker who has it for collection having gone to him to get his testimony as to the signature. This I learned this morning from the broker in a round-about way.— Therefore, Moloch, I had no resource but to make a confidant of you.' `If I cash an acceptance for twenty-fife tousant pounts, why are you more villing I should tell I got it from you my lort, dan if it vos only vor ten?' asked Enoch, eying him closely. `Because I see now what did not occur to me at first, that you will be held responsible when you present the draft on which you have given me the money unless you can give the name of the person from whom you received it; for it must at maturity be discovered to be a forgery. Therefore, I have made up my mind if my name must be given it shall be for a sum of high value. But pledge me, Moloch, that you will only give my name when you are called upon to the Duke in person and in private!' `Dis I promise. Then give me paper and let me make the draft. For what time shall it be?' asked Dauling, seating himself and removing his cap, exposing, as he did so, a noble head and kingly brow that bespoke his royal lineage. An expression stern and dark clouded his features and marred with guilty purposes the dignity of his manly countenance. `Tree days!' `Three days! Thirty it must be?' `It is safer at tree day,' answered the Jew quietly. But three days will not give me any time to win at play?' `Nor will thirty, my lord. Tree day or not at all. Pefore thirty day te Duke may shange his banker ant I lose all I gif you pefore I get it pack again.' But I expected if you gave me the money on it to-night you would take it to the Duke's banker in the morning and get it discounted and off your hands.' `No. I sall take it to te banker just two minute no more, just two minute pefore te last hour of its payment expires. I sall den hand it to do banker and he vill pay it vith hurry so as not haf time to look too sharp, pecause he would not like to haf te Duke's name dishonored py delay. Therefore, as I must lay out of my moneish, I cant pe out of longer den tree day.' `Well, three days then! My mind is made up as to the step I shall take, if I once get this Portsmouth draft taken up.—Three days, he added in a halftone and frowning till his brows met, `three days will serve me as well as three hundred. What I have resolved upon I shall execute. I will once more meet my father. Three days is long enough to put off the meeting. You are waiting for me, Enoch. Well, I will write and sign. The commander of the yacht then rapidly wrote a draft upon the Duke of —, for the large amount of twenty five thousand pounds, and was about to sign it with his own name when the Jew laid his hand upon his: `You must put some oder name, my lort, if as you say, you are suspected! `Whose?' demanded Dauling suspending his pen over the paper. `Can you imitate this closely?' asked Moloch, drawing a note of hand from a black leather pocket-book and showing him the signature of `Foster, Murray &amp; Co.' at the bottom of it, one ofthe wealthiest banking firms in London `Yes,' answered Dauling on glancing at it. `Sign den, dis names to de draft! It vill pe petter nor yours, my lort.' Dauling did not hesitate to do as he was requested, and placed the forged signature accurately imitated at the foot of the draft. `Now te Duke's acceptance!' said Moloch after he had examined carefully the two signatures, and smiled approvingly. The officer with a ready pen placed the forged acceptance of his father, across the face of the draft and the paper was completed!' `Vary goot,' said the Jew placing his spectacles more closely upon his eyes and carefully inspecting the draft. `'Tis now goot negoshiable papers!— Twenty fife tousand pounts ish a goot deal of moneish! It vill make de Jew poor to give all dis! Put if I vill do dis paper for you, my lort how mooch vill my lort gif me vor de risks?' `Two thousand pounds!' The money-lender smiled sneeringly. `No, no, my lort! I must haf ten tousant ant gif you te palance!' This was spoken very positively. Dauling fixed upon him a look of surprise and anger, and seeing by his countenance that he was in earnest he exclaimed fiercely, `Accursed Jew! Do you dare to propose such a thing to me! I will give you no more than two thousand pounds.' `Den I can't do it my lort!' answered Moloch firmly and calmly. `I will give you three thousand, and not a guinea more so help me the God of Abraham!' `Den dere is an end to our pusiness, my lort!' coldly said Moloch turning his attention again to his accounts, in poring over which the entrance of Dauling had interrupted him. The captain stood and regarded him with dark looks for a moment and then said in a changed tone, `Enoch, I will make it five thousand. Pay me twenty and let me depart; for my time is measured!' `Not a farthing less, my lort!' `Are you not satisfied that the draft can be discounted?' `It is perfectly goot, my lort,' he answered smoothing it over with his forefinger as it lay upon the table before him. `Then you have no risk. All the risk is mine, as you will give up my name when you are called upon to declare how you came by it! You shall have only what I have offered you! `Ten tousant pounts, my lort!' answered Enoch without lifting his eye from his accounts. `Ten thousand devils! I will not give it! You are a brazen-faced usurer, and know you, Jew, that you are in my power! You know that you have infringed in the most bare-faced manner the severe Statutes recently enacted against usury, and have laid yourself open to all its terrible penalties. Your vile terms have exasperated me; and I now swear to you that unless you do this on my terms I will make you a public example. You are in my power and beware.' `And you, my lort are in mine,' responded the money-lender taking up the forged draft and thrusting it into his bosom.' So long as I hold this evidence of your guilt I do not fear you!' As Moloc hspoke his lip curled with a bitter smile of triumph aungled with contempt. `Ha! Do you dare, infernal Israelite?' cried the Commander of the Yacht, drawing his sword and springing upon the Jew to wrest from him the fatal paper. Moloch who was a taller and larger man than his visitor, though Dauling himself was of a powerful frame, sprung to his feet and seizing the wrist of his sword arm with a pressure that caused him to drop the weapon at his feet. As it fell Moloch kicked it across the chamber, and then releasing him said calmly, `Dis ish no vays, mine lort, to get your monish! If you vants your draft take it and seek some other broker.' As he spoke he drew from his breast the paper and laid it upon the table. Dauling stood silent and gloomy, looking irresolute. He did not extend his hand to take up the draft, glad as he would have been to have had possession of it by force the moment before. `Moloch,' he at length said in an impassioned tone of voice, `let us not be foes! Give me fifteen thousand on the condition you will not give up my name as a party. I begin to fear that it will be unsafe. My plan was to let you give it up to the Duke alone when you should be called upon, telling him it was purchased by you from me in the way of business; and I then contemplated calling on the Duke in person, confessing the whole, and assuming the penitent, throw myself upon his mercy; which, if I failed in, I meant to take another course, which it is not expedient to detail to you. I shall, however, still see him in person! But I fear that the Duke will think more of the loss of his twenty five thousand pounds than of my relationship to him and give me up to the laws! In a word I dare not trust him. Therefore, if you can devise any other way by which to escape the responsibility, and I know you are fruitful in expedients, I will give you ten thousand pounds.' Here Dauling paused; for he saw that the money-lender was already thinking deeply, as if struck by his suggestion and its feasability. The Jew sat silent full three minutes his eyes fixed upon the carpet and his manner wholly that of one absorbed in some deep project. Dauling watched him closely and anxiously. At length the Moloch raised his head and said, `My lort, 'tis a great risk, vary great dangers, put I vill do it! Your name sall not pe gifen. I can do it mitout, put te risk is immense, my lort.' `And the sum I give you is immense.' `It ish a vary goot sum, my lort,' answered Moloch indifferently. `You vill half fife tousant to take up your draft from Portshmout, and ten tousant left, and no fear from arrest for forsherg! Ten tousant pound to me is not moosh for all dis happenesh.' `You swear you will not devulge my name.' `I shwear it.' `Place your hand upon your thigh and swear it by the faith of Israel,' he said commandingly. `I shwear it by the faith ov Israel, my lort,' answered Moloch, laying his hand upon his thigh and speaking the words with solemnity. `Now I am free again,' cried Dauling with animation. `Please you, good Enoch count out your soverigns and bank-notes.' `So much monesh I haf not in my house, my lort. If you vill call to-morrow at elefen o'clock, you sall haf te vivteen tousant pounds.' `I must have it to-night,' he demanded imperiously. `I haf not one tousand pounts in my shest, my lort! Mine moneish ish in te panks. Come to me in te mornins' at elefen and you sall haf te moneish!' The officer stood a moment silent and thoughful and then replied, `Be it so, Moloch. At eleven o'clock I shall be here! Now a good night to thee!' `Goot night my lort,' answered the Jew; and taking up a little silver bell that stood before him upon the table, he rang it and the beautiful Rachel came into the chamber. `Neice, see this gentleman down stairs and through the shop,' he said to her. `I am honored by so fair a guide, charming Jewess,' said Tudor Dauling bowing with an air of gallantry to her; although this courteous manner sat ill with the haughty and sinister expression that was upon his features, as if he despised the race to which the young girl belonged, while he admired her physical beauty. `My niece little understands the fair words of flattery, my lort,' said the Jew coldly as if displeased. `Nay, Enoch, I am no gallant for the sex. Little care I for any of them, else might I seek to mend my fortune,' he added in a tone meant only to reach the Jew's ear, `by taking a wife. But seldom have I given them more than a passing glance, for rare must be the beauty that causes my eye to linger. Such beauty is that of thy niece! But good night. To-morrow at eleven! Fair daughter of Abraham I follow thee.' Thus speaking the captain of the yacht preceded by Rachel, who all the while had stood silent and down-looking, left the sumptuous private chamber of the rich money-lender, Enoch Moloch, and passing down the dark stairscase emerged into the shop below. Then with a slight bow he took leave of the Jewess, and wrapping his cloak closely about his face went forth into the street and rapidly pursued his way in the direction of the strand. Rachel lingered a moment, with her forefinger placed upon her lip, as if reflecting upon the mingled indifference and admiration towards her of the dark featured noble looking stranger, when the sound of the silver bell recalled her to he uncle's presence. `Well, neice, what think you of my noble visitor,' said Moloch, speaking in the Hebrew tongue with a dignity of accent and enunciation that singularly contrasted the badly pronounced English he had made use of in his conversation with Tudor Dauling. `Is he noble?' asked the maiden and she seated herself upon an ottoman opposite to him. `What dost thou think of him?' repeated Molock with a half-smile; forduring his brief interval that had elapsed since the departure of the commander of the yacht he had conceived a thought in his inventive brain, which the last words of the other had given bot spark and fuel. `I think him a man of large statute, about eight and thirty years of age, with a haughty air and a countenance exceedingly noble and handsome yet at the same time singularly forbidding.' `Could you love him, Rachael?' The Jewish maiden started slightly, and then opening her large black eyes rested them upon the face of Molock with an expression of surprise and alarm. `Love him! oh no! I should fear him were he powerful and I in his power.' `Yet methinks he looked kindly upon thee!' `It was not a look a maiden could meet or that would please her. It was cold and supercilious at the same time insultingly condescending. So might a cavalier regard a handsome gipsey in her rags! Why dost thou ask me these questions with such a serious face? Is the man not a Christian? Am I not a Jewess? You mock me in asking me if I would love him!' she said with a look of displeasure the proud style of her beauty. `Nay, be patient, Rachael. Christians and Jews have wed ere now. You are now of full age to have a husband. You have refused more that one Israelitsh youth who has sought your hand of me. Your heart is therefore free. This stranger who just left us is by no means so bad a man as to his heart as you think. He has been in great perplexities and they have soured his visage. He is nominally a Christian but I assure you he has as much reverence for Joshua as Jesus. His religious scruples will not be in the way. I am desirous that you should try to captivate him and win him.' `Would you have me marry him indeed, uncle?' she asked earnestly. `Truly I would.' `He would scorn me. Besides I know him not. Nor could I wed a man I have no love for, much more a Christian,' she said jeeringly; and rising up she walked the space before the table with a quick tread and a look much excited. Moloch, in the meanwhile sat perfectly composed yet with a firm aspect. `Know you, Rachel, that this man is not only noble, but Royal?' `How?' `He is the illegitimate son of the Duke of —, the near relative of the King. The Duke has no other son, but one daughter about ten or twelve years of age, by a later marriage with the sister of Prince —.' `His royalty is tarnished by his birth! I regard him less noble than I did before.' `But the world does not. Men look upon him in the same light as if he were born in wedlock. The blood flowing in his veins covers all disgrace. He is admitted into society with honor and save the title and inheritance is as good as the Duke's lawful son. His father was greatly attached to him until he became married and had a daughter, when by the influence of the Dutchess he was sent a way from the paternal roof. The rest of his time till he came of age he passed at Eton school and at Oxford, the Duke in the meanwhile lavishly supplying his expenses. But after he became of age he pursued a course of the most extravagant dissipation; which, at length, reached to such lengths that the Duke became embarrassed to meet his exorbitant drafts to pay gambling debts; for gaming was his passion. Finally his father after long forbearance, firmly refused longer to give him money. But he made over to him an estate worth about twenty thousand pounds, on the condition that he should reside on it, live within its income, and marry within one year. Tudor subscribed to the terms and conditions and returned to his estate. Here he did remain very quiet for a year, but yet did not marry. Nevertheless the Duke did not insist upon this so long as he was steady. There he remained until last year in the most perfect retirement, but the secret of his content was, that he had surrounded himself there with all the gay scenes he so much loved in London. Fine rooms in his villa were fitted up as gaming rooms, and his house was the resort and almost the habitation of the principal gamblers of the metropolis. He took for his part a certain percentum of all the money won there by others and by this means lived, and lived expensively. As the Duke never came to see him, this state of thing's only reached his ears inpartial statements, and by no means in their truth, as Tudor conducted all thing's about his establishment with the greatest caution and secrecy. But his good fortuneturned and reverses rendered it necessary he should mortgage his property. The deeds of the whole are in this chest,' added Moloch placing his foot upon the iron box at his side. `And this is the man you wish me to sacrifice myself to, uncle,' cried the Jewess with indignant surprise. `Nay, listen to what more I have to say, and then decide,' he answered with composure. `I will hear you, uncle,' she replied, reseating herself upon the ottoman and folding her arms upon her bosom with a haughty air that exceedingly became her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. The Bank-Clerk. Moloch proceeded for a few moments to explain to Rachel, more in detail, the nature of the business which the captain of the yacht had with him. When he had ended he said with a scorching look, surveying her handsome intelligent face, `Do you clearly understand all this, niece?' `Perfectly, uncle!' `Now I will tell you how you can serve me in obtaining this money on the draft. I have to run all the risks and my lord is not to be known in the transaction. Neither do I wish to be. Here, you see, is the paper which he has so boldly forged!' added Moloch, showing her the draft. `He has not only forged his father's acceptance but the names as drawers of one of the first bankers in London. The paper is good—none better if it can be made to pass.' `How can I serve you, uncle?' `By disguising yourself as a young gentleman to-morrow and driving in a cab to the Duke's banker and presenting the draft in person!' `What costume shall I assume?' `That of a banker's clerk. I have the costume in the shop. The disguise must be perfect and complete. You nor I must never be suspected in the matter, and I shall trust to you to play your part with skill.' `Have I ever deceived your confidence, uncle?' `No, child, no! You are faithful and artful. I feel I can trust you. You will present the bill at the Cashier's desk, as clerk of the House which draws it. It will be paid if you are self-possessed.' `I shall be composed, uncle.' `That I am convinced of. The third day the forgery will necessarily be discovered, and then you will find the usefulness and necessity of your disguise. As a young man, seemingly, was seen to present the bill, they would never think of suspecting a female. Thus you will escape as well as myself.' `There is danger, uncle; but I will undertake it. There is nothing I will shrink from to serve you and do injury to the Christian!' As she spoke her dark eyes flashed and her lip curled with the proud hatred a beautiful Jewish woman only can express when she speaks of the persecutors of her race. `If then you would injure them farther, wed this Duke's son! You know what I have secretly confided to you touching him. It is true. You see what it will avail you. Do as I wish—wed him and your reward will be what I have told you.' `Of this I will think by and bye, uncle. At present let me only give my thoughts to the perilous task you have imposed upon me.' After some further directions given by Moloch to his neice she took up a light and bidding him good night left the chamber to retire to her own: while the money-lender, after locking his strong box and arranging his papers, went down into his shop to give orders to the two Jewish lads to close it for the night. Tudor Dauling left the habitation of the Jew with a feeling of disappointment which was, however, somewhat modified by the hopes held out on the morrow. Nevertheless he was chagrined and vexed at being unsuccessful in obtaining from Moloch even a sufficient sum to enable him to venture a stake at play. The night before he had lost his last guinea and this evening came on shore with the view, if he obtained means from the money-lender, to make an effort to recover his losses. But he had now left his shop without anything beyond a promise for the next day. `It is useless for me to seek the playing saloon with empty pockets! he said as he came to the corner of two streets, one of which led to the Halls he had so much frequented, the other to the stairs opposite his yacht. At length, after lingering a few moments he slowly retraced his steps towards the water-side. As he reached the stairs he discovered, by the light of a lamp, a youth approaching. As he came nearer he saw that it was Percy, one of his midshipmen. The lad was passing him; but after eying him closely he stopped and addressed him, touching his cap. `Captain Dauling?' `Well Percy.' `Ah, then it is you, sir. I wasn't quite sure!' `Where are you going? Why are you ashore to-night?' `I came to seek you, sir.' `And pray where were you going to find me?' asked Dauling sternly yet with irony. `To St. —'s Saloon, sir.' `So then you know where I have been of late, youngster?' `Yes, sir. If you remember, I came ashore with you the last two nights and passing up the town after you, I saw you enter there.' `Well, well. Never go there yourself, boy, if you want to be a happy man. Why do you seek me now?' `An express has just come aboard the yacht to see you, sir; but as you were ashore, I was sent to find you, if possible, with instructions to place this pacquet in your hand. When the man-at-arms gave it to me, he left, and relanded at the Tower-stairs. I immediately took the third cutter by command of the first lieutenant, and pulled ashore, and was going to seek you, sir, when you passed me.' `Let me see the package. Ah! the king's secretary's band, and the royal seal,' he exclaimed, taking it from him and stepping under the quay lamp which burned near. `It was a king's livery-man, who came with the man-at-arms that brought it, sir,' answered Percy. Dauling broke the seal, and after reading the contents a few moments, he seemed troubled. `An order to get underweigh at sun-rise, and lay to off the tower, to take a States' prisoner on board,' he said with a muttered tone of ill-humor, and displeasure. `This order I can never obey. I must be present to take up my draft of five thousand pounds. Moloch might be trusted to pay it, but trust him I will not. If I go my honor is lost, for my forging will be divulged to the world, and I cast into a felon's cell. Hold! I have a thought. Cannot some way be invented to delay this matter one day—or even till afternoon?— By three o'clcck I should have my forged draft in my hand and be free, with the additional sum advanced by the Jew. I could pray for a storm or for a lightning bolt to shiver my foremast, or do a damage to the yacht to detain her; for only some accident can set aside this order of his majesty. Confound this new duty I am put upon. I thought when I took the yacht I should have all holiday-work, sailing the queen and the royal cortege from place to place. This order I cannot obey. I am ruined if I obey it. Ah, I have the idea!— Percy.' `Sir.' `Are the men in the boat?' Yes, sir.' `Follow me.' Dauling hastened down the platform to the steps and springing into the cutter, sternly bade the men give way out into the stream. He took the helm himself sending the coxswain forward to take the bow oar. `Now, Percy,' he said in a low tone to the midshipman as he leant back in the stern-sheets, `I want a little peice of service from you.' `What is it, sir?' `Do you see the coal barge that was moored up stream just above the yacht at sun-down?' `Yes, sir, I believe I do,' answered Percy, after looking off into the river and endeavoring to distinguish the craft in question from multitudinous others achored all around them. `You remember its position was just in a line with the current above us.' `Yes sir; and that you bade them take care how they anchored or they would drift foul of the schooner.' `The same vessel! Now what I want you to do is this. I am steering directly for the barge. When I reach her side I will pass near enough for you to spring on board over the bows. The crew, at this hour, will be all turned in below. After I leave you on board I will pull for the yacht. When you see me fairly on my deck, I want you to slip or cut the barge's cable and let her drift dead upon the yacht's bows.' `She will carry away her bowsprit if not do more mischief, sir,' answered Percy with surprise. `She will do no more than carry away the bowsprit, for the current is not strong enough for her to do more harm!' `And do you want any done, sir?' inquired the midshipman with surprise. `Yes. Percy would you like to go to the opera to-morrow night?' `Of all things, sir.' `The package you gave me contained an order from the King for me to get underweigh at sun-rise in the morning.' `Then I cant go to the opera to-morrow night,' answered Percy in a desponding tone. `No, not unless the barge should happen to fall foul of the yacht and carry away enough to make it necessary to delay for repairing damages. Do you think such an accident likely to happen?' asked the captain dryly. `I would bet a month's pay on it,' answered Percy; that is,' he added significantly, `if thereby I go to the opera to-morrow night!' `That you may be sure of,' answered Dauling. `I have a good reason of my own for wishing to delay my departure a day or two. So let us manage this little affair between us.' `I am ready, sir,' answered Percy promptly, and elated at the prospect of the adventure before him and the opera as the reward of his tact and skill. `Here we are close aboard,' cried Dauling as the boat ranged up under the black sides of one of the huge coal-barges of the Thames. `Spring lightly and free.' The next instant the young midshipman stood upon the deck of the hulk and Dauling in his cutter shot away down stream in the direction of the yacht.— Percy walked forward without noise, and found all still. A single lamp, only, burned dimly in the gloomy fore-cabin, the doors of which were ajar. `They are all asleep,' he said after making his observations. `But I shall soon wake them up with a sudden surprise.' He then went aft, and following, with his eye, the course of the cutter, saw it reach the yacht. He then examined the cable and seeing there were but three or four turns round the windlass, he concluded to slip it by cutting the stoppers instead of severing the cable with his knife. A single stroke was sufficient, and the cable run out rapidly through the hawse-hole and fell, splashing into the water. The barge no longer feeling the strain binding her to her anchor, fell off and floated away from her moorings. The swift current soon bore her onward upon its bosom, and with a fearful velocity the huge body came sweeping down upon the yacht. Percy seeing that she was likely to strike the schooner stern on, and do more mischief than was wanted, seized the helm and, with great exertion, gave her a sheer obliquely, so that her starboard quarter would strike the head of the schooner. Nearer and nearer she came surging downward upon the arrowy tide, threatening destruction to the graceful little vessel which lay in her course. All was at once bustle and excitement on board the yacht; for her captain, at the first perceptible change in the position of the barge had given the alarm and secured his bows from damage by fenders thrown over them by his crew. Still, as he saw how rapidly the dark body was coming down upon him, he trembled for his vessels security, and gave quick and repeated orders to his men to stand by and defend her bows! He had the cable loosened and slipped so that it would easily pay out, that the schooner might be in motion also, and so deaden the force of the shock. But with all this precaution the barge came heavily upon them, crashing and shivering every thing that projected beyond the bows, flying-gib-boom, gib-boom and bow-sprit, crushing them, with the martingale and figure-head, all together, in one confused mass of ruin and devastation; while the force with which she struck her hull made the light vessel tremble to her kelson. The confusion on board the barge was hardly less than that upon the deck of the yacht; and amid the mingled curses and denunciations of the crews of both vessels, the barge swung herself clear just as Percy, unseen, by his own people, leaped into the schooner's fore-rigging. The hulk was borne by the current far astern, and soon disappeared in the darkness; while the crashing and cursing that, at intervals, came from the direction which she had taken, bore to the ears of those on board the yacht, the evidence that she had served other vessels in the same manner she had treated the royal craft. The result of the `accident' wasthat the next morning the yacht, instead of getting underweigh, was hauled into the Tower dock to have her damages repaired; Dauling having previously sent word to the secretary of the situation of his vessel. The same forenoon, at the appointed hour, he repaired to the Jew's habitation. Moloch was in his shop cheapening a Dutch cloak to a customer. `Ah, my lort, I'm glat to see you. Volk up stair mit me, iv you pleash.' On reaching the private chamber of the money-lender, Dauling said, impatiently, `Now, Moloch, the money?' `It ish not come in from de panker. Vait a leetle ant it vill pe soon here, my lort.' `Have you arranged it so that I shall not appear in the matter?' `Yes, my lort. You vill be all safe.' At this moment the chamber door opened and a dark young man entered. On seeing the guest he would have withdrawn but Moloch beckoned him to advance. `Have you the money?' he asked in Hebrew. `I have, uncle.' `You are true and faithful and a worthy daughter of Abraham. Keep composed for the Christian plainly does not recognise you!' `Speak in a Christian tongue, Moloch. I like not unknown words bandied about over my head in this fashion. Is it the clerk who went for the money?' `It is. Who paid it and how did you manage?' said the Jew, addressing the disguised Rachel in English. `I went to the bank, and entering sought the cashier's desk, and presenting the draft, waited until he had examined it.' `Was he long?' asked the Jew eagerly. `Not more than a minute. He then counted out the money to me and took my receipt for it. So I signed my name to it.” `Your own name?' said Moloch alarmed and speaking in Hebrew. `No, uncle. I signed that which first occurred to me. It was John Isaacs.' `And you took the money and left?' he coutinued in English. `Yes.' `Did any one seem to suspect?' `No.' `Thou hast done well. Return till I shall call for thee.' `Bravo! the youth has done Bravely,' cried Dauling as he saw the pile of notes before the Jew. `So you don't appear in the matter at all. We are both safe, Moloch, and the money in our hand; what youth is this who has performed his part so bravely? He must keep concealed or he will ere long be arrested.' `I do not fear. De youth is my neice.' `Thy neice?' exclaimed Dauling with a start of surprise. `Yes.' `Disguised as a banker's clerk?' `As you hut now beheld her.' `I should never have suspected her sex. When she throws off this disguise, she then is safe from suspicion, however close may be the search.' `She will pe, my lort. But dere ish risk; de risk vas ven she vas in te pank. Den if tey haf suspect and arrest her, she would have lost her life.' `That is, unless she informed who sent her.' `Which she never would haf done. She would haf die rather than petray me.' `Would you, in such case haf let her die?' `Would you, my lort?' asked the Jew significantly. `Nay, what is the Jewess to me. She is thy blood!' `She is much to thee, my lort!' `How? You speak in an enigma!' `For your sake she took upon herself all this perilous risk!' `For my sake?' `Yes, my lort. The maiden has beheld thee with eyes of favor; and knowing it was for thee she offered her services.' `I am truly grateful to her,' answered Dauling looking gratified and recalling the handsome features of the Jewess. `I am honored I dare say by her regard.' `You speak with contempt, my lort. It is true she is a Jewess. But she is rich.' `Ah, that equalizes all races, and levels all distinctions. I see thy aim, Moloch. I will look more closely to thy neice when I meet her again, for by my faith, I have not, I must confess, noted her particularly.' `If you wed her, my lort, she will pe te richest dowried Isaaelitish maiden in Lonton.' Dauling eyed Moloch steadily. He wondered that, knowing his character, and his poverty, he should wish to ally his neice with him. He reflected a moment and could not but feel that the Jew had some deep scheme at the bottom. Of the Jewess he had hardly thought of in any way, for he was not a man of gallantry; and he had too much pride and too strong prejudices to think of an alliance with a Jewess, even with a rich dowry. Nevertheless he thought it best to favor the idea for the present, hoping yet to discover Moloch's true motive in wishing the alliance, and trusting in some way to be able to direct the affair to the advancement of his own interests. He then turned his attention to the more immediate business before him; and received from the money-lender the amount already agreed upon. Placing it in his money-book he took leave of the Jew, and hastened to the bank to take up the forged draft for five thousand pounds which had caused him so much anxiety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHATER V. The King. Unlike the dramatic writers, who must move constantly forward in time with his events, the novelist has the privilege of going back on time and bringing up the past to the present, like the worker at the loom, he now drops a thread which is not wanted in the part of the figure he is then forming; but soon he goes back and takes it up to weave into the next design, and so on till all parts of his pattern are complete. Availing ourselves of this privilege, we shall, before proceeding onward any further in the direct line of occurrences, retrace our path a few hours to about the time on the evening previous, that this story opened with Dauling on his way from the yacht, to visit Moloch in the Jew's quarter in Monmouth street. The scene to which we introduce the reader is in an apartment in St. James' Palace. It was a room which the king used both as a library and private audience chamber. It was hung with tapestry three centuries old, yet the colors were still brilliant and rich. A few antiquated and massive pieces of furniture of the Elizabethan age, stood around the walls, and on one side was a tall gothic book-case of jet black oak. A large square table stood near it covered with books, maps and writing materials, with a guzette or two in French and German. Upon this table stood a tall silver candle-stand with seven branches of stag's antlers capped with silver branching from it, a chased silver socket at the extremity of each horn. In each socket burned a lofty wax-candle, the whole presenting to the eye a magnificent candelebra well becoming a royal palace. The chamber was otherwise very plainly furnished; two or three portraits of the king's German ancestors hung above the fire-place; and a jewel-hilted dress-sword lay across the mantle upon a plain chapeau distinguished only by a sample cockade of black silk. By a large velvet covered arm-chair with a high carved back surmounted by a small bronzed crown stood a man large in bulk, and something inclined to corpulency, with a heavy countenance and fleshy chin: yet, withal, with a clear, lively blue eye, and an agreeable expression of kindness and suavity about his mouth, which was very finely shaped. His stature was commanding and his air of dignity and power, at once proclaimed him a monarch. It was George III. He was dressed in a violet colored velvet coat much worn at the cuffs and soiled about the collar, with the lace torn off in front; for he had when deeply thinking, a habit, of pulling at it with his fingers, which he was now doing with great perseverance. His head was divested of the silver-powdered wig, which he was accustomed to wear, and being slightly bald, exhibited finely developed outlines of benevolence and firmness; though these attributes of character were, as the phrenologist would speak, much qualified in his acts by a deficiency of conscientiousness and a large share of combativeness. The king had been seated but a moment before, but had risen to walk the room, and after a few turns paused by his chair and stood there as we have described him. His eyes were fixed upon a person opposite to him, who had also risen when he saw the king do so, and who now stood, as waiting the decision of his majesty. This person was tall and spare, with a dark full eye and a countenance full of intelligence and feelin. His person was strikingly handsome and his air imposing. He was about fifty six years of age but had the appearance of being under forty five. There was in his address an unstudied elegance and quiet dignity, a pleasing union of graceful ease with boldness and courage, of decision with mildness, that could not fail to prepossess in his favor the most indifferent observer. He was attired in a plain suit of black velvet, and was booted and spurred. This person was the Duke of — the father of Tudor Dauling, and a near relative to the king. `I am at loss, your grace,' at length said his majesty without looking up, speaking slowly and as if still deeply meditating, `I am at a loss how to proceed in this matter you urge upon me! My love for you, cousin, would prompt me to do you this service. But I would some other way could be devised.' `I can think of no other, your majesty. The expedient I have suggested is the only one I can think of. Tudor must have an end put to his course at once or he will make himself amendable (as he already is) to the law of the land, and then, beyond even the reach of your majesty, he will die a felon's death at the hand of the hangman! Although he is but an illigimate son, he is my son, and my only son; and much as he has tried my love and patience I am still attached to him, and it would deeply grieve me that this affair should come to light. The blood which flows in my veins and also in your majesty's, flows in the veins of this unhappy young man! Your majesty, I know would not wish all England to ring with the infamy that a near relative of her king was dragged from Newgate to the gallows and there suffered death for forgery.' `Of this forgery you are quite confident,' inquired or rather remarked the the king sadly. `Yes, your majesty. I was this day at my banker's to make my semi-yearly settlement with them, when to my surprise I found there a draft dated at Portsmouth, thirty days ago, for five thousand pounds, drawn by Tudor in his own name and bearing on its face my forged acceptance. He had got it discounted in Portsmouth and the broker there had forwarded it to my bankers for collection. It had lain with them unsuspected. Confounded and grieved as I was at this discovery, I forebore to express my astonishment, and without a word paid the draft and took it into my possession. Here it is your majesty.' `It is skilfully done,' responded the king, sitting down and examining closely the forgery. `I approve of the course your grace took in not denouncing it as a forgery to your bankers.' `But to make a beneficial use of my forbearance, your majesty, it is needful that very positive steps should be immediately taken to protect both Tudor and myself against a like occurrence! This may not be the only draft! He must be checked at once in his career of guilt.' `If he were supplied with a sufficient income, cousin; would not this prevent a temptation like this?' `Your majesty is not ignorant of what I have, from time to time, done for this young man, if I may still call him so, who has reached his thirty fifth year! My indulgence has but given him licence for carrying out his follies! I can do no more for him! A sufficient income, your majesty? What amount can be a sufficient income for one who plays so deeply as Tudor does, and never rises a winner! No, your majesty. He must be at once arrested, ere he bring disgrace and bitterness upon me and render forever foul a near current of the royal blood.' `I perceive your view of the case, cousin. Something shall be done forthwith! Your suggestion that I have him imprisoned in the tower to save him from Newgate, to which he seems hastening, is one which it would be injudicious to carry out. The tower is the state's prison for the realm, and is as much under the control of Parliament as the king. If I should arrest Tudor and privately imprison him in the tower, it would ere long be bruited abroad that there was a prisoner mysteriously and secretly held there, and I should have to yield to the public voice and declare who he was.' `I see the position, your majesty, in which such a course would necessarily place you.' `He is your son and in your hands you, also, hold the evidences of a crime that would bring hun to the gallows! Arrest him privately. Convey him to your castle in the north, and there detain him a prisoner so long as you will. Perhaps you could soon conquer him and suffer him to go free, holding over his path ever the evidences of his crime, for which, assuring him on the first act of his, unbecoming his birth and blood, you would deliver him up to the laws he has offended.' `Your majesty knows the peculiar character of this young man! If I could, for a time, detain him prisoner without bringing about my castle spies and whispers of public curiosity, yet whenever I should release him, and holding above his head this forged draft show him the power I hold over his future course; he would laugh at me, knowing well and truly, your majesty, that I would never dare bring him to justice.' `He deserves to be brought to justice this day,' said the king in a tone of displeasure. `Let the laws have him, your grace.' `Your majesty forgets the considerations I have already urged against this step—much as his conduct merits such a decisive course. Tudor is very much beloved by me, still. He is nearer to my heart tkan I dare confess to myself. He is the child of a lovely woman who gave me her maiden love and all her heart'a treasures. I was then a young man at Oxford. She was of good birth, your majesty, and her ancestors hold fame and name in history as brave knights and wise statesmen. But she was poor and a widow's only child. She loved me ere she knew my rank, and I adored her with all the ardor of my soul. Two years of exquisite happiness I passed in the stolen society of this lovely and virtuous woman—for your majesty I made her my wife, marrying her under the assumed name by which only she knew me. I deceived her; but thank God she never knew it to the hour of her death, which took place a few months after the birth of her boy! But, alas! she knows it all now! continued the Duke looking upward sadly, `and her pure spirit is gazing down from the skies gently reproving me for my guilt! Can I then desert her child? Can I surrender him to an ignominious death?' `I sympathise with your affliction, cousin,' said the King with emotion.— `Doubtless this sorrow that now comes upon you, is the Providential judgment which in this life always follows wrong-doing.' `If the affliction Tudor has caused me is sent upon me for the injury done his mother, then have I been punished indeed, your Majesty. Unworthy as his conduct has been, so long as I can see in his features the beloved lineaments of her I loved but to injure, so long my heart will yearn towards him, however severely I may treat him outwardly. Scarce has my sweet daughter, now in her tenth year, with all the graces of person and mind she possesses, with all her gentle affection and innocence, scarce has she the hold upon my heart which he retains.' The king remained silent and began vigorously to pull at the torn lace on his coat. His brow was bent, his eyes fixed upon the floor, and his mouth firmly compressed. The Duke watched his countenance with deep anxiety.— At length his Majesty raised his eyes and his countenance cleared up all at once: `Cousin, I have it cow, I think. The yacht which he commands is now at the Tower, where she was ordered by the Queen to wait for her to embark on an excursion to the mouth of the Thames and so up the land a few leagues to Morley Castle. The indisposition of one of the little ones has delayed the contemplated expedition; and the Queen told me an hour since she would give it up altogether, as it was already so long deferred. Now the yacht, therefore, is unemployed. Tudor is on board!—' `Unless, your Majesty, he be on shore at some of the gaming saloons.' `He can easily be found. I will at once prepare an order under my private seal to be despatched to him by a special messenger, with direction for him to get underweigh at dawn, and lay to off the Tower to take on board a states-prisoner.' `And who is this prisoner of state, your Majerty, and how is it to carry out my views with regard to Tudor?' asked the Duke perplexed. `The prisoner of state is to be none other than the captain of the yacht himself,' said the King smiling. `I do not comprehend your Majesty.' `I will explain, cousin. When he lays off the Tower, a boat containing seven persons shall come off to him and they shall get on board. One of them shall be masked. He shall be yourself. The others shall be four stout menat-arms of tried courage, and the other two officers of the Police disgnised as king's messengers! Tudor shall be instructed to give you the liberty of the deck, and leave you to the four men-at-arms. In my order I will instruct him to proceed to the mouth of the Thames where the frigate Serapis is at anchor awaiting my despatches for America, and after anchoring near her open the private despatch which the chief of the police will retain for him, by my command till then. That despatch will show hun who is the true prisoner of state, and when he has read it through, reveal yourself to him and who your companions are. You can then dictate to him your own terms. Shew him that the Head of the Police, who alone we must take into our confidence, has a warrant for his arrest as a forger, and that it will at once be served upon him. Give him the alternative to sail away from England in the yacht (which I give him) and carve out a name and fortune in distant lands, or to be taken back to London in the custody of the Bow street officer as a common felon.— If he attempts resistance show him the frigate, the captain of which will be instructed to obey your slightest signal, and assure him he and his yacht are entirely within your power. This is an unusual plan of proceeding, but, your grace, under the circumstances, I cannot well devise any other. The succes of it, I think, is sure. His pride of character will lead him to adopt the least disagreeable alternative, and as I state in my despatch to him that his return to England or its waters without permission will be the signal of his arrest as a common forger!' When the King had done speaking, the nobleman, who had listened at first, with incredulous surprise and then, as his majesty proceeded, developing his plan, with the closest and most interested attention, became thoughtful as if deeply meditating upon the king's project. His majesty watched him closely and with an expression of anxiety. `Your majesty, he at length said, `has manifested in this affair the kindest interest, for which I know not how to be sufficiently grateful. The plan you have suggested, at the sacrifice of your yacht, and at the expense of so much trouble in person, seems to me, on the whole, our only alternative. It is attended with some difficulties, but I confess to your majesty, my cheerful cooperation! But whither shall he go? Whereve he wanders he carries a fond father's heart with him. It will be hard to give him up forever, perhaps to pursue a course of crime and bloodshed!' `Either he or yourself, my lord Duke, must be sacrificed,' said the King firmly. `If he remains in England he will involve you, perhaps, irrevocably, when he knows you will not prosecute. It is better he should be exiled, and I trust your grace will feel the expediency of it.' `It shall be done, as your majesty commands!' `I do not command, cousin; I do but advise.' `Your wishes are to me as commands. I require your command or else, I am satisfied, I should let my weakness betray me in my stern duty!' `Be it my command then, cousin,' said the King pleasantly. Will you touch that bell for my private secretary. The despatches shall at once be made up. The secretary need know nothing, as I will fill up with names, etc., in my own hand!' `Your Majesty is most kind.' `You are too valuable a friend, and I esteem you too highly, my lord duke. for me to suffer your happiness to be thus daily ventured by this reckless son of yours, to call him by no worse epithet. Moreover, unless he be compelled to leave our realm he will ere long be interfering, ten to one, with the happiness of the young lady Mary, your daughter, whom, I have heard say, he loves not too well for occupying his place as the inheritor of your name and dukedom!' `Have you heard such things of him?' cried the Duke, becoming very pale. `Truly have I, cousin; and yet by your looks it seems news to you!' `It is news, indeed!' answered the Duke faintly. `Have you never seen ought of this ill-will manifested in him?' `No, your majesty. On the contrary, Tudor has always shown the most fraternal love for his sister. I never suspected but that he loved her with sincerity and tenderness!' `It may all be a skillfully worn cloak to deceive your grace,' observed his majesty impressively. `Does the child regard him with attachment?' `The most devoted and faithful! She has of late seen him but seldom, but never does a day pass but she names her brother Tudor with affectionate language. If he is hypocritical only in his love for his sister, would not her pure love discover the disguise by instinct, and take alarm at once?' `Perhaps not, my lord duke, perhaps not,' responded the king with a shake of the head. `But what motive could he have?' `That I cannot answer. One thing is very clear, that it would not be natural for Tudor to love sincerely his sister under their mutual relations to each other—she your legitimate child and heiress, he an outcast without other name than that which you assumed and under which you became the husband to his mother. On the contrary he has every thing to make him hate her, and every thing to make him just the reckless man he is! He feels that he has a right to avenge himself upon you, for the wrong you have done him; and, I fear, that this vengeance he will not be satisfied in limiting merely to extracting money from you.' `What does your majesty mean?' demanded the duke alarmed by this mysterious yet significant language. `I mean that he may be tempted to pierce your heart through your daughter.' `Your majesty cannot mean—' gasped the Duke—but he could speak no farther, and stood gazing upon the king with the most painful anxiety, his lips parted, his eyes fixed and wild. `I do but surmise, your grace. I know nothing sure. Recover from your alarm. If Tudor is at once aken care of as I have suggested, there need be no apprehensions.' `I thank your majesty for this hint. Your majesty is wise and clear-sighted! I will not delay in taking this course you have pointed out. I shall feel insecure while he remains on British ground. If he perish in far lands he must perish! My child must not become the victim of his disappointed ambition—of his filial vengeance.' He then took up the little silver bell to which the king had before drawn his attention and rung it. In a moment afterwards the door opened and a slender, gray-headed man wearing a long silk gown, and his head buried in a huge red woolen cap shuffled into their presence. A pen was stuck behind his ear and the second finger of his right hand was blackened with ink. He was the secretary. After a busy half-hour the necessary documents were executed, and that directed to the captain of the yacht was immediately despatched by a king's messenger. Its arrival on board and the events which followed are already known to the reader. The remaining papers were given by the king into the Duke's possession, and in a little while afterwards he took leave of his majesty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. The Jewess. On reaching the banking-house, Tudor Dauling leaped from the cab in which he had rapidly been driven there, and entering the vestibule, drew from his pocket-book as he passed in, the notes with which he was to take up the forged paper. With a feeling of relief and satisfaction, he approached the desk of the cashier with the five thousand pounds in his hand. His air was confident and his manner easy and self-possessed, for he felt he had now his reputation in his own hands once more. `Your House holds a draft, I believe, against the Duke of —,' he said addressing the banker, and displaying the money upon the desk. `Do you speak of a draft dated at Portsmouth for five thousand pounds?' asked the gentleman. `Yes.' `The Duke himself paid it yesterday.' `The Duke?—paid? How do you mean, sir?' demanded Tudor with surprise, hardly sure that he had rightly understood him. `His Grace settled yesterday, and although the draft did not mature till today, he preferred taking it up.' `Are you positive that it was a draft drawn from Portsmouth?' `Yes, sir! Drawn thirty days since by yourself, if, as I believe this is Captain Dauling!' `Oh—ah—very right—very well!' he stammered, now convinced that his father had really paid the forged paper. He at once divined his motive in taking it up, and remaining silent as to its true character. `Yes, yes. The Duke then took it up himself. He told me day before yesterday as I was coming up to London, I might call and pay it. But I perceive he has anticipated me by coming up himself. Good morning, sir!' The banker bowed respectfully and Dauling quitted the place and threw himself into his cab. `Vere shall I drive, sir?' asked the cabman. He was silent a moment reflecting how to answer this question. His mind was in a state of alarm and confusion at the startling discovery he had just made, that his forgery was not only known to the Duke, but that he held in his possession the forged testimony of his crime. In this perplexity he thought of his yacht, and a vague idea suggested itself to him, of escaping in her instantly from England; but at the same moment he reflected upon her crippled condition, and bitterly condemned his folly in placing her in this condition; for he felt convinced, the more he thought upon his act, that the Duke would not have paid the five thousand pounds without some deep motive—deeper than the fear of his exposure. `Drive to Monmouth street,' he said abruptly, for he could think of no other person than Moloch to advise with in this extremity. `Vere I tooks yer honor up?' `Yes—drive at full speed.' `Yes, yer honor—double fare though.' `Trible—only spare not your whip.' He found Moloch in the room where he had his first interview with him. The Jew looked up with surprise at his sudden entrance, for he had passed through the shop, ascended the dark stair-way, and entered the chamber unannounced. `Well, Moloch, the devil has me at vantage this time,' he said, throwing himself upon one of the velvet chairs that graced the money-lender's private room. `Vat ish it now, mi lort? Haf you forgot te right day and ish it too late to take him up?' `No. To-day is the day it was due. But what do you think?' `Vell, my lort, vat ish it?' asked Moloch with a look of curiosity. `The Duke—my father—has been before me!' `How, mi lort?' `It seems, as my luck would have it, that yesterday was the Duke's setting day. So he goes to the Bank for this purpose, and of course this draft was spoken of as due to day. At any rate he found out that the Bank had such a draft. Now what do you think he did?' `Had a Bow shreet officer to lay in vait vhen you come to pay it and take you.' `No—worse than that.' `He, perhaps, told te pank it vos forge and te pank arrest you ant you escape and come here—for you look as if you haf been in fright, my lort.' `It was worse than this. The Duke quietly paid the draft, said nothing about it being a forgery, so far as I could discover by the cashier's manner, and took the accursed paper into his possession. There he has it and me, also, as you perceive in his power! Now what is to be done?' The Jew remained silent and seemed to be deeply meditating upon what he had heard. There was, at the same time, perceptibly lurking in his dark Syrian eyes a look of inward satisfaction—as if he was well pleased in his heart at this turn of affairs. `When dit te Duke pay dis monies?' he asked without raising his eyes, which were fixed thoughtfully upon the carpet. Yesterday.—He has had, since then, the damning proof of my guilt in his hands. What use he has made or intends to make of it I dare not contemplate. I am fully in his power. If my schooner was in a condition to sail, I should be tempted at once to fly the country. Each moment I may be arrested as a forger and thrown into Newgate!' Dauling, as he spoke, rose and walked the room with a flushed brow and an agitated step. `Tish a pad affair, my lort.' `I must get possession of that draft. I am not safe a moment while it is in my father's hands. He may see fit to arrest me upon it, and then behold me swinging on a hangman's gallows! Good God! this idea is horrible. Moloch you must aid me. You must help me to get possession of this forged paper!' `Tish a fery pad affair, my lort, inteed,' repeated Moloch with a shake of the head; `fery pad.' `You need not aggravate me by repeating that. I know it is bad—bad enough. Use your wits and help me with some advice. If you want money you shall have it.” `Vere ish te Duke now?' asked Moloch raising his eyes a moment to the haggard visage of the forger. `He must be at his house in Regent street if he is still in London. I dare not go there! You, Moloch, must in some way manage to get this proof of my crime.' The money-lender's eyes sparkled. A singular expression passed slowly across his countenance and then vanished, leaving his face perfectly calm and serene, which was its natural aspect. Dauling stopped before him and eagerly surveyed his face as if trying to read there his mind. `Sit down, mi lort, ant ve vill talk it ofer! Now vot vill your lortship gift me if I get 'tis forge paper from te Duke's hants?' `Money—yes! Money is your only god!' said Dauling contemptuously. `I will give you one thousand pounds!' `My lort, one tousant pounts ish little monies to pay for your reputation and safety!' `Name then your wages!' answered Dauling indignantly. `Your lortship vos to-day ready to pay fife tousant pounts for te draft!' `Human leech! take the five thousand pounds then! I will give it you if you will possess yourself of that paper!' `It will be a difficult matter, my lort! Do you think the Duke would give it to Moloch the Jew?' he asked scornfully. `You must devise means. Your race are never at a loss for artifices in extremities where gold is to be won!' `I must haf one to aid me, my lort! There is one who has a ready wit, who may be willing to serve us! You have already seen her tact!' `Your daughter?' `My NEICE, she is my lort!' `Your neice, then. How can she effect this for me?' `I will insure your lortship that if she will undertake it, she vill succeed in it!' `Then entrust it to her!' said Dauling impatiently. `She must be paid too, my lort,' said Moloch quietly. `Are you not paid? reward your own assistants!' `I am paid this to place the draft in your hands. She is to be rewarded for getting it from the Duke's!' `What pay dost thou want, Jew, for thy neice's services?' `Your lortship's hand!' replied Moloch, fixing his dark, piercing gaze full or his face, and speaking in a tone of singular decision. `My hand?' `Your hand, my lort!' `Explain yourself, Jew?' demanded the ignoble nobleman wholly at a loss to comprehend the bold money-lender's meaning. The condition on which Rachel serves in this affair, my lort, is dat if successful your lortship make her your wife.' `Make a Jew's daughter my wife? Do you know what you say and who I am?' `Both one and the other, my lort.' Dauling looked at him a few seconds in silent surprise, and with a brow black with anger. The insult stung him to the soul. He saw at a glance the deep policy of the aspiring Jew; but he reflected that without his aid he was lost should the Duke make use of the power he possessed. He saw that Moloch was in earnest; and that the desire of giving his neice in alliance with a duke's son, blinded him to the stain upon his birth, and the infamy of his character. `Moloch, you jest,' he said forcing a laugh, while he felt like crushing him for his insulting suggestion. `You know I am not a marrying man. Besides your neice would gain little honor in wedding one like me.' `I fear not that. The maiden loves you, my lort, and it is my vish she should pecome your wife.' `You forget I am a Christian. Jews and Christians never unite in wedlock. `It has been done, my lort.' `What motive, have you, in pressing this strange union? What can her alliance with me profit her or you? By the rood! There is little in me to covet an illegitimate scion of royal blood.' `It is because the royal blood flows in your veins I covet this.' `I am a forger! Would you wed your neice to a forger?' `Your forgery is only known to the Duke and myself. To the world you still are a man of honor.' `I am poor, Moloch!' `I have money!' `Do you mean to say you will give a dowry with your neice?' `I promise nothing, my lort,' answered Molock coldly. `I will not sell her to you. If you choose to marry her for the service she will be to you, well.' `Is this the only alternative, Jew?' asked Dauling after a short silence. `It is, my lort. Wed her and I pledge you my word the draft you so much desire to possess, shall be in your hands within four and twenty hours.' `What shall I do with thy neice as my wife, should I consent, from force of circumstances to make her such? I have no house but my schooner? Shall I bring a Jewish wife into the cabin of the Queen's Yacht?' `Thy wife, for the present, may remain with me,' answered the Jew. The captain of the yacht stood for some minutes wrapped in gloomy meditation upon his perplexing and even dangerous position. He reflected that he made himself amenable to the outraged laws of his country by an act of forgery, the testimonials of which were in the hands of the Duke, from whom, (from this circumstance) he apprehended, he knew not what, severe manifestation of his power over him which the possession of this instrument gave him. Till he had this paper in his own hands he felt he should be in instant fear of arrest and exposure. To live in this constant lear was impossible. To purchase exemption from it by sacrificing himself to the Jews' neice he felt would be paying too dear a price. That Moloch should make this a condition astonished and perplexed him. The firmness of the Jew in insisting upon it showed him that it was his only alternative, unless he secretly went himself to the Duke's house and sought for the draft among his papers (if it were possible to steal into his dwelling unseen!) or seek out the Duke and take it from him by menacing him with death. The idea of casting himself upon his father's clemency he did not dwell upon for a moment; for he well recollected how he had repeatedly before abused it, and, as he believed, shut up his heart against him. By force, subtlety, or treachery he only expected to attain his object, and without the Jews' aid he felt he could do nothing effectually and safely. `Moloch, this is a hard condition you put upon me,' he said gloomily, `The draft must be had at all sacrifices, and had at once! for, the more I reflect upon the Duke's manner of taking it up before it was due, and paying the money without a word to the banker, eagerly grasping at the draft, as it were, to anticipate my getting possession of it, the more I am satisfied he means to make some use of it to hold me in his power. `I will wed your neice! But has she no voice?' `I will ask her.' As he spoke he rose and crossed the room to what seemed a window covered from the ceiling to the floor with drapery. Lifting this with his hand, he exposed a recess of considerable dimensions and tastefully furnished. Within it sat the Jewess Rachel at a writing desk. She looked up and smiled at the surprise of Dauling on thus discovering that his interview with the Jew had had a third party. `He gazed upon her with surprise, yet not unmixed with admiration. The lofty character of her oriental style of beauty, the Esther-like lovelines and dignity of her air, the glorious beauty of her dark Arabian eyes as they beamed on him, softly shaded by their curving fringes of long lashes, had an effect upon him he could not resist. He felt, in his heart, that were she not a Jewess, he would not be making so great a sacrifice after all his objections and arguments against the union. `There is the maiden, my lort, let her answer for herself.' Rachel rose and entered the chamber, moving with a queenly grace that was captivating and yet singularly imposing. A scarlet ribbon bound up her black locks and a spencer of bright crimson velvet displayed the superb volume of her bust. Her diminutive feet were encased in red slippers, and her small olive tinted fingers were sparkling with rubies. Such was the favorite costume of the handsome Jewess, and finely did it become her. `My lord,' she said, `I have but one will, and that is my uncle's. He has been my benefactor from infancy, and but for his care I should have perished. He commands. I obey.' `You then consent to this singular condition he proposes? For you, doubtless, have heard all that has been said, and therefore know who and what you are to wed?' `I both know who and what, my lord;' she said, repeating his words with a peculiar emphasis upon the two pronouns, which did not strike him then, but which occurred to him afterwards. `It is surprising you should be willing to sacrifice yourself.' `You are not indifferent to me, my lord. I know circumstances have made you criminal rather than evil principles. You feel yourself at feud with men of noble acknowledged birth, and hence all your errors of conduct.' `Errors of conduct! You are charitable, fair Jewess,' said Dauling with a gratified tone in his voice. `You know me better than I dared to know myself. I am, indeed less guilty,' he added with emotion, `than I seem! I was honorable in feeling and noble in principle, till, as I grew up to manhood, I learned the infamy that clung to my name! Then I little cared to keep up in fair show before the world a counterfeit as if it were genuine! I could not pass with men for what I would be and should have been, and therefore I became indifferent how I passed! You have spoken truth, Jewess. I am not by nature so depressed as I seem! For these words I thank you most kindly! You are then willing to wed me?' `Not against thy will, my lord,' said Rachel with a smile and glance that penetrated his soul. `It will be against my will, beauteous as thou art. But look ye, fair Rachel, I am to wed thee only on conditidn you succeed in obtaining this draft. If you succeed in getting it, I swear to make you my wife! But in marrying me, mark you, you gain nothing and risk everything!' `I gain thee, my lord!' she answered. `This duty enjoined upon me I will undertake and success is to be the condition of our union. I undertake it that I may save you.' `Are you then so much interested in me?' he said, taking her hand. `I desire to save you, my lord, from the danger your imprudence has placed you in. After I have possessed myself of the instrument of your guilt, is it not fair that I should possess what I am to risk so much to save?' `Be it so. Yet I warn you, noble Jewess, that I have neither house nor land, name nor honor to endorse them with! Nay, that thou must still remain an inmate of thy uncle's abode.' `That I know, my lord,' `Be it as you will then. Bring me within twenty-four hours the forged draft my father holds, and I will wed you the next moment after!' `I will try, my lord,' said the Jewess with a confidant smile. `If it can be done at all, it will be done by to-morrow ere this hour.' `Then you will see me here!' Dauling had already began to feel diminished reluctance, under all the circumstances, to take the Jewess to wife, (for she had really awakened an interest in his bosom) so long as he was not compelled to acknowledge or take her away from Moloch's dwelling; and taking leave of her and the Jew he quitted the room escorted by Moloch to the lower door. `My lort, you had pest keep close avhile till ve see vat can pe done apout the draft. If te Duke should seek you it would be pad pusiness.' `I see that, Moloeh. I know where I can be secluded enough till to-morrow. By the way your neice is not so—that is, I mean to say she is a noble woman! If she only wasn't a Jewess! But Jewess or no I will fulfil my promise on the conditions, and make her my wife if she succeeds.' `To-morrow will show,' answered Moloch as he closed the door upon him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. The Duke. At the moment that his son was quitting the tenement of the Jew, Moloch, the Duke of — was being ushered into the private audience-chamber of his majesty. The king had just dismissed his prime-minister and was alone walking up and down, his feet shod in red cloth slippers, an old brocade dressing gown hanging back from his shoulders and a cup of coffee in his hand, this being his favourite beverage which he always imbibed, walking slowly to and fro the apartment, and talking as he sipped and walked, if he had any one present. `Ah, cousin, how is this?' he said, stopping and regarding him with surprise. `I thought by this time you were well underweigh down the Thames! How is it I see you so soon again? Have you given up the project?' `Your majesty, I was prepared with my party and disguises at sun-rise this morning, and waiting in the Tower for the yacht to come to take us on board.' `And has the scapegrace run away with it?' `No, your majesty, on the contrary, he shortly brought the yacht into the Tower dock, but a wreck! She had been run into during the night by a coal barge which had drifted from her moorings, and her bowsprit with all its rigging was carried away!' `This is most unfortunate. How long will it take to repair her?' `I gave orders at once in your majesty's name to Sir John who commands the Tower, to have her repairs expedited with all celerity; and he told me that by to-night's ebb tide she could be made ready. This will be at seven o'clock!' `This is better. You will then go on board and proceed with your plan of conduct as already arranged. Did you see Tudor?' `No, your majesty. After landing he went into the city. Sir John informed me that he had left orders for his own crew to make the repairs, and by no means suffer the dock workmen to interfere.' `This was a singular order!' `It is my impression, your majesty, that this `accident' was no accident, but an intentional thing on the part of Tudor. Sir John informed me that he had despatched a barge from the Tower to board the coal-lugger to reprimand them for their carelessness, when the skipper assured him that the cable had been slipbed by some one who had got on board unseen, and whom he saw leap from the bows into the yacht when they came in contact. The man said, as far as he could tell in the night, this person was a youth and wore an officer's button!' `This is very extraordinary. Can you give any reason for Tudor's sending any one on such a business?' asked the king, setting down his emptied cup, and refilling it with his own hand from a small silver coffee-pot that stood by him. `The order to sail this morning, if obeyed, would have prevented him from going to the bank to take up his draft, which, without doubt, he intended to meet by some means; in this state of the case he might have brought the coal barge down upon his vessel to have an excuse for remaining until he could pay this forged paper, which must have been the uppermost thought in his mind. The statement of the master of the coal vessel is very positive, and although Sir John was disposed to question its accuracy and to regard it only as an excuse, I was at once inclined to give it credence; for such an act is precisely characteristic of Tudor!' `It is very possible,' said the king, adding a fourth lump of sugar to his fragrant Mocha. `The sooner Tudor is out of the kingdom the better!' `I think so, your majesty. By evening we shall be ready to embark!' `But can he be found?' `If your majesty will have such instructions conveyed to him to be delivered on his first appearance on board, commanding him to prepare to leave with the tide, and forbidding him quitting the yacht again, there is no doubt but that we can carry out our object!' `I will do this, your grace. Ah, Retsch,' said the king, speaking to his German secretary who that moment entered, `What do you bring?' `A letter, your majesty!' `It is from this very captain of our Queen's yacht,' exclaimed the king, on opening it. `Hark you, cousin, hear what he sayeth; Queen's Yacht, Tower-Dock, 7 A. M. `May it please your majesty, it is with regret I have to inform your majesty that in consequence of an accident which last night occurred to the yacht by the carelessness of a coal-barge skipper, whereby my bowsprit was carried away and other damage done which it will take three or four days to repair, it is out of my power to render obedience to your majesty's commands last night received. I await your majesty's further pleasure. I am your majesty's very humble servant and subject, TUDOR DAULING, Commander of the Queen's Yacht. `Now what think you of this, cousin?' demanded the king after laying down the letter, and taking very deliberately a sip of coffee, `what think you of this? It seems to me we are doing Tudor injustice.' `Possibly, your majesty. But this note confirms my opinion.' `In what respect?' `He says that the damage will need three or four days work to repair it, when Sir John says the yacht shall be ready by sundown! It is plain he wants to delay, and has some deep motive for it!' `If it was only to meet the draft. to-day will have been all the time he required. I must look upon this as an accident as he represents it. I can't believe he would endanger the yacht from any selfish motives!' `I will not press the point; I would rather much I were in the wrong than your majesty. The delay of the yacht will change things materially. If Tudor now goes to the bank he will there discover that I have taken up the draft, and this knowledge will have upon his acts some kind of effect. It will turn his thoughts towards me, and lead to erroneous suspicions concerning my motive; and, that he will not quit London leaving in my possession the proof of his guilt, I am convinced.' `The only way, then, is to see that when he returns to his yacht, as he will sometime to-day, to have Sir John instructed to convey to him my commands that he remain and superintend the repairs, and not leave it again. Sir John shall see, if need be, that he cannot,' concluded his majesty. `I have some duties to attend to at my house, and I wish to ascertain if he has been to the bank; therefore I will now take my leave of your majesty. When next I see you, cousin, I hope it will be with the news on your lips that this scapegrace who gives us so much trouble is well over the sea!' Tudor, on leaving the Jew's habitation, took his way in a direction that brought him to Ludgate street, ascending which and passing St. Paul's, he stopped before a palace-like edifice situated a little retired from the street Is was one of the club-house of London, connected with which in the extensive chambers abovestairs, were suites of gaming-rooms, furnished with great elegance and luxury. He entered the club-room with the air of one at home, and equal of those who thronged it. He nodded familiarly to several noblemen and was recognized by a similar gesture; for although the bend sinister marred his shield, his blood and well known paternal lineage gave him admittance and a certain consideration among the titled aristocracy. His position in society was not, however, precisely what it would have been had there been no cloud upon his birth, In more than one way his sensitiveness had been wounded; and although others did not shun him for his want of name and family, he felt a sense of degradation which embittered his spirit, and made him reckless of character and of consequences. It was this morbid feeling which drove him for relief to the gaming-table, as parallel states of mind drove others to the wine-cup. In the excitement of play he lost the sense of his equivocal position among men of honor; and whether he lost or won, the oblivion of thought which play brought with it, was in itself a sufficient recompense to his spirits. We shall not follow him into the upper-rooms of the stately edifice into which he entered. In four hours afterwards he left it without a guinea of the large sum he had in his pocket-book when he entered. Silent and moody he took his way towards the Tower for the purpose of going on board his vessel; but in a little while he reflected that the Duke might be there awaiting him to arrest him; for, save for the purpose of getting him into his power, he could not imagine why he should so quietly have taken up the draft. He, therefore, turned aside and entering a low inn resolved to remain in private there until the next day when he hoped by going to the Jews' to learn the success of Rachel. Here he remained an hour or two in a restless state of mind, when as he glanced into the tap-room, he saw several coachmen's coats and other garments hanging on pegs around the wall. The idea immediately occurred to him to disguise himself, and under this protection for his person visit the dock and see if there was any appearance of the Duke's emissaries in wait for him. The habit he made choice of was that of a countryman, consisting of a long frock, thick boots, a broad-brimmed white hat, and gloves and whip to match. The landlord loaned them to him taking in pledge his own suit. In this disguise he sallied forth, and reaching the Tower gate, found he was debarred. Satisfied from this that his disguise was perfect, he called a waterman and getting into his skiff asked to be pulled along the water-side of the Tower. He soon came near his yacht, which, to his surprise, he found in the hands of the dock-men, and her damages nearly repaired. Confounded at this celerity, for he had given orders to his first officer to be leisurely, as there was no haste, he saw that it was expedient for him to act with decision. That the king had ordered this despatch he had no question; and as he saw on examination of what had been done, that by the close of day his vessel would be in readiness for sea, when doubtless he would have to sail with his states' prisoner, he began to deliberate what step to take. The morrow would show him whether the draft would be recovered; and if so, he was then fearless and free again. To leave before he had got this out of the Duke's hand, he felt was out of the question. `I will see the duke myself!' he said suddenly. This disguise will aid me. I will seek him and forthwith, too. Fortune may favor me, and if I succeed I am free from bondage to the fair Jewess! To go to the Duke's palace will be placing my head in the lion's mouth if he should detect me. But I must act with firmness and without delay; for I cannot exist with a forged draft of five thousand pounds held over my head each instant by the hand of the man whom I have reason to fear as my greatest enemy, though, God knows, he has been mine in refusing me his name which is my right in nature. Pull for the shore. Give way and land me at the first stairs.' The waterman looked surprised at this sudden and commanding order from one whom he supposed a common peasant; but, without speaking a word in reply he bent to his oars to which not a little alarm gave a new impetus. We will now change the scene of our story to the interior of the town mansion or Palace of the Duke of —. It is an hour before sundown. The Duke has just retired from the dining room to his library where he is seated writing a letter. It is addressed, `To His most gracious majesty, Sire, I shall depart in one hour for the Tower and go on board, or rather, be taken, en masque as the prisoner of state, on board the yacht with my party of Police-men! Sir John informs me that the repairs are already completed, and that the schooner will be ready to sail, down the river with the first turn of the tide. Then getting Tudor to anchor under the guns of the frigate at the mouth, we can dictate our own terms to him!— Tudor has not yet been on board; but I have ascertained that he made his appearance at the Bank at noon and called for the draft holding the amount in notes in his open pocket-book. The cashier who suspects nothing, voluntarily informed me as I entered the banking-house, that he had come to take up the draft, not knowing that it was paid already. `When I told him that your grace had taken it up in person,' said the banker to me, `he said that it was all very well; that you had given him the funds to take it up, as he was coming into town, not expecting to be in London yourself!' `You see here my liege, Tudor's self-possession and readiness of invention; for he must, undoubtedly have been taken by surprise on finding the draft in my possession, yet he seems to have manifested none; at least nothing to attract the attention of the banker or rouse his suspicions. Since then I am ignorant of Tudor's movements. Once get him on board and down the river, and I think he will rather set sail for distant lands, than return a prisoner in the hands of Bow-street officers. Should he not appear at the Dock this evening, I shall promptly advise your majesty. I am your majesty's very humble servant and cousin, Edward. The Duke had just completed this epistle, and was about folding it, when an attendant announced a gentleman who desired to see His grace on very urgent business. With his thoughts running upon his son the Duke instantly desired him to be shown into his presence. `Now, perhaps some message concerning Tudor!' he said looking eagerly towards the door. `Yet what reason have I to look for any?' The door was thrown open by the footman, and the Duke beheld enter a young man, scarce twenty-one with a foreign style of face, but an air decidedly noble and high bred. The youth on seeing the Duke bowed with respectful courtesy, uncovering his head, and then standing silent before him. `Pray sir, what have you to communicate? Be seated, sir,' said the Duke who did not remember ever having seen this very handsome face before. The young man glanced around the room as if to be sure that he was alone, and then said `What I have to communicate to your highness, perhaps should not have a third party as a listener.' `We are quite alone. Proceed, sir,' said the Duke with anxious expectation of he knew not what, yet which he believed would have reference to Tudor.' `Your Grace has a son, I believe?' The Duke started at this abrupt inquiry; but immediately composed himself and answered sadly, `Yes, unfortunately.' `He is a source of unhappiness to your grace?' `You but tell me what all men should know! What know you new of him?' `I will tell your grace.' `First tell me, if you will do me the favor, whom I address?' `I am the son, your grace, of a rich Jewish merchant of London!' `A Jew! What do you here? What hast thou in common with my son?' `Much, your grace!' `Then say on. Out with it! It is some affair of money, I warrant me. But if he has had money of thy father, and has not paid it, come not to me with the tale. I have had enough of them. `Yet it concerns his honor and thine, for your grace to know it!' `Then out with it! I have heard much evil and can listen to more. Thy business with me? Be prompt for time presses!' `The career of your grace's son, Tudor Dauling, is known to me and my father fully. My father has advanced him monies from time to time!' `Who is thy father and was he ever repaid?' demanded the Duke abruptly. `My father is a Jewish merchant, his name I may not give. He has been paid, your grace, save in one instance. It is as follows:—My father advanced him the money upon a draft for six thousand pounds. The draft was drawn upon your grace and accepted by you. It was due before the close of banking hours to-day, and should have been taken up by him instead of being presented to your grace: this being the understanding. But as the time has passed by two hours, my father has sent me with the draft to your grace, and I now have the honor of presenting it for payment.' The Duke listened, overcome with grief and confusion. Here then was a second forgery close upon the heels of the first. His first indignant impulse was to pronounce it a forgery, but he controlled his feelings with a great effort! `Let me see the draft?' The young man presented it to him. He looked over it and saw that it was the counterpart of the one he held for five thousand pounds. He sighed deeply and remained some moments in troubled thought, deliberating whether he had not best at once to declare it forged and let justice take its course. But parental feeling-the memory of his son's dead and wronged mother prevailed. `I hope it is all right, your grace,' said the young man eying him very closely. `Yes—yes,' answered the Duke recovering himself; `quite right! I was thinking if I had sufficient funds at command. Due to day! So it is I see by the date! Can you call to-morrow.' `Does your grace intend to pay it?' demanded the young Jew severely. `No, sir,' responded the Duke acting from the angry impulse of the moment. `It is a forgery; sir; and thus I destroy the proofs of my son's guilt.' As he spoke he tore the draft in pieces and cast them at his feet. To his surprise the young man remained perfectly calm, and his countenance as unmoved as if nothing had occurred. The Duke surveyed his handsome and singularly serene face a few seconds in silence and wonder. `You are not surprised?' `No, your grace. I knew that it was a forgery when I brought it.' `Then what kept you from arresting the author of it?' asked the Duke trembling lest it had been done. `That I might, if possible, induce your grace to pay it and save him.' `This was humane and considerate in your father,' answered the Duke. `We knew you were attached to your son, and that any public exposure would be likely to grieve you; and that you would pay the amount before you would see him in Newgate! We could prosecute still, but do not desire to do so, unless encouraged by your grace!' `I have no desire to prosecute him?' `Then why does your grace hold in your possession a similar forged draft for five thousand pounds?' `How did you learn this?' demanded the Duke, rising from his chair and advancing a step towards him with a look of astonishment and alarm. `From his own mouth. In a word, your grace, the truth is as follows: Your son acknowledged the draft just destroyed to be a forgery and that he could not pay it. My father threatened to arrest him. They spoke aside together then, for some time, and he told my father of the draft you held; and finally by some arrangements between them, to which I am not a party, it was decided by my father (on what considerations I am not at liberty to devulge) that if you would surrender the forged draft you hold he would not prosecute.' `And you have come for this paper?' `I have, your grace.' `This is a very extraordinary arrangement! What can your father want of it?' `It is your son who wishes to get it into his own hands again, my lord! It is the only forged paper out that involves himself, and he cannot rest until it is in his possession.'</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. The Two Visitors. The Duke heard this revelation with astonishment. The boldness and singular character of such a procedure confounded him. He, however, governed his feelings and said— `Then you have seen him to-day?' `I have, my lord!' `Where?' `At my father's!' `Whose name you are pleased to withhold!' said the Duke, sarcastically. `For the present, your grace.' `I am to understand, then, that if I surrender the forged draft I now hold, that your father will decline prosecuting my son for the forgery palmed upon him?' `Such is the condition, my lord!' `And a very singular one! What can be the nature of the compact entered into by this misguided man with your father? But that too, you say you are not at liberty to divulge!' remarked the Duke in the same sarcastic tone. `This Jew, your father is a worthy man, indeed, to enter into a compact to protect a forger!' `That forger is your lordship's son!' `True—I had not thought of that! He is my son and more's the pity! But for the life of me I cant see what bribe this draft can be to your father to induce him not only quietly to suffer the loss of the six thousand pounds which I have refused to pay, but also to refuse to prosecute! You seem to be a person of intelligence and judgment far above your condition. I am willing to leave this unpleasant matter in your hands and on your terms. But what pledge will you give me that you will not prosecute your claim even if I surrender to you for my son this forged paper? The whole affair is a riddle to me!' `I am willing to deposit with your grace the full amount of the draft, and am ready to forfeit this sum if we prosecute!' `You are willing and ready to do this?' demanded the Duke with a look of wonder. `I am, my lord,' answered the young man, taking a note book from his pocket and displaying on the table before his grace, five Bank of England notes for one thousand pounds each. `You are a very extraordinary person. There must be some strange and mysterious link of union between my poor son and your father to have such things done in his behalf!' The color rose quickly into the face of the youth at this remark, but after letting fall the heavily fringed lids of his dark oriental eyes a moment to the floor, he recovered the self-possession which had characterised his manner throughout this interview. `There is a bond of union, your grace, which you shall by and by learn. Shall I have the notes, my lord?' he said, litting his finger from the pile, and leaving them before the Duke. `You mean, will I surrender the forged note?' `I do, my lord!' `I will, on the condition that you promise never to mention this unhappy crime to human ears. Censurable as the conduct of my son has been, I have still great love for him and much charity; for I cannot but feel conscious that I have done him more wrong than any other man living; for he is my child, and yet I refuse him my name! He has told me to my face that I must thank myself for all his conduct! and I assure you, I do severely blame myself. Were he a legitimate son, I should have borne with him far less than I do. I am an unhappy man!' The Duke spoke with deep emotion in his voice, and for a few moments leant his forehead in his hand and covered his eyes. `I sympathise with you, my lord!' `Thanks. But, the more I hear you speak, the more I feel convinced that you were not educated as the son of a mere Jewish merchant. Your air, language, tone of voice, are cultivated and refined in an unusual degree!' Here the Duke abruptly addressed a question in French to him. The young man responded to it in the same language and in the purest idiom. The Duke then put an inquiry in Italian, which was responded to in the same tongue and with remarkable eloquence of expression. `You are not a mere Jew's son—nor yet a Jew!' said the Duke with surprise, and fixing upon him the closest scrutiny. `There is a mystery in all this matter with you as well as with the rest!' `I am but the child of an Israelite, my lord. My father's wealth has been devoted to my education and thus the superiority you are pleased to flatter me with, is easily explained. Shall I have the notes?' `No. Take them! Here is the draft. Take it to my son and tell him that—nay, say nothing to him from me! Yes—if you have any influence over him, urge him to return at once to his yacht, as the King has pressing duty for him. Urge him to this but not from me. So he is with your father?' `Not now, my lord. He left not long before I did. But he will call to know my success!' `Poor Tudor! I did intend with this draft to win him back to virtue and honor. I did intend to hold it over him as a means of keeping him within the bounds of integrity! But take it, and tell him—nay, I have no message that I can frame for him. Urge him only to go on board his yacht!' `That I will do, my lord!' `There is the draft! Nay—put up the notes. I am satisfied now that you are Tudor's friend!' The young man took the draft and with the notes placed them in his pocket-book. He then rose and gathering his cloak about him, prepared to leave. The Duke arose also, and added— `When shall I have the explanation of this enigma?' `To-morrow, perhaps, or at least very soon your grace!' `I am at a loss to comprehend the machinery of this singular proceeding in relation to Tudor. I act, as a a blind man in the affair, but I trust I shall see the light soon. I think my conduct in this matter will prove to Tudor my care for his reputation, and he should himself henceforth a little more regard it!' The young man now took his leave and the door closed upon him. The Duke set a moment in a thoughtful attitude and then suddenly pulled at the bell. It was answered by a youth dressed as a page. `Merton! Take hat and cloak and follow the young gentleman who just left here. Be cautious and wary, and as soon as you can, bring me word where he stops.' `I obey, your grace,' answered the page, and the next moment he disappeared. `This is altogether,' said the Duke, `one of the most singular affairs! Such an extraordinary young Jew too! So Tudor and the old Jew are in a conspiracy or compact! What can have been his equivalent to be willing to lose his money for the draft and refuse to prosecute besides! What interest could this old Jew have in Tudor's being in possession of the forged draft. Well, I am glad Tudor has had his fears excited; and I hope he will learn a lesson. Nevertheless, he must leave England, This second forgery confirms me in the wisdom of the king's decision. Now if he can be got on board his yacht all will be well yet. Ah—what folly have I been guilty of! The very draft I was to hold up to him in the presence of the officers when we should get to the river's mouth, giving him the choice of exile or a prisoner, I have let pass out of my hands? I have lost the very key to my power. He would laugh at me for threatening him with arrest now, when he holds one of the forged drafts and the pieces of the other lie at my feet. Our plans must be changed; for that he quits England forever, I am resolved upon! He will forge other men's names next, and then there will be no protection for him in a father's forbearance! Ah Merton! returned already?' `Your grace, the gentleman sprung into a hackney coach in waiting, and the driver drove off at top speed, so as to defy any pursuit except it were on horseback.' `Well, let it pass. I shall know by and by I dare say all I desire,' he said in an under tone. `Wait in the ante-room, Merton, as I have a note for you to take to the king soon.' He then took up his pen to add a postscript to the letter he had just before completed to the King, when to his surprise he found it was missing from the table. After a close search his suspicions rested upon the stranger, and believing that he had taken it and would exhibit it to Tudor, filled him with vexation and chagrin. He saw at once that it would not only defeat the King's plot, but would place Tudor in a position of more decided hostility than ever, towards himself. `The fates of this day are against me,' he said bitterly. `My lord duke,' said the page opening the door after the stranger had been ten minutes gone. `Well?' responded the duke sternly. `Ho! did you see a letter lying upon the carpet?' `No, your grace. But —' `Perhaps the wind has swept it off; search the ante-room.' `Your grace, I came in to say that there is a Yorkshire man in the vestibule who insists on coming in, saying he had a letter for you.' `A country-man? Go, bid him deliver it to you, and wait till I have read it.' `I asked him for it, and he said, in his broad dialect he would give it only to your grace's own hand as it wasn't sealed, and `yong eyeses mout peep between it and reed deadly secrets!' `Then show him up. I have strange visitors since dinner. Here comes a hob-nail footstep; heavy enough for the giant Gog. So, fellow you have been so ill-mannered as to force yourself into my presence in this coarse guise of the stable-yard, instead of delivering your message to my page,' said the Duke surveying his tall stout figure clad in a Yorkshire farmer's frock, boots and hat, which latter he kept on his head, tied down with twine passed under his chin. `Take off your hat, sirrah!' `He says he can't, your grace; he told me, when I bade him do it, how he had a wen on the top o' it, big as his fist, and he was `mouty feer'd he'd cotch cold in it, asides, it wasn't sightly!' The Duke smiled at the droll way the flippant page imitated the peasant's dialect and then said, `If you have a letter for me present it?' `Here it be your lor'ship's honor, said the clown, taking it from a huge pocket and thrusting it towards his Grace with a backward scrape of the foot by way of an obeisance. `The gemman said he took it by mistak off the table when he took oop som' money bills he laid thar; and he bade me tell your lordship's honor he didn't oopen it at all!' `It is the very letter I was in search of,' exclaimed the Duke, on casting his eyes upon it. `What gentleman do you speak of? How came this into your hands?' `Voy, yer lordships' honor, I vos a stanin' a lookln'aboot loike, ven a gemmen vot vos a gettin' in a coach guv it to me, and sus, sus he, take this to the Dook and giv it in his own han' and the Dook 'll giv'ye a half crown. So yer lordships' honor I givs it just as I was axed to do!' Here the disguised Tudor Dauling made an awkward bow, and extended his thickly-gloved hand for the coin he had named. The truth of the story was, that Dauling and the Jewess were acting in concert. After he had left the inn in his peasant's frock, with the intention of calling on his father, as his way lay near the Jew's shop, he thought he would, to test his disguise, stop and see if Moloch would be able to recognise him. He entered the shop, and seeing the Jew writing at a low-black desk in one corner, he addressed him, and priced several articles which Moloch showed to him; for rich as the money lender was, he did not disdain to wait on the humblest customer, from whose leathern purse he might possibly transfer a penny to his own iron coffers. While they were thus occupied, Tudor was surprised to see a young man in a fashionable costume descending the narrow stairs and emerge into the shop. At a glance he saw that the face was that of the Jew's neice—his own wife intended! though had he not seen her disguised before as a banker's clerk and now expected to behold her there, he would not have suspected her to have been other than she seemed—a handsome Jewish youth. `You are then ready?' said the Moloch, in a low tone, but which he did not think it of any importance to drop to a whisper before the dull Yorkshire-man. `I am uncle,' answered Rachel, in the same subdued voice, which, however, Dauling overheard. `I tear your plan will fail, and it is besides, a very dangerous one. I wish you would devise some other.' This plan, be it said, was that she should in some way gain audience of the Duke and persuade him to go with her to see his son whom she was to represent as dying from a poison administered by himself, on learning that his father had the evidences of his forgery. The, Duke, knowing, that Tudor and himself were the only persons privacy to this fact, would instantly have credited her words, and believing she came from his son, would hasten to him.— He was to be driven to a certain dwelling near the Jew's house, and then the forged draft was to be demanded of him, and if he resisted it was to be taken from him by threats of death. If he had not the paper with him, he was to be compelled to write an order, and send Racher (still disguised as a young man) to his palace with directions how to get it. Tudor overheard just enough of the conversation between the uncle and neice, to show him that, as he imagined, some personal violence was contemplated against the Duke if he refused their demand. This purpose he was resolved should not be carried out; for he was not so lost as to sufler the life of his father to be put in such peril. He, therefore, abruptly made himself known to them not a little to their astonishment. `I have thought of a better way of managing this matter, Moloch,' he said, after their surprise had a little subsided. `The life and person of the Duke must be held sacred. I can be a party to no act which affects his personal liberty.' `Name your plan, my lort,' said Moloch with a slight frown of displeasure. `You shall draw a bill for six thousand pounds in my favor, and I will place my father's acceptance upon it! Date it when you will, but make it to have matured to-day.' The Jew regarded him with surprise; but, without heeding him. Tudor went on to detail the plan which we have already seen so successfully carried out by the Jewess. His confidence in its being successful was based upon his belief that the Duke, when he found that there was a second forged draft in the hands of a Jewish broker, who had the power to cast the maker of it into prison (but who would decline doing so, if the first draft was given up) would yield it, although he might be ignorant of the motives which actuated the Jew's decision; for Tudor well knew the Duke's paternal weakness, and, although, he feared to have him hold in his hands the evidence of his crime, he felt that it would require circumstances of the most aggravated nature which would induce his father to make up his mind to surrender him to the Jew's mercy, and into the stern power of the law. This plan Moloch approved of, and the bill being made Rachel took it and proceeded on her mission, though, secure in his disguise, Tudor was desirous of being himself the messenger to the Duke; for if he, himself, could succeed, he felt that he should be freed from his pledge to the Jewess. But both Moloch and the fair and ambitious Rachel saw this view of the case as well as he, and as they were playing a deep game, as the reader will yet discover, it was no part of theirs to relinquish a single advantage they had obtained. Finding he must yield, Tudor suffered her to depart: and, anxious to ascertain the result, he soon followed the hackney-coach and waited outside the palace. `What success?' he asked as the Jewess approached the carriage, looking over as she walked, an open letter. `I have obtained it, my lord,' she answered with a look of pleasure. `But here is something that concerns you! My eye caught your name and the address to the king, and thinking you ought to know what the Duke was communicating respecting you, I took it up unseen. Perhaps you can understand it better than I can! You will soon be with my uncle?' she said placing the letter in his hand and springing into the carriage. `Yes,' answered Tudor with a sigh at the prospect of losing his liberty to the Jewess. He felt, for a moment, he had rather have braved the consequences of its possession by his father. He now read the letter which she had placed in his hands and saw at once through the plot which was formed against him. With quick presence of mind he resolved, favored by his disguise, to return it at once to the Duke, before he could suspect he could have seen it; for he knew the conspiracy would not be carried out if it was suspected he was advised of it; and it was by no means his wish, now, that it should be stopped</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX The Bride. Tudor, satisfied with being able, unsuspected, to restore the letter so soon to the Duke, who, after questioning him closely was convinced that the young Jew had taken it by accident and had not had time to read it, now resolved to leave before he should be detected. But, first to preserve his assumed character, he asked for the half crown. `Oh, ah! Merton, give the man a crown piece!' `Come with me, Yorkshire, and I'll give it to you,' said the page, flippantly, opening the door for him to pass out. `Good day, yer lordship's honor,' said Dauling making a bow; and then turning he followed the page into the ante-room, where, after receiving the money he was about passing out when a lovely child of nine or ten years of age, came bounding along the hall from a distant drawing-room, her hair fluttering about her shoulders like a cloud of golden wings with which she seemed to fly—so light and graceful was her motion. On seeing the supposed countryman she stopped, and stared upon him with a look of amused surprise; for the contrast between his coarse dress and the elegance that surrounded him was ludicrously striking; and it was seldom she had seen so strange a looking person in the palace. `Merton, who is that?' she said, whispering in the page's ear and shrinking a little behind him while she fixed her large azure eyes upon her disguised brother; for this lovely child was the lady Mary, the Duke's only daughter, the heiress of his name and vast domains. When Tudor beheld her he also stopped. The sight of her gave him both pleasure and pain! He loved her tenderly as a child and sister, but he could not reconcile himself to regard with equanimity the high position she enjoyed and which he felt should be his own! Of late, dark thoughts had been mingling with his better feelings towards her as the usurper of his rights; and only that day he had internally formed a resolution that if he failed to get the forged draft into his possession, he would, by some stratagem get the child into his power and hold her as a counterbalance. The knowledge he had but a few moments before obtained from the contents of the Dake's letter to the King had stung him to the soul, and roused in his heart the most indomitable revenge against his father for thus treacherously conspiring against him. The letter had given him a sufficient insight into the conspirrcy to let him perceive that he was to be taken in a trap; and under the pretence of conveying a prisoner of state, he was to receive on board his father, masked as such, and a posse of officers, who in some way were to compel him from the realm or arrest him for his forgeries. This information vaguely seen as its chief features were, was sufficient to place him at once in an antagonistic position to the Duke; and he had quitted his presence, hiding, under the assumed awkwardness of his manner, a heart of resolute revenge. He looked upon his sister now, therefore, with eyes far from affectionate: for the sight of her renewed all his bitterness against that destiny which had made him an outcast from the name and house of his father. While he gazed upon her he had formed a purpose in his mind which he resolved to execute. Observing that his steady gaze alarmed the child and offended the page, he turned away and left the Palace. The Duke, in the meanwhile, remained for some minutes holding the re-covered letter in his hand and in deep thought. `There is no question but that it was taken by accident, or why returned? The probability is that it was not opened and read. At any rate Tudor has not seen it, and this person could not have understood anything from it—at least sufficient to gave Tudor any idea of the truth. There was a fairness and honesty in returning it that leads me to believe it was not read! I will proceed, therefore, as already decided on; and if it should turn out that Tudor has intimation of our purpose he will not be on board. If he is there I shall know he is ignorant of the conspiracy against him.' On leaving the palace the captain of the yacht after exchanging his disguise at the Inn for his own uniform, took his way to Moloch's. On his arrival there he was shown into the Jew's private chamber where he found Rachel, who had resumed her female attire, and was looking more beautiful than he had ever seen her; for her success had given color to her cheek and brilliancy to her eyes. `Well, my lort, you see ve haf te draft,' said Moloch, with a quiet smile of inward satisfaction gleaming upon his dark features. And he exhibited it to Tudor as he spoke. Rachel obtained it, the plan you suggested, my lort!' `Then I have not so much obligation upon me,' said Tudor, wishing to avoid the marriage. `My lort must fulfil his opligation,' answered Moloch, coldly and firmly. `And marry your neice?' `Yes, my lort!' `I will give her —.' `What haf you to gif, my lort?' said the Jew, dryly. `True. I am a beggar! And this is what surprises me! Will you cast her way upon an adventurer!' `Such was the compact between us, my lort!' `And will you consent to sacrifice yourself to such an one as I am, fair Rachel? Your beauty and fortune will command a match more worthy of you!' `I am ready, my lord to fulfil my part of the compact,' said the Jewess, smiling and speaking in a way that fascinated Tudor. `Be it so, then! for while Moloch holds that draft I am in his power! But you know it is a part of the compact that I leave you with your uncle!' `I obey, my lord,' answered the noble looking Jewess maiden, casting her eyes to the floor. `Nay, I do believe,' said Dauling to himself, I shall take a fancy to be proud of her and display her to the world! You were to give her a dowry, Moloch?' `Yes, my lort. I will gif her ten tousant pound now, and py and py, if your lortship treats her kind, I shall gif her very mootch more monies!' `Very well, I am content, Moloch. When is it you desire the ceremony should take place?' `Now?' `In the Jewish form?' `Both in the Jewish and christian form,' answered Moloch, firmly. `You mean to bind me closely, I see! Well, I am ready!' `Your lortship will please sign dis paper?' said Moloch, placing a formidable looking parchment before him. `What is this?' `Let my lort read it!' `Why this is folly! I, promise and bind myself to settle the yearly annuity of twenty thousand pounds upon my wife Rachel during the length of her natural life! I am not worth a groat.' `Will you sign it?' `You jest!' `My lort will please sign it, and I will then transfer to you this check for ten thousand pounds her dowry!' `But I can never pay it.' `That is no matters, my lort.' `But what can be your motive?' `To let my Jewish friends believe I have married my neice well. I care not whether your lordship pays a groat of it, nor do I expect it.' `Well, I'll do it,' said Dauling with a light laugh; and taking the pen he was about to sign it when Moloch arrested his hand and said, `Wait, the witnesses, my lort.' He rung a little bell and an inner door opened and two Jews entered, followed by two citizens of London. `There are the witnesses my lort.' `I care not if there were a score of them, Moloch. The instrument would be of no higher worth!' As he spoke he affixed, in a bold hand, his signature to the settlement. `Vill your lortship please add pelow te name. son of the Duke of —' `With pleasure, Moloch: and cousin to the king, if you like it.' `No, the first part is enough, my lort.' `There it is! I congratulate you, Moloch, on your alliance with so distinguished a person.' This was spoken in a light, ironical manner. Moloch made no reply but again touched the bell and a Jewish Priest entered in his robes and the ceremony of marriage was performed by him, Tudor wearing a reckless smile upon his face, the Jewess grave and yet with a quiet look of pride and triumph that he was at a loss to explain under the circumstances. After the priest had retired the bell was again rung and a magistrate entered and performed the ceremony after the form of the Established Church. The two Jews and two citizens affixed their names to the certificates as witnesses of both. `Now, venerable uncle mine,' said the bridegroom after the three were once more left alone, this matter being arranged, I trust to your satisfaction and that of my beautiful bride, I will, with your permission take my draft and destroy it!' Moloch placed it in his hand, when Tudor tearing it in pieces deliberately consumed the fragments in the flame of the lamp, saying, `Thus perish the last evidence of my crime.' `You forget the draft which Rachel took to the bank!' said Moloch with a smile. `True! But that I am not interested in. This is the Duke's affair; who will be at no loss on whom to fix the act after what has occurred. But he can bring no proof against me in this case! But I have something to say to you, Moloch touching the Duke; for the letter you gave me fair bride, was full of information that was needful to me.' Tudor then related the discovery he had made and signified his intention of receiving the Duke and his party as if nothing had occurred; and keeping clear of the frigate hold them in his own power! But you look thoughtful Moloch! Do you oppose this scheme?' `I do, my lort,' answered the Jew with a dignity of decision in his manner, that struck Dauling. `Name your objections, Moloch! You know I am now my father's deadly foe. I have detected him in a treacherous plot against, perhaps, my life! and I mean to take him and his accomplices in the snare he is setting for me!' `My lort—' `Have done with your eternal, my lort! I am no lord, Jew, and I always think you call me so in mockery. Mister me, man, mister me!' The Jew and his neice interchanged a secret look, and a quiet smile passed over the face of the latter. Dauling did not observe it. `I have one request to make of you, then, Mister Dauling,' said the Jew impressively. `Name it quickly; for I must at once be on board. It is already dark. I am impatient to get into my lord Duke's trap! A states' prisoner hey! Prisoner he shall be at any rate.' `Will my lort hear me?' `Mister Dauling will hear thee! go on!' said the Captain of the Yacht impatiently; for he had already risen and without seeming to think of his new bride, had advanced toward the door to open it and depart. `Before you go on this affair, I must see the Duke!' `You!' exclaimed Dauling with astonishment. `Yes, my lort! I wish to see him in person and have a few words of conversation with him.' `To what end? He is by this time at the Tower waiting for me to put my feet into the snare, both he and the King have set for me.' Moloch was silent a few moments and seemed to be closely meditating upon some course of action. Suddenly his face lighted up with that expression of satisfaction which comes upon the countenance when a happy idea has been struck upon. Turning to his neice he addressed her a few words in Hebrew. She made no reply save by an answering look of intelligence and then crossing over to her husband she laid her hand upon his arm and looking up into his face with an eloquent gaze of tenderness, said, `Tudor, my noble lord, let me, your wife, ask a first favor of you, and I beg you will not refuse it.' `Speak, Rachel,' he said, looking down upon her beautiful face and into her deep, dark eyes which charmed his own, `speak and I will grant it; for I begin to feel that I have a wife whom yet, perhaps, I may both love and feel proud of! What have thy pretty lips to utter?' `Promise me that you will stay here with my uncle until my return!' `Whither do you go?' `But a short hour's absence.' `Do you not know I can controul your movements now, fair wife? Thou hast not asked thy leige lord; for faith I am thy lord if no body's else,' he said laughing. `But thou shalt not go unless I know where and for what!' `Thou shalt know on my return.' `Truly, I dare say. It is a ruse to keep me from my yacht. You would save the duke from the punishment I have in store for him!' His countenance darkened with displeasure as he uttered this suspicion. `You are right, my lord,' said she firmly. `I wish to convev a message to the duke to meet you here!' `To meet me here?' `Yes, Tudor.' `For what purpose?' `That my uncle will tell you during my absence.' Dauling looked inquiringly at the Jew, who was busily writing a note, and said, `Explain this matter, Moloch?' `It is af the greatest importance, my lort, to your happiness and interests,' said the Jew, `that you do not go to your yacht before seeing the duke. If I knew he was at his palace I would at once go to him there; but, as it is, I must try and get him here. Go, Rachel, with this note and be diligent and wise in the execution of this mission, as it is the last you will do by my command.' Ere Dauling could arrest her progress she was out of the room. He would have followed her, but the hand of the money-lender was laid firmly upon his wrist. `She must go, my lort. Sit down and hear what I have to tell! It concerns both thee and thy sister!' Moloch then locked the door and removed the key. `Ha! what have you strange about her or me that you take this course to compel me to listen?' `Be seated, my lort, and you shall hear!' `Moloch, if you detain me so that thereby I lose my revenge on the Duke for his treachery, your life shall answer for it!' `Your lortship shall take my life freely, if I do not show you goot reasons for all dis,' answered the Jew smiling. `Then say what thou hast to say,' cried Tudor throwing himself into a chair; `I have given my word to thy neice, now my wife, that I will wait her return. I believe you are my friend, Moloch, and I will hear what you have to reveal.' Leaving the Jew to make known to Dauling the extraordinary facts, which will soon be given to the reader, we shall proceed to the Tower, in a room in which, over-looking the Dock, sat the Duke, Sir John Trenly the keeper, and others. The window commanded a view of the yacht, which was seen through the dim twilight, at anchor off the stairs, and in perfect order for sea. The Duke was in his ordinary attire, but near him upon a table lay a cloak and a mask, under which, in the character of a State's Prisoner, he intended to go passenger in the yacht. `It is getting late, your grace,' said Sir John, who had been sworn in as a party to this conspiracy. `Will Tudor be here think ye?' `Unless he has got intimation of our purpose. The King believes that the letter was taken intentionally, was read and that the facts in it were verbally conveyed by the person to him. This is very probable. Ah, here comes a soldier from the gate, Sir John, bea ing a note. `It is addressed to your grace, said the Knight receiving it at the door and handing it to the Duke. The Duke tore the seal, and read as follows: `My lord, The writer has positive evidence that the plot you have arranged for the purpose of banishing your son from England, is known to him through means of a letter taken from your table to-day. In a word, the person who returned the letter to you was no other than your son, lord Tudor, disguised as a peasant. He returned the letter to lull all suspicions of his having learned the contents. His object in being in disguise near your palace was to get early intelligence respecting the fate of the forged draft your grace held! From what I have written above, your grace will perceive I am acquainted with the circumstances that interest you, and that I am also your friend. Will your grace, therefore grant the writer an interview, as the writer has a subject of great importance to make known, deeply affecting the interests of both of the children of your grace. If your grace will return with the bearer who is provided with a coach, to the abode of the writer, he will be able to give information to your grace of the deepest moment to his happiness. If your-grace declines (under the seeming mystery of the circumstances) to trust your self with the bearer, to be conveyed to the writer's abode, the writer will wait on his grace at his own palace at eight o'clock, this evening.' The note bore neither date nor signature. Yet, after a moment's reflection, the Duke resolved to comply with the request contained in it; and being a bold man, fears of personal violence by entrusting himself with strangers he knew not where, did not occur to him to cause him to waver in his determination. Informing, sir John, briefly, that the plot had been discovered and dismissing his accomplices, the Duke left the tower alone, passed out of the gate and found a hackney-coach in waiting. `Do you go with me, my lord?' said a voice he instantly recognised as that of the handsome Jewish youth, as he approached a muffled figure standing by it. `Then this letter came then, from you!' said his grace, firmly. `No, my lord, I am but its bearer! My father, the Jew, wrote it.' `I am glad to meet you again! I hope these mysteries will be now solved by you or by the Jew, thy father! Enter, I go with thee!'</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. The Signet. `What street is this?' demanded the Duke as they alighted beneath a lamp at the door of the money-lender's shop. `Monmouth street, your grace,' answered Rachel. `This is my father's abode.' `True. I should have known that, being a Jew, he should live in Monmouth street. Now go in, young man, and I will follow thee: but beware of treachery, for see you I am not without means of defence;' and the nobleman touched lightly with his finger the hilt of his sword, an appendage worn at that day by every private gentleman. `Nay, thou wilt have no cause for drawing thy sword here, my lord! Stoop, my lord, for the ceiling is low.' `'Tis a dark stair way this,' said the Duke to himself, instinctively taking his sword into his hand, yet going boldly up after her. `It will be lighter soon, my lord,' she said as she struck upon the door at the landing. It was opened by Moloch in person. The chamber was brightly lighted by wax candles in massive silver stands, and the Duke stood still, surprised by the luxury and elegance of the apartment, so widely contrasting the shop through which he had come. He then fixed his eyes on the dark Israelitish face of Moloch, its high, bold features and strong lines, strengthened by the manner in which the light fell upon his head. There was something in the Jew's appearance that seemed to impress tho Duke with strange interest, for he fixed his gaze upon him steadily for a few seconds, as if recalling some painful recognition. `My lord Duke, I am happy to have this honor,' said Moloch in a manner at once haughty and deferential. `My poor threshold is seldom crossed by such noble guests. Be seated, your grace.' Still the Duke stood surveying him without removing his eyes from his face. Moloch turned his head and addressing a few words in Hebrew to Rachel, she retired leaving the two alone. `You sent me this letter, Jew,' said the Duke, inquiringly, holding it out in his hand. `I did, my lort Duke!' `You are a Jewish broker?' `Such is my profession, your grace. Will your lortship do me the honor to pe seated?' `No, I have no leisure. If you possess interesting information, you darkly hint at in this letter, I am here to hear it; but first I would ask you what common bond of interest exists in common between you and my unfortunate son! you a money-lender and he a gaming spendthrift without money or manor?' `You shall learn my lort Duke! Thy son is my nephew-in-law!' gave the Jew answer in an even tone of voice while his eyes watched the impression his words made, `Thy nephew? How is this?' `He ish wedded to mine neice!' `Tudor Dauling wedded to a Jewess!' `No less, my lort. He has this day taken to wife a daughter of the race of Abraham!' `Jew! dost thou speak the truth?' `I do, your Grace. Behold here de instrument which confirms it!' The Duke looked at the certificate and his face became pale as the confirmation of the truth pressed upon him. `This disturbs thee, my lort,' said Moloch, speaking very slightly in his Jewish dialect as he commenced with the noble; `I did suppose it mattered little to thee whom he wedded, Jew or Gentile?' `But a Jewess!' `Was the mother of thy Christ!' `That my blood should thus be degraded;' not heeding this reproof of his prejudices: `I would have cared less had he been hanged! `My lort he vould haf been hanged iv he did not marry her; put for me he would never have got out of the dangerous situations he put himself in!' `To save him from the gallows you have married him to your neice?' `And I gave her a dowry of ten thousand pounds! It was worth that to wed a Duke's son!' added Moloch with a peculiar expression. `Thou art the first Jew I ever knew to be guilty of a folly! Didst thou include the six thousand pounds which you advanced him on the forged draft which I tore up in the presence of your son?' asked the Duke with a sneer. `No, my lort!' `Thy neice and thy money are both thrown away. Henceforth Tudor may go his own way to infamy and death. I will, henceforth, be regardless of his honor; for he who will stoop so low as to wed a Jewess, has no honor worth possessing!' `Your grace loves not the race of Apraham!' `No.' `I knew this well!' responded the Jew, and partly for this did I urge this union; but there were other and deeper motives as you shall see.' `The motive must have been deep to lead you to give your neice (if she were fair, or even of common worth) to an outcast, when you had no prospect of gain, but every thing to lose.' `My neice was fair, and of worth as your grace, shall, ere long, satisfy yourself. She was very dear to me, as my own daughter, and therefore I sought for her this match!' `A poor prize has she won in the lottery of marriage. But if she be but half as fair to the eye, and but a tenth part so clever in intellect and education as thy son, then Tudor's choice need not so much to be wondered at, as thine own and hers. Did she marry him willingly?' `Willingly, my lort, Duke!' `Knowing all his vices?' `All, my lort!' `Then thou art a fool, Jew, and she a fool's neice, and I wish you both great comfort with your hymeneal acquisition. Now, if thou hast no more than this to reveal, I will leave thee, thanking thee for thy news; for, by our Heaven! it is rare and needeth thanks. `You are bitter and ironical, my lort. Have I not done thee service in warning thee not to adventure in the yacht!' `True, and for this you place me under obligations,' said the Duke in a more natural tone. `But' he added in a sarcastic way, `what is thy purpose with thy noble-blooded nephew? Dost thou mean to teach him the mystery of money-getting! By the mass I would like to see him when he is well-taught!' `Your grace is pleased to be facetious,' said Moloch with singular calmness yet compressing his lips as if the calmness were forced! `Your grace has a daughter?' he added abruptly. `Well, what is thy purpose in naming this fact?' said the Duke with surprise. `You love her!' continued the Jew, in the same even tone. `I do! What danger menaces her?' he asked in alarm, impressed by the money-lender's manner, with some apprehension of evil to her. `Which would your grace prefer, should inherit your name and rank, and wide domain? thy daughter or thy son?' `This is a strange question, Jew!' `I would know if you had choice between them in your heart!' The child is dear to me, but not dearer than Tudor once was, and still would have been but for his conduct! But what is this to do with the matter. I asked you what your purpose was with your son, nephew-in-law! for although he has forfeited my love, still I feel an interest in him still! Besides, I would like to know the hidden mystery of this strange union. What deeper purpose than I can fathom has your sagacity at heart?' asked the Duke, haughtily. `Dost thou hope I will pay thee a large sum of money to keep this marriage a secret? If this is thy hope, Jew, thou art deceived. I have been weak, but henceforth I leave Tudor to his own self-shaped destinies!' `I will explain to your grace, my purpose in bringing about this marriage, which has been for years on my heart; and to which very end I have educated my neice!' `Educated her to be the wife of Tudor Dauling?' `Yes, my lord Duke. From her tenth year, her education has been directed with this ultimate object. Tudor knew not of it—nay, he saw her himself but lately; but on him I have kept my eye steadily till the hour for the consummation of my wishes should arrive! `This is strange language and incomprehensible,' said the Duke, with interest in his looks. `I see you have something still to unfold. Proceed; I will hear this riddle out!' `My lord duke here is the key to the solution,' said Moloch, taking from a casket and placing in his hand a signet ring. On receiving it the Duke's face changed color, and with a trembling hand he quickly brought it close to his eyes as if to confirm by some secret mark the recognition he had made. `Where—where—how did you come by this ring?' he asked with broken words; for the sight of it had produced an extraordinary impression upon him. `Does my lord Duke remember thirty-seven years ago when a student at Oxford, striking a Jew?' asked Moloch, slowly, and fixing his dark, Arabian eyes upon the face of the nobleman. `I do—wert thou then that Jew?' demanded the nobleman. `I am, my lord Duke. You was with a party of merry companions, and meeting me in the suburbs of the University, struck me because I refused to take off my hat to a guide post in the form of a cross that stood at the corner of two ways, and say `Jesus is the Christ.” `Well!' said the Duke impatiently. `I never forgave the blow, my lord!' `I care not for thy forgiveness, Jew,' answered the Duke, haughtily. `What about this signet which I hold?' `You shall know,' began the Jew; but we omit his dialect in the narrative he is about to give. `I threatened to be avenged of you. I followed you day and night to have an opportunity that would be safe to myself. I was your shadow unseen. I discovered your visits to the daughter of a poor baronet and followed you there, I overheard from an arbour where I watched an opportunity to strike you to the heart, I overheard your pledge to wed her! I heard you give it under the partly assumed name of Henry Tudor Dauling. You start! But listen patiently, for I will soon be done with what I have to say. I, alone, knew your true rank and name to be Henry Tudor, Duke of —! I went to the country priest whom I overheard you mention as the person to unite you to your victim; for I had planned a new sort of vengeance. I told the good man your intention of coming to his rustic church in the evening to be united to the lovely girl who believed you to be sincere. I told him that he must deceive the false nobleman in his wicked purposes. He consented without bribe or reward, for he felt it was an act of duty to prevent a fictitious marriage under a false name. He, therefore, prepared the certificates, with your true name and title! my lord duke. You were married under your true name of Henry as was your wife under hers! The priest had prepared the church record in the same manner as the certificate, omitting the name of `Dauling.' Before asking you to sign this, the clergyman, you remember, asked you for your signet to annex also. You drew it from your finger without thinking, but had hardly got it off when you seemed to recollect that it would betray you, therefore you suffered it to fly off from your finger as if by accident, to a distant part of the shadowy aisle. `No matter about the signet,' you said quickly. `Let me sign the record.' It was handed to you! The priest closely watched your pen, and when you had ended the name of Tudor, he let the record book fall as if by accident, the lights were also knocked over by it and the church was left in darkness! You did not delay to search for your ring, but telling the priest falsely that it was one you had bought of a Jew, you desired him, if he found it, to send it to you at such a place. You then groped your way from the church, too conscious of having in your heart performed a wicked part towards your fair young wife, to think about completing your name, and unsuspecting the consequences that might result from it! Your signet was found and now is in your grace's hands! On the record of the village church of Hamersley your grace will find recorded the marriage of Henry Tudor with her whom he believed he was only making his mistress. There were two witnesses also present, my lord, who knew you well and whom I called for the purpose of bearing testimony to your nuptials and identifying you as the young Duke of—. Thus, your grace, will see that you were the lawful husband (contrary to your wishes had suspicions) of the baronet's daughter, and that your son Tudor Dauling is the legimate heir to your title, name and rank. These facts being thus known to me, I being the chief agent in producing them, I resolved that I would not take your life for the blow, but suffer you to live, for I was partly avenged by the success of my stratagem, and by and by take advantage as circumstances should offer of my knowledge and power. Your wife gave birth to a son and soon after died. I watched his growth and as he grew up to youthful years my thoughts were daily upon him and also upon your grace. I could not decide how I should best avail myself of my power. At length my brother died, leaving an only daughter to my guardianship. She was beautiful, intelligent, and soon became attached to me. My long conceived plans now suddenly assumed shape and tangibility. I resolved, that I would educate her to become the wife of the supposed bastard. But I will not detail the steps which I took. The result of my success, your grace, is already fully aware! The neice of the money-lender Moloch, is the daughter-in-law of the haughty Duke of — and a peeress of the realm of England. It would be impossible to convey any adequate idea of the emotions with which the confounded and astonished nobleman listened to this developement of facts, for facts he felt convinced they were. Moloch sat a few minutes, closely watching his pale countenance and silently enjoying his revenge; for if ever one human being had worked out the full meed of vengeance against another, Moloch the Jew was certainly the man. The Duke sat transfixed, and immoveable, with an expression upon his face as if going over the past in his thoughts. At length he sprung to his feet! A smile that perplexed Moloch passed across his mouth as he said quickly, `Prove me this, Jew!' `Thy marriage?' `Yes. Prove it me that it is as you say!' `Here are the proofs, your grace,' answered the Jew, laying before him certain papers. The Duke examined them and saw that there could no longer be any doubt as they were regularly made out certificates of the clergyman and witnesses that Henry Tudor, Duke of — had been lawfully joined in wedlock to Mary — the daughter of Sir George Healey, knight. `Does my son know this?' asked the Duke hoarsely. `I do, my noble father,' answered Tudor advancing from the recess. I kneel for a father's blessing, and do here upon my bended knee solemnly objure and cast off my follies and crimes to which the force of circumstances had driven me, and will henceforth be thy loving son, and seek by a life of integrity and honor to be worthy of the proud name and rank I inherit.' The Duke gazed upon him at first coldly, and then tenderly embraced him: `Tudor,' said he with deep emotion, `I am not sorry that this thing has happened, as it proves to be, it has relieved my soul from a heavy weight which my intended injustice to your sainted mother has cast upon it. I tenderly loved her, and I have loved you for her sake; and for her sake I forgive you the past and acknowledge you as my son. Moloch I can thank thee for thy stratagem. Thy revenge hath been turned aside from the mark like an arrow ill-shot!' `Nay, does your grace forget in thy joy at recovering, and son of thy name that he has a Jew's daughter—a despised daughter of Israel for his bride whom thou must acknowledge too!' 'Tis too true!' answered the Duke, turning pale at the recollection. `Alas, Tudor, that this discovery had not been made earlier, and I had found thee free from this debasing alliance! The Jew hath his revenge!' `But that he had wedded my niece, your grace, the secret would have been still a secret. I have revealed it only for the sake of this alliance, by which my revenge would humble you!' `Let me behold thy wife!' said his grace, sadly and sternly. The duke started back with surprise and pleasure as he beheld not only a woman of matchless beauty, but recognised in her the features and expression of the Jewish youth he had taken such interest in. `Your beauty and dignity placed eloquently in defence of your birth and race,' said the Duke as he advanced and took her hand. `I see I must needs compromise this matter and accept thee for my daughter; for by the rood! thou hast a face and person that would have graced the throne of thy country-woman, Queen Esther! Be, henceforth, a daughter to me, and I will be to thee a father!' Touched with this generous reception, Rachel knelt at his feet to implore his pardon for having taken part to injure him, but raising her up he kissed her cheek and leading her to Tudor, said— `Take her, my sonand wear her close to thy heart; for she is a jewel worthy of thy high position. Moloch,' he added, smiling proudly and turning towards the perplexed and astonished money-lender, `Moloch where is now thy revenge!' `Thou hast conquered it, my nople Duke,' answered Moloch overcome with surprise and admiration. Tudor Dauling was publicly acknowledged by the Duke to be his legitimate son and heir, and when he appeared at Court, the grace and beauty of the Jewess was the theme of every tongue. Lord Tudor reformed his life and character and the lovely Israelite made him a devoted wife. His sister, lady Mary, in due time, wedded Captain, Lord Percy of the navy, a gentleman whom the reader has already known something of as the middy who slipped the cables of the Thames barge and did all that mischief which in the end resulted so happily for all the personages of our story.

      <field name="fulltext">Niagara. LIKE THE RUSH OF THE MIGHTY WATERS OF NIAGARA, BEARING EVERY THING ON ITS COURSE, SO HAS BEEN THE RUSH OF TRADE AT OAK HALL! during the last year and a half. I take this method of tendering MY SINCERE AND MOST GRATEFUL THANKS for the liberal manner the public have come forward and sustained me in this GREAT UNDERTAKING— a great undertaking,' I say—I have had about every Tailor in the United States to contend with—some of them not liking my `LOW PRICE SYSTEM,' have run of the track—others have had as much as they could do to keep in the traces. I have had the whole to keep in their proper sphere and places, and by the assistance of an enlightened public I have succeeded far above my most sanguine expectations; having, on many occasions, been actually obliged to close and fasten my doors, to keep my best friends out. This is a brief sketch of OAK HALL: now established on a basis as firm as the rocks of adamant, It has now arrived at that period when this STUPENDOUS ENGINE OF TRADE AND FASHION, should suspend its operations—the steam let off— the copper cleaned---boilers scraped---and every thing brought to a close by FEBRUARY 1, 1845, as I shall make an entire change in my business at that time.
