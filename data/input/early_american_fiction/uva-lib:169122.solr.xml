      <field name="fulltext">Hic Fructus Virtutis; Clifton Waller Barrett Bookplate: heraldry figure with a green tree on top and shield below. There is a small gray shield hanging from the branches of the tree, with three blue figures on that small shield. The tree stands on a base of gray and black intertwined bars, referred to as a wreath in heraldic terms. Below the tree is a larger shield, with a black background, and with three gray, diagonal stripes across it; these diagonal stripes are referred to as bends in heraldic terms. There are three gold leaves in line, end-to-end, down the middle of the center stripe (or bend), with green veins in the leaves. Note that the colors to which this description refers appear in some renderings of this bookplate, but may not appear renderings such as this and may appear instead in black, white and gray tones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY. The cheerful breeze sets fair; we fill our sail, And scud before it. When the critic starts, And angrily unties his bags of wind, Then we lay to, and let the blast go by. Hurdis. WORTHY AND GENTLE READER! I dedicate this little book to thee with many fears and misgivings of heart. Being a stranger to thee, and having never administered to thy wants nor to thy pleasures, I can ask nothing at thy hands, saving the common courtesies of life. Perchance, too, what I have written will be little to thy taste;—for it is little in accordance with the stirring spirit of the present age. If se, I crave thy forbearance for having thought, that even the busiest mind might not be a stranger to those moments of repose, when the clock of time clicks drowsily behind the door, and trifles become the amusement of the wise and great. Besides, what perils await the adventurous author, who launches forth into the uncertain current of public favor in so frail a bark as this! The very rocking of the tide may overset him; or peradventure some freebooting critic, prowling about the great ocean of letters, may descry his strange colors,—hail him through a gray goose-quill, and perhaps sink him without ceremony. Indeed, the success of an unknown author is as uncertain as the wind. “When a book is first to appear in the world,” says a celebrated French writer, “one knows not whom to consult to learn its destiny. The stars preside not over its nativity. Their influences have no operation on it; and the most confident astrologers dare not foretell the diverse risks of fortune it must run.” It is from such considerations, Worthy Reader, that I would fain bespeak thy friendly offices at the outset. But in asking these, I B would not forestall thy good opinion too far, lest in the sequel I should disappoint thy kind wishes. I ask only a welcome and god-speed; hoping, that when thou hast read these pages, thou wilt say to me in the words of Nick Bottom, the weaver, “I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good master Cobweb.” Very sincerely thine, The Author.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PILGRIM OF OUTRE-MER. Si j'ai long tems été en Romanie, Et outre-mer fait mon pelerinage. Thibaut, Roi De Navarre. THE PILGRIM OF OUTRE-MER. I am a Palmer, as ye se, Whiche of my lyfe muche part have spent, In many a fayre and farre cuntrie, As pilgrims do of good intent. The Four P's. `Lystenyth ye godely gentylmen, and all that ben hereyn!' I am a pilgrim benighted on my way, and crave a shelter till the storm is over, and a seat by the fireside in this honorable company. As a stranger I claim this courtesy at your hands; and will repay your hospitable welcome with tales of the countries I have passed through in my pilgrimage. This is a custom of the olden time. In the days of Chivalry and romance, every baron bold, perched aloof in his feudal castle, welcomed the stranger to his halls, and listened with delight to the pilgrim's tale, and the song of the troubadour. Both pilgrim and troubadour had their tales of wonder from a distant land, embellished with the magic of oriental exaggeration. Their salutation was, `Lordyng lysnith to my tale, That is meryer than the nightingale.' The soft luxuriance of the eastern clime bloomed in the song of the bard; and the wild and romantic tales of regions so far off, as to be regarded as almost a fairy land, were well suited to the childish credulity of an age, when what is now called the old world was in its childhood. Those times have passed away. The world has grown wiser and less credulous;— and the tales, which then delighted, delight no longer. But man has not changed his nature. He still retains the same curiosity—the same love of novelty—the same fondness for romance, and tales by the chimney corner—and the same desire of wearing out the rainy day and the long winter evening with the illusions of fancy, and the fairy sketches of the poet's imagination.—It is as true now as ever, that `Off talys, and tryfulles, many man tellys; Sume byn trew, and sume byn ellis; A man may dryfe forthe the day that long tyme dwellis Wyth harpyng and pipyng, and other mery spellis, Wyth gle, and wyth game.' The Pays d'Outre-Mer, or the Land beyond the Sea, is a name by which the pilgrims and crusaders of old usually designated the Holy Land. I, too, in a certain sense, have been a pilgrim of Outre-Mer; for to my youthful imagination the old world was a kind of Holy Land, lying afar off beyond the blue horizon of the ocean; and when its shores first rose upon my sight, looming through the hazy atmosphere of the sea, my heart swelled with the deep emotions of the pilgrim, when he sees afar the spire which rises above the shrine of his devotion. In this my pilgrimage “I have passed many lands, and countries, and searched many full strange places.” I have traversed France from Normandy to Navarre;—smoked my pipe in a Flemish inn;—floated through Holland in a Trekschuit; trimmed my midnight lamp in a German university; wandered and mused amid the classic scenes of Italy; and listened to the gay guitar and merry castanet on the borders of the blue Guadalquiver. The recollection of many of the scenes I have passed through is still fresh in my mind; whilst the memory of others is fast fading away, or is blotted out forever. But now I will stay the too busy hand of time, and call back the shadowy past. Perchance the old and the wise may accuse me of frivolity; but I see in this fair company the bright eye and listening ear of youth, —an age less rigid in its censure and more willing to be pleased. “To gentlewomen and their loves is consecrated all the wooing language, allusions to love-passions, and sweet embracements feigned by the muse, mongst hills and rivers;—whatsoever tastes of description, battell, story, abstruse antiquity, and law of the kingdome, to the more severe critic. To the one, be contenting enjoyments of their auspicious desires: to the other, a happy attendance of their chosen muses.”1 1. Selden's Prefatory Discourse to the notes in Drayton's Poly-Olbion. And now, fair Dames, and courteous Gentlemen, give me attentive audience;— `Lordyng lystnith to my tale, That is meryer than the nightingale.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1 THE NORMAN DILIGENCE. Crack, crack,—crack, crack;—what a fuss thou makest?—as if it concerned the good people to be informed, that a man with a pale face and clad in black, had the honor to be driven into Paris at nine o'clock at night, by a postillion in a tawny yellow jerkin, turned up with red calamanco! Sterne. THE NORMAN DILIGENCE. The French guides, otherwise called the Postilians, have one most diabolicall custome in their travelling upon the wayes. Diabolicall it may be well called: for whensoever their horses doe a little anger them, they will say in their fury Allons diable, that is, go thou divel. This I know by mine own experience. Coryat's Crudities. It was early in the “leafy month of June,” that I travelled through the beautiful province of Normandy. As France was the first foreign country I visited, every thing wore an air of freshness and novelty, which pleased my eye, and kept my fancy constantly busy. Life was like a dream. It was a luxury to breathe again the free air, after having been so long cooped up at sea: and, like a long-imprisoned bird let loose from its cage, my imagination revelled in the freshness and sunshine of the morning landscape. On every side, valley and hill were covered with a carpet of soft velvet green. The birds were singing merrily in the trees, and the landscape wore that look of gaiety so well described in the quaint language of an old romance, making the “sad, pensive, and aching heart to rejoice, and to throw off mourning and sadness.” Here and there a cluster of chesnut trees shaded a thatch-roofed cottage, and little patches of vineyard were scattered on the slope of the hills, mingling their delicate green with the deep hues of the early summer grain. The whole landscape had a fresh, breezy look. It was not hedged in from the highways, but lay open to the eye of the traveller, and seemed to welcome him with open arms. I felt less a stranger in the land: and as my eye traced the dusty road winding along through a rich cultivated country, and skirted on either side with blossomed fruit trees, and occasionally caught glimpses of a little farm-house resting in a green hollow, and lapped in the bosom of plenty, I felt that I was in a prosperous, hospitable, and happy land. I had taken my seat on top of the Diligence, in order to have a better view of the country. It was one of those ponderous vehicles, which totter slowly along the paved roads of France, laboring beneath a mountain of trunks and bales of all descriptions, and, like the Trojan horse, bore a groaning multitude within it. It was a curious and cumbersome machine, resembling the bodies of three coaches placed upon one carriage, with a cabriolet on top for outside passengers. On the pannels of each door were painted the fleurs-de-lis of France, and upon the side of the coach emblazoned in golden characters: “Exploitation Générale des Messageries Royales des Diligences pour le Havre, Rouen et Paris.” It would be useless to describe the motley groups, that filled the four quarters of this little world. There was the dusty tradesman, with green coat and cotton umbrella; the sallow invalid, in skull-cap, and cloth shoes; the priest in his cassock; the peasant in his frock; and a whole family of squalling children. My fellow travellers on top were a gay subaltern, with fierce mustaches, and a nut-brown village beauty of sweet sixteen. The subaltern wore a military undress, and a little blue cloth cap in the shape of a cow-bell, trimmed smartly with silver lace, and cocked on one side of his head. The brunette was decked out with a staid white Norman cap, nicely starched and plaited, and nearly three feet high; a rosary and cross about her neck; a linsey-woolsey gown, and wooden shoes. The personage who seemed to rule this little world with absolute sway, was a short pursy man, with a busy, self-satisfied air, and the sonorous title of Monsieur le Conducteur. As insignia of office, he wore a little round fur cap, and fur-trimmed jacket; and carried in his hand a small leathern port folio, containing his way-bill. He sat with us on top of the Diligence, and with comic gravity issued his mandates to the postillion below, like some petty monarch speaking from his throne. In every dingy village we thundered through, he had a thousand commissions to execute and to receive: a package to throw out on this side, and another to take in on that: a whisper for the landlady at the inn: a love-letter and a kiss for her daughter: and a wink, or a snap of his fingers for the chamber-maid at the window. Then there were so many questions to be asked and answered, while changing horses! Every body had a word to say. It was Monsieur le Conducteur! here; Monsieur le Conducteur! there. He was in complete bustle; till at length crying en route! he ascended the dizzy height and we lumbered away in a cloud of dust. But what most attracted my attention was the grotesque appearance of the postillion and the horses. He was a comical looking little fellow, already past the heyday of life, with a thin, sharp countenance, to which the smoke of tobacco and the fumes of wine had given the dusty look of wrinkled parchment. He was equipped in a short jacket of purple velvet, set off with a red collar, and adorned with silken cord. Tight pantaloons of bright yellow leather arrayed his pipe-stem legs, which were swallowed up in a huge pair of wooden boots, iron-fastened, and armed with long, rattling spurs. His shirt-collar was of vast dimensions, and between it and the broad brim of his high, bell-crowned, varnished hat, projected an eel-skin queue, with a little tuft of frizzled hair, like a powder-puff at the end, bobbing up and down with the motion of the rider, and scattering a white cloud around him. The horses, which drew the Diligence, were harnessed to it with ropes and leather, and in the most uncouth manner imaginable. They were five in number:—black, white, and gray; as various in size as in color. Their tails were braided and tied up with wisps of straw; and when the postillion mounted and cracked his heavy whip, off they started, one pulling this way, another that; one on the gallop, another trotting and the rest dragging along at a scrambling pace, between a trot and a walk. No sooner did the vehicle get comfortably in motion, than the postillion, throwing the reins upon his horse's neck, and drawing a flint and steel from one pocket, and a short-stemmed pipe from another, leisurely struck fire, and began to smoke. Ever and anon some part of the rope harness would give way; Monsieur le Conducteur from on high would thunder forth an oath or two; a head would be popped 2 out at every window: half a dozen voices exclaim at once, “what's the matter?” and the postillion, apostrophizing the diable as usual, thrust his long whip into the leg of his boot, leisurely dismount, and drawing a handful of packthread from his pocket, quietly set himself to mend matters in the best way possible. In this manner we toiled slowly along the dusty highway. Occasionally the scene was enlivened by a group of peasants, driving before them a little ass, laden with vegetables for a neighboring market. Then we would pass a solitary shepherd, sitting by the road-side, with a shaggy dog at his feet, guarding his flock, and making his scanty meal on the contents of his wallet; or perchance a little peasant girl, in wooden shoes, leading a cow, by a cord attached to her horns, to browse along the side of the ditch. Then we would all alight to ascend some formidable hill on foot, and be escorted up by a clamorous troop of sturdy mendicants,—annoyed by the ceaseless importunity of worthless beggary, or moved to pity by the palsied limbs of the aged, and the sightless eyeballs of the blind. Occasionally, too, the postillion drew up in front of a dingy little cabaret, completely overshadowed by wide-spreading trees. A lusty grape-vine clambered up beside the door; and a pine bough was thrust out from a hole in the wall, by way of tavern bush. Upon the front of the house was generally inscribed in large black letters; “ICI ON DONNE A BOIRE ET A MANGER; ON LOGE A PIED ET A CHEVAL;” a sign which may be thus paraphrased; “Good Entertainment for man and beast;” but which was once translated by a foreigner, “Here they give to eat and drink; they lodge on foot and on horse-back!” Thus one object of curiosity succeeded another; hill, valley, stream and woodland flitted by me like the shifting scenes of a magic lantern, and one train of thought gave place to another; till at length in the after part of the day, we entered the broad and shady avenue of fine old trees, which leads to the western gate of Rouen, and a few moments afterwards, were lost in the crowds and confusion of its narrow streets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE GOLDEN LION INN, AT ROUEN. He is a traveller into former times, whence he hath learnt their language and fashions. If he meets with an old manuscript, which hath the mark worn out of its mouth, and hath lost the date, yet he can tell the age thereof, either by the phrase or character. Fuller's True Church Antiquary. THE GOLDEN LION INN. Monsieur Vinot. Je veux absolument un Lion d'Or; parce qu'on dit, Où allez-vous? Au Lion d'Or!—D'où venez-vous? Du Lion d'Or! —Où irons-nous? Au Lion d'Or!—Où y a-t-il de bon vin? Au Lion d'Or! La Rose Rouge. This answer of Monsieur Vinot must have been running in my head, as the Diligence stopped at the Messagerie; for when the porter, who took my luggage, said; “Où allez-vous, Monsieur?” I answered, without thinking, (for be it said with all the veracity of a traveller, at that time I did not know there was a Golden Lion in the city) “Au Lion d'Or.” And so to the Lion d'Or we went. The hostess of the Golden Lion received me with a courtesy and a smile, rang the house-bell for a servant—and told him to take the gentleman's things to No. 35. I followed him up stairs. One—two—three—four—five—six— seven! Seven stories high—by our Lady!— I counted them every one;—and when I went down to remonstrate, I counted them again; so that there was no possibility of a mistake. When I asked for a lower room, the hostess told me the house was full; and when I spake of going to another hotel, she said she should be so very sorry, so désolée, to have Monsieur leave her, that I marched up again to No. 35. After finding all the fault I could with the chamber, I ended, as is generally the case with most men on such occasions, by being very well pleased with it. The only thing I could possibly complain of, was my being lodged in the seventh story, and in the immediate neighborhood of a gentleman who was learning to play the French horn. But to remunerate me for these disadvantages, my window looked down into a market-place, and gave me a distant view of the towers of the Cathedral, and the ruins of the church and Abbey of Saint-Ouen. When I had fully prepared myself for a ramble through the city, it was already sundown; and after the heat and dust of the day, the freshness of the long evening twilight was delightful. When I enter a new city, I cannot rest till I have satisfied the first cravings of curiosity by rambling through its streets. Nor can I endure a Cicerone, with his eternal “This way, Sir.” I never desire to be led directly to an object worthy of a traveller's notice, but prefer a thousand times, to find my own way, and come upon it by surprise. This was particularly the case at Rouen. It was the first European city of importance that I visited. There was an air of antiquity about the whole city, that breathed of the Middle Ages; and so strong and delightful was the impression, that it made upon my youthful imagination, that nothing, which I afterwards saw, could either equal or efface it. I have since passed through that city; but I did not stop. I was unwilling to destroy an impression, which, even at this distant day, is as fresh upon my mind, as if it were of yesterday. With these delightful feelings I rembled on from street to street, till at length after threading a narrow alley, I unexpectedly came out in front of the magnificent Cathedral. If it had suddenly risen from the earth, the effect could not have been more powerful and instantaneous. It completely overwhelmed my imagination; and I stood for a long time motionless, and gazing entranced upon the stupendous edifice. I had seen no specimen of gothic architecture before, save the remains of a little church at Havre; and the massive towers before me—the lofty windows of stained glass— the low portal, with its receding arches and rude statues—all produced upon my untravelled mind an impression of awful sublimity. When I entered the church, the impression was still more deep and solemn. It was the hour of vespers. The religious twilight of the place—the lamps that burned on the distant altar—the kneeling crowd—the tinkling bell— and the chaunt of the evening service, that rolled along the vaulted roof in broken and repeated echoes—filled me with new and intense emotions. When I gazed on the stupendous architecture of the church—the huge columns, 3 that the eye followed up till they were lost in the gathering dusk of the arches above—the long and shadowy aisles—the statues of saints and martyrs, that stood in every recess—the figures of armed knights upon the tombs—the uncertain light, that stole through the painted windows of each little chapel—and the form of the cowled and solitary monk, kneeling at the shrine of his favorite saint, or passing between the lofty columns of the church,—all I had read of, but had not seen,—I was transported back to the Dark Ages, and felt as I shall never feel again. On the following day I visited the remains of an old palace, built by Edward the Third, now occupied as the Palais de Justice; and the ruins of the church and monastery of Saint Antoine.—I saw the hole in the tower where the ponderous bell of the Abbey fell through;—and took a peep at the curious illuminated manuscript of Daniel d'Aubonne in the public library. The remainder of the morning was spent in visiting the ruins of the ancient Abbey of St. Ouen, which is now transformed into the Hotel de Ville, and in strolling through its beautiful gardens, dreaming of the present and the past, and given up to “a melancholy of my own.” At the Table d' Hôte of the Golden Lion, I fell into conversation with an elderly gentleman, who proved to be a great antiquarian, and thoroughly read in all the forgotten lore of the city. As our tastes were somewhat similar, we were soon upon very friendly terms; and after dinner, we strolled out to visit some remarkable localities, and took the gloria together in the Chevalier Bayard. When we returned to the Golden Lion he entertained me with many curious stories of the spots we had been visiting. Among others he related the following singular adventure of a monk of the Abbey of Saint Antoine, which amused me so much, that I cannot refrain from presenting it to my readers. I will not, however, vouch for the truth of the story; for that the antiquarian himself would not do. He said he found it in an ancient manuscript of the Middle Ages, in the archives of the public library, and I give it as it was told me, without note or comment.</field>

Fabliau du Bouchier d'Abbeville. Lystyn Lordyngs to my tale, And ye shall here of one story, Is better than any wyne or ale, That ever was made in this cuntry. Ancient Metrical Romance. MARTIN FRANC AND THE MONK OF SAINT ANTHONY. Quoth hee, heer is a chaunce for the nones, For heer hangeth the false Munk by cocks bones. The Mery Jest of Dane Hew. In times of old there lived in the city of Rouen a tradesman, named Martin Franc, who, by a series of misfortunes, had been reduced from oppulence to poverty. But poverty, which generally makes men humble and laborious, only served to make him proud and lazy: and in proportion as he grew poorer and poorer, he grew also prouder and lazier. He contrived, however, to live along from day to day, by now and then pawning a silken robe of his wife, or selling a silver spoon, or some other trifle saved from the wreck of his better fortune; and passed his time pleasantly enough in loitering about the market place, and walking up and down on the sunny side of the street. The fair Marguerite, his wife, was celebrated through the whole city for her beauty, her wit, and her virtue. She was a brunette, with the blackest eye—the whitest teeth—and the ripest nut-brown cheek in all Normandy;—her figure was tall and stately—her hands and feet most delicately moulded—and her swimming gait like the motion of a swan. In happier days she had been the delight of the richest tradesmen in the city, and the envy of the fairest dames; and when she became poor, her fame was not a little increased by her cruelty to several substantial burghers, who, without consulting their wives, had generously offered to stand between her husband and bankruptcy, and do all in their power to raise a worthy and respectable family. The friends of Martin Franc, like the friends of many a ruined man before and since, deserted him in the day of adversity. Of all that had eaten his dinners, and drunk his wine, and philandered with his wife, none sought the narrow alley and humble dwelling of the broken tradesman, save one; and that one was Friar Gui, the sacristan of the Abbey of Saint Anthony. He was a little, jolly, red-faced friar, with a leer in his eye, and rather a naughty reputation for a man of his cloth; but as he was a kind of travelling gazette and always brought the latest news and gossip of the city, and besides was the only person that condescended to visit the house of Martin Franc,— in fine, for the want of a better, he was considered in the light of a friend. In these constant assiduities, Friar Gui had his secret motives, of which the single heart of Martin Franc was entirely unsuspicious. The keener eye of his wife, however, soon discovered two faces under the hood. She observed that the Friar generally timed his visits so as to be at the house when Martin Franc was not at home,—that he seemed to prefer the edge of the evening,—and that as his visits became more frequent he always had some little apology ready, such as `being obliged to pass that way, he could not go by the door without just dropping in to see how the good man Martin did.'—Occasionally, too, he ventured to bring her some ghostly present— such as a picture of the Madonna and child, or one of those little naked images, which are hawked about the streets at the Nativity. Though the object of all this was but too obvious, yet the fair Marguerite perserved in misconstruing the Friar's intentions, and in dexterously turning aside any expressions of gallantry that fell from his venerable lips. In this way Friar Gui was for a long time kept at bay; and Martin Franc preserved in the day of poverty and distress, that consolation of all this world's afflictions—a friend. But finally things came to such a pass that the honest tradesman opened his eyes, and wondered he had been asleep so long. Whereupon he was irreverend enough to tweak the nose of Friar Gui, and then to thrust him into the street by the shoulders. Meanwhile the times grew worse and worse. One family relic followed another;— the last silken robe was pawned:—the last silver spoon sold; until at length poor Martin Franc was forced to `drag the devil by the 4 tail;'—in other words, beggary stared him full in the face. But the fair Marguerite did not even then despair. In those days a belief in the immediate guardianship of the saints, was much more strong and prevalent than in these lewd and degenerate times; and as there seemed no great probability of improving their condition by any lucky change, which could be brought about by mere human agency, she determined to try what could be done by intercession with the patron saint of her husband. Accordingly she repaired one evening to the Abbey of Saint Anthony, to place a votive candle and offer her prayer at the altar, which stood in the little chapel dedicated to Saint Martin. It was already sun-down when she reached the church, and the evening service of the Virgin had commenced. A cloud of incense floated before the altar of the Madonna, and the organ rolled its deep melody along the dim arches of the church. Marguerite mingled with the kneeling crowd, and repeated the responses in Latin, with as much devotion, as the most learned clerk of the convent. When the service was over, she repaired to the chapel of Saint Martin, and lighting her votive tapes at the silver lamp, which burned before his altar, knelt down in a retired part of the chapel, and, with tears in her eyes, besought the saint for aid and protection. Whilst she was thus engaged, the church became gradually deserted, till she was left, as she thought, alone. But in this she was mistaken; for when she arose to depart, the portly figure of Friar Gui was standing close at her elbow! “A fair, good evening to my lady Marguerite,” said he significantly. “Saint Martin has heard your prayer, and sent me to relieve your poverty.” “Then, by the Virgin!” replied she, “the good saint is not very fastidious in the choice of his messengers.” “Nay, good wife;” answered the Friar, not at all abashed by this ungracious reply; “if the tidings are good, what matters it who the messenger may be?—And how does Martin Franc, these days?” “He is well, Sir Gui;” replied Marguerite; “and were he present, I doubt not would thank you heartily for the interest you still take in him and his poor wife.” “He has done me wrong;” continued the Friar, without seeming to notice the pointedness of Marguerite's reply. “But it is our duty to forgive our enemies; and so let the past be forgotten. I know that he is in want. Here, take this to him, and tell him I am still his friend.” So saying, he drew a small purse from the sleeve of his habit, and proffered it to his companion.—I know not whether it were a suggestion of Saint Martin, but true it is, that the fair lady of Martin Franc seemed to lend a more willing ear to the earnest whispers of the Friar. At length she said; “Put up your purse; to-day I can neither deliver your gift nor your message. Martin Franc has gone from home.” “Then keep it for yourself.” “Nay, Sir Monk;” replied Marguerite, casting down her eyes; “I can take no bribes here in the church, and in the very chapel of my husband's patron saint. You shall bring it to me at my house, an' you will, Sir Gui.” The Friar put up the purse, and the conversation, which followed, was in a low and indistinct undertone, audible only to the ears for which it was intended. At length the interview ceased; and,—O Woman! the last words that the virtuous Marguerite uttered, as she glided from the church, were; “To-night;—when the Abbey clock strikes twelve!—remember!” It would be useless to relate how impatiently the Friar counted the hours and the quarters, as they chimed from the ancient tower of the Abbey, whilst he paced to and fro along the gloomy cloister. At length the appointed hour approached; and just before the convent bell sent forth its summons to call the friars of Saint Anthony to their midnight devotions, a figure, with a cowl, stole out of a postern gate and passing silently along the deserted streets, soon turned into the little alley, which led to the dwelling of Martin Franc. It was none other than Friar Gui. He rapped softly at the tradesman's door; and casting a look up and down the street, as if to assure himself that his motions were unobserved, slipped into the house. “Has Martin Franc returned?” enquired he in a whisper. “No;” answered the sweet voice of his wife; “he will not be back to night.” “Then all good angels befriend us!” continued the monk, endeavoring to take her hand. “Not so, Sir Monk,” said she, disengaging herself. You forget the conditions of our meeting.” The Friar paused a moment; and then drawing a heavy leathern purse from his girdle, he threw it upon the table. At the same moment a footstep was heard behind him, and a heavy blow from a club threw him prostrate upon the floor. It came from the strong arm of Martin Franc himself! It is hardly necessary to say that his absence was feigned. His wife had invented the story to decoy the lecherous monk, and thereby to keep her husband from beggary and to relieve herself, once for all, from the importunities of a false friend. At first Martin Franc would not listen to the proposition; but at length he yielded to the urgent entreaties of his wife; and the plan finally agreed upon was, that Friar Gui, after leaving his purse behind him, should be sent back to the convent with a severer discipline than his shoulders had ever received from any penitence of his own. The affair, however, took a more serious turn than was intended; for when they tried to raise the Friar from the ground,—he was dead. The blow aimed at his shoulders fell upon his shaven crown; and in the excitement of the moment Martin Franc had dealt a heavier stroke than he intended. Amid the grief and consternation, which followed this discovery, the quick imagination of his wife suggested an expedient of safety. A bunch of keys at the Friar's girdle caught her eye. Hastily unfastening the ring, she gave the keys to her husband, exclaiming; “For the holy Virgin's sake, be quick! One of these keys unlocks the postern gate of the convent garden. Carry the body thither, and leave it among the trees!” Martin Franc threw the dead body of the monk across his shoulders, and with a heavy heart took the way to the abbey. It was a clear starry night; and though the moon had not yet risen, her light was in the sky, and came reflected down in a soft twilight upon earth. Not a sound was heard through all the long and solitary streets, save at intervals the distant crowing of a cock, or the melancholy hoot of an owl from the lofty tower of the abbey. The silence weighed like an accusing spirit upon the guilty conscience of Martin Franc. He started at the sound of his own breathing, as he panted under the heavy burden of the monk's body; and if perchance a bat flitted near him on drowsy wings, he paused, and his heart beat audibly with terror: such cowards does conscience make of even the most courageous. At length he reached the garden wall of the abbey,—opened the postern gate with the key, and bearing the monk into the garden, seated him upon a stone bench by the edge of the fountain, with his head resting against a column, upon which was sculptured an image of the Madonna. He then replaced the bunch of keys at the monk's girdle, and returned home with hasty steps. When the Prior of the convent, to whom the repeated delinquencies of Friar Gui were but too well known, observed that he was again absent from his post at midnight prayers, he waxed exceedingly angry; and no sooner were the duties of the chapel finished, than he sent a monk in pursuit of the truant sacristan, summoning him to appear immediately at his cell. By chance it happened, that the monk, chosen for this duty, was a bitter enemy of Friar Gui; and very shrewdly supposing that the sacristan had stolen out of the garden gate on some midnight adventure, he took that direction in pursuit. The moon was just climbing the convent wall, and threw its silvery light through the trees of the garden, and on the sparkling waters of the fountain, that fell with a soft lulling sound into the deep basin below. As the monk passed on his way, he stopped to quench his thirst with a draught of the cool water, and was turning to depart when his eye caught the motionless form of the sacristan, sitting erect in the shadow of the stone column. “How is this, Friar Gui?” quoth the monk. “Is this a place to be sleeping at midnight, when the brotherhood are all in their dormitories?” 5 Friar Gui made no answer. “Up, up!—thou eternal sleeper, and do penance for thy negligence. The prior calls for thee at his cell!” continued the monk, growing angry, and shaking the sacristan by the shoulder. But still no answer. “Then by Saint Anthony I'll wake thee! So, so! Sir Gui!”— And saying this he dealt the sacristan a heavy box on the ear. The body bent slowly forward from its erect position, and giving a headlong plunge, sank with a heavy splash into the basin of the fountain. The monk waited a few moments in expectation of seeing Friar Gui rise dripping from his cold bath, but he waited in vain;—for he lay motionless at the bottom of the basin—his eyes open, and his ghastly face distorted by the ripples of the water. With a beating heart the monk stooped down and grasping the skirt of the sacristan's habit, at length succeeded in drawing him from the water. All efforts, however, to resuscitate him were unavailing. The monk was filled with terror, not doubting that the Friar had died untimely by his hand; and as the animosity between them was no secret in the convent, he feared that, when the deed was known, he should be accused of wilful murder. He therefore looked round for an expedient to relieve himself of the dead body; and the well-known character of the sacristan soon suggested one. He determined to carry the body to the house of the most noted beauty of Rouen, and leave it on the door stop so that all suspicion of the murder might fall upon the shoulders of some jealous husband. The beauty of Martin Franc's wife had penetrated even the thick walls of the convent, and there was not a friar in the whole Abbey of Saint Anthony who had not done penance for his truant imagination.—Accordingly the dead body of Friar Gui was laid upon the monk's brawny shoulders,—carried back to the house of Martin Franc, and placed in an erect position against the door. The monk knocked loud and long; and then gliding through a bylane, stole back to the convent. A troubled conscience would not suffer Martin Franc and his wife to close their eyes; but they lay awake lamenting the doleful events of the night. The knock at the door sounded like a death-knell in their ears. It still continued at intervals, rap—rap—rap!—with a dull, low sound,—as if something heavy were swinging against the pannel; for the wind had risen during the night and every angry gust that swept down the alley, swung the arms of the lifeless sacristan against the door. At length Martin Franc mustered courage enough to dress himself and to go down, whilst his wife followed him with a lamp in her hand; but no sooner had he lifted the latch, than the ponderous body of Friar Gui fell stark and heavy into his arms. “Jesu Maria!” exclaimed Marguerite, crossing herself;—“here is the monk again!” “Yes, and dripping wet, as if he had just been dragged out of the river!” “O we are betrayed—betrayed!” exclaimed Marguerite in agony. “Then the devil himself has betrayed us;” replied Martin Franc, disengaging himself from the embrace of the sacristan; “for I met not a living being; the whole city was as silent as the grave.” “Holy Saint Martin defend us!” continued his terrified wife. “Here, take this scapulary to guard you from the evil one;—and lose no time. You must throw the body into the river; or we are lost! Holy Virgin! How bright the moon shines!” Saying this she threw round his neck a scapulary—with the figure of a cross on one end and an image of the Virgin on the other, and Martin Franc again took the dead Friar upon his shoulders and with fearful misgivings departed on his dismal errand. He kept as much as possible in the shadow of the houses, and had nearly reached the quay, when suddenly, he thought he heard footsteps behind him.—He stopped to listen; it was no mistake—they came along the pavement, tramp! —tramp! and every step grew louder and nearer. Martin Franc tried to quicken his pace;—but in vain;—his knees smote together, and he staggered against the wall. His hand relaxed its grasp; and the monk slid from his back, and stood ghastly and straight beside him, supported by chance against the shoulder of his bearer. At that moment, a man came round the corner, tottering beneath the weight of a huge sack. As his head was bent downwards, he did not perceive Martin Franc, till he was close upon him; and when, on looking up, he saw two figures standing motionless in the shadow of the wall, he thought himself waylaid, and, without waiting to be assaulted, dropped the sack from his shoulders, and ran off at full speed. The sack fell heavily on the pavement, and directly at the feet of Martin Franc. In the fall the string was broken; and out came the bloody head—not of a dead monk, as it first seemed to the excited imagination of Martin Franc,—but of a dead hog!—When the terror and surprise caused by this singular event had a little subsided, an idea came into the mind of Martin Franc, very similar to what would have come into the mind of almost any person in similar circumstances. He took the hog out of the sack and putting the body of the monk into its place, secured it well with the remnants of the broken string; and then hurried homeward with the hog upon his shoulders. He was hardly out of sight, when the man of the sack returned, accompanied by two others. They were surprised to find the sack still lying on the ground, with no one near it, and began to jeer the former bearer, telling him he had been frightened at his own shadow on the wall. Then one of them took the sack upon his shoulders, without the least suspicion of the change that had been made in its contents, and all three disappeared. Now it happened that the city of Rouen was at that time infested by three street robbers, who walked in darkness like the pestilence, and always carried the plunder of their midnight marauding to the Tête-de-Bœuf, a little tavern in one of the darkest and narrowest lanes of the city. The host of the Tête-de-Bœuf was privy to all their schemes, and had an equal share in the profits of their nightly excursions. He gave a helping hand, too, by the length of his bills, and by plundering the pockets of any chance traveller, that was luckless enough to sleep under his roof. On the night of the disastrous adventure of Friar Gui, this little marauding party had been prowling about the city until a late hour, without finding any thing to reward their labors. At length, however, they chanced to spy a hog, hanging under a shed in a butcher's yard in readiness for the next day's market; and as they were not very fastidious in selecting their plunder, but on the contrary rather addicted to taking whatever they could lay their hands on, the hog was straightway purloined, thrust into a large sack, and sent to the Tête-de-Bœuf on the shoulders of one of the party, whilst the other two continued their nocturnal excursion. It was this person, who had been so terrified at the appearance of Martin Franc and the dead monk; and as this encounter had interrupted any further operations of the party—the dawn of day being now near at hand,—they all repaired to their gloomy den in the Tête-de-Bœuf. The host was impatiently waiting their return; and, asking what plunder they had brought with them, proceeded without delay to remove it from the sack. The first thing that presented itself, on untying the string, was the monk's hood. “The devil take the devil!” cried the host, as he opened the neck of the sack, “What's this?—Your hog has got a cowl!” “The poor devil has become disgusted with the world, and turned monk!” said he, who held the light, a little surprised at seeing the head covered with a coarse gray cloth. “Sure enough he has,” exclaimed another, starting back in dismay, as the shaven crown and ghastly face of the Friar appeared. “Holy Saint Benedict be with us!—It is a monk, stark dead!” “A dead monk, indeed!” said a third, with an incredulous shake of the head, “How could a dead monk get into this sack?”—No, no: there is some diablerie in this. I have heard it said, that Satan can take any shape he pleases; and you may rely upon it, this is Satan himself, who has taken the shape of a monk to get us all hanged.” “Then we had better kill the devil than have the devil kill us!”—replied the host, crossing himself. “And the sooner we do it, the better; for it is now near day-light, and people will soon be passing in the street.” “So say I;” rejoined the man of magic; 6 “and my advice is to take him to the butcher's yard, and hang him up in the place where we found the hog.” This proposition so pleased the others, that it was executed without delay. They carried the Friar to the butcher's house, and passing a strong cord round his neck, suspended him to a beam in the shed, and there left him. When the night was at length passed, and daylight began to peep into the eastern windows of the city, the butcher arose, and prepared himself for market. He was casting up in his mind, what the hog would bring at his stall, when looking upward—lo! in its place he recognized the dead body of Friar Gui. “By Saint Dennis!” quoth the butcher, “I always feared that this Friar would not die quietly in his cell; but I never thought I should find him hanging under my own roof.— This must not be; it will be said, that I murdered him, and I shall pay for it with my life. I must contrive some way to get rid of him.” So saying he called his man, and showing him what had been done, asked him how he should dispose of the body, so that he might not be accused of murder. The man, who was of a ready wit, reflected a moment, and then answered; “This is indeed a difficult matter; but there is no evil without its remedy.—We will place the friar on horseback—” “What!—a dead man on horseback?— impossible!” interrupted the butcher. “Who ever heard of a dead man on horseback!” “Hear me out, and then judge. We must place the body on horseback, as well as we may, and bind it fast with cords, and then set the horse loose in the street, and pursue after him crying out, that the monk has stolen the horse. Thus all who meet him will strike him with their staves, as he passes, and it will be thought that he came to his death in that way.” Though this seemed to the butcher rather a mad project, yet, as no better one offered itself, at the moment, and there was no time for reflection, mad as the project was, they determined to put it into execution. Accordingly the butcher's horse was brought out, and the Friar was bound upon his back, and with much difficulty fixed in an upright position. The butcher then gave the horse a blow upon the crupper with his staff, which set him into a smart gallop down the street, and he and his man joined in pursuit crying; “Stop thief!—Stop thief!—The friar has stolen my horse!” As it was now sunrise the streets were full of people, peasants driving their goods to market, and citizens going to their daily avocations. When they saw the Friar dashing at full speed down the street, they joined in the cry of “Stop thief!—Stop that horse!” and many, who endeavored to seize the bridle as the Friar passed them at full speed, were thrown upon the pavement, and trampled under foot. Others joined in the halloo! and the pursuit; but this only served to quicken the gallop of the frightened steed, who dashed down one street and up another like the wind, with two or three mounted citizens clattering in full cry at his heels. At length they reached the market place.—The people scattered right and left in dismay—and the steed and rider dashed onward, overthrowing in their course men and women, and stalls, and piles of merchandise, and sweeping away like a whirlwind. Tramp—tramp—tramp! they clattered on; they had distanced all pursuit. They reached the quay; the wide pavement was cleared at a bound—one more wild leap—and splash!—both horse and rider sank into the rapid current of the river—swept down the stream—and were seen no more!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE VILLAGE OF AUTEUIL. Il n'est tel plaisir Que d'estre à gésir Parmy les beaux champs, L'herbe verd choisir, Et prendre bon temps. Martial d'Auvergne. THE VILLAGE OF AUTEUIL. Oyez-vous Ce bruit tant doux Décliquer de la gorgette Du geai mignot, Du linot Et de la frisque allouette? Bonaventure Desperriers. The sultry heat of summer always brings with it, to the idler and the man of leisure, a longing for the leafy shade and the green luxuriance of the country. It is pleasant to interchange the din of the city,—the movement of the crowd,—and the gossip of society, with the silence of the hamlet,—the quiet seclusion of the grove, and the gossip of a woodland brook. As is sung in the old ballad of Robin Hood, In somer when the shawes be sheyn, And leves be large and long, Hit is full mery in feyre foreste, To here the foulys song. To se the dere draw to the dale And leve the hilles hee, And shadow hem in the leves grene, Vnder the grene wode tre. It was a feeling of this kind, that prompted me during my residence in the north of France to pass one of the summer months at Auteuil —the pleasantest of the many little villages that lie in the immediate vicinity of the metropolis. It is situated on the outskirts of the Bois de Boulogne—a wood of some extent, in whose green alleys the dusty cit enjoys the luxury of an evening drive, and gentlemen meet in the morning to give each other satisfaction in the usual way. A cross road, skirted with green hedge-rows, and overshadowed by tall poplars, leads you from the noisy highway of St. Cloud and Versailles to the still retirement of this suburban hamlet. On either side, the eye discovers old chateaux amid the trees, and green parks, whose pleasant shades recall a thousand images of La Fontaine, Racine, and Molière; and on an eminence overlooking the 7 windings of the Seine, and giving a beautiful though distant view of the domes and gardens of Paris, rises the village of Passy, long the residence of our countrymen Franklin and Count Rumford. I took up my abode at a Maison de Santé; not that I was a valetudinarian,—but because I there found some one to whom I could whisper, `How sweet is solitude!' Behind the house was a garden filled with fruit trees of various kinds, and adorned with gravel walks, and green arbors, furnished with tables and rustic seats, for the repose of the invalid and the sleep of the indolent. Here the inmates of the rural hospital met on common ground, to breathe the invigorating air of morning, and while away the lazy noon or vacant evening with tales of the sick chamber. The establishment was kept by Dr. Dent-de-lion, a dried up little fellow, with red hair, a sandy complexion, and the physiognomy and gestures of a monkey. His character corresponded to his outward lineaments; for he had all a monkey's busy and curious impertinence. Nevertheless, such as he was, the village Æsculapius strutted forth the little great man of Auteuil. The peasants looked up to him as to an oracle,—he contrived to be at the head of every thing, and laid claim to the credit of all public improvements in the village:—in fine he was a great man on a small scale. It was within the dingy walls of this little potentate's imperial palace, that I chose my country residence. I had a chamber in the second story, with a solitary window, which looked upon the street, and gave me a peep into a neighbor's garden. This I esteemed a great privilege; for, as a stranger, I desired to see all that was passing out of doors, and the sight of green trees, though growing on another man's ground, is always a blessing. Within doors,—had I been disposed to quarrel with my household gods,—I might have taken some objection to my neighborhood; for on one side of me was a consumptive patient, whose grave-yard cough drove me from my chamber by day,—and on the other, an English Colonel, whose incoherent ravings, in the delirium of a high and obstinate fever, often broke my slumbers by night. But I found ample amends for these inconveniences in the society of those, who were so little indisposed as hardly to know what ailed them, and those, who in health themselves, had accompanied a friend or relative to the shades of the country in pursuit of it. To these I am indebted for much courtesy; and particularly to one, who, if these pages should ever meet her eye, will not, I hope, be unwilling to accept this slight memorial of a former friendship. It was, however, to the Bois de Boulogne, that I looked for my principal recreation. There I took my solitary walk, morning and evening; or, mounted on a little mouse-colored donkey, paced demurely along the woodland pathway. I had a favorite seat beneath the shadow of a venerable oak, one of the few hoary patriarchs of the wood, which had survived the bivouacs of the Allied Armies. It stood upon the brink of a little glassy pool, whose tranquil bosom was the image of a quiet and secluded life, and stretched its parental arms over a rustic bench, that had been constructed beneath it, for the accommodation of the foot-traveller, or, perchance, some idle dreamer like myself. It seemed to look round with a lordly air upon its old hereditary domain, whose stillness was no longer broken by the tap of the martial drum, nor the discordant clang of arms; and, as the breeze whispered among its branches, it seemed to be holding friendly colloquies with a few of its venerable cotemporaries, who stooped from the opposite bank of the pool, nodding gravely now and then, and ogling themselves with a sigh in the mirror below. In this quiet haunt of rural repose, I used to sit at noon,—hear the birds sing, and “possess myself in much quietness.” Just at my feet lay the little silver pool, with the sky and the woods painted in its mimic vault, and occasionally the image of a bird, or the soft watery outline of a cloud, floating silently through its sunny hollows. The water-lily spread its broad green leaves on the surface, and rocked to sleep a little world of insect life in its golden cradle. Sometimes a wandering leaf came floating and wavering downward, and settled on the water; then a vagabond insect would break the smooth surface into a thousand ripples, or a green-coated frog slide from the bank, and plump!—dive headlong to the bottom. I entered, too, with some enthusiasm into all the rural sports and merrimakes of the village. The holidays were so many little eras of mirth and good feeling; for the French have that happy and sunshine temperament— that merry-go-mad character,—which makes all their social meetings scenes of enjoyment and hilarity. I made it a point never to miss any of the Fêtes Champêtres, or rural dances, at the wood of Boulogne; though I confess it sometimes gave me a momentary uneasiness to see my rustic throne beneath the oak usurped by a noisy group of girls, the silence and decorum of my imaginary realm broken by music and laughter, and, in a word, my whole kingdom turned topsyturvy, with romping, fiddling, and dancing. But I am naturally, and from principle too, a lover of all those innocent amusements, which cheer the laborer's toil, and, as it were, put their shoulders to the wheel of life, and help the poor man along with his load of cares. Hence I saw with no small delight the rustic swain astride the wooden horse of the carrousel, and the village maiden whirling round and round in its dizzy car; or took my stand on a rising ground that overlooked the dance, an idle spectator in a busy throng. It was just where the village touched the outward border of the wood. There a little area had been levelled beneath the trees, surrounded by a painted rail, with a row of benches inside. The music was placed in a slight balcony, built around the trunk of a large tree in the centre, and the lamps, hanging from the branches above, gave a gay, fantastic and fairy look to the scene. How often in such moments did I recall the lines of Goldsmith, describing those “kinder skies,” beneath which “France displays her bright domain,” and feel how true and masterly the sketch— Alike all ages; dames of ancient days Have led their children through the mirthful maze, And the gay grandsire, skilled in gestic lore, Has frisked beneath the burden of three-score. Nor must I forget to mention the Fête Patronale,— a kind of annual fair, which is held at mid-summer in honor of the patron saint of Auteuil. Then the principal street of the village is filled with booths of every description; strolling players, and rope-dancers, and jugglers, and giants, and dwarfs, and wild beasts, and all kinds of wonderful shows excite the gaping curiosity of the throng, and in dust, crowds, and confusion the village rivals the capital itself. Then the goodly dames of Passy descend into the village of Auteuil;—then the brewers of Billancourt, and the tanners of Sèvres dance lustily under the greenwood tree; —and then, too, the sturdy fish-mongers of Brétigny and Saint-Yon regale their fat wives with an airing in a swing, and their customers with eels and craw-fish;—or as is more poetically set forth in an old Christmas Carol, Vous eussiez vu venir tous ceux de Saint-Yon, Et ceux de Brétigny apportant du poisson, Les barbeaux et gardons, anguilles et carpettes Etoient à bon marché Croyez, A cette journée-là, La, la, Et aussi les perchettes. I found another source of amusement in observing the various personages that daily passed and repassed beneath my window. The character, which most of all arrested my attention, was a poor blind fiddler, whom I first saw chaunting a doleful ballad at the door of a small tavern near the gate of the village. He wore a brown coat out at elbows, the fragment of a velvet waistcoat, and a pair of tight nankeens, so short as hardly to reach below his calves. A little foraging cap, that had long since seen its best days, set off an open, good-humored countenance, bronzed by sun and wind. He was led about by a brisk middle aged woman, in straw hat and wooden shoes; and a little bare-footed boy, with clear blue eyes and flaxen hair, held a tattered hat in his hand, in which he collected eleemosynary sous. The old fellow had a favorite song, which he used to sing with great glee to a merry, joyous air, the burden of which ran “chantons l'amour et le plaisir!”—let us sing of love and pleasure. I often thought it would have been a good lesson for the crabbed and discontented rich man, to have heard this remnant of humanity,—poor, blind, and in rags, and dependent upon casual charity for his daily bread, singing, in so cheerful a voice, the charms of 8 existence, and, as it were, fiddling life away to a merry tune. I was one morning called to my window by the sound of rustic music. I looked out, and beheld a procession of villagers advancing along the road, attired in gay dresses, and marching merrily on in the direction of the church. I soon perceived that it was a marriage festival. The procession was led by a long orang-outang of a man, in a straw hat and white dimity bob-coat, playing on an asthmatic clarionet, from which he contrived to blow unearthly sounds, ever and anon squeaking off at right angles from his tune, and winding up with a grand flourish on the guttural notes. Behind him, led by his little boy, came the blind fiddler, his honest features glowing with all the hilarity of a rustic bridal, and, as he stumbled along, sawing away upon his fiddle till he made all crack again. Then came the happy bridegroom, dressed in his Sunday suit of blue, with a large nosegay in his button-hole, and close beside him his blushing bride, with downcast eyes, clad in a white robe and slippers, and wearing a wreath of white roses in her hair. The friends and relatives brought up the procession; and a troop of village urchins came shouting along in the rear, scrambling among themselves for the largess of sous and sugar-plums, that now and then issued in large handfuls from the pockets of a lean man in black, who seemed to officiate as master of ceremonies on the occasion. I gazed on the procession till it was out of sight; and when the last wheeze of the clarionet died upon my ear, I could not help thinking how happy were they, who were thus to dwell together in the peaceful bosom of their native village, far from the gilded misery and the pestilential vices of the town. On the evening of the same day, I was sitting by the window, enjoying the freshness of the air, and the beauty and stillness of the hour, when I heard the distant and solemn hymn of the Catholic burial service, at first so faintly and indistinct that it seemed an illusion. It rose mournfully on the hush of evening,— died gradually away,—then ceased. Then it rose again, nearer and more distinct, and soon after a funeral procession appeared, and passed directly beneath my window. It was led by a priest, bearing the banner of the church, and followed by two boys, holding long flambeaux in their hands. Next came a double file of priests in white surplices, with a missal in one hand and a lighted wax taper in the other, chaunting the funeral dirge at intervals,—now pausing, and then again taking up the mournful burden of their lamentation, accompanied by others, who played upon a rude kind of horn, with a dismal and wailing sound. Then followed various symbols of the church, and the bier, borne on the shoulders of four men. The coffin was covered with a black velvet pall, and a chaplet of white flowers lay upon it, indicating that the deceased was unmarried. A few of the villagers came behind, clad in mourning robes, and bearing lighted tapers. The procession passed slowly along the same street, that in the morning had been thronged by the gay bridal company. A melancholy train of thought forced itself home upon my mind. The joys and sorrows of this world are so strikingly mingled! Our mirth and grief are brought so mournfully in contact! We laugh while others weep,—and others rejoice when we are sad! The light heart and the heavy walk side by side, and go about together! Beneath the same roof are spread the wedding feast and the funeral pall! The bridal song mingles with the burial hymn! One goes to the marriage bed; another to the grave; and all is mutable, uncertain and transitory! It is with sensations of pure delight, that I recur to the brief period of my existence, which was passed in the peaceful shades of Auteuil. There is one kind of wisdom, which we learn from the world, and another kind, which can be acquired in solitude only. In cities we study those around us; but in the retirement of the country we learn to know ourselves. The voice within us is more distinctly audible in the stillness of the place; and the gentler affections of our nature spring up more freshly in its tranquillity and sunshine,—nurtured by the healthy principle, which we inhale with the pure air, and invigorated by the genial influences, which descend into the heart from the quiet of the sylvan solitude around, and the soft serenity of the sky above.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JACQUELINE. When thou shalt see the body put on death's sad and ashy countenance, in the dead age of night, when silent darkness does encompass the dim light of thy glimmering taper, and thou hearest a solemn bell tolled to tell the world of it, which now, as it were, with this sound is struck into dumb attention, tell me if thou canst then find a thought of thine devoting thee to pleasure and the fugitive toys of life. Owen Felltham's Resolves. JACQUELINE. Death lies on her, like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field. Shakspeare. “Dear mother,—is it not the bell I hear?” “Yes, my child; the bell for morning prayers. It is Sunday to-day.” “I had forgotten it. But now all days are alike to me. Hark! it sounds again—louder— louder. Open the window, for I love the sound. There; the sunshine and the fresh morning air revive me. And the church bell—oh mother, —it reminds me of the holy sabbath mornings by the Loire—so calm, so hushed, so beautiful! Now give me my prayer-book, and draw the curtain back that I may see the green trees and the church spire. I feel better to-day, dear mother.” It was a bright, cloudless morning in August. The dew still glistened on the trees; and a slight breeze wafted to the sick-chamber of Jacqueline the song of the birds, the rustle of the leaves, and the solemn chime of the church-bells. She had been raised up in bed, and reclining upon the pillow, was gazing wistfully upon the quiet scene without. Her mother gave her the prayer-book and then turned away to hide a tear that stole down her cheek. At length the bells ceased. Jacqueline crossed herself, kissed a pearl crucifix that hung around her neck, and opened the silver clasps of her missal. For a time she seemed wholly absorbed in her devotions. Her lips moved,—but no sound was audible. At intervals the solemn voice of the priest was heard at a distance, and then the confused responses of the congregation, dying away in inarticulate murmurs. Ere long the thrilling chaunt of the Catholic service broke upon the ear. At first it was low, solemn, and indistinct;—then 9 it became more earnest and entreating, as if interceding, and imploring pardon for sin;— and then arose louder and louder, full, harmonious, majestic, as it wafted the song of praise to heaven,—and suddenly ceased. Then the sweet tones of the organ were heard,—trembling, thrilling, and rising higher and higher, and filling the whole air with their rich melodious music. What exquisite accords!—what noble harmonies!—What touching pathos!— The soul of the sick girl seemed to kindle into more ardent devotion, and to be wrapt away to heaven in the full harmonious chorus, as it swelled onward, doubling and redoubling, and rolling upward in a full burst of rapturous devotion!—Then all was hushed again. Once more the low sound of the bell smote the air, and announced the elevation of the host. The invalid seemed entranced in prayer. Her book had fallen beside her,—her hands were clasped, —her eyes closed,—her soul retired within its secret chambers. Then a more triumphant peal of bells arose. The tears gushed from her closed and swollen lids; her cheek was flushed; she opened her dark eyes and fixed them with an expression of deep adoration and penitence upon an image of the Savior on the cross, which hung at the foot of her bed, and her lips again moved in prayer. Her countenance expressed the deepest resignation. She seemed to ask only that she might die in peace, and go to the bosom of her Redeemer. The mother was kneeling by the window, with her face concealed in the folds of the curtain. She arose, and, going to the bed-side of her child, threw her arms around her, and burst into tears. “My dear mother, I shall not live long—I feel it here. This piercing pain—at times it seizes me, and I cannot—cannot breathe.” “My child, you will be better soon.” “Yes, mother, I shall be better soon. All tears and pain and sorrow will be over. The hymn of adoration and entreaty I have just heard, I shall never hear again on earth. Next sabbath, mother, kneel again by that window as to-day. I shall not be here, upon this bed of pain and sickness, but when you hear the solemn hymn of worship and the beseeching tones that wing the spirit up to God, think, mother, that I am there,—with my sweet sister who has gone before us,—kneeling at our Savior's feet, and happy—oh, how happy!” The afflicted mother made no reply,—her heart was too full to speak. “You remember, mother, how calmly Amie died. Poor child, she was so young and beautiful!—I always pray, that I may die as she did. I do not fear death as I did before she was taken from us. But oh—this pain—this cruel pain—it seems to draw my mind back from heaven. When it leaves me I shall die in peace.” “My poor child!—God's holy will be done!” The invalid soon sank into a quiet slumber. The excitement was over, and exhausted nature sought relief in sleep. The persons, between whom this scene passed, were a widow and her sick daughter, from the neighborhood of Tours. They had left the banks of the Loire to consult the more experienced physicians of the metropolis, and had been directed to the Maison de Santé at Auteuil for the benefit of the pure air. But all in vain. The health of the suffering, but uncomplaining patient grew worse and worse, and it soon became evident that the closing scene was drawing near. Of this Jacqueline herself seemed conscious; and toward evening she expressed a wish to receive the last sacraments of the church. A priest was sent for: and ere long the tinkling of a little bell in the street announced his approach. He bore in his hand a silver vase containing the consecrated wafer, and a small vessel filled with the holy oil of the extreme unction hung from his neck. Before him walked a boy carrying a little bell, whose sound announced the passing of these symbols of the Catholic faith. In the rear, a few of the villagers, bearing lighted wax tapers, formed a short and melancholy procession. They soon entered the sick chamber, and the glimmer of the tapers mingled with the red light of the setting sun, that shot his farewell rays through the open window. The vessel of oil and the vase containing the consecrated wafers were placed upon the table in front of a crucifix, that hung upon the wall, and all present excepting the priest, threw themselves upon their knees. The priest then approached the bed of the dying girl, and said in a slow and solemn tone; “The King of kings and Lord of lords has passed thy threshold. Is thy spirit ready to receive him?”— “It is, father.” “Hast thou confessed thy sins?” “Holy father, no.” “Confess thyself, then, that thy sins may be forgiven, and thy name recorded in the book of life.” And turning to the kneeling crowd around, he waved his hand for them to retire, and was left alone with the sick girl. He seated himself beside her pillow, and the subdued whisper of the confession mingled with the murmur of the evening air, which lifted the heavy folds of the curtains and stole in upon the holy scene. Poor Jacqueline had few sins to confess,—a secret thought or two towards the pleasures and delights of the world,—a wish to live, unuttered, but which to the eye of her self-accusing spirit seemed to resist the wise providence of God;—no more. The confession of a meek and lowly heart is soon made. The door was again opened;—the attendants entered, and knelt around the bed, and the priest proceeded; “And now prepare thyself to receive with contrite heart the body of our blessed Lord and Redeemer.—Dost thou believe that our Lord Jesus Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and born of the Virgin Mary?” “I believe.” And all present joined in the solemn response— “I believe.” “Dost thou believe that the Father is God, that the Son is God, and that the Holy Spirit is God,—three persons and one God?” “I believe.” “Dost thou believe that the Son is seated on the right hand of the Majesty on high, whence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead?” “I believe.” “Dost thou believe that by the holy sacraments of the church thy sins are forgiven thee, and that thus thou art made worthy of eternal life?” “I believe.” “Dost thou pardon, with all thy heart, all who have offended thee in thought, word or deed?” “I pardon them.” “And dost thou ask pardon of God and thy neighbor for all offences thou hast committed against them, either in thought, word, or deed?” “I do!” “Then repeat after me; O Lord Jesus, I am not worthy, nor do I merit, that thy divine Majesty should enter this poor tenement of clay; but according to thy holy promises be my sins forgiven, and my soul washed white from all transgression.” Then taking a consecrated wafer from the vase, he placed it between the lips of the dying girl, and while the assistant sounded the little silver bell, said; “Corpus Domini nostri Jesu Christi custodiat animam tuam in vitam eternam.” And the kneeling crowd smote their breasts and responded in one solemn voice; “Amen!” The priest then took from the silver box on the table a little golden rod, and dipping it in holy oil, anointed the invalid upon the hands, feet and breast in the form of the cross. When these ceremonies were completed, the priest and his attendants retired, leaving the mother alone with her dying child, who, from the exhaustion caused by the preceding scene, sank into a death-like sleep. `Between two worlds life hovered like a star, 'Twixt night and morn upon the horizon's verge.' The long twilight of the summer evening stole on; the shadows deepened without, and the night-lamp glimmered feebly in the sick chamber; but still she slept. She was lying with her hands clasped upon her breast,—her pallid cheek resting upon the pillow, and her bloodless lips apart, but motionless and silent as the sleep of death. Not a breath interrupted the silence of her slumber. Not a movement of the heavy and sunken eye-lid-not a trembling of the lip—not a shadow on the marble brow told when the spirit took its flight. It passed to a better world than this. `There's a perpetual spring,—perpetual youth; No joint-benumbing cold, nor scorching heat, Famine, nor age have any being there.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">10 THE SEXAGENARIAN, A SKETCH OF CHARACTER. Youth is full of pleasure, Age is full of care; Youth like summer morn, Age like winter weather; Youth like summer brave, Age like winter bare; Youth is full of sport, Age's breath is short; Youth is nimble, age is lame; Youth is hot and bold, Age is weak and cold; Youth is wild, and age is tame. Shakspeare. THE SEXAGENARIAN. Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are written down old, with all the characters of age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? Shakspeare. There he goes,—in his long russet surtout, —sweeping down yonder gravel walk beneath the trees, like a yellow leaf in Autumn, wafted along by a fitful gust of wind. Now he pauses;—now seems to be whirled round in an eddy,—and now rustles and brushes onward again. He is talking to himself in an undertone as usual; and flourishes a pinch of snuff between his fore-finger and his thumb,—ever and anon drumming on the cover of his box by way of emphasis, with a sound like the tap of a wood-pecker. He always takes a morning walk in the garden,—in fact, I may say he passes a greater part of the day there, either strolling up and down the gravel walks, or sitting on a rustic bench in one of the leafy arbors. He always wears that same dress, too; at least, I have never seen him in any other;— a bell-crowned hat,—a frilled bosom, and white dimity vest, soiled with snuff,—light nankeen smalls,—and, over all, that long and flowing surtout of russet-brown circassian, hanging in wrinkles round his slender body, and toying with his thin rakish legs. Such is his constant garb, morning and evening; and it gives him a cool and breezy look even in the heat of a noon-day in August. The personage, sketched in the preceding paragraph, is Monsieur D'Argentville, a sexagenarian, with whom I became acquainted during my residence at the Maison de Santé of Auteuil. I found him there, and left him there. No body knew when he came,—he had been there from time immemorial; nor when he was going away,—for he himself did not know; —nor what ailed him,—for though he was always complaining, yet he grew neither better nor worse, never consulted the physician, and ate voraciously three times a day. At table he was rather peevish, troubled his neighbors with his elbows, and uttered the monosyllable pish! rather oftener than good-breeding and a due deference to the opinions of others seemed to justify. As soon as he seated himself at table he breathed into his tumbler, and wiped it out with a napkin; then wiped his plate, his spoon, his knife and fork, in succession, and each with great care. After this he placed the napkin under his chin, by way of bib and tucker, and, these preparations being completed, gave full swing to an appetite, which was not inappropriately denominated, by one of our guests, une faim canine. The old gentleman's weak side was an affectation of youth and gallantry. Though “written down old, with all the characters of age,” yet at times he seemed to think himself in the hey-day of life; and the assiduous court he paid to a fair Countess, who was passing the summer at the Maison de Santé, was the source of no little merriment to all but himself. He loved, too, to recall the golden age of his amours; and would discourse with prolix eloquence, and a faint twinkle in his watery eye, of his bonnes fortunes in times of old, and the rigors, that many a fair dame had suffered on his account. Indeed, his chief pride seemed to be to make his hearers believe, that he had been a dangerous man in his youth, and was not yet quite safe. As I also was a peripatetic of the garden, we encountered each other at every turn. At first our conversation was limited to the usual salutations of the day; but ere long our casual acquaintance ripened into a kind of intimacy. Step by step I won my way,—first into his society,—then into his snuff-box,—and then into his heart. He was a great talker, and he found in me, what he found in no other inmate of the house,—a good listener, who never interrupted his long stories, nor contradicted his opinions. So he talked down one alley and up another,— from breakfast till dinner,—from dinner till midnight;—at all times and in all places, when he could catch me by the button, till at last he had confided to my ear all the important and unimportant events of a life of sixty years. Monsieur D'Argentville was a shoot from a wealthy family of Nantes. Just before the Revolution he went up to Paris to study law at the University; and like many other wealthy scholars of his age, was soon involved in the intrigues and dissipation of the metropolis. He first established himself in the Rue de l'Université; but a roguish pair of eyes, at an opposite window, soon drove from the field such heavy tacticians as Hugues Doneau and Gui Coquille. A flirtation was commenced in due form; and a flag of truce, offering to capitulate, was sent in the shape of a billet-doux. In the mean time he regularly amused his leisure hours by blowing kisses across the street with an old pair of bellows. One afternoon, as he was occupied in this way, a tall gentleman with whiskers stepped into the room, just as he had charged the bellows to the muzzle. He muttered something about an explanation—his sister—marriage—and the satisfaction of a gentleman! Perhaps there is no situation in life so awkward to a man of real sensibility, as that of being awed into matrimony or a duel by the whiskers of a tall brother. There was but one alternative; and the next morning a placard at the window of the Bachelor of Love, with the words “Furnished Appartment to let,” showed that the former occupant had found it convenient to change lodgings. He next appeared in the Chaussée-d'Antin, where he assiduously prepared himself for future exigencies, by a course of daily lessons in the use of the small-sword. He soon after quarrelled with his best friend, about a little actress on the Boulevard, and had the satisfaction of being jilted, and then run through the body at the Bois de Boulogne. This gave him new eclat in the fashionable world; and consequently he pursued pleasure with a keener relish than ever. He next had the grande passion, and narrowly escaped marrying an heiress of great expectations, and a countless number of chateaux. Just before the catastrophe, however, he had the good fortune to discover, that the lady's expectations were limited to his own pocket, and that as for her chateaux, they were all Chateaux en Espagne. About this time his father died; and the hopeful son was hardly well established in his 11 inheritance, when the Revolution broke out. Unfortunately he was a firm upholder of the divine right of kings, and had the honor of being among the first of the proscribed. He narrowly escaped the guillotine by jumping on board a vessel bound for America, and arrived at Boston with only a few francs in his pocket; but as he knew how to accommodate himself to circumstances, he continued to live along by teaching fencing and French, and keeping a dancing-school and a milliner. At the restoration of the Bourbons he returned to France; and from that time to the day of our acquaintance had been engaged in a series of vexatious law-suits, in the hope of recovering a portion of his property, which had been entrusted to a friend for safe keeping, at the commencement of the Revolution. His friend, however, denied all knowledge of the transaction, and the assignment was very difficult to prove. Twelve years of unsuccessful litigation had completely soured the old gentleman's temper, and made him peevish and misanthropic; and he had come to Auteuil, merely to escape the noise of the city, and to brace his shattered nerves with pure air and quiet amusements. There he idled the time away, sauntering about the garden of the Maison de Santé, talking to himself, when he could get no other listener, and occasionally reinforcing his misanthropy with a dose of the Maxims of La Rochefoucauld, or a visit to the scene of his duel in the Bois de Bologne. Poor Monsieur D'Argentville! What a miserable life he led—or rather dragged on from day to day!—A petulant, broken-down old man, who had outlived his fortune, and his friends, and his hopes,—yea, every thing but the sting of bad passions, and the recollection of a life ill-spent!—Whether he still walks the earth, or slumbers in its bosom, I know not; but a lively recollection of him will always mingle with my reminiscences of Auteuil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PÈRE LA CHAISE. Death levels all things in his march; Nought can resist his mighty strength; The palace proud,—triumphal arch, Shall mete their shadow's length. The rich, the poor, one common bed Shall find in the unhonoured grave, Where weeds shall crown alike the head Of tyrant and of slave. Marvel. PÈRE LA CHAISE. Our fathers find their graves in our short memories, and sadly tell us how we may be buried in our survivors. Oblivion is not to be hired. The greater part must be content to be as though they had not been, to be found in the register of God, not in the record of man. Sir Thomas Brown's Urn-Burial. The cemetery of Père La Chaise is the Westminster Abbey of Paris. Both are the dwellings of the dead; but in one they repose in green alleys and beneath the open sky;—in the other their resting place is in the shadowy aisle and beneath the dim arches of an ancient abbey. One is a temple of nature— the other a temple of art. In one the soft melancholy of the scene is rendered still more touching by the warble of birds and the shade of trees, and the grave receives the gentle visit of the sunshine and the shower;—in the other no sound but the passing foot-fall breaks the silence of the place; the twilight steals in through high and dusky windows; and the damps of the gloomy vault lie heavy on the heart, and leave their stain upon the mouldering tracery of the tomb. Père La Chaise stands just beyond the Barrière d' Aulney, on a hill side, looking towards the city. Numerous gravel walks, winding through shady avenues and between marble monuments, lead up from the principal entrance to a chapel on the summit. There is hardly a grave that has not its little enclosure planted with shrubbery; and a thick mass of foliage half conceals each funeral stone. The sighing of the wind, as the branches rise and fall upon it,—the occasional note of a bird among the trees, and the shifting of light and shade upon the tombs beneath, have a soothing effect upon the mind; and I doubt whether any one can enter that enclosure, where repose the dust and ashes of so many great and good men, without feeling the religion of the place steal over him, and seeing something of the dark and gloomy expression pass off from the stern countenance of death. It was near the close of a bright summer afternoon, that I visited this celebrated spot for the first time. The first object, that arrested my attention on entering, was a monument in the form of a small gothic chapel, which stands near the entrance, in the avenue leading to the right hand. On the marble couch within are stretched two figures carved in stone, and dressed in the antique garb of the Middle Ages. It is the tomb of Abélard and Héloïse. The history of these unfortunate lovers is too well known to need recapitulation; but perhaps it is not so well known how often their ashes were disturbed in the slumber of the grave. Abélard died in the monastery of Saint-Marcel, and was buried in the vaults of the church. His body was afterwards removed to the convent of the Paraclet, at the request of Héloïse, and at her death her body was deposited in the same tomb. Three centuries they reposed together; after which they were separated to different sides of the church to calm the delicate scruples of the lady Abbess of the convent. More than a century afterwards, they were again united in the same tomb; and when at length the Paraclet was destroyed, their mouldering remains were transported to the church of Nogent-sur-Seine. They were next deposited in an ancient cloister at Paris; and now repose near the gate-way of the cemetery of Père La Chaise. What a singular destiny was theirs!—that after a life of such passionate and disastrous love—such sorrows, and tears, and penitence—their very dust should not be suffered to rest quietly in the grave! that their death should so much resemble their life in its changes and vicissitudes—its partings and its meetings,—its inquietudes and its persecutions! that mistaken zeal should follow them down to the very tomb,—as if earthly passion could glimmer, like a funeral lamp, amid the damps of the charnel-house, and “even in their ashes burn their wonted fires!” As I gazed on the sculptured forms before me, and the little chapel, whose gothic roof seemed to protect their marble sleep, my busy memory swung back the dark portals of the past, and the picture of their sad and eventful lives came up before me in the gloomy distance. What a lesson for those who are endowed 12 with the fatal gift of genius!—It would seem, indeed, that he who “tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,” tempers also his chastisements to the errors and infirmities of a weak and simple mind,—while the transgressions of him upon whose nature are more strongly marked the intellectual attributes of the deity, are followed, even upon earth, by severer tokens of the divine displeasure. He who sins in the darkness of a benighted intellect, sees not so clearly, through the shadows that surround him, the countenance of an offended God;— but he who sins in the broad noon-day of a clear and radiant mind, when at length the delirium of sensual passion has subsided, and the cloud flits away from before the sun, trembles beneath the searching eye of that accusing power, which is strong in the strength of a godlike intellect. Thus the mind and the heart are closely linked together, and the errors of genius bear with them their own chastisement, even upon earth. The history of Abélard and Héloïse is an illustration of this truth. But at length they sleep well. Their lives are like a tale that is told; their errors are “folded up like a book;” and what mortal hand shall break the seal that death has set upon them! Leaving this interesting tomb behind me, I took a path-way to the left which conducted me up the hill-side. I soon found myself in the deep shade of heavy foliage, where the branches of the yew and willow mingled, interwoven with the tendrils and blossoms of the honey-suckle. I now stood in the most populous part of this city of tombs. Every step awakened a new train of thrilling recollections; for at every step my eye caught the name of some one, whose glory had exalted the character of his native land, and resounded across the waters of the Atlantic. Philosophers, historians, musicians, warriors, and poets slept side by side around me; some beneath the gorgeous monument, and some beneath the simple head-stone. There were the graves of Fourcroi and Haüy;—of Ginguené and Volney;—of Grêtry and Méhul;—of Ney, and Foy, and Masséna;—of La Fontaine, and Molière, and Chénier, and Delille, and Parny. But the political intrigue, the dream of science, the historical research, the ravishing harmony of sound, the tried courage, the inspiration of the lyre,—where are they? With the living, and not with the dead! The right hand has lost its cunning in the grave; but the soul, whose high volitions it obeyed, still lives to reproduce itself in ages yet to come. Among these graves of genius, I observed here and there a splendid monument, which had been raised by the pride of family, over the dust of men, who could lay no claim either to the gratitude or remembrance of posterity. Their presence seemed like an intrusion into the sanctuary of genius. What had wealth to do there? Why should it crowd the dust of the great! That was no thoroughfare of business—no mart of gain! There were no costly banquets there; no silken garments, nor gaudy liveries, nor obsequious attendants! “What servants,” says Jeremy Taylor, “shall we have to wait upon us in the grave? What friends to visit us? What officious people to cleanse away the moist and unwholesome cloud reflected upon our faces from the sides of the weeping vaults, which are the longest weepers for our funerals?” Material wealth gives a factitious superiority to the living, but the treasures of intellect give a real superiority to the dead; and the rich man, who would not deign to walk the street with the starving and penniless man of genius, deems it an honor, when death has redeemed the fame of the neglected, to have his own ashes laid beside him, and to claim with him the silent companionship of the grave. I continued my walk through the numerous winding paths, as chance or curiosity directed me. Now I was lost in a little green hollow, overhung with thick-leaved shrubbery, and then came out upon an elevation, from which, through an opening in the trees, the eye caught glimpses of the city, and the little esplanade at the foot of the hill, where the poor lie buried. There poverty hires its grave, and takes but a short lease of the narrow house. At the end of a few months, or at most of a few years, the tenant is dislodged to give place to another, and he in turn to a third. “Who,” says Sir Thomas Browne, “knows the fate of his bones, or how often he is to be buried? who hath the oracle of his ashes, or whither they are to be scattered?” Yet, even in that neglected corner, the hand of affection had been busy in decorating the hired house. Most of the graves were surrounded with a slight wooden paling, to secure them from the passing footstep;—there was hardly one so deserted as not to be marked with its little wooden cross, and decorated with a garland of flowers; and here and there I could perceive a solitary mourner, clothed in black, stooping to plant a shrub on the grave, or sitting in motionless sorrow beside it. As I passed on amid the shadowy avenues of the cemetery, I could not help comparing my own impressions, with those which others have felt when walking alone among the dwellings of the dead. Are, then, the sculptured urn and storied monument nothing more than symbols of family pride? Is all I see around me a memorial of the living more than of the dead?—an empty show of sorrow, which thus vaunts itself in mournful pageant and funeral parade? Is it indeed true, as some have said, that the simple wild-flower, which springs spontaneously upon the grave, and the rose, which the hand of affection plants there, are fitter objects wherewith to adorn the narrow house? No!—I feel that it is not so! Let the good and the great be honored even in the grave. Let the sculptured marble direct our footsteps to the scene of their long sleep; let the chiselled epitaph repeat their names, and tell us where repose the nobly good and wise! It is not true that all are equal in the grave. There is no equality even there. The mere handful of dust and ashes—the mere distinction of prince and beggar—of a rich winding-sheet and a shroudless burial—of a solitary grave and a family vault—were this all—then indeed it would be true that death is a common leveller. Such paltry distinctions as those of wealth and poverty are soon levelled by the spade and mattoc; the damp breath of the grave blots them out forever. But there are other distinctions which even the mace of death cannot level or obliterate. Can it break down the distinction of virtue and vice? Can it confound the good with the bad? the noble with the base? all that is truly great, and pure and godlike, with all that is scorned, and sinful, and degraded! No! Then death is not a common leveller! Are all alike beloved in death and honored in their burial? Is that ground holy where the bloody hand of the murderer sleeps from crime? Does every grave awaken the same emotions in our hearts? and do the foot-steps of the stranger pause as long beside each funeral stone? No! Then all are not equal in the grave! And as long as the good and evil deeds of men live after them, so long will there be distinctions even in the grave. The superiority of one over another is in the nobler and better emotions which it excites; in its more fervent admonitions to virtue; in the livelier recollection, which it awakens, of the good and the great, whose bodies are crumbling to dust beneath our feet! If, then, there are distinctions in the grave, surely it is not unwise to designate them by the external marks of honor. These outward appliances and memorials of respect,—the mournful urn,—the sculptured bust,—the epitaph eloquent in praise,—cannot indeed create these distinctions, but they serve to mark them. It is only when pride or wealth builds them to honor the slave of mammon, or the slave of appetite, when the voice from the grave rebukes the false and pompous epitaph, and the dust and ashes of the tomb seem struggling to maintain the superiority of mere worldly rank, and to carry into the grave the baubles of earthly vanity,—it is then, and then only, that we feel how utterly worthless are all the devices of sculpture, and the empty pomp of monumental brass! After rambling leisurely about for some time, reading the inscriptions on the various monuments, which attracted my curiosity, and giving way to the different reflections they suggested, I sat down to rest myself on a sunken tombstone. A winding gravel-walk, overshaded by an avenue of trees, and lined on both sides with richly sculptured monuments, had gradually conducted me to the summit of the hill, upon whose slope the cemetery stands. Beneath me in the distance, and dim-discovered through the misty and smoky atmosphere of evening, rose the countless roofs and spires of the city. Beyond, throwing his level rays athwart the dusky landscape, sank the broad red sun. The distant murmur of the city rose 13 upon my ear; and the toll of the evening bell came up, mingled with the rattle of the paved street and the confused sounds of labor. What an hour for meditation! What a contrast between the metropolis of the living and the metropolis of the dead! I could not help calling to my mind that allegory of mortality, written by a hand, which has been many a long year cold; Earth goeth upon earth as man upon mould, Like as earth upon earth never go should, Earth goeth upon earth as glistening gold, And yet shall earth unto earth rather than he would. Lo, earth on earth, consider thou may, How earth cometh to earth naked alway, Why shall earth upon earth go stout or gay, Since earth out of earth shall pass in poor array.2 2. I subjoin this relic of old English verse entire, and in its antiquated language, for those of my readers, who may have an antiquarian taste. It is copied from a book, whose title I have forgotten, and of which I have but a single leaf, containing the poem. In describing the antiquities of the church of Stratford-upon-Avon, the writer gives the following account of a very old painting upon the wall, and of the poem, which served as its motto. The painting is no longer visible, having been effaced in repairing the church. “Against the west wall of the nave, on the south side of the arch, was painted the martyrdom of Thomas-a-Becket, whilst kneeling at the altar of St. Benedict in Canterbury cathedral; below this was the figure of an angel, probably St. Michael, supporting a long scroll, upon which were seven stanzas in old English, being an allegory of mortality; Erthe oute of erthe ys wondurly wroght Erth hath gotyn uppon erth a dygnyte of noght Erth ypon erth hath sett all hys thowht How erth apon erth may be hey browght Erth upon erth wold be a kyng But how that erth gott to erth he thyngkys nothyng When erth byddys erth hys rentys whom bryng Then schall erth apon erth have a hard ptyng Erth apon erth wynnys castellys and towrys Then seth erth unto erth thys ys all owrys When erth apon eath hath bylde hys bowrys Then schall erth for erth suffur many hard schowrys Erth goth apon erth as man apon mowld Lyke as erth apon erth never goo schold Erth goth apon erth as gelsteryng gold And yet schall erth unto erth rather then he wold Why that erth loveth erth wondur me thynke Or why that erth wold for erth other swett or swynke When erth apon erth ys broght wt.yn the brynke Then schall erth apon erth have a fowll stynke Lo erth on erth consedur thow may How erth comyth to erth nakyd all way Why schall erth apon erth goo stowte or gay Seth erth owt of erth schall passe yn poor aray I counsill erth apon erth that ys wondurly wrogt The whyl yt. erth ys apon erth to torne hys thowht And pray to god upon erth yt. all erth wroght That all crystyn soullys to ye. blys.may be broght Beneath were two men, holding a scroll over a body wrapt in a winding sheet, and covered with some emblems of mortality; etc.” Before I left the grave-yard, the shades of evening had fallen, and the objects around me grown dim and indistinct. As I passed the gate-way, I turned to take a parting look. I could distinguish only the chapel on the summit of the hill, and here and there a lofty obelisk of snow-white marble, rising from the black and heavy mass of foliage around, and pointing upward to the gleam of the departed sun, that still lingered in the sky, and mingled with the soft star-light of a summer evening.</field>
