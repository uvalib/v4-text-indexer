      <field name="fulltext">HENRY HOWARD. CHAPTER I. Henry Howard, the hero of our tale, was a young Bostonian of fortune and education, endowed by nature with a fine person and unexceptionable address, character and position in society. At the period of our tale he was twenty-seven years of age, and when, besides his youth, his other advantages just enumerated are taken into consideration, it is not surprising that the bright eyes and gentle regards of more than one marriageable belle were turned towards him. But in spite of their charms, Henry passed unscathed through the winter assemblies and the summerings at Saratoga and Nahant, each autumn's return finding him as free as the spring had found him. But our hero was not a marrying man! That is, he had no mind, as he said, to sacrifice his independence to a wife's silken restraints. He found some others of his particular friends in the same liberty-loving mood, and one convivial evening a few months prior to the opening of our story, they combined to stand together in a war of resistance against matrimony! This anti-marrying club consisted besides Henry, of five others, all of them young men of high respectability, and all equally opposed to the nuptial bondage. They held their meetings once a week, and over wine and cigars strengthened each other's resolutions, and rejoiced in their mutual independence of Hymen. Our hero no doubt thought that this compact would render him forever secure from the toils of matrimony, and that, armed with the panoply of his resolutions, he might safely trust himself amid the blaze of beauty and bid defiauce to the archery of Don Cupid. But the little love-God had no idea of suffering a conspiracy of this kind to exist against his legitimate power; and placing himself within the bright eyes of a charming girl named Louise Lintot, she shot a shower of arrows from behind her eye lashes, as from the covert of a chevaur de frise, and penetrated his heart in a hundred places! The result was, that Henry found himself over head in ears in love, and after in vain trying to subdue and conquer the passion, he submitted to it, and forgetting his resolutions and his club, he made a declaration at the feet of his lovely conqueror! This event took place at Portland, that city renowned for female grace and beauty, where Harry was on a visit at the time, and so beyond the immediate protection of his brothers in the vow; if it had been in Boston, their presence and the fear of their ridicule possibly might have restrained him from going so far. But the first they heard of it was from the following letter, written by him to his friend, Charles Lester, the most inveterate of the anti-matrimonialists, with whom he had been touring, until Charles and his other friends left him in Portland to proceed to Boston; for the party of anti-conjugalists had been travelling together to the White Mountains. It will be seen, by the letter, that Harry resolved to be precipitate and to get through with the matter before he could receive any remonstrances from his friends: Portland, August — 184-. My dear Charles, Within a week, my dear friend, I shall be a married man! I can see you burst into a fit of the loudest laughter at this unexpected revelation! Joke me as much as you please, my friend; remind me of my bitter diatribes against matrimony, and of the oaths by which I, with you, bound ourselves never to augment the list of its victims!— But how has it turned out? I surely have not changed my opinion; I only act contrary from what I think! Shall I be the first one whose actions have been in complete opposition to his words, or, at least, who has not the courage to sustain his opinion? You already know that my past history has been romantic and adventurous enough to make me a fit hero for a novel or a comedy! What I am about to relate will not lessen in your mind this idea. I will not say that Louise is beautiful! for you yourself saw her when here, and she appeared to you so perfect, that when you parted from me at the depot you recommended to me careful vigilance over myself! I have struggled like a hero! but I have finally yielded to my fate, and in imitation of the ancient paladin knights, I have chosen to surrender my arms to the most formidable of my enemies, MATRIMONY. Thus in my fall, I have fallen with honor! Indeed and in truth, my friend, it was impossible for me to resist!— I will not bring into account by way of extenuation of my fault, the lively desire of my poor father, who was highly displeased on discovering my anti-conjugal ideas. This consideration, although powerful, would not have been sufficient to determine me to this step; but I love Louise! I confess it to my disgrace that what filial love and the tears of my father could not achieve has been brought about effectually by my own passion, by the egotistical desire of my own personal felicity. In vain have I invoked and arrayed against my weakness, the remembrance of our convivial, anti-conjugal meeting, and recalled to my aid the ardent and once sincere repugnances I once entertained with you and among you! In deed and in truth, my dear Charles, I still do most cordially hate matrimony, but I love Louise more! I have just written to my father, asking his consent. I question whether his business added to his obstinate gout will suffer him to come and bring it to me in person. But I am quite confident he will not long delay a reply. There is one thing that is in my favour. Louise is the daughter of his most intimate friend, and, as you are aware, being an orphan my father had taken a deep intesest in her. It was, I begin to mistrust, a trap of his to get me to call on her with the letter of introduction he gave me! If so, I can only say I am fairly taken captive! My father, I know, is greatly attached to her; for I have often heard him speak of her with the most paternal interest! Therefore I know that in marrying her I am going to make my excellent parent happy! The idea of his joy consoles me something for the sadness—yes, for the sadness which a certain discontent of myself causes me in the midst of my happiness! Truly and frankly, Charles, I am the most miserable man that ever was known. I am about to marry freely and voluntarily, and if Louise should come to me and say, `No longer do I love you!' I should be in utter dispair and misery, and be tempted to blow out my brains! Nevertheless, the idea of matrimony makes my turn pale, and before taking the first vacillating step I — Ah! my Charles! I feel a faintness seize me at the heart. I have already shown myself a coward in retreating from the firm resolution never to marry: and I will not now be one also in now refusing to marry! I have had a bad head-ache and must close. Fortunately my heart is firm. Adieu. HARRY HOWARD. P. S Just as I had signed the foregoing letter, the consent of my father arrived, and I at once hastened to convey it to Louise. You will suppose that the interview was as tender as the circumstances required! Nothing like this. On her receiving the news I observed glancing from underneath her eye-lashes certain glances of secret triumph that confounded and alarmed me! It appeared to me to be a wicked joy! In imagination I saw her writing to all her female friends, invariably beginning every letter, `I am married!' Then follows a thousand comments, and at the end I saw myself figuring in this style, `P. S. I had almost forgotten to tell you something about my husband!' `Yet ought I not to be flattered by even such a notice? If indeed Louise loves my person, I think she ought to be happy with my love which no ceremony will increase! How then, or why then should I manifest joy when I see myself on the verge of a union which will not make me love her more than I do now? Will it not be that, like all the rest, she will be more pleased with the matrimony than with the husband! This idea has tormented me atrociously, and has given a lukewarmness to our interviews. I know this idea is a foolish one, be cause I cannot doubt of the purity and of the reality of the love of Louise for me. But I am tortured, I hardly know wherefore. I am agitated while I write, and feel a fever in my veins. If you were at my side, Charles, I think I should hardly dare to be married. [A letter from Mr. Howard, the father of our hero to Miss Lintot.] Boston, August—184—. `How can I thank you, my dear daughter — for in anticipation I give you this name! What a fine triumph for you to have reduced my son to a treaty to which, I know not from what false and ridiculous ideas, he has been so adverse. I assure you that he has cost me great solicitude, and in conquering him you have restored to me happiness and life. I have loved you as a daughter of an old and dear friend; but now I shall love in you equally my daughter and the tutelar angel of my son. I will write you again soon, Your affectionate friend and father, E. HOWARD. [A letter from Charles Lester, to Henry Howard.] Dear Harry, You, yourself, have said it! you are a coward. But you have told me no news. When we left Portland I presayed your fall; and in order to reinforce your courage, if it was yet time, (for I saw how it went with you the moment you sat eyes on Miss Lintot!) or in order to make more open and apparent your perjury, I invited thee to a banquet where alone were admitted bachelors: bachelors, you will understand. It was at the Cumberland Hotel! We were six! enemies all of matrimony! and when, at that time, I hinted, in jest, that you would be our first deserter, you cried out, exclaiming loudly, `Calumny!' and when we alleged, in proof, your passion (apparent to all) for Louise Lintot, you denied it, saying, `If I could be so base as to let love for woman cause me to break my word, then should I deserve to be broken upon the wheel as I break this glass!..' and the fragments of the crystal fell upon the table in the midst of the thunder of our applause! Our oaths, those oaths of which you speak in your letter, were then renewed with all due solemnity, and when the champagne appeared, you sang the popular song, `Liberty, dear liberty! man's best and highest gift!' and we repeated and re-echoed the chorus with formidable enthusiasm. Of the six friends that joined that day their hands and their pledges, four are, at this moment, while I am writing you, seated in my room, and your letter has given us a subject to laugh at for a whole rainy day! As for the sixth, his marriage bans are being published and he is getting ready his wedding garments! Ah, what a fall is there. Harry! if you are a man, break through every thing, take the cars the very evening you get this letter, come to us and repeat the oaths of the first of July. If not, leave us and we will compose a dirge for thee, and at our next meeting chant it over the vacant chair you once occupied in our midst. Requiescat in pace. CHARLES LESTER. CHAPTER II. We now give a letter from the heroine of our tale, to her particular friend Miss Florence Weldon, of Boston. Portland, August 20, 184-. `I have scarcely time, my dear friend to write you a few lines. To-morrow will be celebrated my marriage! The ceremony will be limited to a few friends to be present in the church; as this privacy will be more appropriate with my condition as an orphan, especially so, as the parents of my husband will not be present. I have already told you that Henry, on the subject of matrimony, was a most incorrigible rebel, whom it has been my good fortune to compel to submission.— Yet he shows still, from time to time, symptoms of insurrection; but his love for me represses them. `Here ends the last letter you will ever receive from Louise Lintot! Mrs. Howard will write you to-morrow, although it may be no more than a word after the ceremony has been performed. Yours truly, LOUISE LINTOT. [From the same to the same, one day later.] Portland, Aug. 21, 184-. `I know not how I can write you, neither how I can be alive after the abominable scene which has just taken place. I have but now returned from church! — Insult most cruel and mortifying! Soon I will write all to you, Florence: I have now only strength to weep!— Your distressed, LOUISE. [Henry Howard to his friend Charles Lester.] Portland, Aug. 21. (5, P. M.) `You have triumphed, Charles! but at what a sacrifice! I tremble to contemplate it! Yes, I have conquered the enemy; I have triumphed over matrimony, like a true knight, I have yielded on the very field of battle. If I have been fairly slain, it is not my fault! Listen to my dream, for such you will see it is;—Yesterday I received your letter precisely at the hour at which we were to proceed to church. Your cool raillery penetrated my heart, depositing there a chilling frost, deadening the warm glow of my love! Did I need this new instigation, when, tortured by my memories and resolutions, I was already wavering. The hour fixed for the ceremony was as dark as my new suit of black broadcloth, and I seemed to be attired for my own burial! Did I need your letter, Charles? Louise at length appeared attired in virgin white; yet I scarcely glanced towards her. I thought upon my dear independence, upon the infinite delights of the life of a bachelor; and of innumerable in estimable privileges which never appeared to me so valuable till just as I was about to lose them forever! On crossing the vestibule of the Church, I thought I eould see you five laughing at my expense; and when the clergymaR began to read the words of the ceremony, I found myself again in imagination one of the banquet of six! Till then, absorbed in my reflections, I had stood and listened mechanically; but when the clergyman put to me directly and roundly the question, I had to rouse myself from my lethargy in order to hear and respond. `Henry will you have this woman to be thy wedded wife, to live together after God's holy ordinance, in the holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor, and keep her, in sickness and health; and, forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live?' When he put this formidable compound of interrogatories to me, I stood confounded and felt that my destiny was consummated! The repugnance with which the scandal and infamy of a negation inspired me was struggling in my heart with the idea of compromising myself irrevocably with an affirmation. In this terrible state of agitation I stood silent, while a cold sweat bathed in huge drops my forehead. I was going to look at Louise in order to inspire myself with the courage necessary to say `Yes!'—when suddenly I heard a street organ without playing an air that made me start, while the clear voice of the organist sang the song we had sung at our banquet: `Liberty, dear Liberty!' It was a powerful, irresistable appeal? I turned round my head to the priest and firmly responded, `No!' What subsequently occurred I have scarcely any distinct recollection of. I saw nothing—heard nothing! Before those present could recover from their first surprise I had flown from the church—flown like a criminal! I traversed street after street without any definite purpose, and scarcely knowing where I was going. But, at length, composed by the open air and having in some degree walked off my excitement, I comprehended that it was necessary I should at once leave the town. I turned my steps towards the depot, but found on my arrival there that the cars had already left. I then hastened back to my hotel after two hours wanderings, and have taken my pen to address you and let you know what has occurred! Ah, Charles, do not too much applaud my valor, for I have lacerated my heart! I love Louise! I love her more than ever, and I see that I have lost her forever! Henceforward an impassible abyss will separate us — the remembrance of an infamous injury, an unpardonable affront! I have destroyed the peace and happiness of this poor girl who has been guilty of no other fault than loving me! I am very miserable! It is necessary that I leave this city; although it will be only to transfer my wretchedness without removing it. I am coming to see you in Boston, if I can! If I can! because, shall I have courage and resolution to exile myself from the air which Louise breathes! she, alas, from whom I am exiled forever! HENRY HOWARD. [A letter from Mr. Howard, the father of our hero, to Miss Lintot.] Boston, 22d August. Last night, I learned, my daughter, the horrible scene in the church, and I have suffered so much, I have shed so many tears for you, that it has been impossible for me to write to you earlier. My son is a vile and despicable being! Not only has he deceived you in the most infamous manner, but he has also deceived me, his father, knowing well that this ignoble conduct would destroy my last hope, and shorten my life. From this time I have no son; because the person to whom I have this name is a miserable insensate and a detestable parricide!— But you remain to me, my child, you to whom I have been accustomed to give the sweet name of daughter. The air of the place where you are, filled, as it must be, with memories which will be poisonous to the wounds yet fresh in the heart, will prove injurious to you. Come, then, to my house; come and seek the old friend of your father. I invite you, not only for your own sake, but also I ask it for my own advantage. Come, then, with your aunt, if you do not wish to be separated from her; or if you prefer going into the country, say so, and I will close my business and in spite of the bad state of my health, I will go with you wherever you command. Alas! I that hoped in this union a felicity so great, so perfect! let me, Louise, enjoy at least a part of it! Your friend and parent, E. HOWARD. [A letter from Miss Lintot, to her friend Florence Weldon.] Portland, Aug. 30, 184-. `I am to-day more tranquil, my dear Florence, and I now feel that if the conduct of Mr. Howard towards me has been most odious, his heart is less culpable! His head has been elevated in one of those crimes of rebellion which I have indicated to you. If, in the moment of the fatal question, his hand had been in mine, only a `yes' would have gone from his lips. But his disordered imagination had carried him a hundred miles off from me at the moment: materially he was but a step from me; morally but half a second from matrimony! The terror of matrimony was, at the instant, more powerful than his love for me, and he said `NO.' But well am I avenged! Never has he given such proofs of his tenderness as now! He looks pale and wan as if just convalescing from a long sickness. Twice a day he has written me excuses the most humble, mingled with protestations the most ardent. Not daring to present himself at the house, well knowing he would not be received, he has taken rooms directly opposite the way, where I see him seated all day, myself invisible, with his eyes constantly fixed upon my closed windows. I have learned that three times he has taken tickets in the cars for Boston, and three times his resolution has failed him and he has remained. How he loves me! How happy we should have been! His father is in despair; and writes me letters that make my heart bleed. Oh, my friend, what a chance has he thrown away! Your attached LOUISE LINTOT. [A letter from Charles Lester, to Henry Howard.] Boston, Aug. 31. My dear Harry, What has become of you? We have been daily looking for your arrival and still we neither see nor hear from you! If you had blown your brains out, we know the papers would give the intelligence and particulars of the horrible catastrophe. But, as they are silent, the presumption is that you are still living. So I write to you, not as to a dead man, but one in good bodily condition. Pray, what has become of you? We have had several club-meetings at which we expected your presence. Your courage in saying no we have all commended and cannot give you too much praise. It is a pity it was not given before you got to church; for to have one of our number so nearly meshed as to escape only from the very altar, reflects something upon the stability and good faith of the rest of us. I write this to assure you, that unless you report yourself to the club before three days expire, we shall take the cars in a body and come for you; for know you, we already begin to have doubts of your constancy; and fear that your feelings of remorse may lead you to penitence and ultimate submission.— We have voted you President of our club, and we believe you will render yourself worthy of our confidence. Your friend, CHARLES LESTER. CHAPTER III. In the continuation of our story, which we have written after the manner of a Spanish tale with a similar title, we shall proceed to give our readers a letter from the father of Henry Howard to Miss Lintot; as, in this way, we can better illustrate events than by giving them in the usual order of narration. Boston, September 3d, 184-. My Daughter, I have just received a letter from the unhappy Henry! I will confess to you, that, in spite of my just anger against him, it has moved me profoundly. He repents of his conduct with the liveliest contrition, does you merited justice, and is in fine under such deep affliction that he has awakened my pity and sympathy in his behalf. He says he cannot leave Portland until he has first received from your mouth that pardon which is now the only object of his desires. He rightly conceives that you will not wish to see him; but, notwithstanding, if to give him some degree of repose, a single word of yours would suffice, which, perhaps, he merits by his expiation, would you obstinately refuse it? I do not advise you, my daughter.—You have too much judgment and prudence not to know precisely what is necessary in a juncture so delicate. Consult your own sense of what is right. But think, that upon your determination will hang, perhaps, the moral cure of that poor youth who, if he cannot be to me the source of the felicity I had hoped for, may not be to me so bitter a cause of affliction. Who can tell? that this interview may not be a prelude to a reconciliation! Pardon me, Miss Lintot my unreasonable hope may appear to you ridiculous; but it is that of a father who loves you tenderly and who prays for the privilege of being able to love him with you. I confide in your heart, my daughter! Your friend and parent, E. HOWARD. [Louise Lintot to Florence Weldon.] Portland, Sept. 8. `What a noble heart has Henry! How his very defects, themselves, reveal qualities, that badly directed, have led to the gravest of faults, but well directed would have made a wife happy. All that is wanting in him to make him the best of husbands is decision! It is already clear to me that he has been impelled to this inconceivable negative by an excess of loyalty and frankness.—Foolish notions have inspired him with fear of matrimony, fear which he knows not how to shake off. He loves me: I am sure that he loves me with all his heart. Without me his life will be miserable and desolate; but through the effect of habit that word matrimony inspires him with fear, and he does not wish to consign to me a heart where I reign, because this feeling of doubt exists, though only in his imagination. Only that marriage is necessary, he would live at my side as a husband most tender and loving but matrimony exists! It were certainly a deed of charity to cure him, as much on his own account, as he will always be miserable, as for his father's sake whom I love as if he were my own. Mr. Howard has hinted to me that if I desire I can easily tie the knot broken once by the imprudence of Harry. — I see that this may be possible: but the difficulty is in undertaking it. As with you, Florence, I am frank, I confess to you that the will is not wanting on my part; and if Henry should say to me to-day: `Forget the past, pardon my faults and give me an opportunity to repair them,' perhaps, from friendship to his father, through charity to him, I would let him conduct me anew to the presence of the clergyman. But this he has not yet done; and for reasons I pointed out at the beginning of this letter, I think will not do! He cannot find happiness without marrying me; but he is not yet reconciled to me, and if he were, he might not so soon be with the idea of matrimony. It is a rare case; but it is as you see! His letters are as expansive, as loving as I could desire; but he does not explain himself categorically; nor does he propose anything. Now you see how peculiar my situation is, wishing to act without the power! I will meditate upon the matter; for it would be so gratifying to me to do a favor to that good Mr. Howard, his father.' LOUISE LINTOT. [A Letter from Miss Lintot to her friend Florence Weldon.] Portland, Sept. 16. I have taken a great step, from which I am yet in a very disturbed state. Mr. Howard, Henry's father, full of ingenuity to affect the reconciliation which he has so much at heart, enclosed to his son a letter for me, with instructions to hand it to me in person! It was for the purpose of affording the poor youth a pretext for taking a step for which he had not the necessary courage. He came, and in the absence, or with the consent of the servant, entered my presence and tremblingly presented the letter of his father: `Miss Lintot,' he said, `your silence and disdain are but a light punishment for my abominable fault. Yet, must my punishment be eternal? Will my repentance never disarm your displeasure? I was not worthy of being your husband; but, setting aside matrimony and love, cannot we be friends? Since with my heart or without it, you would not dare to surrender yourself as the wife of a man prejudiced against matrimony, and since for this reason he has renounced your love, does it necessarily follow, (the manner of my rejection being forgiven) that we ought always to be separated from each other, antagonists, when our characters sympathise so perfectly?' I was moved and cast down my eyes. He continued: `Pardon me, Louise, and give me permission to visit you! Inasmuch as my conscience may not be reconciled with matrimony, I swear to you that you shall never hear from my lips a word that a sister may not hear from her brother! Do you doubt? He, who loving as I have loved you, has had the strength to sacrifice his love to exaggerate scruples, ridiculous if you choose to call them, will he not have strength, if not to conquer it, at least, to prevent its outbreak? Permit me, Louise, permit me, for the love of Heaven, to see you sometimes! To deny me will be to consign me again to the horrible madness which I have endured for the last eight and twenty days, and which has only left me since I have been in your presence. Louise, reflect, reflect deeply before you reply!' What could I do when my heart cried pardon, when I held even in my hand the supplicating letter he had brought me from his father?— To grant it would be to resist my own self-love: to refuse it was repugnant to another love! A capitulation was necessary! — and a singular idea suddenly flashed ugon my mind. `Mr. Howard,' I said to Harry, `after what has occurred it is impossible for me to preserve the least relation with you. I have receieved an affront, and while it remains uneffaced —.' `My repentance—my excuses—' `It is not sufficient. You have outraged my feelings by indignantly responding `No,' before the clergymen and the witnesses present. I wish to stand in a precisely equal position. Consent to return with me to the church once more: there you shall respond `Yes,' and I publicly before the same minister and the same witnesses will return a round `No!' Then the affront will be reciprocal, the revenge equal to the injury, and, as you men say, honor will be satisfied! Afterwards we can, if you desire it, meet accordingly as our relatives may consent. And since, then, nothing requires we should be husband and wife, at least nothing shall impede our being good friends.' Now know, my dear Florence, that this proposition, although made in a serious tone of voice, was irresistably accompanied by a certain smiling air; my smile encouraged Harry, he accepted also smiling, and made the contract in the presence of my aunt. To-morrow morning this odd affair will be arranged, unless something intervenes now unforseen. I will astonish you, certainly; but I mean to carry out to the end my idea. Adieu, as ever, LOUISE. We give below the letter from Mr. Howard, of which Henry was the bearer Boston, Sept. 15, 184—, My dear daughter, Since yesterday I have been in bed with a fever. My malady proceeds from the heart! I can scarcely write you these few lines. The breaking off of the marriage upon which I had set my heart was too severe a blow for an old man, broken in health like me. The hope of seeing the union take place would have sustained me, and my health would have been better for it; but now I feel only quiet and repose can restore me. Take compassion on me, and be pitiful to my poor boy; for in being merciful to him, you are blessing me. Adieu. E. HOWARD. [A letter from Henry Howard, to Charles Lester.] Portland, Sept. 18th, 184-. Dear Charles, I know not whether I am sleeping or waking; but it appears to me that I dream! I told you in my last of the singular compact I had made with Louise. Yesterday was the day fixed; and I went to her house, resolved to perform my part, if she still was in earnest, as I thought she proposed it but in jest. The creature was serious! She was dressed in the same white robes, and her virgin veil was disposed so bewitchingly, yet modestly. — Heavens! how beautiful she was, my friend; a thousand times more lovely than on the first day! We entered the carriage and reached the church. The clergyman began to read the service, and when he put to me the question he had put on the former occasion I answered `Yes' with a smile upon my lips. When he put the same question to Louise my heart throbed with violence.... I glanced with enamoured eyes upon my beautiful companion, and the `no' we had prepared beforehand all at once appeared to me to be a species of blasphemy and culpable sacriledge!— But I had no time to reflect. Louise appeared deeply moved, and the clergyman had to repeat the interrogation. Louise raised her head, looked him full in the face and responded in a firm voice: `Yes.' We were married? To tell you what my sensations were at that moment is superior to my powers. A movement of Louise to hand me a paper caused me to return to myself. It was a lerter from my father she had just a few minutes before the hour received, and which decided her to change one article of our programme in order to save the infirm old gentleman's life—as she averred! Uneasy, Louise watched the expression of my face as I finished reading the letter.... I let drop a tear upon the paper, caught her hand and pressed it to my lips!..... My wife is divine! Within a quarter of an hour we were on on our way to the house of her aunt, and in an hour we started in the cars for Boston to my father! As soon as he embraces us in his arms he will be cured. With regard to you, my friends anti-conjugal, you cannot complain of me; because, if I am married, it has not been my fault. I have been made a husband by surprise, and in the only thing wherein I fail in my compact with you is in being very contented with my lot. I have not been false to celibacy; it is matrimony that has played me a trick! I am then married!!! You may pity me, my friend, pity me all of you.... I am the most fortunate of men. Your Benedictine, HARRY HOWARD. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TROUT-FISHING: OR, WHO IS THE CAPTAIN. BY J. H. INGRAHAM, ESQ. Author of `Captain Kydd,' `The Quadroone,' `The Beautiful Cigar Vender, `Frank Rivers,' `Forrestal,' `The Clipper-Yacht,' &amp;c. PART I. Having learned from my friend Larry McNeal, Esq., whom I knew to be an amateur in lake and brook fishing, that there was, certainly, trout to be had in a beautiful pond about sixteen miles from town, I equipped myself with a pliant jointed rod, strong silken lines, square hooks and covered basket, &amp;c., and took the cross-road stage for the place the very next morning. Larry saw me into the coach, but was to his great affliction unable to accompany me, as his lady a few days before presented him with a `little Larry,' and would by no means consent he should leave her to undertake such a perilous excursion, especially as no body but he could keep the baby quiet. `Good morning, my dear boy,' said Larry, with a long face, shaking me heartily by the hand; enviable fellow, to be able to go where you choose without leave! Heigho!' he sighed, looking comically serious; `I fear my fishing and liberty days are over! Han't been a fishing but once since I was married—a whole year—and then my anxious wife hired two men and a boy to follow me and stand on the bank of the stream to watch me lest I should get drowned! It's all up with me! I mean to make a will and dispose of my fishing tackle among my friends. Once in a while they may remember me and send me a seven pound avoirdupois `speckler' for my dinner!—Good bye, dear boy, and take warning from the fate and folly of the trouts themselves as they take your hook, and as you fish, moralize deeply on the dangers of hook baited with a woman's bright eyes! I was caught that way and now I am strung by the gills on the string that has for ages received all that suffer themselves to be thus caught! Good bye! There comes Dick, the boy, to tell me the baby is crying!' Here Larry gave me another shake of the hand, and with a look of ludicrous resignation turned away, to hurry homeward, and the coach drove on. The ride was beautiful and invigorating. The month was October, and the woodlands were gorgeous in their autumn silks and ribbons, and a smiling sky and a warm hazy atmosphere gave to all the scenes around the charms of an Italian painting. The road at its last part wound around the borders of a wide brook, or what Isaac Walton would have termed a `river.' It went brawling over stones as if scolding them for being in the way; and then again flowed smoothly beneath trees gay in orange and crimson foliage, smilingly reflecting their brilliant dyes upon its mirror in return for adorning its banks. As we rode on it would sometimes be enclosed by steep precipices jagged and dark with pines that frowned down upon the gay garniture of the maples and elms below like stern visaged deacons in the gallery looking down upon the scarlet trimmed bonnets and yellow scarfs the village maidens come to church in the fall, as if they would rival the hues of the field and woods. After emerging from a dark gorge where there was but just space sufficient for the narrow road and the torrent, we came into a pleasant vale with farms on either hand, and the spire of a village church in the distance. Gently hillsides arose on either hand finely cultivated, each farmer leaving a piece of woodland on his place, the effect of which, spreading over the landscape with pleasant hay fields and pastures between, was strikingly agreeable. As we left the gorge we parted from the stream which turned to the left. Being well assurred that it must come from the pond Larry had sent me too, I was prepared to see on rising to a small eminence over which the road wound, an extensive sheet of water, like a lake, stretching away to the west for half a league, on one side well wooded hills as glorious in their autumnal dyes as if a sunset closed, all gold and purple, rested upon them, the bright water, which not a zephyr stirred, reflecting them in the softest beauty. There were headlands jutting into the lake, and green islands and single rocks just where Codman's* pencil would have placed them, and just the height for the size of the water and the surrounding scenery. Away to the left it narrows to a dark recess overhung by rocks; and I know from the direction in which it was that there was the outlet of the stream which we had been following for the last half hour, and which turned away from us a mile back. On the east side of the beautiful sheet of water stood the village we were approaching, surrounded by green meadows and groups of trees. There were three or four pleasant and tasteful villas on the borders of the little lake with gardens reaching to the water. But one spot particularly attracted my attention. It was a small island near the shore on which stood a white cottage surrounded by a verandah and placed in the midst of a lewn, dotted with trees. It was a perfect paradise. From the stage window I could see two deer grazing on the lawn, and a large dog drawing a carriage along a gravel walk, in which was a child driving him. As we approached, the head of the island opened, and to my surprise, and which was only wanting to complete the picture, I discovered a fairy schooner of about twelve tons riding at her anchor under a rock. `Whose beautiful residence is that?' I enquired of the driver. `It belongs to the Cap'n!' he answered, precisely in a way as if there had been but one individual in the world who appropriated to himself this very rare title. He then whipped up his horses as if perfecily satisfied that my curiosity had been perfectly satisfied. `But what Captain?' I persevered in asking. `Don't you know the Cap'n!' he retorted with a nasal twang to the word. He then braced himself upon his box, and drawing his lash through his fingers, as a doctor feels his lancet before phlebotomizing his patient, he made the air resound with a crack of the whip like the report of a pistol. Off flew the horses, crack, crack, rung the whip about the heads of the leaders, and the next three minutes we were whirling through the village street at the rate of ten miles an hour, doubtless to give the good folks the idea that such was the speed with which he had come the sixteen miles. I cannot vouch that any of the good people were ever deceived by this ruse; if they were, the delusion would have been removed from their minds on the very first occasion their pursuits should call upon them to make the journey. I alighted before the inn door, and just as I was receiving from the driver's hands my covered basket and fishing rod, I heard the landlord say with admiration, `There goes the Captin's new turn-out! Ain't it a beauty, sir?' This last expression was addressed to me. I however did not reply instantly, for my attention was attracted by a very elegant phaeton to which a pair of spirited white horses were harnessed, rolling with delightful ease and celerity through the village, past the tavern, its wheels flashing in the sun; and the sunshine of a very beautiful woman's face in it bewildering my gaze. `Yes, sir, it is a tasteful equipage!' I now replied, it having disappeared. `But to whom does it belong, and who is the charming woman in it?' `It is the Capting's carriage, and that was the Capting's lady!' answered mine host. `Shall I take your basket, sir, and rod?' `Captain who?' `Why I thought every body know'd who the Capting was,' he answered, precisely in the way the driver had done before; and fairly ashamed of my ignorance I followed him into the bar room. From the window I had a fine view of the lake, with its painted shores, its beauteous isles, and, above all, of the island on which stood the `Cap'n's' or `Capting's' charming abode. It was now quite near me, and I saw that the distance from which I had before viewed it had not lent an enchantment to the view it did not merit on closer inspection. The house was a spacious verandah-cottage, built partly in the Chinese style, partly in the Turkish, with a green latticed colonnade, at one end, and a trellised conservatory on the other, giving the whole exterior a singular lightness and grace. A light bridge of a single arch connected the island with the main. `Will you have a room, sir?' asked Boniface. `I see you have come for trout in our lake, and will want to stop a few days of course! Nice salmon trout here, sir! The Capting caught one last Friday that weighed nine pounds!' `Pray who is this Captain, landlord?' `He lives over on the island, opposite, sir!' `And whose villa is that?' I asked, hoping to get an answer. `The Capting's, sir!' `And who the d—l is the Capting?' I demanded with some asperity. But the landlord had been addressed by a person who came in and left me to speak with him. `Well, I will let the `Capting' go for the present; I shall no doubt find out by some accident who he is, before I have been here two days. I won't ask again!' I now made preparations for trouting, and engaged as my guide to the lake a black man who owned a boat, and had come into the tavern to offer me his services, on hearing `a gemman,' as he said to me afterwards, had arrived with fishing tackle; for it was Banjo's profession to wait on the amateurs that from time to time visited the lake. As Larry had told me particularly to commit myself to Banjo, I did not hesitate to give the old negro my full confidence at once. `Do the trout bite freely, Banjo?' I asked, as we walked down a green lane towards the lake shore, which was but a quarter of a mile from the inn. I walked on before carrying my rod and two bundles wrapped up in brown paper, and the black trudging behind with the basket and two bottles of `Root Beer.' `Bite?' repeated Banjo, taking a longstride that brought him nearly abreast of me, and rolling round his eyes in as much surprise as if I had asked him who the Captain was; `guess 'em does bite. Trouf's am de hungridest fishes as ever wos seed. Dey snap at de sinker wid no hook on. Yah! yah! I cotch one so, onct, massa? the sinker get stuck in he frost and I haul him out! You see dat island ober dar!' `Yes, Banjo.' `Well, dat am whar we fish dis time ob day. By an' by when the sun come roun' dat way we pull ober under dat hill side whar you see dat blood red maple tree.' `You change your ground on account ofkeeping in shadowy water, hey, Banjo?' `Gi! I sees, Massa, you is perfectly on'stand trout fishin'! Now I ken al'ays tell by the little questions geemmen axes me if dey know any ting ob de sciense ob trouf-fishin'. I sees you knows.' `Thank you, Banjo. I feel flattered by your penetration.' `Dat am a genteel sentens, massa,' said Banjo, scratching his head, `but I don't thinks I'se precisely onstan' ebery word in him. Truf is, my eddikation wos omitted in my yout and I only picks up wot I knows from hearin' gemman talk. Sometimes, yah, yah, yah; and Banjo laughed till his sides shook, `sometimes, massa, get mitey puzzled!— De worst perplexer ob words I ever seed wos massa Larry McNeal! ki! He al'aye puzzle dis nigger. He know'd I'se al'ays a larnin' and savin' up de great words ob de gemmen, and so he wos mitey pertiklar and kind to talk in de most tickler perlite style afore me. I listens and listens, but debble ting I onderstand. Massa Larry's language al'ays stump dis sinner. Did massa, eber happen to know massa Larry?' `Oh, he's my particular friend, Banjo. He particularly recommend-you to me as a companion and guide on the lake,' I replied, smiling, but not wondering at Banjo's perplexity to understand the fabricated words of the ever quizzing McNeil. `Den I takes you under my 'ticklar charge, masssa,' said Banjo,' taking down two bars to let me pass from the lane to the beach; and looking quite delighted at the discovery he had made. Am massa Larry well?' `Quite so, Banjo. I suppose you heard he had a fine son. Banjo slowly shook his wooly head with a look of great wisdom while he said in a tone of amusing commiseration, `Sins massa Larry got hisself married, he am not de same man. He used be here twelve times in de year; but he jist come down onct arter he got a wife, and never cotch not one trouf, nothing but quohogs an yallar perch. He stay two hour and go home agen. I seed then somting was ail him. He neber cotch quohog afore. 'Sides dere wos no more ob his high word conversation. Ebbery ting he say I onderstan' perfectly. De fac wos he wos all broke up for fishin'. I'se nebber seed it turn out contrary, and I'se lived man and boy sixty-one year on dis pond, and I nebber know'd a good sportsman get married dat it did'nt spile his luck fishin'. I hope you aint married, master.' `No, Banjo.' `Dat am 'greeable 'telligence,' said Banjo, with great emphasis and satisfaction. `Dare nebber was such a lucky man as massa Larry, he sighed; `de werry troufs know'd when he wos on the lake, and dey'd al'ays come in scools round has line jist as if dey tuck it an honor to be cotch by him. Gorra! if I don't b'lieve dey used to fight to get furst at de hook.' We were now in a beautiful water-side path along the curving shore, with trees overshadowing it, and white sparkling sand at our feet.— After winding along the lovely shores we turned round a projecting rock and came upon a sheltered, romantic nook, in which was a little boat with two oars and a sail lying across the thwarts. It was a neat skiff painted green, and with the stern seats cushioned. `I hab to keep my boat keeley'd off on account ob de boys,' seeing I was trying to discover how we should get into it, as it was anchored full two rods from the rocks; `but Dick 'll be here in a minnit. Dar de young nigger goes now,' he cried, as a little darkey ten years old came scrambling down the precipitous bank. Before I asked how Dick could help the matter, the young black-ball had slipped off his shirt and trowsers, the only two garments that encumbered his limbs, and took to the water like a frog. He rose to the surface a rod from the shore, and shaking his wooly locks swam to the boat and scrabbled up to the side of it. `Shuck yourself, nigger, afore you gets in dar,' cried Banjo, authoratively, as the shining urchin was getting over the gunwale. Dick `shuck' first his head and then swinging his heels into the air shook the water out of them, and making a summerset landed upon his feet in the bows. He soon had the keeley up, and with an oar sent the boat towards us. We got on board, and Banjo taking an oar, and Dick, who had resumed his shirt and trowsers, another, we pulled out of the inlet into the lake. The hour was delightful for the excursion. It was late in the fore-noon of an October day, and the air was as soft and mellow as the sun-set hour in one of Murillo's Spanish `evenings.' The surface of the water was like plate-glass. The golden hill sides, the orange and green mantled islands, the black rocks, and even the slender spire of the village church were all reflected upon it with the similitude of an inverted painting. By turning my head and eyes downward I could see beneath the water a perfect counterpart of the scene above, only, if possible, softer and more lovely. As we got farther from the inlet, out of which we had emerged, the island with the verandah cottage opened before us, having been at first hidden by a low promontory of pines and oaks. For some moments I sat with my cheek resting in my hand admiring the beauty of the fairy scene it presented to my eye, with an irresistible curiosity to know who could be the person so well known to everybody but myself, and so much respected, whose taste and wealth had created that charming spot. I finally resolved to put the question to Banjo. `Beautiful situation on the island there, Banjo,' I said, carelessly. Banjo stopped pulling his oar and gazed in the direction of the spot. But Dick, who kept on rowing, began to send the boat round in a circle; at which Banjo knocked him on the head with a pin: `Stop dat oar, nigga! Wha' you keep rowin in dat debble fashun? Yes, massa, dat am beau'ful place, dat ob de Cappem!' `Banjo!' `Massa!' replied the black, looking me full in the face with surprise at my impressive manner. `Who is the Captain?' Banjo opened his eyes till the whites looked like two new-laid eggs with a shining black wafer stuck upon each. It was a look of pure astonishment mingled slightly with contempt. `Ki! am possiblum massa don' know whoo de Cappum am.' The nigger Dick also, the villain, turned round his ebony countenance, and thrusting his tongue into his cheek, looked at me steadily half a minute and then emitted a shrill `whew!' I felt like taking the boat's tiller and knocking the rascal overboard. `What is the Captain's name, Banjo?' I demanded with considerable irritation yet hardly keeping from laughing outright. `Massa Cappem!' answered Banjo emphatically. `His wife's then?' I said exultingly, thinking I should get it now, without fail. `She am de Cappen's lady!' `But has she no name—is she Mrs Nobody?' `I'se nebber hear noting ob one, 'cept dey calls her Cap'ns lady.' I internally vowed that I would not rest till my curiosity was satisfied in this matter which seemed oddly enough to be involved to me in such mystification. `Does the Castain now fish for trout?' I enquired of Banjo, who was once more pulling his oar. `He had de torches out ob nights and spears 'em! He likes dat sport! He nebber miss one!' `I should like to join in such sport.' I said with animation, having heard of the intense excitement of trout-spearing by torch-light, but never having yet participated in it. `Massa Cappem 'll hab his boats out first night de moon go away,' answered Banjo. `It will be three or four nights hence, before the moon will be gone. I shall then have a chance to witness the sport at least. There is a boat putting out from the island!' I said eagerly as I discovered a skiff emerging from the dark shadow of a group of water oaks. `Dat am de Cappem, I knows him by his flappin' hat!' said Banjo, looking an nstant in the direction of the island Paradise, which was about a third of a mile north of us. Our boat was just entering the shadow of a large black rock or wall, with a crevice ten yards wide through which the water rushed with a swift current, as the inclination of the plane of water towards the outlet began at this place. Here Banjo had said our fishing ground was to be. After a few strokes of the oar the keeleg was dropped under the face of the rock, and I prepared my rod and tackle for the sport that a place so well chosen, promised. I still watched the boat that had put off into the lake, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing it advance in a direction towards our anchorage. `I shall soon know who the Captain is,' I said to myself with some exultation, as I took from my pocket and placed to my eye a small telescope I always carried. This instrument brought him in close proximity to my vision; and I could see an elegant, fanciful boat, painted green, with a gilded head, and light as a shell, containing a single person in a sort of grey pea-jacket or blouse, fashionably cut, and a West Indian grass hat with the brim a foot wide. His back was towards me, for he was pulling; but I saw that he was a well-made, athletic man, with black whiskers. `The Captain is a seaman,' said I mentally; and after taking a steadier look at his mode of pulling his oars I was satisfied of the fact. His boat skimmed the transparent surface of the lake with the grace of a swallow on the wing; and he soon came so near that I closed my spy-glass, and casting my line into the black water, occupied myself with it while he approached; for he pulled directly to our nook under the shadow of the rocks. I had hardly cast my line ere the bob disappeared with a sharp dive from the surface, and my pliant rod curved like an arch while the end was drawn a foot beneath the water! I knew from the strain that I had hooked a trout of the heaviest size. I began to play him and having a reel to my line I let him run till he had unreeled a hundred, when I gave him this much to play with. It was a beautiful game? Banjo was in raptures, and only wished massa Larry was `dar!' After my captive had exhausted his mettle a little, I began gradually to reel him in till I had him within ten feet of the boat, when, with a skillful movement of the rod, which bent almost double under the weight of the fish, I transferred him from his element to the boat! It was a perfect salmon in size—the largest lake fish I had ever seen!' I had been so much occupied with playing and taming my prize, that I had paid no attention to the advancing boat. But a hearty, frank voice drew my attention in its direction, when I saw in it at rest, a talf, handsome, dark man, standing up in it looking towards us. He had evidently been watching the sport. `That is the finest trout ever taken out of this lake, sir, and you have played him beautifully!' he said. `He must weigh full eight pounds and a half. A perfect salmon!' `While he was speaking in this frank way, like an old acquaintance, I was occupied in endeavoring to recall his features, which were as familiar as my brother's, though time had dimmed their impression upon the memory. All at once I recognized him. I had discovered who `the Captain' was! But he too, had taken to surveying me! We both spoke in the same breath. `The devil!' he exclaimed, with a rich glow of generous pleasure, `is it possible that this can be you!' `And you, Captain! Can it be possible we meet again!' I cried with equal surprise and pleasure. He impelled his skiff towards our boat with a half dozen nervous strokes, and hands were clasped in a warm grasp that six years before, far beyond the seas, had parted under circumstances of the most interesting nature. But we defer them to the next chapter. PART II. The Captain insisted that I should exchance Banjo's canoe for his elegant, light boat, an invitation which I at once accepted, greatly to the chagrin of Banjo, who saw that his sport was up for that day. `Ah, master, de trout 'll kno' you jiss as well as they did master Larry, you ony fish two, tree hour more.' `I'll be out again on the lake to-morrow, Banjo, and engage you to meet me here, for I dare say my friend, the Captain, will come out with me here.' `Yes, with great pleasure,' said he. I saw by Banjo's eye that he was desirous of speaking to me out of hearing of the Captain, so I stepped towards the end of the boat to give him an opportunity. `Master,' says he, touching his hat and looking over his shoulder at my friend, `I'll forgib you dis time if you tell who am de Capting! You kno'. But debble any oder soul kno' in all de place.' `It's a secret,' says I looking very mysterious. `Yes, sar, I 'speck it am,' answered Banjo, gravely. `Can you keep a secret, Banjo.' `Sart'n, master,' he replied, rolling his large round eyes, and anxiously waiting for the announcement. `Won't you mention it, Banjo?' `Sart'n nebber to say a word, master, true as De Book!' `It would injure him you know, Banjo?' `Would it tho'?' he asked with a look of surprise and disquiet as he glanced at the `Capting,' who was engaged looking at a contest between a hawk and king-bird in the air over his head. `Most certainly,' I rejoined. `You can trust dis nigger, master.' `Well, did you never hear of Lafitte—Captain Lafitte?' said I. `The bloody pirate, master?' he cried, turning blue, which was his nearest approach to pale. I smiled, but made no reply, and the next moment the Captain by a stroke of his oar had sent his boat far away from that of the negro, whom I saw standing till we were out of sight looking after us, in the very attitude in which I had left him—an attitude of mingled astonishment, fear and horror. Little was I aware what my quizzing of poor Banjo, touching the Captain's name, was about to bring upon my friend. We rowed out into the lake and rested on our oars. We then lighted a Regalia each. He was disposed to converse and I to listen; and he thus related to me his adventures since we had last met, after satisfying himself that his regalia promised to draw well: `You will remember the day you left Monte Video to go to Colonia by land, under the escort of the Banda Oriental Cavalry Llavalleja politely offered you and your party, I took leave of you under the gate of the Calle del Rey. Well I returned slowly back towards the posada, after having seen your Cavalcade go out of sight, under full speed into the defile just beyound the gates. Well it was a fortunate departure for you, though I heard you had a severe time of it and more than one pretty fight with the Guachos horse-men. The very next day old Admiral Lobo enforced an embargo. There I was with my fine ship, locked up as safe as you could wish. I had a very valuable cargo selected expressly for the Buenos Ayrean market, where you know I was to proceed with the vessel after getting through with my sales in Monte Video. Well I won't talk of this till I speak of Dona Francesa Garcia. You remember her,' said the Captain smiling and looking mysterious, `the beautiful Spanish girl who was visting at Don Juan's opposite our Posada.' `I shall never forget her,' I answered. `She was exceedingly beautiful. She was a Buenos Ayrean and on a visit to the Portuguese family of Don Pedro with whom she was related. I believe her father had been President of the Banda Oriental country, a man of great wealth and influence!' `Yes. Well as I was returning from seeing you depart I was about to enter the posado when I saw Dona Francesa appear on her balcony and look towards me most entreatingly. She did not speak, but waved her hand. I would have replied by throwing her a kiss in return but I saw her face expressed alarm and grief. I immediately crossed over and passing under the heavy arched passage leading into the patio, I ascended the steps to the inner corridor. She met me at the head with her finger on her lip and an air of painful anxiety and distress pervading her whole manner. I became deeply interested. You know I had had so much dealings with Don Pedro that I visited them very freely and had seen much of her.' `I remember,' said I, laughing, `that you were over head and ears in love with the beautiful Banda Oriental. The Captain looked significant and smiled in the same manner he had done before. `Well, she led me into the little room that opens upon the veranda— that room filled with flowers, where we used to eat fruit.' `I remember it—a beautiful and cool retreat.' `She closed the door! I was surprised! She then went to her escritoire and took from it a note and in her sweet, flute-like sounding Spanish, said to me while her hand as she gave it to me trembled. `Senor Captain, I know that you are a brave man—a generous friend! You are an American—a native of the land of freedom—of that liberty for which my own unhappy country is now struggling. I have, therefore, sent for you! I can confide in no one else. My father's couzin, Don Pedro, is a Brazilian and — but read Senor!' I opened it and read: `Dear Lady Francesa, This is hastily sent to you to warn you that I have received certain intelligence that there will be at sunrise to-morrow an embargo enforced upon the port and that the river will be occupied for the purpose of blockading Buenos Ayres. The Brazilian General — D— now in command here, whose overtures you have repeatedly rejected, I am assured from a certain source, will avail himself of this embargo to detain you in the city that he may, by having you in his power, compel you to accept his hand. You know his character and that no principle would deter him from his will. Your father being so high in position among the enemy will be an excuse for keeping you under close surveillance, under the pretence that you may correspond with him in the character of a spy. Therefore, fly! dearest Francesca! Ask not for a passport, for General D— will throw detentions in the way till the embargo is enforced, and then you are his prisoner!' Your friend, MARIA. `This is surprising,' said I; but I thought less of my ship and cargo at that moment than of the peril and distress of the lovely Buenos Ayrean. `This kind note then is written by the Governor General's niece?' `Yes—we are friends! She had risked her own personal liberty to aid me.' `And I,' I responded warmly, `will sink my life to serve you further.' I thought she would have cast herself at my feet when I said this. `Oh Senor, God bless you! Save me from a fate to me worse than death. To be a prisoner—nay to be bound in chains would not make me fear! but I can never be in the power of the hateful General D—. I can now see why he had thrown obstacles in the way of my return to Buenos Ayres, for the last six weeks.' I reflected a moment. All my chivalry was awakened and all my heart was enlisted in her cause. My position was this: In the port lay my vessel with only about two thirds of her freight for Monte Video discharged, and about sixty thousand dollars of freight destined for the Buenos Ayreau Market. There was no time to discharge the freight that belonged there, and I did not like to weigh anchor and carry it away! for I had instantly resolved to start that night in advance of the embargo—and to take with me the lovely Spanish maiden. My plan was soon formed. I noticed that my silence and thoughtfulness was watched by her with intense anxiety. `I have a plan to rescue you, Senorita Francesa,' said I, `from the fate which alarms you. Will you trust yourself confidingly to me?' `I have no one else! I dare not trust Don Pedro! Yes, oh yes!' she said with a sincerity and fervor that made me feel very happy about the heart, and more than ever confirmed me in my purpose to devote myself unreserved, and at whatever sacrifice, to her safety. You smile.' `Go on, my dear Captain, I was only wondering if you had ever told this animated story to your wife—for I understand you are married!' `Ask her, when we get home,' he said quietly. He then resumed. `I said, Dona Francisca, `My ship is in port, but not ready for sea! But I shall get under weight to-night. I shall at once proceed to make arrangements privately for departing. In the meanwhile you do the same. But you will need a disguise. General D— will possibly have an eye on you, and it would be impossible to get you on board in the attire of a female without suspicion!' She colored—looked embarrassed and then said, `I will be guided by you Senor.' `Then I will send you, nay,' I said, fearing to trust any one, `I will bring you a suit of seamen's clothes. I have a lad on board who has a suit he has never worn that will fit you. Your hair, if possible, should be gathered up under the hat! `I will cut it off, she said. `Not for the world,' I cried. `You remember, what beautiful hair she had, half the length of a ship's holiday pennon! She promised to put on the clothes and conceal her rich cloud of hair, and I told her I would be ready for her at eight o'clock when it was dark. I was to call for her and she was to meet me in the patio with a bundle, and follow me as one of my own men to the quay. `This was a rare plan, if there had not been so many of these guard houses to pass, at every one of which we were challenged. `Quien va la?' must have met you at every corner!' `I had got everything arranged, but did not tell any one of my intended departure but our Consul, who said he would acquit me to the owners; for he supposed I had only one project in view that of saving my vessel. I did not make him a confidant touching the new hand I was to ship. Well, at eight o'clock precisely I made my appearance at porte cochere of Don Pedro's house. It was lighted only by the faint glimmer of a lamp hung over the inner arch. The sound of the falling waters of the fountain in the pateo covered my footsteps as I walked carefully in. I glanced up at the corridor and saw a figure moving in the shadow of the gorgeous tropical plants that adorned it The next moment the fluttering hand of the charming Banda Orientalist was in mine! The family of Don Pedro consisted only of himself, who was all the time in his counting room at one corner of his casa, his wife and two daughters of eighteen and twenty. Neither of them had she made her confidant, because the eldest had lately become her rival touching General D— which the latter was too volatile, and would, doubtless, have insisied on running away too!' `But how did you converse the first time so long with Dona Francisca undiscovered?' `The young ladies were walking on the alameda with some young Brazilian officers, and Don Pedro was casting accounts as usual in his casa de comercio.' `As we passed beneath the light of the lamp I was surprised as well as pleased and greatly relieved to see how like a young sailor she looked. She had suffered one or two short ringlets to fall on each cheek, and the suit fitted her as if it had been made for her. I saw she blushed deeply as she caught my eye and strove to conceal her face by dropping her countenance towards the ground. Well, she followed me, after I had encouraged her confidence in herself, and I answered all the challenges with the usual `Camarada,' but was not stopped. I reached the quay and got into my boat. To avoid suspicion, for the guard had lights looking at us pull off, I gave Francisca the helm, as if she were my coxswain, and we then pulled for the ship. We got on board in safety, and I immediately escorted her to a state room which I had fitted up for her reception, whence soon afterwards she re-appeared in the cabin in her graceful Castillian costume. Her first act was to kneel and kiss my hand, which her tears of gratitude also bedewed. I assured her of my protection, while in my heart I felt I would give world's to be under hers! The two mates, fine fellows both as you remember, had got every thing ready. There was a light wind blowing right out of the harbor. You remember it was full of vessels. Above me lay at least forty merchantmen, to the captains of seven of which, all my acquaintances, I had communicated the information of the coming blockade. They were also doing their best quietly. Out side of me were anchored at least twenty vessels of war, besides the guard ship seventy four anchored in the mouth of the harbor and the two fort s!' `I remember them all! What a risk to run!' `At eleven o'clock the tide set out. Every man went about our decks in bare feet noiseless as kittens. It was a cloudy star light night, with the wind blowing about five knots from the North. At a few minutes after eleven our topsails and top gallant sails were loosed. Every block that creeked was greased. The sheets were hauled home without noise, and the jib and spanker set. This precaution was necessary, as on our starboard quarter not two cables length lay a Brazillian corvette, and on the other beam a sloop of war was anchored. We held on to our ancher until the wind began to help us and then we slipped cable and let her fall off. I had marked my course out by day light and now took the helm myself. Donna Francisca I had prevailed upon to retire, assuring her of her safety now that she was on board. It was a pretty ticklish affair steering in a dark night through a dense armed fleet. But it was to their being so thick that we owned our escape. We passed the corvette and then a brig of war, hailed first by one and then by the other. I gave in reply the name of the Brazillian corvette, `Alceste,' which you remember was anchored far up the harbor. So I passed on, followed as I saw by two or three of the merchantmen. As it so happened they gave suspicious answers, one of them actually giving `The Alceste.' Instantly an alarm gun was fired. It was answered from the guard ship, for which I was very much obliged to them, as but for its flash I should have steered right into a Portugese frigate. It also showed me the true position of the guard ship. The frigate taking the alarm hailed me, and I replied as before answering back in Portugese that I was in pursuit of a vessel running out. My ship you know was of large size with painted ports and black sides, and altogether having a very warlike look. If they suspected me they feared to fire, for many vessels and the town lay in range. I soon saw them signalizing with colored lights from the sloop of war I had passed. Answering lights appeared in the guard ship, and I knew I should get it as I went by her without a ruse. Firing of musketry now began to take place astern and I saw that some of the merchantmen were getting it roughly. Making my men lie down, I kept on and when I came near I ranged up close under the stern of the guard ship, and with my trumpet first hailed her!' `A bold step!' `It proved a successful one! I denominated my vessel the `Alceste,' and said that I was in pursuit of a boat that had passed out of the harbor. I was suffered to pass on, when if they had burned a blue light they would see what I was at a glance. In ten minutes more I was beyond range of her guns and stretching away under all sail I could carry for Buenos Ayres. PART III. THE CONCLUSION OE THE CAPTAIN'S STORY.. `After we had cleared the guard-ship which a few moments afterwards opened her fire upon a Portuguese brigantine on our quarter instead of upon us, the fort on the point began to blaze away, but not knowing exactly what to fire at, her shot did more mischief than it did our vessel.' `I am surprised,' I remarked, on hearing his extraordinary account, `at your remarkable escape. I remember how well guarded the harbor was; that it was crowded with vessels of the enemy; that the entrance was not a quarter of a mile across, a third of which was taken up by the huge hulk of the guard-ship, with a fort on either shore. It was a great risk.' `Not greater than remaining behind. Besides you must not forget the beautiful Buenos Ayrean and the perils from which I rescued her, as well as my ship and cargo. One will do a great deal where a lovely woman is interested,' added the Captain with a mixture of sentiment and courage.' `And for one so eminently beautiful as Senorita Garcia.' `Yes. Well, we got but one shot from the guard ship which passed through the fore topsail, and two shots from the fort, one of which knocked our starboard cat-head overboard and the other glanced along the main yard, splintering a place six feet long and parting the earing. The wind now blew stronger as we cleared the land, and the ship went bowling along with every thing drawing at the rate of seven knots.— We rapidly left the harbor and its lights far behind us, for they kept up an irregular hammering away from the fort for half an hour after we were safely beyond gun shot, probably at the other vessels coming out —two of which only escaped. You remember the British frigate `Dorris.' `Commanded by Sir John Sinclair? She lay at anchor in the outer roads, six miles from town.' `Yes. Well I soon came up with her, and on account of the shoal water had to run pretty close to her. I was hailed and gave my ship's name and rounded to under her stern, and went on board. Sir John whom I knew was in his birth but was called and after expressing his surprise at seeing me at that time, invited me into his state room, where I communicated to him what I had learned in relation to the blockade. He was very indignant and swore if a single British merchant-man was detained he would lay his frigate before the town and cannonade it.— I advised him, as there was yet four hours to daylight, to send in to the Captain's of the merchant-men and give them orders to get out the best way they could. I understood afterwards that he went directly on shore—waited on General D— before he was up, and demanded and obtained permits for the vessels to depart before the blockade should be enforced. After taking a glass of wine with Sir John and his `First,' I returned on board my ship. I found Senorita Garcia awaiting me on the deck, very much alarmed at my delay, and fearful of our being pursued. Her fears were not without foundation as I very soon discovered. I had hardly filled away when my mate asked me to look astern in the direction of the port. I took my glass and saw plainly a large ship standing out and stretching after us. I could not tell whether she was a large sized merchant-man or a ship of war. I resolved, however, to act on the safest side, and gave orders to have every thing set that would hold wind. I had not been running in this way more than twenty minutes and was not more than two leagues from the frigate Dorris, when the look out in the bows called out suddenly, `sail ho.' `Where away?' I asked. `Dead ahead. There's two sir. The other a point off the lee bow.' `I sprang forward, and standing on the heel of the bowsprit, saw not a mile distant two vessels directly ahead. I well knew the river was full of cruizers, and it was the part of discretion for me to believe these to be such and act accordingly. I stood on for a few minutes, till I was able to make them out to be two large ships, laying to within a half a mile of each other, but whether vessels of war or not I could not tell. But taking it for granted that merchant vessels would be likely to be in a hurry in such dangerous waters and could have no business laying to in a seven knot breeze, I made up my mind that they were a part of old Admiral Lobo's fleet, which was in the river, though I supposed lower down. So I took the bearing of both with the compass, and giving my mate the helm I took my station on the heel of the bowsprit and directed him how to steer so as to give the suspicious fellows an equal birth on either side of my ship. `We were now within half a mile of them. The firing in the direction of the town had ceased, and the ship which had followed us out was scarcely visible astern. I had, therdfore, nothing to fear save from these two bull-dogs that lay in my path. Confident that they had no more knowledge of my character than I of their's, I kept boldly on, keeping a hair-line between them. `Steady,' said I to the mate. `Steady it is!' `Port a little!' `Port a little!' answered Brown in his deep voice. `As you are!' `As we are.' `Starboard!' `Starboard, 'tis!' I now made them out to be both ships of war.— One of them was a large frigate and the other a corvette. Both of them were under their three topsails with the main laid to the mast, and with jibs and spankers set. I now went aft and sent Senorita Garcia to her state room, who left the deck with reluctance, wishing with noble generosity to share the danger, `that,' as she said, `menaced her deliverers!' `Brown, you might as well sit down on the deck and steer,' said I, `we are likely to have a shot if we don't heave to, which I have no intention of doing. I wouldn't like to have you made a head shorter.'— `Hadn't I better go below and keep the lady company, Sir?' said the mate dryly. `I shall stand and steer, Sir!' `Well, then have your own way.' I then sent below every man I did not want on deck and took my place in the weather fore-rigging.— The ships were now nearly abeain, looking dark and sullen, and showing no signs of motion. Each was a quarter of a mile from me on either bow. I had every thing set, to royals and lower and top mast studdensails, and looked as if I was making the best of my legs.— They doubtless thought so too; for all at once the frigate was illumined with a flash like lightning, and then came a report that told me they had no intention of letting me go past without scraping an acquaintance with me. The gun was, I well knew for me to heave to. But I only replied by giving an order to Brown to keep her `steady.' In a moment afterwards came another gun with a sharp, hard report which told me that it was shotted. The missile went between my main and mizzen not ten feet from the deck, and the next instant I heard it distinctly plunge pung! into the ribs of the corvette opposite. The frigate evidently saw that her shot endangered her consort and waited until we had passed out of range and then she opened her bow guns smartly. The corvette followed her example and for a few minutes I was exposed to as heavy a fire as I should ever wish to be. I owed my escape from entire destruction, from being fairly blowed out of water partly to the darkness of the night, the constant onward motion of my vessel and the fact that they could at first only bring their bow guns to bear upon me. As it was I was hulled in half a dozen places; my main yard was shot out of the slings and came down upon the deck, the lee quarter boat was stove, and three of my men were wounded between decks, not one being hurt on deck except Brown whose right arm was severely bruised by a splinter; but he dryly said he could steer quite as well with his left and would not quit the wheel. Running as we were at full eight knots an hour I was soon beyond reach of their shot. The corvette now ceased firing, and filling away began to make sail. In a few minutes she was covered with clouds of canvass and came after us barking from her bow-guns as savage as a mastiff. The frigate, after firing a little longer and finding she did not disable us, imitated the example of the corvette and also made sail. By this time I was half a mile ahead, and had every way the advantage. Rapidly increasing the distance between us, in an hour I was two mile ahead of them and at daylight I had the pleasure of seeing them a league astern. I then set the American colors and fired one only eighteen pounder gun to windward, and bade them a good morning. `I afterwards understood that Admiral Lobo had placed his fleet in the river three days before with the intention of turning back all vessels even before the blockade should be enforced, and that there were two vessels of the squadron, which amounted to sixty sail, stretching from shore to shore where the river is about sixty-five miles wide, laying to or anchored a mile or so apart. So you see I have fairly run the guantlet of this illegal blockade.” `It was a bold act.' `What could I do! Well, all that day I kept on, the frigate and corvette giving up the chase; and about four in the afternoon I discovered a fleet of a dozen sail ahead. With my glass from the fore top I made out the Buenos Ayrean colors, and knew they were friends!' `It was admiral Browne with his squadron going down to attack Lobo, was it not?' `Yes. He had heard this morning as he lay below Ensanada, by a Baltimore schooner that had run through the fleet, that Lobo had brought his squadron up. Whereupon he resolved to drive him from his position. He had but a single sloop of war, that had once been a New York merchantman, four brigs, a half a dozen schooners and gun boats. But Browne never counted guns or numbers. He possessed that indomitable energy which conquers where it wills to. It was just sun-set as we met his fleet. I came to and waited for the flag ship to approach, when I was hailed by the admiral in person, told him what had transpired. He requested me to come on board. He met me at the gangway, and gave me a hearty shake of the hand and invited me into his cabin. I then gave him an account of my escape and where I had left the two Brazilians. He told me that he was on his way to break the blockade, and felt confident that he should do it. Browne is an Irishman and had once been an officer in the British navy. He is you know, for he is still in commann in the La Plata, bold and full of courage. He was then about fifty, and limped from a wound he had got in battle. After a little further conversation I left him and he made sail, and I did the same, standing up the river while he went down. You have probably heard the result of his expedition. Te found the two vessels that had cannonaded me at anchor, and laying his ship between them before they could weigh he let them have it right and left, dismasting the covette, and hulling the frigate so badly that she had to put into Monte Video, all the time kept afloat only by the pumps. His other vessels acted with equal gallantry. The blockading force was dispersed and several merchant vessels that were waiting below went up with their freights.' `I remember the account of the action. It was a brave affair. But now your own adventures! What has become of Dona Garcia?' `The next day I reached Ensanada, and put in there for safe harbor. From this port to Buenos Ayres is but thirty miles. This I pulled in my long boat, making a nice little apartment in the stern with awning and mattresses for the Senorita Francisca. On the afternoon of the third day after leaving Monte Video we came in sight of Buenos Ayres. It has eight or nine domes as large as that of the State House in Boston, crossing its cathedrals, and to every dome there is from three to four stately towers. The buildings have flat roofs and battlements and are ornamented with urns and turrets. Altogether it is one of the finest cities in South America. As we pulled along the green shores towards the city, Senorita Garcia grasped my hand and with tears of eloquent gratitude thanked me for her life and happiness. Shall I tell you,' said my friend slightly embarrassed and smiling, that I discovered in her eyes and in the tones of her voice a deeper and tenderer sentiment than mere gratitude!' `I should have anticipated this,' I said. `I felt myself a happy fellow, when I discovered it; for I was already in love with her as deeply as one could be with a pretty woman.' `Ah, I see you have never told this story to your wife, my dear Captain.' A significant, yet to me mysterious smile was his only reply; and he then continued, `We got opposite the town, but as the water was so shoal I was not able to get within a quarter of a mile of the shore with the boat, and run aground in two feet and a half of water. But there was no danger of not getting to the land; for we had hardly struck the bottom when a troop of the guacha “hackmen,” you so well know, mounted on their little wiry horses, gallopped into the water and came splashing towards us at full speed, their red pouchas flying in the wind, looking like a troop of grotesque savages. They came near, shouting like devils, and would have splashed the boat full of water if I had not presented a pistol to keep them off. I then called two of them, one of whom wanted to mount me behind himself, and the Senorita Garcia on the horse behind his companion. But I objected to this arrangement. I made him get behind his companion, and taking his horse mounted Francisca behind me, and in this style galloped ashore, followed by the whole troop. At the landing I found a volante, and getting into it, we drove to the dwelling of the happy girl. I will pass over the joyful meeting—the grateful expressions of joy with which I was overwhelmed. While I was in Buenos Ayres I became an inmate of General Garcia's family. In fine, never was a man better rewarded for an act of benevolence than I was. When at length I left Buenos Ayres, it was with the impression that the Senorita Francisca was the most charming creature on earth!' `And you the most insensible,' said I, `to leave behind one so every way worthy of you! I should like to see your wife, to know who could surpass Senorita Francisca in your estimation. Upon my word, I thought you were going to give me a regular love story with a marriage at the end.' The Captain smiled. The next moment we reached the cove near his villa and landed. His wife was seen approaching with a little girl of three. As she came nearer I uttered an exclamation of surprise and pleasure. It was Dona Garcia! This sketch now ends in a few words. The captain had come into possession of great wealth by his union with the beautiful Buenos Ayrean, and retired to his native village, where he had erected the handsome villa already described, and improved the ground, living in a state of perfect happiness. He kept on the lake a beautiful little brig of ten tons to remind him of his former pursuits, and for the purpose of making parties on the water. `And why are you known only as “the Captain?” I asked the next day as we were smoking in the verandah together. Before he could reply, a servant announced a visiter, and I obtained no answer, and to this moment I am in as much mystery as any of my readers. THE END.</field>
