      <field name="fulltext">TO THE PUBLIC. The history of the Buccaneers abounds with perilous enterprises and romantic adventures, which afford a field for the highest powers of the novelist; but hitherto American authors have avoided this fertile ground. In “Ringwood the Rover” the writer has sought to give a picture of the nobler class, as well as to describe some of the daring undertakings of these free rovers of the seas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RINGWOOD THE ROVER. CHAPTER I. The earliest dawning of a lovely summer day, in the year 1659, was pouring its sweet light, unclouded yet with that fierce heat which renders almost insupportable the noontide hours, over the forests which encircled, with a belt of ever-during verdure, the Spanish city of St. Augustine. It was already in those days a place of much importance, with nunneries, and steepled churches, and terraced dwellings, with white walls and jalousies peeping from out the foliage of dark orange groves, and all those beautiful peculiarities of semi-Moorish taste, which lend so much of poetry and of romance to the old towns of Spain. It had its flanking walls, its ditches, and its palisades, presenting their impregnable resistance to the fierce and wily Indian, whom the relentless cruelty of the white colonist, of whatsoever nation, had at length goaded into systematic and continual hostility; in seaward bastions, with water-gate and demilune, mounted with heavy cannon, and garrisoned by old Castilians, under an officer who bore the style of royal governor. Such was the aspect of the place at the conclusion of the first century which had elapsed since its foundation; nurtured into undue maturity by the stern bigotry and energetic enterprise of that land, which had filled the southern continent with giant-cities, over whose ramparts floated its proud motto of Plus Ultra, marking every spot whereon its sons had set a foot by massacre and blood-shed and drained from El Dorado—as they justly termed it—these vast but fatal treasures, which raised it for a little while above all nations of the earth, only to plunge it in the end into effeminacy and ruin and effete barbarism. The heavy dews, as they were exhaled by the rising day god, teemed with the incense of unnumbered perfumes wafted from the ten thousand vegetable wonders which had given name to that peninsula, wherein credulity, insatiate of all that nature had bestowed with profuse bounty, had placed the seat of all those monstrous fictions which alchymists had palmed upon their dupes, until they brought themselves to deem them real. The land-breeze swept far seaward the rich odors from the orange groves, and the vast forests whence gleamed frequently the snowy chalices of the superb magnolia, and the dense star-like blossoms of the flowering dogwood, and colored the azure waters of the Gulf into a thousand tiny wavelets, which sparkled with innumerable smiles to the bright heaven, while the thrilling and prolonged notes of the emulous mocking-birds—nightingales of the west, with scarce inferior song—made everything resound with their rich liquid melody. On earth—on ocean—and in the cloudless ether, all was calm, lovely, peaceful —but on the bastions of the town there was the din of arms, the dissonant harsh clang of mingling voices, the hurrying to and fro of soldiery, the long roll of the drum beating to arms in haste, blent with the piercing strain of trumpets, and the continuous peal of bells, rung backward, as it seemed, in token of dismay and danger. Beneath the yellow flag with its tri-castled blazonry, surrounded by a group of noble-looking men, clad for the most part in the half-armor of the day, with much of waving plumage, rich lace, and fair embroidery, stood the governor, Juan Melendez de Aviles, descendant of that Pedro, of the same noble name, who, by an exertion of both skill and valor, which, had they not been tarnished by the most fiendish cruelty, would have been deemed heroical, won for the second Philip the fair province from the French Huguenots of Coligny. The eyes of all that little group were intently fixed upon the sea, from which it would appear the apprehended danger—if apprehended danger it were, that gave rise to those tokens of surprise and preparation—was most to be expected, and in the visages of all, an evident expression of anxiety and doubt was marked, in its least doubtful character. But in the face of no one there, were there such signs of perturbation and dismay, as in that of the governor. He was a man of large and heavy build, a veteran of many a bloody war, with limbs which, although deprived somewhat of agility and lightness by the unsparing hand of time, were cast in a mould of iron; his features prominent, bold, and haughty, with a world of iron resolution in the firmly compressed mouth, and massive jaw, and a glance of intolerable fire in the dark eye; and his bearing, such as became a cavalier to whom the camp and court had been alike familiar from his first boyhood. But now his rich dress was in disarray; a leathern shoulder-belt with an immense two-handed sword attached to it, and a display of cumbersome and ill-wrought pistols thrust hastily into a broad buff-girdle, assorted ill with a fair garb of courtly fashion; his long hair, once as black as jet, but now discolored with full many a streak of wintry grey, hung in disordered masses over his broad brow, lank, and uncurled, and graceless—and on his brow the perspiration stood in drops, like bubbles on the bosom of some turbid stream—and the deep olive tints of his complexion wore an unnatural and ghastly hue—and, as he grasped a powerful perspective-glass with which he ever and anon swept the horizon, his fingers might be seen to work in quick convulsive twitches, as though they would have bedded themselves into the polished brass. “Nothing?” he said, after a long and wistful gaze, “I can see nothing seaward. Yet right sure am I, that those sounds were of far-distant ordnance. It is the twelfth too of the month, and long ere this, the caravel we were advised of should have been safe in harbor. Hark! hark! heard ye not then,” he cried, “heard ye not that dull roar to the eastward? Pedro, Gutierrez, hearken-what say ye, cavaliers, is 't not the voice of ordnance?” “Past doubt, it is,” replied the elder of the gentlemen he had addressed, “and heavy ordnance too.” “And lo! a sail!” exclaimed the other, who had directed his glass instantly towards the quarter whence the sounds proceeded, “I marvel how we saw her not before. Here! here, your Excellency! here! bring your palmetto in the range of the east angle of the demilune, and you will catch her! Now, by St. Jago, I can see her to the courses; three tiers of wide-spread canvas!” “I have her now,” replied Melendez, thoughtfully, “I have her now. 'Tis she; it is El Santo Espiritu, past doubt; but wherefore was she firing? Pray Heaven, these cursed English, these infernal rovers, be not upon her track!” “I fear me much it is so,” answered Gutierrez. “I fear me much it is so; for ever and anon, I fancy I catch glimpses, as they rise upon the waves, of smaller sails behind, and further yet to the eastward. Lo! now in range with you skiff upon the beach— there! it has sunk again—and now, again, I catch it!” “Ay! and again she fires! pray Heaven she have the heels of them; once under our guns, she were in safety from any armament which they can bring against her!” Meanwhile the vessel, which had been first seen hull-down in the far offing, was rising rapidly as she drew near, not having met as yet the counter-influence of the land-breeze—but scarce less rapidly rose, one by one, the smaller barks, which had at first escaped the notice of the eager and excited watchers; until five low and rakish craft might be distinctly seen in chase of the tall frigate. One somewhat larger than the rest, three-masted, but of the same sharp and picarooning build, was now so near astern, that she was able to keep up a constant firing from her bow-guns, which the caravel returned with her stern chasers; though it was evident by the rate at which she rode the waves, staggering along with every stitch of sail set that could draw, that she was most sincerely anxious to avoid close action with her diminutive antagonist. An hour had elapsed at most since she had been at first made out; and had there been anything of real doubt as to the nation of the frigate, or the character of her pursuers, that doubt was now entirely at an end; for at the distance of about five miles, by the aid of strong glasses, it was not difficult to note the castled bows and poop of the tall caravella, bristling with culverin and demi-cannon, or to distinguish the proud bearings of Castile upon the yellow colors which, in the hope perhaps of bringing help and succor from the friendly fort and city, she wore not only at her three mastheads, but at the bowsprit-end, and some six or seven other points conspicuous in her rigging. Meanwhile, the foremost of the chasing squadron had hoisted at her peak the snowy field of England, with the broad bright St. George's cross, while at each one of her masts' heads a bloody flag with the black skull and cross bones proclaimed her real character. And now the agony of Juan de Melendez had become fearfully, intensely visible; to and fro upon the narrow esplanade above the water-gate, with quick, uneven steps, and features haggard with excitement, did he stalk during that long hour; now pausing for an instant to note the progress of the chase, and now with a despairing gesture again resuming his distracted walk—his officers surveying him the while with looks denoting deep commiseration, but more of that surprise, which must have been felt by men ignorant of the cause of his strange gestures and bewildered mien. “She will escape them yet! Be of good cheer,” cried one, a young and noble-looking gallant, “be of good cheer, your Excellency; she brings the sea-breeze up with her right manfully!” “Aye doth she,” cried another, “for the nonce; but wait till she strike the counter-blast; lo! you may see it ruffling the surface now within a mile of her!” “And when she doth,” exclaimed the younger officer, “she can beat in, I trow; tack and tack, merrily; and they can but beat after her. Why in half an hour more she will be safe here, under our batteries!” “Not so! not so!” cried Juan de Melendez, mournfully, “she never will lie here at anchor any more, if she trust to her sails! Curse on the fool Davila, that turns not on that paltry picaroon, and crushes her at three broadsides before her consorts may come up! See you not, Pedro, and see you not, Diego, who art a mariner so skilful—see you not that the sea-breeze even now has failed them, and that the land-wind dies away momently? God! God of my fathers! that we must stand here helpless, and strike no blow in her behalf. Yet! yet! if he would tack, while he hath way upon her, he might engage the pirate yard-arm to yard-arm, and so quell him; but even now he loses; he hath lost it! His sails flap idly to the mast; it is dead calm! Fool! fool! accursed fool! and he hath anchored.” “But it is no less calm for them! picaroons though they be, and manned by devils, yet cannot they make sail, more than the caravella!” “Look!” was the sole reply of the wellnigh distracted governor—“Look!”—and it needed but a glance to show that the ill-fated frigate had now, indeed, no hope but in the vigor of her own defence—for low and light, and built no less for oars than sails, the wind had scarcely left them, a half league at the most astern of the Spaniard, ere they had furled their lateen sails, and getting out their sweeps, came up scarce slower than before, crowded with men whose weapons might be seen momentarily glancing to the broad sunshine. “My child—great God—my child!” cried Juan de Melendez, his pale features writhing with horrible intensity of anguish—“Would, would that thou wert dead, Teresa! And is all lost?—is all lost, gentlemen? Shake not your heads, look not so gloomily upon me; can ye devise no scheme, no hope, no possibility—and yet how should ye, when we have neither boat nor even store enough of pirogues in the bay, to bear them any succor? Oh! would, would Heaven, that I had died, I care not how disgracefully, so that I were but dead, ere I had been so fettered here, to look thus helpless on the murder of my comrades—the worse than murder of mine innocent and lovely child! and thou, Don Amadis, thou who hast dared to lift the eyes of love to her—canst thou stand statuelike and strike no blow for her? Canst thou endure almost to hear the shrieks, almost to look upon the form, of her thou wouldst have wedded, writhing in agony in the foul arms of the licentious buccaneer! A man! a gentleman! ha! ha! a soldier—ha! ha! ha! a man, a gentleman, a soldier, and an old Castilian look tamely on the violation of his bride, before the very eyes of her insulted father!” “Answer him not, Don Amadis”—the grey-haired veteran Pedro interposed—“answer him not, I pray; this is sheer madness—the pardonable madness of parental anguish!— And you, Sir Juan”—he continued, turning half-frantic to the governor—“think you not if we were to clear the long guns of the southern bastion, we might yet drive those picarooning scoundrels from their prey—methinks the caravella lies even now within their range?” “No! no! you but deceive yourselves— there is no hope! none! none! Nathless we may essay it—and see, Davila hath slipped even now his cables, hath got his boats out, and tows cheerily towards us. Away there, ye knave cannoniers, clear the long culverins, ourselves, we will go down and point them.” And with these words, followed by all his train, he hastily rushed down the narrow stairway of the rampart, passed through the sally-port, and in a moment was engaged among the guns, with an anxiety and zeal that for a moment quelled his mental agony. The caravella now was but a short mile from the seaward batteries, towed by the whole strength of her crew, rowing with that tremendous energy which the consciousness that all is centred in his own exertions, lends to the meanest and the feeblest man that draws the breath of life! One half mile more would have ensured her safety. It was a fearful chase! So close behind her was the best manned and largest of the picaroons, that now the fire, which had been for awhile suspended, again became hot, animated, and destructive. And now the mizen of the caravel came thundering, with all its hamper, over her groaning side, encumbering her fatally, and lessening her way through the calm waters; while at the sight a long, loud yell of savage exultation burst from the desperadoes who had wrought that ruin, and penetrated even to the ears of the appalled spectators. Hitherto no opportunity had been given to the Spaniards on the fortress for firing a gun in aid of their companions; since the three-masted galley, conscious of her advantage, kept herself by her sweeps and oars under the stern of the tall frigate, raking her fore and aft by a continual fire of her single gun, a culverin of the first class, avoiding thus alike the heavy ordnance of her broadside, and the yet heavier metal of the batteries which were deterred from firing lest they should injure their own friends! But now two other of the pirates, which, in the chase, had made each a long circuit on the starboad and larboard tacks, keeping as much as possible out of the frigate's range, having shot far ahead of her, changed suddenly their course, putting their bows each right towards the other, and pulling with great speed to cut her off from her desired haven. On these, at the same instant, opened the frigate's fire, gun after gun from both broadsides, a fierce incessant cannonade! and the tremendous salvo of the batteries. The whole shores seemed to rock with the concussion! the little air there had been heretofore, stilled by the fearful shock, sank utterly; and, ere ten minutes had elapsed, the surface of the water was covered by a dense mass of volumed smoke, so closely packed that not an eye of all who gazed so fearfully upon the scene, could note vessel, or boat, or any living being, though still from out the vapory cloud the glare of the incessant cannonading might be seen crimsoning the misty wreaths, which every shot angmented. “Hold! hold!” after awhile exclaimed Melendez, “let the smoke lift, this random firing goes for naught; let it lift, we shall see anon!” And at his orders instantly the firing from the battery stopped, but not for that did the dense vapors lift at all from the still surface of the waters, nor did the prospect brighten —fed constantly as were those murky clouds by the continual cannonading of the vessels, which in no degree ceased or abated. If the sight had been anxious heretofore, the interest appalling, when every motion of assailant or assailed might be distinctly noticed, what must have been the anguish now, the agony of expectation, when the fierce work of death was doing at their very doors, under the muzzles of their cannon, and they might neither see nor judge by any sense or sign, to which side fortune was inclining. The first sound that attracted any near attention, was the quick dash of oars close to the beach; and, as each countenance was instantly directed to the jouful echo, boat after boat of those—it needed not a second glance to tell it—which had been last seen towing shoreward El Santo Espiritu, loomed through the dusky veil, and, almost as they came in sight, grated upon the shingly beach; while their crews, throwing down their oars, rushed madly up the slope in desperate confusion towards the sally-port. “Ten thousand curses on the dogs!” fiercely hissed Juan de Melendez through his hard set teeth; “they have deserted her! but not the better shall they fare for that! level your arquebuses, guard; depress your culverins; sweep the deserting scoundrels from the earth!” But to his fiery command no answer was returned, and no obedience rendered; for during the last pause the firing had sunk, and from the bosom of the smoke, wild cheers, and all the tumult of heavy fight, were now distinctly audible. In a few seconds' space, the vapors gradually lightened, so that the vessels might be seen, though faintly, clustered together in close contact. Anon the breeze came up again, fitful at first and faint, but freshening at every moment; and then, whirled upward from the now rippling waters, the smoky masses were swept boldly to leeward, leaving the whole of the bright bay, the verdant shores, and the pure heavens rejoicing in the gorgeous sunshine. Far in the middle of that bay lay the devoted caravella, her sheets loosened and her canvas flying disorderly and wild, while grappling to her sides, her stern, her bows, the low barques of the pirates hemmed her in, their savage crews mounting her bulwarks in resistless numbers, their brandished weapons glancing to the sun, and their appalling yells deadening the hearts of all who heard them. Unharmed by the guns from the too distant ramparts, the light picaroons had succeeded in cutting in between the frigate and her boats, leaving no chance of safety to the latter but precipitate and sudden flight, and to the former no hope, save the precarious chances of a pirate's mercy. Nor was it long in doubt to the spectators what was that mercy; for ere the fight, or massacre, more properly, upon her decks had ceased, the wily desperadoes anchored just without cannon shot; and as the Spanish ensign was torn down, amid a tumult of tremendous exultation, man after man of the defendants was hurled overboard, so that their terror-stricken countrymen upon the battlements might see the waters, ever as they fell, lashed into froth and spray by the ferocious sharks, which, taught by their voracious instincts the consequence of battle, seized each one as he touched the surface, tugging and snapping at each other for every palpitating morsel. And still more terrible than this the howls of men—howls, such as nothing but the utmost and most excruciating tortures could force from human lips—mixed with the shriller and more piteous shrieks of women, told that the fate of those, who had become a prey to the disgusting fish, was but a boon of mercy when compared with the more awful doom of those preserved from the first carnage to satiate the victors' love of blood or beauty. All day long did this fearful sight continue—all day long were the heavens polluted by the atrocious deeds they were compelled to witness, pierced by the frantic cries of those who called on them in vain for succor or for mercy. The evening was now drawing nigh, although, perhaps, some three hours yet remained of daylight, when by a simultaneous movement of the frigate's decks, it might be judged that some new project had been fixed on by the buccaneers. Nor were the garrison devoid, if not of absolute fear, at least of much anxiety; since it was evident that their relentless enemies were in great force, not counting less, as they might calculate, from the known habits of the Caribbean pirates of stowing, in their long barques, as many men as possibly could be contained in them, than seven hundred, or perhaps a thousand soldiers; more fighting men than which St. Augustine could not, at that day, have turned out, though to preserve herself from utter ruin. Nor was it contrary by any means, or foreign to the policy of these far-dreaded rovers to attack villages, or even forts and cities, when in sufficient numbers to render success probable, and when enough of plunder or of licentious pleasure might be looked forward to, as the result of their bold daring! A levy of the citizens en masse was instantly resorted to, arms were distributed, even among the slaves, whose terrors, not inferior to those of their masters, rendered it safe to trust them with the weapon, which, at another time, they would have probably directed against the bosoms of the givers. Cannon were levelled, ammunition piled by every gun, and all precautions taken which could ensure a desperate resistance. The pallor and the gloom had passed away from the dark visage of Melendez, with the uncertainty which had so terribly distracted him. Sure as he felt himself now to be, that she, his treasured child, the only being on whom his stern soul doated, had endured the last and most appal ling woe that can befall a woman! that now her agonies—her innocence—her woes were at an end for ever! he had again resumed his soldierly and high demeanor! His face was deeply flushed, and his eyebrows contracted over the fiery orbs they shaded, till these could scarcely have been noted but for the flashes of fierce light which they, at times, shot forth. His lips alone were pale and ashy, so violent was their compression over his clenched teeth! “Would God,” said he, when every preparation was concluded, “would God, that they might try it! So should they feel a father's vengeance.” Nor did it seem improbable that his vengeful prayer would be immediately and fully granted; for now the pirate-barques might be observed to put off, one by one, from the dismantled and abandoned frigate; a single small boat only waiting, as it would seem, for their commander. Diverging slowly, and in opposite directions, but carefully preserving a safe distance from the batteries, they came to anchor each after each, the nearest about half a mile from their prize; and as the last swung round, the crew of the remaining skiff were seen getting, in all haste, to their oars. By aid of their naked eyes, the Spaniards now beheld a group of officers appear upon the bulwarks of the caravel, from which were lowered instantly three figures, two of which were females, into the cutter at the gangway. All, then, passed over the ship's side, but one, who disappearing for a moment through the cabin hatch, returned bearing a lighted flambeau; deliberately then he set on fire, in some twenty different places, the slighter cordage and the sails of the ill-fated ship, and ere he glided down a rope into his boat, the forked tongues of flame might be seen darting up the shrouds and masts like fiery serpents; and in a few short minutes, the whole of that magnificent and stately fabric, which had so lately walked the waters like a thing of life, was one huge pyramid of roaring and devouring flame. Strongly and rapidly did that boat's crew give way, and little time enough had they to place themselves in safety; for fired already in the hold before they left her, they had not traversed half the space between her and their nearest barque, before, with an explosion that might be heard leagues away into the pathless forest, startling the wild beast and the wilder Indian in his lair, and with a wide and circling glare that for an instant made the broad daylight pallid, the caravel blew up! A mass of pitchy smoke settled for a short space upon the water where she lay, and as it drifted seaward, a few rent planks and mouldering spars were all remaining of that noblest work of man's invention. After a little while, the skiff came to under the lee of the three-masted picaroon, and nothing more was seen by the excited Spaniards, until a burst of flame from a bow-port of the felucca, and the dull roar of an unshotted gun, woke their attention. With the report, down came the English ensign from the fore, down came the red flag from her peak, and in succession a broad white field, in sign of truce and amity, waved in the place of each. Upon the signal, each in succession of the pirates fired a leeward gun, and hoisted a white flag; and next, ere half an hour had elapsed, all the boats of the squadron, twenty at least in number, might be seen to put off from the barques, each bearing the same amicable signal at their bows; and after joining, which they did at the first practicable point, to pull on steadily, in beautiful and accurate array, towards the shore. Eagerly did the Spaniards watch these singular manœuvres, and with keen scrutiny did they observe each several barge; but it was not until they had arrived within a short space of the beach, that they might make out clearly the forms and features of those who occupied them. Nor could they as yet do this to their satisfaction, when observing that no flag of truce was displayed from the ramparts, they became stationary, just without the surf, pulling a stroke or two at times merely to hold their own, for the tide was now fast ebbing. Scarce had they halted, before a figure rose up in the bow of the central boat—a powerful barge pulling with forty oars—and waving a white flag about his head, shouted some words, which did not reach, however, the ears for which they were intended, although there could be no doubt of their import. “Shall we respond to their signal, fair Senor?” exclaimed the veteran Diego; “I trow 'twere best to answer them! it may be well; they hold some of our friends to ransom!” “No truce; no flag!” fiercely replied Melendez, “I waited but to get them within our point blank range! take good sight, cannoniers! look to your match! fi—” “Hold! for God's sake, hold!” cried young Don Amadis, leaping before the muzzle of the gun, and grasping by the arm the impetuous governor. “See you not there,” and with the eyes almost starting from his head, and lips apart, and outstretched hands, he pointed to the signal boat. “See you not it is she?” Slowly Melendez caught his meaning— turned his glass towards the barge, wherein the quick eye of the youthful lover had detected the form of his intended bride—dropped it from his unnerved and powerless hand, and with a quick shrill cry, “My daughter—my Teresa!” sank helpless as a child into the arms of his attendants; while, catching instantly their cue, the cannoniers flung down their linstocks, and in three minutes' time a flag of truce was waving in the place of Castile's gorgeous blazonry. CHAPTER II. Scarcely had the white flag of truce replaced the castled blazonry of Spain, before a loud hail rang from boat to boat throaghout the pirate squadron, and the large forty-oared barge leading, they pulled so swiftly shoreward, that scarce a moment seemed to have elapsed before the whole flotilla was battling against the heavy surf that tumbled in, with its deep booming roar, upon the narrow strip of sand which lay between the bastions and the sea—and scarce another passed before they were beached high and dry, with their oars shipped, in easy shot of arquebuse from water-gate and demi-lune. A more superb and gorgeous spectacle can hardly be imagined, than was presented to the eye on the disembarkation of the buccaneers; for such at that time were the profits of their lawless and unholy trade, that not the meanest mariner who toiled before the mast, but had his gala suit of velvet and embroidery, his silken hose, his arms inlaid with gold and silver, and his rich chain of precious metal about his brawny neck; and, as it ever was their wont when on the eve of battle to don their most magnificent attire, all now, from the great captain downward to the humblest rower, were decked in such pomp as to put to shame even the splendid uniforms of the Castilian cavaliers. It was, however, on the great barge that every eye was riveted; for in her bow a group was seated, that must have awakened the most lively interest even in a stranger's bosom—upon a pile of cushions covered with crimson damask, a portion evidently of the spoil snatched from the hapless caravella, exposed to the full glare of the burning sun, reclined a girl of most rare loveliness. Sixteen or seventeen years at the utmost had passed over her fair head, but they were years of a ripe southern climate, and so just was the rich swelling outline of her every limb, so perfect the development of her whole figure, that in less genial regions she would have been taken for a woman of some four or five-and-twenty summers. Her complexion was of that rich and sunny tint peculiar to the most lovely regions of the European continent; her hair black as the raven's wing, and, if it be possible, even more lustrous— although it had been braided closely above her high pale brow—disordered now, and torn from its symmetrical arrangement, flowed in dishevelled masses over her neck and shoulders; while one or two stray stresses falling upon a bosom, that might have vied in beauty with that of the Medicean Venns, afforded a strange contrast by their jetty blackness, to the almost unnatural whiteness of the pure spotless flesh, on which they rested—for not her tresses only, but all her vestments had been disarranged and rent by the licentious grasp of ruffian hands; the graceful folds of the mantilla were no longer there, to lend their friendly shade to those sweet modest features; the full basquina of dark silk had been stript violently from those lovely limbs, now all too much disclosed through the thin draperies of the single linen garment, which a precarious mercy had conceded to her virgin blushes. Nor had this wretched boon been granted as it would seem without reluctance, perhaps without the violent interposition of some powerful protector; for from the neck quite downward to the girdle, it had been riven open by some cruel hand, which had left on its sullied folds the distinct score of five ensanguined fingers, and now fell wide apart, revealing to the wanton sunbeams one sloping ivory shoulder, and the whole of the voluptuous bosom, which never had before been so unveiled, even to the chaste glance of the maiden moon. Her exquisitely rounded arms, bare to the shoulders, were bound fast behind her back, and the small foot which peeped forth from below the hem of the chemise, was not unsandalled only, but encrusted with a deep crimson coat of human gore, contracted from the bloody decks of the ill-fated caravella. At the feet of this lovely being, whose cheeks, pallid with agony and terror, had long forgot to blush in the extremity of anguish, bound like her mistress and yet more brutally despoiled of her apparel, crouched a negro girl, whose skin, of the most polished jet, relieved the pale complexion of the Spanish lady, even as a pedestal of sable marble sets off a statue wrought in snow white alabaster. A little way apart from these, there lay a slender stripling, whose unfledged chin was not yet clothed with the first down of manhood, fettered so torturingly hand and foot, that the blood oozed in large broad gouts from the pores of his swollen limbs; while a long gash on his forehead, about which his close-curled locks were stiff with clotted gore, and his whole person swart with the smoke of gunpowder, and dabbled with the blood of both himself and his assailants, showed plainly that his desperate resistance had been the cause of these unnatural and needless bonds. Erect behind this miserable group, standing aloft upon the rocking thwarts, as firmly as if his feet were planted on the solid earth, one finger of his right hand slightly leaning against the slender staff, whence waved the flag of truce, towered far above the rest, one whose commanding aspect and proud bearing, no less than his gorgeous dress, at once bespoke him the commander of the buccaneers. Six feet at least in height, broad shouldered, and deep-chested, his person, notwithstanding, was so admirably rounded, his waist so slender, and all his limbs so just in their proportions, so compact in their easy contour, that the extraordinary and almost Herculean power of his frame was not observable, but on a close and accurate survey. His lineaments were, although wearing a mingled expression of licentiousness, effrontery, and daring, decidedly regular and even handsome; nor was there any line or trait which could betoken cruelty or fierceness. The eyes of a deep greyish blue, although large and well-opened, were rather sleepy than the reverse, in their ordinary aspect: while of the mouth, that most expressive feature of the face, the most decided character—blended with much of firm and dauntless resolution, and no little of contemptuous haughtiness—was passionate voluptuousness. He wore no hair upon his face, which, though much sunburnt, and even swarthy from exposure to the fierce sun of the tropics, was by no means flushed or ruddy—neither mustache nor whisker—except one peaked tuft upon his lower lip, many shades darker than the sunny locks which fell in natural curls over the collar of his doublet. The garments of this remarkable figure were no less striking than his personal appearance. Upon his head, set very much to the right, so as to leave the waving ringlets of the other side free to the breeze and sunshine, he had a small cap of dark purple velvet, encircled by three folds of a delicate chain, or fanfarona—the workmanship of which, although the metal was pure gold, surpassed in value its material—and further decorated by a single ostrich-feather, near half an ell in length, of perfect whiteness. Over a full-sleeved vest of snowy satin, fastened at the bosom by a dozen buttons— each one a solid pearl as large as a hazel-nut —all linked together by a slight Venetian chain, he wore a sleeveless coat of the same velvet with his cap, laced down the seams with gold, lined with white silk, and decked with pendant studs of gold filagree, and loops of bullion. White satin breeches, and white silken hose with gold clocks, and red-heeled shoes, completed his attire; but round his waist was twisted a sash of purple network. entwined with strands of gold, from which hung at the opposite sides his basket-hilted rapier, and a long two-edged dagger in a shark-skin scabbard—while a broad baldric of the same materials, thrown over his right shoulder, supported not less than six pistols of rare workmanship and finish. The rowers who propelled this powerful barge, were all attired in velvet caps and jerkins, with plumes, and scarfs of costly silk, and chains of gold and jewelry—and, like their leader, were all armed to the teeth with cutlass, dirk, and pistols; while through the whole length of the vessel were stacked, ready to their hands, the heavy musquetoons or carbines of the day. The crews of the other boats, which swept on, all abreast, scarce an oar's length asunder, were adorned with equal splendor; and as they leaped ashore, and fell into a serried line, with ported carbines—seven hundred men in number at the smallest calculation—a more magnificent array can scarcely be conceived, than was drawn up before the gaze of the dismayed and anxious Spaniards. After a pause of a few minutes, which seemed ages to the distracted father, who had recovered from his swoon to a full sense of his anguish, the splendid captain of the pirates advanced alone, a pistol shot in front of the well-ordered buccaneers, followed at a respectful distance by four others, whose dress, as sumptuous, though less tasteful than that of their superior, betokened them the officers of the inferior vessels. Behind these men, again, stepped forth as many privates, two and two, leading between them the damsel and the stripling, who, with the negro maiden, were now the sole survivors from about two hundred souls, the crew and passengers of the proud frigate, of which not now a wreck remained, to tell how she had sailed the deep in fleet and fearless beauty. “Ho! Juan de Melendez”—he exclaimed, when he had drawn so near the walls, that every accent of his deep voice could be heard with ease—“Juan Melendez de Aviles, I summon thee forthwith to yield this city, and these forts, named of St. Augustine, to our mercy!” He spoke in pure Castilian Spanish, though with a trifling foreign accent; so light indeed, that but to an ear well practised it would not have been at all perceptible. “And who art thou, who summonest so boldly?”—returned the governor, manning himself to endure the torture, which his high sense of duty and of honor told him he might not even hope to shun—“and what hast thou to set forth as a reasonable cause, why we, the armed and numerous possessors of strong works mounting much and heavy ordnance, well found and victualled for a six months' siege, should yield us to a handful, without artillery to batter our defences, or ladders to assail our ramparts!” “I—if it could avail thee anything to know”—replied the pirate, his lip writhing as he spoke, with bitter scorn—“I am called Ringwood—Reginald Ringwood, once of merry England—Think, Juan Melendez, think! If thine ear may not find something familiar in that sound—ask thy false heart to prompt it!—and for a cause—behold these arguments!—perchance, though thine eye may not recognise a man whom thy tongue, scarce six years ago, styled friend and brother, it may be more successful in deciphering the lineaments of this girl-like stripling!” “And what of these?” replied the father, struggling vainly to conceal the agonies of his paternal terrors—“what of these innocent, defenceless children!—or what have they to make with the rendition of this city?” “Innocent—and defenceless!” sneered the buccaneer, “and knew not Juan de Aviles, any child, ever, as innocent—as defenceless —as—nay, ten thousand times more—lovely and more loved—to whom, nor beauty, nor innocence, nor helplessness, availed anything? Now, by the great God, Spaniard,” he continued, lashing himself as he went on into a state of fierce and terrible excitement, “now, by the great God, Spaniard, that shall judge between us two, thou hast but sealed thy doom! What, dost thou ask, have these to make with the rendition of this city! This!—very simply this! That if, within one hour, the city be not rendered to our pleasure, your boy shall die upon the beach before thine eyes, by such variety of torture, as never yet racked human sinews! And for the girl—thou shalt behold her undergo things, fifty—nay! but fifty thousand times more terrible than death protracted and made horrible by the most lingering torments. Choose! thou hast but one hour!” “And what if we should render us—not that the mere thought of such a deed is possible!”—quivering with anguish in every iron limb, the Spaniard answered—“what terms dost thou offer if we should render us?” “Life!” was the stern reply. “Life to the soldiers of the garrison, and liberty to march out with their arms and three rounds of munition! We know your numbers, fair sir, far too well to dread them! Thy son and daughter shall be restored to thee unhurt —for the rest we will hold the city for three days' space, using all property, all persons therein, as our own—and at the three days' end, we take with us whatsoe'er we list! up anchors! and sheet topsails home! and farewell to fair St. Augustine!” With an unutterable air of blank dismay, the officers upon the bastion gazed in each other's faces. The terms were such as men could not endure—and the alternative scarce less appalling! The agony, the mute, despairing, ghastly torture depicted in every speaking feature—in the dull, scarcely conscious air of Juan's eye, in the convulsive writhing of his pale ashy lip, from which the gnawing teeth, though they bit deep and keenly, could force no drop of blood— were scarcely more heartrending than the tremendous bursts of passionate and impotent phrensy, with which the youthful lover—the noble, brave, and beautiful Don Amadis, raved with mad gestures and wild imprecations, to and fro the ramparts. “Beware!” after a long, awful interval, during which he had gloated with a mixed expression of pleasure, exultation, and contempt, over the evident misery of the man whom, as his dark words and half-uttered hints implied, he had good cause to hate, with that unbending and insatiate hatred, which, if intensity may give any token whereby to estimate duration, may survive even death itself. “Beware, I say!” cried Ringwood, “and now, I speak in mercy! Beware, I say, how thou decidest. For by my wrongs, the depth of which none know so well as thou! and by my love for her—which such a soul—if any soul, indeed, be thine—so base, and sensual, and brutish—cannot so much as fancy! and by those hopes of vengeance, which alone have thus far sustained me, blighted though I be, and blasted—to gain which I have lived, and which, once gained, I will die happy—by all these solemn things, I swear to thee, if thou refuse my proffer, I will not bate one jot of this which I have threatened! Nay, more! this done—for fancy not thy paltry walls or boasted ordnance could for ten minutes' space oppose, much more bear back, our onset—this done, I say—we will be masters of your city, spite earth, or hell, or heaven!—and, masters of it, not one woman, from the grandame of fourscore, or the fresh virgin of fourteen, shall escape the worst pollution! not one man, nor one boy, nay! not the babe that is unborn, shall flee the sword's edge—not one building, from God's temple down to the wretched negro's kennel, but shall share the all-devouring flame! Before to-morrow's dawn, if ye submit not to my terms, there shall not be one living thing!—there shall not be one stone upon another, to tell the story of your ruin! Choose, then—choose wisely—but see that ye choose likewise very shortly! One hour! I have spoken!” “Thou speakest mere impossibilities”—replied the miserable father—“and that full well thou knowest! For how—were I so minded —should I compel all these to yield their homes to conflagration—their children to the sword—their women to dishonor! Ask anything but this, and on the instant it shall be performed!” “Thou hast heard!”—was the stern reply —“and I have said!” “If thou wouldst have wealth, say the word —our swollen treasuries would suffice to glut the wildest avarice.” “I have said!” answered the pirate, fiercely, dashing his heel with furious energy into the yielding sand—“I have said—nor would the gold of El Dorado buy thee one moment's mercy!” “If vengeance—I—I, Juan Melendez—I whom you hate so deadly—I will come forth to ye unarmed—I will yield me to the utmost of your malice—yea! I will bless your torments, so these may return harmless!” “And I”—exclaimed Don Amadis Ferrajo, springing with outstretched arms upon the battlements—“high privilege it were to die for thee, Teresa!” “And I—and I—and I”—responded twenty voices, in a breath, of the hold cavaliers, who stood upon the bastion; and who, till now, dispirited and cowed by the sight of anguish which they might neither heal nor hinder, kindled to sudden animation at the high hope of rescuing, by their own self-devoting gallantry, those innocent and spotless victims, blazed forth in all the lustre of their Castilian chivalry at the proud words of Amadis. A low and sneering laugh was the sole answer, for the vengeful buccaneer, as he perceived by the increasing agitation of the Spaniards the full extent of his advantage, waxed but the firmer and the cooler for all their menaces and prayers. “Monster!—ha! devil!”—shouted the fiery Amadis, goaded by the calm and contemptuous air of Ringwood, into a state of utter phrensy—“devil! thou shalt not live to boast of it!”—and snatching, as he spoke, a long-barrelled arquebuse from a sentinel beside him, he took a rapid aim, and before any of his comrades could interpose to hinder him—for all perceived the madness of the action—fired it against the head of the proud Rover. He was a practised and a steady marksman, was that hot-blooded gallant: nor, had his soul's salvation been staked upon the shot, could his aim have been more accurate or guarded. Before the sharp report had reached any of the tremulous spectators who gazed, as though their all was perilled by the deed —almost before the flash had gleamed upon their eyes—the long white plume, which graced the cap of Ringwood, was cut sheer off within an inch or less of his unblenching head; and was borne away, glancing, and fluttering like a sea-bird's wing over the sparkling billows, by the light western breeze. With a wild yell of savage execration, the pirate line rushed forward. But scarcely had they made six steps, with brandished arms and furious gestures, towards the Spanish works, before the loud clear voice of their commander was heard, as composed and slow as though he had been speaking to a comrade across the festive board!— “Halt! ho!—is this your discipline?”— and his right hand raised quietly aloft, without a sign of menace—scarce even of authority—sufficed upon the instant to arrest those hardy desperadoes, that they stood motionless and silent as a rank of statues. “And this”—he said, turning, his eyes, with a scornful smile upon his lips towards the ramparts—“this is your Spanish honor— this your respect for the white flag, which even savage and heathen venerate! Excellent well! young man! excellent well, and wisely was it done; 'Tis like that these would be more merciful, seeing their captain slaughtered here, before their face, under a flag of truce! Had I been other than I am, this gallant deed might have anticipated, somewhat, the time when these shall suffer. As it is neither for fear nor favor—neither for anger nor remorse—hath Ringwood ever swerved—be it for good or evil—from his word! nor can so slight a thing as thou move his most slight resolve, more than the summer wind can lift the earth-fast oak from its abiding place. I said an hour—the half of it has flown—half yet remains to ye, to sport, or grieve, as it seems best to ye!—that past, the boy here dies in torment. The girl lives for our pleasure, and our scorn!” Even before the fierce rush of the pirates had been made, the officers around had seized the youthful lover and disarmed him, reproaching him unsparingly for the insane and desperate deed to which his uncurbed passions had excited him—“Amadis—Amadis,” cried the greyheaded veteran Diego, “thank God upon your knees—with your whole heart, and strength, and spirit, thank him, that your mad effort failed. Had thy shot struck down him at whom it was so deadly aimed—she, whom thou lovest, had been lost, past hope, past redemption!” “Young man,” exclaimed the fiery governor, rendered more fierce than ever he was wont, by the increase of peril to his children, by that most inconsiderate action; “young man, hidalgo though thou be, and belted knight of Calatrava, I swear to thee, had that shot taken place, I would have stripped and bound thee like a dog, and hurled thee headlong from the bastions. As it is, if aught ill befall my children, to thee I lay it—see thou be ready to make full atonement: for—” Ere he had finished speaking, with a shriek so tremendous, that to describe its tones, or even its effects on those who, shaken as they were by the dread scenes enacting in their sight, were harrowed to the very soul by that appalling cry, were utterly impossible—a female of some forty-five or even fifty years, but still remarkable for matronly majestic beauty, with her long hair dishevelled, and her large dark eyes glaring terribly, rushed up the narrow steps, and stood unveiled with all her garments in wild disarray, among the group of warriors. “My children!” she cried—“Oh! God! God! my children!” None spoke—none had words, or breath, or heart, to speak to her—and she went on, mingling the wildest, the most eloquent appeals to Heaven for mercy and for succor, with yells and shrieks, that made the very hair to bristle on the heads, and the chilled blood to curdle in the veins of all who heard her—even of the unpitying, unsparing desperadoes, who, though they shuddered at they knew not what, swerved not in their fell purpose, nor ever even dreamed of mercy. And now she would blaspheme, and rave with execrations, such as had scarcely been outdone by the profanity of the most desperate of men; calling down curses on the heads alike of those who held her children prepared for instant execution—of those who could not, howsoever they might pant to do so, strike one blow for the rescue, without insuring by that blow, more certainly than ever, now it was decreed, their doom- and on her own head, most of all—for that she had borne, and nursed them at her breast, and trained them up so pure, and beautiful, and brave —and all for such an end! Once Juan drew his sword—once almost gave the word, to cast the sally-port wide open —to rush down with pike, and arquebuse, and rapier, under cover of the volleying cannon—to cry, “St. Jago and God aid!”—to set all on the cast of one desperate charge! But hope and prudence conquered. It cannot be, he thought—his hopes suggesting arguments which his more sober reason would at once have discovered as nothing worth—for well did Juan Melendez know the unbending spirit, the tameless, heaven-daring pride, the dauntless valor of the man who stood beforr him—not now, as once, a wronged and helpless exile, but in the plenitude of power, and pride, and vengeance! It cannot be that a mere buccaneer, a sordid, selfish pirate would—or would be permitted to—surrender his, or his comrades' common interest for any private vengeance, how grateful or how sweet soever. And in these frantic hopes, mingled with fears, if possible, more frantic, the fatal moment passed. “Juan!” once more exclaimed the deep sonorous accents of the Englishman—“Juan Melendez de Aviles, the hour I gave thee hath elapsed—once more I ask of thee—shall these two live or die? If thou wouldst have them live, down draw-bridge, up portcullis, and march out, thou and thy veterans, and thy family—for three days will we hold the city, doing to it, and all within it, as to us shall seem fitting—after three days will we embark in our good ships and trouble ye no more, here at St. Augustine—and for assurance that we will preserve our faith with ye, myself will be hostage in your hands—even in yours, the deadliest of my foemen! Choose now— choose, choose, Juan Melendez, and if thou doomest these—these thine own flesh and blood, on whom even I, who have such cause to hate them, scarce can look without piety— if thou do this, say not that it is I, but thou who art their slayer!” The brow of Ringwood, as he spoke, grew very pale, and his lips absolutely ashy in their tints. Yet his eye was as bright, and even calm as ever; and not a muscle worked, or a nerve quivered, in those stern features, or that stately frame. “Mercy!” exclaimed Melendez, stretching forth his clasped hands towards the pirate, “mercy. As thou mayest, one day, ask for it thyself—show mercy!” “As I received it, one day, at thine hands, when I did crave it, so will I show it, Juan,” replied the buccaneer. “Speak now, speak out, I say! Wild thou yield up the town?” “I will not,” answered Melendez, very firmly. “God help me—I will do my duty.” “Then hear me—thy son will I torture here to death before thy very eyes—thy daughter, if thou move not to sally, for the time, is safe —if but the bridge be lowered, or one shot fired, I yield her on the instant to the mercy of my crew. Lead out the boy!” And that pale stripling was led out before his father's face—pale, indeed, even to ghastiless, partly from the loss of blood, and partly from the conscious horror of his situation. Yet he bore up with dauntless courage, and, though a mere boy, proved himself, in that extremity, a worthy scion of his proud race. “Teresa,” he said, as he left his sister's side, “God bless thee, and farewell, and may He grant that I may bear this agony for both. Father, let me see that you look as bravely on my death, as I shall bear it; unman me not by any weakness; I would die as becomes thy son, and a Castilian. Now, sir, I am ready.” It was a most strange sight. The lip of Ringwood quivered, as he looked on the brave boy, and all the muscles of his face, which had hitherto been as tense and cold as steel, relaxed a little, and a tear swam in his grey eye; he was, it seemed, on the point of yielding. But with a mighty effort he dashed off the growing weakness. “I, too,” he said, “painful, although it be, and bitter, I too have my duty.” He gave a sign to the assistants, and they made the boy kneel down upon the sands, and bound a knotted whipcord closely about his temples, and thrust between it and the flesh the stout steel-mounted stock of a ship-pistol. One strong man seized each arm, and held him steady by the full exertion of their united strength! Having made that one signal, Ringwood cast no glance more towards the hapless boy, but riveted his eagle eye, with an intense expression of horrible exulting pleasure, full on the father's face. “It is done, captain,” whispered the third of those fell satellites. “Proceed!” replied the Rover, never removing once his eyes from the distorted features of the governor. “Proceed!” And at the word, the wretch who had last spoken, seizing the pistol by the barrel, twisted it round and round, tightening at every strain the knotted cord till it pierced through the skin, and flesh, and sinews, and pressed with agonizing keenness into the solid bone itself. Manfully—wonderfully—did that pale stripling bear the intense anguish—anguish, the horrible extremity of which was but too well displayed by the deep crimson flush, which had supplanted the ghastly whiteness of his brow—in the foam that flew from his churning teeth, in the dark sweat that gushed from every pore. Still he so mastered that appalling torture, that he spoke not a word, nor groaned, nor even murmured! Had the fierce Rover looked but once on that boy's face, he had forgotten all his wrongs, all his deep hatred, in overwhelming admiration. He would have cried—had the cry sealed his own eternal doom —“hold! hold!” for shame if not for mercy! But he did not look on it—for his hard eyes were drinking in, with fearful satisfaction, the tortures visible in the dark features of his humbled foeman! At length the tough cord pierced its way into the skull itself; the sightless eyes, forced from their sockets, started out upon the gory cheeks; one loud long yell burst from the boy's lips, and at the self-same instant Don Juan Melendez fell back into the arms of his attendants, in such a paroxysm of despair and agony, as happily deprived him of all consciousness for hours. The yet more wretched mother had been forced from the bastions forcibly, before that hellish scene commenced, or she had perished at the sight! As Ringwood saw his enemy fall senseless, as the boy's yell pierced his scarce conscious ears, a deep flush crossed his brow; he snatched a pistol from his baldric, turned short upon his wretched victim, and fired full at the head, not three feet distant from the muzzle. One spasm—one quick convulsive shudder—and all was over, ere yet the echoes of the death-shot had subsided! Was that an echo—that deep sullen roar? Again! again! No! 'Tis the sound of ordnance! And lo! in clear sight, on the bright horizon, four pyramids of sail, looming up larger and more near, as every second passes. And now what floats above those lofty royals—what but the yellow flag with the three eastles of Castile? Hark! to that cheer, awful, and deep, and solemn, which rushes up to heaven from the beleaguered ramparts, full of a thousand mingled feelings—of gratitude for unexpected safety—of hope for coming vengeance! CHAPTER III. Well was it for the buccaneers, that the wind died away, which had brought into sight so rapidly the Spanish caravellas; for had the four tall frigates which, deserted by the sea breeze, were soon obliged to drop their anchors at the very entrance of the bay, four miles at least from the vessels of the pirates—been able to run in, the small light picaroons of the Rovers, heavily armed although they were in proportion to their rate and burden, would have stood but a sorry chance, hemmed in between the heavy batteries of those floating castles to the seaward, and the yet heavier cannon of the ramparts, should they attempt to run into shoal water. It was evident, moreover, that the newly-arrived ships were already in no small degree suspicious of the character and intentions of the squadron moored in shore; as appeared from the quick interchange of signals, between the Spanish flag-ship, which was the first to anchor, and her comrades. In obedience to these signals, the four tall vessels came to anchor, all nearly in a line, at equal distances across the harbor, so as to render escape difficult, if not impossible—and in a few moments afterward, in consequence of a fresh signal shown at the mast-head, a second cable was carried out from the stern of every frigate, and she was warped round, till she lay broadside to the bay with all her frowning batteries commanding the long expanse of water, across which the picaroons must sail exposed to their raking fire, if they should seek to force a passage. The distance and the apparently hopeless position of the buccaneers preventing the Spaniards, as it would seem, from sending their boats' crews to ascertain their character, if not to cut them out and capture them. It must not be supposed that it took the keen and practised intellect of Ringwood so long a time to apprehend his own position, and the intentions of the enemy, as it has occupied us to describe them. On the contrary, they had not dropped their anchors, before he had envisaged fully the extent of his own danger, and calculated accurately the chances of effecting his escape, under circumstances which seemed so unpromising. Forming his men into four columns, he commanded them to retreat by turns, one body facing the ramparts with levelled arquebuse, and pike in rest, while another fell back, till they had all reached the gravelly margin of the bay. Then judging from the movements on the walls and above the gate, that a sally was about to be attempted, he strode out alone, till he was within earshot, and then shouted aloud— “Beware!—beware how ye raise gate, or lower bridge, or do but so much as to threaten our retreat!—for as ye do so, by Him who knoweth all things! the fate of this crushed clay,”—and he pointed with a meaning smile to the dead body of the young Melendez—“the fate of this crushed clay shall be a lot of perfect bliss compared with that which shall light on your sweet daughter!” And with the words he fell back slowly to his men, the greater part of whom were already on board their boats, leaving the Spaniards dispirited, and faint, and sick with hope deferred. Within a short half hour, the whole flotilla was in motion, dashing up the clear azure of the peaceful bay, with hundreds of strong oars, and ere the hour was well accomplished, each picaroon had received its complement, had hoisted in its boats, and lay, all hands at quarters, ready for action. When Ringwood reached the deck of his felucca, ordering that his captive should be conveyed without delay to his own private cabin, he took to his perspective glass and gazed steadily and long toward the Spanish caravellas, and far beyond them towards the open sea. “A mist!” he cried anon, after examining both sea and sky with anxious scrutiny—“a mist, coming in slowly from the seaward!— masthead there!—signalize the captains of the squadron to come aboard me here to council,”—and with the word up went three balls to the masthead, and bursting as they reached the summit, streamed out for one moment three bright contrasted signals. Within five minutes after, a little cutter might be seen to be launched from the side of every picaroon, and darting towards the principal felucca, as fast as oars could urge it through the water; yet still the Rover swept the horizon round and round with his telescope, minutely watching every sign and symptom of the weather, fixing his gaze most constantly on a point directly landward, where just above the tree-tops one small dark cloud with snow-white edges was visible —quite motionless—and unconnected, as it seemed, with any mass of vapor, the single frown of the bright laughing heavens—the single frown, full of dread menace. Just as the first of the small pinnaces came alongside, his scrutiny was ended, and he closed his glass, saying to himself with a quiet smile of satisfaction: “A mist forthwith from the sea-ward—and when the sunset is fully passed, a hurricane and land tornado! Ha! Master Cunninghame,” he added, as his second in command stepped on board, a handsome, fresh-complexioned, fair-haired Saxon. “Ha! Monsieur Le Fort—welcome, good friends and comrades Winslow and Drake! welcome, friends, all! I have convoked you hither to study how we may escape scot-free from these toils, that now seem set so close about us. And before heaven!—I hold the clue, my masters. See ye, how dark this sea-mist is now gathering? The Spaniards must lie still till it blow over —and then look yonder, to the bright edges of yon black cloud. Ere midnight we shall have a land tornado—then must you Spanish lubbers slip their stern cables, and swing head to sea; and then will we run up to them under slight storm-sails, and, it may be, slip by them unperceived in the deep gloom—if not engage them and force passage. Lo! here, my masters, when I shall fire a bow gun hold all ready to cut or slip your cables! and when I hoist three lanthorns at my main, then run! You, Drake and Winslow, since that your vessels draw least water, steer you betwixt the headlands of the hay, on the right hand and left, and those two outward frigates. I will steer straight between the central two; ye, Cunninghame and Le Fort, make good your way between the others, on either hand of me—when ye are all at sea, fire each a weather gun, and burn a blue light and three rockets—then each make all sail for the inlet, and so huzza for home! And one word more, my friends, before we part—it will blow sturdily, I warrant me—send down all light spars and top hamper—have your ships snug and easy, with naught abroad but a small rag of head-sail, so to steer. Have out your sweeps, too,—to get yourselves before the wind, if need be—none may tell certainly where the tornado may strike first—farewell, be brave and fortunate, and see ye reach your vessels ere this fog commence, since of a surety ye scarce will find their berths, when once the mist gets settled. So, my friends, once more, fare ye well!” And with these words, accustomed long ago to place complete reliance on the opinion of that skilful navigator, and to yield with instinctive readiness to his least mandate, his four commanders entered their boats, and hurried to their several vessels, although in truth they saw no symptoms—even when pointed out by his unerring judgment—of the approaching changes in the weather which their great chief prognosticated so decidedly. Not long was it, however, that they doubted, if indeed it may be said that they did doubt at all; for though they marvelled, and looked anxiously about to note some confirmation of their leader's prophecy, they did not for a moment presume to doubt their leader's accuracy—for ere they had all reached their vessels, the thin haze which had for some time floated on the extreme horizon's edge, grew thick and heavy—and by and by came rolling onward in deep and ponderous masses, although no breath of air could be discovered, by which it was urged landward; and the whole atmosphere grew damp and watery. Then one by one the caravellas of the enemy were swallowed up in the dense gloom, and then their own low rakish picaroons became so indistinct and dim, that those which lay furthest from the felucca of the great English buccaneer were not reached by their officers without much difficulty and some hazard. Long before sunset, nothing was visible from the deck of any one of that small pirate squadron, but the calm surface of the unmoved sea, and that within a circle of only some fifty yards at the utmost, beyond which all was one dead drowsy mass of impenetrable vapor. Yet so well had the officers taken the bearings of the enemy, of the headlands, and of their consorts, that there was not one of their number who was not as fully acquainted with the position of everything about him, as he could have been had the whole scene been laughing out in clear broad sunshine. All day the crews were mustered, and toiling at their several stations, and night was advanced somewhat, ere all the preparations were completed; the loftier spars sent down, the masts housed safely, and the lighter sails unbent, the rigging taughtened, and the masts fortified with preventers against the coming tempest; the guns run out and loaded, the matches lighted, and the armed crews at quarters; the heavy sweeps already in the water and ready, at a word's notice, to be worked by powerful strong-handed gangs; the carpenter and his stout mates, prepared with their broad axes to sever the strong cables at a blow, and let the gallant barks shoot sea-ward! The sun had long since sunk into the waves, and the deep palpable obscure of night been added to the gloom of the thick fog-wreaths—no stars were in the sky, no moon, “hid in her vacant interlunar cave,” hung forth her silver lamp in the dark vault; for clouds, heavy and packed and solid, had long since overspread the sky, though not a human eye had marked them, swelling from out that one small spot of vapor, till they had blotted out each light of the broad empyrean, from the horizon upward to the zenith. Midnight was near at hand—when a deep, rumbling roar, as of ten thousand chariots rolling upon a strong causeway, rushed up from the landward; and, after filling the air for some short space, sank gradually down into a faint, sick moan—unlike to any sound of earth, or air, or water. It ceased; and as it did so the sharp and ringing discharge of a long brazen culverin burst in a sheet of flame from the lee bow-port of the Rover's galley—and scarcely had its echoes died away, before a wide, blue sulphurous glare seemed to rush downward bodily from the black skies with such a roar of thunder, crash upon crash, and peal succeeding peal, as stunned the sternest soul. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the misty wreaths were swept sea-ward and vanished; leaving, however, the night quite as dark as ever; and as they did so, up shot to Ringwood's mainmast head three glittering lanthorns—sparkled there for a moment—and were quenched instantly, by the fierce whirling breath of the tornado. Bearing on its mad pinions huge limbs fresh rent from the tall forest trees, whirling the level surface of the calm bay into a series of huge and snow-capped billows, and anon sweeping away the heads of those vast waves, and beating them down bodily into the deep, till the whole bosom of the sea was one wide, white expanse of scattering, hissing spray—roaring and howling—yea! yelling in its furious might —soon came the tropical tornado! But every cable was cut sheer, before it struck the water, throughout the Rover's squadron—the sweeps were out and manned; the picaroons all under weigh and steering, when the fierce blast fell on their naked spars and scanty canvas, and drove them, like beings full of fiery life, bounding across the waters. When the mist cleared away, the Spanish caravellas were descried, not by their outlines —for no human eye could trace an outline against the swart gloom of the sky—but by the broad glare of the battle lanthorns, gleaming out from their open port-holes, as they lay broadside towards the bay, all manned and cleared for action; so that her course was definite and clear to each one of the picaroons. But when the dreadful howl of the tornado came raving through the tortured air, their stern springs were all slipped at once, and they came heavily round, head to sea, upon the instant; and more cable was paid out; and though they rolled and labored fearfully, yet they rode still secure, amid the frightful uproar. No light was seen, no voice or sound was heard on deck of any one of Ringwood's squadron; as driving with the speed of light before the raging hurricane, they neared the lofty Spaniards—but loud and violent was the confusion and the din aboard the castled caravellas. Unseen and unsuspected, leading the van of his little fleet, the Rover rushed into the space between the central frigates, and so rapidly did he shoot through, betwixt those motionless and vast masses, that the scared crews had scarcely time to note his transit; yet did the fearful volley, which he poured forth from each broadside, as he rushed past, plunge fatally and fast into their clustered masts —and when they sprang in tarn to their guns, and fired their answering salvos, the picaroon had shot already a cable's length ahead, and the two Spanish ships received each other's shot, thinning their crews more fatally than had the Rover's broadside, cutting away their rigging, piercing their castled sides, and shearring their spars fearfully of their dimensions. Under the cover of this disastrous chance, Cunninghame and Le Fort passed undiscovered, with their guns undischarged, within half pistol shot on the outside of these same two caravellas; and when the Rover, half a mile now to sea-ward, fired his weather gun, burnt his blue lights, and sent his rockets up kindling the murky skies with their clear sparkles, these two responded on the instant, with ready tokens of their safety. Almost at the same point of time a heavy cannonade was heard from the two outward caravellas, and scarce ten minutes later, the two remaining picaroons signalled their comrades through the gloom. Such was the desperate and daring feat, long famous as the master deed of naval warfare in that remote and early age, by which the English buccaneer ran, with five petty picaroons, the gauntlet of Spain's noblest caravellas, in safety and triumph—losing no man, no spar, no rope, how trivial it might be soever, bearing his captive with him, and leaving to his baffled foes sorrow, and anguish, and despair. Ere long the hurricane subsided, but still the breeze blew swift, and sure, and steady— and swiftly danced the roving barques before it. All night it blew, and all night long the Rover paced the deck; but when the daylight broke over the foaming ocean, and when he swept the free horizon with his glass, and saw his coasorts dancing merrily behind him, and not a sail save theirs in sight, whether of foe or stranger, he gave his deck in charge to the next officer, and sought his private cabin, and his unhappy captive. CHAPTER IV. The cabin into which, with the break of day Ringwood descended, was, according to invariable custom, situate in the extreme after 2 part of the vessel, so as to enjoy to the utmost the advantage afforded by the stern lights for cheerfulness and ventilation. In its other arrangements, however, it differed not a little from the similar apartments in ships of war of that, or indeed any other day. All the guns, which were carried by the low light picaroon, were on her upper deck; which, somewhat in advance of the marine architecture of the times, was perfectly flush from stem to stern—by this arrangement the whole interior of the vessel was reserved, free from the incumbrance of the batteries, for the accommodation of the numerous crew, and for the needful stores of food and war munitions, and as its sub-divisions were not, as has been said above, conformable to ordinary practice, it will not be superfluous to give a brief description of their fashion and appliances. In the first place, then, be it observed, that the cabin companion, instead of being situate abaft the mizen, was placed about half way betwixt that spar and the mainmast—the stairway which it contained opening into a narrow space, between two musket-proof bulkheads, perforated with loopholes and crenelles for shot of arquebuse or carbine. In the forward of these partitions, which ran entirely across the vessel, there was no aperture whatever, except the shot-holes above mentioned—in the centre of the other, however, was a low steel-clenched door-way, before which a sentinel stood on duty with his firelock loaded night and day; while a second, similarly armed, kept guard on deck by the companion hatch. This portal, framed like the bulkheads, of timber so thick as to be musket proof, gave entrance to a narrow passage, running fore and aft, between the armorer's and gunner's store rooms, and through another strong door to the ward-room or apartment of the officers, under which general term were included all the classes superior to the private marines, with no distinction as to warrant or commission. This was a large, low space, occupying the whole width, and about twenty feet of the length of the vessel, fitted with a long table in the centre, above which there swung from the ceiling a compass, and several lamps. The sides were occupied by berths sufficiently commodious; while a range of lockers, covered with cushions of rich velvet, so as to wear the semblance of a superb divan, ran round the whole apartment. The light was admitted, not, as is usual, through a skylight, but by a range of small glazed apertures pierced through the sides like port-holes, and like them provided with massive shutters, which might be battened down in rough and stormy weather, or in time of action. When it is added to this, that the deck which formed the floor was covered by a splendid carpet from the Turkish loom—that the curtains of the berths were of the richest arras tapestry—that two large beaufets of some costly Indian wood were decked with gorgeous plate, flagons, and goblets, covers, and cups, and tankards, of gold and silver, carved and embossed with the best art of Italy's best sculptors—and that, in wondrous contrast to the luxurious decoration of the room, offensive weapons of every shape and every construction, were disposed ready to meet the hand, wherever any vacant space was left for their arrangement—a very fair idea may be formed of the wild blending there displayed of almost regal pomp with warlike preparation. Thus round the mainmast was suspended, in a fair gilded rack, a stand of partisans with shafts of ebony, and blades, two feet in length, of brightly polished steel. Upon the bulkheads, at each end of the apartment, pistols and carbines, loaded and primed, and ready for immediate service, and Turkish yatagans, Damascus cimiters, blades of Bilboa and Toledo, with Malay creases, Scottish dirks, and poniards of Italian fabric, all glittering with golden chasings and bright gems, were placed in fantastical devices, of stars, and suns, and crescents, reflecting every beam of light, and almost rivalling in splendor the luminaries in whose forms they had been modelled. Besides this common stock, to every column parting the sleeping berths, was attached a complete panoply—with fascinet, cuirass, and buckler, pistols and boarding axe, and broadsword of the most choice material and construction. It was apparent at a glance, that this, the quarter of the officers, must also be regarded as the stronghold, the citadel as it were, of the ship. It might perhaps be conjectured likewise, from the arrangements, that the occupants of this magnificent apartment were not entirely free from some touch of jealousy, if not apprehension, as regarded the good faith of their subordinates. The upper bulkhead, parting the captain's cabin from the ward-room of his officers, was, like the lower one, ball proof, and looped for musketry— the door-way, as before, gave access to a narrow vestibule or passage, arranged in this case as the Rover's private armory, and communicating by a hatch in the floor with the ship's magazine and larger arm-room. From the ceiling of this vestibule, which was not more than a yard in width, was slung a lamp of silver with two burners; beneath the clear broad glare of which a negro, of gigantic stature, and features singularly handsome for his race, stalked to and fro with shouldered carbine, and a whole armory of knives and pistols in the broad belt that girded his white linen caftan about his thin and sinewy flanks. Another African, who both for bulk and comeliness, might well have been twin-brother to the sentinel, lay buried in deep sleep upon a velvet-covered pallet, which occupied the whole space to the left hand of the door-way, with all his weapons round him. And never by day or by night did those two grim life-guardsmen leave their appointed post together —and singly but at rare and distant intervals—one sleeping while the other watched— one feasting while the other fasted—but both continually at hand, and ready on the slightest signal to do their chieftain's bidding, whether for good or evil. On entering the last door-way, a scene of singular beauty was presented to the eye of the spectator. The cabin was perhaps twenty feet in width, by half that depth, except that in the centre a recess of about ten feet square was formed by the projection of two state rooms, one on each hand, into the chamber—this alcove, raised one step higher than the cabin floor, was lighted by two of the stern windows occupying its whole breath, and reaching almost from the ceiling to the deck—the other two lights being cut off by the state-rooms above mentioned. The alcove was carpeted with a thick soft Persian rug, and hung with seagreen velvet, fringed with broad arabesques of gold; a divan covered with the same stuff ran round it, while the centre was occupied by a circular table of dark wood inlaid with ivory and brass. Against the state-room partitions there hung, on the one side, a set of shelves filled with about a hundred books in costly bindings; and on the other, a portrait of a young girl seemingly not over seventeen years old—a master-piece of the world's master painter, Antonio Vandyk—with a long two-edged gold-hilted broadsword, and a brace of large horseman's pistols, of workmanship to match the rapier, fixed to the panel under it, as if to guard the lovely treasure. Upon the circular table there stood a crucifix of gold, and a small vase of the same precious metal, containing some choice flowers of that tropical clime, while near them lay an open volume of Italian poetry, a Spanish gittern, and some manuscript music, partially covered by an embroidered kerchief of white silk and gold. The larger and lower portion of the cabin was carpeted and decked with hangings of the same color and material with those in the alcove. A large square table filled the centre, on which lay maps and charts, with books and instruments of navigation. An antique cabinet of oak, with massive ornaments of brass, a beaufet covered with vessels of wrought gold and goblets of rock crystal, another bookcase, with perhaps two hundred volumes, and several huge arm-chairs of oak, with velvet cushions, completed the furniture. It must not, however, be forgotten that here, as in the outer rooms, the walls were further decorated by a superb collection of arms, offensive and defensive, of every age and nation; the most costly and most prominent of which was a complete suit of tilting armor of blue Milan steel, all damascened with gold, such as was worn in the fourteenth century by every knight of name, and by the most unhappy of the Stuarts, and some few of his leaders even so late as the war of the English Revolution. Such was the form and fashion of the cabin into which, his long night-watch concluded, Ringwood descended. In the ward-room, as he passed, his second officer—a young and handsome Englishman with a fair skin, where it had not been bronzed by long exposure to a tropical sky, laughing blue eyes, and a profusion of light curly hair— was seated at the table, busily engaged, with several fine looking lads of various ages, from fourteen to twenty, in discussing a morning meal as sumptuous as a ship's store might furnish, with the addition of fresh fish of several kinds, and a tureen of turtle; which, though concocted only by the untaught skill of the bright-skinned and clear mulatto, who waited by the beaufet, resplendent in cap, hose, and jerkin, of unsullied whiteness, was even thus no despicable fare; as was attested by the frequent applications to its dispenser, who seemed to be in no small danger, while ministering to the appetites of others, of losing his own breakfast. At a smaller board, and a little way apart, the armorer and gunner, two thick-set sturdy-looking Britons of the Saxon race, contemning the effeminate luxuries of potted game, broiled fish, and turtle-soup, diluted by champagne and bordeaux, were revelling in what they deemed the manlier enjoyment of toasted cheese, black puddings, and fat ale. With a gay smile and some light jest, the Rover declined the invitation of his officers to join them at their festive board; and bowing with an air of easy dignity passed onward, showing no haste or agitation in his measured tread, and closing the door gently after him, as he entered the small vestibule which led to his own cabin. “You might as well have spared yourself the trouble of that invitation, good master Falconer,” said one of the juniors, who filled the place of midshipman in a more regular service—“a likely thing it were that he should tarry here, for such a poor temptation as meat and drink may offer, with such a feast of charms wooing him yonder. By St. George, well might the loveliness of that pale, black-browed beauty overcome the virtue of an anchorite!” “Hold hard, there, Anson”—cried another—“covet not thou, that which is sacred to thy betters.” “Tush, man—tush!” answered the first speaker, “I covet her not, by St. George; I love not your delicate, coy damsels—better one Ariadne fresh from the arms of the blithe wine god, than twenty tearful Niobes. We shall have, by-and-by, a goodly chorus of shrieks, yells, and lamentations, I doubt not, to tell us how he prospers in his wooings.” But though a general burst of merriment hailed this prophetic speech, and although every ear was for a time on the alert to catch some indication of the progress of events between the Rover and his lovely captive, not a sound reached them, that afforded any clue to their excited curiosity. Closing the door, as has been said, gently behind him as he left the wardroom, the Rover turned the key, and dropped a massive bar further to guard against intruders. “Let none disturb me, Pluto,” he said to the sentinel, “on any pretext whatever—I am o'erdone with watching, and shall betake me to my cot till noon. And hark thee, sirrah; whatever thou mayst hear within, HEAR IT NOT, if thou wouldst have ears afterward, to hear withal!—Hear nothing thou, unless I call on thee—nor thy twin devil yonder, either!” The sable functionary grinned, till he showed his ivory teeth almost from ear to ear, as Ringwood tutored him; and, when he had done speaking, laid his broad hand upon his chest, and bowed in silent acquiescence to his master's will. Satisfied, apparently, that his attendants comprehended and would implicitly obey his bidding, the captain paused no longer, but entered his apartment without further waste of words, with every sinew of his body strung, and every energy of his strong mind resolved upon his savage purpose. No clothing had been given to the hapless prisoners, beyond the miserable relics of their torn garments, which had been spared in the first moment of their capture; nor indeed, save for the wants of delicacy, was any more required; for the weather was extremely hot and sultry, and the air of the small cabin, though all the windows were thrown open to catch the favoring breeze, was confined and oppressive. Little, therefore, had it been in the power of those wretched girls to do in aid of their offended modesty— little, however, as it was, all, that the utmost delicacy with their small means could have effected, was performed. Teresa's hair had been replaced, folded in massive wreaths about her classic temples, decently ordered, but devoid of the most simple ornament. Her single robe, of thin and half transparent linen, had been arranged; and the huge rent, which had displayed all the voluptuous charms of her young bosom and round ivory shoulders, repaired by such devices as woman can alone contrive; so that the beauties of her unrivalled form, though not concealed—for how could one light fold of cambric conceal the swelling outlines, the luxuriant roundness, the unmatched symmetry of that shape, delicately full, yet slight withal and sylphlike?—were veiled at least from the too bold intrusion of an unchaste eye. The stains, however, were still there—the frightful stains of recent massacre— the plain print of ensanguined fingers upon the sullied surface of that virgin robe—and her small and slender ankles, which might not be concealed beneath her scanty draperies, were still encrusted thickly with the unnatural taint of human slaughter. With the dark fringe of her long downcast lashes drawn in distinct relief against a cheek as colorless and cold as monumental marble— without one ray of hope, one gleam of intellect, to lighten up the dull and soulless gloom which brooded over those glorious features, like a grey storm-cloud overshadowing a lovely landscape—her brow, too much oppressed to feel the agony of its own inward aching, propped on one snowy hand; while with the azure veins painted in fearful vividness upon its deadly whiteness, the other hung down by her side, motionless, lifeless, and unconscious —with scarce more sense of sorrow or of pain than Niobe, when the last shaft had flown and her last child lay dead before that stony effigy which had but a moment since writhed with the anguish of a mother's grief—silent, and cold, and rigid, save when a quick convulsive shiver, the only sign of life she had displayed for hours, ran through her palsied form shaking it for an instant, and then leaving it still as the grave and nearly as insensible—tearless, and mute in her exceeding agony, Teresa sat erect in a huge oaken chair placed almost in the centre of the cabin; with the black girl, her sole attendant, lately her slave, but now at least her equal—for in their common misery all past distinctions were abolished—crouching on the rich carpet at her feet, and clinging to the knees of her, in whom, so deep set was her half-idolatrous veneration, she could not but imagine some power must still reside, some magic of authority that must compel respect even from the world's outcast—the proud, pitiless corsair. Such was the picture that met Ringwood's eye as his foot crossed the threshold—a picture that might well have called up sentiments of pity from the most iron bosom! But in the breast of the wild Rover pity, which spite his merciless trade oft found a dwelling there, was for the time overpowered; crushed as it were, and silenced by the vast flood of fierce and fiery passions, which swept across his soul, withering up and searing every kind sentiment, as the hot lava scathes the innocent flowers, when he beheld the child—the heart, as it were, the more than heart—of his detested foe, helpless, and courting, as it seemed, the blow that should heap tenfold ruin on the object of his undying hatred. The voice of memory spoke trumpet-tongued within him—memory, fresh from other days and distant climes!—memory, busy with confidence unwillingly bestowed, and brutally requited!—memory, full of wrongs, and woes, and agony, and degradation! The voice of memory spoke within him; spoke with a thousand thunderous voices, whose every whisper was of vengeance!—vengeance, delayed for long, long years, but never for one hour forgotten!—vengeance, which should exceed a thousand fold the injury that woke it!—vengeance, with which the universe should ring, and which the page of history should hand down, as unrivalled, to the appalled and shuddering ears of countless generations! With such a prompter at his heart's core, how should he pause to think of Ruth or of forgiveness! He paused not!—an exulting smile curled his lip!—curled it with an expression of pride, malice, scorn, and triumph, that no word but FIENDISH could convey, however faintly, to the mind!—his breast swelled with an ecstasy almost convulsive; his eye positively lightened with excitement—the terrible excitement of ungovernable passions, o'er-mastering every obstacle—fierce, furious excitement! ripe with the concentrated fire of every evil, every unholy impulse implanted by the hand of nature in the breast of man, bursting the bonds of reason, wild, remorseless, and untamable. One glance he cast towards the miserable pair, and cheering himself as if by a sudden impulse— “Without there”—he cried—“Ho! without!” On the instant the door was opened, and the black woolly head of the gigantic negro was thrust into the cabin. At the first sound, however, of the Rover's voice, the Spanish lady, whose senses, overpowered by the dull torpor of despair, had not informed her of his entrance, started upon her feet, turning her clear cold gaze full on the splendid person of the pirate chief; while down to her knees clung the black maiden, with the whites of her eyes dilated into glassy circles by the intensity of her dismay. “Take hence the slave girl—bestow her in the hatch beside the greater arm room; keep her close prisoner—but, as you love your life, do her no wrong—not by a word, or look, if you would 'scape my vengeance!—gently— away with her!” A fearful spasm crossed the pale features of Teresa, as the huge black drew nigh; and it seemed as though her terrors would have found vent in a piercing scream, but by a mighty effort she restrained herself. “Let go my robe, Cassandra,” she said at length, in tones which, though they faltered, no terrors could deprive of their almost unearthly sweetness—“Let go my robe, girl—seest thou not that no present harm is meant thee?— and if there were it would boot naught to struggle? Let go—I say! minion, unloose thy grasp”—she cried with increased agitation, as the pirate's minister drew nearer—“wouldst have thy mistress's person polluted by the touch of you foul villain?—nay! tremble not, thou silly one”—she added, kindly, as the terrified creature, relaxing the firm clasp which she had fastened on her lady's dress, fell prostrate and almost insensible before her feet— “they can but kill us—the longest torments— the direst crnelties—can only lead to that—can only inflict DEATH!” As she spoke, gaining courage herself from the effort she made to cheer her fellow-sufferer's spirits, Pluto had raised the half-inanimate and shuddering girl in his strong arms, and was already bearing her towards the vestibule; when by a sudden jerk she almost extricated herself from his embrace, and followed up the first attempt by a succession of fierce rapid struggles and contortions, panting and sobbing till it seemed that her heart would have burst from her bosom, glaring with her disturbed eyes, and foaming at the mouth like a demoniac—till finding all her efforts fruitless, exhausted even more by the violence of her feelings, than by her terrible though vain exertions, she sank into a deep swoon; and with her head hanging upon the massive shoulder of the negro, and all her shapely limbs collapsed and nerveless, was carried off insensible and unresisting. Alone in that luxurious cabin, surrounded with all that is most beautiful to the eye, alone the Spanish maiden stood in the presence—in the power of the merciless Rover. Both young —both beautiful—but oh! how different in their beauty! She, pale and woe-begone, and cold as the white marble which alone could vie with the pure splendor of her skin—hopeless, yet firm—wretched, yet tearless in her misery! He, flushed with fiery passions, burning with high hot hopes, instinct with all the ardent energies, the quenchless vigor, the indomitable power of animal existence! She, the very image and ideal of perfect and most lovely death! He, the unequalled type of glorious and majestic life! With a slow step, as if half doubtful of his purpose, the Rover neared his captive—still she stood firm and motionless, with her large bright eyes shining out, intensely black and lustrous, from her fixed and hueless features—fixed upon his with a cold, steady, and unblenching gaze, like that by which the leech is said to awe his maniac patient, or man, the monarch of creation, to quell the fiercest savage of the wild. It seemed as if that frail and slender girl had listened and believed the tale, “that a lion will turn and flee from a maid in the pride of her purity,” and had resolved to try the virtue of the spell, but on a fiercer and more tameless being. And in good truth for a second's space it showed as though the charm were not all powerless—the haughtyspirit did—did for a moment quail before that firm and fearless gaze!—the strong brave man did hesitate, before the timorous weak maiden! There is in truth nothing so difficult as to approach, with hostile purpose, one who opposes calm and passive fortitude to threatened violence—one who shows naught of fear, meditates nothing of resistance—who neither courts nor shuns the peril. Man will hew down the trembling fugitive, from the same natural impulse which prompts the dog to tear whatever flies from him—he will assault with all the pride of defied valor and insulted strength the strong one who resists him—but he will rarely—rarely nerve himself to the attack of one who fears not nor defies the outrage. At length, with a half start—a start at his own unwonted hesitation—he advanced, and laid his hand upon her shoulder, while she still, moving not, nor speaking, maintained that steadfast gaze, as if she would peruse his soul; nor did the slightest change in her deportment give any token that she had felt his lawless touch, save that a bright flush darted over brow, face, and bosom, brilliant as the electric flash, and scarce less rapid in its passage. “This is well, fair one,” he said with a strange sneer, curling his chiselled lip—“this is well. I had looked for tears and outcries!— but you are wise, my beauty; wiser in your generation, as the scripture hath it, than the children of light!—but why so mute, Teresa? —speak, girl, know you the fortune that awaits you?” and he shook her gently as he spoke, as if to force an answer. “The lamb in the wolf's lair,” replied the maiden, “requires no prophet to foretell her doom.” “You know it, then?—'fore God I had not looked for such most sweet compliance!—you know it, then, and deem it perchance a rare fortune. I knew erewhile you Spanish dames were gamesome, and something light of love; but I deemed not—the more fool I to fancy woman could be at all, and not be wanton— but I deemed not a Spanish damsel of thy blood and lineage should know herself, and knowing rest content to be the paramour of a robber—murderer—pirate!” “Nor do you know it now,” replied she, by a violent effort maintaining that composure which she deemed the most likely to procure forbearance—“nor do you know it now—ten thousand deaths would I die sooner—nor will I be the thing thou sayest!” “How wilt thou help it, sweet one?” he asked sneeringly. “By not consenting—and by dying!—force me you may to your vile will by bratal and unmanly violence—bow me you may, for the brief space that is permitted you, to your dire passions—but wrong is not dishonor, nor outrage disgrace! But for a little time—a little time can you torment me—the Lord hath given you the power, and you must use it as you list —but only for a time.” “Believe it not,” he answered; not unimpressed by the cool majesty of her demeanor— “Believe it not, my power upon you is for ever—for ever at least here on earth? That which I make thee, wilt thou remain till death deliver thee—hearest thou, girl? I say, till death?” “And I reply, not long!” “To die, thou wouldst say, aye! to die by the sudden sword-stroke is not difficult, nor long, nor painful, worth the counting! Nor is the poison cup, though slower and more torturing, too tedious or too difficult for high and resolved spirits—and such I do believe is thine, Teresa. Nor in good truth, as thou didst say but now, are the most cruel, most protracted means by which the flesh can be compelled to quiver through a living death—too much to be endured—to be endured so long as they may last. But mark me, mark me, maiden: to die is not so easy! an eye shall be on you for ever —no means vouchsafed while thy fit lasts— and trust me use will reconcile thee to that life, which thou deemest it no dishonor to enter on compulsion—to die is not so easy!” “Nothing is more so,” she replied, forcing herself to go through the task she had imposed upon her energies. “Nothing is more so. The strongest frame may not endure a fortnight without sustenance—and neither thou, with all thy boasted might, nor all thy mailed myrmidons, can force one feeble girl to swallow one small mouthful, save at her own good pleasure!” “Brave words!” he answered, still with a sneer—“Brave words, Teresa! but behold! here on the walls around you hang fifty sheathless poniards, fifty well-loaded pistols!— had the one feeble girl been so resolved on death, she might have died these three hours gone, and none the wiser! Tush, girl, thou cheatest me not so!” “Hear me,” she said, with an imploring gesture, drawing herself a little back from him —“Here me at least, as thou dost hope for mercy—as thou dost trust in God!” “I do not hope for mercy—I do not trust in God!” he answered. “Why should I? Mercy was not for me or mine, when I implored it on my knees with adjurations, unto which thy feeble prayers are but as whispers to the sovereign thunder! God heard not me when I called on him at my most extreme need. Why should I, girl—why should I? I do not hope for mercy—I do not trust in God, yet will I hear thee—hear thee, for that thou art a woman!” “Hear me then, and believe my words— nor think that I feel not, because I shudder not—that I dread not, loathe not the infamy, because I make my loathings subject to my will, and speak of that most coolly which I will not endure and live. When I first entered here, the thought did cross my soul that freedom was at hand—the blade was bared to win it—but suicide is deadly sin—or if not deadly, allowable but in extremity. There was a hope! one lingering, last hope then—nor hath it quite flown now!—a hope that one so strong, so mighty, and so brave as thou, wouldst shame to harm a woman!—a woman whom all men are bound to shelter and defend for that same weakness which makes it easy— makes it most base and sordid to assail their frailty. Till this one hope is gone, I dare not rush unbidden on eternity. I have thought much—thought coolly on this matter!—the more, and the more coolly I have thought, the more I am resolved, and the more certain mayest thou be that my resolve is changeless. Injure me, and I die! For some brief days thou mayest—thou mayest riot, if such be thy savage will, in the possession, the unmanly forceful brute possession of frail resisting innocence—for some brief days of agony to me— of infamy to thee and of remorse hereafter! With these brief days—thanks to the mighty Maker, who made the subtle and immortal soul so separable from the gross mortal body! —with those brief days thy power for good or ill—and mine for agonized endurance, are at an end for ever! Cries, tears, and lamentations I know vain—therefore I use them not! —but deem not thou shalt win one favor of my weakness, till that by utmost force and violence you have overpowered my most true resistance!” “One word—one whisper from my lips— and thou wouldst fly as eagerly to my embrace, Teresa, as now thou shunnest it,” he again answered, with the same sneer upon his lip— and she observed that his voice sounded calmly, and no longer with the hoarse broken intonation of overwhelming passions; and that the flush which had lighted up his features with a light so unnatural and appalling, had given place to the wonted tints of his complexion. “Not though that word would raise me into paradise—that whisper plunge thee to the abyss of hell!” “What if I were to yield thee to the license of my crew—to the lewd pleasure of yon loathsome blackamoor!” “'Tis sin—vice—degradation—that is loathsome! naught else—naught else. Compelled to my dishonor, I may writhe hopelessly in anguish—I may die here on earth, and dying live for ever in light and bliss, and glory everlasting! Complying I should loathe my very self—should die each day I lived! and perish, body and soul—perish now, and for ever! But thou wilt not—thou canst not—thou art a man—a feeling, a fiery, passionate, and it may be a vicious—yet a MAN! Born of a woman, cradled upon a woman's bosom, nursed from a breast! thou hast grown fair, and strong, and noble, reared by the ministerings of a woman's love! thou didst learn from a woman's tongue the very accents which give voice to thy fell threatenings against a woman's peace! thou hast—thou must have loved, have sighed for, striven for, done gallant deeds to win a woman! and wilt thou—wilt thou now? wilt thou? no! no! thou wilt not—canst not wrong one so weak in her frailty—so strong in her virtue—in her resolve as I! no! no! thine eye is mild, and thy lip quivers—and—and—and —thou wilt—wilt spare, protect—oh God! oh God—thou wilt not wrong me,” and as she spoke, she flung herself down at his feet; clasped his knees tight, tight as the serpent's coil, with her entwining arms; and turning up her pale wan face, with those dark glorious eyes swimming, yet overflowing not in outworn nature's agony, towards the stern, observant, but no longer fierce or inflamed visage of the Rover—“thou wilt not—for thy mother's soul! for the sweet memory of her whom you first loved! thou wilt not wrong me!” “Not now! not now, at least, Teresa! But I have heard thee—hear thou now me. I have a tale to tell thee—of one as innocent— as beautiful as thou, who prayed, as thou hast prayed, for pity—who found it not, and died! This thou must hear—and then thyself shalt say, if it can be that I—I, the Rover—the world's scorn and hate and terror—I, Reginald Ringwood, can pity, much more spare Teresa de Aviles.” CHAPTER V. THE ROVER'S TALE. “I was born of an ancient family in the north of England—of blood as pure and noble as flows in the proudest veins of your Spain's proudest nobles. My Saxon forefathers possessed the broad demesne, beneath whose old oaks I grew up—as firm as they of heart, and scarce less strong of limb—centuries ere the Norman had drenched our isle in gore. I know not, and I care not, how—though they battled to the last for freedom—they held their landships and lordships until, by time and intermarriage, the names of Saxon and Norman were forgotten; and from the mixture of those hostile bloods arose the strongest, bravest, wisest race of men that tread the surface of God's earth. I know not, I care not! I only know, that to me those broad lands descended through a long race of honored ancestors. I only care that I was born, and bred, and shall not die—an English gentleman. “I had a father, noble, and generous, and good—a mother—who was indeed a mother, and who is a saint in heaven!—a sister!—oh! such—such a sister—ay! thou art fair, Teresa —wondrously, exquisitely beautiful—but she was as far before thee, as is the glorious sun before a farthing rush-light! She was—but I can not—can not describe her. No! not to my own void and aching heart, that never hath been filled since—never even for a moment! She was the comrade of my childish joys, the soother of my boyish griefs—the dear repository of my every hope or fear—the bright encourager to all things high and noble—the true unflinching friend—the only one! A few years younger than myself, she grew up to bright, glorious womanhood under the kindred shelter of my stronger youth—she was my all in all—oh God! how I adored her. “But I must on—while I was yet almost a boy, the secret heart-burnings, the disaffections and dissensions, which had so long been smouldering darkly between the king and parliament, blazed out into rebellion and fierce civil war. Both parties flew to arms—the nobles and the gentry of the land, with many of their yeomanry and tenants, drew their swords for the king;—the citizens and burghers, and not a few of the smaller landholders, espoused the cause of parliament. “Throughout the north, the gentry, many of whom were Catholics, were loyal to a man —and with the Vavasours and Musgraves, the Landales and the Wentworths, my father buckled on his arms to fight beneath the standard of his king—and well he fought for it, from its first ominous erection at Worcester amid storm and tempest, till it fell never more to rise upon the fatal moor of Marston; where he too fell beside it, undauntedly but vainly striving against the iron-clad invincibles of Cromwell! Boy as I was, through all those bloody fields, I fought beside my father's bridle. Boy as I was, at Brentford I was thanked by Charles himself before the leaders of the army—boy as I was, when my bold father perished in his stirrups, I slewthe man who smote him down, and drew off his retreating troop, sorely diminished, but unbroken. It is a long tale, but suffice it, that Lilburn a few days afterwards stormed, sacked, and utterly destroyed the dwelling of my fathers—that, overdone with weariness and woe and watching, my mother wasted away, like snow before the April sunshine, and died at length of that worst malady, a pined and broken heart. Then, our lands became the heritage of others —apportioned by the victor Independents to the least scrupulous and bravest of their creatures;—then was our very name—a name coeval in proud fame with England's story—pro scribed and outlawed. As best I might, I cared for my loved sister's safety. In the mean dwelling of an ancient servant of our race, an humble fisherman upon the western coast, in lowly guise and under a feigned name, for years she was concealed in safety— while I, rash, desperate, and daring, fought fetlock-deep in blood wherever banner waved, or trump was blown in England—now in the ranks of some united host, and under some renowned and regular leader—now leading my own little troop of undismayed adventurers through the wild pleasures and yet wilder strifes of that guerilla warfare—the fiercest and most feared of the king's partisan commanders. Enough is told, when I have said that not a single plot was planned, a single insurrection fostered, but my head was busy with its machinations. That I fought on with Lucas, Lisle, and Goring, till every hope was lost—that in the siege of that loyal city Colchester, I shed my blood in its defence till all was over; and owed my safety then to wounds which fettered me to my sick bed, and to the unbribed faith of a poor laundress, who concealed me from the hand of my inveterate pursuers. After long months of suffering and of precarious hiding, I reached at length the cottage, where, without now one hope of seeing me again on earth, my sister lingered on in sad but patient sorrow; looking for death alone to liberate her from the woes which weighed her down to the brink, as it were, of that wished-for grave, which, seeming to yawn ever to receive her, opened not to her prayers. Alas!— alas!—that it did not! Alas! that she died not then, with the young freshness of her innocent beauty, pure as an angel's sigh—spotless as God's own sunshine! But words are vain—sorrow is vain—all! all is vain, save vengeance! “It was deep night when I arrived at that lone cottage—and oh! the ecstasy, the thrilling ecstasy, that quivered through each nerve of my rapt frame as once again I clasped that angel sister to my heart—never again, as fondly I believed and falsely, to be torn thence, while both had being! Little time was there then for joy or sweet affection—little enough for needful preparation, and swift flight! The moon had risen before I reached the cottage— before she set, the lugger was afloat, manned by stout hands and trusty hearts; her every sail distended by an auspicious breeze; bearing us, bearing us for ever, from nature's sweetest names—our home, our country! Long centuries before, my father's race had intermarried with a high family of Spain—and, although time had loosened the essential tie of blood, friendly connexion had been maintained ever; and still, in name and courtesy at least if not in very deed, the haughty family of English Ringwoods were cousins to the proud Spanish clan, whose head is—the Melendez de Aviles! “Start not, Teresa! By the God who looks upon us now—who looked of yore on that most hellish crime—who shall anon look on that crime's meet retribution. By the God —I say—the God of both our fathers! the blood of thy race runs even now, hot as the lava of Vesuvius, through every artery and vein of this my body! my body that has lived through agonies and toils and perils, which might have consumed nerves of brass and thews of tempered steel, which would have worn out mine, but for the treasured oath of vengeance that upheld me! “But passion boots not. What is done, is done!—what shall be, shall be! Friendly connexion had, I said, been maintained ever! Letters had passed from age to age, presents been interchanged, and mutual benefits done and requited. When our Black Prince displayed his Lion banner in aid of your King Pedro, my ancestor was rescued from the wrath of that brave bastard, Henry de Transtamara, by the Melendez of that day. When Spain's armada was dispersed, scattered to the four winds of heaven, by Frobisher and Drake and Hawkins, it was a Ringwood that redeemed the chieftain of the Des Aviles; and sent him home cumbered with gifts and ransom, free from the dark tower of London. Allied in blood, allied by mutual courtesies, my father —when first war broke out—remitted treasures, plate, gold, and store of jewels, to the faith of his Spanish kinsman. Provident and prepared for either fortune, he looked to Spain as an asylum, should the king's cause be bucklered by bold hearts in vain. When my good father fell—letters—fair letters full of greeting—full of high courtesy and noble promise—styling me `Dear and trusty cousin, praying me `of my love to deem his purse as mine—his palace as my castle,' were borne to me—fair seeming! false! false letters! signed `Juan de Melendez de Aviles.' Full of all honorable confidence, full of gratitude and love, now that even hope was lost in England, I set sail; freely as to a second country, for the bright shores of Spain! as to a second home, for the proud halls of De Aviles! Three days' fair sail, we made the Spanish coast! another week, and in Madrid we were received, received not as exiles and outlaws, but as most honored friends, most esteemed kinsmen, by that same Juan de Melendez—that same vile, heartless, soulless thing, which thou callest father. Aye! I recall it! all—all—everything! The very palace gates, upon the porphyry steps of which the smooth-faced fiend received us—the very liveried menials, who cringed so humbly to our bidding, the very smile, the very gesture, yea more, the very garb, with every small detail of plume, and scarf, and jewelled rapier, which he wore—all gleam upon mine unforgetting eyes distinct and palpable, as though they were depicted to my outward sense by some rare limner's skill. He was a noble gallant to the eye; witty, accomplished, beautiful, and brave—nor, as I fondly deemed, more fair than faithful. Every art, every gentle knowledge, every superb accomplishment were centred in his mind, his manner. To the eye nothing—nothing of God's creation here on earth could be more glorious, more transcendantly surpassing man's estate, more god-like! In heart, no thing on earth, no thing in the abyss of hell could be more utterly corrupt, more base, more superhumanly depraved and bad, more fiendish! Yet years passed ere I gained this knowledge, years passed, and I believed him—nor was I even then unwise in this world's wisdom—all that was kind, and good, and noble. What wonder that one younger than myself, artless and unsuspecting, judging of others' faith by her guileless standard, full of sweet fervent gratitude, betrayed into security by her own very purity of soul, and by the sanction of a brother's presence, should have believed as I! and loved! and—and—oh God! that I must speak it—fallen! fallen! the victim to a perjury so hellishly devised, so deep, so fathomless, that wisest wisdom would have been all at fault to sound it! The growing love of my sweet sister, the constant and devoted wooing of the enamored Juan I saw, and was well pleased to see it. For—when I saw the liking mutual; when I knew that my Teresa in purity of an unstained descent was a match meet for kings; that in the rescued treasures of my father's house she had a fitting dowry; that in all else —beauty of form and face, intellect, feeling, soul—she would have been a prize for the choice of angels; when I beheld and knew all this, I had no whisper of false pride to bid me interpose between their inclinations and their union! I had no doubts, no fears, no hesitations! Juan, too, had a sister—a fair, bright, artless being, of whom, if I did not entirely love her, I had at least mused fervently and deeply. Thoughts of a double link had crossed my mind, as no impossible solution to the Gordian knot of our entangled fortunes, not as a termination to be gained by rash or sudden speed, but as an end, which, other things agreeing, might in due time crown all our cares with pure and peaceful happiness. Thus days and months rolled on, calm, undisturbed, and happy. At times indeed, a touch of wonder would come over me, why—when their mutual feelings were so evident; when my approval might have been known even from my silence; when everything was suitable, and no cloud even on the remote horizon threatened a storm which could divide them—why they should so prolong their courtship—so needlessly delay the consummation of their bliss. Still, as they seemed to understand each other, I deemed it equally indelicate and unwise, that I without the shadow of a pretext should interfere between them. Entirely unsuspicious, therefore, and fearless even of the possibility of wrong, I left things to their natural course. “Meanwhile an opportunity at length occurred for my advancement, my establishment in a befitting rank, and active service; an expedition was in course of preparation under the prince, Don John, for the Low Countries, there to co-operate with the great Condé, against the allied force of the Cromwellians under Lockhart, and the French Mazarinists under the great Turenne, which had already reduced Gravelines, and Merrdyke, and were now threatening Dunkirk. In this fair expedition I was appointed to take part; and in no humbler station than lieutenant-general of the cavalry. This proud appointment was obtained for me by the solicitations of Melendez, for which—Heaven's hottest curses blight him!—I deemed him worthy of my eternal gratitude. Brief space was granted for my preparation—yet, ere I started on my honorable duty, I opened my heart freely both to Melendez and Teresa; and it was settled that, the campaign ended, they at least should be made man and wife; while Juan plighted me his word that, should I prosper in my wooing with his sister, his every aid should be forthcoming. With a light heart I started; all careless at the present, all confident of the bright future. In a short time we reached the Netherlands, and there my every faculty of mind or body was engrossed by my military duties. It is not now my purpose, for it avails us nothing, to spin out long details concerning that disastrous and disgraceful campaign, wherein we were out-witted, out-manœuvred, and outfought. First came the defeat of Sandhills, whereat the English standard waved on both sides, and victory was once again decided by the stout fanatics of the republic! then Dunkirk instantly surrendered! then step by step were we beat back, town after town admitting our victorious foes! Enough, that at the Sandhills I was dismounted in the last charge of the superior cavalry of Castelman, which broke us like a thunder shock! My right arm shattered by a pistol shot, my helmet cloven, and my skull laid bare by a long broadsword-cut, a pike wound through the broken taslet of my left thigh—twice was I galloped over by the contending troopers in close melée, and left for dead upon the field. Rescued by the attachment of a veteran follower from the tender mercies of the plunderers, I lay for weeks insensible, and for weeks more in helpless agony till the campaign was ended by the truce; and weak of frame, bent and bowed by my half healed wounds, I slowly journeyed homeward. Something I was indeed discouraged, and something grieved, that during my long illness, during my slow recovery, no letters should have reached me whether from Juan or my sister; yet even this might be explained by the distracted state of the whole country; France torn at the same time by civil strifes and foreign warfare; the Netherlands divided into factions, filled with fierce bands of foreign soldiery; all business at an end, and all communications interrupted. Consoling myself with such thoughts as these, for the neglect of my Spanish friends, I journeyed, with all the speed my frail health would allow, towards Madrid. I reached that splendid city; hurried through its deserted streets, for it was midnight when I arrived, to the proud dwelling of Melendez. The porter who replied to my loud summons, after a pause strangely at variance with the former promptness of attendance which characterized all my friend's retainers—knew me not at the first; so strangely was I altered by the enfeebling nature of my wounds, and by the great exhaustion consequent on my journeying with those wounds yet unhealed—nor when he recognised me, did he seem wholly unembarrassed by my appearance. The family, he told me—Don Juan, and the Lady Isidore, and the English Senora—had removed from the city several months before; and were now dwelling on a magnificent estate, of which I had heard Melendez speak with rapture, situate on the lower ridges of the southeastern Pyrenees. Worn out with fatigue, I resolved to give myself a single day's repose; in the course of which I learned from the porter, that shortly after the removal of the family from town, tidings had come that I had been slain at the Sandhills; and that no subsequent news had arrived concerning me, so that on all hands I was believed dead; to which he cunningly attributed his consternation at my unexpected re-appearance; he also mentioned, as a casual report, that it had come to his ears that my sister had been married to the Conde de Aviles, shortly before the tidings of my death in battle. The following morning, so much of fever had anxiety and toil produced, that I was miserably ill, and utterly unable to rise from my couch, much more to undertake a tedious journey. I wrote, however, on the instant, both to my sister and Don Juan; telling them all that had befallen me, mentioning the reports which had encountered me on my arrival, promising to make all due speed to join them, and praying them to write me instantly, as I was all anxiety and agitation. Ten days elapsed before I was enabled to rise, and a week more before I could endure the motion of a horse— yet not a line had come to hand to lighten my curiosity, which was fast growing—why I knew not—into a fixed presentiment of evil. At length I was sufficiently recovered, and on a bright autumnal morning, gallantly mounted and well armed, followed by two stout English veterans. I sallied forth from the portals of Melendez; hurrying with the speed of fear towards the city gates. Before I had reached there, however, I was surrounded and arrested by a band of the holy brotherhood according to a warrant of the all-powerful Inquisition. Four months I languished in its dungeons, often examined, often threatened with the torture, forbidden any intercourse with those without—in short, entombed alive. At length, when I had given up all hope of liberty, I was discharged with no more of explanation than I had received on my capture—what of that? there was no possible redress! I had been denounced to the Holy Inquisition—therefore arrested! The charge had not been made out— therefore I was discharged! and well for me, I ought to be content! yea! thankful! and I was thankful—none but the captive know the exceeding, the transcendant bliss of freedom. I was free! I was strong! for spare food and hard lodging had worked miracles for a restoration of my health—I would seek out my friends—fly to my sister! “I repaired once more to the palace of my friend; when, to my mighty wonder and yet mightier rage, the porter dashed the wicket in my face with a horse laugh, barred it within, and grinning through its barred lattice to my teeth, he bade me `go seek my sister in the Lazar House; meet place for harlotry like hers!' Words cannot express my rage, my madness. All availed nothing—madness, rage, entreaty!—no further answer was returned to me—the wicket opened not—all was contemptuous, scoruful silence. At length, dreading I know not what, I turned me to the Lazar House, and there—there—oh God! there I found her!—there in that den of guilt and misery, dying by inches, worn, and wan, and wasted—there on the sordid pallet vouchsafed by niggard charity, in the last agonies of life, pale as the sheeted snow, and shrunken till each bone of her fair frame seemed struggling through the transparent skin—there found I my sweet sister. She died—happy at least to die upon a friendly bosom—she died in blessing me, and praying, from Eternal mercy, the pardon of her murderer. She died, but not till she had faltered forth the tale of her unprecedented ruin! The sun did not turn pale in heaven—the earth yawned not, nor trembled— nature held on its wonted course—God heard the tale, as he had looked upon the deed—and the fell villain prospered—prospered, and laughed in the exulting pride of conscious strength, and high impunity of wrong! All from the very first had been premeditated—I was appointed to command, merely that I might be removed from the scene of destined outrage; a future period was appointed for the marriage, merely to drown all possible suspicion. Scarce was I gone, before the treachery stirred into action; the first step was to find an expert forger of handwriting; nor was this first want long ungratified; a villain, triple dyed in guilt, a disfrocked monk of Italy, the minister for years of Juan's secret infamies, was pitched upon for the foul deed; and foully he performed it. My letters, regularly intercepted by Melendez, were laid before him, one by one, as they arrived, till he had learned the trick of my handwriting; so that I scarce myself could mark the fraud. This done, the work commenced; letter was forged on letter, to that unhappy girl, urging her to delay no longer the consummation of her nuptials—urging her by a thousand specious pretexts, and at length enjoining it upon her, as the last dying mandate from a brother's death-bed, to be united on the instant to Melendez. So specious was the plot, that mortal wisdom scarcely could have fathomed it. Her letters, like my own, were intercepted—answered!—each argument refuted; each doubt set aside; each apprehension banished! moreover, not my handwriting only, but my whole turn of composition, my character of thought, my style, had been so copied, that as I read the living evidence of the lie, myself, I almost deemed them mine. It is enough, that they prevailed! a marriage, a false marriage, performed by that same villain monk, and witnessed by, her sex's shame, the shameless Isidore, completed the accursed plan. Innocent, innocent she fell! Fell, as an angel might have fallen, and yet remained an angel. Secure of his poor victim, flushed with success and passion, he carried her to his castle in the south; and till satiety had effaced passion, and custom worn away the charms of novelty, had treated her with at least the semblance of affection. Soon, soon was the dream ended! My return from the army struck the last blow to his expiring love—if love that may be called, which was in truth corrupt and brutal lust! The illness which delayed me, he deemed an anspicious chance, and with unexampled, aye! unheard brutality, in the most public manner, in the most coarse revolting language before his grinning menials and sycophantic guests, he told that suffering angel of the fraud—the fraud which had destroyed her! jeered at her tears—yea! bade her convey her beauties to some new lover, and some fresher market! And when she clasped his knees in agonies of tearless supplication, he spurned her—spurned her with his foot, and bade his vassals cast her forth into the wintry midnight. Alone, on foot, in the light garments of the ball-room, without food, or aid, or money, she was cast forth at midnight; doubtless cast forth to perish. But so it was not fated! through storm and snow she struggled on! barefoot! begging her bread! She reached Madrid, and fainting in the street, some charitable hand conveyed her to the wretched dwelling, where suffering, and woe, and utter desolation, soon brought her to the long last home: sole refuge of the wretched. She died! Died, I say, died! but left me living; living alone for vengeance. My tale is ended! it boots not to tell how, when the second Charles regained his father's throne, he yielded by base amnesty the lands of his true followers, to the oppressors who had seized them. A double outlaw, thence, have I lived for vengeance—and though thus far thy father hath escaped me, some have I had already, more shall I have ere long—aye, to satiety!— “Some have I had already!—and that, girl, not a little. The monk I watched for weeks —for months—(thy father, conscience-stricken, had fled his country.) For months had I watched him, till, as he journeyed towards France, through the wild passes of the Pyrenees, I swooped upon him. I dragged him to the loneliest peak of those dread summits— stripped him and bound him to a thunder-splintered tree—it was the very height of summer—placed food and water close before him—so close that he could see! so far that he could not reach it—no, not to save his soul! I left him there to perish—yet watched him from a distance, that none might succor or release him—that I might hear his blasphemies, and mark his agonies, and glut my soul's dear vengeance. He perished—how, you may guess; he perished there, and knew me ere he perished. “Thine aunt—the Lady Isidore—married, as thou knowest well, Teresa, the Conde di Ribiera; and within three months after, was found dead—pierced by three mortal wounds —in her own bridal bed. I slew her!—I, Teresa—I!—I, Ringwood the avenger! scaled the terrace at midnight—entered her room and woke her—woke her to die! One shriek rang through the silent house, rousing its every inmate! I leaped from the balcony, one moment ere the chamber-doors flew open. Have I not been avenged? “Before your father's eyes, your brother died by the torture! “Before your father's eyes, Teresa, you shall be shown ere long!—shown—what hedared to call my sister, and lied in calling her! Start not—be sure of it; for it shall be! This only boon I grant thee—grant to thy courage, girl, and nobleness of heart!—that not now will I wrong thee—nor by violence!—thou shalt consent to thine own degradation! Meanwhile, rest here—that state-room shall be thine; and the black girl, Cassandra, shall be restored to thee; fit garments shall be furnished thee; thou shalt eat at my table. Answer me not, girl!—not a word—it shall be so, I say it shall! “I must on deck, somewhat is moving there, that needs my presence. Content thee, and farewell!” CHAPTER VI. Broadly and brightly dawned the morning, which followed the departure of the buccaneers, upon the forest-girdled wall of St. Augustine. The sun shone blithely, and freshly the sea-breeze blew. The small waves, crisped by the lightsome air, danced glittering in the sunlight; while thousands of white gulls were on the wing, fanning the wavelets with their silver pinions. Jocund and merry was the scene; and heavy must that heart have been, which yielded not to the sweet soothing influences of the time and seasons. Heavy was every heart, and downcast every eye, of those who were abroad on that fair morning. The bells of many a church and convent were ringing, “With a deep sound to and fro— Heavily to the heart they go.” while on the four tall frigates, which now lay moored in shore, under the covering guns of battery and bastion, the colors waved at half-mast in honor to the dead, whose obsequies were even now in process. And now the city gates flew open, and a long train of monks and friars, chanting the mournful miserere, with crosslet and with crosier, censer, and pix, and crucifix swept forth from the wide portals. Then upborne on the stalwart shoulders of four great Spanish captains, whose plumes and sword-knots of pure white betokened the brief years of him they mourned, followed the coffin of the young Melendez! Words cannot paint the agony which overshadowed the bold lineaments, and bowed to earth the manly frame of Juan, following to his last home the last male scion of his immemorial race. Bravely, however, manfully he struggled with his tortures, and subdued them. Steadfastly did he gaze, with a fixed tearless eye, upon the disappearing coffin; as with heart-sickening sound the dull clods of unconsecrated earth—for unanointed he had fallen, unhouseled, and unshriven—rattled upon its hollow lid; one quick spasm shook his every limb—distorted every feature, as the last sod was flattened down over that cherished head, which now perceived, felt, suffered nothing. The soldiers gathered round the grave—flash after flash—roar after roar—the volleyed honors of their musketry burst over the dull ears that heard them not, nor heeded. But with the rattling din the high soul of the father lightened forth from the cloud of grief which had oppressed it—he drew his long bright rapier from its scabbard, stretched it forth slowly above his son's low bed, and then uplifting it, with his eyes glaring upward, flung his left hand abroad; and with distended chest, beut brows, and head erect, stood for a second's space motionless, stern, and silent, though his lips quivered as with inward prayer, sublime and awful in the might of self-controlling energy and pride. Then with a loud clear voice— “Hear!” he exclaimed—“Hear thou! Maker of all things, Judge of all men, hear! I, Juan de Melendez de Aviles, noble of Spain, and knight of Calatrava, swear! hear, on the grave of the last male of the proud name I bear —here, with my foot upon the sod that covers that young head—with my sword in my hand, I swear: never, while life is left me, never, by day nor by night, fasting or feasting, mirthful or in the hour of woe, to cease from plotting, from pursuing, from revenging!—never until this sword is crimson to the hilt with the heart-blood of him who slew thee—thee, innocent and helpless that thou wert, mine own and only one. If ever I unbelt the brand, if ever I withdraw me from the chace, if ever I relent, or spare, or pardon, till that the sword, the faggot, and the gallows have, each and all, been glutted with the lives of thy destroyers— if ever, oh! my son, I forget to avenge thee— may my flesh feed the vulture and the wolf— my soul be yielded to man's everlasting foe!” He paused, and as the sounds of his last accents died away—moved by one common impulse, a dozen of the cavaliers who had accompanied the funeral train, and who bareheaded, but with flashing eyes and inflamed visages, had listened to the father's imprecation, unsheathed at once their swords, and pointing them to heaven, chorused that awful oath by one deep, heartfelt, and unanimous “amen!” “For us—for us, and our sons after us,” they cried, “be thine oath binding!—never to spare, nor pardon, nor relent!—never to cease from hunting to destruction the murderers of thy dead son—the ravishers of thy living daughter—never, so help us God, St. Jago, and our honor!” The mournful ceremonial was concluded; a massive cross of stone was pitched into the sand at that grave's head, marking the spot where he slumbers now so soundly, that hapless but high-hearted boy—the spot, where yesterday he bore so soldierly and well the tortures which had slain him. The military music of the garrison struck up—the very trumpeters, inflamed by the sympathetic indignation which blazed forth so vividly from these untamed and fearless cavaliers, struck up, unbidden, that famous tune of old, the “War song of the Cid”—the soldiers clashing their arms in unison, and the wild cadences of the shrill brass piercing each ear and stirring every heart, they marched back to the city full of exulting valor, parched with the thirst of vengeance. A few hours later in the day, a dozen horses led to and fro before the doors of a large building, with a considerable crowd of grooms and servitors and several sentinels on duty, betokened something of more than ordinary import to be in process of enactment. It was the government house, before the gates of which that concourse was assembled; and in an upper chamber, the governor, with his chief officers, was sitting in high council. Melendez, as became his station no more than his skill and mature wisdom, presided at the board; Pedro, Gutierrez, and the veteran Diego were seated the nearest to his person; the captains of the four caravellas now at anchor in the bay lent their co-operating aid, and the bold youth, Don Amadis Ferrajo, though scarce entitled by his years to such proud eminence, had earned, by the brilliant reputation of his impetuous valor, a place there which he filled with as much of dignity as did the stateliest veteran of them all. At the lower end of the long table were placed two secretaries fully engaged in minuting the orders of the council; while just below a sort of bar, that ran across the council chamber, two Spanish veterans, well armed with sword and halberd, watched over a young stalwart negro, who stood between them, entirely naked, except a cloth about his loins, and a pair of Indian moccasins upon his feet, with manacles of steel upon his hands, but with a high free port and bold demeanor. In a recess, likewise, below the bar, usually covered by a curtain, which was now drawn up, a fearful-looking instrument, composed of many wheels and springs of steel, over which leaned a truculent dark-visaged ruffin, showed the full means to which the council had recourse to elicit truth from stubborn prisoners or unwilling witnesses. Pointing to this recess, with its appalling contents, Don Juan was in the act of speaking to the prisoner, when he was interrupted by his saying, in very tolerable Spanish. “There is no need of that, your Excellency! —without compulsion I am ready to declare all that I know of these buccaneers—for that I do know something of them, it were quite needless to deny. I have dealt with then often —sold them my fish and vegetables; and very liberal buyers are they too—somewhat rough handed at odd times, but what of that—if they did slice off my old comrade Xavier's ears for selling a raw Englishman a lot of gulls for wildfowl, they gave him gold enough to buy his freedom afterward. Yes? yes! I know all their haunts—and I will tell the truth—yes! I will betray them all—lead you up to their very hold—now they have carried off the fair young Senora, who had ever a sweet smile and a kind word for the poor blacks. As for the proud young Don, they might have tortured him to all eternity, ere I would have told aught against them—but now, now that they have carried off Teresa—” “This to me, dog?”—Melendez interrupted him, in tones that revealed the violence of his feelings—“Know you to whom you speak? This to me, to me, villain? Seize him, you halberdiers, strip him, and drag him to the rack. By the bones of St. James of Compostella, he shall taste straightway of these tortures he prates about so glibly!—yes! by the sacred souls of the martyrs, he shall die under them!” “For Heaven's sake, hold, your Excellency,?'—Diego whispered in his ear—“or we shall get no word from him. I know the knave of old! He is as stubborn as an old mule of Arragon, and has, I believe, no more feeling than a fish. Suffer his insolence, for God's sake—so by his guidance we may save your daughter.” “You say very well, Sir Don Diego”—interrupted the free black, who had overheard him—“You say very well and wisely. For if he gave me one wrench on that cursed rack I would not speak one word to him; and if he were to kill me, you know, that would bring him no nearer to recovering his daughter. No! no! it is no use to hurt me—not the least in the world. Besides, I did not mean to vex him when I spoke—I was thinking aloud only, and wouldn't have said it, if I'd thought—not but what it was quite true. I wont deny that it was quite true. But lord! it would be no use racking me—you'd just as well get Spanish words out of a big old alligator down in the castle ditch, as you'd get anything but curses out of me by all your torturing. But as I said before—I'll tell you all the truth, and bring you right upon them, now that they've carried off Teresa. Yes! yes! I know where they 're gone, and I'll carry all of you after them— but not with those big caravellas—they draw quite too much water. But you can take the ships' boats in, and mount some heavy guns in the long fishing pirogues—and then—yes! yes! then you can catch the rogues, and kill them— and eat them if you like, too, for that matter— but I suppose you don't care so much about that—and save the pretty Senora—for I don't think they've done her much harm yet—he's an honest chap, is that Ringwood, to be such an infernal thief—and pay them for screwing the young Don, down there. Yes! yes! that will be better much better that racking me; now won't it?” and he burst into a yell of most obstreperous laughter. “May we trust—think you, good Diego—in this knowledge that he boasts of?” whispered Melendez to his veteran counsellor. “Unquestionably may we”—answered the other, in the same low tones. “There's not a bayou or lagoon, a river or salt creek in all Florida he does not know as well as his own hat—nor a sand key, or solitary rock along the coast, but he has once and again explored it. Besides he is in league of amity with the red Indians, the wild Seminoles; and if he chooses he can bring out the warriors of their tribe to aid us. He is a faithful knave, too, and a valiant; though somewhat bold of speech, and to the windward not a little of due reverence for his superiors—yet no man ever heard him tell a lie, or break a promise! Best place full trust in him! Heard you not what he said of the Senora? since she was but a child he loved her— and he knows, as I hear, right well the character of the great English Rover.” “Well, fellow, you can guide us, as you say, and will. Well then, suppose we trust you, shall we set forth, and how?” “You shall set sail to-night—directly”— answered the negro promptly—“with your four caravellas; and make all speed quite round Cape Florida—and then run sixty miles up, close along the coast—then get out all the boats, and man them full; and take along with you fifteen or twenty big pirogues the fishermen came in this morning after the storm, filled full of soldiers, and with heavy guns. There is a narrow—oh very narrow—creek, not ten yards quite across, puts in there from the sea, covered with manchinell and mangroves so no eye can discover it—up that you shall row twenty, aye, nigh thirty miles, and there you will find a big clear lake, with fort, and village, and feluccas—there live the pirates! their stronghold.” “And you can pilot us? So be it, then!” “No! no!” replied the black, “pilot you I could very well; but that won't do!—no! no! if you go up alone, the pirates fire on you from the bush, cut you up quite, beat you all to the devil—no! no! my comrade Xavier, he best must pilot you. I must get out old Tigertail—the great chief of the Seminoles, with his red warriors, and go quiet quite through the forest—so when you take them front, we fall upon their back, and shoot them every way— destroy them altogether. Don Amadis go along with us—he'll go along with black Antonio, he'll go—he fears not anything!— take fifty musket men, and with the Indians we'll do—yes! yes! we'll do quite well, and save Teresa!” “He's right, your Excellency, black Antonio is right,” exclaimed the eager Amadis. “I'll go with him, by St. Jago! He shames us all for wisdom!—and hark, Antonio, I'll take a hundred men, not fifty—a hundred of my own old Castilians. Where will you find the Indians?—where's Xavier?—quick! quick, speak.” “Xavier's below, Don Amadis, he was along with me when these kind gentlemen,” looking toward the halberdiers, “laid hold of me, and he wont stir, till he sees me! And for the Indians, never fear but I can find them—get you your men into marching trim, with lots of ball and ammunition; and let each soldier bring a spare firelock with him, so can we arm a hundred of the Seminoles, and meet me at the land gate by sunset, and we'll get under weigh at once”' “Hold! hold!” replied Melendez, evidently speaking in great agitation and much doubt, “this will not do, I fear, no! no! It will be quite impossible to act in concert; we shall fall on at different times, and so be beaten in detail.” “Not so, fair sir,” the negro answered eagerly, “the Indian runners will watch all your movements from the shore, and bring us word into the bush, when you have pulled up into the stream, and how you prosper!—no fear but we can act in concert!” For a few moments the stern governor mused deeply, the dark expression and hard lines of his bold visage showing no tokens of incertitude or agitation; yet the broad hand, which he had laid upon the board, quivered perceptibly, and he kept beating his heel with a quick nervous action against the footstool, which was placed before his honorary chair. “Remove the negro,” he said at length, raising his eyes slowly from the floor on which they had been riveted—“treat him with kindness, but keep strict ward on him—begone!” A little bustle took place, while the halberdiers were leading off Antonio, and the secretaries, in obedience to a signal from Don Juan, were withdrawing from the chamber. The moment it ceased, however, Melendez rose from his seat; and casting his eyes round the circle as if to read the thought of each of his advisers, addressed them firmly, with a voice, low-pitched indeed, and perhaps somewhat subdued, but steady withal and unfaltering. “Gentlemen,” he began, “and comrades. I am a father, as ye know; and, as a father, must feel deeply the appalling situation of my most wretched child—must burn to rescue her from the pollution which, if it have not tainted, surrounds at least, and threatens her. I am a soldier likewise, and governor of this fair town; and, as such, am in honor bound and duty to fetter down all private sentiments obedient to my military devoir!—am bound to provide, before all things, for the good state and safety of this my loyal government. I am hard set, and look to all of you for council. Should we adopt the negro's plan, and trust to his guidance—as, if we move at all in this same business, I see not how we can do else—there is good cause to hope! great cause to fear. If he be trustworthy, and if his plan succeed, we shall preserve Teresa—root out, and utterly destroy a nest of pestilent accursed pirates, and win great booty, and no small renown! If on the other hand we fail—which we may do right easily—our whole force must be annihilated—nor is this all! We must so weaken the garrison here at St. Augustine, for to make any head against them we shall need every man that we can muster—that if we be beaten, and the buccaneers follow, as they doubtless will, the blow, they might well win the city! Thus stands the case—there is a mighty gain! there is a mighty peril! I can not—I dare not decide!—for I cannot distinguish, so fiercely is my soul disturbed, between a parent's passion and a leader's duty! Speak ye in order, then! Diego—first! and oh speak honestly and freely!” Before he had sat down, the old greyheaded warrior started to his feet; and cool although he was, and guarded for the most part, he spoke as hotly now—as passionately as a boy! “The question, gentlemen, is this—this absolutely! ONLY! Whether we shall give up a woman—a Christian maid—a Spanish lady— to the brutal violence of these incarnate fiends —without one blow—one effort to relieve her; or march with all our power to liberate her if we may! to die for her if we may not! Being myself a Spaniard, a soldier, and a knight, I have but one reply to this question, and see not how a Juan could find a second! we must essay it with all our best endeavors, and leave the rest to God!” “Not for the maiden's sake alone,” exclaimed Gutierrez eagerly, “though that were ample cause! but as I see the matter, in duty to our king we stand bound to avenge the insult offered to his flag, in duty to humanity to hunt out wretches, who set its every dictate at defiance, in duty to the laws of common policy to strike at the foe in his own place of strength, rather than wait his pleasure to assault our weakness!” “Besides,” cried Pedro, “we are far stronger than our ordinary power by aid of these stout caravellas—their crews will double our effective strength!” “I brought with me, a private volunteer, one hundred picked Castilians, bound to no duties, save at mine own will,” cried Amadis, with fiery vehemence; “if not a soldier else stir from the city gates, I, with my men, march out to-night at sunset!” “And I,” exclaimed the elder and superior of the four Spanish sea captains, “as in obedience to my broad letters of commission, shall sail this night with my four frigates, to take burn, sink, and by all means, destroy and harass the foemen of my king and country! Eight hundred stont hands can we muster for boat service; leaving enough behind to work and guard the caravellas! Do you, Sir Governor, embark six hundred more of your best veterans on board us, press every fisherman and mariner to follow us, with every boat, pirogue, or galley, they can find; let this young cavalier go with his followers to join the Indians, and my life on the issue!” “Be it so, gentlemen! Fair thanks to all for your good courtesy! and may God guard the right. You, Don Diego, I leave here—nay, it must be so, my good friend—lieutenant in my absence. Pedro, Gutierrez, let the drums beat to arms!—muster the garrison in the great square! pick out six hundred, the youngest and best soldiers!—let each man have his morion and breast plate, but no back piece, brassards or taslets; each man a musket with a hundred round of cartridge, broadsword and dagger, and two pistols! Ye gentlemen of the marine will see them on board straightway! A word with thee, Don Amadis! Ye to your duties, gentlemen, anon I will be with ye!” “Amadis,” he continued, as soon as they were left alone, “win her and wear her! If God give you the grace to rescue her, before God shall you wed her. Get your men under arms, take with you black Antonio, and God speed you!” Trumpets pealed wildly through the streets —the drums rolled long and loud—and, with the clash of arms and tramp of marshalled footsteps, the veterans of the garrison were mustered! Before the sun set, the tall caravellas had cleared the landlocked bay, staggering out to sea with a fair breeze, each stitch of canvas set that they could carry; and his last glances fell upon the little party of Don Amadis, filing away under the guidance of the faithful negro, into the pathless forest. CHAPTER VII. It was already afternoon when Ringwood left the cabin; so far had the recital of his tale, broken by violent fits of wrathful indignation, and bursts of fiery passion, trespassed upon the day. When he reached the deck, he found he had conjectured, justly, the cause of the bustle overhead, which had excited his attention, while in the very heat and tumult of his remembered wrongs and meditated vengeance. The vessel was now heading to the northward, having already rounded the extremity of Florida, and, with the wind on her laboard beam, blowing strong and warm directly from the Gulf, was running close in shore along the western coast of that forest-mantled promon tory. The alteration in the course of the felucca, and corresponding changes of her trim and tackling, had, therefore, as Ringwood supposed, produced the sounds on deck—confusion tending unto order. The wide spread studding sails which had protruded many feet beyond her ordinary yard-arms, wooing the favorable breeze, while, previous to their doubling the cape, it had fallen full upon her starboard quarter, were now reduced, her topsails reefed, and her topgallant yards sent down, as if in preparation for a storm, although no cloud or speck of vapor was visible on the bright clear horizon. Her consorts, close behind her, were gliding along gently under the same easy sail, in obedience, as it seemed, to a set of signals floating at Ringwood's fore, and thence repeated by each following barque of the squadron, which came on singly, in long file, the leading vessel being a mile, at least, in advance of the last. The waves, or wavelets rather—for though the breeze blew steadily and strong, the surface of the Gulf was, notwithstanding, singularly calm and level—were as bright, and almost as transparent as a sheet of crystal; every rock, every coral reef that rose sheer from the white and sandy bottom—nay, every green variety of ocean-grass and weed, every bright shell and gorgeous sea-flower that studded, as with a thousand living gems, the glistening pavement of the deep, was visible as clearly as though no denser medium than the air were interposed between them and the eye that gazed in rapture on their wonders. Scores of bright flying fish, their white scales glancing silvery to the sunshine, their wing-like fans fast flashing, leaped up from the small ripples, momently, and vanished beneath them; the blue shark shot along, suspended, as it were, in the transparent waters, leaving behind him a long streak of flashing lustre; the albatross soared high upon his snow-white pinion, while gulls and sea-swallows, and petals of every size and color skimmed the calm deep in the pursuit of prey or pleasure. To the right, meanwhile, lay the low shores of Florida, glowing with mingled tints of almost magical verdure. Tall palms, with their soft, feathery tops, towering far, far up into the blue serene, above the denser foliage of the oaks and locusts which blended with giant cedars; and the funereal cypress, hung with long wreaths of pale and ghostly moss, composed the eternal forest—the forest which, in its turn, overpowering thousands of flowering shrubs: magnolias, with their vast chalices of odoriferous snow; and dogwood, bright with unnumbered star-like blossoms: roses of every hue: calmias, and rhododendrons, and azalias, with manyfold and clustered bloom, varying from pure white, through all the shades of blush, and pink, and violet, to gorgeous kingly purple. And above all, the orange, that young bride of the vegetable world, enriching all the atmosphere with powerful and almost oppressive perfume. Bushes of manchineal and mangrove fringed the low banks, growing far out into the shallow waters, which actually laved their roots, and floated the long wreaths of massive greenery that garlanded their pendulous branches. Hard by the outer verge of this sea cradled coppice, with little room to spare between her tall topgallant masts and the wide-reaching limbs of the huge forest trees which, here and there, protruding from the brow of some bluff eminence, or island knoll, overhung the navigable channel, the gallant picaroon shot onward, her bellying sails shimmering white in the meridian sunbeams, and the glad waters foaming before her sharp, lean bows, rippling with a hoarse laughter along her beautifully moulded sides, and forming in her wake a broad and frothy furrow, where, parted for a moment by her fleet transit, they foamed and frolicked as if they joyed in their reunion. Fair blew the western breeze, and fresh; and, as the sun turned westward in his path of glory, it freshened more and more: and as the shades of evening grew less distant, fleeter it waxed, and stronger, till it became a stiff, though not unfavorable gale. Long before this, had the topgallant masts of the felucca been housed; and now her topsails were close reefed, and still with undiminished speed—now lying over as the gale fell full and steady on her distended canvas, till her long yards seemed on the point of dipping into the waves to leeward; now surging up again with graceful elasticity in every temporary lull —the rapid barque flew through the gurgling waters. Fast flew she, nor less fast did her gay consorts follow; nor did the winged hours flag more than they in their career across the firmament. The day was nigh spent, and the dim presage of approaching night was stealing fast over the azure vault, on the last western verge of which, his lower rim already merged in its ocean bed, glowing like a red furnace with his borrowed lustre—half the sun's disk of gold hung on the very point of disappearing. A thousand purple tints were creeping over the bright pure sky; a thousand rosy gleams were flickering upon the glassy waves, most like the varying hues seen on the changeful scales of the expiring dolphin: and now he plunged into the deep. For a few seconds, long, radiant streams of many-colored light, ruby, and pink, and violet, checkered the darkening arch: these passed away, and a deep purple shadow swept slowly, as projected from a curtain interposed, across the firmament of heaven—across the laughing waters. Scarcely, however, had that purple shade pervaded the whole visible universe, before another change succeeded. Myriads of stars, planets, and stationary orbs, and confused milky constellations, burst out at once, like eyes unclouded from sleep, beaming, or twinkling with quick diamond rays, from every quarter of the deep blue, viewless ether, which stretched away, contrasted to their sudden brilliancy, far, far—a vast abyss of lustrous blackness. Still fair and freshly blew the breeze—still the bark bounded onward, eager as the worn steed, which all forgets his weariness as he draws nigh his stall. “Ho! Cunninghame,” exclaimed the Rover, pausing in his walk to and fro on his brief quarter-deck. “Ho! we be here at last—bid them beat instantly to quarters.” The order had been anticipated by the crew before the words were spoken—the drummer had assumed his instrument, and the men were already mustered in divisions, expectant of the call to quarters; for they had made the last well remembered headland, a short league to the southward of their harbor. Taking his cue then from the Rover's words, almost before his officer had issued the command, the long roll of the drum might be heard mingling with the sweet sign of the sea breeze; and with the first rattle the strong-handed crew flew to their proper stations. “Down with the helm, and square away the yards.” The rattling of the blocks succeeded, and the harsh straining of the cordage, mixed with a rumbling creak, as the huge yards obeyed their impulse; and instantly the graceful ship fell off before the wind, and stood with accelerated speed directly towards the shore, which she had hugged all day. “Away there, topmen!” and with the word, the nimble hands were hurrying up the rigging, and ready for the next command. “In with your fore and mizen topsails,” and ere five minutes had elapsed, the sails were clued up in festoons, and the ponderous yards upon the caps. “House the foretopmast,” followed; and instantly the heel of that huge spar ran half way down to the lower mast—“House the mizen topmast. In with the main topsail. House the main topmast.” These orders were immediately obeyed; and in less than ten minutes from the time when she had kept away, the felucca was dashing, as it seemed, dead ashore, with her three topmasts struck, her yards a-cockbill, and not one stitch of canvas, save the foresail, set. Before her lay the shore, low as it has been described and level—bordered with a deep fringe of floating verdure—among and over which the surf, set in by the strong western gale, broke high and stormy, and covered far aloft with the impenetrable and eternal foliage of the tropical forest! Behind her whistled the driving breeze, and swelled the rolling billows! on she came, fast and fearless! and now her bows were almost battered in the upflashing surf! yet was there visible no opening in the 3 low-growing mangroves—no gap in the vast mass of leafy blackness, which stood out like a wall in clear and palpable relief against the starry sky! one thing, however, might have been marked by a sailor's eye, although a landsman would scarce have discerned the sign, or known its meaning, if he had discoverd it. Right under the light vessel's bowsprit there showed one narrow spot where the surf broke not, where undisturbed the floating mangroves reposed upon a streak, for it was nothing more, of dark blue water, scarcely ten yards in width, where for a little space the giant timber that overhung them receded from the margin of the billows. Right upon this the felucca steered, the practised hand of no less a mariner than Ringwood wielding the obedient tiller! Right upon this she steered, as though she followed a well known and easy channel into a secure harbor. “Ready there forward with the long starboard falconet!” demanded the clear accents of the Rover. “Ready, Sir!” was the quick response. “Then fire!” a stream of vivid flame burst from the bow port of the picaroon, driving a cloud of snow white smoke before it, and the loud booming voice of the heavy gun succeeded. Immediately a quick thin flash was seen ashore, followed by the report of a carbine—and then, right in the centre of the little bay formed by the recess of the forest trees, directly over the space of dark blue water, a blaze of red light burst forth sharp and dazzling, a dusky crimson glare, in which the bright green foliage of the underwood, and the rugged stems of the huge timber trees, the purple billows, and the dark sky, glowed with a deep and lurid tinge. “Stand by there, with the grapnels!” On! on! she darted—the thick embowered manchineals were pierced by her long tapering bowsprit—her cut-water plunged into their dense greenery—the parted branches rattled and scraped right against her lean bows as they severed them—the leaves, entangled in her rigging, were torn violently from their parent branches; a moment, and she had passed through them; and with the impulse of her previous motion, was rushing up a deep but narrow river—so narrow, that there were scarcely six clear feet of space between her bulwarks and the shore on either hand. “Heave” —and the iron grapplings, whirled by strong hands and with a will, rattled among the tangled coppice—“On shore there!” “Aye! aye!” “Haul taut, and belay!” and instantly, from either bow, a strong rope was dragged forcibly ashore by unseen hands, and made fast to the giant trunks which shaded both banks of that dark stream with an unbroken barrier—the vessel was checked from her way, and after lying for a few seconds motionless, yielded to the strong tide which was setting like a mill-race outward, and fell aft to the full swing of her cable. “Get hands enough ashore now, Master Cunninghame; carry out warps, and swing her round the point—look alive! look alive! Godslife—the Albicore is close in shore even now; heave at the capstan ho!—round with it, men, round with it! or she'll be into us stem on!” Scarce forty yards from the embouchure of the river, the channel turned at a sharp angle round a low point into a small round basin; whence with a tortuous route the stream might be traced, turbid and black and swift, but singularly narrow, for miles into the heart of the forest, to the far source where it boiled up at once, from the bowels of the earth into a large broad pool—so deep that never lead had found its bottom, even at its birth a river. Upon this point a little knot of men was gathered: and here the light had been displayed at the felucca's signal, which had now quite expired. The men wrought eagerly and well; and many minutes had not passed before the picaroon swung roung the point into the little landlocked basin; just as a gun from the Albicore announced her proximity, and was replied to, as before, by a brief exhibition of the same crimson light. Meanwhile the Rover had got all his boats out, and strongly manned; so that before the second barque rounded the inner point, he was already under weigh, towing, and sweeping, where the stream occasionally widened, and warping through its frequent windings towards its sequestered source; hearing, each after each, the signal guns of his consorts as they made the cove, and confident that, for a time at least, all were secure from peril, whether of wind or warfare. Through all that livelong night the crews toiled faithfully by gangs, plying the oars in the light whale-boats, or laboring with more severe exertions at the huge sweeps of the felucca! All night they toiled; but not all night did Ringwood, wearied with past labor and yet more overdone by struggling with his own furious passions, watch on the guarded deck. At midnight, or a little after, descending the companion stairs, he sought the privacy of his own cabin. Erect and stern the negro sentry stood at his wonted post, presenting arms as his proud leader passed. “Let Charon call my steward,” he said, “bid him bring food and wine.” “Even now it waits you, noble sir,” answered the black attendant, “this hour or more it hath been prepared.” Without more words the Rover entered his apartment, and blithely did it show, and cheerfully by the bright radiance of the large crystal lamps, suspended from the gilded beams, and throwing into every angle and recess a flood of clear illumination. The large square board, still cumbered with its accustomed load of books and charts, papers scrawled over with problems of singular and abstruse calculation, quadrant, and astrolabe, and compass, and other instruments of singular device, and, as in those days it was deemed, rare virtue, had been wheeled aside; in its stead a small round table, covered with a cloth of brilliant whiteness, and bearing all provocatives to tempt a languid appetite, now occupied the centre of the cabin. A single cover of richly chased and burnished gold, with spoons and forks of the same precious metal; a goblet, rough with work of Benvenuto's graver; several tall rummers of thin Venice glass, flanked by two flasks of wine, appropriate decorations to a cold larded capon, a salted neat's tongue, caviar, and other delicacies of a like thirsty nature. Yet did the pirate chief manifest little inclination to taste the dainties, which, till he saw them set before him, he fancied he had needed. He threw himself into a velvet-cushioned chair, which stood beside the board, stretched out his legs, and covering his face with his broad hand, remained for many minutes silent, absorbed in deep and gloomy meditation. At length he started up and sat erect, gazing about him with a strange bewildered glance, as if he had expected to discover some one whose voice had roused him from his lethargy; within a second's space, however, he was calm and collected as before. “Marvellous, marvellous, indeed!” he said, thinking aloud as it were, and probably unconscious that his thoughts had found utterance; “marvellous tricks our truant fancy plays us; but, tush!—I am outdone with weariness and watching, my mind wanders.” He stood up and drew his hand across his forehead, as if to pluck aside some cloud which veiled his mental eyesight; then seizing a tall flagon of champagne, he untwisted the wire which secured the cork, decanted one half of its generous and foamy liquor into a mighty glass of Venice crystal, quaffed it off at a single draught, and replaced the goblet. Then, as if conquering his deeply-seated loathing, he applied himself to carve the capon, placed a few morsels on his platter, and forced himself to swallow a mere mouthful. But it was all in vain! Again he had recourse to the rich wine; and, after drinking it, fell back into his chair, and as before mused deeply; dark frowning shadows stealing across his broad fair brow, and strange emotions curling his lip at times with a fierce sneering spasm; anon these gloomy signs passed over, and were succeeded by a severe though sad expression: as if some tender melancholy recollection had swept over the unfolded tablets of his soul, and erased for the moment thence each darker stain of sin or worldly sorrow. “ 'Tis strange,” he said, again, after a long deep pause, “ 'tis passing strange, how at this time the images of by-gone scenes, aye, to the very verdure of the trees, and shadows thrown by the yellow sunbeams athwart the laughing landscape, array themselves before mine eyes, in palpable distinctness. Yet was there no link—no chain in the tenor of my thought to join these visions of the past, with the utility of the stern present. Strange, they are very strange indeed, these pranks of the imagination! Those boyish reminiscences were clear upon my spirit, as the events of yesterday—every word that I spoke myself, every tone that I marked of others—and thou, thou too, my sister! The ancient village church—the quiet and sequestered pew in the shadowy corner— the sunbeams full of dusty motes streaming in through the oriel window—the humble devout congregation—the old grey-headed curate— aye! I could hear the very accents of his sonorous voice, could mark the hum of the responses, could hear the lisping trill of thy small girlish treble—my sister—my lost sister!—as we did kneel together on the bright Sabbath mornings—as we did kneel—and pray!—pray —pray,” he muttered, as though the sense of the word had escaped his understanding; then struck his forehead heavily with his expanded palm, “and now!” he said, “and now! Well —well, it is no matter!” and, rallying by a violent effort his seattered senses, he quaffed off a third goblet of champagne, and moving with a rapid and firm step towards the starboard state room of his cabin, seemed as though on the point of opening the door; but just as his hand touched the latch he paused, for the low sound of regular calm breathing fell on his ear. “Aye —aye!” he said, “aye—I had forgotten!” He turned away, and entering the alcove between the two small chambers, looked long and with a fervent and excited gaze upon the lovely picture which hung there, with that serene and innocent smile which, like a seraph's voice, seemed to pour something of consolatory hope into the bosom—worn as it was and blighted, and filled at that very instant by turbulent and fiery conflict between good thoughts and evil, of him who gazed on it so fixedly. His eye, as he withdrew it from the picture, fell on the crucifix of gold, which stood upon the little table under it—and, moved as he was by a strange and long unfelt revulsion, he knelt down before it, and burying his head in his clasped hands, burst at once into a flood of wild hysterical weeping. “I know not,” he said thoughtfully, as he arose, “I know not—would God that I did! Cunninghame, now, would term this naught but a heated mind working upon a weary body —but no! no! I know it not—it is not so! Why do I doubt? I who have never doubted, or pity, whose revenge has had no check or stay of mercy! Whence, whence these retrospections to the long, long-forgotten past?— these journeyings backward of the soul to pure and innocent days? Whence this insatiable and longing wish for rest—for rest—for something stiller than mere repose—sounder than earthly sleep—more peaceful than tranquillity itself? Wherefore this loathing of hot action, for which till now I have alone existed? Is it that coming death is even now spreading above me the shadow, the prophetic gloom of his approach? Is it, that now but one deed more rests to be done, until my great revenge shall be completed, and I may lay me down, my last toil ended, and sleep—sleep dreamlessly, soundly, and for ever! and yet that one deed? that one deed? no! no! no! Great God, it cannot be —and still—my oath! why, why, doth she look like my sister? Well! well! to-morrow will be time enough! to-morrow!” Still gazing thoughtfully about him, and walking to and fro with his right hand firmly pressed upon his forehead, and his left hanging down by his side tightly clenched and quivering, he mused a little longer, then locking the outer door of his cabin, he turned into his state-room; and without altering his dress, or drawing off his buskins, wrapped his watch-cloak about him, and threw himself on his cot; where motionless and seeming in tranquil sleep he lay, till the morning sun shone broad and bright into the stern windows, pouring a flood of golden light upon the cold stern features which felt not, nor acknowledged the genial warmth of its young lustre. CHAPTER VIII. The strong beams of the morning sun, pouring a flood of emerald-tinted lustre, caught from the leafy arches through which they made their way, into the stern lights of the Rover's cabin, aroused him from his troubled slumbers. He rose up on the instant in perfect possession of all his senses, drew his hand once or twice across his fine broad brow, as if to wipe away some thought that had sat heavy there during the hours of sleep, and then plunged his whole head into an ewer of cold water, to cool its feverish throbbing. This done, and his disordered dress arranged with somewhat finical nicety, he hastened to the deck of his galley, where his presence was hailed with a shout of enthusiastic rapture by the assembled crew. The scene was widely altered since the preceding sunset; for now the pirate squadron lay calmly floating in a small wood-girt basin, so exquisitely clear and glassy, that every line and moulding of the vessels, every small rope and fluttering pennant, was drawn to the very life on the dark mirror of the still deep waters; and it might well have tasked the strongest vision to define the exact place where the sub stance and the shadow met, so wonderfully were they blended. At first sight it appeared that this small pool or lakelet, which was so nearly circular that it might have been fancied artificial, and in no direction was it a quarter of a mile across, although so marvellously deep that the deepest sealine had never yet found bottom, though run out to five hundred fathoms, was altogether landlocked, and had no outlet for its brimming waters; for it was hedged around on every side but one, by the dense brakes and ever-living umbrage of the tropical forest, and there the shore sloped gently upward in a rich turfy lawn of the tenderest verdure. On a nearer inspection, however, it was not difficult to detect the spot, by the opening in the tree-tops, where rushed from that secluded spring the powerful and abundant stream, which boiled up from the bowels of the earth, here at its very birth a river; although it made so short a turn immediately on quitting the parent basin, that no part of its course was visible. Immediately on the water's edge, where the smooth lawn sloped upward, forming a gentle hillock, a long green mound of short close greensward, cut into many an angular zigzag, many a crescent, and wedged ravelin, and abutting at either extremity on a small half-moon bastion of wrought stone, presented a terrible array of batteries mounted with above a hundred black-mouthed cannon, grinning defiance to any bold invader who should penetrate so deeply into the Rover's haunts as to reach this his inmost hold, many a mile aloof from the blue billows of the Mexican Gulf. From either bastion there was drawn a line of powerful stoccades facing an eastern rampart with many salient angles, running entirely round the hillock between its grassy esplanade and the deep masses of the forest which surrounded it; and a broad ditch cut with vast labor through the swampy soil, and lined with square hewn timber completely isolated the position, which had been chosen with so much skill, and fortified so masterly by the directions of the great English Rover. The space within the lines, which might have formed an area of a mile's circuit, contained many long wooden buildings, erected at right angles to each other, with wide verandahs and long porticoes, all clustered round the base of the hill, presenting a picturesque and gay appearance; for they were painted tastefully enough with white and green in broad contrasting stripes, like some of the modern Italian villas, and all the verandahs were furnished with curtained awnings of the most sumptuous and magnificent materials, velvets and rich brocades, and gold and silver tissues, more like the fanciful pavilions of some fairy palace, than the adornments of a piratical stronghold. Around the crest of the little hill, commanding the whole area, and forming evidently the citadel of the position, a triple line of earthen ramparts, with deep dry ditches, crowned with chevaux de frise, and mounted with long culverins, guarded the scarped ascent, and encircled a large keep or block-house, which occupied the summit of the knoll—the Rover's palace-castle. Such was the scene which lay brightly illuminated by the low morning sunbeams, but checkered here and there with cool blue shadows, cast by the forest trees and grotesque buildings over the emerald lawn, under the eyes of Ringwood. But though he was no mean judge, nor careless observer of the wild charms of nature, he had gazed too often on that strange and lovely prospect, to give at this time more than a passing glance to its attractions; besides, the moment had its duties. There was of course no anchorage in that unfathomed gulf, whereon the low and rakish picaroons floated so calmly; they were moored, therefore, in shore, for the banks were all abrupt and molden, by hooks and grapnels; Ringwood's felucca, as the largest, lying the furthest from the batteries, and covering the outlet of the river with her broadside. The other barks were anchored to the shore at various points, so as to concentrate their fire on the same spot, much further up the basin and under the very guns of the fort, the smallest of the squadron lying directly in front of the water-gate, and covered by the eastern bastion. The crews, it would appear, of all the rest, had already landed; for with the exception of a single sentinel on the forecastle of each, not a soul was to be seen on board; while, dotting everywhere the verdant area of the fort, some lounging idly in the cool shadows of the curtained porticoes, some walking to and fro in little groups and parties, some dallying with gaily dressed, light-mannered girls, two or three hundred of the buccaneers were visible; while from within the dwellings, loud bursts of revelry, mingled with the sweet laughter and half sportive shrieks of women, and now and then a gay licentious song, or the tinkling of a lute, betokened the presence of many more inhabitants than met the gazer's eye. “Ha! Anson,” exclaimed Ringwood, addressing one of his subordinate officers with a smile, “I have played something overmuch the sluggard; and these good fellows are, I warrant me, fretting to be ashore among the bona robas yonder. So to it, sir, at once; hoist all the boats out presently, except my private pinnace, and have the people landed. Keep the barge to the last; I will ashore in it myself.” A louder acclamation than that even which had greeted the appearance of the rover on his deck, now burst forth from the merry crew, as they rushed with tumultuous hurry to their quarters, eagerly urging their light duty, and hoisting out the boats with many a jovial cheer and hasty halloa! For a few minutes the great buccaneer stood looking on in silence, till the last boat had pushed off with its noisy freight, leaving the barge's crew alone, waiting for their superiors, who were grouped on the forecastle; and the small private pinnace swinging beneath the stern-lights of the cabin. Then motioning his officers to wait for his return, he descending the companion-stair, and once more entered his own cabin. “Pluto!” he cried, “Ho! Pluto!” as he entered; and as the negro sentinel thrust in his turbaned head, at the half-opened door—“jump up on deck, and clear away my pinnace; bring it round to the starboard gangway, and after we shall have left the ship—I and the gentlemen —do thou and Charon lead down the lady there, and the black lass, and row them to the sally-port, entering the covered way: I will be there to meet ye; and hark, sirrah, in your ear—do thou, or thy swart comrade, but once look lustfully upon their beauties, and thou shalt wish thyself dead fifty times, ere death shall end thy tortures. See to it, and begone;” then, as the negroes hurried forth to execute his orders, “Teresa!” he called aloud—“come forth, Teresa!” There was a pause of a few minutes, interrupted only by a slight rustling sound as if of female garments, from the state-room; but no one answered anything; nor did she, when he called, come forth. “What, ho!” he cried again: “come forth, come forth, Teresa! or, by the Lord that lives, you shall repent it. Best not provoke me, beauty.” As he spoke the door opened, and the sweet girl came forth, somewhat refreshed, indeed, by sleep, but with her clear and luminous skin still pale as alabaster; so that her large dark eye, contrasted with the singular whiteness of her face, showed almost supernaturally full and lustrous. Her hair had been arranged in neat, broad plaits, wound simply round the classic contour of her head; and over her high brow a single heavy curl falling down with a massive sweep behind each delicate ear; but her neck, and the first gentle swell of her young bosom, were all bare, and her round dimpled arms uncovered to the shoulders; yet, even in her disarray, there was a true dignity in every motion, so rigid and severe a modesty in the chaste, sorrowful eye, so perfect an air of unconsciousness of aught unseemly—although, indeed, she was most conscious—that the most hardened debauchee could no more have found matter for voluptuous thoughts there, than in the cold, denuded limbs of marble saint or angel. “I come,” she answered, her words flowing out in a calm, passionless, and even strain, as though her very fears were dead. “I come, obedient to your call, so to eschew worse outrage. I come; what would you?” “Sweet lady,” replied Ringwood, with a half-meaning courtesy of accent, “sweet, innocent lady, that you prepare you straightway to take boat, in charge of my staunch guardsmen, and so to my poor dwelling; there I will see you presently. Meantime, in yonder state-room are store of velvet mantles; take one of them, I pray you, and wrap you closely in its folds; and 'twere no evil done, if you should cast a silk kerchief, in lieu of veil, over those lovely lineaments. I would not give your charms to the brute gaze of the rude sailors.” “Wherefore, kind sir, and most considerate,” she said, a slight flush rising to her pallid cheek, “or to what purpose would you veil, to-day, me, whom, but two days ago, you did display in so unwomanly disarray to the same eyes from which you now would hide me? perchance from motives not pure and disinterested?” “Simply,” returned the rover, in a cold, resolute voice, “simply for that it is my will! and have a care—have thou a care, Teresa, provoke me not too far—I say provoke me not! It were as easy, every whit, to me, to strip your charms to the broad day, and so parade you to the gaping wonder of those brute mariners, as to say, `veil your beauties!' By God!” he added, lashing himself into fury as he proceeded, “by God! it were as easy to cast you forth a booty to the untamed licentiousness of those who know no mercy—as thus—” “As thus from selfish passion,” she interrupted him, “thus to reserve me for the more foul dishonor of your own private pleasures!” “Of my own private pleasures!” he repeated, mimicking the very tones of her voice—“of my own private pleasures! right daintily worded that, dear lady, and very true withal. My own most private pleasures, of which, believe me, sweet one, you soon shall be the most choice minister, and the well-pleased partaker—and now to punish you for this, your insolence, and teach you wisdom for the future!” And with the words, he made one quick step forward, and throwing both his arms round her fair form, one encircling her lovely shoulders and swan-like neck, the other twining with irresistible pressure her slight rounded waist, he clasped her to him in a close embrace, kissing her lips, and sucking her sweet breath, till she had well nigh fainted in his arms. She did not shriek, nor struggle—no more could she have struggled within the overpowering grasp of that gigantic frame, than could the linnet strive against the talons of the ger-falcon. She did not shriek; for there was none to hear; much less to aid, or rescue her. But yet she yielded not one jot—much less responded to his passionate caress—but stood within his circling arms, cold, rigid, stern, impassive as a wrought shape of bronze or marble—not a pulse in her body bounded beyond its usual motion; not a quicker throb of her bosom answered to the hot beatings of his heart—not a pant was on her breath, not a cloud on her clear steady eye, not a dew drop on her honeyed lip—but when he again released her from his arms, a faint brief color stole over her cheeks and brow, and, when it receded, left her even paler than before—and a quick shudder shook her limbs for a moment. “Thus deal I with the stuhborn,” said Ringwood, as he let her go, “thus deal I with the insolent and stubborn! see, if you like it not, that you offend not in like sort again! and now, do as I bid you, and make ready!” As he spoke, he turned on his heel, and leaving the cabin, rejoined his subordinates on deck, and shortly after going down into the barge threw himself at full length on the cushions in the stern sheets, and was pulled to shore as rapidly as twenty vigorous seamen could ply their oars in that calm basin. While she, deserted by the calm resolution which had borne her up while in the presence of her persecutor, and which a secret instinct rightly taught her to be the only weapon with which she could successfully oppose his forceful violence, burst instantly into a wild agony of tears and sobbing, and falling to the ground, continued in a series of fainting fits and swoons, until the terrified Cassandra, who had been twice already summoned by the negroes, brought her back to her senses, by her half frantic entreaties, that she would arise and obey the orders of the pirate, if she would save her life or honor. Then she aroused herself at once, as soon as she became conscious of her handpmaid's meaning; and casting one of the velvet cloaks around her, by a strong effort gulped down the whole of her hysterical passion, wiped away the traces of her tears, and followed the tall negro to the pinnace wherein his fellow was already seated at the oar. No princess of old Spain could have been treated with more ample courtesy, more deep respect, by the most stately cavalier of her proud court, than was Teresa by the two pirate blacks. Not a glance of their bright eyes rested upon her features for a moment— not a word was spoken, but such as were of absolute necessity; and, when she had taken her seat in the stern of the little boat with the black girl crouching as usual at her feet, the men took to their oars, and pulled as fast as they were able, in perfect silence, towards the sally-port, at the base of the western bastion, upon the battlements of which the stately figure of the great buccaneer was already visible, as he awaited the arrival of his captive. As the boat neared the port, however, he descended from his lofty stand; and as the keel grated upon the pebbly marge, the portcullis rose, the gate flew open, and displayed him standing within the low browed arch—a third negro, of similar dimensions to those who were assisting the girls from the boat, holding a flambean at his side. They had not entered one second's space, before the iron grating was again lowered, and the heavy gate swung back, leaving the boatmen on the outer side, and Teresa found herself in a low, narrow-vaulted passage, stretching away into interminable darkness, though continually ascending by flights of broad flat steps, as if towards the daylight; but little being rendered visible by the smoky torch of the negro, who preceded them in silence, except the key-stone of the rude arch overhead, and the mildewed walls on the right hand and left. “Take my arm, girl,” exclaimed Ringwood, “and lean on it! mind what I say to you, and forget not the lesson I was compelled to teach you, even now; which, by the heaven above `us! shall be as nothing to that which you shall learn, if you be any more refractory!” Pale as the winter's snow, and scarce less cold, she took his proffered arm, in silence but untrembling; and she did lean on him, for in good truth she was scarce able to support herself even when she entered; and the dank mildew vapors of that cold vault, wherein the drops of moisture were constantly detaching themselves from the roof and plashing on the muddy earth, had yet more overpowered her, so that full surely she had lacked the strength to drag her limbs along, has she not been supported by the nervous arm of Ringwood, to which she clung with a convulsive gripe of which she was indeed scarce conscious. After walking for some distance through this deep covered way, having ascended not less than a hundred steps at different times, and in various places—they reached a huge oak door, clenched with large nails, which gave them access to a tall winding staircase, carried up through a shaft in the earth, similar to a well, each step being a beam of solid timbers, hewn rudely with the axe, and all unconscious of the adze or plane of the neat-handed joiner. After ascending this rugged stairway, they reached a little vestibule, above the level of the ground, the floor and walls of which were covered with neat Indian mattings, lighted by a long shot-hole or crenelle, through which a golden sunbeam, full of a million dancing motes, streamed in, filling the little place with glorious light and gaiety, which seemed more lovely to those who viewed it in close contrast to the swart darkness of the subterranean galleries which they had but just quitted. From this small vestibule a second staircase, wrought in the thickness of the wall, quickly conducted. Ringwood and his fair captive—close to whom crept, more terrified a thousand times than her pale mistress, the black slave girl Cassandra— to a well-lighted airy hall, overlooking—as it was easy to perceive—from the upper story of the Rover's keep, the whole green end of the pirate fortress, with the gay dwellings and the glassy bay, and the beautiful vessels moored in their several berths, all laughing out in the glad golden sunlight, which poured down everywhere over the wide spread tropical forests, and over that small inland lakelet, from the soft smiling heavens. The hall in which they stood, lighted by four tall lattices, and looking down upon that romantic view, was itself worthy of attention from its magnificent and tasteful decorations. The ceiling of dark Indian wood, from which swung a vast golden lamp that once had decked some sacred edifice, was polished till it shone like a mirror; the walls, covered with hangings of green velvet, were all adorned with groups of glittering weapons, disposed in rare and picturesque patterns of every singular variety of forth and purpose. Shirts of ring-mail, and corslets of bright plate, and casques embossed with gold circular shields of oriental fashion. Damascus cimeters, and Spanish blades, and rare Italian daggers, all glittering with gems and flashing to the morning sun. The floor was carpeted with velvet, and a divan of the same rich material, corded and laced with gold, ran round the walls of the apartment; while on a massive table was spread a sumptuous collation, with many flagons of rich wine, and tall Venetian glasses, among rich meats and vases full of the dewy flowers of that rare southern clime. There were no tenants to this splendid hall, but from a door that faced the staircase, which had been partially left open, there came the mingled sounds of more than one sweet low-toned female voice; and once or twice a long soft thrilling laugh, that seemed to speak a heart at ease and happy. These sounds were followed, just as the Rover led his prisoner into that noble hall, by a light air touched exquisitely on a lute, and accompanied by a rich clear melodious voice of a girl singing. Her execution was admirable —her tones thrilled to the very heart like liquid fire—but, alas! the song was so passionately, painfully voluptuous, that it could have flowed from no modest lips, and should have been listened to by no modest ears. Pierced to the soul, Teresa faltered, and stood still—but Ringwood with a strong pressure of her arm, and a stern whisper of his deep penetrating voice, saying, “Beware! I say, beware, Teresa,” half led, half bore her onward to the door whence came those hateful sounds. He threw it open, and the sight she saw, stuck that unhappy girl,—more than the most dreadful of the dread scenes she had already witnessed—with agony and terror and despair. CHAPTER IX. The room to which Teresa was thus unwiilingly introduced, was of dimensions somewhat smaller than the hall or armory on which it opened, but far more graceful and luxurious in its decorations. Its casements, although high and spacious, and admirably calculated to admit every breath of air that might be stirring, were completely closed against the garish light by deep Italian awnings of peach-colored damask, striped with broad silver arabesques, through which the rays stole softly, mellowed to the same tender hue. The walls were hung with Genoa velvet of the same delicate color, divided into panels by rich frames of Venetian filagree in silver—the very floor was strewn with carpets of the same material—mirrors were everywhere in bright profusion, curtained with gauzy veils of the faintest pink— couches and ottomans of down, with covers of soft silk—tables and cabinets of marquetry and buhl completed the furniture of this voluptuous bower, the very atmosphere of which, like the haunts fabled by Grecian bards, of that Cytherean goddess, reeked by the perfumes redolent of love. But if the chamber and its decorations were in themselves luxurious almost beyond description, what words can paint the charms almost unearthly, the Aphrodisian air, the prodigal voluptuousness of its inmates? They were but three in number—three young and splendid girls, all the very flower and flush of young ripe womanhood—all beautiful—but oh! how different in their beauty. The first—she it was whose rich clear voice had reached Teresa's ear before she entered— was a rare specimen of that peculiar style of English loveliness, which, save to the voluptuary, is rendered far less lovely by the predominance in all its traits essential to intellectual thought—and yet she was indeed most beautiful. Her forehead, though rather low than otherwise, was whiter than the virgin snow-wreath, before the soft west wind has thawed its dazzling purity, and smooth as it was white—her delicately pencilled brows o'erarched a pair of large soft eyes swimming in liquid light—her nose was delicate and small her lips of the richest crimson, wooingly prominent, disclosed a set of teeth so pearly and transparent in their lustre, that they set simile at naught. Her hair, of the lightest and the most shining brown, was all dishevelled as it seemed,—but, in truth, trained most artfully to fall and float in a thousand wreaths of silky ringlets, over her neck and shoulders, and far below her waist, shrouding her as with a golden glory. But exquisite as were her features, they yet were nothing in comparison to her unrivalled symmetry of person—the plump and rounded neck wreathed to and fro with many a swanlike motion, the soft full arch of her superbly falling shoulders, the swell of the fair bosom, even now in her fresh girlhood luxuriant and mature, with myriads of fine azure veins meandering about its glowing surface—the slender waist scarcely confined by the slight silver zone that gathered in the folds of the white gauzy lawn that scarcely veiled her bust, leaving her shoulders and round dimpled arms all unencumbered; the wavy outlines of her form, indicated by the fall of the thick heavy drapery of azure silk that flowed from her waist downward, to the earth, suffering only the extremity of one small foot decked with a silver sandal to peep out modestly beneath the hem. Such was the foremost of the fair tenants o the room, who met the cold indignant eye of the young prisoner, as she leaned negligently on a pile of satin cushions, warbling the amatory air which had so shocked Teresa; not that there was any touch of grossness or indecency in the words, which, the more fatally seductive for that very want, breathed the full soul of passion blended with sentiment and pathos—but that the singer threw into every tone and accent a manner so voluptuous, an expression so entirely sensual, that, to an ear not yet corrupted into sin, the effect was painful and disgusting. The second damsel was a tall slender Persian, with the warm dusky hue of her country's complexion on her soft velvet skin, a soft rich flush peering out upon either cheek, like the first touch of young Aurora's pencil upon the waving night-clouds—her eyes, fringed by long silky lashes, dark, deep, and swimming, now melted into a sleepy languor, now flashed out with intolerable lustre—her hair, black as the raven's wing, was twisted into a mass of little spiral curls, and decked with chain work ornaments of gold, a glittering amulet all set with sapphires of rare price lying by either ear. Her dress, too, was no less dissimilar to that of her fair beauty, than was the style of her loveliness; yet, though no portion of her flesh was visible, except the face and hands and a small part of the throat, it yet displayed her person, scarcely in a less degree than did that of her companion which left her bosom, shoulders, and arms almost entirely bare. She wore a close cymar or jacket of bright yellow satin, all flowered with sprigs of gold, and buttoned up in front with studs of chrysolite; below the zone, she was clothed in loose trousers of gold-sprigged Indian muslin, with heavy golden bangles, allhung with glittering bells, about her ankles, and light gilded slippers on her small shapely feet. There was, perhaps, even more of beauty in the movements, in the exceeding grace, in the air, the manner of this oriental fair one, than in her personal charms, as she danced lightly to and fro, bending her slight shape into many a strange and graceful posture, waving her arms, whose every gesture was perfection, and swaying all her limbs with an exquisite freedom, her golden bells chiming the while in time to the words of the singer, and the tones of the lute or gittern which the third girl—a tall black-browed Italian—was striking with rare skill, uttering ever and anon one of those low-toned happy laughs, which should have told of an innocent heart at ease, but which, alas, announced no more than heartless levity. The tresses of the lute player, though black as the bright Persian's ringlets, were as different from them in their nature and disposition as things can be—even the most dissimilar—for they were parted evenly upon her forehead, and flowed down quite uncurled in long and wavy masses, actually resting in loose coils upon the velvet floor-cloth, as she sat near the English girl on a low ottoman, with her back to a great Venetian mirror, which reflected the contour of all her sloping shoulders down nearly to the waist. Such was the scene—such the companions— to which the buccaneer now introduced his captive. For a moment, so soft were the carpets of the armory, and so light had been the footsteps of the new comers—for a moment the girls continued their occupations, unconscious that they were overlooked by any mortal eye— but when, after a meaning pause of a second's space, and a threatening glance at Teresa, Ringwood advanced a step or two, the Persian dancer raised her head from one of her low bending attitudes, and catching sight of her stately lord, uttered a shrill cry of surprise, and bounded forward like an antelope to meet him; quick, however, as were her movements, she was nevertheless outstripped by the fair beauty, who, being seated nearer the door, sprang up the moment she heard the outcry of the other, and was in the embrace of the buccaneer with the speed of light, winding her beautiful bare arms about his noble person, pressing her panting bosom close to his mighty chest, and pouring a flood of sweet burning kisses on his brow, eyes, and mouth; uttering all the time a low soft murmur, all eloquent of eager passion, and blushing so profusely with excitement, that all her neck and bosom, seen clearly through the thin gauze of her boddice, were crimsoned by the torrent of hot blood, that coursed through every vein of her whole body like streams of burning lava. Nor was the pirate chieftain slow or reluctant to return her passionate caress, but clasped her in a long embrace. After a minute, however, he released her, reluctant as it seemed. And there amid those sirens, as beautiful as either, but, oh! how different in her calm, innocent, pure loveliness, scarce conscious of her own exquisite attractions, and all unsunned by any tinge of noonday passion, from their unmaidenly beauty, which actually pained the feelings though it might fix the eye and rivet the mere senses of the beholder, stood the sad Spanish maiden. At first she gazed in mute astonishment, unable to conceive the possibility of aught so boldly passionate as the blonde beauty's rapture—but gradually, as she felt her own heart bound too fiercely in her bosom, and her own pulses throb, she knew not wherefore, she let her eyes sink to the carpet, and stood all breathless and dismayed blushes and paleness chasing each other over her speaking lineaments, like the alternate lights and shadows which sweep in autumn days over some lovely landscape. The slave-girl all the time gazed with dilated eyes that seemed to drink in all that passed before them—without, however, comprehending anything; clinging with one hand to the velvet cloak which partly shrouded the form of her pale mistress, and trembling wildly between fear and admiration. When this strange scene had ended, Ringwood turned towards his prisoner, and taking her by the hand said, while a cold convulsive shudder shook her whole form— “These lovely girls, Teresa, shall be your future comrades—this bower of bliss shall be your dwelling. Pleasure shall wait your very wish; luxury, such as no human heart has ever dreamed of, shall lull you to your slumbers; not an air of heaven shall visit your brow too roughly; and your whole life shall glide away like one soft dream of rapture. Bella, my fair-haired beauty, welcome your new companion, choose her a boudoir near your own—fit her with garments such as your own rare taste may choose, and her rare beauty justify, and above all,” he added, lowering his voice to a tender whisper, “be not thou jealous, rare one; for if I seek to win her to my will, it is not anything for love, but all for vengeance! and now, farewell, sweet sirens all,” he added, speaking once more aloud, “and let me find you, my Teresa, happy as these fair creatures when I revisit you to-morrow.” “Oh no!” she cried, in vehement impetuous tones, that would not brook control even of reason, “oh no! no! no! Leave me not here, leave me not here, with these! No, better, better far to languish in the deepest dungeon; to writhe in untold agonies; to share the slenderest pittance of the most wretched innocent slave, than live in plenty thus, with wanton guilt and barefaced infamy for comrades! Slay me, then, slay me with agonies protracted, as you will, cast me forth to the beasts of the forest, tear my limbs joint from joint, but leave me not with these.” “Teresa,” he said, speaking in a low but distinct voice, with fearful emphasis, “Teresa, I have sworn, and you well know how deeply, and with how deep a cause! Now mark me, one thing I have remitted to you, in one thing have I pardoned; tempt me no further, I beseech you.” “O, slay me! slay me, rather”—she frantically interrupted him. “I will,” he said, “I will, by Heaven! if you say any more about it; but not as you suppose—I will, Teresa, I will cast you forth if you provoke me any further; but not to the wild beasts of the forest! By Him that lives! tigers and sharks are merciful compared with those to whom I will abandon you! Hark to that shout of revelry and riot! they shall enjoy the charms which you would keep so charily! in the rack of their barbarous embraces shall your frame writhe with anguish! by their hands shall your limbs be torn joint from joint! Three days I give you, but three days! to yield you wholly to my will; or beyond doubt it shall be done to you as I have spoken!” With an air of proud defiance, tossing her long black locks from her pale forehead, her bosom panting, and her eyes flashing as if with a prophetic inspiration, she raised her head, which had drooped on her bosom, and shook her finger, menacingly, at the great Rover. “And I tell thee,” she said, in clear and liquid tones—they were like the blast of a silver trumpet, “and I tell thee, that ere three days thou shalt be called to thine account—be it for good or evil!” “Then!” answered he, bursting into an uncontrollable fit of fury, “then! by my Marker! to thine shalt thou precede me!” and he made a step forward as if to seize her by the arm; when the Italian girl and the gay Persian dancer rushed between, and entangling him in their caresses, hung round his sinewy frame, like honeysuckles, wreathing their sweet tendrils about some giant oak; while at the same moment the fair-haired Bella laid her hand on the Spanish maiden's shoulder, with a delicate respectful pressure, and in a soft voice whispered blandly— “Oh! irritate him not! oh! irritate him not, dear lady—for although, when he is himself, none are more noble-hearted, none are more generous and kind, none are more gentle, yet when the paroxysm is upon him, he is the slave of fifty furious demons, his own unchained passions, to which the fiends themselves were powerless and tame! oh! irritate him not! and all may yet be well; and see, he smiles,” she added, quite disregarding the air of bitter scorn with which Teresa met her soft and disinterested advances; and casting herself in the way of the Rover with the conscious air of a favorite, she threw her arms about his neck, and stopped the words he seemed about to utter by a long ardent kiss, whispering in his ear as she did so, “Heed her not now, she will be tamer soon—consider she is but fresh caged; and even singing birds will dash themselves against the bars of their fresh cages, even although those bars be gilded!” and she uttered a low sweet merry laugh; which, though in truth both the action which preceded it, and the laugh itself, originated in the best and tenderest motives, struck upon the breast of Teresa as the height of cold unfeeling heartlessness. The Rover laughed as he returned the fair girl's kiss. “Well, be it so, beautiful Bella—be it so, if you will;” and then stooping down, he whispered a sentence in her ear. None heard it but she—and, pushing him gently to the door, cried, “Oh, yes! I will remember: and now go—Reginald, now go!” Nothing more was said for the moment; and, turning quietly away, the Rover left the room, closing the door behind him—releasing Teresa from the dread, which, when he rushed towards her, despite her dauntless courage, had shaken her every nerve. He had not, however, quitted the apartment a minute, before Bella again approached the maiden—an air of calm compassion sitting serenely on her lovely features; and laying her white hand, which showed like snow itself for the contrast, upon the darker complexion of Teresa's arm— “Come, lady, come with me,” she said, almost humbly. “Come to my private bower, and we will seek for some attire less unbecoming. With me you will be safe, and can take some repose, of which I judge it certain you must stand in need very greatly.” But the proud virgin shook off the caressing hand as if contamination had been in its slightest pressure, and shrank back from her consolation with an air of absolute horror. “Pray, shrink not from me thus,” the English girl exclaimed, in accents that told forcibly the depth of her emotions, her face again covered with a deep, deep blush, far different from the hot crimson color that had suffused her whole complexion at the words of her lover. “Nay, shrink not from me thus, dear lady: contamination lies not in the mere touch, even of the violet. It is the mind which, alone, pollutes; and God, he knows that, be I what I may myself, I would not teach vice to another—no! not to be virtuous again myself, which I can never be, nor pure as I once was. Nor yet too much despise us: for, be sure, lady, that as thou art now, we were all once; as innocent, as pure, as noble; and be not too sure, lady, proud though thou be, and as unsunned pure snow, and strong in purity—be not too sure that thou be not in a few days as we now are!” “Never—Oh no! by my own soul, no! never!” answered Teresa, eagerly, but in a manner much mollified by her companion's manner. “Be not too sure!” Bella responded. “Honor is dear, indeed—dearer than life to the innocent—but life is very sweet! and death, under the tortures, very awful; and if, by losing life, we may not save our honor—” “Then better die dishonored!”—Teresa interrupted her—“but though I hear your words I cannot comprehend their purport?” “Like enough, lady!—like enough! and may you never do so—but I believe you will! For you will learn that this same honor, for which you would die willingly, may be rent from you, living, by the brute violence, not of one noble-minded, although erring, soldier, but of a thousand brutal desperadoes—and that you may not die till all, even the loathsome blacks, are sated, and then die horribly—oh! horribly.—Better, perhaps, comply, than suffer thus.” “Besides,” continued the other, as if she had scarcely heard the Spanish maiden's words —“Besides, if he so will it, without force he can win you. No man's arm, and no woman's heart ever successfully opposed, when he was resolute in earnest—the fixed and overwhelming will of Reginald. Lady, before three days, if he so will it, you shall dote on him unto adoration.” “You know not what you say,” answered the Spaniard firmly, but no longer with any vehemence of passion in her tone. “I love another.” “Ha! is it so?” replied Bella “Is it so? then indeed, it may be, you shall not fall: for had I loved another then, as I love now, surely I had endured all sooner!” “And do you then—do you in truth love this dread being?” said Teresa, strong interest overpowing the disgust which she had felt to her frail companion. “Do you indeed love— you, who seem so soft and gentle—this merciless, this fiend-like Rover?” “For what then do you take me?” exclaimed Bella, looking full in the eyes of Teresa, with as proud and haughty an air as she had lately met, “with all my mind, and heart, and spirit!—think you an English lady, though she may stoop for love to be a Pirate's leman, would feign love which she felt not? With my whole mind, and heart, and spirit, I worship, I adore him! In his love—in his life— I alone have my being—when he dies I shall not survive him!—it is enough—trust to me; you have naught to fear—neither harm to your person, nor pollution to your mind—come to my hower, and I will speak with you more fully.” The Spanish girl, who for a moment, dignified as she was, and proud and haughty, had actually quailed before the fiery and surpassing pride of the pirate's paramour, now feeling perhaps that she had something wronged her in her thoughts, and at all events experiencing a melting of the heart towards one who, al though frail, was kind to her and very gentle, and who might have some palliation of her crime in the peculiar circumstances of her sad tale, answered no further, but took her proffered hand in silence, and leaning on her shoulder, for she was fast becoming very weak, retired to the beauty's boudoir. CHAPTER X. The day passed over, as all days must, in its appointed time, whether of joy or sorrow, and the great sun went down upon the pirate's hold, as peacefully as on the shepherd's hut, all bright and blessing, and one by one the stars came out in their set places, and the broad moon arose—a ball of liquid silver. The day passed over—but through its weary hours, though trembling at each distant footstep, and shuddering at every voice, Teresa heard no more, saw no more, of the dreaded Rover; and as she learned by slow degrees to forget—if not to forgive—the frailty of her lovely hostess in her compassionate kindness; and as hour after hour glided by, and naught occurred to wake new apprehension, the tension of her nerves, strong preternaturally by the intense and terrible excitement of the scenes in which she had so lately borne a part so prominent, was gradually softened down; her tears flowed, not convulsively, but in a tranquil stream which ever seemed to relieve her burning brain from one half of its fiery burden —she now wept not for herself alone—and even that rather from nervous agitation, than that she had appreciated her position—but for her tortured, butchered brother—for her unhappy parent—for, more than all beside—her true, her own dear Amadis! Nor did she only weep!—she prayed—prayed purely, fervently, with strong affectionate unwavering faith, for strength—that only real strength—the strength which cometh from on high—to bear in calm humility, in Christian fortitude, whatever might be sent to her by Him, who sendeth all his gifts, whether of joy or sorrow, wisely and well, and—though we, thoughtless and hardhearted, believe it not to be so—for our eternal good! She prayed—and rose up from her bended knees—as all will rise who do pray fervently, and purely, and with faith—refreshed and comforted in spirit, and strengthened with an inward hope, surpassing any confidence of earth, in a strong Rescuer on high. She rose up, braver than she had knelt down, and with a better courage; for it was not based on her own vain confidence of heart, and stubborn purpose, but in the love of Him who slumbereth not, nor sleepeth, nor overlooketh the least hair that is rent from the head of his most humble worshipper. She rose up, as we have said, comforted and strengthened—she washed, and braided her disordered locks, and clad herself in the most modest garments of her fair entertainer; she ate and drank, and laid her down in her pure unsunned innocence, beside that bright hut erring being, whose very virtues had been melted down by the uncurbed indulgence of-ungovernable passions, into voluptuous vice, and slept as soundly and as sweetly as the young happy infant cradled upon its mother's bosom. While long, long after she had sunk to rest, the fair-haired beauty watched every long drawn breath, and almost wept, she knew not why, over the calm unconscious sleeper— till when the night had far advanced towards morning, she started, as if into remembrance, from a sudden dream; and rising from Teresa's side, thrust her small snowy feet into a pair of fairy slippers, drew a large robe of velvet about her shapely limbs, and stole away, nor returned any more to her own bower, until the tropical sun was high already in the clear firmament. That day the Rover came not nigh Teresa, for in the fort without, and in the circular basin, all was now bustle and hot haste. During the night two more feluccas, which had been detached from the rest upon some distant cruise, had been warped into the harbor and found berths beside their consorts, and all the morning long all hands were actively employed refitting them for instant service—water casks were rolled out, and filled, and hoisted in again; and biscuit, and rich meats, and fragrant wines, and arms, and ammunition, and fresh men, embarked with emulous haste. At noon, as the two girls might see from Bella's bower— for having, though half reluctant, and half doubtful of her own liberty to do so, become in some degree conciliated to that kind although guilty creature, Teresa would no more consent to quit her private chamber; nor to seek any more intercourse with those who, although in truth no more guilty than the English girl, yet seemed so to her eyes, already influenced— alas! weak mortals!—by some small show of kindness; at noon as the two girls might see from Bella's bower, a council was held within the ramparts of the keep of all the pirate leaders; and shortly after the drum beat to arms, and all the buccaneers assembled, and fell into their ranks, a gay and gorgeous host, numbering at least twelve hundred practised warriors. After a brief inspection by the great buccaneer himself, eight hundred were detailed, and instantly embarked in the two last arrived feluccas, and all the vessels of the other squadron, saving alone the largest bark—Ringwood's own flagship—and the small sloop or tender which lay moored by the water-gate. Within an hour at furthest, the last of this gallant squadron, detached, as it was evident, on some peculiar duty, disappeared behind a dense mass of trees which veiled the outlet of the harbor; and so strong was the current of the river which leaped up there at once, a giant from its birth, that in less than two hours more, they were well out to sea, with their sails set to the stiff breeze, ploughing the billows merrily. With them, however, we go not on their path of rapine—their sails were spread, and their masts bent to the morning blast, and their lean bows cleft with a sound of laughter the blue waves. But no eye from the pirate's hold could mark them, though many a heart beat eager with anticipation. When they were out of sight, after some short parade and manning of the guns, Ringwood dismissed his men; and with his arms folded upon his bosom, and his proud head depressed as though in melancholy thought, strolled for some time in a listless mood about the esplanade of the fort, and then withdrew quietly to his own turret chamber, where none—not his most intimate associates —not his most trusted officers—ever presumed to break upon his solitude; and there remained all moody and alone, till the sun had already plunged his lower limb into the deep and tufted foliage of the surrounding forest. Just at that time, however, as the land-breeze began to die away, and a faint languid calm succeeded, before the setting in of the fresher breath of the free ocean—a dull, deep, heavy sound—a sort of rumbling and continuous roar was heard by the watchers on the bastions; and while they were yet wondering what those hoarse notes might mean, the Rover stood among them— “Ordnance!” he cried—“and heavy ordnance!—man all the batteries, load, and run out the guns; see you have linstocks ready, and fire at hand to light them.” And, although many doubted that those far sounds were indeed guns—none disobeyed his orders; none hesitated for a moment—and ere long it was proved how perfect was the ear, how accurate the judgment of the great English Rover—for as the sea breeze freshened, and blew strong, it bore upon its dewy breath the sharp reports of many a single cannon, of many a long continuous volley. At last the sounds died off, and seemed to melt into the distance, and pass entirely away—but again, just as it grew quite dark, before the moon had risen, or the stars yet come out, the cannonading was renewed, closer, as it seemed, than before; and after a brief furious battle, a crimson glare rushed up the deep blue sky; and so continued, wavering now—now flashing fiery bright, for nigh an hour of time; then a keen stream, or column rather, of white light shot up towards the zenith with a dull heavy shock; a shower of sparks fell seaward, and all was dark and silent. All that night long torches were blazing, and guards pacing the stone bastions, and blue lights dimly burning in all the trenches of the outer works. Nay, more, the guns were manned even in the citadel itself, and in the Rover's keep—and all those tedious hours with ear, heart, eye on the alert, Teresa watched and prayed in the strong hope of coming succor. Both vessels in the harbor were full manned, and all in battle order—but, though all hearts were burning, all arms high strung against the foe, though Reginald himself waked to devise means of desperate defence, half doubting that his consorts were cut off, and two-thirds of his men destroyed, for well he knew no one would yield him captive —no foe appeared—nor friend. The chirpings and hummings of the innumerable insect tribes —the croak of the countless reptiles, mixed with the chatter of the night-hawk and the rich melody of an occasional mocking-bird, were the only sounds that waked the night echoes of the Florida forest, except the watchword and the tramp of the stern sentinel. Just as day dawned, commanding the small sloop to slip her cable, and with a picked and veteran crew of twenty English sailors, to drop down cautiously and reconnoitre, Ringwood departed from the busy ramparts; and, for the first time since the stormy scene which had ensued on Teresa's introduction, turned towards the bower. He lingered not, however, there; when he found none within its gorgeous precincts, save the Italian girl and the soft Persian dancer, though each tried her choicest allurements to detain him; but passed, after a few short moments, into the bower of his English favorite. “Ha! Bella,” he said, as he entered, “my sweet Bella,” and a touch of real fondness was audible in its rich accents—“and thou, Teresa, nay! nay! start not, nor look so wildly, lady—I come not to alarm, much less to harm you; sit, fair one, and fear nothing. Now, Bella, dearest, I have watched all night long, and am fatigued and faint, bid your slave girls bring forth their dainties, I come to break my fast in your sweet company, and spend a tranquil hour,” and with the words he cast his splendid figure at length upon a satin ottoman on the side of the chamber furthest from Teresa, in an attitude of the most perfect grace and majesty, and remained for some seconds without speaking, a grave and even sorrowful expression prevading his expressive lineaments. After a few moments, raising his eyes to Teresa's face, he perceived that the blank air of dismay, almost despair, still sat upon her pallid features; and that with lips apart, nostrils dilated, and eyes rigidly set and glaring, she gazed upon his features as if she therein thought to read her doom. “Fear nothing now from me,” he again said, in a voice singularly mild and witching. “Fear nothing now from me, Teresa. The fire has gone out here,” and he laid his broad hand on his brow, “and if you fan it not by any heedless folly, will sleep, perchance, for ever. The fiend of memory is for a while at rest; see that you wake it not to phrensy! nay, wonder not, nor start at my words, either. If I have sinned much I have suffered much, and many of my sins have been the rank fruit of those very sufferings. But a truce now to this; my word is pledged to you, that you shall undergo no violence. My word, girl, inviolate yet—see that you stir me not to any reckless fit—when reason yields the reins to memory, to weakness, and revenge! Teresa, fear me not!” “I fear you not,” she answered, half timidly, half reassured by his strangely altered manner, “though I have mighty cause to fear you, yet I do not!” “So you shall have no cause—daring myself, I love the daring and undaunted, even when they defy me! sin-stained myself and passion-blighted, I yet admire the innocent and pure. Dauntless I do know you, Teresa!—for had you not been so, long hence had your dishonored carcase glutted the dog-fish and the shark, and pure I do believe you! Were it not, I say, for memory and pride, I might even now release you.” “Oh! do! do!” she exclaimed, “do so; and God will bless you; your sins, though red as scarlet, shall become white as snow; your rapines and your crimes shall all be pardoned you; a grateful virgin's prayers shall rise up nightly for your weal, shall win the grace of the Eternal, shall shield your head in battle, that not a hair of it shall perish, and more, far more, than with a self-approving conscience, shall crown your days with bliss, and steep your nights in quiet. Do so, and on your bed of death a weak girl's voice of gratitude shall smoothe your thorny pillow—her father's—” “Ha!—no more!—Peace on your life, no more!” cried Ringwood, fiercely interrupting her, as he half started from the couch whereon he was reclining, at the mere mention of the man whom he indeed had so deep cause to execrate; though but a little while before he had seemed on the point of yielding to her prayers. Teresa, nerved with the hope of winning him, would have replied; and by so doing would probably have once more roused him into a burst of savage and ungovernable fury, but as her lips moved to answer, Bella, who had been absent for a moment with her handmaids, fortunately returned, and laying her hand on Teresa's shoulder, pressed it so strongly, that she looked up, and then she laid her fingers to her own mouth with a grave smile, and changed the subject by addressing Ringwood with some slight question of no moment. Meantime the board was opened with dainties, choice fruits, and savory meats, and snowy bread, and the enchanting wines of Southern Europe, in bowls of porcelain and crystal, dishes embossed with gold, and flasks engraved by the unequalled chisel of Cellini and Ringwood led, strange guests! the fair-haired Bella, and that stern innocent Spanish virgin, to seats beside him; and played the host with such unrivalled courtesy, such proud humility in every accent of his rich, deep, manly voice, such dignity and grace in every free unstudied gesture, that even Teresa was won for a space from her gloomy abstraction, and to her own astonishment—when she reflected on it afterwards—found herself wondering at—almost admiring—the chivalric and dignified demeanor of the fierce pirate. Before the meal was concluded, one of the slave girls who attended, came with a hasty step from the armory, announcing that Pluto and another black awaited the Rover's leisure. “What other black—my midnight beauty?” exclaimed the Rover, laughing, “His fellow Charon, is it?” “His name Antonio, massa—who sell us fruit and fish from his pirogue.” “Ha!” cried the Rover, “Ha!—” and mused a moment, and stepped out into the gorgeous vestibule, decked with its glittering arms, leaving the door behind him open, so that the girls could hear every word that passed. “What! is it you, Antonio—what brings you here, and whence?” “From Key West, massa, last, with plenty fine fresh turtle—they in the pirogue, down below, so heavy we can't warp him up!” “Key West—what of our squadron then? you must have met it?” “Certain!” replied the negro, “I met 'em, and told massa Cunninghame of Spanish fleet in the offing—seven merchant galliots and one caravel! Then massa Cunninghame set sail till he fell in with them, and hoisted English color, and then ran!” “Ran?” cried the Rover, “ran?” “Yes, he ran, massa Ringwood, till they all chased him, and got scattered, then he turned round and fought; and when the caravel took ground not fifty fathom from the inlet, he left her hard and fast, and chased the galliots, and took two; and then his squadron all came back, and battered the war-ship and burned her quite, and sacked the galliots, and then scuttled them, and then went off in chase again after five others: long chase, but still I guess he catch 'em!” “Ha! well done, Cunninghame! brave Cunninghame! brave Cunninghame!” exclaimed the Rover, “take that for thy news, fellow,” giving him as he spoke two or three Spanish dollars. “I must away and call the men from the felucca and the batteries; they list not service unless it be strictly needed. What wouldst thou more, my good fellow?” “So please you, send four hands in his canoe, help poor Antonio up with big pirogue; have plenty fat turtle and fresh fruit to-night.” “Well, see to it, Pluto!” and with the words entirely deceived by the intelligence he had received, and lulled into confidence that his crews were victorious, the Rover hurried down, and called off all his men save the two wonted sentinels upon the bastions, and the two watchmen in his own felucca; revoked his orders to the sloop which had already moved towards the outlet; and ordering an extra supply of wines, in compensation of their recent toils, to all the buccaneers, gave himself up to dreams of complete triumph. An hour or two elapsed, and Antonio's pirogue came up, manned in addition to its usual crew by four of the Rover's trustiest men, who reported all still and peaceful in the outlet, and was moored inside the large felucca, close by the shingly beach below the batteries. Her deck load of fruit and fish was soon got ashore, her hatches battened down, and herself, as it seemed, left vacant and unguarded, while her black crew, consisting only of two boys in addition to Antonio, went ashore with the Rover's men to join in their accustomed revellings and riots. Night fell; and though for a little while licentious songs, loud shouts of mirthful laughter, and many a sound of wild ungoverned mirth rang through the guarded esplanade, long before midnight not an eye was awake in the ships, on the ramparts, in the dwellings, or in the Rover's keep, so heavily were the buccaneers exhausted by the strange mixture of fatigue and feasting which had characterized the last four days—save those of the four sentinels, two in the barque and one on either bastion, and of the sad Teresa, who, waking from a perturbed and dreamy sleep, had missed her fair companion—for she, as on the former night, had stolen from her couch unnoticed— and now stood gazing from her high lattice over the lovely scene below, which lay all glimmering out in the indistinct light of the happy moon, half lustre and half shadow. CHAPTER XI. As she gazed down upon the moonlit esplanade, Teresa saw a tall dark figure creep out with cat-like stealthy tread from beneath the verandah of the large building nearest to the sea; and, keeping itself with great care inside the darkest shadows, drag itself inch by inch towards the stone bastion at the right hand termination of the battery; whereon she clearly saw the pirate sentinel stalking his solitary round upon the rampart, the long bright barrel of his shouldered arquebuse glancing like silver in the moonlight. At first she gazed with simple wonder, wholly unmixed with curiosity or interest, upon the movements of the dark shadowy form; but suddenly, as he crossed a streak of moonshine, it struck her with the speed of light that this was a well known figure; and instantly a train of recollections, all hitherto forgotten, flashed on her—the name Antonio—the voice now well-remembered of the unseen messenger—it was—it must be! the black fisherman, the trusted guide and hunter of her loved Amadis! She now strained all her eyes, her heart, her spirit, to mark what was his progress, not doubting for a moment that ere long she would be set free, whether by death or rescue. While she had been engaged, brief as they were, in these imaginations, she had lost sight for a moment or two of the dark gliding figure; and when she turned her eyes again towards the spot, it was no longer visible; and, what seemed stranger yet, the pirate sentinel no longer paced the bastion, although his comrade could be distinctly seen leaning against an angle near the sallyport, by which Teresa had gained entrance, at the further end of the lines. Suspecting, more than ever, now that something great was on the point of happening, she gazed yet more intently; yet nothing might she see of him, whom she believed, with all the confidence of youth and inexperience, to be a friend and rescuer within the pirate's hold. Tired at length with watching the long line of vacant ramparts, she looked again towards the sleeping soldier, and as she did so, from the dark shadow of the ravelin and trench she saw a coal-black figure leap, with the blithe and muscular action of a tiger bounding upon his prey, on the unconscious pirate—something bright flashed once or twice aloft in the clear moonshine, and the struggle was ended in a moment, the hapless sentinel falling a scarce less conscious victim to his swift secret foe. A moment more, and the victor had donned the scarlet watch cloak of his fallen enemy, and was now boldly traversing the whole line of the esplanade, stopping and stooping down for a moment or two at regular intervals, while a faint clinking sound, heard indistinctly from the distance, gave note, even to the inexperienced ear of Teresa, that he was engaged in spiking all the cannon. After this task was ended, disencumbering himself of the watch cloak, he crept down to the water's edge, and plunging into the calm basin swan straight for his pirogue, swung himself by a rope to the deck, and for several minutes' space was lost to the anxious gaze of the Spanish maiden. He re-appeared at last, however, from the hold, accompanied by ten or twelve men, whom by their corslets and steel caps, and the long barrels of their Spanish muskets, she knew at once to be Castilian soldiers—within a moment they had lowered away the pinnace, which hung at the pirogue's stern, and entering it, pulled openly across the basin towards the Rover's barque; the sentinels on which, seeing that their boat came directly as it appeared to them from the water-gate of the fortress, hailed not, nor uttered any challenge, but suffered the pinnace to come to under her very stern, and her crew to scale her bulwark unopposed; all of which Teresa might behold distinctly by clear moonlight. What further passed she knew not; but in a little while she saw a bright light shown from the windows in the stern, and at the same time the vessel began to swing round slowly so as to bring her broadside, which had so lately borne full on the entrance of the basin, to cover the dwellings of the buccaneers. For a little while longer she watched steadfastly the basin and the vessels, but nothing took place any more, although she stayed beside the lattice till the moon set behind the treetops, and deep darkness settled down over the glimmering prospect. Then fancying that nothing would take place that night, and fearing lest Bella might return and find her watching, she turned away and walked towards her couch. In doing so, however, she passed another casement, which looked out towards the forest in the rear; on which side, fearless of any sudden onslaught, and confiding in the remoteness of their station, surrounded as it was by forests, everglades, impenetrable hammocks, and morasses—pathless save to the wandering Indian—the pirates kept no watch; and, as she passed it, another sight flashed on her eyes, even more wonderful as it appeared to her, than aught she had yet witnessed—a long and regular line of dull red sparks, not larger than the luminous firefly of that region, and scarce so brilliant, were winding round the outer side of the ditch, which circled all the rear of the position. Suddenly, at one point they clustered close together, and then descended, as it seemed, into the deep wet fosse. Then! then! her very soul on the alert, for she had seen and heard enough of warfare to know that those dull sparks were kindled matches of a long line of musqueteers, she threw the lattice open; and leaning out into the dewy night air, listened intently—nor did she listen long, before the grating of a saw was clearly audible, although by no means loud enough to wake a sleeper; or scarce, perhaps, to rouse the dull perceptions of an uninterested watcher—after a time the sound was heard no more, and very soon the little lights might be seen, one by one, emerging from the hither side, and forming in close order within the esplanade, which they had actually entered all unmolested and unseen, save by a friendly eye—and now Teresa knew that friends were close at hand, and rescue almost certain. Yet now she trembled more than in her hour of peril, and was so shaken in her every nerve, that when she kneeled to pray and offer up her tribute of thanksgiving, her tongue refused its office, her senses failed her, and she sank fainting on the velvet carpet, so that she saw, rest as she might, or any other, who had gazed seaward from the height, almost at the same point of time wherein the footmen passed the palisades, the tall white sails of a huge Spanish caravella, steal ghost-like through the shadows of the trees that fringed the outlet, towed by a dozen boats pulled noiselessly with muffled oars, into the middle of the basin. Another—and another—and yet another followed; and, strange to tell! though no slight noise attended their proceedings, they, with the captured barque of Ringwood, were moored within half pistol shot of the batteries, the guns of which were all, as has been seen, spiked and so rendered useless, their cannon bearing full on the defenceless dwellings of the buccaneers, and their boats ready to land with their armed crews at a moment's notice, ere any ear had taken note of their arrival. In another part of the Rover's keep, while all this was in progress, even to the point of time wherein Teresa fainted, there was a widely different picture, had any eye been there to look upon it. It was the very topmost turret of that tall building—a small octagonal watch tower, overlooking the whole esplanade below, and having the breech of the huge gun, which has before been mentioned, within six feet of its doorway, which opened on the battlements. Access was only gained to this high turret by a steep winding stairway from the large armory below; and on the platform, at the stair head, so that no living thing could pass it without awakening them, were stretched on a soft rug full armed for instant battle, the two gigantic negroes. This was the Rover's den, his last stronghold, his chosen privacy. Lighted by day through eight tall pointed windows, now muffled all by blinds of Indian matting; and in the night by a large brazen lamp, with four bright burners, it was as light as life, though silent as the grave. It was the plainest, nay, the only plain chamber of that superb and gorgeous building; its floor and walls being covered equally with the soft seats woven by Indian girls, from the sweet aromatic seeds and spicy grasses of that region—its furniture, two or three camp stools of dark English oak, a centre table of the same fabric, covered with maps and plans of battle or the like, a silver standish and a tall golden crucifix—and another large broad slab of some Indian wood, littered with charts and papers, instruments of astronomy and navigation, pistols and dirks, and articles of clothing (such as fringed gloves and feathered hats), and one or two tall wine flasks, with a Venetian drinking glass of scarce inferior height. Upon the walls hung many suits of armor, with fire-arms of rare and choice construction, and swords of exquisite device and manufacture. The only other article of furniture, and that perhaps the most important in the chamber, was a large low bedstead of oak, with a plain cotton mattress, and white draperies of simple linen—and on that lowly bed reclined, in deep though troubled slumber, the mighty frame of the great English buccaneer, with his fair favorite by his side, sleeping as calmly as a summer's night upon a breezeless river. Her rich redundant curls fell off in loose and wavy masses from her fair brow, floating across the massive chest and muscular shoulders of the buccaneer, on which that brow was pillowed; her eyes were closed, but the long fringe which curtained them was pencilled in distinct relief against her clear complexion—the whole expression of her face, as she slept, was exquisitely pure and child-like, and the soft smile which nestled in the twin dimples of her rosy mouth, seemed born of innocence and tranquil bliss. So was it not with her companion. Dark frowns and gloomy shadows chased one another fast and thick over his broad expressive features—the sweat stood in full bubbles on his turbulent brow—a fierce sarcastic smile now writhed his pallid lips, and now he laughed almost aloud, but with a scornful and self-mocking laughter, such as the fiends might use, jeering at stainless virtue. His great chest heaved and fell, not with the regular pulsations of healthful innocent sleep, but with convulsive pants and throbbings—his arms were dashed violently to and fro, with the hands clenched like iron—such were the night dreams of the Rover, and fearful as they must needs have been, to judge by their effect, as fearfully were they dispelled. A clear sharp ringing sound as of a musket shot close to the inmost keep, rang through the night air—one of the Indian allies of Don Amadis having unconsciously discharged his arquebuse, and so called down discovery—little, however, if at all premature— on the attacking party. Upon the instant, though the fair being by his side yet slumbered all unconscious of alarm, Reginald Ringwood sprang to his feet, fully awake, and in the clearest mastery of his senses—one bound, he stood upon the platform of the keep, and in less time than it would have taken any other man to mark one portion of the perils that environed him, he had envisaged all; and seen the only hope that was left to him. The invaders as yet knew not, it would seem, whether they were discovered, and rested yet upon their arms; and Ringwood seeing clearly that the exterior works were all untenable already, and knowing that his only hope of making good the citadel itself, depended on his getting men to man his guns from the great barracks, resolved to turn this brief inaction to advantage. Before the very blacks had roused them from their slumbers, he had sprung to the breech of the huge cannon, had wheeled it round upon its pivot—Herculean task for any single arm, how puissant it might be soever!— had pointed it upon the nearest longest caravel, and, lighting a match instantly from the lamp in his turret, had discharged it on the foe. A broad bright glare shot out into the bosom of the night, a cloud of snowy volume was driven before it, and a roar, like that of twenty thunder claps, shook the strong tower to its base, and deafened for an inftant every ear that heard it. Before its echoes had subsided, before the Spaniards, in turn surprised (for the huge missile striking the great caravel amid-ships, had cut her mainmast by the board, carrying with it the mizen), had poured in their answering broadside, the Rover's bugle wound clear and lustily, the signal of recall was heard by the awakened pirates, who rushed half-dressed, their weapons in their hands, from the rear of the buildings, to obey his signal. The instant he had fired the cannon, a dozen stalwart blacks, Pluto and Charon at their head, the garrison of this keep, stood on the platform at his side, heavily armed and ready. Dressing himself the while he spake, he thundered forth his orders with strange rapidity and wonderful precision— “Pluto and Charon, away both of ye, down to the southern sallyport, unbar it on the instant, holding it well in hand the while, to admit our fellows from the barrack; but see ye let not the Spaniards enter! You others, quick there, quick! load the great culverin, and run it out again; see that you keep the level—so, well done, lads; now fire!” and with the words again forth burst the stunning roar. “So, cheerily, brave hearts; fight it thus till the great caravel go down, then wheel it on the next, and sink her likewise! I go to man the inner ramparts. Ha! Bella, my sweet girl,” he cried, as she came forth in disarray—“down to your bower, my girl, and dight you! 'Fore God, but I believe our time is come already!” And with the word he darted down the stairway, and reached the sally-port just as the buccaneers, half naked, scattered, and dismayed, began to pour in from the esplanade. But few and faint, they came all breathless, many wounded, and some to drop down dead the instant they had forced their entry; for, in a moment after the Rover's unexpected shot, the Spanish crews had started to their guns, and five broadsides of very heavy metal were poured into the clustered buildings of the pirates, before they were yet well afoot, so that the carnage was tremendous; then, when they had rushed out, Don Amadis wheeled his two hundred musketeers into a line upon their flank, poured in a shattering volley upon their scattered masses, and then charged, sword in hand, with his Castilian troopers, and all his Indian volunteers. Darkness alone saved any from destruction, and it was out of four hundred soldiers, for so many alone had remained in the lines, scarcely a hundred sound men entered, with perhaps fifty more, wounded and wholly useless; not force, in short, enough to man the guns, even at the rate of one man to a cannon. Still this mere handful was disposed, by the wondrous genius of the Rover, with such rare tact and skill, manning such guns alone as were most useful, that until day-break he was enabled not merely to repel the attacking parties, but to beat them quite back from his lines with fearful slaughter. Three times he rallied, and each time brought back his every man unharmed; leaving the ground which he had traversed piled high with carcases, and reeking with hot gore. Meantime the black crew on the keep plied the long culverin with unabated zeal; its every bullet plunging into the castled sides of the tall Spanish caravellas—but not for that did they abate their murderous and well sustained cannonading against the pirate barracks, until not a stick or stone of them stood upright to cover any foeman. Then, but not until then, did they direct their fire on the keep; and even then so distant was it from their guns, and at an elevation so considerable, that their fire did it but small damage, while, all the time, they suffered heavily. Meantime, the armed boats of the squadron landed; and their crews formed instantly a junction with the land forces, led by Amadis Ferrajo; which, by the dint of energy and zeal almost unparalleled, had forced their way through tangled brakes and shaking quagmires, over broad lakes and navigable rivers, to that impregnable stronghold, as it was ever deemed by the too confident and careless Rover. Tremendous was the fate of every living being who met the onslaught of the infuriate Spaniards. No quarter was shown—none! neither to age nor sex—to innocence nor beauty! Hundreds of miserable children were tossed upon the spear-heads of the pitiless avengers; hundreds of women shot, or cut down, or spared only to glut for a brief space the fierce lust of their captors. When the day dawned, woman nor child survived; and not a groan was heard from the red slope—red with their smoking gore! Day dawned; and as the light grew clear, 4 the weakness of the defenders was discovered; and the assailants, forming in six columns, each column equal to the whole force under Ringwood, rushed desperate to win the ramparts. The guns were necessarily silent after the first discharge, for it was needful now that each man should fight hand to hand, or let the lines be carried! And they were carried in ten minutes! for though the buccaneers fought like incarnate devils, though Ringwood bore a charmed life, setting it fifty times upon a die and still unwounded, man after man was piked or cut down by his side, until the two blacks alone, with four or five English pirates, were left alive, and able to wield weapons. “In with you, Pluto and Charon—into the keep and hold the gate in hand—now! Anson, Falconer, ha! Gambier, too, and Drake, one charge more on these dogs of Spain—one for St. George and England!” And with the words, the five men dashed upon a column, headed by Amadis Ferrajo, of full two hundred veterans, rushing in with their levelled pikes, by the great gate which they had stormed—three men went down at three strokes of the Rover; and his last troopers seconded him like men, and gallant ones, if guilty!—the column wavered; but Amadis rallied it instantly with words of fire, and charged resistless! one by one down went Ringwood's men, pierced each with fifty wounds, each fighting till he fell “for England! merry England!” The Rover stood alone—but what recked he of that? he crossed swords with Don Amadis, beat down his guard, dealt him a blow that would have stretched him lifeless on the plain, but that his rapier shivered to the grasp—shot two men with his pistols, seized a third round his waist, who would have stopped him, and hurled him to the earth, so that the blood gushed from ears, eyes, and mouth, and he stirred hand no more; rushed through the castle gate, and ere its bars were fast behind him, stood in the presence of Teresa, all grim and gory, but unwounded. CHAPTER XII. For a moment or two the wretched girl gazed in pale terror on the dread apparition which stood before her; nor would it indeed have been easy to imagine one more terrible. His gorgeous dress was all begrimed with the black smoke of gunpowder, and dashed with frequent flakes of human gore; his face and hands were crimson; and, more than all, in his wild eye there was a gleam of terrible fire that could be compared to nothing but the glare of some dread fiend caught from the penal flames of his eternal prison house. She had risen from her knees on his entrance, for during the whole din and clamor of the desperate assault, her silvery tones had mounted to the throne of grace in pure and constant supplication; she stood staring at his distorted, furious features, speechless with terror and despair; but when he rushed towards her, and seized her delicate arm in his strong grasp, she sent forth a long, fluttering, thrilling shriek, so awfully acute and shrill, that pealing far above the blended roar of musketry and cannon, above the shouts and yells of the assailants, above the clang of axes plied fast and furiously against the portal of the keep, it reached the ears of the besiegers, and lent new vigor to their arms, new fire to their hearts. Yet, though the gate was crashing even now, and wavering beneath their blows, yet had their aid come all too late—for he had seized her round the waist, despite her feeble struggles, despite her pitiful supplications, lifted her from the ground and flung her by main force upon a velvet ottoman, with all her raven hair dishevelled, the braids which bound it having burst, and all her garments ruffled and in the last disorder from the hot struggle. He paused one second in his barbarous pastime, and profiting by that brief interval, all out of breath and panting as she was: “Your word!” she cried, “your word—your plighted oath of honor! never to do me wrong!” A bitter sneering laugh burst from his lips. “My word!” he said, “my word—a pirate's plighted word!—a robber's oath of honor!— ha, ha! you jest, Teresa; ha, ha! you would be merry—hark,” he continued, as the dread sounds of the assault rang nearer and more near. “Hark! to the blows!—the steps—the voices of your friends! There rings the full shout of your cursed sire—the war cry of the Des Aviles; there the fierce note of Amadis Ferrajo! Close! close at hand, fair lady!— close enough, almost, to preserve you! Ten minutes more, and they shall find you here, but their arms shall not clasp you to their hearts—father's nor lover's. No! no! I tell you no! Nor their lips press your brow; for you shall be a thing blighted, dishonored, foul! Vengeance! ho, vengeance! vengeance on Melendez,” and with the words he again caught her in his arms; and in a moment more his horrid purpose had been too well accomplished; but while she shrieked and struggled, as impotently, it is true, as the small bird in the talons of the merciless falcon, but still with all her power, the fair haired English beauty rushed, hardly less disarrayed than the Spanish maiden, into the room; and close behind, both her comrades, screaming for present aid to Ringwood, and fearful was their need! For, seeing now that every hope of protracting the defence was over, and that the enraged Spaniards were forcing their passage foot by foot, the brutal negroes, who had manned the great gun on the platform of the keep, and fought it until now, right dauntlessly, had left their post as desperate; and drunk with bloodshed and despair, maddened with liquor and with lust, had turned their fierce and brutal passions from their natural enemies, against the favorite beauties of their leader. But better had it been for them had they awaited the avenging Spaniard; better had they rushed into the den of the cub-drawn tigress, than thus have roused the fury of their chief. Leaving Teresa pale and breathless, and too terrified to thank God for her near escape, he rushed upon the mutineers—the first he caught about the middle, for he had no offensive arms—his sword having been broken in the conflict, and all his pistols emptied!— and hurled him headlong through the window, like an enormous missile shot from some giant catapult. The strong brocaded awnings opposed his passage; but with such mighty impulse was he sent, that the tough velvet was rent through and through, as though it had been gossamer—and the huge buccaneer was seen one instant sprawling and writhing in mid air with a terrifie sound of blended screams and curses on his tongue, before he fell upon the lifted pikes of the besiegers. Quelled for a moment by this awful spectacle, the other negroes stood aghast, and Ringwood, leaping upon them with the bound of an angry tiger, snatched his own weapon from the first, and whirling it about his head, clove him with one blow to the jaws. “Ha! dogs!” he shouted, in tones trumpet-like and clear, “ha! villains! dare ye dispute my will—or look too boldly on my prizes?—down to your kennels, dogs! down to the dungeon gate, and fight it to the last, with these accursed Spaniards! Down to the gate, I say, and if ye must, of your low nature, perish brutes, see that, at least, ye perish brave ones!” Not a word more was spoken, nor a blow stricken, but all cowed and abashed, the mutineers rushed down the sounding stairway, and, ere a moment passed, might be heard battling hand to hand with the fierce veterans of Melendez, who had already forced the gates, and were now rushing in, like a flood tide, resistless. Just at this juncture, by the other door, Pluto and Charon, the trusty guardsmen of the Rover, entered the harem, bleeding both from several recent wounds, but still bold and undaunted. “Ha! all is lost, then,” exclaimed the Rover, as they entered. “Is all lost, Charon?” “All is lost,” answered the faithful black, “all is lost! carried! postern gate carried too! enemy in the hall, will be here presently!” “And ye—what would ye?” cried the great English pirate, still calm in his extremity and fearless—“what would ye—fly?” “Will massa,” answered the negroes in one breath, “fly with massa Ringwood by covered way into the forest—or if he will, die here, with him.” “Ha! by the covered way—fine boys—I had forgotten! so may I live, if not for victory, still at the least for vengeance—reach down three carbines from the wall, there— they are all loaded—now light the matches —so give me that long Toledo—ha! here they come—they come! but by he fiends, too late! Charon, take thou Toraida—set her in safety in the forest, and thou hast won thy freedom. Pluto, bear thou Italian Beatrice! Thou art for me, Teresa—my girl, no dallying!” and he shook her fiercely by the arm, as she would have struggled to escape; for now the voices of her father—of her dear Amadis, came close upon her ear, above the clash and clatter of the contest, as they bore their last foes bleeding and breathless at the sword's point before them, and now they had won the staircase, and now were on the very threshold of the gay armory—too late! He had swung her up in his stalwart arms, threw her across one shoulder as though she had been an infant. “Follow me, Bella,” he cried, “follow close, thine English blood is brave, thou needest no supporter! follow me close, and bar the door behind!” and with the words he sprang across the vestibule, entered the secret stairway in the wall, and was just out of sight, when beating down the last of the defenders, Don Amadis darted through the opposite doorway with twenty veterans at his back. Well did the Rover say that fair girl's blood was brave; for as he left the armory, she snatched down from the wall a studded buckler of the tough hide of the rhinoceros, a light Damascus cimiter, and with her beautiful blue eyes beaming with fiery valor, made good the door in a moment, and barred and chained it fast in the very teeth of the foe. With speedy steps they trod the damp floors of the vaulted passage—they barred three massive doors behind them, yet with so desperate speed did Amadis pursue, plying his ponderous battle axe, that as they reached the sally-port, they heard him thundering already at the last portal they had passed—they hurried through the sally-port, a plank was thrust across the fosse, they darted over it in safety! —they stood in the wild forest!—another minute and they had been concealed in the dark mazes of a labyrinth so tortuous and dense, that scarcely could the keen instinct of an Indian have traced their flying footsteps! But at the very moment when they crossed the fosse, and climbed its landward face, five or six Spanish musqueteers, who stood on guard in the stone bastion, discovered them! blew their slow matches, levelled their long bright barrelled arquebuses, and a sharp volley followed! Three balls struck Ringwood; his left arm fell to his side shattered by one bullet—well was it for Teresa that he had just released her, or that same ball had borne her fate upon its wings!—a second pierced his broad chest; a third just grazed his muscular thigh—yet he flinched not, nor uttered any sign of pain nor wavered in the least. By the same volley the negro Charon fell, shot dead where he stood, by one ball; while another, so closely was that terrible discharge poured in, killed the poor Persian in his arms—happier so to fall, than to survive awhile and glut the furious vengeance of the enraged Castilians. “Ha, dogs!”—shouted the Rover—shaking his long bright rapier at them, in defiance: “Ha! dogs—would ye were at arm's length! Now, Pluto, quick! quick! while their muskets are discharged, pull the plank over to this side, and all will yet be well; quick!— quick, I say!—they come!” And they did come; swinging his rapier high in air, and leaping like a freed panther from the dark sally-port, all youthful energy, all high enthusiastic valor, young Amadis Ferrajo; and close to his heels, with his long grey locks all unhelmeted and floating on the breeze, and his antique steel panoply all blood from greaves to gorget, Juan Melendez de Aviles; and after these, Pedro, Gutierrez, Sanchez, and Diego, and fifty more hidalgos of Castile, with their high hearts aflame for deadly vengeance. Forth leaped young Amadis, the foremost; his foot was on the plank already; the cry of triumph ringing already from his lips, when almost simultaneously, the negro, who when he stooped down to remove the plank had not laid by his carbine, and the great Rover fired. Well was it for Don Amadis, his armor was Spain's choicest fabric; had it been steel of any foreign city, he had been sped that moment; for both balls took effect at scarce ten paces distance; one striking full upon the frontlet of his helmet, and leaving a deep dent in the trusty steel; the other actually penetrating the strong corslet, so fairly was it aimed, and even inflicting a slight wound; as it was, stunned and bewildered for the moment, he went down, and all around surely believed him dead, though in a little while he recovered himself and regained his feet. Teresa, who had been gazing on the little group, with hope fresh kindling in her heart, beheld him fall, and the light left her eyes, and she sank faint and senseless on the dark dewy earth. All this had passed in less time than is needed to describe it. As Amadis went down, Melendez took his place, and rushed across the narrow bridge, striking Pluto, with a single sweep of his two-handed broadsword, a breathless corpse into the stagnant moat; but while one foot was yet upon the quivering plank, the Rover leaped upon his foe. It was a desperate and a dreadful conflict, for the wounds, one of which was in truth slowly mortal, counterbalanced the advantage which Ringwood's youth would have otherwise given him over his aged yet still firm antagonist. Melendez was armed cap-a-pie all to his helmet; the Englishman was quite unarmed, with the exception of his long two-edged broadsword, so that the one had all his body to defend, the other his head only. Yet was this point of vantage neutralized by the extraordinary skill of fence, the blithe agility, the mighty strength of Ringwood, who like a wounded boar was but the fiercier and more furious for his hurts. Dreadful and desperate was that contest, yet it was over almost in a minute—their swords flashed like the beams of the noon-day sun, too dazzling and too fleet for any eye to trace them; yet ere six blows and parries were exchanged, the Rover's blade descended with such violence upon the weapon of Melendez, that it beat down his guard, and afterward inflicted a deep wound on his brow—the old man staggered back, the Rover pressing on with a fierce lunge, and sheathing his rapier in the Spaniard's throat above the gorget vein. “Ha! ha!” he laughed aloud with a fiendish tone, as he shook off his dying foeman from the point of his ensanguined weapon into the stagnant water of the ditch: “Ha! ha! ha! sister, sweet angel sister, thou art avenged! avenged! avenged! and I die happy!” and with the words, unhurt by any blow, unsmitten by any mortal hand in equal combat, he staggered up the slope, fell by Teresa's side, and was dead in a moment. Whether or no it was the sound of Ringwood's heavy fall beside her, cannot be told, but it is certain that as he dropped, she started to her feet, and, with recovered senses, gazed wildly about her. Her father's corpse she saw not, for falling into the deep wet fosse it had sunk instantly to the bottom, and was kept there by the weight of armor which it bore! but she did see her lover, whom she had fancied dead, alive and on his feet, and rushing to her rescue! she did see her deadly enemy prostrate and lifeless at her side! and over him with her broad blue eyes flashing fire, with lifted buckler, brandished blade, was the beautiful Bella, standing erect and fearless, so to defend from shame all that was left of her undaunted lover. Teresa screamed, she sprang to save her, but she was all too late, for flushed with victory, and mad with vengeful fury, the Spaniards were upon her. One good blow did the English girl strike at the nearest enemy; one good home blow, and the strongest man who met it staggered, and fell headlong! but ere he struck the earth, ten pike heads tore the lovely bosom of that frail faithful girl. As she had spoken, so she died! She died with him whom she would not survive! their life-blood mingled, as she breathed out her last sigh on his mangled breast; and one tomb held their bodies; for at Teresa's bidding, when the fierce rage of war was over, a tomb was reared by that calm basin, over the lovely Bella, and the great English Buccaneer. Long did Teresa mourn; long did she weep her brother and her father; yet her tears ceased at length to flow, as she blushed her consent to her young rescuer's ardent wooing; and, when they sailed together from the wild shores of Florida, for their dear Spanish home, the faithful slave Cassandra followed her mistress's footsteps; and many a time and often in after days and a far land, they shed a pitying tear for the kind-hearted English girl, and half admired the daring, even while they blamed the sins of Ringwood the great Rover!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GUARICA, THE CHARIB BRIDE. The heavy dew of the tropics was yet lying bright and unexhaled on every herb and flower; myriads of which, in most profuse variety of odor and bloom, strewed, like one gorgeous carpet, the beautiful savannahs, and wild forest glades of the fair province of Cahay. The sun had not fairly risen, although the warm and rosy light which harbingered his coming, was tinging, with its fairy dyes, the small and fleecy clouds that floated, like the isle of some enchanted sea, over the azure skies. The faint sea-breeze, which murmured still among the fresh green leaves, though it was fast subsiding, was laden with perfumes of such strange richness, that while they gratified they almost cloyed the senses; birds of the most superb and gorgeous plumage were glancing, meteor-like, among the boughs; but the innumerable insect tribes, which almost rival them in beauty, had not as yet been called forth to their life of a day, by the young sunbeams. The loveliness of those sequestered haunts, which had but recently been opened to the untiring and insatiate avarice of the Europeans, exceeded the most wild conceptions, the most voluptuous dreams, of the romancer or the poet. The solemn verdure of the mighty woods, thick-set with trees, more graceful than the shades of those ægean Isles, where the Ionian muse was born to witch the world for ages—the light and feathery mimosas, the fan-like heads of the tall palms, towering a hundred feet above their humbler, yet still lofty brethren—the giant oaks, their whole trunks overgrown with thousands of bright parasites, and their vast branches canopied with vines and creepers— masses of tangled and impervious foliage—the natural lawns, watered by rills of crystal—the rocks, that reared themselves among the forests, mantled not as the crags of the cold northern climes, with dark and melancholy ivy, but with festoons of fruits and flowers that might have graced the gardens of the fabulous Hesperides. It was upon such a scene, as is but imperfectly and feebly shadowed forth in the most glowing language, that the sweet dawn was breaking, when, from a distance, through the lovely woodlands, the mellow notes of a horn, clearly and scientifically winded, came floating on the gentle air; again it pealed forth its wild cadences, nearer and louder than before —and then the deep and ringing bay of a fullmouthed hound succeeded. Scarcely had the first echo of the woods replied to the unwonted sounds, before a beautiful, slight hind, forcing her way through a dense thicket of briers, dashed with the speed of mortal terror into the centre of a small savannah, through which stole almost silently a broad bright rivulet of very limpid water. Pausing for a second's space upon the brink, the delicate creature stood, with its swan-like neck curved backward, its thin ear erect, its full black eye dilated, and its expanded nostrils snuffing the tainted breeze. It was but for a second that she stood; for the next moment a louder and more boisterous crash arose from the direction whence she had first appeared—the blended tongues of several hounds running together on a hot and recent trail. Tossing her head aloft, she gathered her slight limbs under her, sprang at one vigorous and elastic bound over the rivulet, and was lost instantly to view among the thickets of the further side. A few minutes elapsed, during which the fierce baying of the hounds came quicker, and more sharply on the ear; and then, from the same brake out of which the hind had started, rushed, with his eyes glowing like coals of fire, his head high in the air, and his long feathery tail lashing his tawny sides, a formidable blood-hound, of that savage breed which was, in after times, so brutally employed against the hapless Indians by their Christian conquerors. Another, and another, and a fourth succeeded, making the vaulted woods to bellow with the deep cadences of their continuous cry. Hard on the blood-hounds, crashing through the tangled branches with reckless and impetuous ardor, a solitary huntsman followed splendidly mounted on a fiery Andalusian charger, of a deep chestnut color, with four white legs, and a white blaze down his face, whose long thin mane, and the large cord-like veins that might be seen meandering over his muscular, sleek limbs, attested, as surely as the longest pedigree, the purity of his blood. The rider was a young man of some four or five-and-twenty years, well, and rather powerfully made than otherwise, though not above the middle stature; his long dark hair, black eye, and swarthy skin told of a slight admixture of the Moorish blood; while the expression of his features, though now excited somewhat by the exhilaration of the chase, grave, dignified, and noble, bespoke him without a doubt a polished cavalier of Spain. His dress, adapted to the occupation which he so gallantly pursued, was a green doublet belted close about his waist by a girdle of Cordovan leather, from which swung, clinking at every stride of his horse, against the stirrup, a long and basket-hilted bilboa blade, in a steel scabbard, which was the only weapon that he wore, except a short two-edged stiletto, thrust into the belt at the left side. A broad sombrero hat, with a drooping feather, breeches and gloves of chamois leather, laced down the seams with silver, and russet buskins drawn up to the knee, completed his attire. He sat his horse gracefully and firmly; and the ease with which he supported him, and wheeled him to and fro among the fallen trees and rocks, notwithstanding the fiery speed at which he rode, bespoke him no less skilful than intrepid as a horseman. The chase continued for above an hour, during which every species of scenery that the level portions of the isle contained was traversed by the hunter; the open forest, the dense swampy brake, the wide luxuriant savannah—and each at such hot speed, that though he turned aside neither for bush nor bank, though he plunged headlong down the steepest crags, and dashed his charger, without hesitation, over every fallen tree that barred his progress, and every brook or gully that opposed him, still it was with no little difficulty that he contrived to keep the hounds in hearing. And now the hapless hind, worn out by the sustained exertions which had at first outstripped the utmost pace of her pursuers, but which availed her nothing to escape from foes against whose most sagacious instinct and unerring scent she had but fleetness to oppose—was sinking fast, and must, as the rider judged by the redoubled speed and shriller baying of his hounds, soon turn to bay, or be run down without resistance. Her graceful head was bowed low towards the earth; big tears streamed down her hairy cheeks; her arid tongue lolled from her frothing jaws; her coat, of late so sleek and glossy, was all embossed with sweat and foam, and wounded at more points than one by the sharp thorns and prickly underwood through which she had toiled so fruitlessly. Still she strove on, staggering and panting in a manner pitiful to witness, when the deep bay of the bloodhounds was changed suddenly into a series of sharp and savage yells, as they caught view of their destined prey. Just at this moment the hind had reached the verge of a piece of dense and tangled woodland, through which she had toiled for several miles, when the low range of hillocks which it overspread sank suddenly by a steep and craggy declivity of twelve or fourteen feet, having at its base a rapid stream, brawling and fretting over many a rocky ledge, down to a wide and lovely meadow. Situated nearly in the centre of this flower-sprinkled lawn, half circled by a deep bight of the streamlet, and perfectly embowered by the canopy which a close group of waving palms spread over it, there stood an Indian dwelling. It was of larger size than were most of the native cottages, thatched neatly with the broad leaves of the palm, and ornamented in front by a portico of wooden columns, quaintly, and not ungracefully adorned by carvings wrought by the flint-edged chisel of the yet unsophisticated savage. A mat, woven with tasteful skill, from many-colored and sweet-scented rushes, was spread upon the floor; while several stools of ebony, inlaid with shells, and sculptured with grotesque devices, were ranged along the walls. On a projecting slab, which apparently supplied the want of a table, stood several gourds, ingeniously manufactured into cups and trenchers; some bowls of hard wood, even more highly finished than the other articles of furniture, and many ornaments of gold and strings of pearl scattered in rich profusion, lay among the humbler vessels of the household. From three columns were suspended large wicker cages, beautifully interlaced with intricate and quaint devices, containing paroquets and other birds of rare and splendid plumage; while from the others hung carved war-clubs of the ponderous iron-wood, flint-headed javelins, and several bows—not the short, ill-strung, worthless weapons used by the Africans, but long, tough, and admirably made, and scarcely, if at all, inferior to the tremendous long bow which had gained so much renown, and wrought so much scathe to their foes, in the hands of the English archery. Under the shadow of the portico, sheltered by it from the warm beams of the sun, there sat an Indian youth, tall and slightly framed, and not above sixteen or seventeen years of age at the utmost, polishing with a chisel the shaft of a long javelin. On the lawn in front of the cottage a bright fire was blazing, and several native females were collected round it, preparing their morning meal, with cakes of the cassava baking among the hot wood-embers, and fish broiling on small spits of aromatic wood. But at a little distance to the left of these, at the extreme end of the building, nearest to the steep bank which terminated the forest, outstretched in a light grass hammock, which was suspended at the height of two or three feet from the ground, between two stately palm-trees, and swaying gently to and fro in the light currents of the morning breeze, there lay the loveliest girl eyes ever looked upon; her rich black hair, braided above her brow, and fastened with one string of pearls, was passed behind her ears, whence it fell in a profusion of glossy curls, so wondrously luxuriant that had she stood erect, it would have flowed quite downward to her ankles; her eyes large, dark, and liquid as those of a Syrian antelope, were curtained by the longest and most silky lashes that ever fringed a human eyelid; her features classically regular and even, were redeemed from the charge of insipidity by the sly dimple at the angles of that exquisitely arched and rosy mouth, which Aphrodite, fresh from her ocean cradle, might have envied; and by the voluptuous curve of the soft chin. Her complexion was of a warm and sunny hue— half brown and half golden—through which the eloquent blood mantled at every motion, like the last flush of sunset upon the darkening sky. Beautiful, however, as was the countenance, and enchanting the expression of this Indian beauty, it yet was not until the second or third glance that the eye could stray from the matchless symmetry, the untaught graces, and the voluptuous and wavy motions of her form, to notice the less striking charms of face and features. Her beautiful arms, bare to the shoulder, were adorned with massy rings of virgin gold, so flexible, from the purity of the metal, that they were twisted and untwisted with as much ease as though they had been silken cords; the right hung over the edge of the hammock, its small and graceful hand resting upon a little stand or table at her side—while the left, folded beneath her head, was half veiled beneath her abundant hair. Her dress, a single robe of soft, fine muslin, was clasped on the right shoulder by a golden stud, whence it passed under her left arm, leaving her bosom half exposed, and was girt around her slender waist by a cord of gaily-colored cotton, covering the rest of her person down to the tiny feet—although its slight folds clung so closely to the rich contour of her limbs that not a single charm but wooed the eye of the observer. Such was the scene, and such the occupants of it, into which, darting with a momentary energy, that gained convulsive strength from the near presence of her dreaded foes, the hunted hind leaped suddenly. The craggy bank and stream were cleared by one tremendous bound, the level lawn was traversed with speed that seemed almost miraculous, yet scarce two spears' length from her haunches the furious blood-hounds followed. Whether it was that her eyes were cast backward towards her dreaded foes, and that every sense was engrossed by agonizing terror, so that she marked not anything before her, or whether a strange instinct told her that no danger was to be apprehended from that quarter, the shy, timid creature dashed straight across the meadow, passing within ten paces of the fire— from the vicinity of which the women fled, fearful of the savage hounds—and sank down with a deep, heart-broken sob, close to the hammock of the Indian beauty. Roused suddenly from the half-dozing dreamy languor in which she had been so luxuriously indulging, the maiden started from the couch, and, without thinking of the peril, by an involuntary impulse stooped down, and lifting up the head of the dying hind, wiped away the foam from its sobbing lips, and gazed with wistful pity upon its glazing eyes. All this had passed with almost the speed of light—for not ten seconds had intervened between the first appearance of the trembling fugitive and the compassionate movement of the young girl. It happened, too, as will oftentimes occur, when hounds are running at the utmost of their speed, the blood-hounds, since they had viewed for the first time their quarry, had given no tongue, chasing solely by the eye—so that until his attention was called to what was passing, by the flight of the terrified and trembling menials, the youth had remained quietly engaged at his occupation, unconscious of the peril to which his sister—for such was the relationship between them—was exposed. Diverted, however, from his occupation, by the tumultuous flight of the girls, he looked up quickly, and at a glance beheld the hind fall dying at his sister's feet, the fierce hounds dashing forward to glut their savage instinct in the life-blood of the quarry; and the girl, by her own act, thrown, as it were, into the very jaws of the literally blood-thirsty brutes— which, with hair erect and bristling, as if instinct with sentient life and fury, the white foam flying from their tushes, and their eyes glaring with the frantic light of their roused natures, were bounding towards her, scarce three paces distant. At the same point of time the Spanish cavalier, who had, while they were running mute lost the direction of the chase, made his appearance at the top of the abrupt descent; and seeing, as if by intuition, all that was going on, lifted his blooded horse hard with the Moorish bit, on which he rode him, and pricking him at the same time sharply with the spur, undismayed by the sheer fall of the ground, compelled him to take the fearful leap. The horse sprang nobly at it, and, aided by the great fall of the surface, landed his hind feet well upon the level ground beyond the rivulet; but even then he would have fallen, such was the shock of so steep a drop leap, had he not been met by the quick support of a master hand; so that, recovering himself with a heavy flounder, he dashed on after scarce a moment's pause. Still, had there been no readier aid than his, the maiden must have perished beneath the fangs of the infuriate bloodhounds; for though the hunter shouted in the loudest tones of his clear, powerful voice, rating the dogs, and calling them by name, their fierceness was so thoroughly aroused that they paid not the least regard to his commanding accents, and probably would not have been restrained had he been interposed himself between them and the object of their stanch pursuit, from springing on the master who had fed them, and to whose slightest gesture, under more favorable circumstances, they were implicitly obedient. But as he saw them already well nigh darting at her throat, that stripling leaped upon his feet, and snatching from the nearest pillar a bow which fortunately happened to be strung, and two long arrows, in less time than is needed to describe it, notched a shaft on the sinew, drew the tough bow-string to his ear, and drove the whirling missile with almost the speed of light towards the leading dog. It was not till the whistling shaft hurtled close past her ear, that the maid was aware of her own danger; for, engrossed by the faint struggles and waning breath of the poor deer, she had not raised her eyes, till startled by the passing weapon; and now, as she lifted them, and met the red glare shot from the angry orbs of the foremost hound, and almost felt the warmth of his quick panting breath against her brow, hope left her; and her senses yielding to the sudden terror, she sank down upon the body of the dead hind, as helpless and as innocent. But even as light left her eyes, the well-aimed shaft reached its mark; directed at the throat of the animal, it flew correctly, and the keen flint-head, cutting a little way below the ear, clove through and through the neck, piercing the jugular vein. The blood gushed in a torrent from the wound; nor from that only, but from the throat and nostrils, likewise; and with one savage yell he leaped into the air, and fell quite dead within a yard of the Indian girl, whose snow-white dress was actually sprinkled with large gouts of the crimson gore. Still she was far from safe; for, unchecked and undaunted by their leader's death, the others of the little pack, baying tremendously, were close at hand. Again the bow was raised, and the string drawn to the utmost, but with a jerking and irregular tension, which snapped the tendon of which it was framed. With a sharp twang the bow recoiled, and the shaft fell harmless, close at the archer's feet; but, unarmed as he was, he bounded forward, and grasping the staff of the unstrung and useless bow, he gallantly bestrode the body of the damsel, and with a calm and resolute expression in his clear eye and comely features, awaited fearlessly the onset of the approaching savages. And now the first was close upon him, and with his bristles all erect, like quills upon the porcupine, and a deep stifled growl, dashed at his face. Still he blenched not, but made a desperate lunge with the tough horn-tipped bow, full at the open mouth and yawning throat of his assailant. And well for him it was that his eye was true, and his hand steady, for nothing else could have availed, even though now the cavalier was within three strides of the spot, to save his life. The thrust took effect, and though the weapon was but ineffective, and the beast not materially affected by the blow, it still had force enough to check, in some degree, the violence of his assault, and to hinder him from using his fangs for a moment. Yet, notwithstanding, such was the weight of his sinewy lithe body, and such the terrible impetuosity of his attack, that checked and foiled as he was, he still plunged so violently against the breast of his young antagonist, that he dashed him to the ground; and, himself falling, they rolled over and over, with a stem grapple and fierce cries, on the ensanguined green sward. But at this critical moment a new and more important aider came up in the young Spaniard; who, dashing his spurs into the flanks of his Andalusian, with his long two-edged sword unsheathed, and brandished in the air, as he stood upright in his stirrups, purposely galloped over one of the hounds, sending it cowed and howling to a respectful distance, then pulling up his horse close to the confused group, well knowing the tremendous fury of the animal with which he had to deal, when it was thoroughly aroused, he smote the other which was struggling with the boy, and which had just got free from his gripe, exactly at the junction of the neck and skull. So true and steady was the blow, and so keen was the temper of that thin two-edged blade, that it shore right through muscle, bone, and sinew, severing entirely the head, except where a small portion of the skin remained uninjured, at the further side. This done he hastily dismounted, and striking the fourth and last dog a heavy blow with the flat of his sword, rating him at the same moment by his name, succeeded in asserting his ascendency over his crest-fallen vassal. The boy had, in the meantime, risen from the ground, still grasping in his hand the bow, which, during all the progress of that tremendous struggle, he had never let go—and gazed, half doubtful of the stranger's purpose, into his eyes—till reassured by the grave smile which played upon the features of the Spaniard, and by perceiving how effectual had been his aid, when earthly aid seemed hopeless, he suffered the tense muscles of his dark visage to relax, and stretching out his hand to his preserver, uttered a few words in the Spanish language, not strictly true in the pronunciation, but in a voice of most melodious richness, thanking him for his timely aid. But little heed did the young gallant pay to his addresses, for he had thrown aside his blood-stained weapon, and raising the slight body of the maiden from the earth, for she had not as yet recovered from her fainting fit, bore her as easily as though she had been but a feather's weight, with her head leaning upon his shoulder, and her long tresses flowing in dark luxuriance over his arms, into the sheltered portico. Placing her on one of the low cotton cushioned stools, and supporting her against his breast, he called aloud in the Indian tongue, which he spoke fluently and well, for water; and having sprinkled her lovely face, he set about restoring her with a degree of eagerness that savored not a little of the gallantry of knightly courtship. Nor was it long before his efforts were crowned with complete success; for in a moment or two the fringed lashes partially arose, revealing the dark eyes, still swimming in unconscious languor. Dazzled by the full light, she once again suffered the lids to fall, and remained for a few moments perfectly passive in his arms; although he felt, by the increased pulsation of her heart, which throbbed almost against his own, that life and sense were speedily returning. Again she raised her eyes, and gazed for an instant with an air of simple wonderment in his face; then, while the warm blood rushed back in a crimson flush to the pale features, she attemped to start from the half embrace in which he held her. “Fear nothing, gentle one,” he said, in her own liquid tongue, with a calm placid smile, which did more to reassure her than the words which fell half unheard on her ear, yet confused and giddy. “Fear nothing, gentle one, from me. Not for the wealth of the whole Indies—not to be monarch of Castile, would I work aught of harm to thee or thine!” While he was speaking, her eye wandered from his face, and falling on the blood-stained group, which lay confusedly piled on each other—the lifeless limbs of the dead hind and fierce hounds, one transfixed by the unerring arrow of the brother, the other slain by the sharp rapier, which yet lay beside them on the turf—the panting charger, which stood, although unfastened, in the cool shade of the palm trees; and the two dogs which had survived their fellows crouched humbly on the grass before the portico, their tongues lolling from their jaws, their sides panting from their late exertion, and their eyes closed listlessly, she saw the truth intuitively, and, with a quiet smile, sank back again upon his breast, unable yet to rise, and lay there until her brother had brought forth the females of the household to attend her. Leaning on these, the fair girl left them, with a gesture of farewell as dignified, yet easy, as though she had been the lineal scion of a hundred European monarchs. She was not absent long, however, for she had returned ere the Spaniard learned from his host, while he was busily employed in wiping and returning to its scabbard his trusty rapier, in picketing his charger, and securing his two hounds—that the girl whom he had so bravely rescued from a terrible and painful death, was in good truth of royal birth—a Caribbean princess—the niece of that peerless queen Anacaona, who, though the sister of that most dauntless foeman of the white invaders, the valiant Caonabo, lord of the Golden House, had proved herself from first to last the friend and patroness of the pale stranger; who, in after days, returned her kindness with ingratitude so base and barbarous. In a short time, then, the Guarica returned, and thanking her preserver with the most feminine and easy grace, pressed him to stay and share their morning meal; and he, half captivated at the first by her artless beauty, assented willingly—and lingered there, enchanting the simple mind of the Indian beauty by all the rich stores of his cultivated intellect; and listening, in turn, to the sweet native ballads which she sang to him, in her rich melodious tongue, not till the morning meal alone was ended, but through the heat of the high noon, and even till the dewy twilight; and when he said adieu, a tear swam in the dark eye of the maiden, and her small band trembled in his grasp; and he rode pensively away beneath the broad light of a moon, a thousand times more pure and brilliant than that which silvers the skies of his own bright land, bearing along with him, far in his heart of hearts, deep thoughts and high warm feelings, blended with doubts and cares, and the engrossing impulses of interest conflicting with the wilder passions of a hot and impetuous nature. Nor did he leave behind him, in the breast of the young Guarica, sentiments less novel, or feelings less tumultuous. Truly, to them, that day was the hinge whereon the doors revolved of future happiness or misery! For, from that day, each dated a new life, fraught with new wishes, and regulated by new destinies—and to each was it the harbinger of many strange adventures, of many joys and many sorrows! and, whether for evil or for good, of their doom here, and it may be, hereafter. CHAPTER II. Days, months, and seasons held their course, yet there was no change in the deep azure of the glowing skies—no alteration in the green luxuriance of the forest—no falling of the woods “into the sear, the yellow leaf”—no fast succeeding variation from the young floweriness of spring-tide to the deep flush of gorgeous summer, and thence to the mature but melancholy autumn—to the grim tyrant, winter. In that delicious island nature had lavished on the earth, in her most generous mood, the mingled attributes of every clime and region. The tender greenery of the young budding leaf was blent at one and the same moment, and that moment, as it seemed, eternal, with the broad verdant foliage; the smiling bud, the odoriferous and full-blown flower, the rich fruit might be seen side by side on the same tree—on the same bough. Nothing was there to mark the flight of time—the gradual advance of the destroyer over the lovely land; nothing to warn the charmed spectator, that for him, too, as for the glowing landscape, maturity but leads to decay—decay which ends in death! Verily but it is a paradise for the unthinking! And who were more unthinking than the young Spaniard and his Indian love? Who were more happy? Morn after morn beheld Hernando de Leon threading the pathless forest —now with horse, horn, and hound, sweeping the tangled thickets—now skirring in pursuit of his falcon over the watery vegas; and now, with keen observant eye, and cat-like pace, wandering, arbalast in hand, in silent search after the timid deer; but still in one direction, and still with one intent to join the fair Guarica! Day after day they loitered, side by side, among the cool shades of the mighty woods, while the fierce sun was scourging the clear champaign with intolerable heat—or sat reclined by the cold head of some streamlet, fuller to them of inspiration and of love than were those fabled founts of Gadura, whence Eros rose of yore, twinborn with the dark Anteros, to greet the rapt eyes of Iamblichus. The powerful mind of the young soldier had been cultured, from his earliest youth, to skill in all those liberal arts and high accomplishments by which the gallant cavaliers of Spain had gained such honorable eminence above the ruder aristocracy of every other land. To his hands no less familiar were the harp and gittern than the Toledo or the lance. To his well-tutored voice, the high heroic ballads of his native land, the plaintive elegies of Moorish Spain, the wildly musical areytos of the Indian tongue, were equally adapted. Nor did its accents sound less joyously in the clear hunting halloa, or less fearfully in the shrill war shout, that it was oft attuned to the peaceful cadence of a lady's lute. His foot, firm in the stirrup, whether in the warlike tilt, in the swift race, or in the perilous leap, was no less graceful in the rapid dance, or agile in the wrestler's struggle on the greensward. He was, in short, a gentleman of singular accomplishment—of a mind well and deeply trained; shrewd, polished, courteous, yet keen and energetical withal, and brave as his own trusty weapon. Like every dweller of a mountain land, he possessed that high and romantic adoration of the charms of nature, that exquisite appreciation of the picturesque and beautiful— whether embodied in the mute creations of wood, wild, and water, or in the animated dwellers of earth's surface—which, in the breasts of others, is rather an acquired taste, nurtured by delicate and liberal education, than an intuitive and innate sense. Handsome, moreover, eloquent, and young, it would have been no great marvel had the brightest lady of the proudest European court selected Don Hernando as the ennobled object of a fresh heart's holiest aspirations. What wonder, then, that the untutored Indian girl, princess although she was, revered almost to adoration by her own simple people, secluded, from her earliest childhood, from aught of mean or low association, removed from any contact with the debasing influences of the corrupt and contaminating world, secured from any need of grovelling and sordid labor—voluptuous and luxurious as the soft climate of her native isle, yet pure as the bright skies that overhang it—romantic and poetical, as it would seem by necessity, arising from her lonely musing—what wonder that Guarica should have surrendered, almost on the instant, to one who seemed to her artless fancy, not merely one of a superior mortal race, but as a god in wisdom, worth, and beauty —a heart which had been sought in vain by the most valiant and most proud of her nation's young nobility. His grace, his delicate and courteous bearing, so different from the coarse wooing of the Charib lovers, who seemed to fancy that they were conferring, rather than imploring an honor, when they sought her hand; his eloquent and glowing conversation—these would alone have been sufficient to secure the wondering admiration of the forest maiden; but when to these was added the deep claim which he now possessed on her gratitude, for the swift aid which he had borne to her when in extremity of peril, and the respectful earnestness of pure, self-denying love which he displayed towards her, it wonld in truth have been well nigh miraculous had she resisted the impression of her youthful fancy. Nor were such unions between the dusky maidens of the west, and the hidalgos of Spain, by any means unfrequent or surprising, among the earliest of those bold adventurers who had been sharers, in his first and second voyages, of the great toils and mighty perils which had been undergone by that wise navigator who, in the quaint parlance of the day, gave a new world to Leon and Castile. On the contrary, it was rather the policy of that great and good discoverer, who, in almost all his dealings with the rude natives, showed higher sentiments of justice and of honor than could have been expected from the fierce and turbulent age in which he lived, to encourage such permanent and indissoluble alliances between the best and bravest of his own followers, and the daughters of the Caciques and nobles of the land, as would assuredly tend, more than any other means, to bind in real amity the jarring races brought into close and intimate contact by his discoveries and conquests. There was not anything, therefore, to deter Guarica from lavishing her heart's gem on the handsome cavalier who had so singularly introduced himself to her favor, and who so eagerly—nay, devotedly—followed up that chance-formed acquaintance. For several months, despite the ancient adage, the course of true love did, in their case, run smooth. No day, however stormy—for heavy falls of rain, accompanied by sudden gusts of wind, with thunder claps, and the broad fearful lightning of the tropics, were by no means unfrequent— prevented the adventurous lover from threading the tangled brake, scaling the steep, precipitous ascent, fording the swollen river—straight as the bird flies to his distant nest. No turn of duty hindered him—the imposed task performed— from hurrying through the hot glare of noon, or through the moonless night, to visit his beloved. At first, his well-known ardor in the chase accounted to his comrades for his protracted and continual absences from their assemblies, whether convened for woodland sports or wild adventure; but when it was observed that, though he never went abroad, save with the hawk and hound, or arbalast and the bird bolts, he brooked no longer any comrade in his sportive labors; that, though renowned above his compeers for skill and courage in the mimicry of war, he often now returned jaded indeed, and overspent with toil, but either altogether empty-handed, or at least so ill-provided with the objects of his unwearying pursuits, that it was utterly impossible to suppose that a hunter so renowned could have indeed spent so much toil and time, all to so little a purpose. This, for a short space, was the point of many a light jest—many a merry surmise gradually grew to be the subject of grave wonder and deliberation; for it was now remarked by all, even by his superiors, that Hernando—though he had been of yore the keenest volunteer to offer, nay, to urge his services, when any foray was proposed against the daring tribe of Caonabo, the bold Cacique of the Charibs, who now alone, of the five hereditary monarchs that erst held sway in Hispaniola, dared to wage war against the white invaders of his native fastnesses—no longer sought to be employed on such occasions—nay, that he even had refused, as it appeared, to those who had solicited aid, on slight and feigned excuses, to join their perilous excursions. Whispers increased among his comrades, and ere long grew to be dark murmurs —rumor said that no hunter ever saw the form of Don Hernando backing his fiery Andalusian, or heard the furious bay of his stanch bloodhounds in any of those haunts where strayed most frequently, and in the greatest plenty, the quarry which he feigned to chase; fame said, and for once truly, that though the best scouts of the Spaniards had been urged by curiosity to play the spy upon his movements, their utmost skill had availed nothing; that whether in broad day or in the noon of night, they never could keep him in view beyond the margin of one belt of forest land, or track the foot-prints of his charger, although the soil was deep and loamy, into its dark recesses; that, in whatever course he turned his horse's head, or bent his footsteps, on departing from the fortress of his friends, he ever reached by devious turns, and secret bypaths, that same almost impenetrable thicket, and there vanished. It was an age of credulous fear—of dark, fanatical superstitions. He who, a few short months before, had been the idol of his countrymen, the soul of their convivial meetings, the foremost and the blithest in their bold hunting matches, was now the object of distrust, of doubt, of actual fear, and almost actual hatred. Some said that he had cast by his allegiance to his country and his king—that he had wedded with an Indian girl, and joined himself to her people, heart and hand—that he kept up this hollow show of amity with his betrayed forsaken countrymen only that he might gain some sure and fatal opportunity of yielding them, at once, to the implacable resentment of the Charib Caonabo. Others, more credulous still, averred, in secret, that he had leagued himself, more desperately yet, and yet more guiltily, with creatures of another world! that mystic sounds, and voices not of human beings, had been heard by the neighbors of his barrack-chamber! and one, he who had scouted him furthest and most closely, swore that, on more than one occasion, he had beheld a grim and dusky form rise suddenly, as if from out the earth, and join him in the wildest of those woodlands through which he loved to wander. Thus did the time pass onward—Hernando and Guarica becoming every day more fond and more confiding, and, if that could be, more inseparable; and, at the same time, suspicion, enmity, distrust, becoming more and more apparent at every hour between him and his Spanish kinsmen. Thus did the time pass onward, without the occurrence of anything of moment either to disturb the blissful dreams of the young lovers, or to awaken a suspicion in their breasts, that they were themselves the objects of distrust or of espial. Yet every day closer and closer were the toils contracting round them; strong enmities were at work, weaponed by puissant energies and quick intelligences; and, though they knew it not, they were even now on the brink of an abyss. Thus did the time pass onward; till, on a close and sultry afternoon, in the latter part of autumn, when the thunder clouds were mustering thick over the azure vault, and now and then a pale flash on the far horizon, succeeded by a distant rumble, told of the coming hurricane, three or four horsemen, whose dress and accoutrements proclaimed them at once to be Spaniards from the fortress, were seen to issue from the forest, and ride rapidly across the little plain towards Guarica's dwelling. At first a blithe smile lighted up the features of the young princess, as the sound of the hoofs came to her ears, while, occupied in light feminine labor, she was standing in the inner chamber of her cottage—for, horses being as yet the exclusive property of the invaders, and no other Spaniard than her own Hernando having as yet visited that sequestered spot, she doubted not that it was her lover, who, in the eagerness of his unwaning passion, had thus anticipated the hour of his coming. Full of this sweet idea, her lovely features gaining a deeper and more feeling charm, from the inspiration which seemed to infuse them at the mere thought of him she loved so passing well, she bounded forth to meet him. But, before even her foot had crossed the threshold, she repented her precipitation: although it was already too late to remedy it. Her ear, quicker by nature than that of any European, and sharpened now beyond its wonted keenness by the strange powers of overruling passion, had detected, even as she sprang forth to meet the comers, first, that instead of one there were several horses, and next, that her lover's Andalusian was not of the number. Strange it may seem that that lovely girl, who, perhaps, never in her life had seen ten horses, nor listened to the tread of any save Hernando's charger, could have sworn to his springy tramp out of ten thousand—strange it may seem, and incredible to us, whose instincts are quenched by dwelling amid the monotonous occurrences of a life spent in the midst of busy crowds, whose ears are deadened and eyes dimmed unto the sounds and sights of nature; but it is true—she knew it in an instant, and half paused upon the door-sill, wondering what chance could have brought strangers thither; and apprehending, she knew not what, of coming evil. And all of us know—at least all of us who have known sorrow, or anxiety, or even strong and overmastering passion—how rapidly thought flits at times through the spirit— how that, which to the body is but a point of time, but a fleet second, may to the mind be an age of ages. In the mere instant that Guarica, bounding forth towards the portico, paused half alarmed upon the threshold, a hundred flitting fancies passed through her brain—fancies of joy, and hope, and agony, almost despair—but with the instant which had given them birth they ended. Knowing instinctively that she must have been seen already, and having, though more than a little frightened, no motive for concealment, she stepped forth quietly; and found herself in the presence of two persons, whom her quick intelligence discovered instantly to be cavaliers of rank and birth; and as many more whom she recognised as servants, with hounds in leashes, and hawks on their fists, who had just pulled up their horses at the door. He, who appeared the principal personage of the two, was a tall, powerful, gaunt man, not in reality above a year or two De Leon's senior, but in exterior show far more advanced in life. This might have been the consequence of the hardships he had undergone, or it might have arisen from the predominance of those fierce and fiery passions which wear away the body, even as a keen blade frets and in time destroys its scabbard—but, whether from one cause or the other, his brow, instead of presenting the fair bread expanse which was so striking in Hernando's noble countenance, was furrowed by three wrinkles, as deep as are usually seen in men of sixty years; and these were again cut at right angles by the strong indentation of an habitual frown. The features were all in themselves well formed and handsome, although the aquiline nose was so thin as to seem almost fleshless, the cheeks hollow, and the eyes sunken. The general expression, too, was grave and dignified, and far from unpleasing; although the heaviness of the brow cast over it a sort of melancholy gloom; and at times a dark sneering smile distorted the thin lips, altering for the worse the entire character of the face, and giving it, so long as it lasted, a singular and intense air of malignity and contempt. The figure of this gentleman was, it is true, gaunt and thin, almost to meagreness; but not so much as to impair, in any degree, his muscular and sinewy strength, which appeared to be prodigious. His demeanor, though somewhat formal and stately, was full of the grace of dignity, if not of ease; and his whole aspect, set off by his dark, rich hunting-dress and his magnificent bay charger, was striking and impressive. His companion was an older man, yet bearing in his round and jovial face, although his hair and beard were grizzled, far fewer marks of age than his fellow-hunter. This was a broad and square-set person, with a quick merry eye, a bronzed face, and a constant smile about his full, arched lips; his countenance, too, was as strongly marked with bold and daring frankness, as was the other's with dark and suspicious gloom; and his bearing as abrupt and impulsive, as his friend's was self-restrained and formal. Any one at all used to judge of men's professions by their aspect or their manners, might have pronounced this gentleman a sailor, without fear of contradiction—nor did his seat or hand upon his horse, which were both artless and ungainly, contradict the surmise. He, too, was richly dressed, though far more gaudily than his companion, and he bestrode a strong and active horse, quite equal to his weight, though lacking the high, blood-like type, and spirited action, of the bay charger by his side. It was the former of the two cavaliers who, with an air half-insolent, half-condescending, addressed Guarica, as she came forth upon the portico, in a few words, imperfectly pronounc ed and ungrammatically put together, of the Indian dialect of that province; requesting permission to take shelter, until the storm, which was threatening so nearly, should pass over, and alleging, as a further cause for their intrusion, that they had seen the building from the edge of the forest, wherein they had been hunting all the morning, just as they were deliberating whither they should fly for refuge from the tornado. Guarica replied instantly, in pure Castilian, to which the most critical ear could have taken but slight objection; begging them to alight from their horses, and accept such accommodation as her poor dwelling could afford them. “Stables,” she added, “we, of course, have none to offer you; but there is a hut yonder, which we use as a store-house, empty now, wherein your serving-men can tie their horses. I beseech you enter.” Neither of the cavaliers, both of whom dismounted instantly, showed the least surprise, or made any comment on her speaking the Spanish tongue so fluently; although the younger cast a quick, keen glance, accompanied by the peculiar smile which has been mentioned, to his comrade, as they followed her, after giving directions to their servants, into the building. For she paused not to show them the way humbly, but led them, with the air and gesture of a princess, into her dwelling. Again a look of intelligence was interchanged between the Spaniards; and the sailor licked his lips with the affectation of a liquorish air, as she swept forward; but there was nothing in the look that betokened astonishment, though there was much that spoke of admiration, and perhaps something of self-gratulation at their own shrewdness. Could they have read, however, all that was passing in Guarica's mind, they would perhaps have found less reason for the latter sentiment than they imaginned; so accurately had the wild Indian girl already judged the cause and the motives which had brought them to her lonely dwelling. Her quick eye, running over the whole group, even in the short time while the cavalier was speaking to her, had taken in, without seeming to note anything at all, the closest and most minute details. Thus, among other things, she observed that both the gentlemen and their followers were armed far more heavily than was usual for hunters; both the latter having the short, heavy arquebuses of the day slung at their backs, and both the former carrying huge wheel-lock pistols at their holsters. She saw, moreover, that although the horses were somewhat heated, as must be the case in a day so singularly sultry, they were not splashed with mud, or embossed with foam— that the hounds were as sleek as when they left their kennel in the morning, and evidently had not been uncoupled—and that the dresses of the riders were in too orderly array, with their plumes trim and unbroken, and their spurs bright and bloodless, to allow it to be imagined, even by a novice, that they had been engaged, for hours, in so rude a pastime as the chase, and that, too, in so wild a forest region. A slight smile of contempt flitted across her lovely face, as she thought within herself— “They are but poor deceivers, after all—perhaps, in their self-opinion, they fancy that it needs no exertion of their high European faculties to dupe a savage. But this time they are mistaken. They are no hunters, that is clear. I wonder what has brought them hither?—No good!—no good! I fancy. I do not like the tall man's looks; but I will watch, I will find out, before they go.” And even while she was pondering these things with herself, she called three or four Indian maidens from an inner room, and having spoken a few words in a low tone to one, who darted out of the house immediately, and made her way, without being seen by the Spaniards, into the forest, she gave directions to the others to prepare refreshments for the strangers; and though she spoke in her own language, she used phrases so purposely simple, that they were readily understood by her unwelcome guests, who had just entered. Their instructions to the servants ended, “It is fortunate,” she then said, quite naturally, and as if she believed their story perfectly—“it is very fortunate that you should have seen our cottage, for there is no village or house very near us; and I think we shall have a heavy storm. I almost wonder you should have ventured so far from Isabella. We have seen the clouds gathering here all the morning.” “It is fortunate, indeed,” said the younger cavalier, “and I believe we must confess ourselves but artless woodmen, Sanchez and I— for we had no suspicion of the storm at all, till we heard the thunder. Yes, thanks to Heaven! we are wondrous fortunate.” “You will think so, should it prove such a tornado as I look for,” she answered, simply, looking out of the open door towards the storm-clouds, which were gathering thicker every moment. “I meant that we are fortunate in finding so sweet and beautiful a hostess, here all alone, in the wild forest, and speaking our own tongue, too, like a Castilian princess! Are you the lady of the castle, fair one? and do you queen it here alone, without court, or guards, or courtiers?” “Oh!” she replied, with a light laugh, “I have heard of your grand Spanish compliments, which you cavaliers deem it right to bestow on every woman, if she be old even, and wrinkled. And, as for speaking your language, I must have been dull indeed had I not learned it from aunt Anacaona; and more—” “Anaçaona! And have we indeed the happiness to kiss the hands of a niece of that peerless queen and lady, the friend and protectress of our people?” exclaimed the same gentleman who had spoken before; while his ruder companion broke out into a loud whistle of astonishment, which he expressed yet further by a loud sea-faring oath, and a repetition of the name, Anaçaona! “The queen Anaçaona is my aunt, and has ever been the Spaniards' friend—may they prove grateful to her. But I was about to say that I do not live alone; my brother, Orozimbo, dwells with me, and will be here anon; he, like yourselves, is hunting with his vassals. I would he were here to receive you more befittingly.” “That were impossible, most peerless flower,” began the cavalier, but Guarica quietly interrupted him. “I pray you pardon me, Senor,” she said, “but if we have learned your language in order to converse the better with our masters,” and she laid rather a bitter emphasis on the last word, “we have not yet adopted, nor do we wish to do so, your gallant modes of speech, which seem to us mere falsehood and hypocrisy. My name is Guarica, a simple Indian girl, and neither flower nor pearl—as such I am glad to shelter and to serve you. Will you not walk into the inner chamber? you will find seats there to repose you; and my maidens will bring some wine of the palm and some fresh water; you must be parched with thirst. Pray enter—make no ceremony—and excuse me.” And with the words she raised a many-colored mat of rushes, which hung across a low doorway, and waving them towards the large airy chamber wherein she was sitting when their horses' tread apprised her of their coming, she retired from the hall, where they had as yet been standing, and left them alone to their own devices. “By Heaven! but this is a strange business, Guzman,” exclaimed the sailor, now speaking for the first time. “I do not wonder at Hernando passing his time here, nor do I blame him for it, by St. Jago! I would I were in his shoes. She is the perfection of a bona roba. I wonder has he married her, or does she love him paramour? But what the devil are we to do next?” “You are to hold your tongue—that is to say if you can, by any means, and not to spoil everything by your absurd and ill-timed jesting; and, above all, you are not to keep calling me Guzman and Herreiro,” he added, sinking his voice into a whisper, as he pronounced the last words. “I vow to God, if you do it again I will put my dagger into you.” “Your dagger, will you?” answered the other, bursting into a rough laugh. “No you won't! no you won't, Guz—plague on it! there I go again. Who the devil can think of such things? but you will put no dagger into me, I can tell you.” “And why not? why not, I pray you, when you plague me so—when you would plague the archangel Gabriel out of patience with your buffoonery and folly? why should I not?” “In the first place, because I would not let you—why two can play at dagger-work as well as one, man! and I think I am as good as you, any day. But if I were not, I wear a secret, when I ride with you—for I have heard a thing or two, and I don't forget what I hear, either—” “What have you heard? what have you heard?” exclaimed the other, furiously, but turning very pale as he spoke. “Say on—I insist on your saying on! You have said too much, or not enough; speak! out with it, what have you heard?” “Nay,” said the sailor, “never mind—I do not want to quarrel; and if I did, this is no place for it. Let us go in, as the girl told us. I would not have said aught, but you spoke of stabbing me. Come, come—forget it! let us go in.” And, with the words, he stalked on with a sturdy step, and a quiet fearless smile, into the room Guarica had indicated; but the other paused behind, and muttered through his teeth, “He knows too much! he knows too much! He is dangerous; but what a fool he was to let me find it out. In one thing he is right, however, this is no place, and no time, either; and we have other cards to play, too, for the nonce! but patience—patience!” And, with a grim smile, he too walked in after his companion, and throwing himself down on a pile of soft cotton cushions, smoothed his disordered features, and took a careful observation of the room, and every article which it contained. And there were many things most unusual to behold in an Indian's dwelling, and such as must naturally have excited both comment and surprise in any persen not prepared fully to encounter them. Upon a centre table of some variegated wood, elaborately carved and polished, lay several Spanish books of romance and poetry, a mandolin of exquisite workmanship, and several sheets of music, marked with the rude notation of the day. There was a standish, too, with several pens, both of reed and quills, and several rolls of parchment. Upon the walls were five or six bold and masterly sketches of combats with the Moors of Granada, and one or two views and sea pieces. In one corner of the room stood a long arquebuse, which both the strangers recognised in a moment; while, from the antlers of a stag, which adorned the wall, there hung a powder-horn, a set of bandoleers, a pair of gilt Spanish spurs, and a hunting-bugle. Upon a long divan or couch under the window was a black velvet cloak and a plumed hat. At these things, when Herreiro entered, the man he had called Sanchez was gaping with a fixed wondering stare, and when he perceived that the other had come in, he pointed to them with his finger, and was about to speak, when Guzman cut him short in a quick whisper. “I see, I see—it is just as I thought; but do not seem to notice them—for God's sake do not speak; I am sure that girl is watching us. I do beseech you, do not seem to see, and yet see everything.” “Tush! you are always so suspicious; now, I think—” “Of course you do,” Herreiro again interrupted him—“of course you think it is going to rain; why it is raining over there already.” Sanchez stared at him, but before he could reply, Guarica, who had entered unperceived by him, as he sat with his back towards the door, though Herreiro had perceived her, invited him to take some wine which a girl was just bringing, with tropical fruits and cool water. In a few moments afterwards Orozimbo entered, carrying in his hand a couple of long javelins, the head of one of which was wet with fresh blood; and followed by several Indians, two of whom bore a deer, slung by its legs to a pole resting on their shoulders. These threw themselves down to rest under the portico, but Orozimbo walked straight into his sister's guest-chamber; and though he expressed no surprise, but greeted his visitors hospitably, it was evident to his sister that he partook of her astonishment, if not of her apprehension. Meanwhile the storm burst with a degree of intense and concentrated fury that cannot be conceived till it is seen, and can be seen only within the tropics; the thunder rolled in one continuous and incessant roar—the whole expanse of heaven was one broad glare of blue and livid lightning—the wind raved horribly, sweeping the largest trees away as if they were mere straws in its path. At length the rain poured down in torrents, the wind sank, the thunder died away—the danger was at an end; and, within two hours, the setting sun beamed out again serenely, and not a token of the storm was to be felt or seen, save in the fallen trees, and in the freshness of the air, cooled and reanimated by the thunder-gust. During the storm the strangers had conversed on many subjects, endeavoring, evidently, and the younger man more particularly, to render themselves agreeable to Guarica; and, above all, to appear perfectly at ease and offhanded. But in neither one nor the other of these ends were they at all successful; and that, too, as it often happens, in consequence of the very means they took to promote them. In the first place, the courtly air, overstrained compliments, and yet more than these, the ominous and sneering smile of Guzman, impressed Guarica with feelings of anything rather than favorable; and, in the second, the very care which the strangers took to avoid all allusion to the articles betokening, as clearly as spoken words, the habitual intercourse of the inhabitants with some gentleman of Spanish blood, convinced her—not that they did not see them—for that would have argued them blind, or at least stupidly unobservant— but that they were prepared to see them there; and that their visit was, in some sort, connected with Hernando de Leon. As the storm had now cleared off, and as night was drawing near, they had no excuse for remaining longer; and, with many courteous speeches, and many formalities of thanks and leave-taking, they mounted their horses and departed—having declined Orozimbo's offer to send a guide to show them the nearest way to the fortress of Isabella. Among the last words he uttered, Guzman had, with great adroitness, as he thought, contrived to let out very naturally that his own name was Sylva de Fronteiro, while he continually addressed the sailor as Juan Sanchez; thereby convincing Guarica, beyond a peradventure, that both these titles were unreal; for she had overheard the latter call Herreiro Guzman, and had caught some words of the rebuke which the blunder had called forth. In a word, neither the brother nor sister was deceived, for scarcely had they ridden ten yards from the door before Orozimbo said— “Who are they, Guarica; who are they; and what brought them hither?” “Nay, brother,” answered the lovely girl, “I never saw either of them before; they said they were out hunting, but that is not true, for they had never let their hounds loose, nor even soiled their boots.” “They are spies,” said the boy, “spies on Hernando, and I fancy they gave us false names.” “I am sure they did,” answered Guarica, “I heard the little man call the other `Guzman,' when they thought me out of hearing; but De Leon will be here anon, and then we shall know all about it.” “I will know all about it sooner. What ho! give me my bow and arrows there. What time comes Hernando?” “Not till the moon is above the forest-tops; he was on guard all day,” answered Guarica, simply. “And that they knew right well,” said Orozimbo, “but I will find them out! And now one word, Guarica—be thou sure that De Leon means thee honor. These Spaniards—aye, the best of them, are but false knaves and liars; and by the sun and moon, and all the hosts of heaven! if he be the villain to deceive thee, and thou the dupe to be deceived, this hand—this very hand of mine—dost understand, Guarica? Girl! girl! I would rather see thee dead—dead by my own hand, than guilty with a Spaniard!” “And I would rather be so dead,” replied the girl, very firmly; “but you wrong both him and me.” “Look to it, thou, that it be so! Fare thee well; remember who thou art, and who were they before thee. Ere the moon set will I learn something of these fellows.” And snatching his long bow and four shafts from the tall Indian who had brought them at his bidding he waved a farewell to his sister, bounded across the lawn, and entered the forest at the point where, a little while before, the cavaliers had struck it on their route for Isabella. CHAPTER III. The strangers had not ridden many yards across the meadow, before one of the servants spurred his horse sharply forward, and riding up alongside of his master, said— “I do not know, my lord, what the girl meant, when she said there was no stabling; for I never laid my eyes, in all my life, on a neater rack and manger than were in that shed or outhouse—and a good steel chain with a running billet, and a head-stall of Spanish leather, fit for a count's charger. Good store there was of bedding, too, and better maize than we have at the fort for the troop horses. Nor was that all, senor, for there had stood a horse there within twelve hours—there was fresh dung in the stall.” “I know—I know, Pacheco, all about it,” replied Guzman, “and thou shalt know, too, one of these days—so thou wilt only hold thy peace—one word blabbed at the guard-room or canteen will spoil everything.” “You may trust me, my lord—I never talk!” “I know you never do, Pacheco,” answered Herreiro; “you are a faithful fellow, as well as a stout soldier.” The man touched his bonnet, and fell back to his companion, highly gratified, and began inculcating to him the necessity of silence. “Well—I hope you are now satisfied,” said the sailor. “I hope you are satisfied that, as yon runagate Charib dog informed you, Hernando comes hither to court you Indian beauty She is temptation enough, truly, without bringing treason in to aid. Why, she would set half Ferdinand's court afire with those eyes of hers, half passionate lustre and half sleepy languor!” “Satisfied am I, right well, that thou art a fool, Gomez,” said Herreiro; “I doubt not now that you fancy I shall abandon it—” “I don't see, for my part, what there is to abandon, or to prosecute either. Here has Hernando de Leon seduced a pretty Indian, and passes all his spare time fondling her—well! there is no sin against martial law in that, I trow—or if there be, few of us here shall escape the provost marshal. Or if you like better, he is wooing her to honorable marriage —and that the old admiral is like to consider an especial service; particularly when the wooer stands so high for prowess as Hernando; and when the bride is the niece of the unconquered Caonabo—why, he will deem it a sure pledge of the pacification of the race.” “I thought as much—just such an argument as a thick-skulled, addle-brained sailor like yourself would be sure to draw from it. But I—I can see further. I will so plot it, that I will brew from these ingredients—” “Beware that your brewing,” interrupted the other, “return not bitterly to your own lips. For all that I can see, all you are like to gain in this matter, is that Hernando will knock your brains out, like a mad dog's, for meddling with his inamorata.” “Would God that he would try it—I ask nothing better—anything, anything to give me a chance of one fair thrust at his accursed heart!” “I' faith, you are a good hater—whatever you may be beside,” answered the sailor Gomez; “but, for my part, I cannot see why you hate the lad so deadly. They tell me he has saved your life some three or four times—” “Thrice! thrice! curses be on his head!” replied Don Guzman, gnashing his teeth with deadly spite. “It is for that—for that I hate him! From the first time I ever saw him, I felt that in him was my bane. In everything he has crossed my path—in everything outdone me, foiled, defeated me—his praises are the deadliest poison to my soul—and, from my school-days upward, his praises have never for a moment ceased to ring trumpet-like in my ears. Then, as in veriest spite of Fortune, he must make me the very butt whereon to prove his valor, his magnanimity, his self-devotion— he must force me, whom it well nigh choked in the utterance, to swell the burden of his glory. Death to his soul! how I hate him!— and then, here, here is new cause for hatred, if there were none before.” “Here?—new cause here?—in what, I prithee?” “Here!—art thou blind, Gomez? Here in this girl, this angel, this Guarica!—but if I call the fiend himself to aid, here I will outdo him.” Gomez looked long and steadily in his companion's face, as if he would fain have read something there, which he expected; but, disappointed, he withdrew his eyes, and shook his head doubtfully. “What, in the name of all the fiends of hell! dost thou stare so for? What seest thou in my face, man, to fascinate thee?” “Naught! Guzman—naught! I looked to see utter madness—stark lunacy—sheer frenzy! but I see none of these things—and yet so surely as there is a God in heaven, thou must be mad—” “For what should I be mad—I pray thee?” answered Herreiro, angrily! “my pulse is as cool as thine, my brain a thousand times more clear, and vivid in conception—for what should I be mad?—for loving this most perfect of heaven's creatures?” “Aye! for that very thing—most vivldly mad!” replied the sailor. “I knew you ever for a fierce and voluptuous devil, but thy blood must indeed be like Greek fire to blaze out thus unquenchable at one spark from a brown wench's eye!—most wildly mad in this—and absolutely frenzied, when you would dream of winning her from De Leon. Why he hath had her heart, possessed her soul, these six months—and think you that he is so weak a rival, and that too, when so stabilished in her favors? Why, if you and he were to start fairly, he could give you his topsails and beat you; as I have seen an Algerine felucca run our best caravellas hull down in an hour. Tush! man, think better of it—to judge by one look I saw her give you, were you the only one in the island, she would have none of you!” “I will have her—or die for it!” answered Don Guzman, fiercely. “So let that be the end of it!” “The end of it, then, let it be—as it will sure enough! For Hernando will kill you like a rat, as soon as he finds you meddling with his Bonnibella. But we had better ride on somewhat quickly now, and get out of his track; for we are in the very path he always rides; and he is off his guard by this time, and is now flying hitherward, I warrant me, upon the wings of hot anticipation!” “That is the first word of sense you have spoken to-night,” said Herreiro; “let us gallop.” And with the word they put their horses to their speed, and dashed along the sort of forest path, which had been worn in the virgin soil by the hoofs of De Leon's Andalusian, so constantly during the last six months had he passed 5 and repassed between the cottage of his love and the Spanish fortress. After an hour's riding they came to a spot where a broad shallow rivulet, flowing upon a pebbly bed, rippled across the path, and turning abruptly into its channel to the left hand of Hernando's track, they descended it slowly, the waters rarely mounting above their horses' fetlocks, for something better than a mile, where it flowed out of the shadowy woods, into an open plain or bega, wide of Hernando's route, across which they sped rapidly towards Isabella. It was not, probably, half an hour after the time of their turning into the stream that the tramp of a horse, had there been any one there to listen, might have been heard coming up from the settlements, and in a moment or two, De Leon, followed by his trusty hounds, cantered along the path; but as he reached the little ford he pulled up suddenly, for there, in the centre of the horse track, stooping down as if to examine some late footprints in the mois! soil, stood the Charib boy Orozimbo. “Ha! Orozimbo—what hath brought thee so far from home at this untimely hour!” “Knavery, if not villany, Hernando,” answered the youth, in Spanish, which he spoke now with much more accuracy, both of pronunciation and of syntax, than he had done at his first meeting with De Leon; but still not nearly with so correct an emphasis as his beautiful sister—“and perchance treason!” “Treason!” cried the young Spaniard, “by whom, or whom against? what do you mean, boy?” “By whom, I know not,” answered Orozimbo, “but against thee, if I err not.” And he proceeded to relate to him the circumstances of the visit Guarica had received that day; and their reasons for suspecting that all was not right, nor as it seemed to be. He described the persons of the riders with a degree of minute accuracy, extending to the smallest details of their dress, to the fashion of their spurs, the ornaments of their sword hilts, the marks and colors of their horses, the very spots on their hounds; such things as no mortal eye, save of an Indian, could have observed in so short a period, as had enabled him to take in and comprehend the whole. At first, Hernando de Leon listened half carelessly, thinking in his own mind that the visit must have been purely accidental, attaching little consequence to the details, and half inclined to smile at the habitual suspicion of the Indian, so characteristically and needlessly displayed. Soon, however, it appeared that his attention was excited, for he now listened eagerly, asked two or three quick and pertinent questions, to which he received answers as intelligent and clear—and, after the boy had ceased speaking, pondered for a few moments deeply, and then said— “That is odd—it must have been Gomez Aria, with Guzman de Herreiro—there are no others in the fortress to whom this description could apply—” “Yes! yes!” interrupted Orozimbo, eagerly; `I had forgotten that—Guarica heard the short man call the other, `Guzman.' It was they, I am sure of it. Are they friends of yours?— are they true men?” “Herreiro is: I would stake my soul's salvation on it! I have saved his life thrice, at the risk of my own. And as for Gomez, he is a good blunt sailor—and I have never wronged him. Yet it is passing strange. You say they rode home by this path?” “To this spot, and here they have turned off down the rivulet's bed to avoid meeting you; knew they the hour at which you would leave Isabella?” “Herreiro did, for he asked me to ride out with him to-day, and I told him I was officer of the guard until eight o'clock at night. I wondered somewhat when he asked me; for I have noted a shade of coolness in his manner lately.” “Beware of him!” said Orozimbo; “he means you no good. They had not been hunting; no! not they; they had not so much as uncoupled their bloodhounds. And neither one nor other of them noticed, or seemed to see, the Spanish books or the music which you left the other day; or even your gun and bugle horn. Had they been honest, they would have naturally inquired about those things, which are not to be found, you know, in every Indian's cabin.” “He can mean me no evil,” said Hernando, thoughtfully; “he never had a cause—” “He has one now!” answered Orozimbo, quickly. “He has a cause now? a cause to mean me ill? How so—what cause?” “Guarica.” “Guarica? how? a cause to injure me! Guarica?” “Yes! yes! Guarica; for he loves her.” “Loves her? Why he has never seen her but for an hour to-day—and do you say he loves her?” “Aye!” said the boy, drily, “loves her, as much as you Spanish ever love Indian maidens. He lusts after her young beauty—” “Hold, Orozimbo!” said De Leon, looking him steadily and sternly in the face, “was that meant to me?” “Perhaps!” answered the youth, gloomily, “perhaps! and yet no! no! I believe thou art honest, De Leon. Yet I doubt, sometimes, even thee.” “Mark me, Orozimbo,” replied Hernando, leaning from his tall charger, and pressing the naked shoulder of the Charib heavily with his right hand, “mark me. For myself, I care not for your suspicions; but if I deemed that your rash tongue dared syllable one doubt of Guarica's purity—that your brain had surmised, even for a second's space, that she would listen to a dishonorable suit—her brother though you be—” “What then, her brother though I be, what then?” cried Orozimbo, under strong excitement. “I would strike you to my feet!” the young Spaniard answered, gravely, “to my feet! for calumniating, in your sister, one of God's angels!” “You would do well!” cried the boy, grasping his hand; “I should deserve it! But I doubt neither of you—least of all her! But when I think of the wrongs you Spaniards have done to us—of our hearths defiled, our names disgraced, our wives and sisters torn from our bosoms, wooed and caressed and courted until your passions or your whims are satisfied, and then sent back dishonored and undone to be a blot upon the homes they once adorned—when I think on those things, Hernando de Leon, my soul grows black within me, and I doubt all things! and I tell you— you who love her—I marked you Guzman's dark and snakelike eye dwell on Guarica's form, as never man's eye dwelt on maiden whom he hoped not to dishonor, whom he lusted not to destroy. I tell you he gloated on every heave of her swelling bosom, on every undulation of her limbs—not a movement, not a turn of her figure could escape him. By the God whom I worship, my soul burned to slay him where he sat. Let him come here again, and a shaft from this bow that never misses, shall drown the flames of his accursed lust in his black heart's blood!” “Nay! nay, my friend, and soon to be my brother, be not rash, Orozimbo. I trust thou art too hasty I trust that, in this at least, thou art too suspicious. But if it were so, if it were as thou thinkest, dost imagine that I—I, Hernando de Leon—would leave to any other man alive, were that other the Cid Ruy Diaz of Bivar, the right of avenging a wrong offered to my promised wife—the privilege of shedding his life blood that dared but to look on her too warmly? No! no! believe me, Orozimbo, if it be so, he dies upon this blade which twice has beaten death back from the gates of his existence! But not a word of this—not a word, on thy life, to Guarica! I will myself speak with Don Guzman, when I return to-morrow. I think he will not dare, even if he should wish it, to show aught but respectful courtesy to my promised bride.” “It shall be done as you wish, Hernando,” answered the youth, “but beware of him. Certain am I, that he is no true man, or honest friend; and for the rest, he knows even now, as well as I do, that you daily visit Guarica; though it may be he fancies her your paramour, and not your destined wife. But, as I said, beware of him, and let him beware of me; for as surely as there is a God, who witnesses our thoughts, as clearly as our actions, so surely will I shoot him, like a dog, if I catch him lurking about her. And now go on your way to Guarica—she waits for you.” “And you, Orozimbo?” “I will pursue these men until I house them fairly, that I may learn to a foot the path in which they travel; for by that same path will they return again.” “No violence, my friend, promise me that there shall be no violence.” “I do,” replied the Charib, laying his tawny hand on his bare bosom; “I do promise you. Why should I harm them until I am certain? I am not quite so mad as that, Senor Hernando.” “Then go—it is as well thou shouldst—and keep good watch; for I am ordered hence with a detachment to the new fortress eastward, and shall be absent seven days, or perhaps longer. Watch over her while I am gone; for if he dare attempt aught, it will be then—though I think it not of him.” “Ordered hence—ha! ordered away!” cried the boy; “when was that? When did you hear of that? Are you sure he had naught to do with it?” “The order was conveyed to me this morning from my superiors. Don Guzman had no voice in it, save as one of the council; besides it is a high and honorable post! Farewell, and be thou prudent; ere I set forth I will seek occasion to hold converse with him. Good night, and fare thee well, if thou return not to the cottage ere I leave it.” And shaking hands kindly with the young and gallant Indian, he cantered forward, full of high hopes and tender dreams, to join his beautiful Guarica; while, with the patient and doglike sagacity of his race, her brother set himself to track out inch by inch, the route of those strangers, from whose visit his suspicions feared so much of evil. But though Hernando, partly from a reluctance to admit himself the possibility of such a surmise, and still more from a prudent apprehension of wakening the fiery soul of the Charib boy to some deed of signal vengeance, the consequence of which might be to cause a war of extermination between the races; but though Hernando had expressed his confidence so strongly in the good faith of Herreiro, that confidence, as he rode onward in deep self-communion, began to wane; and if not quite extinguished, was much weakened before he reached the dwelling of his lady love, and in her witching smile forgot all thought of peril. As soon as Orozimbo left him, he began to reflect within himself upon the altered conduct of Don Guzman; for he could not deny to his own heart that it was altered strangely. From having been at one time his most constant and familiar comrade, he now remembered that for many weeks past Herreiro had avoided him; and, if compelled by the routine of duty to exchange a few words with him, had done so hurriedly, and without any longer pause than was necessary. When he thought upon this, he began naturally enough to think upon the reason why he, so late the idol of his friends and fellow soldiers, should have now earned their suspicion and dislike. Nor could he but confess that in some sort the fault had been his own—that he had been so utterly engrossed by his passion for the princess, as to neglect all else except his duty—and almost that also! Nor could he wonder that his own sudden alienation from the pastimes and pursuits of his associates, should have given rise in them not only to a like alienation, but to a feeling of resentment and distrust, and perhaps even of hatred, ever the child of irritated vanity. He struck his hand on his breast with a gloomy feeling of self-condemnation “Alas!” he muttered to himself—“Alas! how often do even our best feelings lead us astray—how often do we by our own first injustice towards others beget that injustice towards ourselves of which we afterwards so bitterly complain! But I will speak with him to-morrow, ere I start; I will speak with him openly and frankly, and all shall be well. And now for Guarica.” By this time he had traversed the tract of forest land, and reached the edge of the lone savannah, whence he could mark the cottage home of his beloved, o'ercanopied by its tall palms and feathery mimosas; the moon was hanging like a lamp of silver in the serene and cloudless sky, wherein a thousand glorious constellations unknown to our colder hemispheres were burning with a clear and deathless lustre, undimmed by any mist or earthly vapor. Myriads of fire-flies were glancing in the thick foliage of the trees, or flitting to and fro over the dewy grass—perfumes were steaming up from every herb and flower, and the light air that fanned the face of the young Spaniard was loaded with a rich and spicy fragrance, almost too powerful for the senses. There was a hum of melody upon the soft night breeze, the blended voices of ten thousand small nocturnal insects, but sweeter, clearer, more melodious far than all swelled up from the distant cottage, the pure voice of young womanhood, rising in notes of sacred song to the very throne of Holiness. The young man paused to listen with a soul thrilling with delight—it was the hymn to the Vir gin, and though the intermediate words were lost in distance, the burden Ave Purissim pealed in her clear and silvery accents high as the swell of a seraphic trumpet. While he yet stood and listened, the light, which beamed fair and uninterrupted from the casement of Guarica's chamber, was suddenly obscured, and he might see the slight and exquisite proportions of the fair girl pencilled distinct and sharp, against the glowing background, as she stood looking out into the night awaiting his approach, who, though unseen, was so nigh to her. He gave his horse the spur, and in five minutes was beside her. It is not in the power of words to describe such meetings. Those who have loved, as did the young Hernando, fervently, wildly, passionately (yet withal so chastely and so purely that his most ardent wish had called no blush to the chariest maiden's cheek), can remember, can conceive. To all beside, the high and holy aspirations, the sweet blending of those kindred souls, is a sealed book; and sealed it must remain, until to them, too, love shall give the key. Suffice it they were happy; as happy as aught of mortal mould may be. No thought of care or evil came nigh them: lapped in the dreams of young romance—absorbed in their unselfish, fond affection—they had no thoughts but of the blissful present—no hopes but of a blessed future. Long they sat, hand in hand, in that serene and tranquil happiness, which is too deep, too full of thought, to find vent in many words; and afterwards, long they conversed of their future prospects, anticipating the arrival of the great and good Columbus, who was soon hourly expected to return from Old Spain, and whose consent alone, and presence, they awaited, in order to be made one in the sight of man and God. The night was wearing late, and the slight meal of fruits, and cake, and sweet palm wine had been tasted, yet not once had Guarica ever thought of mentioning the visit of her lover's countrymen; nor had Hernando found courage yet to tell her that seven days must elapse before he should again behold her. But now, when the time had arrived to say farewell, and he was forced reluctantly to tell her all—reluctantly, not only that it was painful to himsell to dwell even on his temporary absence—but that he could not bear to see those sweet eyes swim in tears, that charming bosom swell with the sob of suppressed agony —now, in the agitation and the anguish of that parting moment, the fears, which she had that day for the first time experienced, came back upon her, dark and gloomy. And, hanging on Hernando's shoulder, she owned, even while she strove to smile at her own weak and womanish dismay—she confessed that she, too, had read in the dark eye of Guzman, she knew not what, that had filled her soul with harrowing dread; with forebodings such as she never had entertained, or thought of before; which had hung all the evening like a heavy storm cloud darkening her very soul; and which, though banished for a space by his presence, had again returned, sadder, and heavier, and darker than before. It was in vain that Hernando argued with her, as he had argued with her brother; that he used every faculty of his powerful mind to convince, to soothe, to reassure her—it was in vain—she would not be consoled. “I know it,” she said, in reply to all that he could urge; “I feel it here, and I know it will be so—I know that the time of my trial is at hand. God grant me strength to pass through it stainless and unscathed—but I foresee my peril, and the quarter whence it cometh. I know that you must leave me—I would not have you stay, or loiter—no, not to save my life: for what should you be, with your soldier's honor tarnished—or what would be left for me, if I should tempt you to dishonor? No! my beloved, no!—You must begone, and leave Guarica to her trials and her God! Pray for me, my beloved, pray for me—and oh! whatever shall fall out, be well assured of this —that never will Guarica survive her honor, or her love for De Leon. Farewell, then, dear Hernando; but, ere you go, grant me one boon—will you not, dearest?—the first boon Guarica ever asked of her Hernando?” “Can you ask if I will, Guarica? Take anything—take all! my life, my very soul is thine. What shall I give thee, dearest? “This!” said the girl, laying her hand on the hilt of a small, slight, though long stiletto, with a square blade, scarce thicker than a lady's bodkin, which he wore in a golden scabbard at his girdle—“give me this only!” “Nay! nay! this were an ominous gift, Guarica; ask anything but this.” “Will you refuse me my first prayer, Hernando?” “I would not willingly refuse—but there is an ancient saw about sharp-edged gifts. I am not superstitious, and yet—and yet—I will own the truth—I do not like to give it!” “Then will I buy it of you: what shall I give? See,” she confinued, smiling, “the other day you asked me for a lock of hair: give me the dagger quick, and you shall have it!” And with the words she drew it from the sheath, and severed a long, silky ringlet. “Give me the scabbard, now, and you shall have this—and—” “And what, Guarica?” “And what you never would have dared to ask of me.” And she cast down her eyes; and a quick blush shot across her sunny features; and a visible thrill shook her frame, as if she half repented the words she had uttered. “A kiss, Guarica?” She raised her eyes again, timidly but unshrinkingly, to meet her lover's ardent gaze: “You will not think me overbold or unmaidenly, Hernando?” “You! you unmaidenly, Guarica!—the saints in heaven as soon!” And as he spoke, he unlinked the jewelled scabbard from his girdle, and laying it in her hand, folded her for one moment in his arms, and printed one long, chaste kiss, on lips that returned not the pressure. “But for what can you want such a keepsake, dearest?—what will you do with it?” he asked, as he released her. “Wear it next to my heart,” she answered, her soft eye lightening with a bright, enthusiastic inspiration, and her whole form appearing to dilate with energy and soul. “Now I am mistress of myself—now I am mistress of my honor!” “Lovely enthusiast!—and thinkest thou thou couldst find the courage or the strength to use it?” “Think I—think I, Hernando? No! I think not—I know it. Should that man dare to wrong me, so surely as I hope to live in heaven hereafter, where he stood, there should he die by a girl's hand; or, if that should fail, I have a heart myself, that lies not so deep but this would reach it. Now, I am happy, love —now I am strong and fearless. Fare thee well—fare thee well, Hernando, and dread nothing. Spotless you leave me now, and loving, and spotless you shall find me, aye! and loving, whether it be on earth or there!” and she pointed with the gleaming dagger to the calm, azure heavens, as she spoke, in a voice so tranquilly harmonious, and with an air of majesty so perfect, that Hernando almost asked himself whether she were not a being of nature too pure and ethereal to be the object of mere mortal love, and fitter for man's adoration as a guardian saint or angel. “Beautiful, glorious creature!” he exclaimed, almost involuntarily, “it will be needless all; there lives no man on earth daring enough to dream of harming thee; and if there were, the Lord, who watches over all his virtuous creatures, would surely send down legions of thy kindred angels to defend thee!” “Hernando!” “Guarica! sweet Guarica! Farewell!” And the young lovers parted. Sad word, alas!—sad thought. For who that part can dream when they shall meet again, or what shall pass before that meeting? CHAPTER IV. Morning had dawned already, when Hernando returned to the fortress of his countrymen, and all was noise and bustle; two companies were under arms without the gates, and the whole esplanade between the walls and the sea was alive with men rolling down casks of ammunition or provisions to a tall caravella, which lay in the little basin at the wharf, with her foretopsail loose, in readiness to sail, as it seemed, at a moment's notice. As Hernando dismounted, two or three officers, who were inspecting the arquebusers and pikemen, stepped forward to salute him. “How soon will the tide serve, Señor Gomez?” asked the young cavalier, addressing the personage who had accompanied Herreiro on the previous day. “Not for two hours, at the earliest, Don Hernando,” replied the sailor; “but I am waiting only to have the soldiers put on board, before I shove off into the stream.” “I will give orders—I will give orders. How soon shall you want me on board?” “My boat shall wait you in an hour at the port stairs.” “I will be ready, senor. Don Luis Mandragone, get your men on board instantly. Steadily, sir! steadily! no hurry! Forward, march!” And for a few moments he stood still, observing the movements of the troops, who, with that steadiness of severe discipline which rendered the Spanish infantry the most famous in the world, went through the requisite manœuvres with equal speed and facility. This done, Hernando turned to the sentinels on duty, and inquired if Don Guzman de Herreiro was within the walls, but, greatly to his disappointment, he was answered in the negative; and, on making further inquiries, still more to his vexation, he was informed that, although he had not returned home till a late hour on the previous evening, he had set out, alone, to hunt before daybreak. Not a word did De Leon utter in reply, but his brow grew as black as night, and he strode away, hastily, to his own barrack, and locking himself in, to avoid interruption, took pen and paper, and addressed a long letter to his whilom friend and comrade. For he was not deceived in the least by the pretext of hunting; knowing, as he did, that Herreiro was by no means so ardent an admirer of field sports, as to get up before the sun two following mornings, to ride after the stanchest hounds that ever opened upon game. He doubted not, therefore, that, whatever the pretence, his Guarica, his own betrothed, was the true object of pursuit to a man, whom he knew bold, resolute, voluptuous, unscrupulous, and persevering. It was a moment of strange agony! For though he never so much dreamed of doubting Guarica's purity of soul, or power to resist more potent fascinations than were like to be brought against her—though he imagined not that Herreiro would dare resort to violence—still it was anguish to believe that she, his soul's idol, would have to endure the solicitations, to brook the insolent addresses of this bold libertise. It was now that he felt bitterly the folly of his conduct, in so estranging himself from his comrades: for he had no one to whom he could confide his anxieties, of whom he could ask comfort and advice. The rather that the very man to whom it would have been most natural that he should apply, was he against whom he was now called upon to take counsel. Short was the space which was left to him, either for action or deliberation, and perhaps it was well for him that it was so; for assuredly, under the spur of instant necessity, he took a course which, if the boldest, was the wisest he could have adopted. He sat down and wrote a long, frank letter to Herreiro, as one devoted friend to another. He apologized in some sort for his late strangeness and allenation, by accounting for it; which he did—ingenuously, frankly, truly. He wrote to him of Guarica, as if he were ignorant that Herreiro knew of her existence: he told him of his first fascination, of his deep love arising thence, of his intention to make her his wife, immediately on the return of Columbus; and then, touching on his compulsory absence from Isabella, he commended his mistress to the care of his friend, in all loyalty and honor; conjuring him to watch over her, to protect her in case of any peril, to be to her, in short, if necessity should arise, as a brother. This packet finished, and confided to the charge of Don Guzman's confidential servant, —which was not done until the hour of embarkation was at hand,—Hernando's mind was more composed and tranquillized than it had been since his discovery of Herreiro's conduct. “He cannot,” thought he, within himself, “after receiving this—he cannot dream of prosecuting any dishonorable suit towards my destined wife First, I cannot believe his heart so treacherously base and evil: second, he dare not; for he knows that, did he so, within six hours of my return, he would have ceased to draw the breath of life: and third, as gentleman and belted knight, he dare not meet the obloquy and scorn of every honorable man, which would burst on his head should he despise this frank and loyal trust.” And in this renewed confidence, he stepped on board the boat that was to bear him to the stately caravella; and as he climbed her castellated prow, and stood upon her guarded deck, with the free, fair breeze laughing in her shrouds and halyards, and the blue waves of the bright Caribbean rippling and gurgling round her bows, sorrow, and care, and sad anticipation passed from his heart, as a cloud is swept away by the autumnal wind from the face of some rich champaign, and in their place the sunshine of ambition, and blithe energetic action, possessed the spirit of the adventurous soldier. So true it is, that for man, however deeply and devotedly he love, that love is still but the amusement, the luxury, if you will, of his existence; while, on the contrary, to a woman it is the necessity of life—nay, it is life itself. It certainly is not possible that any man on earth could have loved more sincerely, more fervently, than Hernando; and yet, from the instant when the brave frigate left her moorings, spreading sheet after sheet of snowy canvas to the favoring breeze, and dashing the small seas asunder in jets of flashing spray, not a thought of anxiety or sadness came to disturb him, or, if it did, it was banished by an effort of strong will, as being, if not unmanly, at least inconsistent with his bolder duties. Fair blew the breezes, and rapidly the good ship sped before it, and the cheer of the stout mariners, and the jest and song of the idle soldiery, to whom this summer voyage was a gay holiday of rest from the monotonous routine of the garrison, made merry, though rough music Action and bustle, and perhaps strife—enthusiastic, thrilling strife before them—the walls of Isabella ere long sunk on their lee, and they, and all that they contained, were soon forgotten. But in the forest-home of poor Guarica there was no keen excitement, no hurried action, to banish heavy shadows from the heart—no change of scene to divert the weary eyes from thoughts forgotten by the sight of familiar objects. No new, strange sounds to distract the ear, filled as it were with old memories, recalled at every moment by old, accustomed noises. There she sat in her wonted chamber, where he had so lately sat beside her, gazing upon the same sweet landscape which so often they had admired together—now turning to the books which he had given her, now trying to distract her sorrows by singing, to his mandolin, the Spanish airs which he had taught her. But all would not do; the one dread thought, the one dread terror, sat on her heart, haunted her as with a real presence—the fixed presentiment of evil—evil from that dark, terrible Don Guzman. And, as if to increase the weight of that terror, it chanced that Orozimbo, who, fearful as herself of some deep laid and treacherous stratagem, had resolved to devote the whole time of Hernando's absence to watching over Guarica—was called away at dawn that very morning, with every vassal he could muster, to attend a general council of the tribe, convened by Caonabo, whose mandate, as his uncle and his chief, he neither dared dispute nor could resist. Again, therefore, was she left alone with her maidens, to whom, knowing the inutility of awakening their terrors fruitlessly, she had confided nothing of her apprehensions. The day, however, passed, until the sun had buried his lower limb in the green summit of the tall forest which encompassed the savanuah; and no alarm had occurred, nor any sound come from the neighboring woodlands, to denote the vicinity of any stranger. The lapse of time, as it ever will, bred something of security, and she began to reprove herself with cowardly and shameful weakness, and to endeavor to convince herself that, as Hernando had assured her, Don Guzman's visit must have been purely accidental. It wanted, perhaps, two hours, or nearly three of the true sunset, although the shadows of the woods were already cast in level lines of purple over the smooth savannah, when her girls came in to announce to her that they were going down to bear the cotton cloths they had been spinning to the bleach ground beside the brook. Once, for a moment, it occurred to her to retain one of the girls near her person, but with a smile at her own cowardice, she changed her mind, and suffered them to leave her all alone, reflecting, as she did so, that if danger should arise, they could afford her little or no protection; and again, that should she be alarmed, a moment would carry her to the spot where they were assembled. She sat still, therefore, for a space, listening to the gay sound of their laughing voices, until they wre lost in the distance: and then, although she held a volume of some high Spanish poet in her hand, she fell into a reverie, which lasted till the purple hues of evening were gradually stealing towards the zenith. She had just, partially aroused from her meditation, begun to marvel at the long tarrying of the girls, when she felt, rather than saw, for her eyes were lowered to the ground, that some one had passed the window near which she was sitting. At the next moment a footstep, which her quick Indian ear told her was a man's, and a European's, fell heavily upon the portico. Instinctively her hand glanced down to the hilt of the stiletto which she wore, as she had said she would, next to her heart, within her muslin and robe, and as she loosened the keen weapon in the sheath, a high and flashing smile illuminated her dark features. At the same moment, the tall form of Dou Guzman de Herreiro stood on the threshold of the door. He was dressed in a full suit of black cloth, with hat, plumes, mantle of the same color, and the swift eye of the girl perceived instantly that he was heavily, almost, indeed, ostentatiously armed—for in addition to the long Toledo blade which hung at his left side, and the heavy dagger which counterbalanced it, he had a pair of horseman's pistols at his belt, so large and cumbrous that they would appear almost out of place in holsters at the saddle-bow. He did not speak a word, but, removing the hat from his high, pale brow, stood gazing at her with an eye so fixed and baleful, that it seemed almost as if he believed he could fascinate her. And she rose instantly, and faced him, tranquil and calm, and, though paler than usual, firm and untrembling. Then stepping one pace forward, and extending his hand, as if to take hers, which hung by her side motionless, he said in tones of affected softness— “Well, my sweet princess of the forest, happy am I, again, to find you all alone.” “Don Guzman de Herreiro,” she replied, still confronting him with a quiet eye, and rejecting his hand, as though she bad not perceived that he offered it—“Don Guzman de Herreiro will perhaps condescend to explain the motives that have led him to this intrusion. There is no storm to-night, nor has the chase, I think, this time led him hither?” “You know me, then—you know me,” exclaimed the Spaniard, a bright color for a moment kindling his sallow features. “Fortunate that, my sweet Guarica; for it will save the awkwardness of introductions.” “I do know you, senor,” the young girl answered steadily, “and when you have answered me my question, you shall know me, which I now perceive you do not.” “Your question,” said Herreiro, with an air half forgetful and half supercilious; “Aye! why I have come hither, is it not?—to see you, then, my beauty. It is your grace, your charms, that have brought me hither—” “And for what end, I pray you, or to what purpose?” “These things, sweet one,” he answered, carelessly, “are, perhaps, explained better by deeds than by words; some little time, and a few soft attentions, make all that clear and simple, which, if told bluntly, might alarm your sex's charming sensibility.” “I prayed you yesterday, senor, to spare yourself the trouble of paying me these fine compliments, as they are merely thrown away I will now add, that if they be meant as serious gallantry, they are, if possible, more useless than when regarded as mere figurative flourishes, employed to keep your tongue in tune.” “So scornful—ah! so young and beautiful, and so contemptuous withal.” “How should I be other than scornful?” answered Guarica, still perfectly unmoved, “when your addresses can be regarded only as mockery or as insult.” “Insult—you err—sweet Guarica. What if I come to lay my heart in all honor at your feet—to say to you frankly—” “Were that the case—which it is not,” she answered, “as frankly would I tell you, that I cannot accept your heart, having none to bestow on you in return.” “Again, what if I were to say that it is not your heart, but your beauty—” “Senor!” “That overlooking all past frailties, all tenderness of the heart towards one—” “To put a stop to all this matter at once,” she interrupted him, speaking very rapidly, and with a marked and thrilling emphasis, “I will fill up your sentence. To one, you say— to Don Hernando de Leon, say I, whose promised bride I am. You will see now the propriety of urging me no further. Don Guzman, you are answered. If that you be a gentleman, you will leave me.” “And do you really think, my angel, that I believe such nonsense—that I even suppose you to believe it? De Leon's paramour, if you love the title, and much honor you do to his good taste—but his wife—his wife—ha! ha! you make me laugh. By heavens! you make me laugh, Guarica!” And with the word he advanced a little way towards her; but she exclaimed in a clear high note, that pierced his ear like the blast of a silver trumpet— “Stand back! stand back! I say not if you be a gentleman—you, who are recreant to every law of Spanish chivalry or knightly honor! You, who are false to your noble comrade's trust! you, traitor and knave and liar!—I say not, if you be a man, for nothing worthy the name of man would so insult and outrage a helpless solitary girl! But still, I say, stand back! Back! not for shame, or honesty, or honor! but for fear! Back! lest, when he return, Hernando scourge you like a vile cur as you are, scourge you before the face of your chivalric countrymen!” “A fair defiance, lovely Guarica, a fair but dangerous defiance. Never, if you will be advised by me, taunt a man on his personal courage. You are a brave girl to defy me thus, when you are at my mercy, when you are alone.” “I am not at your mercy. I am not alone!” “Not at my mercy? not alone? But you know not that I have watched my time—that I am thoroughly aware, that, save we two, there is no living creature within earshot!” “I care not how you may have watched, I care not what you know—I am not at your mercy? I am not alone!” “As how, sweet beauty? By heaven! your daring lends fresh lustre to your loveliness!” “I am the mistress of myself, and God is with me.” “See, then,” said Herreiro, sneeringly, “if God will aid you. Come, girl, wilt grant to love, what thou perforce must yield to violence?” Her lips moved rapidly, but no sound reached his ear. Her eyes were turned upward. But her right hand was firmly clasped within the bosom of her robe. “Come, Guarica, be wise—resistance is in vain—submit me—” “Beware thou! I will not submit thee!” And she stood pale and motionless as marble, but as firm at the same time, and almost as fearless. Maddened by passion, and excited almost to frenzy by her scornful bearing, he sprang to seize her; his right hand had already clutched her left arm, as it hung by her side, his left was flung about her waist, when, in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, the spell was broken—the blood rushed in a torrent, to brow, cheek, neck, and bosom of the pale statue, her eye flashed fiery indignation, her right hand sprang into the air, the keen blade of Hernando's dagger glittering through the dusky twilight. “Die!” she cried; “ravisher and villain— die in thy sin and shame!” And with a quick and fiery energy that made up for the want of strength, she smote him three times in the bosom with the speed of light, that the strong man let go his hold, and staggered back a pace or two, like one who has received a mortal wound. Yet Guarica knew that the villain was unwounded, for every blow that she dealt him had jarred her slight arm to the shoulder, as the point of her weapon glanced from the secret chain mail which Herreiro wore beneath his doublet. Had the blade been of less perfect temper it had been shivered to the hilt. As it was, it had not lost one iota of its trenchant keenness, and, as she started back, she coolly tried its point with her finger. “Best leave me, senor!” she exclaimed. “From me you can gain nothing, even on terms more shameful to your manhood!” “You are mistaken, girl!” he replied, fiercely, for he was no coward, and his blood was up. “Your God will no more aid you, than will your foolish bodkin pierce my good Spanish mail. Prepare yourself for the worst. It is now pride and vengeance. Look to yourself—your will find no mercy!” “I expect none,” she answered, and as he rushed towards her, his eyes glowing and his cheeks flushed with fiendish passion, she added, looking up towards heaven—“Yet I am mistress of myself! come one step nearer, and by the God whom thou dost not believe, and who shall yet smite thee in thy unbelief—in my own heart I plunge this dagger, and on thy head be the blood and the curse!” And with the word she tore away the cotton robe that scarce restrained her panting bosom, and raised the long keen blade aloft with proud determination. “My flesh will hardly turn the point, which thy mail armor scarce resisted!” He read it in her firm and compressed lip, he noted it in the steadfast gaze of her earnest eye, he heard it in every note of her clear, composed, and unfaltering voice—that resolution, fixed and sure as death. He knew by the concentrated energy and force with which she had stricken him, that no weakness of her woman arm would mar her purpose in the execution. He was foiled, and he knew it—foiled and defeated by a girl—a savage!” Unable to persist in his base intent, unwilling to retreat, he stood infirm of purpose, speechless, and vacillating. At length he faltered forth— “Bravely played! bravely played, on my soul! Guarica, it could not have been done better had we been both in earnest, which—ha! ha! ha! it makes me laugh! ha! ha! it does, by St. Jago! which I believe you really thought I was. Come, confess—confess, noble Guarica, didst thou not think that I was in earnest?” “Didst thou think that I was?” replied Guarica, with a smile of contempt and loathing. “Well is it for thee that thou wearest a coat of proof when thou playest these merry jests— else had my dagger and thy heart's blood been acquainted. Yes! senor,” she continued, changing her tone of bitter scorn into an accent of deliberate and firm assertion. “Yes, senor, I do believe, or rather I do know that you were in earnest, and on this night, seven days hence, we will see what Hernando de Leon will believe touching it. And now, senor, you offered me some advice awhile since, which I will repay by offering some to you in turn. Betake yourself to your horse as quickly as you may; I hear my maidens' voices coming hitherward, it may be there are men with them.” “To hell with your counsel, minion!” cried Herreiro, perceiving himself now thoroughly detected, and yielding to his furious hate and disappointed malice. “You think yourself invincible, because this time you have baffled me—but patience! patience! and the time will come! and hark you, girl! on that same day whereon Hernando learns what has passed this night, on that same day he dies! Ha! do I touch you? Tell him, fool, tell him, and you seal his death-warrant!” “Ha! ha!” shrilly laughed Guarica, and sneeringly. “It is my time, now—my time to laugh!” she cried. “Nay, 'twould make dumb things laugh to hear you threaten—you, and him!” Enraged beyond endurance by her taunts, he had half drawn a pistol from his belt—would he have had the baseness to aim it at a woman's life?—when the quick tread of many men was heard without—then! then, for the first time, when aid was close at hand, and terror causeless, Guarica's courage failed her— she uttered one long shriek—the revulsion of her feelings was too much for her, she fell to the ground fainting. One bound carried Herreiro clear through the open window—his horse stood close at hand—he was upon his back, the spur in his side, the bridle lifted, when the loud charib war-cry pealed around him, and a long arrow, shot in haste and aimlessly, whistled close by his ear. The good horse stretched into his gallop— another and another shaft just grazed him harmless—he was safe—safe by a few short yards alone, so furiously did the revengeful Charibs, headed by Orozimbo, press the chase. And so long and so stanchly did they keep it up, that when he crossed the echoing drawbridge, and stood in safety within the battlemented walls of Isabella, the dark forms of the Indian runners were visible on the savannah, at a short half mile's distance; and their loud yells and whoops were heard fearfully distinct in the quiet night. CHAPTER V. Day after day passed onward, but no more did Guarica hear or see of Don Guzman de Herreiro; for not only did he not again venture to approach her forest home, but not once did he quit the guarded precincts of the fortress. And well was it for him he did not. Perhaps, indeed, it was a secret instinct that taught him to conceal himself within the barrack square, a consciousness that wrong, so deadly as he had mediated to the forest princess, could not be offered with impunity. Bold as he was, and daring in the battle field, perhaps his heart failed him when he thought of lurking foes concealed in every brake, waiting with all the deadly patience of Indian revenge, to wing the fatal arrow to his heart—and well was it for him. For from the very hour in which Orozimbo had tracked him to the fortress, saved only by the fleetness of his charger, from that very hour not ten steps could he have made beyond the drawbridge, without encountering death beyond a peradventure. Day and night, fair and foul, the wakeful Charibs lay concealed around; never was there a moment when one at least of Orozimbo's men was not within easy arrow range of the castle gates. One watching while another slept, one feeding while another fasted, constantly, resolutely, was the ward kept—the watch and ward of vengeance. Yet with such skilful subtilty, with such deep craft was it all ordered, that though Herreiro might have met his spies on the look out, he could have learned or suspected nothing. The watcher now would be a solitary fisherman playing his scoop-net at the basin's mouth; now a wild hunter offering his game for sale to the officers; now a group of old Indians with palm and wine and fruits, and now a knot of striplings playing or wrestling on the green before the esplanade; but each and all with bow and quiver at his back, eyeing furtively but keenly the form of every passer, each and all ready and alert to avenge the insult offered to their young princess. Nor while the gates of Isabella were thus formidably guarded and beset, was Guarica again left unprotected or alone. Whenever Orozimbo was abroad, and he was now abroad more frequently than ever, for it appeared that something new and strange was in the wind, armed musters being held almost nightly of Caonabo's vassals, whenever Orozimbo was abroad, two or three stalwart Indians might be seen at some point or other within sight and earshot of the cottage, while others were on the scout constantly among the woods, through which a foe must pass to reach the dwelling of Guarica. That something was on foot among the savages, as they were still termed by the Spaniards, could not be doubted. The great Lord of the Golden House had mustered all his warriors; and many subjects of the four other independent caciques of the Island, who, more timid or less patriotic than the heroic Caonabo, shrank from collision with the whites, were gathered to the banners of the champion of his people. This was especially the case with the tribemen of the queen Anacaona. Invariably the friend of the white men herself, she had inculcated the like pacific notions into the minds of her kinsmen; so that Orozimbo and Guarica had been scarce second to their aunt in good will to the pale invaders. The fiery blood of the young Indian had been, however, so thoroughly aroused by the atrocious outrage offered to his sister, that he had joined heart and hand with his warlike kinsman, who had determined on a simultaneous onslaught upon every Spanish post, previous to the return of the great Admiral. Not a few of the best and boldest of his tribes were united with him, but knowing well the predilection of his aunt and sister for the European colonists, all had been carefully concealed from them. While Orozimbo satisfied his conscience as to the consequences of his conduct on his sister's fate, by charging all his followers to respect the person of Hernando, and preserve him at all hazards, and by obtaining a pledge of his safety from the great cacique. Such was the state of things when De Leon returned from his mission, late in the afternoon of the seventh day from his parting with Guarica. The plans of Caonabo were all laid and determined; but the day and hour on which the attack should be made he still kept buried in his own bosom, lest once known to his people, treason, or drunkenness—for, since the coming of the white men this curse likewise was entailed upon the Indian—or careless indiscretion might betray it to the foe. Even Orozimbo knew no more than the meanest of his tribes-men; night after night every inferior chief was ordered to hold all his men in readiness, though none knew for what; and night after night, up to the evening of Hernando's coming, each had received a mandate instructing him to disband his people until the following moon-rise. Scarce had Hernando disembarked from his caravella, ere he hurried to the quarters of Don Guzman, expecting to receive a solution of all his doubts and surmises. But when he reached his door, he was, to his extreme astonishment, refused admittance, on the pretence that Herreiro had been very ill and confined to his bed during the whole period of his, Hernando's absence, and that the leech had forbidden strictly that any person should have access to him. Frustrated thus, he inquired of the servant whether the packet he had left on the morning of his departure was delivered—to which question the man answered promptly, as it afterwards appeared truly, that it was—that he gave it to his master, on his return from hunting, the same day on which he received it; although, he added, that he knew not whether Don Guz man had read it, having been taken ill within an hour or two of his return, in consequence, it was supposed, of a sun-stroke. Having exhausted thus every source of information that was open to him, Hernando, after making his report to the commandant, and receiving his conge for the night, ordered his horse to be prepared immediately, and rode away into the forest, taking his bloodhounds with him. In the meantime the officers were revelling in the mess-room, with cards, and dice, and wine, and dark-haired Indian women; the sentinels were slumbering or drinking at their posts; the cannon were unloaded; the walls almost unguarded. Riot and luxury within, and relaxed discipline; and without armed foes, thirsty for blood and vengeance. So stood affairs when Hernando galloped from the gates, fearless and free of heart, and full of bright and gay anticipation. The very news he had received from Herreiro's servant resassured him—for it had not occurred to him to doubt its truth. So that, secure in his imagination that Guarica could have been troubled by no fresh intrusion, he rode joyously along the forest track, in all the confidence of happy and successful love. He was surprised a little, it is true, at meeting, three times on his road, an armed Indian, apparently on the scout; such a thing never having previously happened in all the times he had come and gone to and fro. But the men, all of whom happened to be acquainted with his person, spoke to him pleasantly, and passed on their way; and Hernando, indeed, almost forgot that he had seen them, until, when he saw Guarica, and she related to him, amid tears of gratitude and joy, all that had happened, he perceived and appreciated the object of the wise precaution. Fierce and tremendous was his indignation, as, without a touch of fear at the foul menace of Herreiro, the fair girl related to him the whole of that thrilling scene; but so much more were his love and admiration kindled towards the heroic maiden, that his ire smouldered in his bosom as quietly as though he had entertained no such feeling. So much so that Guarica herself almost wondered that, with so much cause for violent and quick resentment, her lover's mood should be softer, calmer, and more tranquil than its wont. Little she knew that the current of fierce wrath, when stillest, is ever deadliest and deepest. Little she fancied that Hernando's spirits were so gay and lightsome, his manner soft and unconcerned, because he saw his course of vengeance plain before him—because he knew that on the morrow his enemy must pay his debt even unto the uttermost farthing. After a little while, as is sometimes the case with all of us, when our spirits are enkindled and our sensibilities aroused far beyond their wont, the atmosphere of the airy room in which the lovers sat appeared to them confined and oppressive, their souls seemed to want scope to expand—they panted for the free air of the wide, starry heavens, and forth they strolled, arm-in-arm, through the quiet moonlight, across the beautiful savannah—across the little brook, dry-shod upon the snow-white stepping-stones —and thence along the forest's edge whence first Hernando had beheld her. That, since their loves had grown into maturity, had been to them a hallowed place— aud on the streamlet's bank, just the spot where he had forced his Andalusian steed to leap it, De Leon's hands had built a rustic seat, beneath the shelter of a huge palm tree, and close to the verge of the unbroken forest. Thither they bent their steps, led by some secret mutual impulse, and there they sat down, side by side, in happiness too deep to find vent in many words. It was Guarica who spoke first, and when she did, it was of the subject that was ever foremost in her mind, the villany and treason of Don Guzman. But she struck no responsive string in Hernando's mind; and he spoke wide of the mark, making some passing observation touching the beauty of the night. “But let us speak,” she said, “of this Herreiro: think you that he will dare attempt his menaced vengeance?” “His vengeance, paltry knave!” said Hernando, scornfully. “No! but let him dread mine—for it shall find him out before he dream of it; nor shall his feigned distemper save him! But let us think of him no further. He is not worth one instant's care. The viper is but perilous so long as we suspect him not; once seen, he is so harmless, that it is scarce worth the while to crush him, and, for the rest, it will be but a little space—a little space, which we must bear with patience—scarcely a week, I trust, my own and best beloved, before the good and great Columbus shall return; and then, then, sweet one, there will be an end to all your doubts, anxieties, and fears. He is the best, the noblest, the most just of men. He is my friend, too, and a tried one. He once returned, I will avow at once to him my love for my Guarica; his consent it is meet that we should have before our union, and of it I am certain! Then—then, thou shalt be mine, for ever mine, in the sight of men, as thou art now in the sight of Heaven and all its angels!” “My own Hernando!” was her sole answer, for her heart swelled as she spoke, and her passion was too strong for words, and two large diamond tears collected slowly on the long, silky fringes of her eyelids, and hanging there like dew-drops on the violet's petal, slid slowly down her soft, transparent cheeks. “Tears—tears, Guarica!” cried the lover, half reproachfully. “Can it be, can it be, that thou shalt doubt me?—me, who have never asked the slightest freedom—never essayed the smallest and most innocent familiarity; me, who would rather die—die, not on earth only, but for all eternity, than call up one chaste blush upon those maiden cheeks—than wake one doubt in that pure heart—than print one stain upon the whiteness of that virgin mind! Can it be—” “No! no!” exclaimed the girl, panting with eagerness to interrupt him, for he had spoken, hitherto, with such impetnous haste, that she had vainly sought to answer him. “No! no! Sooner would I doubt Heaven than thee. Hernando. They were tears, not of sorrow, not of doubt, but of pure, heart-felt joy! I know thou art the very soul of honor—I know thou wouldst ask nothing of thy Guarica that it would not be her pride, her joy, her duty, to bestow. It was but joy, dear, dear Hernando, to think that we would so soon be united beyond the power of man to part us.” Even as she spoke, while her cheek almost touched the face of her young lover,—for, in the intense excitement of the moment, she had leaned forward, clasping Hernando's hand in both her own, and watering it with her tears, —a sharp, keen twang, mixed with a clash, as if of steel, was heard behind them; a long, dark streak seemed to glare through the narrow space between their heads, with a low, whizzing sound, and on the instant a bolt, or arrow, stood quivering in the stem of a palm-tree opposite. To spring upon his feet, to whirl his long, two-edged Toledo from the scabbard, to dart, with a loud shout, into the thicket, calling upon his trusty hounds, which, quite unconscious of any peril, were slumbering at Guarica's feet, to whom they had become familiar guardians, was but an instant's work to the young and fiery Hidalgo. For at least ten minutes' space, he was absent from the Indian maiden; who, trembling with apprehension for the safety of him whom she had learned to love far more than life itself, with every tinge of color banished by mortal terror from her features, awaited his return. With every sense on the alert, eye, ear, and spirit on the watch, she stood in terrible excitement. She heard him crashing through the tangled brake; she heard his loud voice cheering the eager blood-hounds to track out the footsteps of his hidden foeman; but no bay of the sagacious animals, no clash of steel or answering defiance, fell on her anxious ear. His search was vain—his anxious labor fruitless—no fraying of the interlaced and thorny branches showed where the dastardly assassin had forced a passage for his retreating footsteps—no print in the clayey soil revealed where he had trodden; and, stranger yet, the keen scent of the sagacious dogs detected not the slightest taint upon the earth, or on the dewy herbage, although they quested to and fro, three hundred yards, at least, in circuit, around the tree wherein the well-aimed arrow stood—sure evidence of the murderer's intent. He returned, baulked and disappointed, to Guarica; big drops of icy perspiration standing, like bubbles, on his high, clear forehead, and his whole frame trembling with the agitatìon of strong excitement. “By Him who made me,” he exclaimed, as he returned to her, “this is most marvellous! there is not, nor hath been, within two hundred yards of us, a human being since we have sat here—if I may trust the sight of mine own eyes, or, what is truer far, the scent of my good hounds! Yet here,” he added, as he tore from the stem of the tall palm tree the short, massive bolt, with its four-cornered barbed steel head, “here is the evidence that one— and that, too, a Spaniard—hath been, or now is, close beside us. Come, dearest, come, let us leave this perilous spot. By Heaven! but it is wondrous strange!” In silence—for the girl was too full of terror, the cavalier, of dark and anxious thought, to enter into converse—he led her homeward. Across the bright savannah, gleaming in the moonlight, they reached, ere long, the portico of her loved home, and there, after a tender parting, Hernando vaulted into the saddle of his fiery Andalusian, whistled his faithful blood-hounds to his heel, and dashed away, at a furious gallop, towards the fortress of his unfriendly countrymen. Eager, still, to discover, if so it might be, something of him who had so ruthlessly aimed the murderer's shaft that night, Hernando rode directly to the spot where he had sat with Guarica when the fell missile was discharged: he saw the grass betraying, by its bruised and prostrate blades, the very spot by which they had been sitting; but all was still and lonely. Onward he went across the very ground which he had searched so carefully scarce half an hour before, and, ere he had traversed fifty paces, both bloodhounds challenged fiercely. Calling them instantly to heel, the cavalier alighted, bound his hot war-house to a tree, and eagerly scanned the soil. At the first glance, deep printed in the yielding mould, he found the clear print of a Spanish buskin, furnished with a long, knightly spur. To follow the trace backward was his first impulse; and scarce three minutes were consumed, before he tracked it to a tall and shadowy oak, the bark of which, scarred and defaced, showed that some person had, not long before, both climbed it and descended. “Ha!” he exclaimed, striking his breast with his clinched hand, “ha! idiot that I was, who thought not of this! It matters not, however; by God! it matters not; for right soon will I have him! Forward, good hounds,” he added, “forward, hark, halloa, ho! hark, forward!” And the vexed woodlands rang to the deep-mouthed dogs, and the hard gallop of the hunter. They reached the open ground, a league of forest having been already passed, and the hounds, for a moment, were at fault. Springing again to the earth, Hernando easily discovered, by the prints in the soil, that here the fugitive had taken horse—having, it would seem, left his charger under the keeping of a menial, while prosecuting his foul enterprise; for henceforth two broad horse-tracks might be seen running distinctly over the bare savannah homeward. Laying the hounds upon the horse-track, the cavalier again re-mounted, and the fresh dew aiding the scent, away they drove, at a pace almost unexampled, through brake and bush, over the open plain, athwart the murky covert—hill and hollow vanished beneath their fiery speed, rock and tree glanced by and disappeared, so furious was their pace; the deepest torrent turned him not, nor the most perilous leap deterred him—for the most fiery, the most constant, the most pervading of all human passions—deadly revenge, was burning his heart's core, turning the healthful currents of his blood to streams of fiery lava. The deadest hour of night had long been passed already, when he dashed forth upon that desperate race; the pale cold light of morning was streaning, broad but still, over the ramparts of the Spanish fortress, when Don Hernando de Leon pulled up his foaming steed before the drawbridge. Early, however, and untimely as was the hour, men were abroad already. A mounted servitor, in livery of Isabel and silver, riding a coal-black jennet, and leading by the bridle-rein a tall bay charger, trapped and housed richly with the same colors, was retiring from the gates, which were just closing, toward the barrack stables. Towards this steed, jaded and spent with toil, and all embossed with sweat and foam-flakes, and galled and bleeding at the flanks from cruel and incessant spurring, the savage blood-hounds, still in full cry, dashed without check or stint, and would have pulled the bay horse down had not the stern voice of their master checked them. He rode up to the groom, and in a deep voice, calm, slow, and perfectly unmoved, demanded, “Whose charger?” Without reply the servitor was hastening away, when he asked once again, in fiercer tones, drawing his dagger as he spoke— “Whose charger, dog? Speak, or thou diest! Whose charger? and who hath now dismounted from him? Not that I need thy voice to tell me what I already know, but that I choose to hear my knowledge confirmed by human words. Whose charger? “Don Guzman de Herreiro's,” replied the faltering menial; “he hath even now gone in— the bridge is not yet lifted.” “Excellent well!” replied the cavalier, “excellent well! Mine ancient comrade; excellent well! My fellow soldier, whose life I have thrice saved—once from the Moors, amid the mountain glens of Malaga, once from the surf, among the dread Antilles, and once here in this isle of Hispaniola, from the envenomed arrow of the Charib. Excellent well, Don Guzman!” In the meantime dismounting at the gates, he gave his charger and his hounds to the care of a favourite domestic who awaited him; and, with a firm, slow step, crossing the drawbridge, stopped for a moment to address the sentinel. “So,” he said, “old Gaspar, thou keepest good watch. When went Don Guzman forth?” “After we set the watch yestreen, fair sir,” replied the old Castilian, presenting, as he spoke, his partisan. “Now I bethink me, it was scarce five minutes after thou didst ride forth into the forest!” “And he hath now returned?” “But now.” No further words were interchanged; the young knight slowly passed across the courtyard, entered the vaulted passage which led towards the chambers of Don Guzman, paused at the door, and without one word struck on the panel one strong blow. A stern voice from within cried “enter!” And he did enter, and closed the door behind him, and locked and double locked it; and though strange sounds were heard, and fearful voices, about half an hour passed ere be came forth; and when he did so, his face, though very stern and calm, was pale as death; and he retired to his own quarters without a word to any one. CHAPTER VI. It was not until a late hour on the night following that of Hernando's departure from the presence of Guarica, who was now far more seriously alarmed at what she never doubted to be an attempt, on Herreiro's part, to execute his deadly menace, than she had been at his outrage towards herself, that Orozimbo returned from Caonabo's council, heated, and out of breath, as if he had run hard; and somewhat fatigued, but with an air of high enthusiasm and excitement, such as before she had never seen in her brother's features. So much, however, was she engrossed with the thoughts of what had, the previous night, befallen her— proving as it did, beyond a doubt, the implacable and fiendish malice of Don Guzman, and filling her with the wildest apprehensions for her beloved Hernando's safety—that she paid fair less attention to the manner or appearance of her brother, than under any other circumstances she would have done. Eagerly, and with a vehement rapidity of speech, singularly at variance with the calm and almost inanimate tranquillity of her usual demeanor, she related to Orozimbo, without remarking the absent and distracted expression with which he listened to her, the wondrous attempt on her life and that of De Leon. If she was not surprised, however, at the vacancy of his look, as she began her narrative, she was indeed astonished, although she well knew the excitability of his nature, at the tremendous burst of passion with which he replied to her last words. “I thank the Great Spirit,” he cried, springing to his feet, and shaking his hand furious ly aloft, “I thank the Great Spirit that it is so! This, this alone was needful to banish the last throb of compunection, to extinguish the last spark of mercy or of friendship in my soul. Ha! ha! It is well, very well! He would have slain thee? Ha! let him look to himself, now, dog and villain. Now am I all the Charib; now am I all my country's! Give me my arms, give me my arms, Guarica, I am but wasting time, when time is most precious. Give me my helm of tiger skin—give me the golden buckler, the strong war-club of my father; never yet was it brandished in more just or holy cause; give me—” “Hold! Orozimbo,” exclaimed the lovely girl, now terrified by his continued vehemence, “what mean you, brother? For what should I give you arms? Are you mad, that you dream—you, you alone, of seeking out this Spaniard in his guarded fortress. Why, boy, the very sentinels would spurn you from their gates!” “Will they? ha! will they? Will the two paltry sentinels who stand beside their empty cannon, spurn back unconquered Caonabo? Let them look, I say, let them now look to themselves, these ravishing and murderous Spaniards. By the great gods! they shall learn, and that ere to-morrow's dawn, that it is one thing to strain in the hug of an Indian warrior, panting for vengeance and arthirst for blood, and another to dally in the soft arms of an Indian maiden!” “Brother, what mean you? Brother, brother, what fearful words are these— what frantic meaning do they bear!” “Ask me not, ask me not, Guarica; these are no times for foolish thoughts or girlish councils. Give me my arms, I say; let me begone; give me my arms!” And with the words, he seized Hernando's bugle from the wall, and, springing to the window, blew a long thrilling blast, which was answered on the instant by the dull roar of a dozen conch-shells, sounding the Indian war-note everywhere through the mighty forest. “There is your answer, Guarica—the souls of a thousand warriors, the bravest of the brave, are alive, are burning in those war-notes. Give me my arms. I say before to-morrow's day-break, there shall be no more Isabella; by the gods! no more Spaniards!” But as he spoke she threw herself at his feet, clung to his knees, watered his feet with her tears; she called on him by every tenderest pledge, invoked him by every dearest name, reminded him of every fondest memory, implored him by the soul of her gallant father, by the love of their dead mother —implored him for her sake—for her sake, whom that dying mother had confided to his charge—if he would not see her die broken-hearted at his knees, to forego, to forget his fearful purpose, to desert the disastrous combination. It was long, very long, ere she succeeded in the least in bending him; he was intractable, fierce, resolute. The last worst outrage had maddened him. It was long ere he would listen in the least to the voice of nature, much less to the words of reason. But at last nature did prevail, and old affection; his heart melted, and he raised her from the ground and kissed her, and mixed his tears with hers. But even when this step was gained, she had yet much to do, ere she could win him to her wishes. Pride now forbade him to desert the expedition in which he had enlisted with such zealous ardor—to forsake the comrades to whom his faith was pledged, to prove disloyal to the monarch to whom he insisted that he owed allegiance. But Guarica's mind, although a woman's, and a young lovely woman's too, was of the firmer and the sterner stuff, and in the end it conquered. Reason and wisdom were on her side, and for once reason and wisdom carried the day, over passion and brute violence. She showed him, in clear colors, the hopelessness, the madness of the expedition; she proved to him, beyond the power of paradox to resist, that even if in the first their efforts should be crowned with success, the end would but be the more disastrous to the rash patriots, and to their country. “Even,” she said, “even if you should carry Isabella—if you should, as you tell me you have sworn to do, burn it with fire, and raze it to the very earth, till not one stone remain upon another—even if you should drown the smoking embers of the last Spanish dwelling with the life-blood of the last Spanish soldier, what will all this avail you? Is not the great, the God-like, the invincible and irresistible Columbus, even now flying hitherward on the wings of the very wind to which you propose to fling your banners of defiance? Does he not bring with him a fleet, a whole fleet, freighted with steel-clad men, invulnerable, and with no mimic thunderbolts? And will not he avenge—merciful as he is, and good, and gracious—will not he exact awful retribution for the destruction of his comrades? And who dare hope to succeed, to strive even, against the unconquered, the unconquerable admiral? Spare them, my brother, spare—I will not say your sister, but your king, your countrymen, your country!” “But how?” replied Orozimbo, mightily moved both by her arguments and her pas sion, “how shall I dare be a deserter—a traitor to my tribe—a recreant to my honor? How, if I do so, shall I ever dare again to show my face before my tribemen?—to take my seat in the council of the chiefs? No! sister, no! it is too late—too late! and if you be i' the right, as now I believe you are, to-morrow will be a day fatal both to us and to our invaders. I would—I would, indeed, that I had told you of our plans heretofore, while there was yet the time to listen to your arguments—but it is now too late, and I must on.” “It is never too late to repent, brother,” answered the eager and excited girl—“never too late to exchange evil for good counsel, madness for wisdom, crime for virtue. And it is evil counsel, it is madness—yes! Orozimbo, it is crime; knowingly to rush headlong on destruction; nor to destroy yourself alone, but to involve hundreds in one common, hopeless, unnecessary ruin. Listen to me, and believe me, brother. You may think —you do think, doubtless, that I am but a love-sick girl, pleading the cause of selfish passion, terrified for her lover's safety, and willing to give up all beside, friends, kinsmen, country, so that my senseless love for this stranger of a hostile race may be gratified. No! by my Christian faith, no! by the Christian's God, whom he has taught me to adore! it is not so. Were there a reasonable hope that permanent success could follow your bold exploit—were there one chance in the thousand that our country could be once more free—that the invader's foot-prints could be erased for ever from our virgin shores—that no white face should ever more be seen in our happy fields—then, Orozimbo, then would I cry forward! forward! although your first step should be planted on my breaking heart, and the next on my Hernando's prostrate head! Then would my voice be the first and the loudest to cheer you to the fray, as it is now the only one to warn you.” “And why not,”—asked her brother, gloomily, as he sat with his head buried between his hands—“Why is it not so now?” “You know why not,” she answered, firmly. “You know that, were every white man swept, to-night, from the face of our fair island, thousands and tens of thousands would spring up in their places. When was the Spaniard's footstep ever checked by the fear of peril?—when was his lust of gold every repressed by thoughts of the risk incurred in snatching? Their race is as numerous as the green leaves of the forest, or as the sands on the sea-shore—in fierceness they are the tiger's equals, in wisdom they are almost gods! Look at the beasts which they have trained to fight their battles: the glorious war-horse, with his eye kindling to the trumpet; the dreadful blood-hound, more wily and more savage than the jaguar; look at their bright, impenetrable armor, from which your strongest shafts rebound, as from the earthfast rock; look at their cannon-shot, more perilous to man than beaven's own thunders. And then think—think if a few, a mere handful of adventurers—for such they were who first landed on our shores— if they have subjugated half, aye! four-fifths of our nation, and that for the mere love of gold and of dominion, think what their nation would effect in its majesty and might, roused to revenge the blood of its slaughtered sons—roused to uphold and vindicate the honor of its name! No! brother, no! when the first little band stepped forth from their winged canoes upon our hospitable shores, had our people then broken down upon them with the spear and mace, the death-drum and the battle-cry—had they all perished to a man, and none returned across the wide, wide sea, to tell their comrades' fate—then might we have been saved from the white man's dominion. But the very day that saw the first caravella spread its wings to the homeward breeze, that day, I tell you, riveted on our necks a yoke that must endure for ever. I tell you their mariners, their very dumb and senseless galleys, know the path to and fro the trackless deep, as surely as you know the wood-tracks of our native island. For every Spanish breath you quench, a hundred, and a hundred times a hundred, will be quenched, and for ever, of our own; for every drop of Spanish blood you shed, rivers shall flow of ours. The white man has an eye that descries everything, though seas may roll between; an arm that strikes a thousand leagues aloof; a hand that, when it once hath closed upon its prey, never fore-goes its hold! I have spoken!—but I look not that you will believe me! Go! pour your naked hundreds against the mail clad cavaliers; go! dash your bare breasts on their walls of granite; go! and expose your mortal flesh to the blasting breath of their cannon: and then, when all is lost, when, hunted to the last verge of the precipice, bayed by their unrelenting hounds, cut down by their resistless steel,—no longer even to be saved as the remnant of a people—ye call upon the earth to yawn and swallow ye, upon the rocks to fall and cover ye—and earth and rocks are pitiless as your avenging foemen—then, I say, then remember the words of her whom you murdered—of your sister, your only and fond sister, who told you all these things, how they should be, and you heard not her warning, but laughed her words to scorn, and murdered her—the last of your unhappy race!” “Murdered you!” he exclaimed, starting to his feet—“murdered you, Guarica!” and his dark features were convulsed, and his limbs trembled with the violence of his contending passions. “Ay, Orozimbo! murdered; for think you that I could, even if I would, survive him— and that, too, knowing him slaughtered by a brother!” “But I have charged my warriors,” he exclaimed, vehemently—“but I have drawn an oath from Caonabo, to spare him in the strife, and, the war ended, to treat him as a friend and kinsman.” “And how long would your charge be heeded?—until the first frenzy of the strife had turned their blood to liquid fire. And how long would Caonabo's oath be kept, after its end was answered? Tush! brother, tush! If you can so deceive yourself, so can you not deceive me; moreover, think you Hernando de Leon is the man to be spared— to spare himself in such a conflict? Think you Hernando de Leon is the man to survive the extermination of his comrades, and to clasp in his own the reeking hands of their butchers! If he were so, he might seek some European girl to share his life, and his infamy—an Indian maid would scorn him. No! Orozimbo, follow out your plans, and mark what I tell you: when the last blow is stricken, when the last heroes die around the flag-staff of their country's honor, there will be found my slaughtered love, and there will I die on his body. Go! boy; we meet on earth no more. Go, brother, to your duty; I have mine, likewise?” She ended; but long before she ended, her soul-fraught eloquence, the fire and pathos that were blended in her words, and above all, the truth of what she said, had won back the ascendency which she had ever had over her brother's spirit—the ascendency of moral strength over physical power—of mind over matter. It was now his turn to cast himself at his sister's feet, but, ere he could do so, she had caught him in her arms, and clasped him to her heart, and covered him with the chaste kisses of a sister's holy love. “Guarica!” he said, “dear, dear Guarica, you have prevailed. Do with me as you will; I am your slave—the creature of your bidding. Only think for me, and say how I shall save my honor!” “Go to your uncle!” she cried impetuously. “Go straight to the wise and noble Caonabo, and say to him as I have said to thee”— “It would avail me nothing; he would either strike me to the earth, or drive me in scorn from his presence: he will endure no opposition to his will, and hear no reason. As well may you hope to turn the sun from his course, as Caonabo from his project.” “Then mark me, brother. This plot of the great cacique depends, you tell me, on his finding the fortress unprepared, and the guards negligent and off their duty?” “Aye!” he replied, “but what of that?” “Ask me no further. Only observe what I say: all shall go well yet. At what time is your onslaught appointed to begin?” “Soon after day-break”— “Then go: join your leaders—take your arms; lead your followers hence; but be sure that you lead all of them: leave not a soul behind you to play the spy on me. Where do your warriors muster?” “By the spring, which they call the `hunter's rest,' in the woodlands, within a mile of Isabella.” “I know—I know,” replied Guarica; “then go, brother, go: be of good cheer; all shall go well yet. Ask me no questions; but he sure that you send scouts to mark if the Spaniards be so unprepared as you imagine, ere you proceed to the attack.” “So it is ordered, sister. But you mean not”— “Ask me no questions,” she replied, smiling; “for I shall answer none. Whate'er I do, that will I do honestly and wisely, and it were better for all causes that you should know naught else. Kiss me, dear brother, and farewell; it is long, long past midnight. Farewell, go to your duty, and remember”— “Never will I forget, Guarica—never will I forget what you have said to me this night. By all the gods! I swear to do, henceforth, whatever you command me.” And with the words, he seized the arms which she gave him hastily, clasped her once more in his arms, and, calling to his Indian followers, who were collected under arms already, at a short distance from the building, to follow him at their speed, he set of at a long, swinging run, over the open meadow, and through the deep woodland, towards the forest rendezvous. Scarcely was her brother out of sight, before the girl, who had eagerly watched his departure, and satisfied herself that none of his myrmidons remained behind, applied herself hastily to collect some articles of clothing more suitable, as it appeared, than those she wore, for a long and toilsome walk through the forest. She bound a pair of stronger sandals on her feet; she girded up her dress succinctly, in a form not unlike that of the graceful Doric chiton, as represented in the statues of Diana. She took in her hand a long, light, reed javelin, with a flint head: it may have been as a staff to support her footsteps; it might have been as a weapon of defence; and with no further preparation, alone and unprotected, save by her own high resolution—by that innate and noble daring which springs from the consciousness of chastity, and innocence, and truth—that glorious confidence of incorrupt virginity, concerning which “It is said that a lion will turn and flee From a maid, in the pride of her purity.” Fearless and firm in her high self-reliance, in her yet higher trust in God, forth she went into the wild and midnight forest, upon her errand of goodwill and mercy. The sky was dim and clouded; not a star twinkled through the murky gloom: not a moonbeam checkered the dark shadows of the heavy trees: yet on she went, unshrinking and undaunted, although the howl of the wolf and the prowling foot of the panther came constantly to her ear; though the snake coiled itself in her path, and the tangled briers opposed her passage, still, all night long, she travelled steadily onward, in the intent to warn the garrison of Isabella of the approaching peril, that they might be on their guard in time, and that the attack might be spared. Full of her noble purpose, inspired by high benevolence and immortal love with strength beyond her powers, she struggled insensible to fatigue, and superior to weak terrors—but all would have been in vain, for the day was beginning to show the first pale tokens of its coming in the far east, while she was yet many miles aloof from the Spanish fortress, and cold apprehension near akin to despair, was usurping rapidly the place of high hope and confidence, when suddenly, as she turned an angle of the blind deer-path she was treading, her eye was attracted and astonished by a clear light, burning purely in the deepest part of the forest. Holding her very breath for fear its slightest aspiration might betray her, and treading stealthily upon the fallen leaves, she stole towards it, and, ere she had gone many steps, a strange sight met her eyes. In a small sheltered glade of the forest, stretched on the ground, with their watch cloaks round them, in deep slumber, their long lances planted erect by every sleeper's head, and their bright burnished helmets at their sides, lay ten Spanish cavaliers; their tall chargers with their steel-plated demipiques, champons upon their frontlets, and iron poitrels on their breasts, stood round them, linked by their chain bridles, each horse hard by his lord. But at a little distance from the rest one man kept watch—but kept watch rather as 6 a cowled monk than as a dauntless warrior —for he knelt on both his knees, with his hands clasped in earnest supplication before an exquisitely painted picture of the virgin, which he had hung, by a little chain attached to it, from the hilt of his dagger driven deep into the stem of a gigantic palm tree. It was before this picture that burned, in a small lamp of richly embossed silver, fed with some odoriferous oil, the strange clear light which she had seen through the dim aisles of the forest. It was a wild and singular scene, and worthy of the pencil of Salvator. The sweet white silvery light streaming upwards, and playing over the heavenly features of the Madonna, which seemed to smile in the focus of its consecrated radiance, thence flashing on the dark enthusiastic features of the kneeling warrior, dancing upon his waving plume and polished armor, and thence flickering less distinctly over the figures of his sleeping comrades, and over the large limbs of the barbed chargers, which looked even larger and more formidable when half seen in the dim and hazy lustre of the distance. The warrior who was kneeling at his orisons in that wild place, and at that untimely hour, was a man not above the middle height, perhaps rather under it, but very powerfully built, with broad shoulders and thin flanks, and a chest singularly prominent and deep; his arms were long and muscular, and his legs, although slightly bowed outward, perhaps from constant exercise on horseback, were unusually strong and sinewy. From head to heel he was sheathed in a full panoply of Spanish steel, richly wrought with gold arabesques and bosses; his casque with its tall crimson plume, which indeed he rarely laid aside, was on his head, although the avantaille was raised, displaying his bold manly features. Gilt spurs of knighthood was buckled on his heels over his greaves and shoes of burnished steel, and from a scarf of rich crimson silk hung his long two-edged broadsword. Such was Alonzo de Ojeda, the wildest and most daring spirit, the most fiery warrior, the most perfect knight of the bold band which had left the gay courts of their native land for the fierce forays and the wild adventures of the new western world. Fervently as he was praying to the especial object of his chivalric and imaginative worship, his ear, accustomed to every sound, however slight or distant, of the forest, caught instantly the light tread of the Indian maiden, and recognised it as instantly for a human footstep. He started to his feet, and cried aloud— “Ho! who goes there?” And ere the last words had left his lips, all his brave partisans were afoot, and on the alert around him. “If you be friendly,” he continued, “draw near fearlessly; if foes, be on your guard!” and then turning towards his nearest comrade, “It was a woman's tread I heard, if I mistake not—” He had said but thus far, when Guarica stepped forth modestly but firmly into the circle of light which the lamp cast for a little space around the armed group, saying— “It is, Sir Knight, indeed a woman—but as she is so fortunate as to recognise Alonzo de Ojeda, she knows full well that she is as safe in his presence in the wild forest, alone, and unprotected, as she would be surrounded by a hundred of her tribes-men!” “Lady,” replied Alonzo, “for lady you must needs be, to understand so truly the spirit and devotion of a true cavalier, you do me, I am proud to say, no more than justice. But what are your commands at this dead hour? or wherefore have you sought me thus strangely, and how have you found me? “I sought you not, Don Alonzo,” answered the Charib maiden; “I sought you not, but right fortunate is it that without seeking I have found you, for life and death is on my haste, and the distance, which I cannot accomplish even in hours, your coursers will make good in minutes.” “Your words are full of emphasis,” answered Ojeda, gravely, “and you speak as one used to authority, and accustomed to command. May I know with whom I am conversing?” “My name will avail you little, senor. It is, I think, unknown to you—I am called Guarica; but if my name be strange, my lineage is well known to you—I am the niece and adopted daughter of queen Anacaona.” “Of the good queen—the friend of the Admiral? Say then, dear lady, what is your errand? If done it may be at all, trust me it shall be done right speedily.” “It must be so done—if it be done at all. But it must be said in your private ear. It is too secret, too full of dread import, to be spoken even before your chosen comrades.” And with the words she motioned him to move a little way apart, and he followed her with an air of deep respect, which, however different from the mode of treatment most of his countrymen would have vouchsafed to an Indian girl, was perfectly in keeping with the grand though perhaps exaggerated character of his knight errantry. Although, therefore, he moved out of earshot of his brother partisans, he did not suffer her to go so far from them that any motion on the part of either should be unseen by all; for with a delicate compunction, most honorable to his feelings, he was resolved that her reputation should in no wise suffer by her noble confidence in his integrity. The other Spaniards, who awaited in great wonder and some surprise the issue of this strange conference, soon saw by the extreme surprise which every gesture of Alonzo indicated, that the girl's news must be indeed important. They could perceive that he asked two or three questions, which were answered readily, and it seemed satisfactorily, for after a minute or two, Alonzo raised her hand to his lips, and kissed it respectfully—saying, “Thanks—thanks! eternal thanks!— This never shall be forgotten—never! and be not alarmed, there is ample time!” Then turning to his men, he cried in quick, commanding tones— “To horse! to horse, hastily!” But even in the hurry and confusion which succeeded, confusion tending unto order, they could see that Guarica again spoke to him even more urgently than before, and they heard him answer, “I promise you—I promise you, upon the honor of a cavalier—upon my honor, it shall be as you wish. Unless they return again, there shall be no bloodshed.” And again kissing her hand, he hastily put up his picture of the virgin and his hallowed lamp in his knapsack, where at all times and in all expeditions he ever carried them, mounted his war-horse, thundered his orders in a voice meant by nature for command, and spurring his horse to the gallop, rode furiously, straight as the bird flies through the forest, to the gates of Isabella. Don Guzman de Herreiro had just ridden out of sight, as Alonzo reached the drawbridge, which he found actually lowered, with but some three or four half drunken soldiers lounging about the gate-house. But ere he had been within the walls ten minutes, the drums beat to arms, the great alarm bell tolled, the gates were barricaded, and the bridges raised; cannon were loaded, and extra ammunition served to the cannoneers. The Spanish flag was hoisted, and the whole garrison was mustered in full war array upon the guarded ramparts. These preparations had been made about an hour, when two or three Indians were seen lurking about the edge of the nearest woodland, and their appearance being hailed by a flourish of trumpets, and a show of soldiers manœuvering upon the esplanade above the gates, they instantly retired, and nothing was heard or seen that day from the walls of Isabella to justify the suddenness of Alonzo de Ojeda's arrival, and the alarm he had occasioned. CHAPTER VII. The whole of the day on which Hernando de Leon returned from his nocturnal chase, passed gloomily; no eye of sentinel or warder beheld Don Guzman de Herreiro, nor was he at the hall wherein his comrades feasted. Hernando, on the contrary, far from his wonted temper, was there the gayest of the gay; his repartee the keenest yet most polished; his laugh the merriest; his song the most entrancing. Men who had known him for long years—who had fought by his side in the wild forays with the Saracens of bright Grenada, and in the scarce less desperate encounters of the tameless Charib—men who had borne all perils of the sea, the wilderness, and worse than all, the lazar-house, with him; men who had feasted at the jovial board, and drained the wassail cup for years with him, now marvelled; they felt as though there were something in his manner which they had never known before; a melancholy in the merriment, yet mingled with a recklessness which baffled their sagacity; a deep romantic sentiment, an all-pervading tone of profound thought in his lightest converse, blent with an air of strange abstraction—a breaking off from graver subjects, and plunging into bursts of wild and furious mirth; and then again a softening of the mirth into the sweetest and the saddest touches of imagination that poet ever dreamed, or minstrel sang. Thus passed the evening meal; and when the comrades parted, the souls of many who had felt estranged, they scarce knew why, from the young cavalier, yearned to partake again his high and generous friendship, grasped his hand more warmly than they had done for months, although their present mood of kindliness was in no less degree unmeaning, than had been their suspicion and distrust Gaily they parted, with many merry comments on the unwonted absence of Don Guzman, and many a jocular conjecture as to the cause of his feigned illness; for when the trumpets had rung forth their gladsome peals of invitation to the festive board, the seneschal had borne to the presiding officer his courteous greetings, and regrets that he was ill at ease, and might not, for that day, participate in their accustomed revelries. They parted—and night fell dim and silent over the Spanish fortress. Throughout that long and weary night the lamp was still replenished in the lone chamber of Don Gazman; and still from hour to hour the solitary inmate paced to and fro the floor, his long spurs clanking with a dull and heavy sound on the rude pavement; and now pausing to mutter, with clenched hands and writhing lip, fierce imprecations on his own head—on the head of his detested comrade, and on the weak hand which had failed to execute his deadly purpose; now hurrying onward with unequal but swift strides, as though he would have fled the torture of his own guilty thoughts. Thus did he pass that night, in agony more bitter than the direst tortures that ever tyrant wreaked on mortal body; and when the first grey light of dawning morn fell cold and chill through the uncurtained casements of his barrack-room, it found him haggard and feverish, yet pale withal, shivering as though he were an ague-stricken sufferer. The morning gun pealed sharp and sudden from the ramparts, and far and long its echoes were repeated from the dark forests which girt in, on every side, with their interminable walls of deathless verdure, the battlements of Isabella. At the sound Guzman started, as does the miserable guilty wretch who hears the sullen bell toll the dread signal for his execution! Manning himself, however, with a start, while the blood rushed, as though indignant at his former weakness, to lip and cheek and brow, he instantly resumed his agitated walk, nor did he break it off, nor give the smallest symptom of perception, when a quick, hurried blow was struck upon the panel of the door; a second and a third time was that low tap repeated, but still Don Guzman heard it not, or if he did hear, heeded not; then the door slowly opened, and a grey-headed veteran, clothed in the liveries of that noble house to which, perchance, his master was the first scion who had brought no lustre, thrust in his time-blanched locks and war-worn visage. “Your charger waits, senor,” he whispered; “the hour has long gone by.” “Hurry, then, hurry,” shouted Herreiro, fiercely, and belting on his long Toledo, and casting his broad-leafed sombrero on his disordered locks, he rushed out with wild haste, no less to the dismay than the astonishment of his stanch servitor, whom he had summoned, almost savagely, to follow him. Far otherwise had passed the hours of darkness to Hernando de Leon. The banquet ended, he had withdrawn to his chamber, as though he had no further object than to lie down upon a peaceful bed, that he might thence arise with the succeeding morn to go about his wonted avocations. He had sat down before his little escrutoire, and, having finished several letters, sealed and directed them—cast off his vest and doublet, and drawn from his feet his falling leathern buskins—then throwing himself upon his knees beside his pallet-bed, buried his head between his hands, and for some time prayed, as it would seem, in deep though silent fervor. Rising at length erect, he spread his arms abroad, and in a clear high voice, unconscious, evidently, that he spoke aloud, “and above all, bear witness Thou,” he cried, “bear witness Thou who knowest and seest all things, that not in any mortal wrath —not in the mood of blind and senseless anger, nor in that selfish strain of vengeance which thinks of private injury, do I go forth unto this strife, but as unto a high and solemn duty! Not as mine own avenger— for to Thee, and to Thee only, doth belong the right of vengeance—but as the vindicator of society, the punisher of crime, which else must go unpunished—the righter of the wronged—the champion of the weak —the faithful, although frail defender of thine holy law. If this be not so, forsake me thou, oh Lord! Give me up to the mercies of my direst foe—suffer me to fall unavenged, unwept, and unhonored! But if in truth and honor, and in right I do go forth, strike Thou, as is thy wont, for the right, likewise.” This said, he lay down quietly upon his couch, and, ere five minutes had passed over him, slept peaceably and sweetly as an infant, until the self-same gun which had aroused Don Guzman from the perturbed visions of his guilty conscience, broke his refreshing slumbers. Arising instantly, he, too, girt on his sword, buckled his mantle over his broad chest, fixed his hat firmly on his head, and strode forth, all unsummoned, to the water-gate. There stood four noble chargers; his own proud Andalusian, with a less high-bred charger at his side, backed by the page Alonzo, who, with a merlin on his wrist, and the two powerful blood-hounds, without which never did Hernando ride forth into the wilderness, crouching before him, sat patiently awaiting the arrival of his lord. A little way aloof a menial, clad in the rich liveries of Isabel and silver, held the bay coursers of Herreiro and his old squire. No foot did Don Hernando set in stirrup, but seizing the reins firmly in his left hand, while with his right he grasped the cantle of his demi-pique, he swung himself at once with a light leap to his charger's back. Flinging the reins free to the impulse of the fiery horse, while he stood yet erect, he curbed him tightly up as his feet struck the sod, and slightly pricking him with his long gilded spurs, dashed off at a hand gallop into the wild glades of the forest. A short mile's distance from the walls of Isabella, embosomed in deep woodlands, there was a small savanna, scarcely a hundred yards across, clothed with short mossy grass, which, in that lovely climate, never, at any season, lost the rich freshness of its emerald verdure; for, in its furthest curve, lurking beneath the shelter of a group of tall and feathery palm-trees, where lay the basin of a tiny crystal spring, whence welling forth, in copious and perennial beauty, a silver streamlet issued—and, compassing two-thirds of that small plain with its refreshing waters, stole away silently among the devious wilds through which it flowed, unmarked, into the neighboring sea. Here it was—here, in this lovely and secluded spot, far—far as it would seem removed from the fierce turmoils, the stern bitterness, the angry hatreds of the world, that the two foe-men were to meet. For half an hour, at least, Hernando had sat there, motionless as a statue, upon his docile charger, awaiting, in the centre of that sylvan solitude, the coming of his antagonist. Just as he had begun to marvel at the protracted absence of his intended slayer, the sharp and rattling clatter of a horse's gallop, tearing his route through the dense saplings of the tangled wood, was heard approaching; and in another moment, his reins, and neck, and chest embossed with flakes of snow-white form, and his flanks bleeding from incessant spurring, Herreiro's charger bore him, at the top of his speed, into the scene of action. As he approached, Hernando raised his hat, with the stern courtesy exacted by the strict punctilio of the duel from every honorable cavalier; yet well schooled as he was to suppress each outward token of every inward sentiment, the noble cavalier half started as he beheld the ravages worked by a single night of anguish on the proud mien and comely features of his antagonist. His hair, which on the previous morning had been as dark and glossy as the black raven's wing, was now not merely tangled most disorderly in hideous elf-locks, but actually streaked with many a lock of grey; while his whole visage, which, though swart and somewhat stern, had yet been smooth and seemly, was scored by many a line and furrow, ploughed deep into the flesh during those few fleet hours, by the hot plough-shares of remorse and scorching anguish. No salutation did he make in answer to the bow of his brave young opponent; but whirling his long rapier from its sheath—“Draw!” he cried, “draw, sir! Look on the sun for the last time and die!” and, as he spoke, plunging his spurs even more furiously than he had done before into the bleeding flanks of his good horse, he dashed at once upon him sword in hand, hoping, it was most evident, to take him at advantage, and bear him, unprepared, to earth. If such, however, were his ungenerous and foul intent, most grievously was he frustrated by the calm skill and perfect resolution of Hernando; who merely gathering his reins a little tighter, unsheathed his keen Toledo; and—without moving one yard from the spot whereon his Andalusian stood, watching with fiery eye and broad expanded nostrils, the motions of the other charger, yet showing by no symptom, save the quivering of his erected ears, that he was conscious of the coming strife, extended it with the point towards Herreiro's face. On came the fierce assailant; on! with the speed of light; his left hand clasping the reins firmly; his right drawn back, in preparation for the deadly thrust, far past his hip; while the bright point of the long two edged blade was ghttering in advance of the bay charger's frontlet! Now they are within half-sword's length—and now!—see! see that quick, straight flash, bright as the stream of the electric fluid, and scarce, if anything, less rapid! it was the thrust of Guzman, well aimed, and sped with strength, that, had it reached the mark, must have propelled it through the stoutest corslet that ever bucklered breast; much more through the slight silken jerkin which was the only armor that would have opposed its brunt. Midway, however, in its glancing course it was met by the calm, firm parry of Hernando's sword; and thus, diverted from its true direction, passed harmless, slightly grazing the bridle arm of the young cavalier. On came Herreiro still; and for an instant's space it seemed as though the shock of his charger at full speed must have born down the slighter Andalusian; but scarcely had he parried that home thrust before, with a quick motion of the bridle hand; so quick, indeed, that it was scarce perceptible; and a slight corresponding pressure of the spur on the flank opposite, Hernando wheeled his charger to the left; feinted a thrust at his foe's face; and, circling quite around him, delivered a full sweeping cut against the back part of his neck. With perfect mastery of steed and weapon, Don Guzman met this perilous and unexpected movement. Pulling so hard on his long Moorish curb, that his horse, checked at once, stood upright and almost fell backward on his haunches, he swung his sword round to the guard so actively, that the strong blow fell harmless. Then they closed hand to hand; fragments of the short mossy turf flew high into the air, spurned by the iron heels of the excited chargers; sparks flew from the collision of the well-tempered blades; feathers were shorn, blood flowed on either side! Yet neither failed nor faltered. At length a furious down-right cut, aimed by Don Guzman full at Hernando's head, glanced from his guard, and falling on the ear of the high-blooded Andalusian, almost dissevered it! Maddened with torture, the brave brute obeyed the bit no longer, but, with a yell of agony, bolted, despite the utmost efforts of the rider. Herreiro marked his advantage, and as the horse uncontrollably dashed by him, cut, by a second rapid lunge, his adversary's rein asunder. Frantic although his horse was with pain, and freed from the direct restraint of the half useless bridle, Hernando was not carried far before he recovered mastery enough to wheel him round once more to the encounter. Perceiving, instantly, that all chance of success by rapid turns or quick manœuvring was at an end, he now, adopting his opponent's system, dashed straight upon him, and when within arm's length, throwing his own reins loose, caught, with his left hand, the long silver cheek-piece of Herreiro's bit, wheeling his own horse counter to flank upon him, by the mere dint of spur without the slightest exercise of bit or bridle; and shortened, at the same time, his sword to plunge it from above into the throat of the assassin. It seems as though no earthly power could have availed to rescue Guzman from his desperate situation. His horse, exhausted by his own exertions, reeled visibly beneath the shock; his rapier, far extended and abroad, could by no means have parried the down. thrust, which hung above him:—But in that very point of time, that very second, long as a thousand ages, in which he saw the dark glance of his injured comrade's eye fixed banefully upon him; in which he noted the grim smile mantling upon his scornful lip; in which he shuddered at the gleaming point of the suspended rapier, which no effort of his own could possibly avert; in that dread point of time, a yelling shout arose from all the circumjacent woodlands; a howl, as though the fiends had all broken loose, to rend the upper air with their discordant voices, and, with the yell, a volley of flint-headed arrows came hurtling through the air; another, and another! but, with the first, Hernando's half-won triumph ended! For, as he brandished his avenging sword aloft, clear through his elevated wrist drove the long Charib shaft; a second grazed his plume; a third, most fatal of the flight, pierced through the very heart of his proud Andalusian, and hurled him lifeless to the earth. Herreiro turned, turned for base flight; but not long did his forfeit life remain to him, for, with the second volley, down went both horse and man, transfixed by fifty shafts, gory and lifeless! And the last words that smote upon his deafening ear, among the yells and whoops of the wild Charibs, were those shouted in his own sonorous tongue—“This arrow for Guarica!” “And, in good truth, it was that arrow, winged from the bow of Orozimbo, that did, as he had sworn so deeply, drown the flames of his lust in his heart's blackest blood. “Mount! mount, Alonzo, mount, boy, and fly,” shouted the dauntless cavalier, as he lay wounded, and encumbered by his slaughtered horse. The bold boy heard, but obeyed him not! Forth he rushed, sword in hand, forth to the rescue of his lord; and forth, at the same instant, from the forest, forth sped the Charib Caonabo and his unconquered horde, with spear, and mace, and bow, and barbarous war-cry! “Down with your sword, 'tis madness to resist,” cried the young Spaniard: and the next second had not passed, before the servant and the master were both the fettered captives of the invincible cacique. CHAPTER VIII. After the death of Herreiro, and the capture of De Leon, the Charibs, who had so suddenly unmasked their ambuscade, in which, with the wonted patience of an Indian, they had lain during the occurrence of events which to them must have seemed strange and inexplicable, appeared, for some short time, to be in confusion, hurrying to and fro, like bees alarmed and swarming in their hives, without any very distinct plan or method. After a little while, however, they were brought into comparative order by the exertion of their chieftain, and were arrayed in five parallel columns, in the well-known Indian file; each headed by a plumed cacique, and containing, as nearly as Hernando could conjecture, each, something better than a hundred warriors. In the meantime, Hernando, with the page, was compelled to sit down at the foot of the tree to which Alonzo's horse and the bloodhounds were attached, and both were bound firmly with their arms pinioned behind them to the mossy trunk. An interval of nearly half an hour followed, the chiefs being continually on the look out, as if they expected messengers; and as these did not come, even more uncertainty was displayed than before in the movements of the savages, who broke their ranks, and crowded round a little knoll at some distance, on which Hernando could perceive a tall, powerful Indian, with a plumed crown, and many ornaments of gold on his breast, and about his neck and arms, whom he took to be Caonabo, the great Charib chief; the most resolute opponent and formidable foe the Spaniards had encountered on the island. Around this chief there was soon collected a group of chiefs gesticulating violently, and speaking very loud; so much so that Hernando was well nigh convinced that, once or twice, he heard his own name mentioned: an idea in which he was confirmed by seeing that many of the Indians looked towards him, and two or three pointed with their hands, as the sounds which he judged to be intended for his name were repeated. Looking more earnestly, as he now did, he thought that one of the figures of the younger chiefs resembled Orozimbo; and he was certain that this person was arguing violently with the great chief, and, as he believed, concerning himself likewise. While he was gazing with all his eyes, a deep and sudden sound came down the wind, from the direction of the Spanish town. It was the heavy din of the alarm bell, followed, almost immediately, by the faint rattle of the drums, scarce audible at that distance, calling the garrison to arms. This in an instant, put an end, as if by magic, to the confused debate. The men hurried back into their files, the chiefs took their places at the head of each; and if it was indeed Orozimbo whom he had seen, he could no more distinguish him among the crowd: nor did he again see the person whom he had fancied to be he, during the whole course of the day. Scarcely were the Charibs again steady in their ranks, before three or four Indian scouts came rushing up, breathless and black with sweat, from the forest, with tidings, it would seem, of great importance. For they flew straight to the gigantic chieftain, and he, after hearing their report, called out four or five old caçiques, and held a short, grave consultation. After this, Hernando and his page were unbound from the tree, and, with their arms still fettered, placed, each apart from the other, in the centre of a file, between two stout Indians. A word was given; it was passed from man to man, and then they began their march, silent and slow, in one long, single file, towards the dark and distant wilderness. All day long did the wily savages retreat, through the most wild and devious recesses of the forest, toward their mountain fastnesses, forcing their hapless captives, wounded though they were, and faint and weary, to strain every muscle to keep up with them. At mid-day, for a short hour, they halted at a bright, crystal spring, deep-bosomed in the pathless wilderness, kindled their fires, and applied themselves to the preparation of their artless meal. Most picturesque and striking was the aspect of that wild halt; and had it been at any other time, no eye would have dwelt on it with more earnest pleasure; no fancy would have sported more poetically with all its thousand accidents of light and shade, repose contrasted with swift motion, rare grouping, and bright coloring, than that of the young Spaniard. But as he lay beneath the canopy of a superb mimosa, with his arms painfully lashed behind his back with thongs, recently cut from a raw deer-hide, his thoughts were all too painfully absorbed, too vague, wandering, and distracted, to suffer him to dwell upon, or notice, that gay spectacle. Conjecture was at work within his brain; but, busy as it was, no clue presented itself to his mind, whereby to solve the mystery. All was dark, intricate, and gloomy! By no means could he discover or divine what could have been the cause of such an inroad; or by what strange accident he should himself have fixed the rendezvous for the precise spot where the Charibs had laid their ambuscade, for that they could have learned the premeditated duel was, on the very face of things, impossible. Why such a force of Indians should have been mustered (for the band was, at the very least reckoning, five hundred strong), under their most redoubted champion, merely to interrupt a combat between two Spanish warriors; or why, supposing, as it was far more natural to deem, that the true object of the expedition had contemplated some end widely different, after the accidental capture of one soldier, had the real purpose of the onslaught been laid by, and overlooked, in the delight arising from a success so slight and unimportant! Deeply, however, as he pondered, he found not, heretofore, the smallest clue whereby to reach the termination of the maze in which his thoughts were so mysteriously involved. At times, a wild and anxious terror would possess his mind with the idea that his capture must be connected in some wise with his repeated visits to the Charib maiden, whom he had so devotedly enthroned within his heart of hearts,—meet idol for that magic shrine!—that the most distant surmise of peril to which she should be exposed, shook his strong nerves, even as an earthquake agitates the rock-ribbed mountains. Anon, as reason told him that such fancies were the mere visionary workings of a self-tormenting spirit, his features would array themselves in a wan, sickly smile, and he would deem, for a brief moment, that cheerfulness and hope were re-established in his heart. Thus passed the mid-day halt; the simple preparations for the Indian meal were ended, and seated on the velvet cushioned greensward, the natives ate in silence and in haste, betokening the need of rare and, to their inert and voluptuous characters, unwelcome toil and exertion. Food and a calabash of water were set before Hernando; and a significant, although mute, gesture urged him to profit by the opportunity thus offered—but, though he was aware of the necessity of keeping up, as far as possible, his physical, as well as mental powers, in order to exert himself on any chance occasion to effect his own escape, and that of his loved page, from the fierce savages, the fever of his wounds, enhanced by the anxiety and burning bitterness of his soul, had parched his throat and lips, and he turned with irrepressible and painful loathing from the viands, which, though rude and simple, might well have satisfied the palate of a soldier fasting since the preceding night, and spent with toil and travel. Deeply, however, did he drink of the cool liquid crystal, with which his calabash was often and again replemished by a bright eyed youth of gentler mien, and milder features than any other of the Charibs, who, from the first, had hovered unremarked about the captives, and who now smiled cheerily upon Hernando, while ministering with something of solicitude and tenderness to his most pressing wants. After the Spaniard had exhausted at a single draught the second gourd of water, and had relapsed into the deep abstraction of his own fevered thoughts, he was half startled by the soothing pressure of a cool soft hand upon his burning brow, laving his temples with the same pure icy element which had so gratefully relieved his burning thirst—turning his eyes up with a sudden impulse, he caught again the features of the slight Indian boy, which several times before had met his gaze that morning, although unnoticed in the engrossing tumult of his senses. Again a brilliant smile glanced over the dark lineaments, and a quick flashing light, as if of well-pleased recognition, leaped from the lustrous eyes. Although his face was strange, although to the best of the young Spaniard's memory, never before had those dusky features met his eyes, there was yet something in their aspect which was familiar, something which brought back— Hernando knew not why—bright thoughts of by-gone days, and kindled livelier hopes of future welfare—something of indistinct and vague similitude to some one he had seen before, although he could not, on the instant, bring to his mind, or time, or place, or person. Thought was at work within him, to make out wherein, and to whom, lay this strange similitude, while still the gentle hand steeped his hot forehead, and the mild eyes gazed into his with almost female tender ness. Sudden it flashed upon him—sudden as the electric gleam! A radiant light shot from his clouded eyes, his lips moved, and the first syllables of an Indian word were quivering on his tongue, when the boy, instantly appreciating the meaning of that sudden lustre, assuming a grave and warning air—pressed his forefinger on his lip, and waved his left hand with a gesture so slight, as to be imperceptible except to him for whom it was intended, towards the great chieftain Caonabo, who lay at a short distance under the overbowering shadow of a huge forest tree, mantled with thousands of sweet parasites, engaged in consulation—as it would seem from their grave brows and quiet gestures—of deep import with his superior warriors. This done, he turned away and was lost instantly to the sight of Hernando among the Charib soldiery, who were now mustering fast, their simple meal concluded, as for their onward route. Another moment, and the gigantic cacique up-started to his feet, snatched from the branch, whence they hung, his long tough bow and gaily decorated quiver, slung them across his naked shoulders, braced on his left arm a light buckler covered with thin plates of the purest gold, and grasping in his right a ponderous mace of iron-wood, curiously carved, and toothed at every angle with rows of jagged shells, stalked with an air of native dignity—which could not have been outdone, had it been equalled, by the noblest potentate of Europe's haughtiest court; across the green savannah, and stood among his warrior subjects, the mightiest and noblest of them all; the mightiest and noblest, not in the vainer attributes of rank and birth alone, not in the temporal power only, which may be and oft is bestowed upon the weak of limb and low of spirit, but in the thews and sinews, the energies, the daring, and the soul, the power to do and suffer, the sublime and unmoved constancy of purpose, the indomitable, irresistible resolve, the all which makes one man superior to his fellows. A moment he stood there, gazing around him with a fearless and proud glance upon the muster of his tribe's best soldiery; then speaking a few words to a tall savage, who throughout the day had been the nighest to his person, he stalked off slowly, followed by four at least of the five hundred which composed his band, in a direction nearly at right angles to the blind path which they had hitherto pursued, and which might be perceived beyond the little area diving right onward between walls of impenetrable verdure, into the far depths of the forest. Scarce had the last of this train vanished from sight, before the same tall savage to whose ear the parting words of Caonabo had been uttered, marshalled the little band which had been left, as it would seem, under his sole command. Fifty of these, bearing their long bows ready bent, with a flint-headed arrow notched on the string of each, filed off under the guidance of an old hoary-headed Charib, whose wrinkled brow and lean attenuated frame would have denoted him as one unfit for deeds of toil or daring, had not they been even more distinctly contradicted by the light vigor of his every motion, by the keen fire of his glaring eye-ball, and by the sinewy grace with which he wielded his war weapons. At the same cat-like pace, which Hernando had marked in the warriors of the larger band, these dark-skinned archers threaded the defile of the umbrageous path, which was so narrow as scarcely to admit one man, and was so densely walled by brakes of cane and prickly shrubs, that it would have been a harder task to penetrate their leafy ram part, than to carve out a path through the most powerful bastions that mortal workmen ever framed of eternal granite. A signal from the chief directed him to follow, and conscious of the entire hopelessness of any present opposition to his will, recruited somewhat by his brief repose, and cheered yet more by the imagination that in the number of his captors he had found at the least one friend, Hernando entered with a quick and springy step the dim pass, while, hard upon his heels, urging him up close to the warrior who preceded him, strode the tall figure of the Charib captain, followed in turn by the remainder of his train, with, in their midst, the frail and fettered form of the young Alonzo. Onward they marched, still onward, tracking the windings of that narrow road, through the deep matted swamp, over the rocky ledge, among the giants of the forest! still walled at every point by masses of luxuriant verdure, so dense as to make twilight of the scorching noonday, still so defined that a blind man might have groped out his way unerring, and still so straight that it was utterly impossible for two to go abreast. The only changes in the dark monotony of this dim defile were when it forded some wild torrent brawling along in gloomy discontent among the tangled thickets, or when it crossed, upheld on narrow causeways of rude logs, some woodgirt pool, half lake and half morass, where, for a little space, the weary eye might strive to penetrate the arch vista through which foamed the restless streamlet, or dwell upon the dull and lead-like surface of the small standing pool. Onward they marched, still onward! The sun, which all unmarked had climbed the height of heaven, and all unseen descended to its western verge, stooped like a giant bride-groom to his bed, and a more dull and brown er horror overspread the trackless forest. The stars came out in the translucent skies, spangling the firmament with their unnumbered smiles, but not one mirthful glance might penetrate the solid vault of greenery which over-canopied their route—the broad, bright moon soared up far over the tangled tree-tops, and here and there a pencil of soft lustre streamed downward through some verdant crevice, and a mild, hazy light diffused itself even in that murky avenue. Onward they marched, still onward, at one unwearied, even, silent pace. No halt was made at even-tide, no halt at the deep midnight, and the young Spaniard, proud though he was of his capacity to bear, well trained in every manly and martial exercise, felt that he was but a child in strength, and in activity, among the dark sons of the forest. The boy, Alonzo, had long since given out, and had been borne an unresisting and almost insensible weight in the stout arms of two powerful savages. Onward they went, still onward, and it was only by the utmost and most resolute exertion that Hernando could maintain the steady, swift pace which his captors held, without one pant disturbing the calm tenor of their breathing, or one sweat-drop appearing on their muscular, swart frames. Daybreak was near at hand—a deeper gloom had followed on the setting moon— the stars had waned, and a chill freshness in the air betokened the approach of morning, although the skies were yet untinged by any gleam of light, when a low whistle was heard from the head of the long file; man by man it passed rearward, and all halted. After a second's space there was a forward movement; and, after a few steps, Hernando might perceive that the path opened somewhat, and that the men who went before him, fell orderly and steadily as they advanced, into a column of three front; halting, however, as they did so, in order that no interval might be left in their line of march. Then scarcely had he moved half a yard beyond the spot whereat the wider road commenced, before the tall chief mentioned heretofore, and the man next behind, moved simultaneously, by a quick, pard-like spring to either side of him, and grasped his arms above the elbow with a firm, though not painful pressure. Meanwhile the heavens had brightened somewhat, and he might see that a huge rocky hill, or, as it might have been termed, not inaptly, mountain, rose suddenly, an abrupt and glant barrier, directly in their front. Rough as it was, however, and difficult of access, an hour of constant labor brought them in safety to the summit, where a scene widely different from the bleak herbless crags which with so much of labor they had scaled, presented itself to the Spaniard's eyes. A table of rich fertile land, of many miles circumference, was here outspread upon the ledgy top of the huge hill, which fell abruptly down on every side, a precipice of several hundred feet in sheer descent, accessible alone by steep and zigzag paths, like that up which his weary feet had painfully surmounted its ascent. Groves of the freshest verdure towered high above the black and broken rocks which walled them in on every side; fields richly clothed with the tall maize, rustled and twinkled in the morning air; streamlets of crystal water meandered to and fro until they reached the steep brink whence they plunged in bright and foaming cataracts down to the vale below—and here embosomed in the verdant groves, circled with rich and fertile fields, watered by rills of most translucent water; here, on a summit never before trodden by the feet of European, lay the secluded fastness of the Charib Caonabo—a village larger and more neatly built than any which Hernando had yet seen in the fair island of Hispaniola. Some two, or at the most three hundred cottages, of the low Indian fashion, with roofs thatched by the spreading palm-leaves, and pillared porticoes scattered about in careless groups, irregularly mixed with groves and gardens, were carefully surrounded by a deep ditch, supplied with water from a dam upon a neighboring streamlet; and a stockade composed of massive timbers of the already famous iron-wood, framed with much skill and ingenuity, in imitation of Spanish palisadoes. Columns of smoke were curling gaily upward from every cottage roof, and lights were glancing cheerily from every open door and wide unlatticed casement; and merry voices rang in friendly converse or unthinking song, through the long village streets; but none came forth to greet, or cheer the wounded weary stranger, who was dragged on —right on, wistfully eyeing the bright firesides, and listening with envious ears to the gay sounds of merriment, among which he stood alone and almost hopeless. At length, when he had passed every house—when the lights and sounds had faded into distance, the hand which might be said to bear, rather than now to lead him onward, halted before a towering pile of rock, upon the further verge of the small area of table land contiguous to the stern precipice. A light was procured instantly by one of the inferiors of the tribe, and by it was revealed a natural aperture in the dark rock, defended by a grated wicket, composed, like the stock-side, of massive beams of iron-wood, securely fastened by a lock of Spanish manufacture. A key was instantly produced from the tall chieftain's girdle, and without any word of explanation the gate was opened, the Spaniard's bonds were loosened, a pile of cloaks of the rude native cotton was flung down in a dark recess of the cave—which, by the dim light of the flickering torch, appeared to be of immense magnitude. Hernando was thrust violently in, the torch extinguished, and the gate closed on the moment—locked and double-locked behind him. For a short time he listened to the departing footsteps of his captors, and then, outdone with weariness and woe, muttered his hasty prayers, and throwing himself down at full length on the simple pallet, slept heavily and soundly until the sun of the succeeding day was high in the blue heavens, when he awoke again to recollection of his griefs, and the feverish torture of his wounds. CHAPTER IX. The sun was high in heaven, when Hernando de Leon awoke from the deep but perturbed and restless slumbers which, induced by the fever of his wounds, and the toilsome journey of the preceding day, had fallen on him almost before his limbs were stretched upon their temporary couch. The bright rays streaming in between the massive beams that barred the portal of his dungeon, full of ten thousand dancing motes, had fallen full upon his face, and uncurtained eyelids, dazzling the orbs within; so that when he upstarted from his dreamless sleep, it was a moment or two before he could so far collect his thoughts as to discover where he was, or what had been the circumstances which placed him in that wild abode. By slow degrees, however, the truth dawned on his mind, and with the truth that dull sense of oppression that dense and smothering weight, which to souls of the highest order and most delicate perceptions, seems ever to attend the loss of liberty. For a while, therefore, he brooded gloomily and darkly over the strange events of the past day; the singular mode in which he had been so unexpectedly entrapped, the unexplained and unintelligible conduct of the savages, and, above all, the motives which had influenced them in their treatment of himself. Thence his thoughts strayed, by no unnatural transition, to the mild features and kind ministry of the Charib boy; and when he probed his memory, he clearly recollected him to be one of the slaves of Orozimbo's household, though from this he could draw no plausible conjecture, either for good or evil. After a little space, wandering again, his spirit began to reflect upon the chances of his liberation; nor did he meditate long on this topic, before he came to the conclusion that for his present escape from the hands of the fierce cacique, and for his ultimate return to the settlements of his countrymen, he must rely entirely on his own energies. Hope of assistance from without was evidently desperate. The speed and secresy with which the Indians had conducted their retreat—the ignorance of all his comrades respecting his own movements on that eventful morning—the death, flight, or capture of all those who had been privy to the time or place of his encounter with Herreriro, and above all the great and almost certain probability that some ulterior object, involving inroads on the Spanish posts, of magnitude sufficient to engage their occupants exclusively in their own self-preservation, had drawn the wily Caonabo to such a distance from his usual fastnesses, all these considerations led the young captive to believe that on himself alone, on his own often tried resources, on his own resolute will and unflinching nerves, on his own deep sagacity and dauntless courage, on his own hardihood of heart and corresponding energy of thews and sinews, depended all his hope of extrication from an imprisonment which promised to be long indeed, and painful, unless it should be brought to a more speedy, though no less unwished termination through the medium of a violent and cruel death. Stimulated, by reflections such as these, to something of exertion, Hernando rose from his lowly couch, with the intent of exploring, to the utmost, the secrets of his prison house, which, so far as the uncertain light, checkered and broken by the gratings through which it found its way, permitted him to judge, seemed of considerable depth and magnitude, when, to his great surprise, as he raised himself, he perceived that, during his slumbers, his dungeon had been visited by some one who had left, hard by his pillow, a calabash of pure, cold water, with a slight meal of fruits and the cassava bread, which formed the principal article of nutriment among the simple Indians. So sound, however, had been his sleep, that the noise of opening the heavy creaking gate had fallen unheard and unheeded on his dulled senses To lave his heated brow and hands, in the cool element—to quaff a long, long draught, more soothing, in his present temper, than the most fragrant wines of Xenes, or the yet more renowned and costly Val de Peñas—was his first impulse; but when refreshed and reinvigorated by the innocent cup, he turned to taste the eatables before him, his very soul revolted from the untouched morsel, the rising spasm of the throat, the hysterica passio of poor Lear, convulsed him; and, casting the food from him, he buried his hot aching temples in his hands, and remained for many minutes, plunged, as it were, in a deep stupor—then, by a mighty effort, shaking off the lethargic gloom, he drank again more deeply than before, sprang to his feet, and strode, with firm and rapid steps, several times to and fro the area of his prison, immediately within the wicket, where fell the brightest glances of the half-interrupted sunlight. “Shame, shame!” he cried, at length giving articulate expression to his thoughts— “shame, shame on thee. Hernando!—to pine and give way thus beneath the pressure of so slight an evil—for what is this to thy hard soul-cankering captivity, among the savage paynimry of Spain—where fettered to the floor thou languishedst for nine long months, unvisited by the fair light of Heaven. Shame! it must not be!” and he manned himself, upon the instant, by a single effort, and, turning from the light, explored with cautious scrutiny each nook and angle of the cavern. It was of large extent, wide, deep, and full of irregular recesses; and seemed to have been used as a species of magazine, or store-house; for piles of dried fish, baskets of wicker-work heaped with the golden ears of maize, or roots of the cassava, cumbered the floor; while on rude shelves were stowed away the simple fabric of the Indian broom, mattings, and rolls of cotton cloth, fantastically dyed, and in one—the most secret—nook, protected by a wooden door, a mass of glittering ornaments, some wrought of the purest gold, and others of the adulterated metal, which the savages termed guanin, breast-plates, and crowns and bracelets, enough to have satisfied the avarice insatiate of a Pizarro or a Cortez. Nor were these all; for visible amid the darkness, by the rays which their own gorgeous substance concentrated, lay bars, and ingots and huge wedges, of the virgin metal, beside a pile of unwrought ore, gleaming with massy veins, of value utterly uncalculable. Slight was the glance which the young Spaniard cast upon these more than kingly treasures—a single crevice opening to the outer air had been to him a discovery more precious than the concentrated wealth of all the mighty mines of the new world—a single coat of plate, with helm and buckler, and a good Spanish blade to match them, he would have clutched with hands that scorned the richer metal—but these were not; and he turned from the cacique's treasury with a heedless air, to resume his hitherto unprofitable search. Not far did he go, however, before another wooden door presented itself, closed only by an artificial latch, which yielded instantly to his impatient fingers. It opened—and before him extended a huge and stately hall, for such it seemed, wide as the cloistered chancel of some gothic pile, and loftier; walled, paved and vaulted by the primeval hand of nature, first and unrivalled architect, with the eternal granite—not as the outer chamber, obscure, or dimly seem by half-excluded daylight—but flooded with pure, all-pervading sunshine, which poured in unpolluted and unveiled, through the vast natural arch which terminated the superb arcade. His heart leaped, as it seemed, with the vast joy of the moment, into his very throat! All suffering, all anxiety, all woe was instantly forgotten! for he was free! free as the fresh summer wind that was tossed round his head, rife with the perfumes of a thousand flowing hills! free as the glowing sunshine that streamed through that broad portal! With a quick step, and bounding pulse, he leaped towards the opening! he reached!—he stood upon the threshold! Wherefore that sudden start? wherefore that ashy pallor pervading brow and cheek and lip? One other step, and he had been precipitated hundreds of feet from the sheer verge of the huge rock, which fell a perpendicular descent of ninety fathom, down to the cultured plains below! His feet were now tottering on the very brink, and it required more than an ordinary effort of his strong active frame to check the impulse of his forward motion, which had been so impetuously swift, that but a little more would have sufficed to hurl him into the empty air. With a dull leaden weight that sudden disappointment crushed down the burning aspirations of his soul—his heart fell sick within him; he clasped his hands over his throbbing temples—he was again a captive! It was, however, but for a moment he was unmanned. Before a second had elapsed, he was engaged with all his energies, in the examination of the smallest peculiarities of the place, hoping, alas! in vain, that he should still discover there some path whereby to quit his prison-house; but not the faintest track—not the most slight projection, whereon to plant a foot, was there—above, below, to right and left of that huge arch, the massy precipice was smooth and hard and slippery as glass— and, after a minute inspection, the Spaniard was reluctantly compelled to own to his excited hopes, which fain would have deceived themselves, that nothing had been gained by his discovery beyond the power of gazing forth over the beauties of that boundless scene, which stretched away, for miles and miles, beneath his feet to the blue waters of the ocean, which lost themselves in turn in the illimitable azure of the cloudless skies. Wistfully did he strain his eyes over the wide-spread plain, which from that lofty eminence showed, map-like and distinct, its every variation of hill, or sloping upland, tangled ravine, or broad and fertile valley, clearly delineated by the undulations of those mighty shadows which—thrown by the strong sunshine from a hundred sweeping clouds—careered like giant beings over the glittering landscape. Suddenly, while he yet lingered over this distant prospect, a faint sound burst on his ear—a sound oft heard and unforgotten; though so faint that now it scarcely rose above the whisper of the breeze waving the myriad tree-tops of that untrodden solitude; and the small voice of the far river whose angry roar was mellowed, by the influence of distance, into a soft and soothing murmur. He started, and glanced hurriedly around—again that sound—nearer and clearer than before—the remote din of ordnance! Towards the east he gazed, and there, winding their way through the calm waters in close propinquity to the green margin of the isle, he saw four caravellas, with every snow-white sail spread to the favoring gales, with fluttering signals streaming from their mastheads, and by their oft repeated salvos, soliciting the notice of their countrymen. It was— it was, past doubt, the squadron of Columbus— long wished for, and arrived too late! Hopeless although he was, he watched those caravellas with a gaze as eagerly solicitous as that which the benighted sailor keeps on the beacon of his safety—while, one by one, they were lost to his sight behind some towering promontory, and re-appeared again, each after each, glittering forth with all their white sails shimmering in the meridian light. At length he might behold them shortening sail, as though their haven was at hand, and by and by they shot into the shadow of a wide wood-crowned hill; and, though the watcher kept his post until the sun was bending down towards the western verge of the horizon, they issued not again upon the azure waters, beyond that mass of frowning verdure. With a heart sicker than before, he had already turned away, in order to go back into the outer cavern, when a sharp whizzing sound beside him attracted his attention, and ere he could look around the long shaft of a Charib arrow splintered itself against the rocky archway, and fell in fragments at his feet. The first glance of the dauntless Spaniard was outward, to descry, if possible, the archer who had launched that missile, and with so true an aim! Nor was he long in doubt— for perched on a projecting crag of the same line of cliffs, wherein was perforated the wide cave within the mouth of which he stood, a hundred yards, at the least calculation, distant, he saw the Charib Orozimbo. A quiver was suspended from his shoulders, and a long Indian bow was yet raised in his right hand, to the level of his eye; but by the friendly wafture of his left, he seemed to deprecate the notion that he was hostilely inclined. Again he waved his hand aloft, pointed towards the broken arrow, and turning hastily away, was out of sight before Hernando could reply to his brief amicable gestures. As soon as he had roused his scattered energies of mind, the youthful Spaniard turned his attention to the fragments of the splintered shaft, and instantly discovered a small packet securely fastened to the flint head. Tearing it hence with eager haste—couched in the Spanish tongue, and traced upon the scrap of parchment by a remembered hand—he read the following sentences:— “Be of good cheer—friends are about us. When the moon sets to-night, watch at the cavern mouth—a clue of thread shall be conveyed to thee, by which thou shalt draw up a cord sufficient for thy weight—means of escape shall wait thee at the cliff's foot. These, through the Charib Orozimbo, from thine, Alonzo.” CHAPTER IX. He tore the billet on the instant into the smallest fragments, and lest some prying eyes should fall on its contents, scattered it piecemal, through the rocky porch to the free winds of heaven. This done he looked about him carefully for some projection of the rock whereunto he might fix the rope, on which he was to wing his flight down that precipitous abyss, that no time might be wasted when the appointed hour should come, for the adventure; and soon discovered a tall stalactitic pillar, close to the brink of the descent, the strength of which he tested by the exertion of his utmost power. Satisfied now, that he had nothing more to do, but to avoid suspicion, and to await the action of his friends without, he returned instantly to the exterior cave—secured the door with care, and dragging back the cotton mattress on which he had slept the preceding night into the darkest angle of the prison, stretched himself on it to expect, as patiently as might be, the approach of evening. Not long had he lain there, before a grim-visaged old wrinkled warrior entered with a supply of food and water. Without a word, this tawny jailor deposited his load on the rocky floor, and then, with uncouth courtesy, applied fresh bandages, besmeared with some sweet-scented Indian salve, which acted almost magically to the refreshment of the wound upon the wrist, which had been pierced by the Charib arrow. Having done this, he peered about with silent scrutiny, into each angle and recess of the cave-dungeon, and then, having severely tested the strength of the wooden barriers, swung to and locked the heavy lattice, and departed. Slowly the hours of daylight lagged away, but to the slowest and the longest term its end must come, and gradually the long shadows, which the setting sun threw over that green landscape, melted into the dimness of the universal gloom, and one by one the stars came out in the dark azure firmament, and all was still and sweet and breathless. Anon, the moon came forth, climbing the arch of heaven in her pure beauty, and bathing all on earth in peaceful glory. It seemed, to the excited spirits of Hernando, as if she never would complete her transit over the deep blue skies, and it was with no small exertion that he compelled himself to wait the time appointed. Well for him was it that he did so! for when she attained her central height, a band of dusky warriors, with the great cacique Caonabo at their head, well armed with spears and war-clubs, and equipped with many and bright torches, paused at the grated entrance, and summoned him to show himself to them, his captors. After this measure, evidently of precaution, he was left quite alone, shortly after, he fell asleep for a short space, although his slumbers were disturbed and broken; and the moon had not set, although her lower limb was sinking fast into the forest when he awoke. Cautiously he peered out through the dungeon gate to see that all was still without, ere he should seek his post, then, satisfied that no spies were upon the watch, he noiselessly unclosed the inner door, fastened it softly after him, and stealing through the larger cavern, showed his tall figure in the archway just as the last ray of the moon glanced on the cliffs around him, ere he should disappear. She sank, and all was gloom. A moment—a shrill sharp whistle rang on the night air, and again a shaft whizzed by him and fell harmless. A slight thread was attached to it, which, fathom after fathom, drew in, until a stronger line supplied its place, and next a stout cord, and at length, the promised rope! With eager hands, he gathered it link after link, coil after coil, fastened it to the lofty stalactite, and, after having tried, by a sudden jerk, the safety of the knot, leaned forth over the rocky brink to see if thence he might descry aught of his trusty friends. Diminished by the distance into a twinkling gleam, scarce larger than the fire-fly's spark, at the crag's base, there blazed a single torch, and, this slight glimmer seen, without one word or doubt, the dauntless youth grasped the stout cable, and launched himself over the perilous brink into the viewless bosom of the air. The rope had been prepared with knots at each foot of its length, through every one of which was thrust a tough bamboo, forming a rude extempore step-ladder; yet, though facilitated somewhat, the descent into that black, and as it seemed, bottomless abyss, was still perilous in the extreme, and yet less perilous than fearful. Steadily, however, did Hernando, grasping the short rungs with an iron gripe, and planting his feet one by one, descend that fearful ladder; nor, till he stood unscathed on the firm soil below, did his brain reel, or his stout nerves tremble; and there, recovering from the transient tremor and bewilderment that fell upon him, he found himself clasped in the fond arms of the faithful Guarica, while round them gathered the bold page, Alonzo, and Orozimbo, the true Charib boy, Guarica's youthful brother; who had alone, designed with skill and with success, accomplished this desperate adventure of escape. CHAPTER X. Brief time had the young Spaniard and his Indian princess for explanation, or for converse, for while she was yet clasped to his grateful breast in the first sweet embrace of love, a long, wild yell rang far into the bosom of the night from the cave's mouth above, and the broad glare of a hundred torches, tumultuously brandished by as many strong and savage hands, disclosed to the eyes of the astounded fugitives the fierce cacique himself, surrounded by the flower of his wild chivalry, armed at all points, with bow and buckler, war-club and javelin, and pike, thronging the rocky threshold of that deserted dungeon. Each swarthy figure stood out revealed on that bold eminence like animated sculptures of the far-famed Corinthian brass; the sinewy frames, the well developed muscles, nay! more, the very features of every stern cacique, the plumy crowns, and pictured quivers, all clearly visible and palpably defined against the fierce red glow which formed the back ground to that animated picture. Brief time was there, indeed! for instantly discovering the mode by which the fugitive had left his place of confinement, and guessing that his flight was but recent—for though the crimson glare of their resinous torches rendered the group above as visible as daylight could have done, it lacked the power to penetrate the gloom which veiled the little knot of beings at the base of that huge precipice,—two of the boldest of the great cacique's followers addressed themselves to the pursuit by the same fearful and precarious ladder; while many others might be seen casting aside the heavier portions of their dress and armature, and girding up their loins for a similar purpose. “Haste, haste, Hernando,” whispered the Indian maiden, in a voice that fairly trembled with agitation—“haste to yon thicket by the stream—fly thou, Alonzo, and unbind the horses! Come, Orozimbo—brother!” And, as she spoke grasping her lover by the arm, she hurried him away to a dense mass of thorny brushwood, which, overcanopied with many a vine and many a tangled creeper, clothed the banks of a wide, brawling streamlet, flowing with a loud incessant murmur, though in a slender volume, over a bed of gravel, and small rocky fragments, detached, in the lapse of ages, from the tall crag that overhung it H re, fastened to the branches, stood three Spanish chargers, equipped with the lightest housings then in use, except that one, in addition to the saddle, was provided with a velvet cushion attached to the cantle, and kept in its place by a thong, securing it to the richly plated crupper. “Mount, mount, Alonzo,” cried the maiden; “stay not to hold your master's stirrup; mount, and delay not! Every minute now is worth a human life!” While yet the words were on her lips, the page had leaped into his saddle, and swinging her slight form, with scarce an effort, to the croup of the tall charger, Hernando, without setting foot in stirrup, vaulted into the saddle before her, grasped the reins firmly with a practised hand, and stirring his steed's mettle with the spur, rode a few paces down the channel of the stream, till he had reached a place clear from the overbowering brushwood. The boy Alonzo followed hard on his traces, leading the third horse by the bridle at his side. “Where—oh where tarries Orozimbo?” whispered again the Charib maiden, in a sweet low voice of her native tongue—“without him, all is naught!” Ere she had finished speaking, they cleared the thicket, and by the strong illumination of the lights above, a fearful scene was rendered visible. The foremost two of the pursuers were half way down the ladder, while three of their followers had commenced their perilous descent, and were now hanging to the topmost rungs! Where—where was Orozimbo? A sharp twang broke the silence which had succeeded to the yell of the infuriate Indians. A keen, sharp ringing twang! a hurtling sound as of some missile in quick motion, followed —a long, dark streak was seen almost immediately glancing within the circling radiance of the torches, towards the leading Charib—at the next instant he relaxed his hold—a piercing yell of anguish and despair pealed up to the dark heavens—headforemost the tawny savage plunged earthward—and the soft, heavy plashing noise announced, as plainly as the clearest words could tell, that not one bone remained unbroken after that fearful fall! Another twang—and yet another!—and almost simultaneously, with the small, shrill voice of the fatal cord, another, and another of the wretched Indians, transfixed by the unerring shafts of Orozimbo, were precipitated—one shrieking hopelessly but incessantly through the deaf air, until the awful crash finished his cries and agonies together—one mute in his stern despair—from their slight foothold; while daunted by the deadly archery of their unseen enemy, and ignorant how many foes were launching death at every shot among them, the survivors retreated up the ladder, with wild haste, and when they reached the summit, a long drawn yell, strangely expressive of malice frustrated, and disappointed vengeance, told those who heard it from below that they abandoned that precarious method of pursuit. Another moment, and the light passed from the verge, and a loud burst of dissonant and angry voices, receding rapidly, betokened that the pursuers had turned off to seek some easier exit from the hill-fortress. Secured thus, by the bravery and foresight of her stripling brother, from a pursuit so instantaneous that escape would have been scarce possible, Guarica called aloud, no longer fearing to betray their proximity to the enemy by her words: “Hasten, good brother, hasten! We tarry for thee, Orozimbo,” and guided by the accents of her well known voice, panting from the rapidity of his previous motions, and from agitation in a scarcely less degree, with his full quiver rattling on his naked shoulders, and the long bow, which had of late done such good service, swinging at his back, the Charib boy darted down the slight declivity, and, wreathing his hand lightly in the courser's mane, bounded at once upon his back. “Follow, Guarica; follow me close: there is no time for words,” he exclaimed, as he snatched the bridle, and dashing at once into a gallop, drove down the pebbly channel of the stream—the small stones and water flashing high into the air at every stroke of the fleet steed, and indicating to Hernando the direction which his guide had taken. No easy task was it, however, to ride down that wild water-course; for though the streamlet was so shallow that it barely reached the horses' knees, the rugged inequalities of its bed—here thickly interspersed with rough and craggy fragments, here paved with slippery boulders, and there with broad smooth ledges of hard slaty rock, polished by the incressant rippling of the current, till ice itself hardly would have afforded a less treacherous foothold—rendered it perilous indeed, save to a cavalier of the first order to put a horse to his speed among its numerous obstacles. At first, the youthful Spaniard could not conceive the cause which should have tempted Orozimbo to lead him by so strange a path; but busy as he was in holding up and guiding the stout charger which nobly bore his double freight, his mind was actively employed: and almost on the instant, remembering the instinct, scarcely inferior to the scent of the sagacious bloodhound, with which the Charib tribes were wont to follow on the track of any fugitive, he saw the wisdom of this singular precaution. For something more than two hours they dashed on unwearied, though the sparkling waters, which, driven far aloft, had draggled all their garments from the buskin to the very plume—the stream now wending in bold curves through rich and fair savannahs, now driving into the most devious shades of underwood and forest. Still on dashed, rousing the wild fowl from their sedgy haunts on the stream's margin, scaring the birds of night from their almost impervious roosts, till now the stars began to pale their ineffectual fires, and a faint streak on the eastern sky to tell of coming day. They reached a smooth green vega, broader than any they had passed or seen, and here, for the first time, Orozimbo paused from his headlong race. “All is well, now, Guarica—pursuit is far behind; two leagues hence, just beyond that fringe of wood which you may see glooming dark against the opening morn, tarry your gallant kinsmen, Don Hernando. Many will blame us for the deeds which we have wrought in thy behalf, young Spaniard. All our countrymen must hate us, and if we 'scape this 'venture, our future home must be within the scope of Spain's all-powerful protection. All peril is over now for a space, and if thou art weary, my sweet sister, here may we rest awhile.” “No, no!” Guarica interrupted him, breathless from the wild speed at which they had thus far journeyed. “No, no! no, no! we will not pause till we have reached the cavaliers.” “At least, however,” interposed Hernando, using the Indian tongue, which was no less familiar to him than his native language—“at least, let us, if we be free from present danger, ride somewhat gently, in order that our steeds may so regain their wind, and be in ease again to bear us stoutly, if aught should call for fresh exertion of mettle.” “Be it so,” answered Orozimbo, turning his horse's head, and riding as he spoke up the green margin of the rivulet, till he stood on the level meadow, where he was joined by his companions—“Be it so. Well I am assured no foeman could have followed with such speed as to be less than two leagues distant in our rear—and on this open plain none can approach us undetected. One hour's advance will bring us to a band of horsemen, under the bold Ojeda, that would contemn the might of Caonabo's tribe.” Taking the lead once more, he trotted gently forward, the daylight brightening more and more till the great sun burst from the cloudy veil that curtained his bright orient chamber, and filled the earth with lustre and rejoicing. Love, which, oppressed by doubt, anxiety, and care, had been remembered only to aggravate their sorrows and increase their apprehensions, resumed, beneath that gladsome light, its more legitimate and wonted functions, and, before many moments had elapsed, Hernando was recounting to the attentive ears of the sweet Indian girl his confident and certain expectations of an immediate termination to all the obstacles which had thus far opposed their union, while he inquired eagerly into the late mysterious history of his surprise, imprisonment, and rescue. Few words sufficed to make all clear. Chance, alone—blind and sudden chance—had brought about his capture—a chance which had in fact preserved the Spanish settlements from certain peril— probable destruction. Apprised, as has been mentioned heretofore, of the relaxed discipline and contemptuous negligence of military usages which had crept on the garrison during the absence of its great commander, the wily Charib had assembled all his bold tributary hordes, and was even then in full march to commence an onslaught on walls which he most assuredly would have found mounted with culverins unloaded and watched—or unwatched rather— by sentinels unarmed and sleeping. And despite the exertions of Guarica, had the assailants not been delayed by the arrival of the duellists, and the protracted conflict which held the Charibs gazing in mute wonder, Ojeda's tidings would have been all too late to save the city from surprise. As it was, he arrived just in time; and the report of Caonabo's scouts, who reported the garrison to be so thoroughly on the alert that it was clear they must have received intelligence, determined the cacique to retreat instantly, and wait a better opportunity. Hernando's eyes had not deceived him; for it was in truth Orozimbo, whom he had seen disputing with Caonabo; and, as he surmised, it was concerning himself that the argument was maintained so angrily; the young man insisting on his release, and his uncle, maddened by his disappointment, refusing positively to keep the word which he had plighted for his safety. This refusal perhaps it was which, awakening a generous indignation on the boy's part, determined him, yet more than his sympathy in his beloved sister's affection, to effect by one means or other the escape of the young Spaniard. In this intent, he judged it best to accompany the band on their march; and to carry out his plans better he appeared to acquiesce in his uncle's views, and avoided all communication with, or apparent interest in the prisoner. Within half an hour of the capture, however, he contrived to send off news of what had happened to his sister, by a messenger on whom he could rely, desiring her to seek aid from the very man to whom she was most willing to apply, Alonzo de Ojeda; and to meet him prepared with horses, and with Spanish aid at hand, the next morning at a point which he indicated. Arrived at the hill fortress, he easily obtained the release of Alonzo, on whom the Charibs set no value, on condition that he should be blindfolded until he was some miles distant from the fort. This once conceded, he seemingly gave up all further interest in Hernando; and, on pretence of conveying the boy homeward, had an interview with his father and Ojeda, arranged all the further particulars of the escape, and conducted it with an energy and skill which ensured its complete success. The only danger that remained now to be apprehended was that some roving band, several of which Orozimbo knew to be out, might discover the bivouac of Ojeda's horsemen, and, suspecting an escape, attempt to ambush the fugitives. Of this, however, there appeared to be little risk, conducted, as their flight had been, with so much craft and discretion. And now the wide savannah was already passed, and at the verge of the forest, within a short half mile of the spot where Ojeda waited their arrival, with ears and soul intent on every sound that might betoken their approach, they had to cross a narrow streamlet, running between deep and wooded banks. Orozimbo, who was their guide, still led the way, and was in the middle of the ford, while Hernando with the maiden was descending the steep path which led to it, when the well known twang of the Indian bow was heard, and an arrow whizzed through the air, so truly aimed that it passed through the Spaniard's high crowned hat. “Push on,” cried the quick-witted youth upon the instant; “push on, boy, to close quarters,” and, as he spoke, snatching a pistol from his holster, he dashed his spurs into his horse's flanks, and passing Orozimbo in mid channel, drove up the opposite ascent, followed by his page, sword in hand. Then from the brushwood rose a loud, wild yell, accompanied by a flight of long Charib shafts—close to the head and breast of De Leon they hurtled, but none took effect on him, or on Alonzo. A sharp cry rang, however, from the rear, followed almost immediately by a splash in the shallow water, and then, with bridle loose and bloodstained housings, the steed of Orozimbo darted at a fierce gallop onward. Scarce had Hernando reached the brow of the ravine before, with levelled pikes and brandished war-clubs, a dozen Charibs rushed against him; and one, more daring than his fellows, seized on his bridle rein. Not half a second did he keep his hold, for, levelled at a hand's breadth of his head, Hernando's pistol flashed with unerring aim —the bullet crashed through the Indian's temples, and he fell without a word or a groan, beneath the charger's feet. Rising upon the instant in his stirrups, the bold cavalier hurled, with a sure and steady hand, the discharged weapon in the face of his next opponent. Then, before he had seen the effect, although it felled the savage stunned and headlong to the earth, he unsheathed his trusty rapier with one hand, while with the other, casting his bridle loose, he drew and discharged fatally his second pistol. All this had passed with the speed of light, and Alonzo, having at the same time cut down the first of his assailants, the Indians broke away on all sides, and it seemed as if they might have effected their escape; and so in fact they might have done, had the young Spaniard chosen to abandon Orozimbo to his fate; but such was not his nature. Reining his charger sharply up, he turned his head, and called aloud upon the faithful Indian. At the same point of time the Charibs, who had scattered diverse before his headlong charge, began again to rally, and one, the boldest of their number, fitting an arrow to his bow-string, drew it with steady and swift aim quite to the head, the cord twanged sharply, and the shaft took effect right in the broad breast of Hernando's war horse, transfixing his embroidered poitrel. Headlong he fell to earth, and as he fell, the savages, gaining fresh courage, made a simultaneous rush upon the hapless rider. So speedily, however, had the skilful soldier regained his foothold, and so powerfully did he wield his rapier, that they still feared to close with him absolutely. Not so, however, with the fair Guarica, for dislodged from her seat by the shock of the charger's downfall, she had been thrown to some yards distance and seized, as soon as she had touched the ground, by a gigantic savage, who all athirst forvengeance and for blood, brandished his ponderous war-club round his head in the very act to smite, while hampered by their numerous foemen, neither Hernando nor the page could possibly assist her at this fearful crisis. Just at this moment, the fast, thick-beating tramp of many horses at full gallop was heard by both parties, and the continuous crashing of the brushwood, through which a band of Europeans was, it was evident, advancing. The near sound, it would seem, inspired both parties with fresh vigor—the savages trying to finish their fell work before they should be interrupted—the Spaniards gaining confidence and hope from the vicinity of friends. Too late, however, would the arrival of Ojeda on the scene of action have proved to save Guarica, though now he might be even within two hundred yards, plying his bloody spurs, and brandishing aloft his formidable rapier. Thrice did Hernando rush upon the Indians in the vain hope of succoring his promised bride, striking down at each charge a Charib warrior; but each time he was driven back by force of irresistible numbers; and nothing could have saved her from sure death, had not a bloody form, ghastly, deathstricken, arisen like a spectre from the channel of the stream—armed with a Spanish blade—faithful in death itself, young Orozimbo! Though faint and staggering, he plied his keen sword with such mortal energy, that all shrank back from its downright descent. The chief who had seized Guarica, and whose averted head beheld not the approach of this new combatant, received the full sway of its sheer edge on his bended neck. Through muscle, spine, and marrow, the trenchant blade drove unresisted. Loosing his grasp upon his captive, he dropped dead without a word or struggle; and carried onward by his own impetus, the Charib boy fell over him, and lay beside him in his blood—motionless, although living still. A second more, and with their battle cry, “Saint Jago!” the fiery Spaniards were upon them—with flash, and shot, and stab, and stroke, till not an enemy remained alive upon the bank of the small stream, which, late so pure and lucid, flowed now all dark, curdled, and thick with human gore. Ere yet the mortal struggle was well over, Hernando caught Guarica to his arms, and the page Alonzo upraised the body of her faithful brother from the earth, and wiped the foam and gore from his pale lips, while the stern Spaniards stood around, mute and awe-stricken, leaning on the weapons which reeked yet with the homicidal witness. One form was there beside Alonzo de Ojeda, on whom Hernando's eyes, engrossed by the sad spectacle before him, had not yet fallen—a tall and noble form, gorgeously clad in scarlet, with much lace and embroidery of gold. But it was not the gorgeous dress, scarlet, nor lace, nor gold, but the long locks of snow shading that broad and massive brow—the air of conscious dignity and inborn worth, the impress of unutterable thought united to invincible resolve, that stamped upon that face and figure a natural majesty exceeding that of princes—a majesty becoming the discoverer of worlds! Silent he stood, and sorrowful; while the boy Orozimbo, placing the fair hand of his sister, who, with her lover, knelt above him in speechless agony of woe, in that of the young Spaniard, strove hard but fruitlessly, against the grasp of death, which wa now grappling with his very soul, to give his feelings sound—gasping forth something of which naught could be heard but the words—“Take her, love and protect”—his eyes rolled wildly, as he struggled to fix them on the beloved brow of her for whom he was dying—his lips were fearfully convulsed, and with one murmur—“Sister—sister!” he sank upon the earth, as still and senseless as its least valued clod. Then that great man broke silence— “This is the visible and present hand of God! Take her, Hernando—she is yours— yours in the face of man and before God! Take her to be your wife, for ever and forever—and as to her you do prove faithful, true, and loving—so may it be with you and yours, here and hereafter!” And the wide forest aisles re-echoed to the deep “Amen,” which burst impressively from the stern lips of the Spanish warriors. The tenderness of her espoused lord effaced, in time, the cloud from the fair Indian's brow; and if the source of their first early love was troubled, so was it not in its meridian tide! Happy they lived, and honored, and when at length they paid the debt, which all must pay to nature, it was among the tears of children so numerous and noble, that to this very day many, the grandest of Spain's nobility, are proud to claim descent from Hernando de Leon and his bright Charib Bride! THE END.</field>
