      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. THE TWO MAIDENS. The readers of the nautical romance entitled `Freemantle, or the Privateersman,' to which the present story is a sequel, will remember that the narrative closed with the landing of Freemantle and the passengers of the Indiaman at the villa of Colonel Hood, while the Indiaman stood on towards the port of Boston. The disabled and defeated corvette at the same time, it will be remembered, was making the best of her way towards Halifax, closely followed off soundings by the Privateer, which then had orders to put back into port. The meeting between Colonel Hood and his old and long-absent friend, Mr. Forrest, the India-merchant, was warm and ardent as became the re-union of such tried friends. The meeting of the two maidens for the first time was attended with a little natural embarrassment; but the sincerity and frank hospitality of Mary Hood in five minutes quite won the heart of the handsome Indian belle, and a union like that of sisterly hearts was at once established between them. Being both nearly of an age, and from the long friendship existing between their parents, they had been, as it were, well known to one another from childhood. They had sent messages of love one to the other, in their father's letters far over the sea; and presents had been interchanged. Yet till now they had never met; and the meeting was to both of the deepest interest. While the two old gentlemen sat together upon the portico after the first interchange of courtesies and affections had passed, talking of the past, as old friends will when they meet after a long absence, the blue-eyed Mary Hood, and her new dark-eyed friend were standing by a window gazing into each other's eyes and studying fondly the features which each had a hundred times dreamed of. `I was sure your eyes were hazel, dear Clara,' said Mary smiling into them through her own. `I knew yours were blue, and that your hair was a soft brown, and that your face was very fair, but I did not expect to find you so lovely as you are,' said Clara admiring, the gentle beauty of the blooming northern maiden. `How did you know so much, Clara?' said Mary blushing at this deserved compliment to her loveliness; `If you are such a flatterer I shall begin! Your glorious beauty I did not even dream of, noble Clara!— Such magnificent eyes, and your complexion so soft, like the most delicate olive, and with such a bright ruby glow to your lips!' `Your figure too, so superb and yet so gracefully child-like in all its motions. And —' `You shall be silent, fair prattler,' cried the East Indian maiden, her rich cheek coloring high with these glowing descriptions of her person; `you asked me how I knew you had blue eyes and fair hair and then did not wait for me to reply.' `How then did you hear, for I am sure father did not write so much, for if he was asked he would scarcely be able to tell whether my eyes were blue or brown; so long as he knows they beam affection upon him he scarce heeds their hue.' `It was not your father, Mary,' answered Clara with emphasis. `Who then could it be?' demanded Miss Hood, looking her friend in the face with curiosity. The young East Indian made no reply in words; but directing her eyes with a quick glance to the piazza where Freemantle and Henry Hood were standing each with a glass at his eye, watching the receding vessels, she smiled and looked very significant. The gaze of Miss Hood followed the glance and rested upon the slight, but elegant and manly figure of the youthful privateersman. `It could not have been this brave officer?' ventured Mary, believing she interpreted aright Miss Forrest's looks. `Do you remember that he has ever seen you before to-day?' `No!' `Have you any recollection of having met him?' `No!' `Then how could it be he?' `You have puzzled me!' `No. It was he. I heard it from him, Mary,' she added in a low tone, `that you had fair brown hair and soft blue eyes. I could not believe him, for I had never seen a blue-eyed maiden! In India all eyes are lustrously black! `Where did he see me? Where and when did he tell you this, Clara?' asked Mary, her eyes resting with scarcely conscious interest upon the form of the young man. `You ask me three questions in a breath,' said Miss Forrest laughing: `but I will try and gratify your curiosity. Where did he tell it me? It was in India. When did he tell it me? It was last year!' `Then you have seen him in India! I thought you only met the first time to day!' `Oh no; but do not speak so loudly. I would rather this were a secret between us. All friends have secrets, and we must have them. Let this be one!' `I will not breathe it!' Now where did he see me?' `What a truant memory you have, dear Mary! Do you remember visiting a ship of war a year or a year and a half ago it may be?' `In Boston Harbor?' `Yes. I dare say it was!' `Yes!' `As you left the ship some accident occurred by which the boat filled with water, and left you with others floating upon the surface. Was it not so?' `Oh, yes,' answered the young girl with emotion. `I shall never forget that moment. I sank beneath the surface. I remember how I felt as my eyes rested for the last time, as I believed, upon the green and beautiful earth and pleasant blue sky! `Yet you were rescued!' `Yes, by one of the midshipmen who sprung over to save me!' `Did you see his face?' `No. When I came to myself he was not near me. I was only told that I had been saved by a youth. I would have called him to thank him but my father hurried me on shore!' `Did you hear his name?' `It was Freeman, I think my father said. I have always felt grateful to this unknown youth and should be happy to meet and thank him.' `It was not Freeman, but Freemantle! There is your preserver now conversing so cheerfully with your pale, intellectual-looking brother.' `Is it possible?' exclaimed the maiden. `Why do you turn so pale!' `It is with surprise and grateful emotion. `Do not fly to thank him, there will be time enough by and by,' said Clara laughing. `You now know who told me you had blue eyes as well as who saved you from drowning.' `I wonder he should recollect seeing me but once, and under such circumstances.' `Norman is very observing. Besides your beauty made an impression upon him! Doubtless you would have had him at your feet, Mary, if I had not managed to steal his true love.' `And are you lover's?' `Dont breathe it to the winds!' `How mysterious you are, Clara! Is there a secret?' `Yes. I will tell you by and by!' `What, when you first saw him, and how he happened to fall in love with you?' `Yes!' `And the mystery? Will you unfold that?' `All to you, but to no other ear!' `I can keep it secret! How very noble and brave he is, Clara,' said the young girl, gazing admiringly upon the profile of the young man, as he stood upon the piazza conversing with Henry. `Is his name Norman?' `Yes; Norman Freemantle!' `Is he a New England young man?' `Yes, but connected with a noble English family!' `How happy you must be to have so handsome and brave a lover,' sighed Mary, as she contrasted the young privateersman with Herbert Vincent whom she loved without esteeming him. `You sigh, Mary! You must not fall in love with Norman now! It is too late! We must not be rivals!' `I rival you, Clara!' `Why, do you take me in earnest, child! I fear not Norman, however I might fear your beauty. I know, too, you would not let your heart be interested where you knew to love would be to love unrequited! Have you no lover, Mary?' asked the beautiful East Indian, archly. The deep blush that mantled the cheek and the brow of the lovely blonde, betrayed all that her friend sought. `Who is it, Mary?' `My cousin, Herbert!' `The young man who has gone up to the city in the merchant-ship?' `Yes!' `I noticed him! He it was that first told my father that this was Colonel Hood's villa. So he is to be your husband some day!' `I do not know,' laughed and sighed Mary, both at the same time. `As we are to be friends I will make you my confidant,' said the young girl who had never had a confidant in her life, and whose heart was now ready to pour itself forth with all its riches into the bosom of her friend. `I will be a trusty confidant, Mary. What is this love tale?' `Herbert is my cousin, and we have loved each other from childhood. The sisterly love of our younger days ripened into a deeper feeling and we betrothed ourselves. Then Herbert was all that was honorable and upright. I loved and esteemed him! Nay, I almost worshipped him. He was a junior officer in the naval service of his country. He there yielded to evil habits, and truth and principle, and all that makes man noble and loved by woman departed from him. He was degraded from the navy. He came to me and to my father and brother! They turned away from him. I did so too though my heart was breaking!' `Poor child!' said the East Indian, in tones of sweet sympathy, while starry tears danced in her large dark eyes. `They forbade him to visit us unless he formally withdrew his pretensions to my hand, which my father and brother had once recognized. He promised to do so, and was once more received as a visiter; but on those colder terms which the change in his character seemed to demand at their hands.' `And you, Mary?' `I also, tried to imitiate their coldness, but my heart was still warm with that affection which had its root in the innocence of childhood.— He discovered the true state of my heart, and availing himself of it privately reserved his vows of love and I listened with joy!' `Had his character changed any then for the better?' `I know not—I asked not! I knew he was not all I would have him! I knew he had forfeited the esteem of my brother and of my father, and had been publicly degraded. Still I loved him!' `And did you also feel proud of him as you once did?' `Oh, no, I condemned my attachment while I gave myself up to it!— Yesterday he proposed to me to elope with him?' `And what was your answer?' `I have yet given him none!' `Alas, Mary, I pity you! You must not throw yourself away upon one unworthy of you. You must give him a firm denial. I will try to see if I cant cure you of this dangerous poison! Oh, that this Herbert were the mirror of truth and honor, like yonder noble youth!' `I would he were, indeed,' responded the maiden, with a deep sigh, as Henry and Freemantle entered the parlor and approached them. `My story you shall have this evening,' said Clara, as she met for an instant the down cast glance of the maiden; and as she spoke she dropped the shaded lids of her own dark, oriental eyes before the ardent gaze of the young privateersman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. THE LOVER. There could not be presented a stronger contrast than that exhibited by the two young men who now entered from the piazza. The bold, frank air of Freemantle, his fiery eye and look of decision, marked him as a man of an active and daring life. The calm, quiet, intellectual appearance of Henry Hood, the almost feminine softness of his manners, though his character was firm and his courage unquestioned, stamped him as a recluse; as a man who shrinks from the world and who lives with books rather than with men. The dark cloth of his coat contrasted strikingly with the picturesque and armed costume of the young seaman. Although so opposite in habits and pursuits, a a mutual regard seemed, all at once, to have sprung up between the two young men, and they entered the room laughing and talking on terms of the most cordial intimacy. The eye of Freemantle sought that of the fair East Indian, with a speaking glance that was eloquent with passionate love. Clara's eyes dropped beneath the gaze, while her bosom throbbed with emotions of sweet joy. Long had been the separation between her and Norman; and that day they had met again under circumstances calculated to increase, if possible, her strong attachment to him. They had not been together alone for a moment since they had met on board the Indiaman, and both were anxious for an opportunity to arrive when they might, unobserved, interchange their hearts deep feelings. `Your presence here, Miss Forrest,' said Henry, taking her hand with a blush of embarrassment, `will make quite a revolution in our quiet household! Mary will grow wild with joy, and I dare say we shall all sympathise in her happiness, in having with her one she has so long been taught to regard as a sister.' This was spoken with emotion, and in a tone that was tremulous with some deep feeling. `I am sure we feel like sisters,' said Clara, resting her large eyes, as she spoke, full upon the handsome and intelligent countenance of the student, whose own gaze fell confused before their brilliant fire. He had never before known the power of woman's eyes, nor gazed upon a style of beauty like hers! His embarrassment was visible to his sister as well as to Miss Forrest, who smiled, and then added gravely, `and I trust you will acknowledge me as a sister.' This was spoken with slight emphasis. The beautiful girl had seen the impression her beauty had made upon him. She had observed his start of deep emotion when he was first presented to her by her father, an hour before, when they reached the villa from the ship. His manner now confirmed her in the conviction that the retiring student had received an impression that it became her at once to efface. Woman is never blind to the impressions her beauty makes. The effect produced may be slight, impercepticle to others; but she discovers and understands its character as if by instinct. No man ever looked upon a woman with a glance of love, however timid and irresolved, without betraying himself to the object of it. The glance of mere admiration, the look of surprise at beholding unusual beauty, the gaze of idle homage, the marked attention of the refined amateur are never mistaken by her for the expression, hesitating eloquence of the eye, through which the heart steals, and betrays tremblingly its secret. `You will, I trust, acknowledge me as a sister,' therefore said the beautiful girl to him, with just emphasis sufficient for him to understand, if, perchance, he had indulged a thought of love towards one who had no heart to return for his, and who respected him too much to desire to allure him, to conquer and destroy. `As a sister,' he answered in a low tone. His voice trembled. It seemed as if he had much difficulty in articulating even the three words of his reply. He had felt the full force of her reply. It had pierced his soul. He understood her meaning. He felt that the sweet dream of love which had began to evolve from the shadows of his soul was dissipated in sudden darkness and gloom. He had indeed loved the beautiful East-Indian from the moment he beheld her. Yes, the quiet student who had never mixed in the society of females, who had scarcely ever spoken with any save his sister, he had all at once upon a brief interview with a perfect stranger, a child of a foreign clime, surrendered his being to her power. But this love had not its birth then. From early boyhood Clara Forrest had been the subject of his hours of imagination and her image such as his romantic fancy painted it, mingled in his dreams. The correspondence that was constantly kept up between. Colonel Hood and the wealthy Indian merchant had, as we have said, made the children of both intimate though they had never seen each other. In one of Mr. Forrest's letters, written when Clara was nine years old, was a glowing description of her beauty with paternal anticipations of what the future promised. Henry was then a romantic, studious boy of twelve years. This description he read and it took a firm hold upon his imagination. He wrote sonnets and addressed them to her; he loved to imagine her a beautiful lady captive and himself an armed knight rescuing her and making her his bride, Sometimes he would conceive her to be an Indian Princess and he the warrior of her hand by his valor in arms.' As the boy grew to manhood the image of the unknown East Indian beauty was divested of much of its romance with which he had associated it; but his imagination only resigned its office to the heart. Here, in the secret chambers of his being his thoughts dwelt upon the ideal image of her to whom he had there erected an altar. The student loved the unknown being his strange passion had created. Clara Forrest indeed was a real person; but the creation of his love was as ideal as if she had never lived! He knew not that a face of glorious beauty which always came up from the fountain of his soul when he would think of her, was like her. It was as if he loved an imaginary being; and yet in truth he loved one who had existence. This passion was a secret between himself and his own soul. Not even his own sister dreamed that he loved beyond his books. She knew not that, at will, he could call up on every page an image of beauty before which his soul bowed in adoration. Was the image of his imagination like the reality? Did he recognize in the beautiful stranger when he first beheld her, the features and form of the ideal creature before which he had so long worshipped in secret? It was this recognition that had nearly overpowered him when he first beheld her. He was standing at a window watching a party approaching from the beach. He had seen them land and knew they were from the merchantman. The sight of a female among them led both Mary and Colonel Hood to exclaim that it might possibly be Mr. Forrest and his daughter. With this idea they hastened to meet them, at any rate welcome them if they should prove to be strangers. This idea at first caused Henry to move eagerly on a few steps; but the next moment he cheeked himself and with very strong emotion expressed in his features and manner he returned to the window and watched them. `I will see them when they meet!' he said; `if they embrace I shall know it is Clara! Shall I then hasten to meet them also! How shall I address one whom I have only addressed in the voiceless language of the soul! If it is she shall I recognise in her the ideal of my hearts' worship! Heaven grant me this happiness! He beheld the parties' meet, and the next moment embrace. He lingered a moment and then, irresolute, fled to his study to gather resolution. His pulse throbbed wildly. To calm his thoughts he took down Euclid and began to demonstrate one of the most close and difficult problems. This mental discipline was successful. In a little while he rose from his table composed. He heard the voice of his sister in the hall calling his name. He went forth and was met by her; `They have come, brother! This is Clara! Clara this is my brother Henry!' He looked at the maiden. Their eyes met. He beheld before him the reality of his ideal! His soul was in his gaze. The expression startled her and betrayed to her the sweet of his life. Overwhelmed with astonishment and wonder he felt if he lingered he should fall before her and worship as he had done upon the altar of his heart. With a strong intellectual effort he mastered his emotions, and took the hand she had extended towards him. He said a few words of welcome. But he seemed to himself to be dreaming. He felt bewildered with a strange joy. He was oppressed with deep amazement.— His soul was melted with sweet gratitud. Mr. Forrest and Freemantle being then presented he had time to recover his self-possession; and being drawn by the latter to the piazza where the three vessels could be seen moving on their courses, he was soon engaged in conversation and time was given him to control the emotion which the extraordinary events just transpired had awakened. The emotion of the student as he replied to Miss Forrest was not unobserved by Freemantle. He made no remark nor seemed to notice it. It was plam to him that his quiet friend was deeply moved by the power of the beauty which had made him captive. He saw too by her impressive reply, that Clara had discovered his awakening passion and was warning him to subdue it. The parties remained some minutes together in conversation, and then Henry excused himself to Freemantle, left the parlor and hastened to his study. In a moment or two his sister followed him leaving the young Privateersman and the fair East Indian alone. Freemantle met her eyes with a smile of joy and then going to the open window to see that the two old gentlemen were at the farther end of the piazza, he returned to her and folded her to his heart. `My wife! My sweet wife!' `Noble Norman! Dearest husband!' `This meeting is indeed as unhoped for as it is most happy,' he said as he again and again pressed her to his heart with the most tender demonstration of affection. `God be thanked, Norman, that we meet once more and under such circumstances! What a sad, sad parting was our last!' `Do not think of the past, dearest Clara! The present is ours!— The past should never cast its shadow across it!' `I speak of it only to be more grateful for the present happiness. `We shall part no more!' said the young husband!' `But my father?' `He shall know all!' `Hark! a foot-step approaches! Let the length of the room separate us!' `Ah, Captain Freemantle, you are here, hey?' said Colonel Hood! Bravery and beauty should always be in each other's company. Come, sir, Mr Forrest and I are going in to take a glass of wine, and I have sought you to join us!' `I will look at Mary's flowers the meanwhile,' said the lovely East Indian turning as if to examine some plants, but to conceal the blushing joy that she feared would too plainly betray her happiness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. THE AFRICAN. Captain Freemantle accompanied his host along the gallery to its extremity and entered with him through one of those long Venetian windows which serve as doors, into a small apartment, curiously furnished with swords crossed upon the wall; chapaux and plumes hanging above them; military coats and buff waistcoats garnishing one side of the mantle-piece, and maps of fortifications with a spy-glass or two, suspended upon the other. Battle-pieces also adorned the room, and in one corner was a small book-case, filled with works on military tactics. One window looked upon the woods and lawns to the north of the villa, and the other commanded a bold prospect of the bay, upon the waters of which the scenes described in the novel preceding this, were enacted. There was in the room a side-board ancient and nearly black with age, on which stood decanters sparkling with wines. Near the side-board, with his elbow leaning upon it, stood, as they entered, Mr. Forrest gazing upon a fine painting, representing a battle field. `This is what I call my marquee, Captain Freemantle,' said Colonel Hood, as he ushered his guest into the room. `You see it looks quite war-like! I suppose your cabin has something of the same air, only more nautical! A fine picture, my dear Forrest,' continued the Colonel observing how his friend was engaged. `It was painted for me by a very deserving young artist who was in the battle.' `What battle does it represent?' asked Freemantle. `Plattsburg.' `Where you lost your arm?' remarked Mr. Forrest, turning round and regarding his friend with a look of mingled sorrow and pride. `Yes, I left part of myself there, but many a brave fellow left his whole body upon the field.' `I beard of the battle in India. Captain Freemantle, I am glad you have re-joined us,' he said, taking the hand of the young privateersman and pressing it warmly. `I have not yet been able to begin to express to you my deep thankfulness for your gallant services to me and mine.' `Do not express them, my dear sir, and you will most gratify me! I do not relish thanks! I have but done my duty.' `You are a noble young fellow, Captain,' cried Colonel Hood with animation. `I like your spirit. No truly generous man wishes to be thanked. To wish for or to expect and wait for gratitude is a mean sentiment. A man who accuses me of being ungrateful because I am not always thanking him for a service he has done me, is destitute of true nobility of soul. He expects that the one he has benefited must always be the slave to his vanity. But this is moralizing, and we don't allow that in the army, and I am sure they won't in the navy. So gentlemen let us take seats by the table before the open window. Here is black Juba who will serve us with wine, and let us take a bumper to our meeting, and discuss the times as we quaff the grape! Juba,' called the Colonel as the gentlemen seated themselves at the table. `Massa!' answered a tall gentlemanly looking black who entered the room at the call. He was dressed in a sort of military livery of green cloth laced with silver, and his wooley locks profusely powdered. By some process, inconceivable, he had prolonged his hair behind and shaped it into a quene or pig-tail, that stuck out as stiff and strait as the Colonel's. And what was a singular concidence, he had but one arm like his master. In his air and general bearing, he was his ludicrous imitator. `Get glasses, and set on both Madeira and Port.' `Yes, massa,' answered the black with a polite military bow. `Why how happens it, my dear Colonel, that your man has lost an arm,' said Mr. Forrest. `He looks for all the world like your full-length done in lamp-black.' `Why the truth is, Juba is myself in his own opinion,' said the Colonel laughing and glancing at his servant, who with a grave aspect and with great ceremony placed the wine upon the green cloth between them. `How came he to lose an arm also? Not in battle surely?' asked Mr. Forrest. `Not exactly in the battle. You must know that Juba is very closely attached to me! Is it not so, Juba?' `Yes, massa! But please, massa, if you please Juba go out if massa colonel talk about Juba!' `See the honest fellow's modesty!' said the colonel. `Go, Juba, and wait outside till I call you!' `Massa Colonel werry kind,' answered the negro; and bowing with a military stiffness to each person present, he quitted the room. `There goes a fellow, black as his skin is, who has a heart of pure gold!' said the colonel. `I will tell you how he happens to be without an arm! But first let us fill our glasses round and drink to our country, and the success of its arms.' This toast being duly drank in the usual form, Colonel Hood turned to Mr. Forrest; and said, `You have not forgotten the black boy who used to live in Governor Hancock's family!' `No I have reason to remember him,' answered Mr. Forrest. `He saved me from drowning when my boat was upset by a squall in the Back-cove, by springing in after me!' `That boy and Juba are the same!' `But his name was not Juba!' `No. It was Sam; he has only had the name of Juba since he has been in the army. It was given him by the soldiers! He has been in my employ for the past eighteen years. He has no equal. If I were a sculptor, and were called upon to model a statue to represent Fidelity I would make Juba sit for it. He loves me better than he ever did his own father and mother! The rogne loves me better than he loves himself, as I will show you! When I lost my arm you would have thought the poor fellow would have died of grief. His love grew seven inches longer; his eyes sunk deep into his head and his bones wore through his clothes which hung on him as they would have hung upon a skeleton. He watched by me with the tenderness of a mother over a child! He would sigh heavily, till I thought the poor fellow would die of grief. He was constantly lamenting, that while he had two good arms I should have but one. One afternoon as I lay thinking about the poor fellow, and deliberating with myself what I should do with him to keep him from pining away from pure sympathy for me, he entered the room. I had not seen him for five hours, and was really beginning to feel alarmed lest his melancholy should have driven him to suicide, when he entered, as I have said, such a change you never beheld! His face was covered with smiles—absolutely shown with grins. He seemed ready to laugh with some secret sense of happiness. His countenance struck me, nevertheless, as being unusually pale (for negroes can look pale, gentlemen!) and his step less firm—tottering as it were! At first I thought he was tipsy; but as I never knew him to take too much unless I had been taking too much myself, in which case he was sure to get tipsy, I looked closely to see what could be the cause of this extravagant joy. As I did so my eyes rested with horror and astonishment upon the naked and empty sleeve of his left arm!' `Juba, what in Heaven's name have you done?' I cried scarcely believing my eyes. `Hab my arm cut off, massa,' answered the faithful foolish fellow with an air of the most perfect self-satisfaction. `Had your arm cut off?' I exclaimed. `Yes, massa! Juba nebber lib and hab two arms when Massa hab only one! now Juba like massa once more and Juba happy.' On questioning the noble fellow I got from him that he had first broken his arm above the elbow by placing it in a crevice and wrenching it; and then went with it dangling to a surgeon who amputated it. I saw the surgeon afterwards who said the fracture was a confoundedly ugly one, and Juba bore the amputation without a word or a flinch!— The poor fellow had to take his bed, however, with all his courage as it was a month before he got to his feet again! `Juba!' `Massa!' `You've been listening, you rascal or you would'nt, have popped in here so quickly,' said the Colonel laughing and speaking in the kindliest manner while tears glistened in his eyes. `Nebber hear one word, massa!' `Juba here is your health!' said Colonel Hood with an air of respect. `Mr. Forrest and Captain Freemantle I know will join me!' `I shall drink to Juba most readily,' said the young privateersman regarding the negro with interest. `And I shall not refuse, be assured,' answered Mr. Forrest. `Juba you do not recollect me?' `Yes, I does, massa Forrest!' `You do, hey! Then you know I owe you a debt! Here is a diamond ring, wear it for my sake.' `No, Massa! God pay Juba, such debt as you owe him. He no want no pay in dis world.' `You see Juba is a good Christian,' said the Colonel; we might all, perhaps, take lessons from him in faith! But Juba here is your health! God bless you, and in Heaven may he give you wings of gold in place of the arm you have sacrificed here for your love of me!' Never was `a health' drank more sincerely than Juba's. He placed his hand upon his breast and bowed with grateful acknowledgement. For the moment each gentleman, as he gazed upon the black man felt a sentiment of involuntary respect for him. `Now, Captain Freemantle,' said Colonel Hood as he set down his empty glass, `will you be so kind as to promise to remain a week with me! as to your departure in the morning I shant listen to it! I mean to keep my recovered friend Forrest as long as he lives. I will invite the neighboring gentleman and some few friends from the city to a dinner party. I want them to see you and thank you, too, for the service you have done the whole country. Many too will join a ball and you will be a lion amongst the belies! Miss Forrest too has attractions enough to keep half a dozen gallant fellows like you chained to her car for a month. No, no! you can't leave us!' `I have duties, colonel that render my return to Boston on the morrow imperative!' answered Freemantle, who presrved the expression of his countenance with admirable self-possession as he alluded to his lovely wife. I will, however, soon return to share your hospitality.' `I shall hold you to that promise.' `I will redeem it.' `Captain Freemantle,' said Mr. Forrest whose eyes had for some seconds been resting on the face of the young privateersman, `I have been struck with the resemblance of your features to those of a young Indian Prince I saw in the East.' In spite of the commanding self-possession of the young man, the quick blood leaped to his brow at these words. He bent his face over his wine for a moment and then replied, calmly, `I am happy to remind you of any of your friends, sir! We will drink to his health!' This was spoken with admirable firmness. The toast was drank and after a little farther conversation they retired to smoke their cigars upon the verandah.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. THE ENGLISHMAN. Leaving the party in the verandah to enjoy their cigars, we will now follow the individual whom we have choson as the principal personage of this sequel; we mean Herbert Vincent the young Privateersman's mate. It will be remembered that he was left on board the Indiaman on his way into port to attach himself to the Privateer as soon as she arrived.— He had suffered himself to be left behind by Freemantle with manifest reluctance; but as he hoped by complying with his request to keep on in the merchantman he might effect a plan of his own he had conceived, he yielded and suffered the party to proceed to the villa alone. The motive which influenced him to comply must have been a very powerful one; for he was naturally of an imperious temper and little relished submission. But by submission now, however, he felt could he alone render himself powerful hereafter. He was of a jealous temper also; and the address and courage and fine face of Freemantle rendered him uneasy lest an impression unfavorable, by contrast, to himself, should be made by him upon the mind of Mary Hood. For these reasons he would rather have accompanied him; but a deeper motive led him to proceed on his way in the ship. The Indiaman reached the harbor the next morning and dropped anchor off India wharf, then the principal pier of the port. As Vincent had nothing to do with this vessel he landed immediately in a shortboat. As he stepped upon the wharf he looked anxiously seaward in hopes that he should descry the privateer standing in. She was not yet in sight. To enable him to obtain a wider view of the harbor outside he ascended Fort Hill which towered close at hand. It was not then so closely surrounded by edifices as at the present day, and the scope of the view seaward was uninterrupted. There was a man dressed as a seaman also upon the hill standing near the flag-staff with a glass at his eye and scanning the offing. Vincent directed his eyes upon him a moment, and then advanced towards him, laid his hand upon his arm, ere the man who was looking through the glass with one eye shut was aware of his presence. `Davieson!' `What! Mr. Vincent!' exclaimed the stranger with a look of recognition. `Yes, Davieson. What do you here?' `I am watching a suspicious craft in the offing,' said the seaman, who was a bluff, strong-built man about forty years old, with a face sea-browned and rough from exposure to storm and sun. `Is this all you have to do? Where is your ship?' `I left her,' answered the man doggedly. `For what?' `I dont choose to tell!' `You are in ill-humor, Davieson! Come let us go into the tavern under the pitch of the hill here, and take a glass for old ship-mates' sake!' `Well that is something like! I never refuses a good offer, Mr. Vincent! You are a gentleman, if you are no longer an officer!' `I will first borow your glass!' said Vincent coloring; `What were you looking for?' `A privateer I want to ship in! She slipped and went from her moorings below the castle there yesterday all of a sudden; and I and four other boys as was in a boat pulling down to her were left to pull back. But as she only slipped her cable, she'll be likely to be in again soon! We heard firing to windward south away, and perhaps she went out to see what was going on!' `She prevented an English Corvette from capturing that Indiaman that just came to anchor! She kept the Englishman off at long shot, and even disabled him; while the merchantman kept safe to port!' `That is what I call doing the haudsome thing!' `How is it you have quit the service, Boatswain?' `Why you see, I dont like to take every thing. A middy was saucy and I struck him. So to save trouble and expense to the service I gave it a wide berth, and just now I am adrift. I lodge down in the tavern there, but as I'm hove short for cash, I and four other good men resolved as I told you to try Freemantle we've heard so much off. As soon as he gets back to port, I mean to ship with him! They say every man that sails with him gets rich!' `Who are these men with you?' `Two of them left the frigate with me, and they were both fore-topmen. Ned and Jack Breeze!' `I remember them. They are daring fellows!' `Yes. They don't fear much of anything. The other is a long shore craft we picked up. His name is Lot Lunt, a fresh water sailor, but he knows enough by natur' and is as brave as a lion! He says he's been a schoolmaster, but how that is I don't know. I only know he can drink grog like a purser's pig!' Vincent appeared not to give his words attention; but he was listening with the keenest interest, though his spy-glass was all the while at his eye. Not a word escaped him, and his active mind was busily revolving his description of these men, and deepening some plan he had previously conceived. `The privateer is in sight,' he suddenly cried. She is standing in on a bowline! She has been concealed by the shoulder of the outer island.' `Then I'm aboard of her afore her anchor fairly touches the mud! If Freemantle wants five good men we'll tell him he needn't go far for them! We shall have hard knocks sailing with him, but hard dollars, too! There I see her with my naked eye. What a mainsail she sets. It looks like a boy with his grandfather's coat on! It covers her all over! What a topsail! It is square as a sloop's! Not one breadth of canvass less in it, I'll make oath, than in our mizzen-top-sail! Well, let her come! The sooner the better! They say the war will soon end and then there'll be an end to prizes! Freemantle must strike fast and while he can; or his commissions will run out! I'll take the glass down, Mr. Vincent. It belongs to the Commodore as keeps the Fore-Top-Tavern there! He's mighty pertikkelar about it, and only lends it to pertikkelar friends!' Thus speaking, the seaman who had been boatswain's mate on board the frigate in which Vincent had sailed, received the spy-glass from his former officer and together they descended the steep path that led to the tavern on the lower street. It was about dusk on the evening of the day in which this interview took place between Vincent and Davidson, that the former landed from a six oared barge in a retired spot at the foot of an obscure street, and landing alone took his way rapidly up the street. He traversed it to its extremity and then turning to the left came near a long brick wall, enclosing a huge stone edifice which had once been used as a distillery, but was now appropriated to the safe custody of such prisoners of war as had been brought into port in captured vessels of the enemy. The number of prisoners confined here was now about three hundred. Among them was a captain and his crew who had been taken by an American brig of war under circumstances that led to the belief that although he was cruising under English colors, he was a freebooter; one of those lawless men who take advantage of wars and prey alike indiscriminately upon the defenceless of both parties. While the rest of the prisoners were detained waiting for exchange, or release by the termination of the war, which was daily expected to be brought to a close, this man and about thirty-five men with him was held in durance awaiting his trial for piracy, so soon as intelligence could be obtained from England denying his claim to English protection. There was a heavy wooden gate in the wall of this prison enclosure, and within the gate a small tenement not unlike a watchman's stall but larger in which the porter stood watch; while suitable sentries did guard duty day and night. Coming to this gate, Vincent tapped lightly against a small wicket which opened upon a level with his face. `Smith!' he said in a low tone as the wicket opened. `Well,' demanded a gruff voice within, in a strong Yankee twang. `I am Vincent!' answered the young man in an under tone. `Softly! Don't speak loud!' said Smith. `Have you the money you promised me to day to bring with you?' `Yes!' `The cool hundred?' `Yes. Here is fifty in this purse! You shall have fifty more when you let me out!' `Good! wait till I count it! It is a great risk I'm running! But a hundred dollars ain't got by whistling for it! Wait till I count it!' `Confound the cautious fellow,' muttered Vincent as the man closed the wicket upon him. `If he deceives me now and keeps the money! But I know him too well! His avarice must have the remaining fifty!' `All right, Mr. Vincent! Now you must not do any thing to bring the devil on me! As I open the gate steal in like a shadow! The prisoners are all in the big room, shut up for the night!' he said as Vincent entered through the cautious opening. `Take this old jacket and old hat and pass yourself off as one of them. In this way you can speak with who you please!' `Where shall I find the Englishman, Keith?' `It ain't him you want to see?' `It is he, and no other!' `It can't be. He is locked up in his room. They keep him close at night I tell you! You know they 'spect he's a bloody pirate.' `I must see him! You must bring me to conversation with him!' said Herbert peremptorily. `It is a hard matter. I've risked my neck now! But a hundred dollars is worth its weight in New England. If they know'd what I was doin' I'd be shot dead as a hammer! Won't it do to see some of the rest on 'em? I can let you into the big room where they are playin' cards, and drinkin', and boxin' and makin' noise enough to scare a wood full o' bears! Don't you hear 'em?' `I must see Keith!' `You must!' `Yes!' `Don't I touch the other fifty?' `Not unless I see the Englishman.' `Wall, fifty dollars ain't to be got by honest means in these here wartimes! So I'll see what I can do! There's a sojer there by that door who keeps guard. Now he drinks like a fish when he can get it for nothing! Now if you can stand a treat and give me the money to send out a black nigger as goes the errands here for some ardent, I think we might get the soger to try it! Get him blue and then you can go and see this Pirate for yourself, and as long as you want to if you don't stay till the relief comes round at twelve o'clock!' Vincent drew from his pocket a flask and placed it in the hand of Job Smith. `I brought two of these with me to drink with the Englishman. He can do with one. Now call your friend with the musket this way.' `I'll have him here without coaxing when he sees this! Come here, squire with the gun! Here's a prisoner and me what are going to spree it on a small scale! Suppose you help us, coz three al'ays makes even number. The sentinel advanced with alacrity. `What! Brandy hey?' said the soldier after he had smelt of it!— `This is a treat!' `It's a present from my aunt Keziah-Ann. Let us drink her health the first thing!' The liquor was potent. The soldier was willing. His brains were few. His draughts were many; and in twenty minutes Herbert had his way clear to the apartment in which the prisoner he had come to visit, was confined.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. THE PROPOSAL. The room in which the Englishman was confined had, been under the former uses of the building a store-house. It was closed by a strong door across, on which were placed two iron bars instead of locks. When the prisoners were to be let out to walk in the yard the bars were merely removed, and the door swung open; when they were shut in again the bars were simply replaced and the safety of the prisoners as well secured as if locks had been upon the door. The way having been opened to Vincent by the intoxication of the sentry, there was no obstacle to prevent him from having free access to the individual whom he came to visit. He gained the door uninterrupted, and softly removing the iron bars from their sockets, he entered the apartment. A solitary tallow candle burning in the neck of a bottle and placed upon the head of a barrel, gave an obscure view of the interior of the gloomy place. Around the room crouched upon the floor and wrapped in blankets he discovered through the obscurity the dim outlines of numerous human forms; some lying in the deep repose of sleep, others with the headlifted or half-raised upon the elbow gazing upon the intruder. On one side, gathered around an old door placed upon two casks were grouped four or five savage, half-naked men, playing at cards by the faint light shed by the candle. On seeing him enter they arrested their game, and with their cards held in their hands and their lowering eyes turned upon him, regarded him with curiosity and suspicion. One or two of the prisoners with arms folded upon the chest, were pacing up and down the apartment, and against a brick pillar which supported the roof leaned another, smoking a cigar. There were about thirty men in the room, and most of them wearing the garb of seamen. They seemed to be of all nations, though the English physiognomy predominated upon their hard, and crime engraved visages. Hebert looked around him for a moment as if in search of some one, and was then advancing towards the man who leaned against the pillar, when he heard Smith's voice behind him: `I must bar the door, capting, or the pirates will make a rush.— When you want to come out just knock and I'll hear you!' Herbert made no reply; though he would rather not have been fastened in with such a desperate set of men as he knew were around him.— He was, however, as brave as he was destitute of principle. Advancing towards the man who fixed his eyes keenly upon him, as he approached, he said, `I would see you, captain?' `Are you one of the new jailers on guard?' asked the man, sullenly. `No. I am merely a visiter. I have business with your commander.' `He is in his room,' answered the man with an inclination of his head to the opposite side of the apartment. `What is it! Who is he, Brent?' called a deep voice from that quarter. `A strange sail wants to speak you, captain!' answered the man, who was a good specimen of an English sailor in his appearance, save that his countenance wore an expression of villany, very strongly contrasting the frank, ingenuous air of the honest tar. `Let him come here?' responded the voice. `That is the captain. Bear away for him!' said the man. `Vincent crossed the room and came in front of a door, which had out in the upper part of it a small window. This door was both locked and barred, and a chain was passed across it for additional security.— It led into an arched brick vault which perverted from its original use, now served as a place of close confinement by night for the English captain. `What would you say to me?' he demanded, as Herbert came close up before the door. Vincent could only faintly see the shoulders and features of a large man, who was gazing upon him from the small window. The face seemed bold and manly, as the voice had been which fell upon his ear. `Are you Captain Keith?' `Yes,' was the abrupt answer. `Do you not know me? They kennel me at night like a dog, lest I should break away! What news bring you? Have they heard yet from England, that I sailed under colors that dont belong to me?' `I have heard nothing!' `Who are you?' `Come nigher! I cant see your face! Ho, lads there bring the candle one of you! Let us look at this craft's signals!' `Let the light remain where it is, captain. I will tell you who I am. Do you remember Kingston, and the last day of carnival there?' The Englishman started, and a deep oath of surprise escaped his lips. He thrust his shaggy head as far from the wicket as he could to scrutinize his features. `You then know me, if no one else does! Who are you?' `As I said before, a friend.' `Bring the light. A traitor among us.' `No. I am Herbert Vincent. I am the midshipman who interposed with my boat's crew to free you from the hands of the authorities. I did not know your character then or why you was pursued so hotly; but afterwards you came to me and swore to serve me for the service I did for you.' The light now shone full on Herbert's face. `It is true! Give me your hand. Stand back boys. He is a friend and brother.' The men who had hastened with the light, and came cursing and growling savage revenge upon the supposed traitor now returned to their game. Herbert, though unprincipled was proud. He did not relish the fraternal term applied to him: but as he intended to make the Englishmen an instrument of his own purposes he made no remark; but giving him his hand through the wicket returned the pressure. `I am here to see you on matters of deep moment to you, Keith. `Let me hear them. But first, how did you know I was here?' I saw you the other day in the prison yard as I passed by the gate, and recognized you at once.' `And you have then for some days been aware what I am, and have not betrayed me to the authorities.' `Yes.' `Then I can trust you. You probably are the only man in America that knows me to be a buccaneer. And I have been of late making my plans so that before the authorities can get the information from England to convict me, I shall be free.' `Have you friends?' `No, only my lads here. We have been secretly at work and in three days more we shall be ready to slip cable and be off.' `What place of security have you outside of the prison?' `We must trust to fortune after we once get free. I did think if we could reach the harbor, of capturing bodily some coasting craft, hoisting sail and running out of the harbor.' `This would be difficult. It would have to be at night and the wind would have to favor you; and you would after all probably run upon one of the islands! I have come here to propose to you a course safer and more profitable to you.' `Let me hear it? My plan of escape will be sure. You see where that blanket covers the floor. Under it loose boards lay over a cavity the men have dug into the earth. They have already executed an underground passage beneath the walls and are within six feet of the surface ten feet beyound the outer-wall. As soon as it is opened all we have to do is to pass through like going down into the main hatch and coming out of the fore.' `You could not well have accompanied them, being in close confinement here.' `It would take but a few minutes for them to get me out. Thirty men would make quick work with my doors and bars. But let me hear what you have to propose.' `It is not to your men, but to you, Captain Keith,' said Vincent in a low voice. I am no longer in the navy, having left it in some ill-favor with my commanding officers. I have to day been chosen the mate of the fastest privateer that sails the sea.' `Who is her commander?' `The famous Freemantle.' `I have seen him and his craft once too much. He chased me on the coast of Africa, where I had just loaded with slaves, overhauled me, boarded me, and compelled me to land them every one again. He was two men to my one, and I was crowded with negroes. I could neither work my vessel nor fight her. I have an account with him I would like to adjust.' `You shall then have your opportunity. I did not look for so trusty a foe of Freemantle in you.' `Then you are his enemy.' `I have nothing particularly against him, but still I hate him as I do the devil. He has appointed me his first officer. I have to day been aboard of the craft and taken command. She now lies at anchor off the north pier. Freemantle himself has not yet returned from a villa a few leagues down the bay where she left him yesterday. He will be on board to-morrow, and we shall sail shortly on a cruise, unless we get news of the ratification of peace. In this case my vocation is gone.' `What would you with me?' `I will tell you. On board the schooner are many men who have no inclination to return to pacific pursuits when the war ends. They have become familiar with a life that is in a manner lawless. They could be easily won over to keep in the privateer and cruise under a private flag. You understand me. `I think I do. But how does this concern me?' `Knowing you were in prison, it occurred to me that by your aid the schooner could be taken and this object secured. My proposition is that you ship on board of her, and appear as a stranger to me. You will then as a hand before the mast talk with the men and sound them all. You will report to me your success and then we will choose an opportunity for taking the vessel out of Freemantle's hand. If you would consent to this, I had determined to effect your release.' `I consent to it, on condition of having the second command.' `This I mean to give you.' `But my thirty men here?' `You must leave them behind! You must make a crew out of that of the privateer! I want you alone! The men must take their chance here.' `Well, I will agree to co-operate with you! How shall I escape?' `To-morrow when you are in the yard, the Porter will invite you to his lodge, and provide you with a disguise. At twelve to-morrow noon you will find me at the Seaman's Inn, under Fort Hill.' `I will be there if I get off in safety.' Vincent then took his leave of him and shortly after passed out of the street gate and took his way to his boat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. THE DEPARTURE. We now return to the villa. The hour had arrived when Freemantle was to take his departure for town. A horse had been offered him by Colonel Hood and Henry proposed to accompany him a few miles across the country till they should enter the turnpike. The leave taking between the young privateersman and his hospitable host was frank and cordial, and on the part of Mr. Forrest marked by strong expressions of gratitude for the services that had been rendered to him and his daughter. `You will certainly be back in two days, my brave friend said Colonel Hood warmly. `Yes to remain for a day or two only.' `In hurry to get to sea again hey? well you will have to be active for there is no doubt but that within a week we shall have intelligence of peace being ratified.' `I hope we shall see you again, before you go to sea, Captain Freemantle,' said Mary speaking with a slightly embarrassed air. `I cannot resist so many inducements as are held out to me return, Miss Hood,' he said with an air at once frank and friendly. `But you are not going without taking leave of Miss Forrest,' said Colonel Hood as the young man passed out from the room upon the piazza in front of which a groom was in waiting with the two saddle horses. `She is in the library,' said Mary readily. `If you will follow me, Captain Freemantle I will conduct you to her.' These words were suggested by the secret art of woman—an amiable woman who loves to promote the happiness of others. Mary had discovered with the penetration of her sex that between the two there was a sympathy of feeling which instinct taught her was love. She knew that they would like to meet alone as he was about to depart, and therefore she had previously told Clara in an arch way, to remain in the library and she would bring the young seaman there, `for,' she added smiling, `I know you would like to see him for a moment without prying eyes upon you.' Freemantle half guessed Mary's motive from something in her looks and tone as she spoke, and returning her a grateful glance he followed her to the library. `You need not come, father,' she said as the Colonel was accompanying him. `I wont run away with him and I will see that Clara does not.' The fair East Indian was standing in the room near the window in an attitude eager and expecting. `Clara, dear, Captain Freemantle has come to say good bye,' said Mary; and then passing into the room she crossed it and returning Clara's look of thank with a smile she passed out of the farther door. `Once more we are alone my dearest life,' said the young privateersman clasping her to his heart. `Do you leave at once, Norman? why so soon?' `I must be in town to night. My schooner is already there, and I have much to do, for I must proceed to sea again in a few days.' `Are we then to be separated again?' `No I shall have my sweet bride with me.' `You do not mean to ask me to leave my father and go with you to sea?' `No, dearest Clara! As soon as I make arrangements for sailing, I intend to return here and see your father and explain all to him.' `This will place a barrier between us no time can remove, dear Norman.' No. I have confidence that I can prevail with him to recognize our union.' `I fear the worst.' `I am sure that all will be sunshine yet! within two or three days you will see me.' `But if news of peace comes?' `Then I shall dispose of my vessel and with my wealth and you, as my bride, go to England. The time is near at hand when I should present myself in the hall of my father.' `You will return within two days?' `Yes, whatever be the issue of this rumor of coming peace. I shall be able to see you oftener and alone.' `I cling to you Norman, almost with a feeling of despair! To recover you again only to part with you the next moment.' `When I see you again, dearest Clara, it shall be to part no more.— If your father refuses his sanction—' `Then my heart will fly where it best loves.' `And that is —?' `In thine own bosom, my noble husband.' `Faithful and true Clara! But we cannot prolong the interview without exciting suspicion. I hear an approaching foot-step! Farewell, and look for me ere three days elapse. Thank for me the sweet girl who has kindly contrived this interview! can she suspect our relation to each other?' `Oh, no? She only has discovered in some way that we love.' With one more hurried embrace the young husband left his beautiful bride and hastened to rejoin the gentleman upon the gallery. In a moment afterwards he was galloping with Harry by his side along the avenue in the direction of the main road. Clara stood at the window watching his departure with tears sparkling in her eyes and her bosom heaving with emotion. A light hand was laid upon hers and an arm of affection gently passed around her waist. She turned and beheld the lovely eyes of Mary Hood softly looking up into her own. The expression of sympathy in them she could not mistake. She hastily brushed the tears from her cheek and smiled. `Don't try dear Clara to disguise your feelings. Relieve your heart by tears! I know all. I did not mean to loiter, but I heard as I closed the door his voice and the endearing term he applied to you.' `What term, dear cousin said Eliza deeply blushing, her voice trembling with alarm. `That of `wife!' But do not look so full of fear! I am true of heart! I will not betray your secret!' `I know you will not, dearest girl,' responded the youthful bride, `I can confide in you, and I meant to do so when I promised to relate to you how I first met this noble youth! Do not breathe what you have discovered to any ear, I entreat you. My father is ignorant of the step I have taken and his anger would overwhelm me if he should by any means accidentally discover it! I know you will feel differently towards me now that you know I am a wife—but—' `No, I love you as fondly as before. I know too, that you must have good reasons for keeping the secret! Will you let me hear your story, dear Clara, and all about how you happened to meet him and be married to him and then be separated and you to meet again so strangely as you have done to-day on board the ship!' `Yes, you shall know all, dear Clara. Can we be uninterupted?' `Yes, in the grounds! Come with me to the summer house upon the hill in the garden. There we shall be retired and be able to see if any one approaches. You dont know how vastly my curiosity is aroused to be let into this mystery concerning you and this noble young sailor!— And your meeting so singularly! And then for my dear Clara after all to be a wife!' `I will gratify your curiosity, my dear Mary,' said the fair East Indian as she suffered her young friend to conduct her from the room into the garden and so along the shrubbery paths up a winding way to the top of a green mound which rose from the lawn and upon which was a summer-house covered with vines. Upon reaching it they seated themselves upon a rude but commodious settee made of oak which was placed fronting the entrance and from which there was a wide spread prospect. Beneath them were the grounds and highly cultivated gardens encircling the villa, the villa itself with its cupola and verandah, the silvery line of the beach stretching away for a league, the headland at the north, the green islands in the bay, and the illimitable sea blending with the blue sky itself of as deep an azure. Here and there far from the land a white sail was visible, motionless like a rock of shining marble, and near the shore the minute-appearing skiff of the fisherman rocked lightly on the undulating bosom of the bay. The snowy wings of the gulls flashed in the light of the declining sun as they wheeled in wild airy circles above his head, ever and anon darting downward like an arrow to catch the fragments of bait cast by him upon the water. The low roll of the lazy surf upon the smooth beach and its angry dash against the isolated rocks that lay upon it, reached their ears with a soothing and agreeable effect. On either hand in the green meadows the farmer was visible raking his hay, beguiling his toil by whistling shrilly and not unmusically some popular air, and along the narrow lanes between the farms that were visible around the villa, slowly moved homeward the heavy wagon, or field-ward the light one, the loud cry of the youthful driver echoed from the woodlands. A cloud of dust a mile distant marked the course of the evening mail from the city, the sharp crack of the coachman's lash ever reaching their ears amid the stillness of the summery air. The green hill sides inland were dotted with brown cows either grazing or lying down beneath the shade of a tree, or wending their slow way towards a brook to lave their heated bodies in its cool flood. In a meadow below the hill several horses were pastured, who taking fire from the rapid motion of those harnessed to the coach, coursed around their broad enclosure with streaming tails and flying manes proudly mocking the trammelled speed of those they would rival. The sky above was soft and hazy without being obscure. An island like cloud white as a bank of the purest snow lay anchored in the west under the sun, which was an hour high. `Now, dear Clara, let me hear your tale,' said Miss Hood after they had for a few moments gazed on this varied scene, and received its beauty and power into their souls. The fair East Indian then began to relate the romance in the next chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. THE CAPTURE. `The manners and customs of the East must be familiar to you, dearest cousin,' said the beautiful East Indian commencing her narrative of the events which led to the secret union with Freemantle; `and especially the domestic habits from my letters to you, as well as those of my father to yours!' `Yes, I know that all that Eastern world is a land of novelty and mystery. It is to me a world of romance. To think of it kindles my imagination.' `There is, indeed much romance there. The land is very beautiful. It is a land of flowers and birds, of beautiful trees and luxurious fruits, of pleasant skies and gorgeous landscapes. The people, too, are in keeping with their scenery. They ore picturesque in their costumes, simple in their modes of life, and very imaginative. Their language is poetry itself. The warmth of the climate causes them to live altogether out of doors, and their gardens and verendah's answer to the parlor and drawing-rooms, and even sleeping-rooms of your houses here. Thus they ever have the heavens and glorious nature around them, and in such scenes the heart expands and the more graceful attributes of the intellect find exercise. The dwellings are very beautiful. They are elegant and tasteful in a degree you cannot conceive of, comparing them with the houses of this climate. They are open night and day, windows and doors, and the cool wind circulates freely through all parts. They are surrounded by latticed galleries thickly shaded by running plants that emit the most delightful fragrance. In these galleries we eat, sit and even sleep when the nights are hotest. The house my father dwelt in, was a little out of the town and surrounded by the most charming gardens. The grounds sloped gently to the harbor, and we had a view of the sea. I am speaking now of Macao where we dwelt permanently, though my father's place of business was at Canton up the river. If you have ever seen a gilded French gold finches' cage with wings and galleries, you can form some notion of our villa; especially if you imagine the gilded cage placed down in the midst of a bed of flowers, or made the centre of a lilliputian garden. The walls of the interior were covered with the most beautiful paintinsg and the ceilings richly ornamented with frescos in the most exquisite taste. The columns of the verandah was painted a pure sky-blue, and the capitals gilded. The floors were tesselated with marbles, and three fountains in the gardens and courts cooled the air. The branches of the ever-green fruit trees were brilliant with their ever-renewed fruits, and musical with the ceaseless song of birds of the most gorgeous plumage. Slaves in flowing costumes and turbans of white muslin with gold and silver bands intervened among the folds, were every where in waiting to obey the slightest expression of a desire. If the air was oppressive, still they would kneel before you and agitate it with fans made of the feathers of the Bird of Paradise. When you wished to go abroad they stood ready to carry you in gilded palanquins covered with silken canopies. All was luxury, repose and elegant indolence!' `Alll this seems a description of some fabled land! I cannot realize that such scenes are upon this earth! And you have been reared among such! I can't help regarding you as a sort of Oriential Princess! How can you be happy in this region of the north! How strange it must seem to you to be here!' `It is; but I have long been familiar with this land, my father's native clime, from his own lips. And I have had as much curiosity to see it as you have to see India! You will now see from what I have said, dear Mary, something of the mode of life peculiar to the East.— I have been thus particular in my description that you may the better understand what is to follow.' `You know my mother has been dead some years. After her death my father devoted himself to me; but as his business rendered it necessary that he should be much of his time at Canton, I was under the necessity of being left at home. The wife of an English clergyman who had died there became my governess, and so far as affection and a sincere interest in me could go, she supplied my mother's place, who was, you are aware, also an Englishwoman!' `But why did not your father take you to Canton with him?' `The Chinese you know, Mary, from some queer prejudice, forbid by law any foreign female entering their dominions!' `I recollect it now!' `And it was in compliance with this regulation that my father kept me at Macao, the place where the families of all the Canton merchants reside!' `But would it have been dangerous if your father had taken you to Canton?' `You shall hear by and by,' answered Clara with a significant smile. `Two years ago, nearly; no, it is but a year and a half, my father left home as usual at the beginning of the business season to go up to Canton. I was then in my sixteeth year, and that in India is quite an advanced period of life, I assure you; for I have had young friends marry at fourteen!' `At fourteen!' `Yes. But young ladies at fourteen and fifteen in India have managed somehow to grow as fast in that time as young ladies of a northern clime in twenty years. They are truly as much matured in mind and body as those here nineteen or twenty years of age! The climate of course produces this precocity; though it is odd that the same causes that effect the vegetable kingdom should operate upon human beings. Young gentlemen too, at eighteen and nineteen are tall and manly and bearded like the pard!' `What a strange idea!' `Well, you must know now that I was at the time I speak of quite a young lady! I had already several admirers. Before I was fifteen I had two offers (but this is a secret!) from English officers!' `Can it be possible?' exclaimed the young American girl regarding her beautiful East Indian friend with a sort of awe and curious surprise. `Don't look quite so astonished, my dear child,' said Miss Forest smiling. `You are quite satisfied I hope that I was quite old enough to take care of my own heart!' `Yes, after what you have told me! If you were not a wife you would be quite an old maid by this time,' answered Mary playfully. `I must be one past redemption!' `Your beauty must ensnare some one if it has not already, Mary.' The maiden blushed, and to conceal her embarrassment, said quickly, `Proceed with your story, Clara. It has in its beginning all the charm, to me, of a romance.' `The morning but one after my father had left for Canton, I was seated upon a shady terrace in the garden, when my attention was directed to one of these Hindostanee proas, which occasionally came to Macao; a vessel of a very picturesque description, with sails like wings, and a very high stern, and a prow carved and gilded and adorned with gay flags. She entered the harbor and taking in her sails anchored not far from the beach at the foot of the gardens. I could see then that she was an armed vessel and that there were a great many men on board of her. My curiosity, in absence of other objects, led me closely to observe what transpired on board. I could discover, by'the spy-glass which I sent for, that there were European faces among the dark faces on her deck; and that in the forward part of the boat there were a great number of the Hindostance people secured as prisoners. In a little while after the vessel came to anchor, a boat put off from her containing an officer and rowed partly by Lascars and partly by Europeans. The boat pulled for the pier and was soon lost to me among the other boats that thronged it. `In about a quarter of an hour afterwards, I saw several barges quit the pier containing soldiers. They went on board the proa, and then I beheld at least sixty of the Hindostanee's, that I saw bound forward, driven into the boats and taken to the pier. In a little while the vessel was cleared of all save the young officer I had seen first go on shore and about twenty seamen! While I was wondering at all I had discovered, my Indian maid came to me and seemed full of news. `What have you heard?' I asked. `Do you see that proa, Missis! It was that of the Hindostanee Pirate Lef!' `Is he taken?' I asked with surprise. `Yes, Misses! Jebel was down at the pier and heard it all!' `Who was this pirate Lef?' asked Mary Hood with deep earnestness. `A noted sea-robber who had a long while infested the waters of the East, and who commanded a fleet of a score of armed proas. Several vessels or war had been from time to time sent after him; but he escaped by running up the rivers where they could not follow him. Vessels of his fleet had been destroyed frequently, but he had hitherto escaped to refit his squadron and once more defy the cruisers sent against him. He was a man of large stature and a terrible countenance, and possessed wonderful power over the wills of his people. The governor-general of India had offered a reward of ten thousand pounds for his head.' `You must have been pleased to have known that he was taken, and also all the people at Macao!' `Yes. The intelligence roused my curiosity, and I felt desirous of seeing the formidable prisoner; and that I might learn all the particulars, I despatched a slave to the port to an elderly gentleman, an intimate friend of my father, connected with the government, to ask him to get the facts and let me hear them when he called in the afternoon; for his daily practice was to drink sherbet and smoke a hookah at our house when my father was at home, and at my request he kept up his custom during his absence; for from him I always got all the news going, while at the same time he acted, in some sort, as my adviser and protector. `The slave had not been gone long ere he returned with my kind, good natured friend, whom he met hastening to give me the first intelligence of the capture of the proa! From him I learned that the proa had been captured by a young American Privateersman—' `Freemantle?' asked Mary quickly. `You shall learn soon, dear couzin! He said that the American had fallen in with the proa commanded by Lef, and six others. That the pirate's whole force had attacked him, but the American sunk three of his vessels and disabled two others; and then laid along side of another proa for the purpose of boarding it. He succeeded in doing so and driving the pirates over the side; but while he was doing this Lef's proa bore down upon the other side of the American schooner and the pirate chief leaped on board, sword in hand followed by half his crew and took possession of her. The American then called his men together to recover his schooner, which he succeeded in doing, driving Lef and his horde back to his own deck. Excited by his success, the young Privateers-man followed it up and boarded the proa. After an obstinate struggle he got possession of it and with his own hand wounded and made Lef prisoner. While this was transacting, the pirates from the other proa had mastered his own vessel and cut it adrift. Thus was he left in possession of the chief proa and with the pirate his prisoner; but with the mortifying sight before him of his own beautiful vessel flying away before the wind in possession of his foes.' `I am all curiosity to know if this young American is Freemantle?' said Mary with interest. `Be patient, sweet couzin, and you shall hear,' responded the beautiful East Indian, with a smile that confirmed the suspicion that had arisen in the mind of the young American maiden.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. THE LOVERS. `The young American' continued Clara Forrest, `finding he could not recover his vessel then, and being not many leaguas from Macaeo resolved to put into port, get rid of his prisoners, and refitting the proa go in pursuit of his lost schooner and try to acchieve her re-capture.— He was gladly aided by the aathorities in getting the proa ready for sea, who immediately sent persons on board to put her in a complete condition!' `But what became of the terrible pirate Lef, and also of the young American,' asked her inquisitive auditor. `When my elderly friend had given me all the information he had obtained upon the subject of the capture, he began to speak to me in high terms of the courage and gallantry shown by the young Captain of the Privateer, whom he represented as a mere youth and very handsome!' `It was Freemantle, I am sure,' said Mary Hood with great emphasis. Miss Forrest made no reply but smiling archly resumed her narration; `When I heard this I told my good friend that he must oblige me with two things; first that I must see the redoubtable Lef; and second I must see his no less redoubtable captor. `As to Lef.' said my friend, `he is now in prison and in chains, and tomorrow will be brought forth for trial if his wounds are not too severe. You shall see him this evening, if you will take your palanquin to the prison and be satisfied to see him through the grate!' `How could you wish to gaze upon the horrid creature?' said Mary with an expression and tone of mingled fear and distaste. `I did not see him, Mary; for when I learned he was wounded and in chains, I cared not to. I had hoped to have seen a tall, fiercd commanding looking savage, casting glances of defiance upon all who gazed upon him! But lying wounded and in chains he would have excited my pity rather than my admiration, so I told my good friend I would give up seeing the capture if I could behold the captor. `This I pledge myself you shall do,' said he. `I will with your leave bring him here this very afternoon.' `No, said I, that will not do. You forgot I am not the proper person to entertain a young gentleman! I merely wish to see him by accident as it were!' `Then you see him now by accident as it were,' he said to me with a look of surprise, as his eye turned upon two persons whom, at the same instant, I saw advancing along one of the avenues of the garden leading from the town-side, preceded by one of my slaves. One of them I recognised as an American merchant, the other was a stranger; but my friend's words led me to suspect who it might be. They advanced towards me. I was taken by surprise and I know must have looked very much confused. `Miss Forrest,' said the merchant, `allow me to present to you, Captain Norman who has just brought into the harbor the noted free-footer Lef a captive in his own vessel! I was going with him to the house of the English Consul and on my way I have taken the liberty to present him to one who may call herself his countrywomen!' `I am most happy to see Captain Normon,' I said, but very greatly embarrassed; for from the moment my eyes had met those of the young stranger my regard was returned with a look so full of surprise, admiration and deference that I dared not a second time raise my glance to his face.' `Was it love at first sight, Clara?' asked Miss Hood smiling. `I may as well confess at once. I was interested instantly in him, and experienced from his gaze emotions hitherto entirely new to me. He must have partaken of similar sensations, for he replied in a tone that was slightly tremulous.' `What did he say?' `I have no recollections, I heard only his voice, but was too much embarrassed to heed his words!' `But was it not Freemantle, Clara?' `Yes!' `I thought so! I was sure of it! but why did he call himself Capain Norman?' `Because he knew that there was in port a British Frigate which had once chased him as Freemantle in the British Cannel; and which he had escaped from by shooting away his fore-top-mast. He, therefore, on entering the harbor concealed his true name, assuming only his first one. And to this day he is only spoken off there as Norman, the Privateersman. No one knows him as Freemantle! At that period there were American privateer-schooners cruising in the Indies!' `But did he not fear being taken by the English frigate as it was?' `No. He knew that his services as the captor of Lef would protect him from any such danger. Besides he did not come in in his own vessel and under his own flag. But, nevertheless in going out again, he feared if he should be known to be Freemantle, the frigate might sail after him, while an unknown American by the name of Norman they would suffer to pass unmolested in consideration of his services!' `I understand it now!' `The interview between Norman and myself lasted but five minutes when the merchant departed with him. But if was a five minutes in which was condensed the happiness of a life. I had invited him to return to tea with the merchant and my elderly friend, and he promised to do so. He came. The moments were winged in his presence. We promenaded the verandah leaving the two gentlemen over their sherbet and hookahs. He talked to me of America. He discoursed to me of the sea and his love! He recounted the dangers he had passed through, by storm and battle. We wandered into the gardens. The starry sky was over us, and the pleasant evening breeze was fragrant with the breath of flowers. We loitered on till we forgot there was any other world than that of love. He told me the history of his life! He ended by opening to me that of his heart. How eloqueutly did he discourse of love. Not a word he breathed into my charmed ear that found not an answering chord in my heart, You have seen him, Mary! You have heard him speak!' The young girl sighed as she answered, with trembling accents. `Yes.' `Do not marvel then that I yielded my spirit up a willing captive to his eloquence. Ere we had returned to the verandah, he had declared his deep passion.' `And could you credit, dear Clara the existence of a true-hearted love, formed in such a brief space of time?' `Why should I have doubted when I found in my own heart a passion that echoed his? I believed because I also loved!' `Love is so very strange,' remarked the maiden, with a deep sigh. `It is very strange, Mary, and I dare say you can say it is from your own experience. But I will not cause you to blush, though you look so lovely with a little more rose in your cheeks. I will go on with my own loves. The ensuing morning as I was alone in a room that opened into the garden singing to my lute, but with my thoughts upon the young stranger whose name was on every tongue, he suddenly appeared before me, and apologizing with a smile, for his intrusion, paid me some compliments upon my singing, and asked me to repeat the song for him. I did so. He joined in, with his deep, rich voice, and thus in singing and conversation the hours fled. Thus day after day passed for a week. Each morning—each evening he was in my presence breathing vows of love and devotion. At length the hour came for his departure. He came to take his leave of me. It was then I began truly to feel how dear he had became. We parted in tears and vows of constancy. He promised to return so soon as he could re-capture his schooner, and once more give me his society; but in the interval he said he should visit Canton if possible to get my father to assent to our union!' `And you would have married an unknown stranger, Clara.' `He was not unknown. He had unfolded to me all his life from boyhood! I knew him as if I had known him all my life. He opened to me his heart and I beheld its truth! He unveiled to me the excellencies of his mind and I saw how noble his intellect was! No, Clara, he was far from being a stranger to me! Married him do you ask!— Did I not marry him?' `How, and where?' `You shall hear! He departed. I saw him stand upon the deck of his proa and wave to me his hand in adieu! I answered it, though blinded with tears I could scarcely distinguish him. I followed the receding vessel till its white sails faded into the blue mist of the horizon.' `He had been gone twelve days when intelligence reached me that my father was lying dangerously ill at Canton. My devotion to my father was even superior to that of the new love, which during his absence had been born in my heart. My grief at not being able to be with him to nurse him almost maddened me. If I could have got any captain to have taken me up the river it would have been death to have been discovered there. But no captain would have received me on board. In doing so he would risk the loss of his vessel. You may conceive of my distress, dear Mary! My father lying ill but a day or two's sail distance, and I, his only child, forbidden, by absurd laws, to soothe his sufferings. The next day an English ship came in from the river and not only confirmed the report brought by the first, but brought intelligence that my dear father was much worse; and that the physician at the Hong being also ill he had only the attendance of the native doctors, whose treatment of fevers and all diseases is most barbarous. My anxiety and grief combined with my indignation at the foolish regulations which kept me away from him, nearly overthrew my reason. One event alone saved it from wreck.' `What was this, Clara?' `The return of Norman! On the evening of the third day after I got news of my father's situation he came into the harbor in his own schooner under American colors. There was no English vessels of war in port then and he knew he could enter with impunity.' `And he had re-captured his vessel.' `Yes, after a most severe conflict, and after the performance of deeds of courage that are unparalelled. To relate to you the events of the enterprize as he afterwards detailed them to me, Clara, would `fill a volume' as the novel-writers say. I was first aware of his return by an exclamation of one of the slaves who uttered his name in a loud tone. I was at the moment reclining upon my divan in a state of exhaustion from weeping. I rose with an electric thrill, and beheld him smiling upon me. Regardless of the presence of the slaves I threw myself into his arms! With the sight of him rose instantaneously an idea bright with hope.' `I told him of my father's situation and my deep grief, and my wish to be near him.' `I cannot go, Norman,' I cried, `but you can! Hasten to him!— Watch over him! Be all to him that I would be.' `And he went?' earnestly asked her lovely listener. `You shall hear,' she answered, with an impressive cadence in her voice, `and be prepared to be surprised, my dear cousin, more than at any thing you have yet heard me relate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. THE INDIAN PRINCE. The young American girl bent forward more earnestly than before to listen to the words of the beautiful East Indian. `You can go if you will but give your consent,' continued Clara Forrest, said Norman to me.' `How?' I asked him with surprise. `Clara! He answered, taking my hand and speaking in a tone of passionate earnestness, our hearts are one let our fortunes be one!— Consent to become my wedded wife and to-morrow with you on board my schooner will I set sail for Canton.' `I listened with surprise, but before I could object or utter a word he continued a follows.' `Your father is ill at Canton! You are in despair that you cannot reach him to nurse him! You would send me to him in your stead! I would gladly go, Clara, but you can go also. As my bride I can take you without derision to your fair fame!' `But how shall I be any safer in Canton as your wife,' I asked, `than as I am, should I consent to go with you as I am? How would my danger be lessened?' `My plan is to haye you disguised in male attire and pass as a youth. Under this disguise you can land with me in security. But that you may go with me in this manner first become my bride, so that no stain shall fasten upon your name by and by. You love me! You know I adore you! We can keep the marriage a secret until a suitable opportunity offers to make it known to your father and the world!' `After much persuasion on his part I gave my consent to this step! My love for him would not suffer me to say no, and my desire to see my father hastened and confirmed my decision! So that very night we were privately married by the English chaplain of the Port, who was enjoined to, and promised secrecy until he was called upon to reveal the evidence of the marriage. To no other person was it known save my governess whom I made my confidant and whom I knew I could trust. To her I unfolded all my motives and seeing that my happiness was suspended on seeing my father she yielded, and not only witnessed the ceremony but made all preparations for my instant departure. She was to say that I had gone for a few days on a visit to the interior to prevent exciting any curiosity as to my sudden absence.' `How very strange all this seems to me,' said Mary Hood. `But do not let my wondering exclamations interrupt you. It is natural as you were already loved and betrothed to him that you should consent to marry him under the circumstances you have described. It would not have been proper for you to have gone disguised in male costume with him to seek your father, unless you went under the sacred name of wife!' `Such were my own reasonings Mary. Had the circumstances been different I should not have become his wife, dear as he was to me, without my father's consent. But as I have never yet repented the step I then took I will not make any effort to palliate it. It was the result of peculiar circumstances. Without taking it I should be unable to see my father; but by doing so I had the prospect of being by his bedside within three days!' `The next morning I went on board the schooner with my husband!— `In female costume?' `No,' answered Ellen slightly coloring and dropping her eyes. `I had previously assumed that of a young East Indian Secretary, blue loose trowsers flowing to the feet and a camiset or jacket of green lawn, over which I wore a white linen scarf in the form of a mantle. I cut off my hair, long and beautiful as it was, and wore a red cloth cap with a band of gold lace. I carried at my girdle a box containing my pen paper and ink and in all points I looked like a very smart young clerk.' `Your hair has grown out now! How I should like to have seen you in that costume! I wonder Captain Freemantle should have consented that you should part with your hair if it was as beautiful as it is now!' `He opposed it at first; but finally consented, as he wished me to incur no risks! He, as well as I, knew that detection would be death.' `What danger you were exposing your life to! What courage— what love for your father you must have had! I look upon you, Clara, with a sort of awe and admiration! You don't seem to me to be an ordinary person! You have a spirit above a woman's.' `No; believe me a woman's spirit and a woman's courage; both are more elevated than those of the other sex! The courage of man is aided and supported by a consciousness of physical power: that of woman is solely dependent on its innate vigor and native energy. If man possessed the courage of woman in addition to his physical strength, he would be invincible! What woman lacks in strength of body is to be found in her soul! But this is not my story! `No one on board suspected me to be other than what I seemed—a young Ceylonese secretary. My knowledge of the language aided my part, and as I dyed my face and hands with the juice of a leaf peculiar to that country, my disguise was perfect. As I regarded myself in the glass, there was nothing of my former self I recognized save the expression in my eyes. It seemed to me as if I was gazing upon a strange Ceylon youth of sixteen. `We reached the mouth of the river, and hoisting the Spanish flag to escape the regard of English cruisers, we ascended towards Canton. The winds and tides favored us and the third morning we reached Canton. Norman would not suffer me to go to the American Hong by myself, but being himself well known to some British officers, whom he knew to be on shore, he did not know how to escape recognition unless he disguised himself also. He therefore went in the boat to one of the floating shops, streets of which stretched away upon the bosom of the river on all sides of us, and returned with the rich costume of an Indian Prince, which was the only complete suit that would fit him that he could purchase. He put this on and with a little aid of art he stood before me a complete representation of the character he had assumed. `In the East, there are numerous small governments or clans which are governed by hereditary chiefs, subject however to the English supremacy. These chiefs are styled Princes; and their sons, all of them, are so designated. It is not unusual to see several of these princes on a visit to the English and American trading stations at the same time. The appearance, therefore, of Norman on shore in this costume and character, would not excite such particular attention as you would at first suppose. `We landed together, I acting the character of his secretary and walking a little behind him. I should in a few minutes see my father or be told that he no longer lived! My anxiety was very great. I did not think of the danger I was now in on account of sex. I only thought of my father. I inquired of a sea-captain (using broken English) the direction to my fathers residence, which was over his place of business. I approached it with trembling steps. Norman encouraged me and bade me to hope for the best. He looked anxious but it was for my safety. He knew that if I was suspected of being a female, it would be the signal for an uproar among the Chinese, to whose vengeance I should fall an instant sacrifice. `I tremble for you, dear Clara, even now,' said Miss Hood shuddering. `Upon inquiring of a slave at the entrance, I learned with joy that my father was not only alive, but there were hopes of his recovery. I asked to see him, but was told no one was permitted to do so. A Chinese physician came forth and I was about to ask him for leave to go in, when Norman checked me.' `Do not speak. Your voice may betray you. Let no Chinese hear your voice! Write a line in English and get this slave to take it into him.' `I wrote on a piece of paper these words: `My dear father. I heard of your illness at Macao. I could not remain there while you where perhaps dying among strangers. I am here without your door—protected by an unperceptible disguise. I have come to nurse you. Do not be alarmed for my safety. I am disguised as a Ceylonese clerk. I pray you send for me to come in that I may be with you.' `I signed it with the initials of my name and sent it in to him by the slave. In a few minutes he returned and told me to follow him. Norman said he would accompany me. I passed along the corridor and ascending a flight of stairs at its extremity, I found myself all at once in the presence of my father. He had been lying upon a couch, but was now raised upon his elbow keenly regarding my entrance with his pale and emaciated features flushed by excitement. He had previously sent his attendants from the room; and seeing that he was alone I rushed forward and threw myself upon my knees before him and clasped his head to my heart.' `Clara,' he said in a tone so mournful and so full of reproof as he returned my embrace; `you have done wrong—very wrong! This only is wanting to destroy me! You must instantly leave this dangerous spot. Have you come here that I may behold you torn limb from limb by the infuriated Chinese!' He could scarcely speak for debility struggling with emotion. I explained to him my grief, and how I suffered on hearing of his illness, and from the reflections that I was denied the happiness of being with him. I laid before him all that I had endured and imploring his forgiveness, implored him to suffer me to remain. At length he was softened, and feeling more confidence in the security of my disguise he promised that I should remain until he could be taken on board a ship and conveyed to Macao, which he said would be in two or three days, as he was anxious to get me out of the country. He at the same time made me promise that I would not leave the house nor open my lips in the presence of a Chinese. He then decided that I should remain as a clerk engaged by him to record his will, and that no one should be permitted to have access to me until I should be safely got aboard the ship he intended to embark in, as soon as he could bear the motion of a palanquin to take him to her. `My father, now for the first time beheld Norman who had stood back by the door where he could not be seen by one lying as my father was. Norman advanced just as my father was asking me to explain how I had come to Canton. `Who is this?' he asked with surprise. I hesitated. I did not want to deceive my father! He was not in a situation to hear without excitement, the truth. I hesitated, not knowing how to reply, when Norman said, speaking in English, to which he gave the Indian accent. `I had a proa in Macao, Mandarin! I saw this youth in tears weeping much to get to his father! I took him on board my vessel and to-day we came to Canton!' `Then he is ignorant of your sex?' inquired my father with a look of great relief. `He supposes you are my son. Then half the danger is lessened. You and I are the depositaries of this fatal secret.' I bowed. I could not speak, for I had not the courage to give my tongue to a falsehood. Yet for the present, while my father was so weak, I felt that it was necessary to withold from him all the truth!'</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. THE DISCOVERY. `For two days,' continued the fair East Indian bride, `I remained attending upon my father, and preserving the closest disguise. He improved rapidly after I came to him, and more than once expressed his gratitude for my love and care. Nevertheless he remained deeply solicitous for my safety; and feared each moment when some untoward circumstance should expose me to the rage of the multitude. For myself I experienced no fears. I felt secure in my assumed costume, and the satisfaction of being with my father and witnessing his rapid convalescence rendered me insensible to any of the consequences by which I purchased such sweet happiness. `Where was Norman the meanwhile?' `He had taken lodgings in a house directly opposite my father's and there he watched over my safety, but without betraying his interest in me in such a way as to draw attention. While my father slept in the heat of the day he would come over and converse with me upon the future. I told him that my father had determined as soon as he could be removed to go on board the American ship, `William Grey,' then lying in the river, and proceed to Macao for the purpose of returning me there in safety. Norman proposed to offer his own vessel which still lay below the town under her Spanish colors. To this I objected, and proposed that he should permit me to return to Macao with my father, and that he should follow me in the schooner, and visit me at my father's, and there together we would unfold to him our union, and so explain the motives as easily to obtain his recognition of it. To this step Norman gave his consent; and said he would only remain where he was until he saw me safely on board the American ship, and then weigh anchor and follow us. One morning while we were thus conversing earnestly together, Norman standing in the paved passage of the house, and I leaning out to him over a latticed window that opened from my father's room into the passage, I suddenly heard my father call me by name. I looked round and saw him seated up in his couch and regarding us closely, and with a look of displeasure. I had supposed him asleep, as he did not usually awake till an hour later. At a look from me, Norman retired, while I hastened to my father. `Clara, I like not this intimacy with this young Prince. Why is he here and what do you discourse upon in such low tones? Did I not pay him one hundred dollars for your passage in his vessel? Why does he come here? Are you interested in him? Is he in you? If so he knows you are not what you seem!' `He would inquire after your health, sir,' I answered, not knowing what to say; and I am confident my face betrayed my embarrassment For a moment I was deliberating about confessing all to him; when to my surprise he rose up and stood upon his feet. `I am well, you see, Clara! Your increasing dangers have inspired me with health. This very hour you must prepare to go on board with me! I can bear the fatigue. I am satisfied that young Prince is aware of your sex. The expression of his eyes as he looked upon you was not such as men regard those of their own sex with. My confidence in you is not moved, but I fear the worst from his knowledge of your sex. If you repulse his attentions, and he sees fit to avenge himself by exposing your true character, you would fall a victim to your rashness in coming to see me, kind as was the motive.' Thus my father spoke to me. I knew that in his present mood I should gain nothing by revealing who the Prince was, and the dear relation in which he stood to me; and I resolved to defer it till we should reach Macao. Towards evening his Chinese physician came in and expressed his astonishment at his improved appearance, but after feeling his pulse recommended quiet. My father told him he should the next morning go on board the ship in his palanquin. The Chinese objected on the ground of imprudence but my father was positive. As the Chinese came in I busied myself with my writing materials so that I might not draw his attention too closely upon myself. `Your secretary may destroy your will now,' he said, looking at me. `Yes. I am getting well,' replied my father. `I shall need neither will nor docters! You may give me your account for services!' `In one moment it can be drawn up. With your leave I will write the sun here,' he said, approaching me. `No—no—not now! To-morrow,' cried my father, earnestly, and with agitation enough to betray me, had the Chinese previously had the least suspicion of the truth. I kept my seat and preserved the composure of my countenance. I gave him my pen and pointed to the paper before me! I remained perfectly quiet while he wrote. He then returned me the pen and as he took it I saw his eye rest upon my hand an instant.' `What a moment of danger. He was struck with its very small size and perfect whiteness, I have no doubt,' said Mary Hood. `From my hand his block head-like eyes glanced at my face, and he seemed for a moment to be scanning my features. `Of what nature is your secretary?' he asked, looking at my father. `Of mixed blood.' `He has a hand like that of an English woman, whose pulse I once examined at Macao. I have never seen such a hand since. And what is more his face is strikingly like hers.' `What woman?' gasped my father. `The Chinese named my mother by her maiden name. He said it was eighteen years before. I thought my father would have fainted — It was with difficulty I could command my self-possession at so trying a moment. The Chinese flew to my father and would have applied restoratives; but seeing my coolness my father rallied. The Chinese doctor then returned to my desk on which he had left his bill; as he took it up he eyed me with a close look, so strange and peculiar that it made me shudder involuntarily. The next moment he left the apartment, and from the lingering glance of suspicion he gave me as he went ont. I was convinced that by some means or other he had seen through my deception. `Clara,' exclaimed my father, `that man has discovered your sex! He is a physician, and a man also, singularly observing. He has penetrated your disguise! He hastens to the authorities. You must fly this moment. The danger is imminet! Oh, how could you be so rash as to place yourself in such peril. Fly to the house of the American Consul this moment. Declare who you are and apply to him to get you conveyed to the ship without delay. I will order my palanquim and follow with as much despatch as possible.' I felt the whole force of my danger. I was however calm and perfectly self-possessed. I fled to my dear father, hurriedly embraced him and hastened from the house. On reaching the outer door I looked earnestly towards the dwelling on the opposite side hoping to see Norman. I crossed the street and inquired of a slave if he was in. He said he had been out three or four hours. The secret hope of his aid took flight at this announcement, and looking round to see that I was not observed by the Chinese doctor, I went at as quick a pace as I dared, (for I did not wish, in case the Doctor should see me, to appear to be fleeing) I proceeded in the direction of the American Consul's which I knew to be on the opposite side of the square. I had got about half way across the square when I saw the Chinese physician approaching followed by six men, whom from their badges and dress I knew to be officers of the Chinese police. I knew then that I was discovered and that they were probably going to my father's to seize me or to ascertain if their suspicions were correct. The Chinese saw me and shouted! I instantly turned aside as they were between me and the consul's and tried to gain the quay where I saw several English and American boat's crews with their boats waiting to return to their ships. To reach them and cast myself upon their protection was my only hope of safety. I fled like the wind. I had all my faculties of self-possession about me. If I had been overcome by any fear I should have fallen to the ground. The shout of the Chinese doctor was caught up by the officers with him, and echoed by the others; and the cry in Chinese of `A woman—an English woman!' resounded through the square! As I was observed to be flying as if from pursuit all eyes were directed towards me and a hundred feet thundered behind me. I had but one object in view—to gain the boats! Each instant I got nearer and nearer to them, but my pursuers ran faster than I, while others crossing the square endeavored to stop me. Behind and around me I heard louder and fiercer the terrible cry of vengeance! I was within twenty feet of the boats! My enemies were not half that distance behind me! The seamen had heard the cry and understood it! They were English and French and about twenty in all. Seizing oars and other weapons they sprang to the shore to protect me crying `She is an English girl under false colors! Let us keep the bloody Chinese off!' Their words sounded like the voice of Hope! I gathered new confidence and bounded onward. But the hand of the Chinese doctor was laid on my shoulder and I believed that my last hour was come! At this instant my eyes fell on the form of my husband standing up in his boat which was approaching the pier with astonishing swiftness. He waved his hand to me in token of his knowledge of my danger and leaping to the shore called on his men to follow him. I heard his voice above the shouts of rage uttered by the Chinese! I heard him cheering on the seamen! The Chinese were dragging me away! I heard pistols fired and saw cutlasses flashing in the air above the heads of the maddened multitude. Nearer and nearer sounded the voice of my husband. Steel clashed against steel around me! My eye-sight became obscured! I felt warm blood upon my hands. Groans filled my ears. The strong grasp of the Chinese who held me relaxed, and I retained my consciousness just long enough to feel that I was clasped to the bosom of my husband, when I became insensible.' The young wife of the privateersman paused a moment as if affected even now by the recollection of peril. Mary Hood expressed her emotions by tears and exclamations of surprise and sympathy. After a brief pause, the fair narrator continued her narrative.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. THE WRECK. `When I recovered my consciousness,' continued the daughter of the Indian Merchant, `I found myself in the cabin of the Americanship —Norman was bending over me! After I was able to listen he told me that he had gone to his schooner that day for the purpose of resuming his American costume, for the English officers by whom he did not wish to be recognised had left the place. He wished to return as an American and thus presenting himself before my father, claim me as his bride. On his way back, and when his boat was near the landing, he witnessed the excitement on shore and recognised me as I flew before my pursuers. The rest you know Clara!' `What a fortunate escape! How romantic! and how brave and noble he is!' said Mary Hood in tones of strong admiration for the hero of her friend's story; and the fact that that very hero had been in her presence that day she could scarcely realize. `But how came you on board the American vessel?' `Norman proceeded to tell me. He said that after he succeeded in getting me into his boat and his oarsmen had got some ways out from the landing, numerous boats crowded with the Chinese also put off and gave him chase with loud cries. He said that to have reached his own vessel without being overtaken would have been impossible, and seeing that he was much nearer the `William Grey' he directed his men to make for her; and he just succeeded in getting on board with me when the Chinese boats to the number of a hundred, surrounded the ship.— The pursuers were, however, prevented from coming on board by the interposition of a French brig of war lying near, and finding that their prey had escaped them they reluctantly pulled back towards the city!' `Your father will be on board soon,' said Norman to me. `He has already been advised of your safety. As the ship will weigh the instant he comes along side, I will leave you in charge of your friend here Captain Ferris and proceed to get my own vessel under sail! I will follow you' he added in a low tone, for the Captain of the ship that moment entered the cabin; `and be at Macoa as soon as you are there! I will then wait on your father and declare to him our union, and obtain his sanction!' `But would he have been pleased at your marrying a stranger and a privateersman!' `Norman was not a stranger to me! I knew all his history! To be a privateersman is not dishonorable, else Norman would not be one!— It is an honorable mode of warfare—though, it is true, men without honor often command privateers. As to his family he is noble!' `Noble?' `Yes. He is descended from a noble Irish family!' `Is Norman Irish?' `Why this surprise. You must not judge of the Irish, Mary, from those you see in this country. The Irish gentleman rarely comes this side of the sea; though in the southern states some of the most distinguished families, Norman tells me, are descended from Irish ancestors. A southerner's idea of an Irishman is very wide from yours as a northerner. Two very opposite classes settle in each portion of the country. The south the Irish gentleman seeks as his abode. The north is the Irish peasants home. Here he can find labor. In the south the slave takes his place. Believe me, dear Mary, the true Irish gentleman is the truest nobleman of the earth.' `I thought it strange if Freemantle was an Englishman that he should fight against his own country.' `As an Irishman he is the friend to the free. He recognises no claim that England has upon his loyalty. He feels that she holds her dominion over his green island by right of conquest alone; and his heart throbs in sympathy with the great heart of liberty which gives life to America. But I forget my story. My father came on board and embraced me as if I had been restored to him from the grave. We passed down the river with a fair wind. I went on deck at sunset and far astern I recognised my husband's schooner under Spanish colors close following in our wake.' `Did not your father know who saved you?' `He was told by the captain of the ship that it was the commander of a Spanish schooner; and when he bade me relate to him the circumstances he said he never should feel right until he had seen and expressed his grateful acknowledgments to the young stranger.' `And did you not then tell him?' `No. I waited till I should reach home and Norman should be with me to plead, by his presence, his own case. The next day we left the mouth of the river, the schooner still in sight, and were crossing the channel with a fair wind when we were met by one of those terrific Monsoons which at that season sweep the Indian seas. It lasted three days with terrible violence, driving us eastward. On the fourth morning we found ourselves at about six hundred miles to the east of Macao and our ship in a very unsafe condition. The Captain bore up for the first port and in entering it we struck upon a rock and the ship parted. We were saved by the boats. The place at which we landed was an obscure port in Spain; and there we remained five weeks before we could obtain conveyance from the island. The vessel in which we took passage was a chinese coaster, and after two weeks beating to windward we reached Macao. We found on arriving there that we had been given over as lost; and a statement to this effect was published in the Gazette. `My first inquiries were if a schooner answering the description of Norman's had been there; and to my great grief and disappointment, as you may conceive, I learned that it had sailed away only two days before. `While I was sympathising with Norman's grief for my supposed loss, my friend the elderly gentleman, came in and handed me a letter, saying, `The brave captor of Lif, who thank heaven has been beheaded, has been thrice into the harbour in the last two months. He came hoping to hear from you—so you see you have made an impression. He was very sad when he had at last to believe that you were dead. He left in great melancholly two days ago, leaving with me this letter which I was to give you should you re-appear, (of which he had little hopes, for his own vessel scarcely outlived the monsoon,) and if not destroy it.' `You may judge, dear Mary, with what emotions I seized the letter; as soon as I could I hastened away to read it where the emotions of my countenance could not be observed.' `Have you got the letter, Clara?' `I have it, and also have it in my memory, You shall know the purport of it. It informed me that he still had faint hopes of my being yet alive, and that in that hope he addressed me. He said that he had been three times into Macao, hoping that intelligence had reached them from us, but that now he could no longer remain, as his crew insisted on returning to the United States; and you know that the crew of a Privateer, are almost as independent as their commander. He said that he should cruise in the Atlantic after reaching the United States until he should hear from me, if I were still alive, and that I must address him at Boston. This was the substance of the letter, Mary.' You may be assured that I lost no time in informing him of my safety; and as my father had decided on account of his health to close his business in India and return to the United States, I was able to communicate in the same letter this intelligence to him; and desiring him not to sail again for India to meet me, but await me at Boston. I at the same time wrote him that he should soon learn from me about what time we should sail and probably what ship we should take passage in.' `And did you write him before you sailed?' asked Mary Hood earnestly. `Yes.' `Then he must have suspected that you were on board the Indiaman and this accounts for his persevering efforts to save her from capture by the sloop.' `He has since told me he had a presentiment that I was in the vessel, though he did not know her to be the one I had written we should embark in. Now you know, dear Mary, my whole history thus far.' `It is as interesting as a romance. What a heroine! And he what a hero! And have you not yet told your father that you are married?' `No. Norman in his letter left for me, had advised me to keep it secret until he should have an opportunity of revealing it himself.' `And will he do so?' `As soon as he returns from Boston. He will then have an interview with my father and unfold all.' `Do you fear the result?' `No. When my father learns that it is the same stranger who saved me from the rage of the Chinese, and who saved both himself aud me, from capture by the British, I do not fear the result. Norman has certainly won me since I became his bride.' `He has indeed. Oh, I have the most lively curiosity to know how it will terminate. I do hope your father will receive the intelligence kindly,' `I am sure he will!' `You are at least married, and this he cannot prevent! He must consent!' `Norman will not at first tell him he is married to me! He will first unfold to him all that has transpired and which you know; and as I shall be present, I shall corroborate each part of his narrative. Norman will at last make known to him our union. My father will be very much surprised, but I have no doubt that he will give it his sanction; for he lies under too great an obligation to Norman to refuse it. The sun is already down. Let us return to the house fair couzin!' `But first tell me the meaning of the device upon the flag of your bold Privateer?' `A green mantle flying free in the wind?' `Yes.' `It is the emblem of his house! One of the ancestors of his family, the Founder of it indeed, was besieged in his castle by an army of Britons. He sallied out of his gates upon them carrying in his hand his banner. It was struck from his grasp by a knight and the banner was trampled upon the earth. The warrior instantly took from his shoulders his mantle and fastening it to a spear waved on his followers. The spear was wrested from him in the fight and broken, when the mantle flying loose upon the wind floated in the air above his head and remained thus, sustained by the wind, until the Irish Chief had fairly routed his foes and victory declared on his side. This is the legend! From this miraculous event, a mantle floating free in the air, was adopted as the insignia of his house. Norman has recently learned that the present representative of his family, Earl Freemantle, is an usurper, and that the title vested in his own father who was the first heir, but who had not only been defrauded out of his lawful rights by this brother, but by his wicked influence expelled the country on a charge of being the leader of one of the factions that some years since divided Ireland. To call this uncle to an account, he will visit Great Britain as soon as this war is ended. With one more chapter we bring our romance to a termination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. CONCLUSION. The morning after Herbert Vincent's visit to the prison in which Keith was confirmed, he was pacing the deck of the privateer as she lay at anchor off the north pier. He was revolving in his mind a plan, which he had conceived from the first moment of his interview with Freemantle, of taking the command of the privateer into his own hands even at the expeuse of blood. There was in the character of this young man a feeling of reckless desperation, engendered by the circumstances in which his conduct as an officer in the Navy had placed him. He felt that he had forfeited his portion in society, and that upright men regarded him with distrust and withheld their confidence. But more than by these considerations was he annoyed, by the withdrawal of the confidence of Col. Hood and of Henry. He was fully aware that they would never give their consent to his union with Mary; and that if he wished to make her, who he believed was still attached to him, his wife, it must be done by stratagem. He, however, was too well acquainted with the pure morality and high sense of filial obedience of the young girl to hope that she would yield her consent to a clandestine union with him, however strong might be her attachment to him. He had, therefore, conceived the idea of getting possession of Freemantle's vessel, and anchoring her off the villa endeavor to get her into his possession and so compel her to a union with him. His subsequent course he had not clearly decided upon; his first movement would be to get possession of the schooner; his second to get Mary Hood into his power. The future he left to be decided by circumstances. If the war continued he resolved to pursue a course of privateering adventure; and should it terminate he knew that there was upon the wide sea a field for the most daring enterprize. As he paced up and down the deck he occasionally looked shore-ward with an earnest scrutiny, as if in search of some object. At length he saw a small boat put off from an inlet point near the customhouse dock and approach the schooner. As it came near he recognised the tall figure of Keith, though disguised in a truckman's frock. `So you have escaped without giving alarm,' he said to the Englishman as he came upon deck; and addressing him in a tone that his men could not overhear. `Yes; I am here. I met with no difficulty. My disguise was faithful to me. My men will be free to night by their underground passage.' `Your men I don't want! I will take you on board. Captain, on the terms agreed on.' `I have come alone as you see! I agree to the conditions. You have a fine craft here!' `Yes. With your aid in twenty-four hours I will be master of her and you second in command! I have full authority now on board. The mate whose place I have taken left yesterday. I wait only for Freemantle. He is in the city and sent me word he should be on board at ten. My boat is on shore waiting for him! Remove your frock, Captain Keith, and go forward and comport yourself as one of the crew. You will sound each man.' `I know my duty,' answered the Englishman in a tone somewhat imperious. Nevertheless he moved slowly forward and mingled with the men. The privateer's boat was now visible, approaching from the pier. As she came near, Herbert saw that Freemantle was on board.' `So, sir, you are at your post,' he said as he stepped on deck, addressing Vincent in a tone friendly but with the air of a superior. `It is so great an honor to hold command under you, Captain Freemantle, that I have not let any delay intervene between my appointment and the assumption of my duties.' `I saw my mate on shore! He told me he had resigned his place to you. If you please, I will take the ring by virtue of which you were enabled to assume command. Now I have news to communicate to you. Intelligence has just reached the city that a treaty of peace has been concluded.' `Concluded?' repeated Vincent with surprise. `Yes. Henceforth my vocation as a Privateersman is at an end.' `And mine also, I suppose,' responded Herbert, not making any effort to disguise his mortification. `Yes, as my second in command! But as I know you desire to be at sea, and might not love so soon to resign and stay on shore, (though for the present I am not sorry to cast anchor on the land awhile,) I am willing you should take the command of the vessel, if you will accept it, and run her to the West Indies as a trader! You can make money in this way, and I am content with a fair share of the proceeds of your adventures!' Herbert was silent for a moment or two. This proposition with the news of peace and of Freemantle's intention to remain on shore, gave a new aspect to affairs. He did not regret that an opportunity for possessing himself of the schooner without bloodshed, was thus thrust into his hands by the retirement of her late commander. He saw that by complying with his proposal the schooner was virtually his; for the idea of ever returning with her to Boston, was not in his mind. `I will take the schooner as you propose, Captain Freemantle,' he replied. `You honor me with such confidence in me.' `If I had not confidence in you, Mr. Vincent, as a gentleman and sailor, I certainly should not make this proposal to you,' answered Freemantle, who had no suspicion of the true character of the unprincipled young man. He knew he had been an officer in the navy and that he had been cashiered; but Mary Hood, with whom he had conversed about Vincent, had explained the circumstances to him so as to exculpate him in his mind from any act dishonorable to his reputation. He knew also that he was a young man of good family, and in the possession of no inconsiderable property. He, therefore, gave him his confidence. After remaining on board an hour with Vincent, Freemantle took his leave, and Herbert followed his retiring boat with looks of exultation. `Now am I master here, thanks to the credulity of one who has more courage than caution in his make. A trader to the Havana! We shall see when we get outside! The wide sea is all before me where to choose. But I must first sound my men! I must see who will go with me! I would Keith were now safely back in prison, for I have more fear of him than need of him now, that Freemantle has given up the vessel of his own accord. I must get rid of him! Then I must get possession of my sweet bride elect, and then circumstances shall govern my future movements.' Herbert now called Keith aft and informed him of what had occurred, and told him in a very positive manner that he wished him no longer to remain on board! The Englishman at first refused to go on shore; but Vincent threatened to give him up to the authorities, when he suffered himself to be set on shore after night-fall. Vincent then made an address to the crew: informed them of the Peace, and gave them their choice to go on shore or follow his adventures. Thirty men, only forty in number, consented to go with him. The rest chose to go ashore. `Now am I indeed master here!' said Hebert, as the last boat left with those who did not wish to follow the fortunes of the new captain; though he had merely said he was going on a trading voyage to the West Indies. `I have men enough for my present purposes. To-morrow, Freemantle says he will be on board to give me the proper papers and conclude the arrangements for my assuming the command and settling with the men. I shall not wait for him.' Thus deciding, he gave orders to his men to weigh anchor in silence. Keith, the Englishman, after being landed, remained upon the pierhead gazing back upon the schooner dimly seen through the gloom of the night. His breast was fired with rage. He paced up and down the wharf planning some scheme of vengeance. While thus engaged he saw the schooner's boats come ashore with the men. He questioned them and learned that they had declined remaining in the vessel now peace was declared. `If I only had my own men free with me,' he said as he walked aside alone, after the privateer's crew had gone up the wharf, `I would try and take her at anchor. I will go back and spy about round the prison to see if there is any prospect of the men getting out.' He was about to move up the wharf when three men passed him hurriedly. He recognized one of them by his height and walk. `Crossel!' he called in an under tone. `Ah, Captain, is it you?' `When did you escape?' `Just now! Not ten minutes ago! The rest are coming in parties of two's and three's so as not to draw attention. Our plan was to reach the North Pier and by means of shore boats, board some vessel, take her and make sail. But how came you to desert us! We are afraid to trust you.' `I only escaped first to lay my plans and have already! Come under this boat house; and as your comrades come down call them in here! There is an armed schooner with only thirty men on board, lying abreast the pier,' he said addressing all the men when they at length arrived at their rendesvouz; `you can just see her outline. That vessel must be ours! Let us remain here concealed for an hour or two, till all is quiet, and then we will possess ourselves of these shore boats tied at the stairs and pull out for the schooner.' The proposal was received by all with a murmur of deep satisfaction. Every man provided himself with oaken staves from a pile near them, and just as the old North tolled eleven they filled three boats and pulled swiftly and noiseless towards the schooner. The crew were at the windlass or aloft loosing sails; and the Englishman and his men were upon the deck and upon them ere they were aware of his approach along side. They were struck down by the oaken weapons of the boarders and overpowered. The deck of the privateer was in less than two minutes in the hands of Keith, and Herbert Vincent a prisoner in his own cabin. There was no delay in weighing the anchor. The English crew took the place of the discomfitted privateersmen at the windless. In an hour afterwards the Privateer was bowling along past Boston light before a strong norwester, and at day-light she was invisible beyond the horizon. Three weeks afterwards an armed schooner was wrecked in a tornado upon the Double Headed shot keys. Two bodies only were washed on shore. One of these was Keith the Englishman; the other that of Herbert Vincent, bound in chains. We now return to Freemantle and the villa. He returned the next day to the residence of Colonel Hood and mentioned the unaccountable disappearance of Herbert with the schooner in the night; and from Colonel Hood he received so clear and plain a history of Herbert's character, that he was satisfied he had gone with the vessel upon some lawless expedition. The young privateersman now sought an interview with Mr. Forrest. The result was that Freemantle and his bride knelt side by side before him and received his blessing. We shall not attempt to describe the surprise of all on learning that they were bridegroom and bride. Colonel Hood made Clara relate the whole story of their loves and adventures. The effect of this intelligence upon the sensitive mind of Henry Hood was painful in the extreme. He withdrew from society and gave himself up to melancholy, and at the expiration of a year he buried his disappointment in the repose of the grave. When certain information reached the Villa that Herbert Vincent was no more, the grief of Mary Hood was lessened and mitigated by the reflection that if he had lived and pursued his career he might have blackened his life by crime and ended it with ignominy. She eventually recovered from her misplaced passion, and subsequently married a nephew of `the elderly gentleman,' whom Clara had left in India, whither she at length repaired to reside and realize all the charms of a land which in her imagination had hitherto been one of fable and fiction. Freemantle, shortly after the recognition of his marriage by Mr. Forrest, visited Ireland, and ultimately succeeded in establishing his claim to the heriditary seat of his noble ancestry, of whose courage and virtues he was a noble and faithful representation.
