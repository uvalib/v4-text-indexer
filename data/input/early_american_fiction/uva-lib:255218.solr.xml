      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. `This storm seems bent on mischief. It howls As if 'twere hungry.' The tide was at flood, and the rising winds heaped the waves and dashed them against the crazy pier, till it shook again. The sea poured in torrents beneath the dark corridors under the wharves, and then reflowing, moaned and roared, chafed and foamed, like furious beasts battling together. It was a wild, black night on the land and on the sea. Before the day closed, the threatening skies had given token of the storm, and white-winged craft flying to port for safety, soon filled the crowded anchorage: while the storm-loving gall stretched his pinions seaward, to revel in the coming hurricane. Vessels that seemed securely anchored sent out a second anchor to strengthen the first; and all light spars were sent donw from aloft. The hay-maker on the meadows that bordered the water, hurried to load his team, and hasten homeward ere the clouds, so rapidly darkening the heavens, should pour upon him its magazines of wind and rain. In the city, the careful house-wife looked to her shutters that they were secure; and the tradesman took in his flapping awnings; and the milliner housed her fluttering show goods. The horseman upon the road spurred and rode at top speed to reach the city, and even the stage coachman quickened the pace of his four-in-hand, by words of encouragement and warning. At length the storm came down hastening the approach of night, and a thousand candles lighted up the sudden gloom of the streets. Ere the sun went down it had become dark; and wilder roared the winds, and heavier fell the fierce rain. At length after two hours' raging, the rain ceased, but the winds howled the louder from the silence of the falling torrents. The waves of the harbor were lashed to foam, and surged and fumed and loudly bellowed among the cedar piles of the docks, as if they would lift and toss them into the air, while the piers of an ancient wharf that was fully exposed to its power, bent and swayed, as if the storm would uproot and overwhelm it. This wharf was situated in the oldest part of Boston, in the quarter now know as the North End. It projected from the end of a narrow and crooked lane that led to the harbor-side, and was properly the continuation of the lane upon piers. Its length was about two hundred feet; and one half of it was lined with a row of dilapidated habitations, most of them of very old date. The wharf was therefore in part a street, one side opened to the dock. On both sides of the wharf, with a narrow slip only to separate them, were other piers almost as ancient in appearance as the one we describe, but less burdened with houses, there being but a long store-house on one, and but a mere shed for storing the boats and sails of fishermen on the other. In the slips lay a few small craft, and numerous skiffs, wherries, dug-outs and yawls, either secured to wooden pins in the piles, or drawn up on the muddy shore at the head of the docks. When the storm and night came on, the wind whistled and howled, and swept with irresistible violence over these desolate piers, and the waves tossed the small boats like feathers, dashing many of them in pieces, and sinking them at their moorings; and so strong was the hurricane that even a yawl that was up-turned on the wharf, was righted and blown into the dock, and the boat-shed unroofed. Nevertheless, there was one human being to be seen amid the wild desolation, standing partly sheltered by the side of the last house on the old pier which we have described. He was wrapped in an old pea-jacket, tied by the sleeves about his throat; and a glazed seaman's hat protected his head from the storm. He could only be seen by the occasional flashes of lightning which for a moment revealed his face and form. He was evidently young, and of good figure; and his attention seemed to be fixed wholly down the harbor, as if he were there expecting some one to arrive. The house against which he stood for protection against the strength of the blasts that swept the end of the wharf, was the last of a row of seven irregularly constructed buildings that extended quite up to the end of the lane, and joined the south row of houses upon it. Some of these houses were two stories high, with gables and dormer windows which betrayed the style of the last century, and others were but one story, with the roof shelving five or six feet over the windows and doors, so that a person could walk beneath, sheltered from sun and rain. The last house of this line of ancient and worn out file of habitations, was two stories in height, with a high, hipped roof, and between the first and second story was a roof-like projection that sheltered the entrance and the windows from rain, an architectural appendage, called, in the language of the old time when it was built, an eaves-dropper. The windows in this house were of very small dimensions, and set with panes of glass not bigger than a child's primmer, and those in the gable end had each a bull's eye in the centre. This house wore the aspect of great age, but betrayed evidences of having, in a former day of prosperity, been a mansion of some consideration. There was an elaborate cornice, carved with great skill and care, running all around beneath the eaves, and the tops of the windows were arched, and ornamented with a wolf's head set in the centre of the arc; while the door was surmounted by a sculptured oaken urn. But these relics of former dignity and respectability, were now blackened with age, and were scarcely visible from the dust that had filled up all the sculptured and carved depressions, while a dark green mould covered all alike. The hour of the night on which we open our story is early; the nine o'clock town bell not having get warned all peaceful citizens that it was time to think of repose. Here and there the young man could see, as he turned his eyes town-ward, there glimmered a light from some upper window; but generally the streets were dark, for the closely fastened shutters hid the candles that burned within. In the row of houses on the old pier, there was not visible a single ray either shining from the windows, or escaping from the chinks of the clap-boards, save in the house situated last upon the wharf. Although the door was fast and the shutters closed, a faint stream of light escaped through a crevice, showing that the house, dilapidated as it was, was tenanted, and that the inmates had not retired like their poorer neighbors, who were too indigent to sit up and burn candles, or else too weary after their day's toil. The beam of light that escaped from the crevice in the broken shutters, fell upon the side of the young man's face as he changed his position, and gleaming upon his sight, caused him to turn towards it; but its brightness small and fine as the pencilled ray, vividly contrasting with the darkness, blinded him and he stepped aside from it, saying impatiently in a half tone, `Will they never put out their light, and go to bed? It must be near nine o'clock. Hark! there is the bell now. How loud it rings, as if the winds that bear it along had lent it voice. It rattles and clatters with the storm, as if it were as mad as it. This is the signal for quiet in the whole town, and I hope the good folks here will heed it and get to bed. But this wild night after all may keep Ogilvie from reaching here. It does not look as if a boat could live on the water. But I will maintain my post till midnight, and if he does not come by that time, I shall give him up as lost in this gale, or as having kept out to sea. It is a confounded hard night to be on the water in. It is though enough to stand watch here.' Thus speaking, he folded his arms together upon his chest, and began to pace quickly up and down the wharf, beneath the protection of the eaves-dropper already described. Sometimes he would stop and listen at the door and window, as if he heard voices within; and then stand and watch the harbor, availing himself of the flashes of lightning that from time to time illumined the horizon, to penetrate the dim distance. But all that he could discern were the caps of the white waves, here and there a vessel chafing and plunging at its anchor, and in the remote space, the faint outlines of the islands. At length the deep mouthed bell ceased its clamor, and only the angry splashing of the water against the slimy piles of the wharf, the shrieking of the wind about the roofs of the old tenements, and the steady foot-fall of the lonely night watcher was heard. `It is a fearful night abroad, father,' spoke a young girl within the old house we have described, as a sudden blast shook it till the plastering fell, and the candle at which she was sewing flared till it nearly went out. `I pity the poor seamen.' She had scarcely spoken, when a second strong sweep of the wind made the crazy old building reel, while the sound of boards and shingles torn violently off, and the creaking of the timbers with the sensible swaying motion of the piles on which the wharf stood, caused her to drop her work, and rise to her feet, pale and terrified, and to grasp, as if for safety, the hands of an infirm old man, who sat in a leathern arm-chair near the pine table at which she had been seated. `The house will certainly be blown over into the water.' `It is a fearful storm, child; but the old place has stood many as heavy in its life time. Do not fear, Jennette.' These words were spoken with a kind and courageous tone, as if he loved his daughter, and would remove her fears, which were by no means groundless; for the tottering fabric, based as it was upon such an insecure foundation, seemed to reel at the breath of the blast, as if it would momently fall about their heads, burying them in its fragments. The attitude of the young girl as she clung to her father with mingled affection and terror, was strikingly graceful; while the slight expression of alarm which had paled her features, had deepened their interest. She was not more than eighteen, though full that, as the womanly maturity of her person showed. Her figure was tall, without too much height, and her head finely set. There was a charm in her face which arrested the eye, and at once took captive the heart. It was not the beauty of her features which were exquisitely formed, nor the soft gazelle-like purity of her eyes, nor the glorious abundance of her dark brown hair, that gave to her a lovliness above her sex, but a nameless fascination in the expression of her countenance. Sweetness, gentleness, purity and love, were written there like the notes of music. Yet the gentleness of her soul was not without courage, nor her love without spirit and character; for the existence of these stronger feelings was betrayed in the sparkling brilliancy of her glance, and in the firm compression of the beautiful mouth, now closed with mingled alarm and expectation. She was clad in a simple gown of dark calico, that fitted her rounded bust with the most symmetrical neatness; and her dark, rich hair was parted on her pure forehead, and simply gathered back, braided and tied with a ribbon of the same color. She wore no ornaments, not even a ring upon her small, white hand, upon which, however, shone brightly a well-worn silver thimble, its constant ornament. (See Engraving.) She stood for a moment in the beautiful attitude of mingled fear and affection in which we have rapidly sketched her, and then as the winds seemed to increase and the house to shake still more fearfully, she said, `Father, we must escape. You will certainly perish here should the house fall.' `I am in hopes it will stand the storm, child. I see you fear more for me than yourself: so let your fears rest. And besides, whither can I go? All whom we know live in as poor tenements as mine, and are as likely to be turned out of doors to-night as we. Listen! The heavy blast has gone by, and the old rafters stand. God will protect you and I, child.' `I know it, sir. I did wrong to fear and doubt. But when I thought how helpless you were, with a broken leg, and such poor health, my heart leaped into my mouth as the old house shook so. I am young, and could fly in time, but not so with you, dear father.' `And you would not leave me, that I know, my brave girl,' said her father, as he drew her to his breast, and kissed her affectionately upon the cheek. `The wind has gone down. This last blow that terrified us so, and made the rotten boards fly, was the last effort. Have you got through your day's task?' `Not yet, father; I shall complete it in a little while,' answered the maiden, as she reseated herself and took out her sewing. Her father sat and gazed silently upon her, his face resting upon his hand which clasped a crutch staff. The light of the candle shone upon his frank, open countenance, and revealed the boldly marked features, frosted head, of a man about fifty years of age. His eye was yet bright, and expressive of kindness and resolution; while the strong arched nose and the upper lip, against which the under one closely shut, indicated firmness and endurance. His forehead was bald, smooth, and finely shaped, and the expression of his face was the subdued, resigned one often shown by men of active habits of life who have been cut down in the midst of their career by long infirmity or clinging disease. He looked patient and serene, as if affliction had tempered and chastened the rough points of his character, and wrought in him peace and manly submission. There was a certain air about him that showed that he had once been accustomed to a better state of things than now surrounded him. His apparel was very old and much patched, like the coat of a very poor man, while the house in which he lived, as we have seen, was menaced with a fall by every storm of wind. But the apartment betrayed more plainly and positively the poverty of its occupants. Although there were several uninhabited rooms in the house, the one in which they were seated, with a small bed-room adjacent, were all they tenanted, or that were furnished; if, indeed, these two could be said to be furnished. A pine table, two straw chairs, patched with cloth and leather, a low truckle bed meanly covered, a few dishes and cooking utensils ranged in a corner, and some half dozen books upon the mantle, and a Bible, a candlestick and a work-basket upon the table, were every article visible in the room. We may add a plain straw bonnet and shawl, hanging upon a peg, and an old broad brimmed hat behind the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. `Hope, with lowliness of heart, is better far, Than full possession with a purse of pride.' As the old man, Robert Alison, for this was the name of the father of the beautiful sewing girl, rested his chin upon his staff, and gazed thoughtfully upon his child as she plied her bright needle, he looked sad, and a heavy sigh escaped him. Jennette looked up from the linen bosom which she was stitching, and smilingly said, for she knew he sighed for her toil: `I shall soon be done it, dear father; I have only one more plait to stitch down.' `But what avails it if you have most done this? At daylight, with the birds, you will be up and commencing another. Alas, Jennette, I cannot but sigh when I see one so young thus early doomed to toil, and—' `Not another word, dear father,' cried the young girl, playfully sealing his lips with her fore-finger. `You know it is no toil to me, I do it cheerfully.' `But I can't help feeling it. How many young ladies of your age enjoy life, and know no labor or privations, while you—' `Hark! did you not hear a footfall?' she said, raising her head and listening. `I certainly hear a step outside the door.' `It is doubtless some fisherman come down to look after the safety of his boats; though it is a rough time for any one to be abroad. The water roars as dismally under the wharf as if it would gladly swallow up the whole pier. There was a crash! It was a boat dashed against one of the piles. I hope no poor man will lose his means of support to-night. Few of our poor neighbors can afford to lose a skiff. I am better off who have nothing to lose. But I am complaining, and this is wrong. I wont complain of my own destitution, but I have a right to feel for you, when I see you rising up early and sitting up late to put bread into my mouth.' `No, father, into my own! Can I live on air? It does not take a dozen more stitches a day for you than it would for me alone, and then it renders me so happy to have the privilege of doing something for you.' `But you are growing paler every day.' And it could be seen that the paleness which we at first remarked, and set down to fear wholly, was the settled paleness of confinement and close application over the needle; for there was observable no change of color in her cheek, no returning of the rich, blood to beautify them. This paleness gave a peculiar interest to her face, and lent to it, as it were, more thought and feeling. `You are growing paler every day, my Jennette!' and the tears came into his eyes, and rolled down his cheeks. As he felt them drop warm on his hand, he brushed them quickly away lest she should see them. `I never liked much color, father,' answered Jennette, in the same cheerful and cheering tone which marked all her replies. `I think your chest is getting weaker, and your voice—' `There! enough, my dear good father,' she said, affecting an air of alarm, `you will frighten me, and make me believe I am sick, when I was never so well. The thought of how happy I make you makes me well.' `You are a noble and good girl! God knows but for you, Jennette, I should now be in the alms-house! `And,' he added with a tremulous voice, `when I sit here and watch you sewing so diligently, and without any respite, spoiling your eyes and ruining your constitution, I think I had best—' `Best what, father?' she asked, looking up with surprise and doubt. `Best go to the alms-house!' `Never, never! while my hand can use a needle, never! father!' she cried with generous warmth, while her fingers shook with fearful agitation. `Oh, why can't you forget me, and be happy and contented to let me labor for you? You know, you see how gladly, how thankfully I do it.' `Yes, and it is this makes me feel worse about it.' `I know what it is, dear father,' she said archly, as her fine eyes rested on his face. `You have too much pride to be dependent on your child, and so would deprive me of the pleasure of doing what I can for you. It is only pride, father.' `No, not a bit of pride in it, Jennette, except to be proud of you! But how can I help feeling sorrowful when I see how hard you have to work that I may enjoy even the necessaries of life, though your poor little needle has brought me many comforts, too. You are up with the dawn, and when I wake I find you bent over your sewing, and your hands going like a shuttle. All day you sew, save the intervals when you cook our humble meals or wait on me, and every night when I go to bed I leave you at your needle. It is too much for you, Jennette, and I am no man, no father, to suffer you to kill yourself for such an old wreck as I am! I had better die and save your life.' `My dear father, your words grieve me to the heart. If you knew how wretched they make me you would never utter another like them. What should I do but toil night and day for you, sir?' Were you dead should I have to cease toiling for myself? You are no additional burden, dear father. You are a blessing to me, and may God in his mercy long keep you with me. It is true I am sometimes weary, but the thought that I am laboring for you renews my strength. If I had only myself to sew for, I should feel weary often, for I should not have that sweet incentive that now upholds me.' `Well, well, you are an angel, if ever there was one on this earth,' said her father, with emotion, `I will not pain your kind heart any more, as I know it does not mend the matter. Still I cannot but wish that you were better off in this world's goods. You have no idea, Jennette, how a fond father's heart bleeds at beholding his child, that child a lovely daughter of eighteen, with a face, a figure, a mind to adorn society, slaving herself to the needle from sheer poverty. If it were not that I feared God, and feel that he does right, I should feel like swearing. I sometimes think that a good round half dozen of oaths would do us both good.' `Praying is better than swearing, dear father,' answered Jennette, gently. `I know it, I know it, child. I pray for you every night and morning, and for that matter I have a prayer running through my thoughts all day. My love for you has become a prayer.' `Be assured that God will answer it, dearest father,' she replied, bending towards him affectionately, and resting her hand in his. `I have no fear, no anxiety for the futnre.' `I will try not to, love. There again is that step. A man is walking up and down beneath the eaves-dropper. He can't mean no harm, or he would be more cautious. Poor stealing a thief would find her about. It is some one, no doubt, watching for the safety of his boats.' The maiden paused an instant to listen and then resumed her stitching as the sound ceased. In a few moments more she completed her day's task, and without glancing at the neatly sewn shirt she folded it up, with a look of pleasure and a sigh of relief. It caught the ear of her father, who said, with emotion: `Would to heaven, Jennette, that were the last shirt you were ever to put a needle into.' `I should hope not, father. If I could get no more work to do, we should perish! I am thankful that I find as much as I want to do.' `No danger but you'll find enough, child, for the skillfulness of your needle is well known. Let me look at that. It is a great work for one day for your poor fingers. Do you know how many stitches there are in it?' `No, sir.' `I do! I counted them in the last you done. There are seventeen thousand and odd! You get for making this shirt sixteen cents! That is not quite a penny for every thousand stitches! It is in this way you are coining your young heart and your life, drop by drop oozing out at your fingers ends. I know not which to wonder at most, your industrious patience, Jennette, or the unblushing hardihood of the avaricious man who dares to ask you to take so mean a pittance for so much labor. `He would refuse to give me work, father, if I asked more; and there are others whom he could employ. It is a very small sum— eight cents a day—for you and I to live upon. But so long as we are permitted to live together I am thankful to have the work to do, even at this price. I am paid two cents more than others.' `Because your reputation as a neat shirt-maker has gone before you. When I was in command of the Greyhound, little did I suspect I should ever be keeled up not worth a Portuguese stiver, and my dear little Jennette supporting me at sixpence a day! Even black Cæsar, good soul, shed tears to see you work the other day.' `Dear father,' said Jennette, as if wishing to divert his mind from making painful contrasts between the present and the past, `as I have done my work, will you let me read a chapter to you before you go to bed?' `I don't care about it,' he answered, gloomily, `I begin to think that—' `Now don't say anything you'll be sorry you've uttered, dear father,' she said with playful warning. `I don't know that I shall be sorry I uttered it. The Bible says those who trust in God shall find prosperity; and what is it I have done ever since I broke my leg and lost my health but trust in him? and instead of prosperity, I am doomed to see my only child sacrifice herself by inches to maintain me and herself. If you find comfort in the Bible read in it. I don't find any there.' `My dear father, who do you love best on earth?' `You, my child.' `What would be the greatest affliction God could put upon you?' `To take you from me.' `And suppose he should bring me by sickness to the brink of the grave, and you should ask God then to fulfil the promise in his word to give prosperity, in what shape would you desire that prosperity to come?' `In restoring you to health and to my arms, my wise and good child. I see the drift of your questioning. God forgive my murmuring. Having you, I am prospered beyond all I can desire or think. Take the Bible and read where you will. I will still trust to it.' With a smiling countenance, Jennette resumed her chair, drawing it a little nearer her father; and taking the Bible in her hand she opened it, and began to read in a clear but low voice. The blast whistled about the corner of the house, and the waves dashed up beneath the floor, and the rafters creaked and shook, but she heeded nothing but the words of life and hope and peace that shone from the blessed page. These were some of the words she read: “`Oh, that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbor. “`I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark. “`He is chastened with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain. “`He shall pray unto God, and he will be favorable unto him. He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. “`Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth; for he maketh sore and buildeth up; he shall deliver thee in six troubles, yea in seven there shall no evil touch thee.”' When Jennette had done reading she closed the book, and looked in her father's face. Its discontent had vanished, and peace and hope illumined it. `There is comfort in that book, Jennette, always something to comfort one. I hope I shall never give up my confidence in it. But it is very hard to believe that we shall see good days. I have not a friend on earth, as you know, to whom I can or will apply for aid. I have so long been an invalid that those who once knew me believe me dead; for the bed-ridden is as soon forgotten as the dead. No, no, after my rebuff last year in trying to get aid, I have no one to go to. I cannot work, except I sew, and make sails, and this would, you say, irritate my blood, and give me fever. I can't walk out to seek assistance and make friends; and so how we can be better off than we now are is more than I can see. Your shilling a day, hard as it is earned, is not going to do more than buy us a little coffee and bread, and a herring or two. But I will hope! One of your hymns you sing so sweetly says it is “an anchor,” and I am too old a sailor not to know the advantage of an anchor when one is on a lee shore. So I'll hope for the best, and try and be cheerful; for I know that gloomy looks are but a poor and thoughtless return for your industrious toil, dear girl. Now give me thine own blessing, and I'll to bed.' Jennette assisted him to his feet, or rather foot, for one of his legs was drawn up and bandaged, and its place supplied by a crutch. By the aid of this and her arm, this wreck of a once strong man drew himself with difficulty to the truckle bed, upon the edge of which he sat down. She then tenderly kissed him `good night,' and leaving the light by his side, disappeared through a door on the left, with a small bit of candle in her hand. It was a small bed-room into which she entered, and, poor as she was, she had managed to give it an air of neatness and comfort, though poverty could not be wholly driven forth. A small plain board table, covered with a napkin, was placed beneath a shilling looking-glass. A few little pictures hung around, and a narrow cot bed, covered with a patch-work quilt, stood against the wall. There was no carpet upon the floor, and no pillow to the cot. Yet this little humble room had witnessed more hours of pure and peaceful happiness than the tapestried chamber of a crowned queen. In a few moments after entering her room, Jennette was sleeping as sweetly as if she were an heiress, nay, perhaps far more sweetly than if she were!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. `Thou comest in such a questionable shape!' The young man who was watching in the storm, continued to pace up and down in the shelter afforded him by the projecting roof of the house in which Robert Alison and his daughter dwelt, sometimes trying to overhear what was spoken within, and at others bending his eyes upon the white waves, as if he would penetrate the gloom in search of some object. `It is past eleven o'clock,' he at length said, speaking in a tone of mingled dissatisfaction and impatience. `He will not be here to-night. I may as well return to the Inn. Yet, the light sky in the north looks as if it would break away by midnight. The rain has long since ceased, and that blast a while ago, that made me think this old rookery would blow over, was the last of the tempest; for it has been lulling ever since. I will go up to the tavern and take something, and then, if it clears up, will come down again.' He lingered a moment, to take a more thorough survey of the harbor, so far as he could do so in the gloom of the night, and was turning away, when he saw a human figure standing directly in his path, and close to him. Evidently, the person did not see him till he had emerged from the dark shadow under the eaves-dropper, for, upon discovering his appearance, he uttered an exclamation of surprise, and started, as if to run away. But the young man sprung forward like a bold spirit who knows no fears, and grasped him by the arm. `Who are you?' he sternly demanded. `Don't skweeze nigger's arm kwite so hard, massa!' responded the fugitive, in a board African dialect, while he endeavored, by various contortions of his body, to disengage himself from the hold the young man had upon him. `What are you doing here?—mischief, I will wager!' `No, massa, I jist come down see if 'em storm done rainin!' `A likely story; you could tell that without sneaking down here at the end of the pier, and dodging me! you was watching me, you rogue!' `Nebber, massa, nebber!' answered the negro, in tones of deprecation, `I only come see if—if—' `If what? tell the truth, and no stammering, or I'll souse you in the dock.' `Bress you, don't massa,—wy, I wet nuff now,' answered the negro, as if he was speaking half in jest. `I come down to see how massa Cap'n Robert come on—now you hab de gospel truf.' `And who is massa Cap'n Robert?' `Sh, massa! he lib in here—he an' Missy Jenney; dey hear us!' `And who is Miss Jenney?' `She massa Robert's da'ter, and handsome and good as an angel; ony dey 'mazin sorrowful poor!' `Poor, are they? So I should think, to live in such a rickety old castle as this.' `Best dey hab, massa—de berry best dey can get, coz dey monstrous poor,—and massa Cap'n he got a broke leg, and bed-ridd, and Miss Jenney hab to sew, and get um libbin; and she hab berry leetle fingers, and can't do so much work wid 'em, and sometimes dey 'mazin hard run for eatin.' `They are? well, that is bad—especially for an old captain and his lovely daughter.— Is he a sea captain?' `He hab been, onct, massa—but you see five years ago, he shipwreck him brig, and she dead loss, and he brake him leg wid a spar fallin' on it, tryin' to save him life.' `That was a pity. How did he save it with a broken leg?' asked the young man, who had gradually released his hold upon the honest black, and listened to him with interest—for the idea of an old seaman and his lovely daughter suffering together in poverty, seemed to move him. `I take him on my back, and lash him on um spar, and swim ashore wid him.' `That was a noble act! So you were in the brig then?' `I was de steward, massa.' `And the captain is now in want, you say, and living here?' observed the young man, lowering his voice, as he looked up at the house in front of which they stood. `Yes, inassa,' answered the negro, who seemed pleased to find the person who had so hastily seized him, was taking a friendly interest in his old captain's condition; you see de owners blamed him, coz de brig wan't insured, and de owner ob cargo blame him, and say he lost de brig coz as how he was careless—and nobody'd give him 'nother vessel— and dis broke him heart was dan him leg was broke, and so he kept frettin and frettin', and him leg nebber get well wid de feber he puts it in. So him wife die, and dat make him feel wusser, and den him money go, and him furniture and ebbery ting; and nobody help him, and he too proud to tell how poor he be, and so dey libes here out ob de world, like, and Missy Jenney sew all de time, night and day, makin' shirts; and massa Cap'n he worry 'coz she hab to sew, and dat make him wus. But, massa, he nebber lose him brig from carelessness! He see de Boston light, and steer strait on him course; and all a once blows up um fog, and comes 'tween him and de light. But he tell by de compass whar it be, and steer on in de fog—and jus as he git fur nuff to turn in de channel, and gib de order, de brig struck, and de masts went by de board! It no fault ob de Cap'n, and some merchants and Cap'ns say so—but odders said it was; and massa nebber got ober it.' `And what are you coming here to see them for at such a late hour, and in such a storm?' `It don't blow hard as it did, massa, and you see when I heard de wind whistle, and de rain beat on my shanty, I tinks ob massa Capn'n and Miss Jenney down here in deir old house, on de end ob de wharf, and tinks I if de wind blow wusser dey may get blowed down, 'coz I knowed how rickety de house is, and I knowed if de storm damage it, massa Cap'n couldn't save himself wid nobody but Miss Jenney, and so I get's out o' bed and comes down to see dat all am right.' `You are an honest black fellow. What is your name?' `Cæsar, massa.' `What are you employed about, now?' `Noting tiklar, massa—I mean to get a ship soon as I can.' `Then you are your own man?' `Independum as a post, massa. May I ax if you be a Cap'n or Ossifer?' `I—that is—yes, yes!' replied the seaman, with something like hesitation. `Are you willing to sail with me?' `Yes, massa, if you give good wages. I must charge high, 'coz, you see, I've made up my mind to give three quarters of my months' pay to de old Cap'n, and to make a present ob de month's advance to Missy Jenney, to buy her new dress and bonnet; for half de nigger gals in Bosting dress finer dan she does. Ebbery dime she get hab to go for bread an' butter. Gorry, how it lighten, den!' `The flash showed me your face, and I see it is a very honest one. Now, Cæsar, come to me at eight in the morning, at the Two Anchors, in Snow Lane.' `I know de place, massa.' `I'll then ship you and pay you a month's advance—twenty-four dollars!' `Dat berry good wages, massa! Cæsar sure be dere. I berry lucky nigger dis night! I make Miss Jenney happy, to morrow, sure!' `Your generous heart, my man, has made me your friend,' said the young seaman, in a tone of voice that feeling made impressive, while it deepened its naturally mellow cadences. `I hope you will not say to the captain or his daughter that you have seen and spoken with me about him.' `Bress you, massa, how can I tell him when I don't know who you is?' `You need not say you have seen any one. Come to me at eight o'clock.' `I won't miss it, sure, massa,' answered the black, who seemed rejoiced that he had a prospect of shipping,—more, that he could give his advance to Jennette, than from any selfish desire of gain. `All dark inside now, and de house safe—and as de wind is gwine down berry fast, I beliebe I won't 'sturb 'em to-night,' added Cæsar, as he surveyed the outside of the building, from which neither sound nor light proceeded. `It hab been heavy storm, massa?' `Yes, and yet blows strong, Look! you are a sailor and should know how to make out objects on the water. Tell me what that is in range of this post?' Cæsar stooped, and took sight over the low post, in a direction down the harbor, and, after a moment's observation, while the sea man was also watching the object with a searching vision, he stood upright, and said emphatically, `It a shallop scuddin', massa, sure! But she carry as much white foam on her bow, as white sail on her mast,' `I am not mistaken, then. It is the trady craft I have been looking for,' murmured the young man, `I knew that Ogilvie having once said so, would run in storm or no storm, so long as he could keep the nose of his little shallop above water.' `She comes on wid such a big bone in her teef as I nebber see, massa!' exclaimed Cesar, who was steadily watching her. `Debbel! she half mile off, and I hear her bows roar here, sure, massa!' he added with astonishment. `I dare say. The wind before which she flies brings the noise of her progress through the water. It was this sound I heard before I saw har.' The object which attracted their joint attention, was now plainly to be seen, even by a ladsman's eye, to be a schooner-rigged vessel, of small size, scudding with close reefed fore and mainsails, extended on either side, wing and wing, and steering strait for the head of the pier. The South East gale before which she flew, drove her with such speed that she carried before her cut-water, high in the air, a column of spray, looking like a third sail in the indistinetness of night. The sound of her ploughing advance reached the pier like the constant roar of a water-fall. The clouds had been sometime before breaking, and the sky above was light, and stars sparkled in the depths of space, and rendered even vessels at anchor a mile distant, sufficiently distinct in outline for their rig to be made out. The wind, however, still blew fresh; and before it, as if chased in from the sea in terror, or as if she had come in express with a message of war, the little shallop flew! Each moment she came nigher and nigher the pier, and the interest of the young man in her approach increased with her nearer advance. `She hab lower her main sail and is luffin' up, massa,' said the black. `I wonder what kind ob pilot she hab, to run in dis a way in de night?' `There is a sailor at her helm, you may be assured,' answered the seaman. `You are right—she has luffed, and is lessening her head-way. She will come to off the pier, unless—' Here he interrupted himself, and taking from beneath his sea-coat, he suddenly opened, a lantern, and turned it in the direction of the shallop. After holding it thus a few seconds, he closed the slide and replaced it beneath his coat. A light was instantly displayed on board the shallop in answer, and, after shining a moment, was withdrawn. The next minute the craft kept away a little, and steered direct for the pier. Cæsar noticed these proceeding swith surprise, and shaking his head, he murmured to himself— `I better ax dis massa what he doin' down here to-night wid dese fixin's, dan he ax me! I don't percisely like de looks ob dese here goin's on.' `Cæsar!' called the young man, as the shallop was coming down so as to glide past the head of tho pier nigh enough for a person to spring on board. `What say, massa?' `Stand by and jump on board with me!” `No, no, massa! I don't know de name ob dat craft; 'sides, I nebber ships till I signs de papers!'—and Cæsar began to retrongrade, step by step, from the head of the wharf. At this instant, the shallop swept past, and the young seaman leaped upon her deck. As she gracefully rounded the pier, and tacked to stand off, he called to Cæsar, who was fast running away— `At eight o'clock—the Two Anchors!' `Yes. massa,' answered Cæsar, but added to himself, `if I goes, I don't ship till I knows what kind o' sarvice I'm to sail in.— I doesn't like dis here business I've seen tonight; and if dis is a specimen, Cæsar'll make himself scarce. That ar' shallop 's a smuggler, I'm most sartain. Yet, de gemman seem like a berry nice man, and he feel berry great deal when I tell him 'bout massa Can'n!' Here Cæsar stopped to watch the shallop, which had no sooner taken the person on board, than it hoisted its mainsail, and stood out again; but instead of returning the way it came in, it laid its course close-hauled to the wind, and went dancing over the white caps of the waves, in the direction of the islands. Cæsar watched it till it was out of sight, and then turned away, soliloquizing upon the probable object which led her to come in one such a wild night, merely to take on board the stranger, and then steer again across the harbor. `I doesn't like its look,' he said, with a wise shake of his woolly head. `It don't look ship-shape and above board. Mischief likes darkness and slide lanters, and such nights as dis. But I'll go to de Two Anchor as I promise—but I doesn't expect to see dat gemman dere, no how. Pr'aps he means to come back afore mornin'; I shouldn't wonder. Twenty-four dollars is good wages, dese days, when dere is so many to ship, and sich few vessels goin' to sea. I'd do any ting for Miss Jenney but turn smuggler, as I fraid dis gemman be! Well, de mornin' show. I glad and tankful I find massa Cap'n and de house safe. I sure, almost, it blow down—but it am de truf, as massa said, dat dey did build de old housen stronger den, dan dey does de new ones ob dese 'generate days!' With this criticism upon modern architecture, Cæsar took his way up the wharf, and traversing the lane which led to it, he entered a narrow cross-street, which at length brought him to an obscure court, crowded with ten foot tenements. At one of them he stopped, and, after knocking twice, was let in by the dark-complexioned landlady at whose hostel he was, for the time being, while on shore, taking up his abode.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. `Hath the king set his seal to th' pardon? No! Policy, he sayeth, forbideth mercy.' When the young sailor in the watch-coat and glazed hat leaped upon the deck of the shallop, the mysterious approach and departure of which, added to the display of lights, had aroused the suspicions of Cæsar, he was grasped by the hand and welcomed with, `I was afraid you would have given us up and would not have been found. But it blew so hard outside that, although my little “Walk-in-the-water,” wanted to go with the lid in her teeth, yet if I had let her run, she would have ran under! So I had to reef close and bring her to the wind and that half a dozen times to keep her afloat, and you see we are half full of water now.' `Is all ready?' he asked of him with animation, as he put the helm hard down, to let the shallop move away from the pier. `Yes, I have been very impatient at your delay, fearing you would not come. But I have, as you see, had faith in you, notwithstanding the storm in which it seemed noth ing could swim on the water but a gull. When did you leave the cape?' `At three this afternoon. The storm took me just as I had weathered the Half-way Rock, and since then, I have been kept busy enough. If it had not been for the flashes of lightning, I should never have found my way into the harbor. But I watched these and took my bearings for the next one, and so I let her drive! But it has been a whistling gale, and hasn't blowed its cheeks out yet. Now let me know the news? What is done for me? Is there any hope? `Can you leave the deck and go below? Here the wind blows to hard to speak.' `Then I will wait till we reach the cove. This is too dangerous navigation in the darkness for me to trust any hand but my own. You see we have to keep luffing and putting away to avoid the vessels at anchor about us. But I shall make the run in a few minutes more! Have you seen Bel?' This was asked with some hesitation and feeling, and a slight flush of the cheek, for the light in the binnacle shown full upon his face, which was that of a dark, handsome and resolute looking young man of four and twenty, wrapped in a seaman's storm coat and cap. `Yes,' answered the other in a half-tone, as if he did not care to speak then about the person alluded to. `She is still—' `Still firm as ever.' `Well, I must submit as I can. I feel that the course I am pursuing is right, whatever her views may be touching me and my character.' `She esteems you and has—' `I don't ask Bel's esteem. It is her love I need,' replied he imperatively. `But let it pass now. I must give my attention to the shallop.' Thus speaking he turned his face away as if to conceal any emotion that might be upon it, for his voice had been tremulous as he uttered the last few words. They were now close in with an island which each instant rose darker and larger before them. The little town and its docks and shipping was rapidly disappearing astern, the outlines of the town looking, in the distance, like that of a vast serrated ridge. The shallop skirted the island for about half a mile close hauled to the wind and then steered direct for a cove that was on its north side. As the schooner entered it, the land seemed to embrace and enclose it, and when the anchor was dropped there was visible only a narrow outlet showing where the shallop had come in. The shores of this sheltered spot were overhung by trees, and the water was perfectly calm, for the wind did not reach it to disturb it. The steersman of the schooner directed her course so near a large rock imbedded on the edge of the shore at the upper extremity of the cove, that one could step upon it from the bows. `Although I lay the shallop against the rock, I have to anchor her with the kedge lest the ebb should draw her out,' said the master of the shallop. `Now, Gordon, shall we go on shore to the cattle-keeper's cabin, or shall I listen to you here.' `I had best let you know, Hugh, before we land, what I have to tell you,' answered Gordon, `for I have more to say than I care a third party should hear, however faithful he may be.' `Then let us below, Croft,' said Hugh Ogilvie, to one of the three men he had with him. `I want you to keep the deck and hold sharp watch. The boys can sleep, as they have been worked hard. Call me if you see any thing to excite your attention.' `Aye, aye, sir! Tom Croft, 'll do that.' responded the old seaman in a bluff, blunt voice. `I am not a bloody marine to neglect duty when any thing's to be done. Let the boys sleep if they will. Tom Croft can see more and farther with half an eye, in the dark, than both of 'em at noon day.' With these words the tough old tar; who was very short in the body and neck and wore enormous whiskers, which were only exceeded by his montrous duck trowsers, as wide as petticoats, took a fresh quid and rolled aft. The two boys, who were hardy young fishermen's sons, did not wait a second time to be permitted to sleep, but casting themselves into the folds of the foresail, they were both asleep ere Tom had shut up his jack knife and replaced it with his tobacco in his pocket. The cabin in which Hugh Ogilvie conducted his guest was small, for his vessel was small, but it had an air of sailor-like comfort that compensated for its narrow dimensions. There were berths for four persons, two on each side and as they were concealed by crimson drapery, they did not offend the eye, while the hangings themselves, were ornamental. The transom at the after-part of the cabin was covered with a cushion, and made a convenient lounge, In the centre of the cabin was a round table, above which hung a very handsome tell-tale compass.— 2 Over the transom was a small book-case containing a few nautical books, and a rack for charts. On the table stood a pair of candles, one of which was lighted. On the opposite sides of the table, were camp stools. `My accommodations are not very large,' said Hugh Ogilvie, as he entered the cabin, `but they will do very well for my present purpose. Now, my friend Gordon, sit down and let me hear all you have to say. Here is the letter which reached me early this morning at Gloucester. It explains nothing!' As he spoke he took from a drawer of the table a letter and laid it before Gordon, who had already seated himself on one of the camp-stools. Gordon mechanically opened the letter and glanced his eye over it, though his mind was evidently upon a subject wholly foreign to it. The contents of the epistle were as follows: `Summer Street, Tuesday Afternoon. My Dear Hugh: I despatch this to you by my own servant on horseback, in order that you may - e ceive it without fail. Do not detain him, but at once send him back with an answer. I have seen the governor and as eloquently as I could, without too far committing myself, I entreated his clemency towards your father. But I regret to say, he is inexorable. He said “that it became justice to be stern and unbending in his case or the world would cry out that he escaped because he was rich, and would have been hanged had he been poor.” `There is, therefore, no alternative but that which—&amp;c. &amp;c. I cannot commit too much to written words. But if you would effect what you desire, you must suffer no delay; for there are but three days to the day of execution, as you are aware. My heart bleeds for you while I write this. I will be at the old White House Pier, at nine o'clock Wednesday evening if you return me a reply that you can reach this town by that time; or I'll be any where else you designate; and there when we meet I will explain to you more fully what you will wish to know, touching what has transpired here. I am sorry to say that my sister Bella, is in the same mind, and I believe, strongly suspects some mystery is going on. I would trust her if I dared; but I fear that her feelings might prompt her to betray us. But when we meet you shall know all. Faithfully yours, Gordon Hays.' When Hugh Ogilvie, received this letter, he was on board the shallop, which was disguised as a fishing smack, and he himself wore the dress of a cape fisherman. He at once replied to it as follows, bidding the messenger to retrace the thirty miles back to Boston, with the best speed his horse could bear him. His answer to Gordon, was couched in few words: `I shall be at the pier by nine to-night, if wind and water permit. Do not fail me there. Hugh Ogilvie.' We have seen at what risks and recklessness of wind and wave he performed his promise. `Now for what thou hast to tell me,' he said, as he took a seat opposite his friend `I have waited full patiently.' And he placed his elbows upon the table and rested his chin in his hands, as he fixed his clear earnest dark eye upon the face of Gordon Hays. There was a striking contrast between the two young men, as they sat facing each other, the light of the candle falling full upon them' Gordon was of slight make, with a fair countenance lighted up by a clear blue eye full of fire and intelligence. He was rather pale and would have looked effeminate but for the resolute shape of his mouth and firm chin. Decision and energy composed the characteristic expression of his countenance. Hugh, on the contrary, was naturally dark, and sun-browned still more by exposure. His person was tall and stout without grossness, his air bold and manly and the expression of his countenance, that of a man of courage and determination. His large dark eyes were exceedingly fine, and his mouth and teeth being handsome, he was a remarkably good-looking young man. It was plain that he was every inch a sailor. Gordon, too, wore not only the outer garments of a seaman, but as he dropped the heavy watch-coat from his shoulders, the anchor buttons glistened on the cuffs of his blue jacket, showing that he was attached to the navy. But in his appearance he was more scholastic than nautical, as if he had explored libraries rather than seas, nevertheless he was a sailor and a thorough one, pale of cheek and slight of make as he was. The buttons upon his sleeve he was entitled to, both by rank and profession. `You asked me to tell you what has transpired, Hugh;' he said after a few moments' thoughtful silence, `and to explain why I brought you down here by my letter. In it, I wrote briefly that I saw the governor and that he refused my prayers.' `Tyrant!' muttered Hugh, with deep emphasis. `When did you see him?' `Tuesday, that is yesterday morning about eleven o'clock.' `Did you not press it upon him? Did you take his “no,” and leave?' `I used every argument that my love for you, my sympathy for your father, that humanity or mercy could dictate. He answered that he was sorry that he could not con sistently with his oath, pardon and release one who had been committed and sentenced. I plead the respectability and wealth of your father. But he made this an objection to clemency, saying that the poor would cry out “Partiality.”' `And he would sacrifice my father to this out-cry! I am sorry, now, since I have taken such steps as I have, that I suffered you to lower yourself by asking a favor of the selfish tyrant. You are satisfied then, that there is no hope of pardon?' he added with a faltering voice. `None, whatever.' `Not even Bella's influence? Oh, that she, whom he so loves and idolizes, that she were my friend! One word from her would obtain his pardon.' `I have no doubt of it. He could hardly refused her any favor. She can fold him about her fingers at her will.' `Do you not suspect she has found out my plan and influenced her uncle?' ventured Hugh, but cautiously, as if the suspicion were too unfair torwards the maiden. `No, no! Bel would not take any such a part.' `No, she would not! I wrong her. She is all that is noble and good. I can't blame her for casting off a lover whose father is to be hanged. But I am very miserable nevertheless, Gordon! I loved her as if earth owned no other woman.' `Be a man, Hugh! Be a man, and don't let tears make you play the girl. Bel loves you yet! It is only her pride that has caused her to show the cold shoulder to you.' `She hates me, that is very certain. Well, I will not, cannot cease to love and worship her. The sweet, dear memories of our past joy, no power not even her hate, can deprive me of. Does she speak of me?' `No, Hugh, yet, believe me, I know you are never absent from her thoughts.' `If I could only think so!' he said with a deep sigh of mingled sadness and pleasure. `Be sure of it! But the hour waxes late. I am here to tell you that there is no hope of the governor's pardon, and that the plan you proposed and which you have matured to meet this contingency, remains to be carried out, as the only one to be trusted to! I will now state how far I have gone towards bringing about my part.'</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. `The plot thickens! Be diligent and bold, Confirm the timid by largesses of gold.' The young naval officer, Gordon Hay, thus commenced his narration of the part he had borne in the plan which had been in contemplation for the release of Ogilvie's father, provided all appeals to the Executive failed. `After I quitted the presence of the governor,' said Gordon, `I was satisfied that there remained no other course for me to pursue, than to take the steps we had proposed, and for which you purchased and prepared this shallop. At first, I hardly knew how to act, as it was not safe to trust any one with my purposes. If I could have taken Bella into my confidence, she has so much spirit and courage that by her aid I could have effected anything.' `I am sorry that she is so hostile to me,' said Ogilvie, sadly. `My destiny is a hard one, Gordon, to be rejected without any fault of my own!' `I sympathize with you, Ogilvie. Upon reaching home, I shut myself up in my room, to think out the best way to proceed, now that there was no other alternative left but immediate action. At length I formed my plan, and, sitting down and writing you the note which you received, I despatched it, and then left the house. Without stopping any where, I took my way to the prison, and, with as much precaution as I could use, I made a thorough survey of its exterior. The result was, I satisfied myself that it would be impossible for your father to escape by any other means than by stratagem. If files could be conveyed to him, and he could open the bars of his cell, he could not descend to the ground without ropes; and, as he is a large, heavy man, I am sure he could not get through the small window of his apartment. Of this, I felt very certain, and therefore abandoned the idea I had conceived of carrying to him in a loaf of bread, a file.' `Could you have bribed the baker?' `I have little doubt of it—I was in his shop two or three times, and sounded him so far as to lead me to believe that prompt and large money at the proper moment, would secure him on our side. But the height of the walls, and the constant guard in the prison, led me, after a close inspection, to abandon this project.' `And for what other?' demanded Hugh, with deep interest. `I begin to fear that we may fail, after all.' `No, do not doubt! My next plan thought of, was to obtain the keys, and so penetrate to the cell, and release him.' `This will be impossible. Since you have abandoned the project which I depended on, of getting a file to him by which he could open his window, I begin to tremble!' `Yet this last plan, if we had proper assistance, is feasible. There is an office which opens to the street, where the keeper is usually seated, reading or writing, and to which every body has access. When I looked in, I noticed that the door which led to the galleries on which the cells were, was open. He was seated in it, reading a newspaper, with his foot against the post. I could see over his head, into the very heart of the prison-court, and got a glimpse of the galleries that run around the lockups. Upon a nail, within reach of his hand, was a large ring of keys, and two enormous single keys, bright with use. I knew that these were the keys which could open a way to your father's cell.' `He was alone! alone say you?' cried Hugh, `Then I see how it can be done. If all other means fail, I will have those keys if I have to grapple with the keeper for their possession.' `There is no need to risk everything so rashly,' answered his friend, quietly. `While I was looking in, a young woman, who was passing with strawberries in a basket, stopped and asked him if he would buy any. He laid the paper on his knee, and said to her— “`Come in, and let me see them.” “`I'm afeared to go in a jail,” she answered timidly, drawing back. But he bade her enter, which she did do, and stood looking round her, alarmed, while he ate two or three of the strawberries, to try them. He seemed satisfied with them and with the price, and said to her— “`Take them through that door, and the women-folks will measure out what they want.” And he pointed through the open door, and along a platform that led to the domestic offices of the prison. The girl would have declined, but he bade her go as he directed, and I saw her disappear in the interior. But fearing I should attract the attention of the keeper by my inquisitiveness, though I disguised it under the appearance of looking at a pair of fine horses that stood harnessed to a dray opposite, I walked on.— But I had seen enough to satisfy my own mind that the only way to release and save your father from execution, is by possessing yourself of those keys.' `I will do it with my life!' `No—there is no need of risking your life, or, by exposing yourself to arrest, defeating the object to which you are devoting yourself. If you should fail, and be taken up, your father would, nevertheless, die!' `True—you are always cooler and calmer than I am. Let me hear what you think of doing.' `Finding some person who will be willing to play the part of a strawberry girl, and who, at the same time, will have art enough to engage the keeper's attention, while you possess yourself of the ring of keys, placing another that looks precisely like it, in its place, which I have provided at an old iron shop to-day. I am satisfied that merely to the eye, which is all we shall want, the deception will be complete.' `But, my dear Gordon, what good will the keys do, if I get them into my hands? How shall I, in open day, go unlocking the doors of the prison, till I reach my father's cell!— and how bring him forth in the face of the keeper!' `You shall hear my whole plan, and then judge. As I said, our first step will be to find some young person who will act the strawberry-girl. The one I saw yesterday was too awkward and fearful, even could she be bribed. In a word, we must have some young woman who is intelligent, courageous, and has wit enough to engage the keeper's attention; for he is a fat, jolly looking personage, and I know has an eye to a pretty face. Bella, if she would act with us, would captivate him at once.' `Dear Bella! if she would, I would hardly consent to her placing herself in such danger as detection would lead to.' `I should not fear for her. If it were I who was in prison, she would succeed in getting me at liberty, I am confident.' `Would to Heaven she would co-operate with us! Who can you get? Who do you know, that is young and pretty, and who would be able to carry out her part?' `I know no one positively, whom we could both trust, and whose sagacity we could depend upon.' `Nor do I.' But you have not told me what she is to do as a strawberry girl. How can she aid me? Am I to act a part too?' asked Hugh, a little bewildered. `Yes. You are to follow her in, dressed as a mechanic, with a box of tools in your hand, and say that you want her to take what strawberries she don't sell, to your home, for your wife. You will make some noise with the jingle of iron in your box, so as to throw the keeper off his guard, should he hear any noise you make in taking the false keys from your box and removing the real ones from the peg into it.' `Very well, so far is well; but this depends on the charms and wit of the strawberry girl to throw dirt into the keeper's eyes. It will be impossible to get such an one.' `Of that I am not so sure. But to-morrow will show!' `And you have seen none yet?' `No—I waited till you come. But I have one in my mind now, that possibly may be persuaded, if well paid, to take part with us. But this is to be yet ascertained. I have not, I confess, even seen her, and don't know that she would at all answer to carry out so bold a plan, even should she consent.' `But suppose I got possession of the keys —what should I do with them? Wait till night? By that time they would be missed.' `No—you will act at once. I shall provide the strawberry girl, whoever acts this part, with a very costly bottle of perfumed ether. She shall pretend she found it, and hand it to the keeper, who, I see, has a covetous eye, and he will readily grasp it and claim it, or I am greatly mistaken. If he does not, she shall manage to make him inhale it; and I give you my word, that if he but snuff the subtle fluid once up his nostrils, he will, in a moment after, be as unconscious of terrestrial things as you could wish. It shall be her part to continue to apply it to his nose, while you are applying the keys to the wards which separate you from your father. At the door of the jail you will have a carriage in readiness into which to place him; and if your horses are fleet, you will, ere long, have your father as safe on board the shallop as we now are.' `Your plan is an excellent one, Gordon, save that it ought to be carried out at night. The jail office is never closed until nine o'clock, that I know; as, when I have visited my father, before his trial, I have staid in his cell till within a few minutes before, when the keeper would come for me, saying it was time to lock up for the night. Would it do to have a strawberry girl go about selling at night?' `No—hardly—without exciting suspicion. I have it—she shall be a flower-girl. She shall sell boquets, as I have seen the young quadroons do evenings, in New Orleans.— You are right, if it could be carried through after night; but I was not aware that the office was kept open so late.' `Yes, till the bell rings nine.' `Then it shall be done at night.' `You are sure about this ether?' `Yes, it is infalliable. All that is now wanted is some young woman who would enter fully into our plans. A young girl going in to sell flowers would excite no suspicion.' `But how will it be with me as a carpenter, with my box? One of my assumed profession would hardly want flowers for my wife.' `You could say your wife's cousin was to be married, and this would be excuse enough. This plan, on the whole, is the only one that I can frame that gives us any hope of success. It is an important one, and the favorable result will depend on many circumstances which we cannot contrive. In a great measure, we shall have to be governed by what passes at the moment, in carrying it out.' `Yes, and I am prepared to run all the risks, if possibly I might save my father from the doom that is before him. Unless this succeeds he will perish within three days on the gallows!' `Yes—to-day is Wednesday; on Friday he is to be executed.' `Say not he is to be, Gordon,' said Hugh, with a flushed cheek. `Never! never shall my father die upon a gallows, if I have to drive my knife into his heart when he is on his way to it! No, no! I have sworn that I will rescue him or die in the attempt. Who is this young woman you think can be gained over to be a party to our plan?' `It is yet doubtful—as I have never seen nor spoken with her.' `Then what grounds have you for hoping to secure her services?' `Her poverty!' `She shall be well rewarded. Is she intelligent and courageous?—has she a pretty face to ensnare the eye of the keeper, as well as wit to captivate his attention? This is all necessary, you know.' `I cannot tell. I am going to see her early to-morrow morning. I will tell you all I know about her. While I was waiting for you upon the pier, walking up and down, and almost given up the hopes of seeing you approaching, I saw a man standing near me, who seemed to be watching my movements; for, on discovering that I saw him, he started to fly up the wharf. Fearing he might be a spy, sent by some one who might suspect my purposes. I sprang forward and seized him. He proved to be a negro, and I found that his business there was to ascertain if the old house at the end of the wharf, had suffered by the storm,—there living in it, as he said, an old, crippled sea-captain and his daughter. He said he had once sailed with the captain as steward, and been wrecked with him four or five years ago. The captain had his leg broke at the time of the wreck, and the negro saved his life. It would appear that the owners accused the captain of neglect of duty, and refused to give him another vessel— which preyed so upon his health and spirits that he has never yet perfectly recovered the use of his limbs; and, in the meanwhile, neglected and forgotten by the world, he has been reduced to poverty, lives in that old wreck, the Ridgely House, I suppose rent free, and is supported by his daughter, a young girl of eighteen.' `This you learned from the negro.' `Yes; and he gave me their history so feelingly that I was deeply moved by it.— Moreover, he showed his goodness of heart and their exceeding poverty, by saying that he was looking for a vessel to go to sea in, that he might get his month's advance and make a present of it to Missy Jenny, as he called the young girl, to buy a bonnet and dresses! I liked the negro so well that I engaged him at once for you, and to-morrow at eight he is to meet me at the Two Anchors. He is honest and daring, and he will evidently make you a valuable hand.' `This young person can be gained over if money has any power over poverty,' said Hugh. `I hope that she can and—' `I mean to go and see her in the morning in company with the negro Cæsar, who seems to have taken upon himself to be their protector.' `Is Cæsar the name of the black?' `Yes.' `I once saved a young fellow of that name from a shark in Havana, as our frigate lay there,' said Hugh. `But, as half the negroes are Cæsars, it is little likely to be he. But, should it be, he will be of great value to us, as we can trust him fully. But it is not likely at all that it is he. Now, as all depends, if we hold to this plan, upon securing the services of this captain's daughter, I hope you will prevail upon her.' `I hope so. But there is one young girl, if I knew where to find her, whom I could induce to enter heart and hand, into our plot,' said Gordon, with confidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. `Love to be proven needeth not speech. The eyes' rich eloquence mocketh at words.' Hugh Ogilvie fixed his eyes with curiosity and interest upon the face of his friend, as he uttered with animation and heightened color, the words with which we have closed the preceding chapter. There was in the tones and cadence of his voice, as well as in the slightly embarrassed air of his countenance something that seemed to Ogilvie mysterious. `Who is the person you speak of with such blushing confession, Gordon?' he asked with a smile. `Are you in love, too? You certainly look as if you were. Whoever the fair maiden is you alluded to, I am certain she has taken your heart captive. If so, I trust your love will be requited, and that you will fare better than I.' These last words were spoken with a faltering voice, as if some deep disappointment continually weighed upon his heart. `I hardly know whether I shall be better or worse off,' answered Gordon, looking, with a conscious smile upon his lips at his friend. `As I have betrayed my secret by my manner, you shall know all, at least as much as I know. You have guessed truly. I am in love.' `With whom?' cried Hugh, bending eagerly forward over the table. `I knew it. Who is it?' `That is a question easier asked than answered,' responded Gordon. `I should like to know myself.' `In love, and don't know with whom? Have you never seen her even? Is it a description of some one, or a picture you have fallen in love with?' asked Hugh with surprise, and the more as the sadness expressed in Gordon's face, showed that his heart was in truth no longer in his own possession. `As I said, you shall know all about it. It is a little love-passage, but one that has left behind it an impression upon my very being, that no time can eradicate.' `You know, Ogilvie,' began his friend, `that when the corvette to which I was attached left the Mediterranean while your frigate took our place there, she came into the port of Boston?' `Yes, instead of Norfolk; and all in your favor, too, as you resided here,' answered Hugh. `When I came home, two months ago, I had to travel all the way from Norfolk here. And you may be assured I made speed, for Bella was the star before me. Little did I imagine when I reached Boston, that I should find her an icicle. But go on. I can't bear to talk of her, yet how can I help it, when she is always in my thoughts. If you are in love, I shall pity you.' `You shall learn whether I deserve your pity or not. After I had been at my father's in Summer street, about a fortnight, one morning as I was idly looking out of my open window smoking a cigar, and wondering what every body was in such a hurry and flurry about in the streets, when my attention was drawn to a poor foreigner who was seated upon the steps of the octagonal church. He had a monkey confined by a string to his waist, and was letting it amuse itself by running up the column. The man was full sixty years of age, with a finely shaped Roman head, grey as silver, and manly, but melancholy features. Moreover, he had but one arm, the other being a mere stump, projecting a few inches from the shoulder. Besides the monkey, there was on the steps by his side a small mahogany camera obscura. I at once saw in him one of those Italian exiles who wander in such numbers over this country. Several boys had gathered about the monkey, with the antics of which I, having nothing else to do, was much entertained, when I saw one of the boys slyly sever the string with a knife. In a moment, rejoicing in his freedom, the monkey ascended the column like a squirrel, and perching himself upon the capital, began to chatter in great glee. `The poor exile no sooner heard him above him, than he uttered a cry of fear, and looked helplessly upward; but he could not see him, for I saw that he was blind. I at once felt my sympathy and pity awakened in his behalf, and had made a movement to rise and go to his assistance, and aid him in recovering his monkey at which the heartless boys were throwing stones. But I was arrested in my benevolent intention by the sight of a young girl dressed in a plain calico gown, that fitted her small, round waist like a glove, and in a straw hat and green veil, who, passing and seeing the distress of the poor man, stopped, and bending towards him her graceful neck, said something. The words were few, but I knew were full of hope, for a grateful smile lighted up his face the moment before so stamped with despair. `She then looked earnestly up to the top of the column where the monkey was. I saw her face perfectly. It was lovely beyond all other female countenances I ever beheld. Her large, up-turned blue eyes full of benevolent earnestness, betrayed a soul of purity, truth and goodness. I forgot the exile, the monkey, the boys, every thing but that sweet face. She seemed to take such an interest in the fate of the poor man's monkey, as if she had no other thought or duty but just that present one to get his monkey back for him, and make him happy. But when she saw how high up the mischievous animal was, she shook her head, as much as to say, “`I can't get him down from there, that is very certain.” `I now waited to see what she would do The boys still kept throwing at the runaway, and she went to them, and said with a smile, “`You are too humane, my good boys, to add to this poor man's distress at the loss of his monkey, to try do it an injury also. See! it is coming down, hearing its master's voice. Let it descend, and if it should run away, I will give a quarter of a dollar to the one who catches it.” `She had hardly got the musically spoken words out of her pretty mouth, before Jocko who had been cautiously descending, while she engaged their attention, leaped to the ground, and came bounding at enormous leaps across the street and lighted upon the iron railing directly beneath my window. The boys pursued, but also threw stones. My dog Borneo who was reposing upon the steps no sooner saw Jocko perched upon the fence and making mouths and chattering at him, than he roused himself, shook his shaggy mane and made a leap for him. It was too successful. Before I could speak to prevent it, I saw Jocko struggling and shrieking in the dog's mouth. I was in the second story window, or I would have sprung out; but shouting to the dog to let him go, I hastened down stairs, but not before I had seen the brave young girl bounding across the street to rescue the monkey from Borneo. I reached the street door and opened it in time only to see her take the poor animal from Borneo, upbraiding him as she did so in a spirited manner for being so naughty. The sagacious dog, who had dropped the monkey as soon as she spoke to him, slunk away conscious he had done wrong, but on seeing me coming upon the scene, he fled up the street. `The brave maiden had no sooner got the poor, frightened, bleeding animal into her hands, than without showing fear or disgust at having the custody of such a little monster, she bore him across the streets in her arms and placed it in those of its blind master. I could hear what she said. “`There, poor man, is your little monkey again. It is more frightened than hurt, the dog dropped it so quickly. Don't let it get away again. Here is one end of the string which was tied to your arm.” “All this was said with such frank, good natured simplicity, that I was charmed. “`Here is the other end of the string,', said I, for I was at her side as soon as I could cross the street; and I took up the other end of the line which she was looking for, and which was trailing from Jocko's loins, about which it was tied. `She raised her eyes with a quick glance of surprise at my face, and the deepest blush overspread her countenance as she saw me gazing upon her with an expression of admiration and kindly sympathy with her own feelings. Together, our fingers touching, we tied the two ends of the string. Again our eyes met as she modestly said, “`Thank you, sir.” `The poor man hugged and embraced and kissed his monkey with such joy, and poured forth his gratitude to her in such broken sentences of happiness, that I could see that tears were trembling upon the long fringes of her eyelids. She made no reply, seemingly abashed and confused at my regards, and without lifting her sweet eyes a second time, she turned and tripped lightly on her way, carrying my heart with her.' `I did not know you were so susceptible, Gordon,' said Hugh, smiling. `She was, I dare say, a right noble-hearted girl, whoevershe was. Her conduct towards the poor Italian showed this. I don't wonder you were interested in her. Did you never learn who she was?' `No,' sighed Gordon. `And have you not seen her since?' `Yes; about three months ago. I was walking home from the navy yard, and about twilight was crossing the bridge, when I saw before me two young men who were stopping the foot-way, and preventing a female from passing. As she returned to go back in order to avoid them, one of them got the other side of her, and as I came up, she was hemmed in between the two, who were laughing at her alarm. Seeing me, she cried with a trembling voice, “`Sir will you protect me?” `I instantly recognized the voice and features of the young girl I had not ceased to think of since I saw her rescue the poor Italian's monkey for him. I sprang forward and catching one of the fellows by the collar, drew him violently backward, and held him while she passed. The other made at him, and would have hit me a heavy blow, but for my skilfulness in evading it. In an instant, I had them both upon me; and, as they were heavy, stout fellows, and used their fists to some purpose, they would have overcome me if I had not thought of my dirk, which I drew upon them. The cowards instantly fled. I then looked round for the young girl, but could no where see her. As she had passed me while I was holding the young man, she had said, gratefully, “Thank you, sir,” and hurried on.' `Do you think she recognized you to be the same beau cavalier who had assisted her in tying the monkey to the poor man's wrist?' asked Hugh, playfully. `I thought she took me for a perfect stranger—but it seems she did recognize me, and as she passed the toll-house, she had earnestly implored the toll-keeper and two men standing there, to go to the assistance of a gentleman who was assaulted on the bridge by two ruffians. This I learned before reaching the toll-house, where the two men met me. I hurried on, hoping to find her at the toll house. My foot struck against something, and on picking it up, I found it was a small morocco case, containing a pair of scissors, needles and thread, and a sixpence in money. I hastened on to overtake her, supposing she had dropped it in her haste to get some one to come to my aid. At the toll-gate the keeper could only tell me that a very pretty lass, as he called her, had told him in great alarm that an officer was defending himself against two men whom he had found annoying her, and begged him to send to his aid. She lingered, he said, till she saw the ruffians run after I drew my dirk, and then hastened on her way into the city. “`Do you know who she is?” I asked of the toll-man. “`No,” said he “but I rather think she is some sewing-girl, as she often crosses the bridge with bundles, of a Saturday night, as if she was taking work home.”' `A sewing-girl! So you are in love with some fair apprentice, Gordon,' said Hugh, smiling. `This was only a conjecture of the toll-man's. But, to tell you the truth, I had anticipated his-opinion. There was ssmething about her that made me suspect that she was a needle-girl; and I was almost confirmed in my opinion when I picked up the scissorcase.' `Of course, then, your love-dream vanished?' `Not so—my interest in her was only increased. The thought that one so young and lovely, so modest and lady-like, and, withal, so noble-hearted, should be doomed to a life of toil for support, deeply affected me. I resolved more firmly than ever to learn who she was and know her condition. Her beauty, and her noble conduct to the Italian, had awakened in my bosom mingled love and admiration—and, to tell you the truth, I believe I felt more gratification in cherishing the idea that she was a sewing-girl, than I would have felt had I known she was an heiress. I felt that I could serve her if she were poor and friendless, and love seeks to do good to its object.' `And did you see her afterwards?' `I will tell you. Three weeks ago, while I was walking through Washington street with Bella, I saw her approaching and carrying a bundle, and dressed in the same simple straw hat, and a blue calico frock fitting her fine figure with a neatness hardly seen in more fashionable and costly dresses. Our eyes met. To me, it was like an electric shock. Her face beautifully crimsoned, and she looked down and dropped, in her confusion, the bundle she carried. It fell at my feet. I picked it up, and handed it to her. She raised her eyes to mine, thanked me in tones that thrilled to my very soul. The next moment she had disappeared, lost in the crowd. I stood unconsciously looking after her retiring figure, and forgetting Bella, and all but my beautiful unknown, I was starting to follow her, when I was recalled by Bella's voice, who said, “`Are you losing your senses, Gordon? One would think that pretty apprentice girl had carried your heart off in her bundle.” `This was said laughingly and with a witty raillery that vexed me. I walked on with Bella, but with a feeling of disappointment that I had not been alone, that I might have followed her. Yet there was a feeling of deep joy in my heart to know that she had not forgotten me.' `How did she show that she recognized you?' asked Hugh. `By her looks. There was no mistaking the expression of her eyes as we met, which beamed with a look something between gratitude and pleasure. Besides, I saw her glance at Bella, and quicker than lightning there passed a change over her face, that was not exactly jealousy, but betraying a feeling akin to it.' `Well, upon my word, Gordon, you have a cool confidence in your captivating powers that is admirable,' said Hugh laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. `There is no book of rule and precept To teach young hearts love's mystery.' `Perhaps,' answered Gordon to the raillery of his friend, touching his confidence that he lived in the memory of the fair stranger, `perhaps, if I had not seen her again, and been confirmed in my confidence, I might have had doubts.' `And did you see her again?' `Yes, and for the last time. It was the same day. After I had reached home with Bella, I excused myself from tea, and walked up the street, with an indefinable hope that I should meet the lovely girl who was now filling all my thoughts. It was about half an hour before sundown. She was going up Washington street when I met her; and having made up my mind that she resided in the vicinity of Charlestown bridge, I turned my steps slowly in that direction, hoping she would overtake me on her return, or that when I should reach the bridge and retrace my steps, I should meet her going homeward. You can see from this how deeply she interested me, my dear Ogilvie.' `I am wondering at you—you, usually so grave and quiet, and hitherto so unimpressable by female chrams. To be captivated at last by a young sewing-girl, of whose name and residence you are ignorant. It is time to marvel.' `I am not certain she is a sewing-girl. But if she should prove to be it will make no difference with the interest I feel in her, but rather increase it.' `And pray when did this mysterious beauty appear again?' `You may smile as freely as you choose, Hugh. If you should ever see her you will not wonder at me.' `I hope I shall see her by all means.' `I had reached the bridge and was returning, fearing I had taken the walk in vain, when as I was crossing Hanover street, near Union, I beheld her going down the opposite side. Although I was looking for her, I was so overcome with surprise and joy that I was for a moment immovable. She was tripping along with a graceful, buoyant step, her green veil half drawn over her face, and looking neither to the right nor the left. She did not see me; and collecting my senses I crossed over, and followed her, intending to give her the case I had found, thus making it an excuse for addressing her. I was afraid she would turn and discover me, and take alarm; but she did not look behind, and each moment I drew nigher to her. Suddenly she stepped into a milliner's shop. The next moment I was in front of it. I saw her standing at the counter, and no one behind it but an old deaf woman, for the young girl had to raise her voice an octave to make her hear. `Now or never,' said I, and plucking up courage I went into the little shop. She heard my step, turned, and seeing me looked surprised, deeply colored, and dropped her veil; but I could see that her hands, in which she was holding a piece of muslin she had taken up, slightly trembled. I feared I had alarmed, perhaps offended her. Her manner indicated fear and embarassment. But I resolved I would not give any unfavorable impressions to get place in her thoughts, and I advanced, and said respectfully: “`Pardon me, Miss, but I believe you are the owner of this case.”' And the little morroco case, which was ready in my hand, I extended towards her. `As I spoke, her side face was towards me, and her veil hid her profile. But hearing my voice she turned, and as I concluded she put back her veil, and revealed the sweet countenance that for months had been mingled in my dreams, and woven into all my waking thoughts. The eye looked gentle and kind, and although there was an air of timidity in her manner she smiled, and said in the most charming way: “`You are very kind to take so much trouble, sir, to keep this so long for me, if you found it on the bridge. I am very glad to get it again, sir, although it is of no value. But it was my mother's.” These last words were spoken with a touching sadness that made me love her still more. `I answered her, though I know I was confused, and spoke awkwardly, that I had found it on the bridge three weeks before, and that I had sought an opportunity to restore it to her. “`And I am glad, sir,” she said, “that I have an opportunity of thanking you for your courage and kindness exerted in my behalf. In another moment, sir, I should have sprung over the balustrade into the river. I have not thought of your service without gratitude and a desire to see you and thank you. I did not leave the bridge, sir, till I sent two men to your aid, but I saw you put the ruffians to flight ere the men reached you..” “`I know that you did not show indifference to my fate,” I answered, “but I could not hope that you would now recognize me.” “`Yes sir,” she responded, dropping her eyes to the floor, and drumming upon it with the tip of her small foot. “I had also seen you before, though of course you do not remember the time,” and she raised her fine eyes, and bent them upon me with a look that I felt betrayed a hope that I had not forgotten. “`I shall never forget the time,” I answered with warmth. “I am happy to know that you recollect it. The remembrance of that moment has been a source of deep joy to me ever since. I have not forgotten, I shall never forget you, and to know that you have not forgotten me, inspires me with a hope that—that—” `Here I hesitated, and at length came to a full stop. Her cheeks, naturally pale, were like roses. Her young bosom heaved like an affrighted pigeon's. I stood gazing on her with happiness inconceivable. Her deep emotion betrayed the place I held in her thoughts.' `You should have said heart, Gordon,' remarked Hugh, who was listening with deep and earnest interest. `She loved you, that is clear, or she would not have shown such agitation.' `I was convinced of it. You can, the refore, form some conception of my joy at this discovery. I felt a delight not to be expressed at this assurance that she who had so long had my heart would not refuse me her own.' `For a few moments there was an embarassing, yet I am sure a happy silence, on both sides. I had said all I dared to. She knew not what to say, or how to receive my words. But I saw that she was pleased amid all her embarassment and maidenly confusion. Joy trembled on her eyelids, and gave quicker pulsations to her heart. “`Pardon me,” I said, in a low deprecating tone. “I have said too much. But if you knew, sweet girl, how I have loved to think of you—how I have striven to learn your name and abode, how I have sought for such a happy moment as this to unfold to you my heart's holy secret, you would not frown upon me.' “`I do not frown upon you, sir, she said, as if she hardly knew how to trust her voice. But she did not raise her eyelids. The color however came and went in her cheeks like summer lightning. “It is better the meeting should not have been, sir, that we should have—have—forgotten—each—each other,” she continued, with an effort that was painful to witness. “You are an officer —a gentleman—I am a poor girl. Do not think of me again. I wish we had never met. Good evening, sir. If you do regard me, respect my wishes, and speak to me no more.” `With these words, which seemed to be wrung from her heart, she dropped her veil over her face, but not before I saw sparkling tears upon her eyelashes. They eloquently told me how great had been the effort she had made to banish me from her heart; for it was plain, strange as it may appear, that we were mutually interested in each other, and had been so from our first meeting when our fingers came in contact and our eyes met as we tied the cord to the old exile's wrist.' `I was about to assure her of my devotion, and that humbleness of station would never influence me when my heart was interested; but she was already gone. The moment she had dropped her veil, and the soft mellow tones of her voice had ceased to fall on my ear, she hastened from the shop. `My first impulse was to pursue her. But I feared I should offend her, and this apprehension arrested my steps. But I determined, by following at a distance, to learn where she resided, for I had given my happiness into her keeping, and I made up my mind on the spot that if her poverty should prove the only bar to an honorable union with her, I would offer my hand as she already had possession of my heart.' `This is a romantic passion of yours, on both sides, Gordon,' said Hugh, `and what became of her?' `I stopped to ask the old woman of the shop who she was; but I had to shout so loud in her ear, that I abandoned the idea of getting information in this vociferous way; and so, giving the lovely girl, who had more and more charmed me by her propriety of behavior, as well as increased my love for her by so artlessly and frankly confessing an interest in me, giving her three or four minutes time, I left to pursue her. But she had effectually eluded my sight, and although I have been in that street and others in the vicinity every day since, I have not seen her, nor could I ascertain who she was.' `Perhaps she is an evil spirit sent to tempt you, Gordon,' said Hugh, gravely. `She is an angel rather, given to earth to bless it with her presence. She is very lovely. Her face is a faultless oval, and her brown hair is parted above her sweet brow, and is braided in a knot behind. Her compiexion is pure and warm, though pale, as if from too close confinement; for I have now no doubt that she is a needle-girl. Her mouth is very beautiful; its shape like Cupid's bow, and the full mellow lips blush like cherries. The smile that plays about it is like the light of joy beaming through. Her teeth are rows of dewy pearls, and her voice has a low, harp-like sound that one could listen to with a sense of delicious enjoyment. Her figure is slighter at the waist than Bella's but fuller at the bust, and she is perhaps half an inch under her height. And though a sewing-girl, as she may be, her hands are as small and white, and the fingers as symmetrical in their taper shape as Bella's. And her foot, though the shoe was something well worn, was gracefully moulded, narrow, arched and exquisitely diminutive.' `I see clearly enough, Gordon,' said Hugh, laughing, `I see that you are irrevocably in love. But do you, in good faith, mean to pursue this romantic passion. You, a rich, fashionable, aristocratic young man, a lieutenant in the navy, and whose attentions the proudest beauty in the land might covet; you to fall in love with a poor sewing-girl because she is pretty, and has skill in capturing runaway monkies!' `You may ridicule me as much as you please, See the maiden, and you will then envy me in the possession of so lovely a prize.' `It may be so. But while I love Bella, cruel and cold as she is, I shall envy no one another. It is this young girl, then, you think might be obtained to act the part of flower-girl in our project for my father's release?' `No, no; I have already told you that I neither know her name, nor where she resides, though it is my impression it is somewhere in the vicinity of the shop on Hanover street, where I last saw her. I merely said that if I knew where she was, and could see her, I might waken her pity for your father, as it has moved the old exile, and so get her to aid you.' `Then, pray who did you allude to? You spoke of some one. `This captain's daughter, whom black Cæsar told me lived at the end of the wharf, and who, with her father was so needy. I am going with him to see her, and try if money will not prevail upon her to consent to take part with us.' `It is all uncertain, then. I wish you could see the other one. I have no doubt she would, as she is so good hearted, aid me, if all were told her. When shall I see you?' `I will go back in your boat to the city when the sun rises, and go up to the Two Anchors to breakfast; for I told you that I took a room there, as a mate waiting for a ship. This is a convenient place to make my observations from, and to bring your father to, and conceal him, should he escape from prison, till he can embark.' `It is a wise step in you. You then will return, and I will be here to hear what you have to report. For this purpose keep the boat till you know the result, and what can be done. I shall be ready at any moment to do my part.' `Can you see the wharf from the shallop?' `No, but I can from the door of the cattle-keepers shed on the island.' `Well, be on the lookout just at dark. I'll show a light, and raise and lower it on the pier head, when you are to stand in with the shallop. Can you remain here in the cove without suspicion during the day?' `After the boat returns that takes you to town, I shall sail out and drop down to the fishing ground a mile below; and towards sunset return to this station again. I hope that you will succeed. If your plan can't be carried out, you must try another. My father must be saved at all risks, if, as I said, from the foot of the gallows.' `Nothing on my part shall be wanting, my dear Oglivie, to effect his liberation, as you well know. My friendship for you, my confidence in your father's innocence of crime-leads me to the risks I am now running. But no personal considerations shall influence me to lessen my exertions. I am in hopes I can obtain the services of this captain's daughter for money, of which I shall not be sparing. If I cannot, some other mode will be devised. I will let you know by ten o'clock what I have done. If I fail in one I will adopt another scheme. By the time you see my signal light I shall have effected something in which we can place confidence.' `I heartily trust so,' answered Hugh, as he rose up to go on deck. The storm had passed over. The stars were shining, the winds were still, and the waves settling to repose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. `The humblest servant is oft the surest.' The ensuing morning about eight o'clock a man with a patch over his eye and dressed in the ordinary costume of a ship's mate entered the tap-room of the Two Anchors, and was passing into a little passage which led up stairs, when the host called to him— `Avast, there, mate! There's been a black fellow here, who said he had engaged to ship with a mate as put up here; and as you are the only one, I told him to wait till you come in; for I said you hadn't been in since yesterday.' `Where is the man?' asked Gordon Haysturning towards the landlord who was mix, ing a can of grog behind his bar, for a knot of sailors that were seated by a low window in the corner, overlooking the water. `He said he would call again, sir! a likely fellow and make you a good hand. When do you expect your brig round from York?' `I hardly know!' evasively answered Gordon. `Well, you'll find the Two Anchors a snug sailor's home as you own cabin, so long as you stay with me; though you have not taken a meal here yet, and hardly slept here, for that matter.' `I have friends in town, and my business calls me a good deal away.' `Yes, yes! I dare say,' answered the landlord with a twinkle of the eye and a sly wink. `Young mates just in from sea generally have enough to keep them busy. But every man's business is his own. Shall I send the black fellow up to your room when he comes in?' `Yes,' answered Gordon, and left the tap to go up stairs, glad to escape further conversation with his landlord, with whom, as the reader has understood, he had only engaged a room temporarily in order to aid him in his plans. He had reached the city at two in the morning and gone at once to his own princely residence in summer street, and after a few hours sleep he had left for the inn to meet the negro Cæsar. The room into which he retired from the tap, was a small, dark apartment, ill-lighted by a single window which commanded not only a view of the harbor, but of the island a mile and a quarter distant where the shallop was concealed. He could also see on his right the extremity of the old wharf which we have described as the site of the house where Robert Alison and his daughter dwelt. He walked up and down the chamber deeply meditating upon his projects and devising a dozen other schemes in case the present one should fail. Suddenly he heard a step on the stairs, and a loud voice: `Go right up, man, and turn to the left-first door.' `It is the negro!' exclaimed Gordon. Now shall I soon know whether this young girl will aid us or not.' `He threw open the door and Cæsar stood before him at the head of the stair-way. `Be dat you, massa capitan?' inquired the negro, as if doubtful whether he recognized the person he had seen the preceding night. `Come in, Cæsar! I have been expecting you,' said Gordon. `You have been here once before?' `Yiss, massa,' responded Cæsar, as he entered, doffing his old red cap and bowing with the excess of African politeness, `I bin here leetle bit time ago, and not findin' massa in, I takes leetle walk to see a frien' ob mine as black boots for a libin', what lib up de lane.' `Well, Cæsar, I promised to ship you last night,' said Gordon, as he carefully shut the door and placed himself in a chair by the window. `Yiss, massa! Twenty-four dollars month!' answered Cæsar grinning from ear to ear. `Twenty-four was it, I thought it-was twenty.' `Twenty-four, massa.' `Well, I agree to it! But do you know in what service you are to ship?' `I hopes berry `spectable, massa, seein as how massa look like a gemman.' answered Cæsar, with a look of slight misgiving. `What kind of service would not be respectable, Cæsar, in your notion?' asked Gordon, smiling. `Wall, massa,' responded Cæsar with a deliberatum and rolling the white of his eyes around the walls, to the ceiling and then out of the window, as if looking for something to hang his answer on, `wall, I should tink smugglin' wasn't 'spectable; nor piratin'; nor privateerin' under Captain No-man's flag.' `Very well! Then you take me for smuggler, you rascal?' said Gordon, with amazement. `Not zactly, massa, but—' `But what?' `Last night I tink dar is something 'spicious bout you, massa! But den I wants de money berry much for Missy Jenny, and so I says, I'll go and see what you be, and if it aint hangin' I'll ship.' `You are very cautious, Cæsar.' `Has to be, massa. All poor nigger hab in dis world be him caracter to support! If massa, please, I'd like to know whar your ship be, and whar she bound, and how long de voyage.' `Well, you shall know shortly. I would first inquire of you about this young girl, this captain's daughter.' `Missy Jenny, massa?' `Yes. What is her name?' `Jennette, massa.' `Jennette! And her father's?' `Alison! Missy Jennette Alison, daughter ob Cap'n Alison, massa.' `You say they are very indigent.' `Berry how much, massa?' asked Cæsar with a stare. `Very poor you say they are?' `Berry, massa! Cap'n hant yarned a dollar this three years, and his da'ter support him and hersef sewin'. Dar ant in all Bosson, massa, sich a fine young lady as Miss Jenny. She is up in de mornin' yairly to her work, and nebber goes to her bed till long arter de watchmen come on deir beat. But, massa, dere so many white women sewin' dat work berry cheap, and Miss Jenny hab work all de time hard as a nigger to get enough for both to eat and wear, and pay de rent.' `Have they no friends to assist them?' `Massa, hab a rich sister, married a lawyer, but she berry proud and turn her back on him soon as de marchant said he lost his ship by bein' careless; and when arter he got poor he sent Jenny to her, four year ago, to borrow some money, she treated the child-like a beggar's brat come to her for cold wittals. It near broke de Cap'ns heart. Wall, things got pretty bad, and when he saw Jenny getting sick for working too close, he made up his mind to call and ax an old friend who was a marchant. But de marchant sent him back such a letter he nebber hab de heart to write agen. So Jenny say she support him altogether. But poor litty lady she hab more dan she can do.' `I really pity them!' `It make me berry sorry to see em, massa, 3 when I come home from my last voyage and find em out! Cap'n berry proud, wouldn't tell poor nigger how bad off he was; but I guess it, for ebbery ting speak berry plain!—no chairs—no tables—no bed —ebbery ting berry bad, massa! So I axes Miss Jenny, and she tell Cæsar all about it! So when I hear it I berry mad at myself coz I brought home only little money, coz I had been gone four years; but nigger spend all him pay in foreign ports. But I hab sixteen dollars and try and make Miss Jenny take it; but she refuse, so I tell her it is for her father, and if she don't take it I'll throw it in de dock. So she take it and buy cheap table, chair and bed, and dat all dey hab.' `How come they so destitute?' `Landlord took ebbery ting day afore I came home, massa! Strip em complete.' `When did you give her this?' `Three weeks or four ago, massa! Now I wants to ship and give em my advance and dat'll make em lectle more comfortable, massa; and I'll leave 'structions behind, massa, to have ebbery dollar ob my month's pay paid over to Miss Jenny when I'm at sea.' `You are a noble fellow, Cæsar. There is a purse of gold, in it you will find fifty dollars! I give it to you as a bounty, not as your first month's advance; for I don't know that you will ship when you know in what craft you will go.' Cæsar's eyes opened as large as those of an ox, when he felt the undoubted weight of gold in his palm and saw it shinning yellow through the strings of the purse. He looked at the coin and then at the giver with incredulous wonder mixed with an indefinable joy. `What! Give dis gold to Cæsar as bounty! Why massa! nigger oberwhelm! Massa joke.' `No, Cæsar! I am serious. I give it to you, that you may be able to assist the persons, your friends, in whose distress you have so deeply interested me.' `But, massa—' `Well, Cæsar!' `I ant shipped yet, massa! And—' `Well, out with it! Why do you hesitate?' `Dis looks berry suspicious, master!' answered Cæsar, shaking his head, and looking side-ways at the gold. `Your first idea of my being a smuggler or pirate has come over you.' `To tell de libbin' truf, massa capitan, it hab!' answered Cæsar, with emphasis. `Well, my good fellow, you may set your mind at rest upon that subject. I am no smuggler, pirate, nor privateersman.' `Den what trade am massa's ship 'gaged in?' `Can you keep a secret, Cæsar?' `Yiss, massa!' `Will you keep the secret I am about to relate to you?' `Yiss, massa, if it don't be bout murderin' nobody.' `I applaud your caution, Cæsar. Know then that I have a young friend—who—who is in love.' `Yiss, massa! young gemmen berry often dat way.' `Well, the young lady doesn't exactly feel as he does.' `I understand, massa;' `Now, you know, Cæsar, that it is the most natural thing in the world for the young man to wish her to love him.' `Yiss, master.' `And that he should think that if she saw more of him and knew him better, she could not help loving him! Do you comprehend, Cæsar?' `Parfectly, massa! I und'stan'!' answered Cæsar, who had listened with attention, his mouth open devouring every word. `Well, the only way he can bring this about is to try and get her into his possession, that she may see what a noble young man he is and how worthy of her love on better acquaintance.' `Yiss, massa!' nodded Cæsar. `Therefore it would be the most natural thing in the world for him to get a small vessel, say the shallop you saw me get on board of last night, and come to Boston after her and try and get her on board that he may run away with her.' `Berry nat'ral, massa, berry much so. Now I begins to onderstand 'bout de shallop dat make me so 'spicious ob you, massa! Dat was de young gemman's den?' `It was the young gentleman's shallop. He is waiting down the harbor to day for his passenger. He wants another hand to help him work his craft, in addition to the man and two boys he has. It is for his service I would ship you. It is uncertain how long you may be wanted; but not more than a month or two. If you are faithful, however, you shall always find in both him and myself a fast friend.' `And when does de young massa expec' to run away wid de young missis?' `Perhaps to-night. Will you take part with us? That fifty is but a trifle of what you will be paid.' `Yiss, massa! Cæsar will do just as you say.' `Then, perhaps, I may further trust you!' added Gordon to himself, as he paced up and down the room with a thoughtful air, while Cæsar, all his suspicions removed, was delightedly counting over the purse of gold. `Indeed I shall have to trust him instead of deceiving him, as I have just done, if I expect the co-operation of this young girl, who will doubtless be more influence by what he will say, than by anything I can urge. I see that I must make a full confidant of him as well as her, perilous though it will be, if I would enlist her. He is an honest fellow and I may be able to awaken his sympathies. I will not garble the matter! He shall know all, keeping what he has! Cæsar!' `What, massa.' `I have not told you all! I am afraid to trust you.' `I'll be true, massa.' `Do you believe in God?' `Sartain, massa! How can nigger ebber be libbin without dar be God?' `Well, swear to me and say that you hope He will never have mercy on you, if you reveal the secret I am about to tell you.' `I swear it, massa capitan!' answered Cæsar whose heart the shining gold had wholly won. `Then listen! The object which brings the shallop here, is not altogether what I have stated; indeed we will not think of that.' `No, massa.' `The captain of that shallop is a young seaman—a man beloved by me, for we have sailed together. His father lies in prison under sentence of death. The crime he committed was stopping the mail, not to rob it, for he was rich and respectable, but in order to obtain possession of a letter in the bags which involved the estate and character of one very dear to him. He was so unfortunate as to wound the mail-carrier, though he obtained the letter he wished so much for. The mail-carrier died, I am sorry to say, and the gentleman was arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to die. His son you saw in the shallop last night. He is waiting to effect his father's release to-night or to-morrow and convey him away by water to a place of safety. I know you are too good-hearted to refuse your aid in this case. His father intended no crime, but only to save a family from ruin. In the attempt to save others he ruin himself. Will you give his son your aid in sailing the shallop, should he be so fortunate as to get his father safely on board?' `Yiss, massa.' `You shall have gold uncounted! May I trust you now further?' `Whatebber massa please! I berry grad I can do something for de poor gemman.' `I have then, one more thing to propose to you, Cæsar;' said Gordon with peculiar emphasis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX: `It is better to give than to receive.' `And what is um massa perpose?' said Cæsar, after Gordon had spoken, seeing that he remained silent and undecided whether to speak further or not. `I ready to do any ting for you, massa, coz I knows you be a berry nice gemman.' `Well, Cæsar, what I have to propose is this: `Before we can succeed in getting the father of my friend from prison some stratagem must be resorted to; do you understand what I mean by stratagem?' `Oh, yes massa. It am—am—am—it am a sort ob a cheat! dust in um eye!' `You have it, Cæsar. The keeper of the jail must have dust thrown in his eyes.' `Yah! yah! yiss, massa. I see 'em now. But who hab you for frow de dust—make the stratagery?' asked Cæsar, with great interest. `My plan is this: The jail has an office on the street which is kept open until nine o'clock, and the keeper usually is found there, with the inner door to the prison open. Over this door hangs the prison keys.' `Yiss, massa, I sees 'em now.' `You do, hey?' `I means in de maginashum, massa.' `I have obtained a bunch of keys precisely like those in size and shape. Now if we could get possession of those keys we should be able to effect our purpose if other things favor us.' `'Spose Cæsar go in and knock de keeper down and snatch de keys, massa?' `You are a faithful fellow, Cæsar. But that would not do. There must be no violence used; and besides, violence would defeat our object. What would you do with the keys after you had knocked the keeper down and seized upon them?' `Go in and unlock old massa's cell and let him out.' `And in the meanwhile be locked up yourself. You could not knock him down in an open office on the street without peril. You would be seen. Some other way I have hit upon; one far more quiet, and likely to succeed.' `Wat dat, massa? I see dat it wont do to knock um down.' `No, I have thought if I could find some young woman who would consent to act the part of a strawberry or flower girl and go in and offer the contents of her basket for sale, she might manage to let him smell of a bottle which I have also prepared, of which if a man smell but once he shall become insensible the next moment.' `Dat berry nice, massa. Dat better dan knock um down. It make no noise.' `Yes; but the difficulty remains as to obtaining such a person. I want a young woman who will not be rudely driven away by the keeper; for she must succeed in holding him in conversation. Do you know, Cæsar, of any one who, for fifty dollars, would take this part, and whom we could safely trust?' The negro started, as if with a pleasurable idea, then seemed to hesitate, and shook his head. `I did tink ob de captain's daughter, Miss Jenny; but I'd rather she no put herself in such danger, massa. It nebber do. If she be taken up they hang her. No, no massa, not her. Somebody else.' `I know of nobody else, Cæsar. Think of the fifty dollars I offer her. Think of her destitution. She would hardly thank you for refusing her such an offer. Besides there is no danger. Who will ever suspect her, though we should fail, of having had anything to do with it?' `Dat berry true, massa,' answered Cæsar, thoughtfully. `If she will go, she be berry best person you can get, massa.' `Will you go with me to see her, that I may ask her? Perhaps when I see her I may not be satisfied that it will be safe to trust her; for we must have one who is sensible, courageous, quick of wit, and self-possessed, as well as sufficiently interesting in her appearance to attract the eye of the keeper and induce him to gossip with her.' `Miss Jenny all dat. But, massa, `de captain may not like to hab her go.' `I can but try, Cæsar. You must not betray me, now, for I am going with you as a common sailor, and you must pass me for one of your shipmates.' As Gordon spoke, he went into a closet, and took from a trunk an ordinary suit of seamen's clothes, jacket and duck trowsers well tarred, and, removing his pea jacket, drew them on over his uniform. He also added a huge pair of false whiskers and settled the patch over his eye more securely. With his tarpaulin cocked to one side, he re-appeared before Cæsar, so metamorphosed that the surprised black started back, exclaiming: `Bress my soul, dat ont you sure enuff, Massa mate?' `Yes,' answered Gordon, `it is me, Cæsar. I go in this disguise that I may not be recognized by the captain, should he have ever seen me, or that should my errand fail, I may not be afterwards recognized. It becomes me to be safe in every movement I make.' `Yiss, massa mate,' answered Cæsar, grinning as he surveyed him from head to foot `sure enuff, you look just like one ob my shipmates. I nebber 'spect you was ebber mate ob a ship.' Gordon secretly smiled as he imagined what Cæsar's surprise would be did he know that he was an officer of the navy, and that his mate's costume was only a disguise. `Come, Caesar, let us go; we have but little time to spare.' They passed down stairs together, and walked out through the crowd of tars in the tap-room unnoticed, so many were constantly coming and going at the Two Anchors. On reaching the street, Cæsar took the lead, and soon conducted Gordon to the end of the pier where Robert Alison dwelt. It was about nine o'clock in the morning when they reached the sunken doorway, The shutters of the corner room were opened to the fresh air that blew from the water, and on the window Gordon noticed a little geranium. `She has-taste; she is good hearted and kind, for she loves flowers,' he said, half aloud. `Are you ready, massa mate?' asked Cæsar, as he laid his hand upon the latch. `You forget; you must call me shipmate, or Jack,' warned Gordon in a low tone. `Knock, and let us go in. You can say you merely brought me with you to have a chat with the captain, and then leave all to me.' `Yes, mas—I mean shipmate,' said Cæsar correcting his error, and then opening the outer door, which led into a dilapidated entry, Upon the left was a door at which he tapped lightly. `Come in,' called a man's voice in rather feeble and husky tones. Cæsar opened the door and entered the room which we described in the scenes of the evening before. Robert Alison was seated facing the entrance, with his broken leg supported on an old box. He was smoking, his only luxury, to pay for which he had of late made little paper boxes, and sold them to a match seller for a penny the half dozen, upon seeing who it was that opened the door he half rose, his face beamed, and with a smile, and in grateful tones he cried: `How do you do, Cæsar? You never forget to come and see your old captain, if he is keeled up, and condemned as unseaworthy. I have at least one friend left, and there is my hand, Cæsar, for though your skin is black, your soul is as white as an angel's.' `I hopes I sees you well, massa captain,' said Cæsar, as he respectfully shook the captain by the hand, at the same time uncovering his head to him. `Tolerably, and better by twenty degrees for seeing you. But who have you astern here with you?' asked Capt. Alison, catching sight of Gordon, who had stopped to arrange his huge false whiskers and cover his eye, for he felt that it would be imprudent to expose himself to any subsequent recognition if his plan, after being proposed to the captain, should be disapproved of. `This is a shipmate, captain; I thought I'd bring him along to see you.' `Glad you did. Have a chair my lad, though I have only one to offer you. Cæsar, you take a seat on this box here, but be careful of my foot.' `Don't your leg get any better, massa?' `No, not that I see. There is that same issue running, and keeps me down. I never expect to be any better, Cæsar, till I'm laid in my grave. The world and I have parted hawsers, Cæsar, and the sooner I am sewed up in my hammock the better.' `Shouldn't talk so, massa cap'n. You should keep fair weather abeam for Miss Jenny's sake.' `I'd do anything for that dear child's sake, Cæsar. But I don't, when I can help it, let her hear me talk so desponding. She's now gone up town.' `I berry sorry; I want to see her, coz I got someting make her berry happy, massa. When she come back?' `Soon; she has gone to take home some shirts she has made, and get more work. More and more work it is for the poor child every day. But I do wrong to complain so before a stranger. Are you long from sea, my man?' he asked, turning to Gordon, who had been gazing from the fine looking old seaman round upon his wretched quarters with the deepest commisseration and interest in him and his unknown child. He thought, too, that he recognized the features, pale and thin though they were, and evidently much altered from their healthy aspect; and as the captain spoke, he was endeavoring to recollect where he could have seen him. `A few weeks, sir,' he answered, respectfully touching the front of his tarpaulin, which he did not wish to remove as it aided his disguise. `What ship?' `The Macedonian.' `That is a frigate.' `Merchantmen is sometimes named it, massa,' answered-Cæsar, who wondered his ship-mate should have given such a name, when it was evident from his dress that he was a fore-mast man of a merchant ship. `Have you been long lame, sir?' asked Gordon, resolved in his turn to become questioner as the safest course. `Going on five years,' answered Robert Alison, with a heavy sigh. I thought you had told him all about me, Cæsar, by bringing him,' he added impatiently, as if he did not wish to refer to the past. `Yiss, massa, and see what he has make you a present of. He gave me dis to gib you, soon as he hear 'bout you and Miss Jenny.' And Cæsar took the purse from his pocket and poured the gold out of it into the captain's mechanically. `How's this? Where did this come from?' he cried, trembling with joy and doubt, and looking first at the gold, then at Cæsar, and then in the face of Gordon. `This gold is not for me.' `Every dollar and dime of it, massa,' answered Cæsar resolutely, at the same time tossing the empty purse back to Gordon, `It all for you and Miss Jenny. I was gwine to keep it till she comed in, and see her eyes sparkle as I guv it to her; but seein' as how you didn't like my shipmate's question, and afeard you'd not like him from the first, I outs wid it. So you see he your true frind, massa cap'n.' `But, but—I—I can't receive this money. It's all the generous fellow's wages. No, no. You must give it back to him, Cæsar. Here, take it my noble man. God bless you! but I can't rob you, poor as I am; I can't make you poor even to lighten my child's toil. The rich can give, but this is at least a half year's savings of your toil. Keep it my man, and God will reward you as much as if I had accepted it.' `It is not mine to receive back, sir,' answered Gordon, deeply affected by his nobleness of mind, `I gave it to Cæsar to do with what he pleased.' `And Cæsar gib it to massa Robert,' answered the smiling negro, as he pushed the captain's hand back, and forcibly closed the fingers over the gold. `It is not yours to gib back to me, for Missy Jenny's share is in it. `Then for Jenny's sake I will keep it, since I must, my kindest friends,' answered the captain, while the tears ran like great rain-drops from his eyes. `But I hope that I am not taking what you can't spare, my dear sir,' he said, surveying Gordon closely, as if to judge whether he were a man likely to be able to give so much away; for he had no doubt that honest Cæsar's account of his and his daughter's condition had opened the seaman's heart to give without consulting his head. `I have enough more, captain,' answered Gordon, as he drew from a pocket a handful of guineas. `Your gold has been given where God's blessing will go with it,' said the captain, with emotion. `I do not hope to be able to return it—' `Do not speak of it. I am able to bestow it, sir,' answered Gordon. `I sincerely sympathize with you in your misfortunes, and having heard all your history, I for one acquit you of all negligence in losing your ship.' `You do?' cried the captain, with brightening looks. `I do, sir; for when I came into port last we made the light, and then afterwards lost it in a fog precisely as you did; and our ship came near being lost, for we stood on, trusting to the bearings of the light where we last, saw it, and all at once we heard a trumpet hailing, as it seemed, from the clouds, and looking up we saw the light over our fore-top-gallant yard, looming faintly down upon us through the fog, while from the light-house tower the keeper, who saw us first, was shouting the alarm. We just succeeded and no more in putting the ship about and saving her. Another moment and we should have gone ashore,' `I am glad to hear that!' exclaimed the captain, half rising and slapping his hands together. `That is enough to make me ten years younger.' `When I tell you that it was a frigate that got into this scrape, and that the captain was not censured, it will be more gratifying to you. If she had been lost the captain would not have been blamed.' `I wish my owner knew this, if only to do me justice.' `It was in the papers. They have no doubt seen the account.' `I know nothing of it. I am too poor to buy a paper. But if they had seen it they should have let me known that they did not blame me so much. But I suppose I am quite forgotten. But this news makes me almost as happy as the gold. And I can hardly realize that this money is mine,' he said, gazing upon it with eyes filled with the hopes of better days. `Yours and Jenny's,' answered Cæsar. `Who can separate my dear child from me, Cæsar? She has shared my griefs, and she must share my joys. Our hearts are one. Hark, she is coming in at the door. I know her step in a thousand. It always goes right to my heart. She will be rejoiced to see you, Cæsar, and then to know what a gift I have for her,' and again the old captain's eyes overrun with tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. `Gold that buys the traitor, begetteth gratitude.' When the announcement of the presence of the young girl at the door, Gordon bent his eyes towards it with deep interest and the livliest curiosity to see one whom he had not only learn to form so high an opinion of, but one by whose aid he hoped to carry out his plans. He felt that a single glance would enable him to decide whether she would be fitted for an enterprize calling for so much courage and tact. The door opened and the maiden entered, and seeing Cæsar, who had gone towards the door to open it for her, she held out both hands to him while a smile of pleasure and kindness illummed her pale but beautiful countenance: `Why, Cæsar, I am so glad to see you! If I had known you were here to talk with my dear father, I should not have hurried home so! But—' Here her eyes fell on Gordon, whom she did not discover before, as he sat a little back behind the angle of the open door, and instantly she ceased speaking, and surveyed him as if surprised to see a stranger. `It is a mess-mate of Cæsar, daughter,' said the captain, `and a friend of yours and mine! Shake hands with him and welcome him. This is my daughter Jennette, my man!' Gordon was standing like a statue. Surprise, delight, amazement had seized him at the very first sight of her; for need the reader be told that he had recognized in her the beautiful unknown who had captured his heart.' He rose and involuntarily advanced a step towards her on making this delightful, wonderful discovery, but instantly recollecting himself drew back, and stood gazing upon her with emotion, he could scarcely continue. As soon as he saw her turn towards him, he dropped his eyes, lest his intense gaze should alarm her; for he knew that she could have no suspicions that she had ever before seen him under his humble and complete disguise. At the words “this is my daughter,” he bowed low and touched his tarpaulin, hardly daring to look her in the face lest he should betray himself. How his heart bounded with joy. What an unlooked for surprise. But sadness was mingled with his joy, at last discovering who the modest young stranger was, that he should find her a sufferer from want. But this feeling was quickly dissipated at the reflection that it was in his power to make her happy. What deep delight this thought gave birth to in his heart. `But at present she shall not know who I am! I will also make certain of her heart ere she knows that I am rich. She has not penetrated my disguise, and I will preserve it! How beautiful she is, and how fondly she looks upon her father, like a mother's glance bent on a suffering child! He did well in saying she was an angel! Such heavenly eyes! I knew not that she possessed such charms! But these are forgotten in my estimation, while I reflect upon her filial virtues, her noble character, her generous heart. She is indeed a treasure! What is gold, or family name which, I fear, are all my wants, what are they weighed in the scales against virtue and beauty like hers. I know I am not worthy of her; yet I shall try to win her, knowing that it shall be my life's sweet labor to render her happy.' Such were the thoughts that passed through the mind of the young man, as he stood watching her, as without noticing him farther after curtseying to him, she placed a small parcel upon the table and then removing her straw hat and shawl, sat like a child upon the box at her father's feet. The presence of Gordon, whom she supposed some humble shipmate of Cæsar's, did not embarrass her; and Gordon had an opportunity of observing her unnoticed by her. `You are glad to see Cæsar, Jennette,' said her father, `I know by your looks.' `Yes, for Cæsar is such a warm friend to you dear father.' `Not more so, Missy Jenny dan my good shipmate here,' answered Cæsar looking towards Gordon. She glanced a second time at the large-bearded sailor, as he to her appeared to be, with the patch upon his eye, and looked as if she was wondering how he should be such a friend and be wholly unknown to her. `I am glad he is a friend, Cæsar, for we have few enough.' `You will see what a large heart he has, Jennette,' said the captain, `Cæsar, here, took it into his head to tell his shipmate our story, and so the noble fellow opens his purse and heart at the same time, and gives Cæsar fifty dollars in gold as a present to you and I! See, here it is! For you must see this gold to believe there is so much in the world, poor child!' As the captain spoke he opened his hand and displayed the guineas with which it was filled. `Given to you, my dear father?' she cried, looking from the gold to the sailor, whose whole wardrobe was not worth half a guinea. `Is there not some mistake?' `Not a bit, Missy Jenny,' said Cæsar, with shining eyes, `he gib it free as water, and he hab more! So you mustn't say one word, but take it.' `But from a stranger!' she said shrinking like a delicate mind from obligations so vast to one unknown. `You can't refuse it, missy, for it is as much your fader's as your own,' said Cæsar, `it will make him so much more comfortable. You can hab coffee and tea, and meat, and perhaps a ride in a hack once in a while, would do de old cap'n berry great deal ob good.' `Yes, it will be indeed a blessing,' she said, half aloud. `But I can hardly realize it! Will you tell me, sir,' she said,' `why you have done this?' she asked, looking Gordon in the face with an angelic frankness. `It is not usual for men to give so much away without a motive?' Gordon was struck with her wisdom and good sense, and more than ever loved her. He feared to reply lest his voice should betray him, as he saw that she did not at all recognized his features or person. But disguising his tone he answered, as she seemed to expect a response: `I gave it that I might contribute what I had no use for, to the nncessities of virtue and filial piety. I heard your father was poor and sick, and that his child supported him by daily and nightly toil. Could I then be a sailor, whose generosity is proverbial, not to seek to relieve an old infirm captain, and make his noble child's toil lighter.' `You are a noble fellow, and a true sailor,' said the captain with grateful emotion. `And accept my thanks and my father's, sir,' said Jennette. `You have done us more service with the bestowing of this gold, than you suppose; for, my dear father, as I came down the wharf I met Mr. Grundy, the owner of these old houses, and he told me to tell you, that you must move out to-morrow, for the buildings were to be taken down at once! My heart was heavy enough when I came in thinking where we could go, knowing that nobody would rent us a room unless we paid for it in advance.' `There, sir,' cried the old captain, `you see what a good angel you are to us. But for this, I have no doubt I should be to-morrow where I have so long feared, and that is in the alms-house.' `Never, dear father, so long as I had fingers to work for you!' cried Jennette, with an earnestness, that deeply touched Gordon's heart. How he rejoiced to know that he had had it in his power to avert the evil threatened, and to make the sweet girl happy. But he could not forget his errand there. He did not forget his duty to Hugh Ogilvie. But should he think of Jennette, as party to the escape? Could he expose her to such perils, and perhaps to the impudent familiarity of the keeper's admiration? At first the idea jarred upon his feelings. Since the young girl he had sought out, proved to be his lovely unknown, he hesitated. But the more he reflected upon it, the more he was satisfied of her fitness. `I would have consented to let my sister Bella take this part, would she do it,' he said to himself, `why should I refuse to ask Jennette, though I do love her! I will no longer hesitate! Perhaps, for my sake, when I make known myself to her, she may consent. But first I will secure the father, whom I now clearly recognize, and whom I know will, when he knows who I am, do any thing for me; and Cæsar I am persuaded is the very negro I saved from the shark in Havana! Thus I have two links to bind the father and negro to me. The daughter I trust will be won by affection. But this I have to test. `You have not told me your generous shipmate's name, Cæsar'? said the captain. `Jack, massa cap'n.' `You have seen me, before, Captain Alison,' said Gordon.' `Where, my man?' `At Havana! Do you remember being arrested by the guard at the theatre, for taking the part of a young American officer who having been insulted by a Spanish Don, had struck him with the hilt of his sword!' `Yes, I recollect it well. The young officer had taken a seat just before me, when the Spaniard came in and told him to move aside, that he was a colonel and of higher rank than a middy. The officer answered that an American middy out-ranked any Spanish colonel of them all; and as he had paid for his seat he would keep it. The Spaniard then laid his hand upon the young man's shoulder when he raised his sword and struck him in the face.' `And the guard then fell upon him when you, Captain Alison, bravely took his part and aided him in fighting his way out of the theatre.' `Yes, and he fought well too. But in that tussle, I was caught and pinioned and dragged off to prison. And I thought it was all up with me then; but my brave young friend hadn't forgotten me. He went down to the quay, mustered a dozen American boats' crew waiting for their captains to go off to their vessels, and led them full sixty men in all, each armed with an oar, right through the town and reached the caliboose just as the soldiers brought me and another captain up to lock us in. The young officer gave the word charge, and the lads came on like a wave and went right over the soldiers tramping them down; and before I knew it I was free and being hurried off to the harbor. We reached the quay in safety and put off all the boats in a fleet. In the scampado from the shore I got separated from the young officer, but reached my ship in safety. I have not seen him from that day to this, and I don't know of any man I would like to see better; for he took my heart.' `What is his name?' asked Gordon, not a little gratified to find that his part in the affair had not been forgotten. `Lieutenant Hays, or Hay!' answered Captain Alison. And the other day when Jennette told me how a young naval officer on the bridge had protected her from insult, and described him to me, I half believe it might have been he; for it answered his personal appearance exactly! I wish it had been, for I would rather she would be indebted to him for a favor of that kind than any other officer; for you know these gallants think if they serve a poor girl they can be bold and presuming. But Lieutenant Hay, as every body said is the soul of honor. If there is any man I would have freely exposed my poverty to and asked aid, it is he. But my man, how did you know of these transactions in Havana? Were you there at the time?' `I was one of the party who rescued you, Captain Alison.' `Were you! Then give me your hand, and let me thank you. Better late than never! You did me good service, you and yours. I would,' he added warmly, as he held firmly Gordon's offered hand in his, `that this were your brave leader's, as well as yours! I would give much to see him and be able to thank him as I am thanking you, my brave lad.' `You can see him, sir, for I know that he is in port,' said Gordon, fixing his eyes upon the lovely countenance of Jennette, which he had joyfully seen deepen its colors, as her father alluded to the officer on the bridge and her description of him. As he now spoke saying that he was in town, he saw the rich blood mount to her face, and her eyes beam with pleasure. `Why should this be so?' he asked himself; `why this pleased agitation unless she is hoping, half-believing that the officer she has met and and the one her father speaks so highly of are one and the same.' `In town!' cried the captain, with animation. `When did you see him?' `Yesterday, sir.' `I should be happy now to see him once more.' `I will let him know it, sir.' `No, no, father!' quickly cried Jennette; and then she dropped her eyes with confusion. `You need not see him, child, if you don't like to have a young officer witness our poverty.' `Oh—that—that is not it, sir,—but—' `Well, you don't think I will ask aid of him. I am too proud for that! And has not this generous sailor rendered us above it! If you see him, my man, just hint to him I am in Boston! He can then do as he pleases.' `I will, sir,' answered Gordon, with joy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. `The memory of favors lives longer far, Than the smart of injuries.' The young naval officer's heart throbbed with hope and joy. He felt that he would have a warm advocate in the father, not only for engaging the present aid of Jennette in their plan, but in a nearer and dearer object —his own happiness. That she still remembered teaderly her interviews with him, he was satisfied from her conscious looks when her father alluded to the affair upon the bridge. `How little she suspects who is present here in the same room with her,' he said, as he gazed with deep admiration upon her intelligently beautiful face. `Alas! perhaps if she knew she would fear and fly from me.— I am safest undiscovered. Cæsar!' `Wat, massa—I means what, ship-mate!' responded Cæsar, correcting himself with a look of consternation that did not escape the observation of the captain. `Do you recollect being in Havana once, on board the sloop-of-war Saratoga?' `Bress you, yiss! How you know dat?' demanded the astonished negro. `Because, I saw you there. Do you recollect when you were ascending the side-ladder with a basket of lemons in your hand, you lost your footing, and you and lemons went into the water, the tide running out at three knot?' `Sure 'nuff! How you know dat? It am six year ago. Was you dere?' asked Cæsar, staring at Gordon with surprise. `Yes, and saw how you came near being drowned, for you couldn't swim, and, what with throwing your arms into the air, and your fear, you all but lost the number of your mess.' `Dat true 'nuff, massa! I means mess-mate. And if one midshipman hadn't jump ober de starn, neber mindin' his new blue coat and buttons, Cæsar would ha' drowned forebber. But, Missy Jenney, jist as I was disappearin' for de last time, I see him in de air comin' down head fust, and struck in de water close by me. He went under and come up feet down, and cotcht me by de chin, and tellin me keep quiet, held me up till boat come and take me out; and he wouldn't let 'em take him out till dey had pulled me in all safe. I nebber forget him. Was you dere, ship-mate?' `Yes. Did you ever learn his name?'— asked Gordon. `I dismembers as he belonged to anodder ship, and was ony visitin' ours. But I sort o' tinks it somethin' like Fodder!' `Hay, you mean,' answered Gordon, laughing, in which he was joined by Jennette and the captain. `Dat it massa, I berry sure.' `And was it young Hay, the same officer I like so much?' asked captain Alison, with surprise. `Yes, sir.' `There's the very man, then, just as I knew him,—always bold and quick to aid! When was this?' `At the same time his ship lay at Havana, when you were there, captain.' `Well, Cæsar, we both owe him one,' said the captain; and stave my timbers, Jennette, if I do not now begin to believe more strongly than ever that it was nobody else but this brave young officer who saved you from being insulted by those ruffians, especially as I know he is here. It is just like him, you see. It would be surprising, after all, if all three of us were bound to him by gratitude. If it should turn out to be he, Jennette, you would not object to seeing him?' `Indeed, father, I should rather not. He has no doubt forgotten the service he did me, and the person whom he befriended,' she answered, blushing—and, thought Gordon, looking as if it made her unhappy to allude to one whom she had made an effort to banish from her heart. He could hardly restrain the impulse to tell her at once that she was not forgotten, but, on the contrary, remembered and loved. But he feared that a premature disclosure might destroy not only his hopes with reference to Ogilvie's interests, but his own dearer ones. `I should be berry grad to see de ossifer and tell him how mush Cæsar tank him,' said the black. `When you go to tell him de captain is here, ship-mate, Cæsar be too mush happy to go wid you.' `You shall see him, Cæsar,' answered Gordon, `but I fear that when you hear he is in need of the services of such friends as you are, you may forget him.' `I would do anything to serve the noble young man,' cried the captain, warmly. `I'll do ebbery ting and any ting,' exclaimed Cæsar. `You do us wrong, sir,' said Jennette, `in supposing we would hesitate to serve one who has done us such service—that is, my father and Cæsar, for I do not know that (here she looked sweetly confused) I owe to him personally the gratitude due to the officer who was so kind as to do me the service to which my father has alluded. But I trust that he is in no difficulty in which it would be necessary for him to call for the aid of persons situated as we are?' `You shall learn his position,' answered Gordon; `but I don't know that I ought to make it known, as it is a secret involving the life and safety of others.' `By all means let us hear it, if we can do him a service!' cried the captain. `Yes, massa—I mean ship-mate,' said the unlucky and blundering Cæsar. The captain, who was not by any means deficient in discrimination, had before noticed Cæsar's often-corrected phraseology; and, as he could not but discover that the language of the supposed ship-mate was above his condition, he now looked steadily at him, as if he had begun to suspect, taking the large amount of gold he had given, and still had in his possession, that he was more than he seemed. The suspicions of Jennette were, however, awakened even before her father's, for the whiteness of his hand betrayed him: and all at once he found them both regarding him with close and inquiring looks. So soon as he saw this, he said— `Captain, if you and Cæsar will allow me to speak with you alone, I shall be able to make you acquainted with the facts touching Lieutenant Hay.' `I will leave you then, father,' said Jennettee, rising and taking her work with her, for she had already begun to sew upon a collar, giving, unconsciously, Gordon a secret opportunity of watching, though with sorrow that they should have so long been condemned to toil, the rapid and graceful motions of her fair fingers. As she spoke she left the room, and made her way up the dilapidated stairs to a deserted corner room of the old mansion, where, upon an old bench drawn to the window, she seated herself; but, instead of sewing, she gazed upon the water, and thought within herself whether the brave officer who had rescued her father and saved the life of Cæsar, were, indeed, the same whom she had thrice met. The thought that it might be made her young heart bound with hope and joy— but only the next moment to sink again, as she thought of her lowly condition, and his high position in society. `Little will it effect me,' she sighed, `whether he be proved so or not. I have done wrong to think of him so much, after having told him not to think of me. Oh! what joy filled my heart when I knew that he loved me—for I cannot now doubt, though at the moment I was alarmed and feared him, though I feared most for myself. If I had not fled from him out of the shop as I did, my poor heart would have betrayed its secret. If I had let him see how I loved him I should have been humbled in my own eyes, and perhaps in his. It was best as it was—best that he should think I thought coldly of him.— But in vain I try to forget him! His looks of tender and respectful admiration—his kindness of tone and manner! Ah, me! I shall never cease to love him—never can I forget him! I wonder who this sailor is, who seems not to be what he seems?—who gives my father gold—who knew both him and Cæsar before, and of their escapes—and yet, whom neither seem to know? And how often Cæsar addressed as master, as if he were not a ship-mate in truth, but only in guise. There is a mystery about that man, with his patched eye and his embarrassed manner. He speaks thick, like one who is watched, and fears to be heard! I wonder what he can be about to reveal, touching this Lieutenant Hay, who, he says, is in some trouble? If he is, for my father's sake I would be ready to serve him and aid him. I pray that it will not prove to be he who is in trouble,' she added with deep emotion. `How I wish yet fear I shall meet him again, every time I go out! I did violence to my own heart when I told him no more to think upon me. Yet, what could a friendless and poor girl like me do? Maidenly dignity and propriety demanded the sacrifice. But I will not think of him.' With this resolution she addressed herself to her toil with the needle; but ere she had taken seven stitches, she had paused in her task unconsciously, and her mind was again absent upon the interdicted thoughts. Tears, too, came into her eyes, and her bosom heaved as if her heart were breaking. Poor Jennettee! Thou art thinking it is a hard lot to be poor, so that thou canst not hope to be loved and honored where thou lovest so well! We will leave the lovely sewing-girl to her sweetly sad meditations, and return to the apartment where we left Gordon. `Now, Captain Alison, that we are alone,' said Gordon, after the last faint footstep of the retiring Jennette had fallen on his listening ear, `I will put an end to this seeming. I am not a sailor, though I trust I am a seaman, captain. I have come hither in this disguise, not knowing I should find friends. But I know that Lieutenant Hays can freely trust himself in the presence of Captain Alison and Cæsar.' As he spoke, he removed the patch from his eye, and showed it whole, as the other.— He then removed his huge whiskers, and laid them down, the captain surveying the proceedings with astonishment. But Cæsar was, so far, in the secret. Then taking off his loose sailor's jacket and flowing duck over-alls, he stood before them a gallant, fine-looking naval officer! `Lieutenant Hays! I need not be told who you are now!' cried the captain. `I am overjoyed! And all the while you have been disguised, and I never suspected you; though I questioned very much whether you were a common sailor. To your generosity, then, I owe this gift of gold?' `I did not know to whom I was giving it, captain. Cæsar told me of a captain who was hard used by the world, I gave it to him for you, little knowing who would be the recipient.' `Bress my soul, massa!' cried Cæsar, who at length found his tongue, and who was staring at the brilliant uniform of the officer, with his eyes wide open with surprise. `So you no mate ob ship, after all? I nebber guess you ossifer in de naby. I berry glad see you, and I takes dis opportunity to tank you for divin' ater me! I knows your face now—you jist as young as ebber. Please, massa Lieutenant, let poor Cæsar shake you hand for savin' his life' `Me too, lieutenant,' cried Captain Alison. And for a moment Gordon stood with a hand grasped by each of his grateful friends, who looked overcome with joy and gratitude. `Then all this while I have been talking to Lieutenant Hays,' said the captain, smiling through his tears. `Well, sir, you know what we think of you. This is the happiest day of my life! Now, sir, answer me one question—did you rescue a young girl who was insulted on the Charlestown bridge, three weeks ago? `I did—and, to my joyful surprise, I found this morning that that lovely person was your daughter,' said Gordon, with feeling `Then give me one more grasp of your hand, my noble friend. This is wonderful, indeed, that we are all indebted to you—two of us for our liberty and life, and my child for her safety. God bless you, Lieutenant Hays! And this gold too! Well, I am overloaded with obligations and debts to you! Heaven must repay you—I cannot!' `Do not speak of the small sum of gold.— It was fairly Cæsar's, but I knew he would give it to you, and therefore placed it in his hands, as I did; but it was ostensibly to pay him for services to be rendered to me.— Thank Cæsar, for it is his gift.' `Then God bless Cæsar also.' `Thankee, good massa Robert!' `Now, Cæsar, will you tell me how you come to bring the Lieutenant here, when it seems he did not come to see me, not knowing who lived here?' `I will tell you, captain. I feel, as I said a little while ago, that I can safely trust my life in your hands, and also the lives of those dear to me.' `That you can, sir,' answered the captain. `Now I knows who you is, massa, you can do any ting wid Cæsar—drown him agen, if you wishes to.' `I don't want to drown you, Cæsar, but I wish to have you faithful to me.' `Dat I'll be, massa. And I nebber wants no money.' `I will then say plainly, as to two tried friends, how I want you to aid me, captain; for Cæsar already knows his duty. You have heard of the arrest and conviction, as well as sentence of Colonel Ogilvie?' `Yes, I heard that he was sentenced to be hanged, and I am sorry for him. He was a noble gentleman, and once I knew him well, for he came passenger from Havana with me, some years ago.' `Better still. Then you liked him?' `Yes, I never saw a more gentlemanly and courteous man; and though we were but fourteen days on the passage, I never have ceased to remember him with respect. He made me a present of a silver mounted compass when he left the vessel here. When I heard that he had been convicted of robbing the mail and shooting the driver, I was amazed, and could hardly believe it; but a chair-maker who lived next door to me, loaned me the paper containing the trial, and so I had not a doubt! But it has always been a surprise to me. I never could understand it.— But however it was, I am sorry for him, from the bottom of my heart, poor gentleman!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. `There may be crime upon the hand, And yet the heart be innocent and free.' Gordon was overjoyed at this expression of sympathy in the captain, and felt that he could make a confidant of him without reserve. He therefore said, after looking cautiously at the door to see that it was closed, and at the windows to ascertain that there were no eaves-droppers. `Colonel Ogilvie deserves your sympathy, Captain Alison. He is an innocent man in heart, though he stands convicted of a great crime. The particulars are these; for as I need your services, or rather those of one whom you can influence, I will detail the events to you without concealment. `Colonel Ogilvie was, as you are aware, formerly a merchant of great wealth, and retired from business a few years ago highly respected by a large circle of friends. He was appointed guardian to an estate to which his nephew, one of the finest young men in the country, now twenty years of age, is heir. He had a visit from a lawyer, who was as wicked as he was shrewd, who made known to him the existence of certain papers which would go to prove the young man illegitimate, and bring dishonor upon his own sister. The lawyer promised to surrender the papers for half the young man's fortune. `This, Colonel Ogilvie indignantly refused and indeed defied the lawyer to do his worst, when he threatened to institute a suit and so make the matter public. `But on reflection, Colonel Ogilvie, who felt that publicity was half as bad as guilt, whether proved or disproved, and conscious that ill name would always attach to the young man, his nephew, as well as follow his sister's memory, he waited on the lawyer, and though conscious that the papers made up of letters and confessions &amp;c., were all ingenious fabrications, he proposed to give the villain ten thousand dollars to drop the affair, saying to him, “`I know it is money you want, and money I offer you; only let this young gentleman retain his honorable name unsuspected and unspotted. Take the money I offer you, and let him escape this vile conspiracy against his property.” `But the lawyer, who, instigated by the devil, had set this base attempt on foot in order that he might either extort money from Colonel Ogilvie, or from the young man, said that he had increased his price, and that unless he had two thirds of the estate of his ward, he should bring suit in behalf of the real heirs, to whom he had only to hint the matter, to be employed by them to prosecute; the collateral heirs being a nephew and niece of Colonel Ogilvie's sister's husband, and cousins of young Heber Deforrest, the real heir. “`Unless you make over to me a title to this amount of property,” said the lawyer with a smile of Satanic power, “I shall make an appeal to the young man's pride. He has three hundred thousand, and he would, I doubt not, rather have one hundred thousand and a fair name, than three hundred with a bastard's honors, and likely to lose even that.” `Of course, Colonel Ogilvie left him, and told him to do his worst. Still he feared. He knew this lawyer had been the attorney of one of the supposed guilty parties, and might be supposed to know and have access to the facts which he assumed so boldly, though Colonel Ogilvie had not the least doubt that they were audacious forgeries.' `Really, this is a very singular case, lieutenant,' said the captain, who listened deeply interested. `A very extraordinary one. Colonel Ogilvie had every reason to fear. Here was this old shrewd lawyer coming forward a few weeks after his brother-in-law's death, with a package of letters and other papers, and declares them to be an original private cor respondence between the widow of the deceased, twenty years before, and a certain eminent statesman, celebrated for his gallantries. These letters, the lawyer asserted, embraced a correspondence of two years standing, between the then young wife and the statesman, in which her guilt was clearly made out so that any jury on earth would declare the infant boy she gave birth to during the pendency of this correspondence, illegitimate. The lawyer said he had been appointed executor by this statesman, who had died the year before, and by this means this guilty correspondence carefully filed away with copies of his own letters, fell into his hands. Passages of some of the letters he suffered Colonel Ogilvie to look at, though he cautiously kept him from getting possession of them. And with these plausible statements, backed by the letters, he comes to Colonel Ogilvie, and threatens to make the matter public by instituting a suit, unless his silence is purchased, threatning if he failed with the guardian, he would awaken the fears of the honorable young man himself.' `Was ever such villany!' cried Captain Alison, with indignant horror; `for there can be no doubt of the forgery of the letters. What was this lawyers's name?' `Parchnip.' `I knew him well by reputation, as a great rogue. I am now convinced that he forged papers. I hope the colonel did not give him the title deeds of any part of the young man's estate, in order to save his good name, and the rest of his property.' `He could not. Still he felt that the honor of his ward, who was then at the University of New Haven, was at stake, and his peace of mind also if the old villain should apply to him. So he hardly knew what to do. He did not wish to consult with any one, for he knew how dangerous it was to speak to a second ear such a suspicion; for as soon as he had parted with the secret, it was no longer his own. As for Parchnip, he knew he would keep quiet while it was for his interest to do so. `Colonel Ogilvie walked his room all night undecided what to do. He knew the lawyer well enough to know he would do as he said. He knew that, though the papers should be proved false, half the world who heard the accusation, would not heed the disproof, and his nephew and sister, with half the world would be dishonored. He was in distress—almost mad with his agitation of mind. Suddenly he sat down and wrote for Parchnip to come and see him, and bring his papers. He resolved in his heart to get possession of them or of the man's life.' `He did right—he did right!' cried the captain. `Dat he did,' exclaimed Cæsar, who had listened with no less interest than the captain to Gordon's recital, `I hope he kill him, and hab de papers too.' `Parchnip came in high glee, confident of success. As soon as he entered, Colonel Ogilvie locked the door unseen by him. “`I thought you would think better of it, colonel,” said the lawyer, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction. “Never too late to repent.” “`Have you the papers with you, sir?” demanded the colonel in a quiet tone under which he concealed his agitation. “`Yes—never go without them. Pocket safe—strong box sometimes broke open”' answered Parchnip. “`Let me examine them,” said the colonel. `The lawyer drew from his pocket a large packet wrapped in leather, which he deliberately untied, and then was in the act of drawing forth one paper at a time, when the colonel made a grasp at it. But the wily lawyer, unfortunately was too quick for him, and held fast to it. For a few moments there was a mortal struggle, but the lawyer released himself, and unlocking the door, sprang out and escaped.' `What a pity,' exclaimed Capain Alison, warmly. `The same day, the colonel received the following note: “`Sir:—As you did not succeed in your plan to possess yourself of these important papers, I shall not again place them or myself, in your power. I shall make an appeal to the heir in person, where I shall no doubt be more successful. I leave to-night in the stage, and that you may not indulge any hope of waylaying me, to rob me, I inform you in order to show that you need not cherish the hope for a moment of possessing them, that they will go in the U. S. mail bags, directed to me at New Haven; so you see I shall have them when I reach there, without any risk of losing them on the way, through any desperate violence you and your hirelings might be tempted to use towards me if you thought they were upon my person. Parchnip.” `Such was the substance of the note which Colonel Ogilvie received You may judge what his feelings were. He saw misery and disgrace about to befall the young man Heber Deforrest, whom he greatly loved. He knew Heber's pride of character, his high sense of honor, and his profound sensitiveness He saw that he would either at once yield his fortune, if it were all demanded by the lawyer, to save his honor and pure name, or else, overcome with shame at the knowledge of his supposed degraded birth, put a period to his existence. He was overwhelmed at the consequences. He resolved that he would save his nephew at all risks. “`It is now two hours to the time of the starting of the stage,” he said to himself. “It will pass after night a deep ravine, where the horses will go slow. There I will attack it, and possess myself of the parcel at all risks. I will mask myself, and no one will know who has done the act.” `With this resolution he prepared himself to carry it through. His country residence was three miles from town. The stage road 4 skirted it. He knew well the glen through which it would pass. Providing himself with a mask and a pair of pistols, he left town at twilight, and galloped forward to the ravine. Here he posted himself, and waited for the mail. He had previously looked at the books at the stage house and seen that only two passengers were entered, Parchnip and another person unknown. At length, about an hour after he had taken up his position on the side-hill ascent from the glen, he heard the wheels of the coach, and soon afterwards saw the lamps gleaming along the road through the trees. It came down into the ravine at a fast trot, and the driver then giving the horses the reins, let them walk up the hill-side midway which Colonel Ogilvie stood. He had placed a barrier of rails across the road, which stopped the leaders, when he sprang out into the road, and leveling a pistol at the driver bade him throw him the mail. Instead of doing so, the man aimed a blow at the pistol barrel with the butt of his whip, when the weapon went off and the ball penetrated his side. He fell back upon his seat with a mingled groan and curse. Colonel Ogilvie without looking to see the effect of the shot, jumped upon the fore wheel, and grasping the mail-bag which was beneath the driver's feet dragged it to the ground, and hastened aside into the hedge. Here he cut it open, and poured the contents upon the ground. Then by the light of a dark lantern, which he brought with him for the purpose, he examined the packages, and when his eye fell on one in scribed to T. Parchnip, he uttered an exclamation of joy. Seizing it, he placed it in his coat pocket, and buttoning it safely up he felt he had been well recompensed for the risk he had run. He then replaced all the letters and parcels, and carried the mail back and placed it on the foot-board again. The driver sat there groaning and saying he was a dead man. Colonel Ogilvie's humanity overcame his fears, and he resolved to try and save the poor man's life. He removed the rails from the road, and commanding the trembling passengers within to remain quiet, getting upon the box, he held the driver on his seat with one hand, while he drove with the other to the first house. Here he called to the owner and giving the wounded man in his charge, hastened back unseen in the darkness to where he had tied his horse, which he found, and remounted. `In another hour, having stopped once to despatch a surgeon to the coachman's aid, he was in his own home in town. Locking the door, he examined the package thoroughly. He was amazed at the system of the forgery. He saw that it would have been impossible to have defeated such evidence, bearing upon its face such seeming truthfulness: and he acquitted himself of wrong in what he had done to get them into his possession, though he bitterly grieved for the poor man, who had been wounded, and whom he had only intended to intimidate.' `It was a great misfortune. Did not the lawyer make any resistance?' asked Captain Alison. `None, nor the other passenger, who was a fat country gentleman. Both were too thoroughly frightened even to put their heads out of a window for fear of a ball. Of course this stopping of the mail, connected as it was with bloodshed, produced an immense sensation. `When Parchnip found that his parcel was the only one missing, he guessed who had done the deed and openly and so boldly accused Colonel Ogilvie, saying that he saw his face, and recognized his voice, that with great reluctance the justice issued an order for his private arrest and examination; for his respectability and wealth seemed to render the idea of his robbing the mail absurd. Parchuip was present as accuser, and had his rooms searched. But the colonel had effectually destroyed the papers he had recovered. He was about to be acquitted, as nothing could be proven against him, when a stain of blood was seen upon the under part of his shirt wristband. Upon being questioned about it he could not reply, but turned pale, and was so agitated that they began to believe him guilty. `At this crisis, an officer who had been searching about, brought his hat in from the entry in which he had found a mask, which he exhibited, stained in two places with finger prints of blood where the colonel had adjusted it. This was testimony strong enough to call for his committal, and he was conveyed to prison.' `Poor man,' sighed the captain. `The result you know. He was tried, convicted of the crime of robbing the mail and killing the driver, and sentenced to die. His execution is set for the day after to-morrow,' added Gordon with emotion, as he concluded his recital.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. `There is no severing two hearts true. The invalid captain and the negro Cæsar had both listened to the narrative of Colonel Ogilvie's misfortunes and crime with the deepest attention. The old seaman's eyes often sparkled with indignation, often melted with sympathy as Gordon proceeded with the story. When he had concluded, he said in an emphatic manner: `He ought not to be hung. The world would acquit him if it knew the particulars. Why don't his friends apply to the governor for his pardon?' `I have done it, Capt. Alison. The govorner says that he pities him, but cannot extend to him clemency. He says that the world will say it is because he is rich and of respectable standing. He said the mob would destroy the prison to get at him, if they thought we would be pardoned.' `It is a pity, a great pity,' said the captain, sadly. `I wish from my heart, sir, that he could escape in some way.' `That wish, captain, is but the echo of mine and of his son's, who— `Has he a son?' `An officer in the navy. He was absent at the time of his father's arrest and trial. He is now in the city. He is my near and dear friend. My heart bleeds for him. He has resolved to rescue his father if it is in the power of mortal man to do it.' `I am glad to hear that. This is good news. But what can he do? What plan has he formed?' `May I safely trust you, Capt. Alison?' `Heart and hand; and if I can in any way aid you I will do it.' `You can, at least with your influence. Colonel Ogilvie's son and myself are combined together in the plan of achieving his escape. It was decided between us that if the governor refused to pardon him we would endeavor to effect his escape. For this purpose, Hugh, his son, provided at Marblehead, three weeks ago, a swift sailing shallop, which he has fitted up comfortably within, though on the outside it still resembles a fisher's vessel. This he has been getting ready to avail himself of should I fail in my appeal to the governor. Last night, previous being informed of my failure, he arrived here, and is now on board his shallop concealed under the island a mile and a half down the harbor; while I am here on shore to perfect a plan I have projected for rescuing the colonel from the dreadful fate that awaits him, and placing him in safety on board the shallop.' `How can I serve you or his son?' asked the captain, earnestly. `You see what I am; a poor cripple, and have no possessions but this gold, your blessed gift, and my dear daughter.' `You can serve me, if you will influence your daughter.' `In what way?' asked the captain, quickly, while an expression of mingled joy and hope lighted up his features. `In two ways,' answered Gordon, with a smile and a look of embarassment. One way in inducing her to enter into our plans, another way in inducing her to accept of my hand as she already has my heart.' `Is it possible! are you not jesting—playing with an old man's vanity? Lieutenant Hays, I owe you my life, my daughter has been protected by you in danger, and only gratitude burns in my heart towards you. Do not trifle with my feelings, sir, and cause me to fear and despise you. I am a poor man, and my child is humble like her father. She is, nevertheless, too pure to be spoken lightly of.' `Captain Alison, you misunderstand me and do me injustice. What I said I mean. My thoughts of your lovely child are most honorable. I have seen enough of her character to love her. As I have told you she already has my heart, and if you will consent that I shall address her you will render me the happiest of men.' `Can this be true? Do I hear aright? My poor child honorably loved by one so rich and eminent, and one I know to be brave and worthy God be thanked. But I seem to be in a dream.' And the old captain's eyes filled with tears. `It is no dream, sir. It is a reality.' `But where have you spoken with her and seen her to know and love her? for whoever does know her must love her.' `You shall hear, captain, and I will show you that I have seen and known enough of the beauty of her character, and goodness of heart to admire her above all other women.' Gordon then proceeded to inform the captain the circumstances as already known to the reader, under which he first met Jennette when she so benevolently assisted the poor Italian showman; and he also narrated what passed at their two subsequent meetings, and especially commented upon her desire for him never to think of her more. The happy captain listened with deep surprise and emotion at the recital. When Gordon had ended with, `so you see, my dear sir, that I shall have to ask your influence to aid me in my suit, since she so fears me,' he cried, with tearful cheeks, as he grasped the hand of Gordon: `No, no, sir, you need none of mine. She loves you as heartily as you love her.' `How do you know this?' asked Gordon, with animation. `By her manner—her words—her tears and sighs, by all of which she has for some time shown me that she had a secret at heart. But when I have asked her what was the matter she has turned it off and left me in the dark. This is it. Besure she loves you, my noble lieutenant, and that you will have no need of any of my interference. You have made me the happiest of men. I could dance for joy if it were not for my lame leg. Of all men in the world to love my daughter and ask her in marriage the man I most loved and esteemed. Let me call her and tell her her happiness.' `No, not by any means, sir,' answered Gordon, quickly. `She may take a different view of it from any that you do. I have not forgotten how firmly she bade me think of her no more,' `That was because she could not believe you were sincere and honorable. Knowing her own humbleness of station.' `It may have been so, though I fear she saw something in me repulsive.' `Not Jennette. If she doesn't confess she loves you I'll give my head for a main-truck. I'll call to her and ask her at once.' `Not for the world, captain. If I should need your influence can I depend upon it.' `How can I say anything but yes, lieutenant.' `And if I should wish her aid in the enterprise before us?' `Do you mean the plan for rescuing Colonel Ogilvie?' `Not quite so loud, captain. Yes, I may need her aid.' `In any way that she can serve you I consent if Jennette does. But you must not place the dear girl in any danger, lieutenant.' `No, sir. She is dearer to me than my own life. But I may wish her to take a part that I would give my sister if I dared trust her, but I dare not, or rather do not wish to; as she and Colonel Ogilvie's son were lovers prior to the colonel's unfortunate affair; and on that account she has refused to see him. She is a good hearted girl, but proud and sensitive; and though I have no doubt that she still secretly loves him, she will not betray it. She feels that she could never wed the son of a man condemned to the gallows, even though he be innocent of the crime. But Colonel Ogilvie actually did commit the act with which he was charged, and for which he was sentenced, though he intended no mere mail robbery.' `The law judges the fact, not the intention,' said the captain. It was an unfortunate affair. Your sister herself cannot be blamed.' `I do not censure her, much as I love young Ogilvie. But I do not wish to entrust to her a secret that she might not wish to have anything to do with.' `It would not be judicious. But how could she or my Jennette serve you?' asked Captain Alison. `In this way. The keeper is, as I have seen, a lover of strawberries, and has an eye for the pretty strawberry merchant. Two days ago, as I was walking in the vicinity of the prison gates endeavoring to study out the most plausible means of getting the colonel out of it, I noticed a young and good looking girl go into the office where the fat jolly looking keeper usually sits smoking a German pipe. The door was open upon the street, and the girl stepped timidly in, being called to by him. As he priced the strawberries he admired her eyes, and patted her on the chin with his finger as he ate the berries out of her basket. On one side of the office was an open door that led upon a balcony or gallery which communicated with the dwelling, and also by a flight of steps with the court yard of the prison. Over the door I beheld hanging a bunch of keys, which I satisfied myself were the keys of the cells, by following a prisoner who was taken from the court to the jail, and seeing him received by the keeper who took down those keys to open the inner doors.' `Now if those keys could be got hold of,' said the captain, with deep interest. `So thought I, and I at length conceived a plan which I shall try to carry into effect if I can obtain the aid of the fair Jennette. My plan is for her to represent a strawberry or flower girl and go into the office, and while she is entertaining the keeper with lively conversation, Ogilvie, in the guise of a carpenter, with a box of tools, was to step in and ask the girl to take some of the strawberries to his house. He would then watch his opportunity and knock down the keys, as if by accident, with a saw that is carried across his shoulder for that purpose. Instead of replacing the same bunch of keys he adroitly takes another in exact imitation of it, from his box of tools, and hangs it up, while he takes possession of the true keys.' `This, if well done, will be a great step, but what will you do with the keeper when you have got the keys?' `I shall give Jennette, if she will take the part of strawberry girl, a small smelling bottle which she will make a present of to the keeper, getting him to smell it. One inhalation of it will stupify his senses, and render him unconscious of what passes around him. Hugh Ogilvie, then, habited as a carpenter, will close the outer door, take the keys and penetrate to his father's cell, for having been there twice he took particular notice what keys were used by the keeper to open the doors leading to it.' `But what will become of Jennette, the strawberry girl?' asked the captain, with a look of alarm and surprise. `She will leave the office as soon as the ether takes effect, and I shall be near with a carriage to remove her at once from the scene, and bring back in safety to you.' `It is a perilous business, sir,' said the captain, shaking his head gravely. `My dear child is all to me.' `She is equally dear to me, if possible, my dear captain. There is no real danger. She will be disguised, and she will have left before it will have taken full effect, or alarm given. Nobody will ever suspect her agency. Nay, were she to remain near by on the side-walk who would ever suppose she had any act in the fainting of the keeper?' `But the keeper will be rude to her.' `No; I should be the last person to place her in the way of insult,' answered Gordon, warmly. `His office door will be open—he has a family of his own within call—and besides he is too respectable to fear that. He merely loves a pretty face, and such can tempt him to forget his keys for five minutes, aided by wit and courage.' `Well, I will say no more. But when the young man gets to his father's cell, what is he to do?' `Bring him forth, and place him upon a saddle horse, which, with another for Hugh, Cæsar here will hold in readiness for him a few yards off. A back might be followed and overtaken, but a saddle horse would be able to fly soon from the scene of danger. They will ride at once to this remote pier, where a boat will receive them, and take them on board the shallop which will at once sail for Halifax.' `This is an excellently arranged plan, my dear lieutenant, all save Jennette's part in it. But I wont say a word against it if you can persuade her. I know you are an honorable man, and would not place her in any peril, or her honor either. I will call her. But I wish you could do without the strawberry girl. `I should have to invent an entire new mode of proceeding to do so. This seems the most likely to succeed, though I wish I could devise a better. Now will you let me see Jennette alone?' `Yes; Cæsar and I will go and sit out on the stoop, and I will call Jennette down,' answered the old captain, rising.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. `This tale shall be truly told thee!' Leaning upon the shoulder of Cæsar, the captain limped out of the room, a cane held in his left hand, aiding his locomotion. Upon reaching the foot of the stairs he called out, `Jenny, dear child.' The maiden was seated by the window which overlooked the water, just where and just as we left her, a part of the time sewing, but more of the time gazing vacantly from the window with her thoughts upon her lover; for she truly loved the unknown stranger, though her strict sense of maidenly propriety had led her to bid him cease to think of her. There was some cause other than usual which brought him at this time so forcibly to mind, and made her think so much and tenderly upon him. The voice of the disguised sailor, unknowingly to her, had reminded her of Gordon, and so without knowing why she let him fill her thoughts. Well and truly did the captain say to Gordon, that she loved him, for she acted like a maiden lost-hearted. The sound of her father's voice startled her from a pleasing reverie. She was fancying that the handsome young officer perhaps should one day meet her and rescue her from some danger, and then insist on accompanying her home. Of course she could not refuse, and on the way, it being a moonlight evening, he declares his passions for her, and offers her his hand and heart. She then fancied that she accepted him after be had proved his sincerity, and that they were about to be married, and the wedding dress was sent to her, when— `Nennette! come down, child.' The voice of her father broke the vision, and she sprang from the box on which she had been seated, answering, `I am coming, dear father. How long have I been here? It seems an hour,' she added to herself. I wonder if Cæsar and his friend the benevolent sailor are gone?' She hastened to the stairs and met her father and Cæsar at the foot of them. `What, dear father! Are you going out?' `Only on the stoop to smoke and chat with Cæsar. I want you to go in and entertain my friend the while.' `Indeed, sir, he is a stranger, though it is true he has been very kind.' `But he is my friend, Jenny,' said her father in an under tone, `you mustn't say no! Go in and be civil to him at the best.' And a smile twinkled in the old man's eye, and his manner was so significant that the odd idea all at once flashed upon Jennette's mind that the sailor with the red beard had made proposals for her hand and the fifty dollars were a sort of bonus to aid his suit' `No, father, I can't go in! I am sorry that he gave you the gold! I feared that it was some sinister motive.' `What sinister motive, eh?' `Why do you want me to be so civil to him? Why do you wish me to be alone with him? He may be your friend, dear father, but—but—' `What is the matter with the child! Tears! What bug-bear is this, my dear Jenny.' `Plainly, I believe that the fifty dollars had some reference to my personal liberty,' she answered with spirit. `Good! Excellent, my dear Jennette! So you think I want to give you to the—the sailor a tete-a-tete so that he may make you an offer.' `Else why this mystery! You leave him there—send for me—bid me go in and entreat him civily, while you and Cæsar, go and smoke on the stoop' It is enough to alarm any poor girl.' `And you, I see, are thoroughly frightened, child,' cried the captain laughing. Well, don't be afraid! I will never ask you to marry him if you don't want to! Go along and wait for me on the stoop Cæsar! But let me tell you that I shouldn't be surprise if you should ask me to let you have him ere you are many days older.' `Why, my dear father!' exclaimed Jennette, with deep blushes. `I am poor but—' `But you would never take up with a common sailor—is that it?' `Yes, sir,' she answered drooping her eyelids. `Nor a naval officer either, I dare say?' added the captain provokingly. Jennette's cheeks were at first crimson and then became pale, and her bosom heaved violently. She could not speak, though she would have made some observation upon what her father had said. He smiled, kissed her and remarked in an under tone of great tenderness. `I will not trifle with you, Jennette. Your secret is known to me! I know that you love him, and you shall marry no one else unless you wish it.' `Love who, dear father?' she cried, looking at him with amazement and a half-conscious smile of intelligence. `Love the young officer who behaved so gallantly in your behalf on the bridge.' `Why, my dear father—' `And who found your needle-case and returned it to you in the milliner's shop?' `Where—how did—' `And who helped you tie the monkey to the old Italians arm.' `Who—how have—where did you—' but here she stopped covered with confusion and amazement, and hid her face in her hands. `Oh, I have a little fairy that tells me all these pretty secrets.' `Do tell me, my dear father, how you knew all this?' she at length cried with emotion and amazement. `Well, to tell you the truth the sailor Jack, in the room there told me.' `He?' `To be sure! He has sailed with this officer and knows all his secrets. He is as it were his factotum—his shadow.' `And has he sent him here to—' `I can't answer any questions,' responded the captain, shaking his head and preparing to limp off, `if you want to hear more you must go and talk with him; for he wishes to see you particularly. But you may do as you please. Come here, Cæsar, and let me lean upon you.' With these words he turned from her and took Cæsar's arm and hobbled out of the entry, leaving Jennette standing irresolute, pleased and wondering, upon the flight of stairs where this conversation had taken place. Her fingers was upon her lips as if preventing the thoughts which rushed upon her mind, from uttering themselves aloud. `Is it possible that he has found me out and sent this seaman to make known to my father his passion. If it be so, it is an honorable one, and my father approves of it. Oh, how my heart bounds. I shall not be able to keep it still if I go in but what he will hear it beat and know how I love him who sent him here. But I will go in, since my father commands, and learn what it is he has to say. Perhaps he has a note! Oh, sweet joy, if he has continued to think kindly of me! But how odd that my father should find out that I love him; for he plainly does know it. This vexes me, that I should be such a simple girl as to let him read it in my very eyes! I will go in.' With a hesitating and trembling step Jennette crossed the broken floor of the old hall and placed her hand upon the latch. Here she stood fearing to raise it, for she shrunk from yet yearned one and at the same time from the interview with the messenger of her unknown lover. By a sudden effort of courage she opened the door and entered, leaving it ajar. But imagine her surprise—her joy, the delighted confusion of her senses, as she beheld not the red-beard sailor in his round-about, but the same elegant young officer whom she had met, and met but to love. With an exclamation half uttered she started back, while her eyes rapidly traversed the room for the form of the sailor. But not seeing him, she knew that it was with him her father had wished her to have the interview. Her first impulse was to retire, but ere she could decide what to do or how to act, Gordon advanced and smiling, extended his hand and laid it gently upon her waist while his eyes sought the depths of her own. `Do not fly from me, dearest Jennette! I have long sought for this happy moment.' `You—you, have forgotten, sir, what I said when I last saw you,' she said trying to speak with self possession, but failing utterly; for embarrassment grew every moment greater. Her hand trembled in his, and she did not raise her eyes to his face, but stood like a beautiful status half in flight half in confiding repose. `I have not forgotten one word you uttered, dear Jennette.' `Why then have you followed me here? I should not have come in but I understood my father that it was a sailor who—' `I am that sailor! There lies the dress which covered my uniform, and you see there's the patch and beard which concealed my features.' `I am vexed that—that—not knowing you I should have been betrayed into some remarks I recollect making when I was in this room an hour ago! Why, sir, if your—if— Why do you come here in disguise? Would you enter a rich man's door in that costume! I am sorry, sir, that you should resort to this step in order to force yourself into my presence.' She spoke with a firmness and dignity that surprised him and pleased him. If he had been guilty of the charge, he would have been confused. `You would condemn me justly, had I assumed this disguise to force myself into your presence, beautiful Jennette. Believe me, when I say that I did not know you were an inmate of this house until on entering it with Cæsar I recognized you with joy. I came here in disguise, because I was on a duty that might endanger me if I were known. I was ignorant of your presence here; for although I have been diligently seeking you out since we met, I despaired of ever meeting you, I began to fear I had driven you from the city.' `Are you sincere, sir? If you knew my father, you knew he had a daughter.' `True, I knew he had a daughter, and it was that daughter I came to see.' `That daughter you came to see! And—' `I had not the most remote idea that it would prove to be the lovely girl who had robbed me of my heart.' `Sir,' she said coldly, `If you thought of another, you could little for me!' and she drew back from him with a pale cheek and a tremulous lip. `Both grieved and offended,' said Gordon, to himself. `I know now that she loves me! But I must explain or I may lose her forever! Fair Jennette, I have told you that I came in disguise to see the daughter of Captain Alison, and that I knew not that she was one I had ever met! Why I come to see her, you shall know! But I am about to entrust to you a secret that involves the lives of others and my own honor.' `If it is necessary that I should hear it, I will not betray it, sir.' `It is, as, on your decision, may hang the safety of one condemned to die.' `On my decision, sir!' she exclaimed with mingled amazement and horror. `Yes, Jennett. I will explain in a few words if you will listen!' Gordon then briefly and feelingly described to her the situation of Colonel Ogilvie, in prison condemned to die, the anguish of his son and his resolution to effect his rescue or die by his side. Jennette listened with deep interest. She forgot her fear of Gordon and her confidence in him seemed stronger every word he uttered. Indeed as he talked more and more they became acquainted, and when he ceased, adding, `Now Jennette, on you we both depend for success,' she cried, `What can I do? all that I can do I will! But, sir, how can I aid?' `You shall now learn!' `And Gordon then made known to her the plan by which he hoped with her aid to carry out successfully his purpose, in behalf of the prisoner. `It was,' he continued, `to ascertain if the daughter of Captain Alison, (little expecting who that daughter was,) would engage in it! Cæsar had told me of her, of her beauty, of her filial devotion, of her father's poverty, and I hoped that by the temptation of money, I might prevail upon her! I therefore came here disguised as a seaman to see her. I disguised myself that I might not be afterwards recognized in my usual costume by your father should he, after knowing our plan, decline to take part in it; for when he should subsequently hear that the escape had been effected, he would only be able to say that a common sailor had been engaged in it. But judge my surprise, my happiness, dearest Jennette, when I recognized in that daughter, your own self!' Jennette cast down her eyes! Her heart beat violently. `Providence has guided me hither to find you! Say that from this hour we are friends; that— that—dear Jennette, in one word I love you dearly. Will you give me one faint ray of hope,that—that—I may be loved in return?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. `For love what will not woman do? Dare pestilence, famine, rack and battle field.' We left our lovers at the close of the last chapter, at a moment the most interesting of a lover's existence, when the noble heart, pouring forth all its fulness, waits with trembling the response of the one beloved. Jennette heard the impassioned, yet embarrassed declaration of love, full from the lips of the young officer, with mingled joy and pain. She was silent, and grew very pale— and as he watched her lovely face for some sign of hope, a glittering tear-drop rolled down her fair cheek. He was moved—he was alarmed. He feared he had offended her. `Forgive me, Jennette, it I have displeased you,' he said, trying to possess himself of her hand. `You have not offended me, sir,' she answered, tremblingly, yet scarce lifting her eyes from the floor. `I am rejoiced to know this much. Will you suffer me to hope? I know I am, as it were, a stranger to you—' `Oh, no sir! It is fourteen months since we first saw each other,' she said, with an artless frankness that charmed him, while it shadowed forth his hopes. `I am glad you do not esteem me a stranger. May I be regarded as your friend? I am your father's, at least.' `I did not know that you knew him, sir, before!' `I am the lieutenant, as he will tell you, whom he rescued from the guard in Havana.' `Lieutenant Hays?' she cried, with looks of unalloyed pleasure. `Yes, I am Lieutenant Hays.' `My father must be overjoyed, when he knows it.' `He already knows it, and has recognized me; and so has Cæsar.' `And you also saved his life as well as my father's. And I also owe you—' `Nothing, Jennette—you owe me nothing. Only give me your heart, for you have already had mine more than a year. I have opened my bosom freely to your father, and he is on my side. Will you alone look coldly on me?' `Indeed, sir, I cannot look coldly, or feel indifferently towards you,' she said, in a sweet under tone, as if she feared to trust her voice. `Then you will not bid me forget you?' he cried, with joy. `I can hardly realise, sir, that you are sincere. I am a poor girl, and have no means but my needle, and—' `Do I not know all this?' `You are rich, sir, and of high rank, and—' `Your virtues and beauty out-rank all that I can bestow on you, Jennette. Say that you will not be so cruel as to send me away in sorrows' `I believe I will recall what I told you when I saw you last,' she said, with an arch smile. `That I must forget you? Kind Jennette. There is one step gained,' he said, in a lively manner. `Let me seal this upon this sweet hand.' And, ere she could withdraw it, he had pressed upon it a kiss. She blushed deeply, but did not withdraw it. She loved him in her heart of hearts, and in letting her hand remain in his, she was only obeying dictates of feeling, which if carried out, would have led her to cast herself into his loved arms.— He saw, he knew that she loved him. No man with a heart could doubt it. `You must allow me one other step of hope, dear Jennette,' he said, tenderly. `What is that, sir?' she slightly smiled, as she inquired. `That I may remember you always.' `I fear you will forget me, very soon.' `No, Jennette. I don't mean to try the experiment, either. I don't mean that we shall part again, soon. Will you not tell me that I am loved? I see it in your eyes—feel it in your trembling fingers—hear it in your throbbing heart. Say that I am loved again, and make me happy!' `Lieutenant Hays,' she said, with a calmness and evenness of tone that startled him, `were I of your position in society, your equal in wealth and rank, I would confess frankly that I love you, and, from the first, have not ceased to think upon you with affection. I should confess this, for I believe that you are sincere in the attachment you profess for me. But, as I am a poor, humble, unknown sewing-girl, I ought to conceal my feelings, which, as you see, I have given utterance to.' `I am now made happy, indeed, Jennette,' cried Gordon. `Sweet companion! From this hour we are one, in heart and being.' `I hardly know what to say—I have either said too much, or should say more!' `Say no more nor less. You have confessed your requital of my deep love. I ask no more nor less. From this moment you are mine. This will make your father happy.' `And does he wish this?' `Ask him, dearest Jennette.' `He is here to answer for himself,' called out the captain, looking in at the window.— `So, Jennette, all is settled, I see,' he cried, as he beheld his daughter just being blushingly released from the enfolding arms of her lover. `That is right. Did I not tell you, lieutenant, that she loved you? Saw it in her eye; but couldn't guess who. Come and kiss me, Jennette. It isn't fair that this young gentleman should have all.' `Father!' cried Jennette, in a tone of play ful reproach, as she went up to him and threw her arms around him. `Oh, I am so happy,' she whispered in his ear. `Then you have loved him, child?' `Dearer than life,' she softly replied, as she hid her head on his shoulder. `Well, my word for it, he loves you as well. He is honorable as honor itself. Love him without fear, child.' `Thanks, thanks, dear father.' The captain smiled. He then beckoned the young lover, and taking him by the hand, said, with dignity— `Sir, you have done my child great honor, and filled her heart with joy; for she has loved you from the first, with all her young heart. But she is worthy of you. You are like each other, or you would never have loved so at first sight, and so long and faithfully. I honor you, that you overlook my poverty—but you will find a treasure in Jenny, better than gold.' `I know it, sir. I loved her, ere I knew her position or circumstances. I love her more, that I know it is in my power to elevate her to a position of repose and happiness. I have feared that she would not love me.' `You do not fear that now?' said Jennette, slowly raising her long-fringed lids, and resting her beautiful tear-wet eyes upon his own, for an instant, while a soft, happy smile, danced in their depths. `Fear? the word is forever forgotten by me. Hope and joy hath taken its place.' `Come, Jennette, thy hand in his, my child,' said the old captain, as he joined their hands together. `Now, God in Heaven bless you. Love each other, and make one another happy.' `It shall be the study of my life, to make Jennette happy, sir,' answered Gordon. The maiden smiled, and looked already as happy as one could be, and when, as her father turned his head away, to hide a tear, he drew her to his heart and kissed her, she did not resist very hard, but only showed her surprise and sweet confusion by the richest blushes. `I am a blessed man this day,' exclaimed the captain. `Here last night I was ready to give up in despair, and to-day I find my daughter the honored and affianced wife of one who loves her and can protect her. All this, lieutenant, was not brought about by man's device,' added the captain, reverently. `If you love Jennette, you must thank Heaven for her!' `I do, most fervently, sir,' answered Gordon. `Now, to matters more grave and sorrowful,' said the captain. Have you asked Jennette if she will take the part of the strawberry-girl?' `No—and I almost fear to ask her, lest she may be brought into danger.' `What strawberry-girl, dear father? asked Jennette. Gordon then unfolded to her the whole plot, as planned by him, for Colonel Ogilvie's escape. She listened with deep attention. When he had ended, she was for a moment thoughtful, and then said with frankness, and smiling,— `I see who is to be the strawberry-girl. I am ready,' she added, firmly. `Noble Jennette! to consent so promptly and unurged,' cried Gordon, both delighted and sad: for he shrunk from identifying one so dear to him, with so dangerous an enterprise. `Take care of my child, lieutenant, and see that harm does not become of it to her.— She is my only child.' `If I suspected any danger, I should not suffer her to take part, captain. If the affair could be planned without her, I would much prefer it.' `Can't Cæsar, here, go in and sell apples, or even strawberries?' asked the captain. `He might hardly be admitted into the office, while a young girl would be, and could hold him engaged in lively conversation, which Cæsar would hardly be able to do.— Then it would not be in character, for Cæsar to have a smelling-bottle, and hold it at the keeper's nostrils—for the whole of our success will depend on the stupifying power of the contents which he inhales.' `I see—I see. But I would rather some other mode and scheme had been hit upon.— Do as you will, Jennette, you are now almost as much Lieutenant Hays' as mine. But have you the courage?' `Yes, dear father. I am persuaded that Colonel Ogilvie is an innocent man in heart, though bloody in hand. For his son's sake, and for the sake of Lieutenant Hays—' `Of Gordon, dear Jennette; call-me Gordon, and don't say yes sir and no sir to me, I beg of you. They are like cheveaux de frise, between my heart and thine. Be thou to me Jennette, and I to thee Gordon.' Jennette smiled, and seemed so glad that she had one to love her who was so worthy of her, that her tears mingled with her smiles. She never was so happy in her life before—and it is a question if any maiden was ever made so glad-hearted as Jennette was, by knowing that he whom she had so long loved, loved her in return. She felt that she could do and dare any thing in his behalf; and, although her kindly sympathies were touched by the recital of Colonel Ogilvie's melancholy story, and although she felt deeply for his son, yet these were not motives sufficiently persuasive in themselves, to have influenced her to take part in the rescue. But when Gordon's wishes were understood, rather than expressed, she at once gave herself up to his diction, glad to have this opportunity of testing before him her love. `There is no danger, my dear father,' she exclaimed `I have confidence in myself in so good a cause, and I know that Lieut—I mean Gordon,' she added, with a mantling blush and smile, `would not suffer me to put myself in peril.' `That I would never, dearest Jennette,' he answered, warmly. `Will you be ready at six o'clock this evening?' `Yes, Gordon,' she answered, looking into his face with a beaming glance, as she emphasized his name. `But what shall I do?' `Here is money, dear Jennette, with which to fit yourself with the dress of a country girl if you can find one at any of the shops. Nay, do not refuse the money, Jennette dearest. Are we not one? Besides, it is to be laid out for our scheme. You must provide strawberries to fill your basket and a pint dipper with which to sell them. Everything must be in keeping, At six, or soon after I will be here with a hackney coach to take you up near the prison. Hugh Ogilvie will also be here with me to go up with us. When I see you, Jennette, then I will give you the smelling bottle containing the ether, and give you more particular directions. If your self-possession does not fail you there will be no peril attending your part.' `I shall think that I do it to please you, dear Gordon,' she said, timidly uttering the tender epithet before his name. `Thanks for that kind expression, dearest Jennette. I must now leave you for a few hours to carry out the preparations. I have two saddle horses to be made ready to be entrusted to—' `To me, massa leftenant,' cried Cæsar, who was standing listening over the captain's shoulder, who, as we have stated, was leaning in at the low window of the room, while Gordon and Jennette were inside of it.' `Yes, to you, Cæsar,' said the captain, `and you must perform your part faithfully.' `I do dat, sure, massa cap'n,' answered Cæsar, warmly. `Trust dis nigger in any ting of dis kind and he nebber want back-stay to hold him in he place.' `Come with me, Cæsar,' said Gordon. `captain, I will leave my sailor's clothes here. I trust this will be the last day you will remain in this wretched tenement. I shall remove you and Jennette, as soon as the colonel's rescue to more fitting lodgings. Now, Jennette, good bye till evening, and keep courage.' `I do not shrink, Gordon.' `Good-bye, and Heaven bless you,' he said pressing her hand, and then, as if this were a cold way of taking leave of her, he drew her fondly to his heart. Their lips met, and Jennette, disengaging herself with a delightful air of confusion, retreated to the farther window to indulge her joy and her tears. Gordon shook the captain heartily by the hand, and said: `Be ready to receive me and Hugh Ogilvie at a little before sunset.' `That I will. You shall sup with me' But I forgot, we have no tea-pot, nor crockery. `We shall have no time to eat. To-morrow you shall have need of nothing. Take care of Jennette, and tell her she has made me the happiest of men.' With these words Gordon left the grateful captain, and hastened from the house, turning back once to exchange a glance with Jennette, and then followed by Cæsar he took his way up the wharf.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. `True love in the cottage lowly dwells.' We now change the scene of our story to another part of the city, in a street lined with stately edifices, the abodes of taste and wealth and fashion. One of these dwellings is conspicuous amid the rest for the architectural elegance of its facade, and a noble portico of white marble. The windows are of lofty height and open upon an iron balcony. Before it is a yard of shrubbery, the foliage of which nearly conceals, like a green bower, one of the windows with its balcony. The casement is open, and a glimpse of crimson curtains of the richest satin intertwined with muslin drapery, of pictures upon the walls, and a superb chandelier suspended from the exquisitely stuccoed ceiling, show the wealth and luxury of the proprietor. This mansion is the abode of Gordon Hays. All at once there is a movement of the drapery of the windows, and a young girl appeared on the balcony. She was a noble looking creature, with a superb figure, and a splendidly black eye. The carriage of her head was proud, yet her face expressed a kind and generous temper. She was very handsome, and dressed with great elegance and taste. A mocking bird's cage hung over the balcony, and amid the foliage pressed the gilt wires of a canary's prison. She held in her hand a cup of seeds with which she proceeded to feed her favorites, all the while answering their chirps of gratitude with some pretty playfulness of speech. There was, with all her liveliness, an expression of sadness upon her features, as if she had some secret source of sorrow. As she fed the mocking bird it picked once or twice angrily at her fingers. `Ah, nestor, you naughty bird. You forget yourself. You are very fractious of late.' `Perhaps, Bella,' said Gordon Hays, stepping upon the balcony, `perhaps he remembers his former master who presented him to you, and is trying to show you his displeasure at your treatment of the noble Hugh.' Gordon spoke not without a slight tone of reproach, though he shaped his words playfully. `Perhaps it is so, brother,' answered Bella Hays, with a slight tremor of her upper lip. `I shall have to send him to Mr. Ogilvie again.' `And so complete your work, by breaking the most loving heart that ever was devoted to woman. Why is it that you are so cruel?' `You know my opinion, Gordon, and all that you say cannot move me,' she said firmly though she was very pale. `You never loved him, to change so soon.' `I loved him dearer than life, Gordon. But I could not unite myself to a man whose father is —. But I will not allude to such a painful subject. I pity Hugh with all my heart. I have wept for him, as well as for myself. Do not embitter my life, brother, by adding to the poignancy of the sacrifice I have made, bitter words of censure. If my life could have been accepted in the place of his father's, cheerfully would I have laid it down. But when that father must die ignominously on the scaffold, die branded as a murderer and a robber, can I unite my fate with the son? Could Hugh expect it?' she said warmly and feelingly. `Love, methinks, would have little considered this. It is generally single-eyed and exclusive, and when it clings like the ivy, it withstands all storms, and though it be but a ruin which it holds to, it wreathes itself about it, and even lends a glory to it You did not love Hugh thus.' `Gordon,' said the maiden with a blushing brow, while she dropped her eyes as she spoke in a tone low but firm, `I loved him too well to see him degraded hereafter in his children. I refused his hand that hereafter in coming years his heart might not be made to bleed by having his sons insulted with the jeer that their grandfather was hanged. I I could not entail upon innocent offspring ignominy and shame. I would never a son or daughter of mine (you are my brother, I should not speak so openly as I am called upon to do) blush for father or mother. Love Hugh! Look at my heart, Gordon, if thou hast the skill to read it, and you will find it written over with the name of him you say I hate. Henceforward let this subject be dropped.' `But one question more, dearest Isabel,' he said earnestly, as he followed her into the drawing-room. `I will hear it if it does not allude to this distressing theme.' `If Colonel Ogilvie should escape from prison, and thus avoid his fate, would you then smile upon Hugh?' `But escape is impossible. The day after to-morrow, is the day set for his execution.' `But if he should escape? If he should reach a foreign land in safety, would you` knowing as you do all the mitigating circumstances, under which Colonel Oglivie committed the act, for which he is in prison would you then bid Hugh to hope?' `Is there any prospect of his escape, brother?' she cried with surprise, and keenly looking at him. `It is possible.' `Do not engage in anything of that kind my dear brother!' she cried with surprise and alarm. `I shall not put myself in any peril. Colonel Ogilvie will not be executed so long as-Hugh lives to make an effort for his release. `And has he made such—is he making such?' she asked earnestly, with a pale, earnest look, while she firmly and nervously grasped her brother by the arm. `Where is Hugh? where did you see him?' `I am glad to see you take an interest in him. I told you some days ago he had returned from sea, and would like to visit you; but you forbade his presence, and in such a manner, as has deeply wounded his feelings.' `I am sorry, if I have injured his feelings, brother. I mean't not to do that. But tell me if he is so rash as to propose taking any steps towards his father's release?' `I have told you that Hugh will not sleep till he sees his father in safety.' `Then there will be another victim. He will fail, and be arrested,' she cried with alarm and emotion, that betrayed the liveliest interest in the safety of the lover she had discarded. `Hugh has weighed all the risks. But he cannot be moved from his purpose. Aside from filial duty to his father, he is inspired with the secret hope that if he can rescue his father from the ignominy of the gallows, you Isabel may reconsider your decision, and once more bid him hope. It is for your sake he will incur this danger. If he falls into peril it will be for love of one who has—' `No bitter words brother. I tremble for the safety of Hugh. If one word from me would check him. But one word would be everything, and then if I cause him to desist from this wild project of saving his father, he will surely perish according to the sentence; while it is possible he may save him.' `I hardly know what to do or says.' `Say, that if his father's rescue is effected you will be his.' `The objections I have to uniting my fate with Hugh, will then be partially removed. It will not be so forcible, and—' `You mean to say that you will once more smile upon Hugh.' `That I will not promise; for it will be like a reward offered for him to save his father; and I shall feel myself to blame for any danger that he might fall into in this hazardous enterprise. I have nothing to say, Gordon. I leave Hugh to himself, and his own impulses. But if he is engaged in a plan to rescue his father, I fear he will be lost with him. Yet I cannot bid him withhold, lest I be guilty of Colonel Ogilvie's blood. But, Gordon, enter not into the plan for my sake.' `I shall take no part that will at all implicate me, Isabel.' `I fear that your friendship for Hugh may lead you to incur both the loss of liberty and honor.' `I shall do nothing unadvisedly, Isabel,' answered Gordon, as he prepared to go out; for it was now nearly four o'clock of the afternoon of the day on which he had left Jennette. Throwing on an over-coat, a small viol of beautiful shape and of an amber color fell to the floor. `What is this? a smelling bottle!' cried his sister, catching it up, and about to put it to her nostrils. `Where did you begin to use such womanly trifles as these, brother?' she said laughingly. `Or perhaps it is a present to that beautiful girl, the invalid captain's daughter, you have been talking so much to me about, to-day.' Gordon hurriedly took the bottle from her hand ere she applied it to her nose, and placing it in his pocket said: `It is only for my own use. I have been trying some experiments,' he answered with an embarrassed air. `But suppose it were a present to the lovely girl I have spoken to you so much about?' `Well, I should say that unless you seriously intended to offer your hand to her, it is very wrong in you to make her presents, or indeed flatter her with attention. You will awaken hopes in her bosom never to be realized; and you will render her life unhappy.' `Your advice is sensible like yourself, dear Bel; but suppose I really intended to offer her my hand.' `Offer marriage to a poor sewing-girl, for though her father has been a packet captain, you confessed to me that she supported herself by her needle.' `True, and this is the more creditable to her. Suppose, by some unforseen calamity, Bel, we should be cast destitute upon the world, and I an invalid. Do you think you would be loved any less by Hugh Ogilvie if he found you supporting yourself and me by your needle?' `But, this person is of very different condition.' `Scarcely. She is, as I have said, perfectly beautiful, though something pale, accomplished by native grace of manner, her mind cultivated, and her heart sound and true. She is amiable, filial, intelligent and sensible, and indeed possesses every quality to make a man happy, and proud of her.' `Certainly, Gordon, you are in love with her. Have a care of your heart and her peace.' `Bel,' he said, all at once speaking very quickly and suddenly, as if changing the subject, `I have at last discovered my Fair Unknown.' `The lovely girl we met in Washington street, and for whom you have shown such a romantic attachment?' `Yes, and as you have always interested yourself so kindly in my interest in her. I know you will rejoice to find out that I have discovered all about her. But she is—I am sorry to say—not rich.' `That is no positive objection, if she is respectable.' `Well that may be as folks decide. I think she is.' `Who is she?' You have so long been in chase of this Phantom, with such rare meetings, that I am almost as much interested to know who she is as you can be.' `Well, in a word, she and Jennette Alison are one and the same,' he said with an air of triumph. `Is it possible? Then I am curious to see her. How very singular.' `Wonderfully so.' `And is she so very beautiful, and refined?' `You shall see her for yourself.' `When?' `To-night. I intend to bring her and her father here in a carriage; for to tell you the truth, I cannot bear that they shall longer remain in the miserable tenement which I described to you.' `Bring her here, Gordon? are you crazy?' `By no means. Her father will be with her, and—' `But do you mean to make her an inmate of the house?' asked Isabel with surprise. `Only till to-morrow, when I trust she will be entitled to be mistress of it.' `Do I hear aright? Are you serious? Do you intend to unite yourself in marriage with this sewing-girl, however so romantic may have been your love for her?' `Don't look so proudly, Bel. The maiden is already my affianced wife. I love her and she loves me.' `Of course—you are rich and she a beggar.' `Nay, she loved me ere she knew anything about me. She has loved me ever since we first met opposite the house.' `Yes, a monkey scrape you have got yourself into indeed.' She answered with a scornful smile. `The idea that Gordon Hays, a rich young gentleman and an officer in the Navy of the United States, one who might command the hand of the proudest lady in the land, the idea of his falling in love with, and marrying a sewing-girl, is absurd enough to excite laughter, were not pity and anger paramount.' `I see that you are displeased, Bel. But you will alter your mind when you come to see Jennette Her father is a very respectable man, and she has never been a hired sewer in the shops.' She is as modest and retiring a maiden as any in Boston; and she has no superior in goodness of heart, and personal beauty.' `Well,' answered Isabel, laughing goodnaturedly, though she still looked a little vexed; since your lady-love is such a prodigy, I should like to see her. For that you are irrevocably in love is certain; and as I can say nothing to turn you from your course, I must try and make the best of it. If you bring her to the house I will receive her graciously for your sake.' `Thanks, dearest sister, and when you see her and have learned to love her, you will detain her and give her a place in your heart for her own sake,' answered Gordon, as he affectionately pressed his lips to his sister's hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. `O'er the waters light as a lark.' Gordon was not a little gratified at having so successfully combatted his sister's prejudices; for though Isabel was at heart a generous and right feeling person, she had a certain pride of family and caste that rendered her averse to any union by marriage with one of inferior degree. It was therefore a great thing for him so far to remove her objections as to lead her to say that she would receive Jennette when she came with her father. Besides, she had some curiosity to see one of whom, ere her name was known, she had heard so much. For Gordon had not failed to make her the confidant of his passion for the lovely unknown. He had described to her each meeting and its circumstances, and especially sought her sympathy and advice after the interview in the old deaf milliner's shop. The firmness, propriety and modest dignity which the unknown had shown had deeply interested Isabel in her; and from that time both of them were anxious to discover who she was. On the day in which we introduce Isabel in person to our readers, in the balcony of her house, Gordon had reached home after taking leave of Jennette and the captain, and proceeded to describe to her playfully a poor captain's daughter whom he had met, in order to ascertain what his sister's views might be. But he found her so coldly uninterested, especially when he proceeded warmly to describe her person and her virtues, that he resolved for the present to drop the subject. But ere long, not an hour afterwards, as we have seen stated, again when he revealed to her who this captain's daughter was, as being none other than his unknown. Isabel's joyful surprise at the intelligence was qualified on the instant by the knowledge that Gordon loved her; and so, instead of being 5 rejoiced to learn that the unknown was discovered, she trembled at the danger in which her brother stood of sacrificing himself to her beauty. But finding that he was honorably attached to Jennette, and that her farther opposition might offend without producing any good effect she submitted, as we have witnessed, to treat her with courtesy. As Gordon opened the door to go out, Isabel laid her hand upon his arm, and said kindly: `Would it not be best that I should call for her in the carraige? It would appear better than for you to go and bring her here.' `You are a most generous girl, Bel. You always come round right at last. But really I don't wish you to see how destitute they live; and I know it would mortify Jennette, though she might not show it. I will be here with her by nine o'clock at the latest.' `Why not earlier?' `Because I have an engagement which will occupy me till then.' `You are very much abroad of late. Last night you did not come home at all. Do not stay late to-night. What negro is that waiting before the house?' `A sailor with whom I have had some little business,' answered Gordon, glancing at Cæsar, who had been waiting on the side-walk for the last ten minutes. Thus saying Gordon left the hall, and followed by Cæsar passed up the street. `Are the horses ready?' he asked of him, as they turned into a lane which led to a stable. `All ready, massa.' `You told the hostler you would want them at seven o'clock?' `Yiss, massa.' `Very well. Now, Cæsar,' he added, as he stopped in an angle of the street, `listen to your instructions.' `I hear and 'member ebbery word.' `At seven o'clock precisely by the Old South clock you will mount one of the horses and lead the other from the stable, and proceed by the way of Tremont and Charles street round to the narrow street which runs south of that in which the jail stands.' `North Allen, massa?' `I don't know the name, but there is a narrow and obscure foot way running from it directly into Leverett street in the front of the prison.' `I know dat little foot alley, massa.' `Stop with your horses at the mouth of this alley, but do not tie them, but keep the bridles on your arm. Have them ready to be mounted at a moment's warning.' `Yiss, massa, I onderstand.' `If any one is so curious as to inquire why you stand there with the horses, you can answer—' `Dat I am waiting for de doctor.' `Very good. Now do you know your part?' `Yiss, massa.' `When you see one or two men running through the alley hold the horses for them to mount.' `Spose dey no right ones, massa?' `They will be likely to be the right ones if any, but if they say “shallop,” as they approach you—' `I may know dey are de right men. I onderstand, massa Gordon, all 'bout it.' `Very well. Now I leave you, and remember, Cæsar, all may rest with you at last.' `Yiss, massa; but whar am I to go when dey takes de hosses?' `You are to make the best of your way to the pier where I met you last night, where, if you are in time, you will go on board the shallop.' `If not, massa?' `You must be in time.' `Yiss, massa.' `Now be faithful, Cæsar, and recollect you will be well rewarded.' Thus speaking Gordon took leave of the faithful black and passed into Washington street. Cæsar stood a moment looking after him, and then shook his head gravely, as he said, while he approached the stable door: `Dis berry 'tickler peas ob business. I berry much 'fraid Cæsar or somebody get into mischief. But dat notin', so I pleases massa Gordon and missy Jenny, coz dey is sweethearts. Bress my soul, how dey does love each odder, sure nuff. It am de happiest circumstans in de world I happens to see massa Gordon on de wharf, coz I tells him 'bout missy Jenny, and when he sees her he falls dead ober head and ears in love wid her. And now she gwine to be married to massa Gordon and ride in um coach, and massa cap'n'll have a pocket full ob dimes ebbery day. Oh, arnt dis nigger de happiest brack gemman in dis 'public ob de Union. But I must look arter my hosses, coz dey are to hab a run to-night, though it be a short one, it be one for life or def. What ho, you brack colored gemman as keeps dis stable and waits on de hosses, hab you gib de two hosses my massa hire here to-day, four quart oat?' `Yah, dey habs 'em, Mister Cæsar,' politely answered a short, bow-backed, shuffle-footed negro, who acted as valet to the steeds. `Dat berry well. Now I want you to rub 'em down till dey shine like a dollar dipped in 'lasses.' `Dey shines dat way now.' `Dey doos, doos dem? Dat am jist as it should be, nigger Pete.' `Whar you massa gwine, to hab two hosses saddled to ride off at dark?' `You berry 'quisitive, nigger. My massa come here and hire de hosses of your massa, and tell him I come for 'em at dark. Dat nuff for you and de likes ob you to know, nigger. All you hab to do is to feed 'em and rub 'em. Don' gemman nebber get hosses out ob your stable after dark?' `Oh yiss, Mister Cæsar, to be sure. I ony axed for informashun,' `Well, I hab gib it to you. Now let me see de saddles and bridles dese hosses is to hab; coz I wants to hab ebbery ting sure.' `The hostler led Cæsar to a rack where he selected two saddles, and then proceeded to superintend the rubbing down of the two horses, which were fine looking bays, spirited and full of fire. After Gordon left Cæsar to superintend the horses he took his way in the direction of Leverett street, and after traversing it some distance he stopped at a hack stand, and said a few words to the hackman, and then passed on slowly until he came near the jail. He then walked carelessly past the office of the keeper, and was gratified at finding him seated there and the bunch of keys hanging above his head; but while Gordon was lookin he saw him rise, take down the keys, and go towards the court of the cells. `All is right so far. In two hours more the issue will be manifest,' he said thoughtfully. Now to the wharf, and a happy meeting with dearest Jennette.' He then returned past the jail, and stopped at the coach, the door of which the driver opened for him unasked, as if he had been previously engaged. `Where to, sir?' he asked, as he shut to the carriage door. `To — wharf,' answered Gordon, as he dropped the blinds and curtains of his hack, which went at a rapid pace in the direction of the harbor. In the meanwhile Hugh Ogilvie had remained on board his shallop waiting impatiently for the long day to pass. Fearing he would excite attention by remaining in the cove, he ran down the harbor a few miles, and returned towards the middle of the afternoon. The sun was two hours high when he once more reached the island. Here he waited for it to descend within a quarter of an hour of the horizon, when he gave the stirring order to his crew to hoist the sails and stretch away for the town. The wind though light was fair, and just as the sun disappeared he saw a moving light twinkling on the end of the pier towards which he was steering. In a few minutes more he came so near as to discern two persons, one of whom he soon recognized to be Gordon. He felt now that all was ready, and it was with a throbbing heart he steered his little vessel broadside to the end of the lonely pier; while the men secured her to the iron rings he leaped to the land. `What news? Is all favorable?' he asked, with emotion, and in an excited manner. `All is as we could desire so far, dear Hugh,' repiled Gordon as he grasped his hand. `The young girl, too?' `Yes, she has consented to take the part of the strawberry girl. But you shall see her for yourself as she is in this house.' `And I? What am I to do?' `You are to take the part of carpenter with a box of tools, which, with a carpenter's apron and a green frieze jacket I have ready for you in this dwelling.' `A thousand thanks, my kind Gordon.' `Do not stop now to thank me, Hugh. When you have attired yourself as a carpenter, which you must do at once, we shall take a coach which I have engaged and which awaits us at the head of the wharf. In the coach I will unfold our plans farther. Now come in; but first you must give orders to your men to have the shallop in readiness to cast off at a moment's notice.' `They are instructed. The sails will not even be lowered. She will lay there where she is like a courser ready bitted and bridled awaiting his rider.' `And this reminds me of the horses I have engaged for you and the colonel. You remember the narrow pathway between the houses opposite the jail that leads from one street into the other?' `Yes, well. I have stood in it looking over towards the jail when I have been planning for my father's escape.' `At the southern extremity of that narrow thoroughfare, Cæsar, the negro I spoke to you of, will be found waiting with a pair of saddle horses, one for you and one for your father. Horses cannot be so easily pursued, if pursuit instantly follows, as a carriage.' `How thoughtful you are, Gordon. You speak, too, with so much confidence that one of the horses is for my father, that I almost realise that he is at liberty.' `Do not despair. It is a bold attempt, but I do not doubt but that, if you are cool and self-possessed at the most trying time, it will be successful.' `I most earnestly pray that it may be. Then if I succeed in getting my father out of prison, I am to hasten with him through the alley opposite and take horse?' `Yes, and ride at a round trot for this pier. You will find a man here who will take the horses, while you will get on board the shallop, and steer for the British Provinces.' `I now see clearly my way, if it is prospered. Where is my disguise?' `Come in this house with me. Do not hesitate to enter, they are my friends, both father and daughter.' `I am thankful for it,' answered Hugh, as he followed Gordon into the front room, where sat the old captain, and near him stood, dressed as a strawberry girl, the faithful Jennette. Gordon, although he had been in the house before and seen her, could not help gazing upon her with fresh admiration; for he thought her now more beautiful than ever. Ogilvie on beholding her started with surprise and said aside: `Heavens, how charming. Is this the one who is to take part with us?' `Yes, and afterwards with me for life, Hugh.' `What! are you lovers?' `Without question.' `I wish you joy, Gordon. I will ask some other time how this came about.' `This is my friend, Hugh Ogilvie, for whom we are to-night to do service,' said Gordon. `We will do all in our power for you, sir,' said Jennette, taking his hand, and speaking with a frankness that almost won his heart. `Thanks, thanks, all of you kind friends,' answered Hugh, with emotion; for his heart swelled with the deepest gratitude towards those who at such an hour stood fast by him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. `Thy song is sweet, thy berries should be sweet Also, maiden.' Hugh having been conducted by the old captain, into one of the empty apartments of the old house, was left there to put on his disguise assisted by Gordon, and aided by the light of a farthing candle. `Excellent,' exclaimed Gordon, as his friend turned himself about with his carpenter's box upon his shoulder, `you would never be taken for anything else than a carpenter even by the craft.' `I am glad the disguise is so perfect,' answered Hugh. `If success but crown our efforts.' `Do not fear. Now let us go down and take the lovely Jennette with us. She is a noble girl, Hugh, and sacrifices her feelings to aid you.' `Heaven bless her for it. I am now ready.' They descended the stairs together, and in the room below found Jennette waiting with her father. `Now, Jennette,' said Gordon. `Good bye, captain; within an hour you shall hear the result.' `Take good care of my child, lieutenant,' said the captain, earnestly. `Do not let danger befall her from this step she is taking. I give my consent only because I hope it may save a really innocent person from the gallows; for I do not feel that Colonel Ogilvie at heart was a guilty man. Bless you, my child. Be firm and self-possessed.' `The consciousness of the solemnity of the task imposed upon me, dear father, will render me so,' she answered as she gave her hand to Gordon. `Your disguise is complete, sir,' said Captain Alison to Hugh, as he surveyed him, as in his green jacket, apron and old cap, he stood before him, his box of tools mounted upon his shoulder. `Be cool and wary, and I believe you may succeed.' `All will depend on Jennette's success with the keeper,' answered Gordon. `Loving her as I do, it is no light thing that would induce me to give my consent to expose her to his free gaze. But she consents freely to take the part, and I have confidence in her tact and judgment.' `I shall do my best. Good night, dear father,' she said, embracing him. The next moment they had left the house, and entering the coach at the head of the wharf, were driven away in the direction of the prison. The darkness had already set in, and the lights at the corners of the streets were the only guide of the coachman until he entered Hanover street, when the brilliant shop windows lent the glare of bright moonlight to surrounding objects. Gordon drew the curtains of the carriage closer, lest by chance they might be recognized by any passer by. He took Jennette's hand to thank her for her courage and kindness in taking part with them, and found that it trembled. `You fear to undertake it, dear Jennette,' he said in an under tone. `No, oh no,' she answered earnestly. `Still the duty is so strange—and—and if all fails it may involve you in so much danger.' `Thinking of me and forgetting yourself, noble Jennette. How this touches my heart. More and more I love and esteem you;' and he pressed his lips to her hand, `There can be no danger befall me. All is arranged so that none of the parties can suffer unless Hugh lose his presence of mind. His part is most dangerous.' `The object I have in view, Gordon, will make an iron man of me. Is Miss Alison well schooled in her part?' `I believe so, Jenuette. But I will repeat my instructions. You will as soon as you leave the carriage proceed with this basket of strawberries and your boquets directly along the sidewalk to the prison. The office door you will find open. The keeper, a stout, red-faced gentleman will probably be in the door, or seated in an arm-chair, smoking his after supper cigar. You will call “strawberries” as you approach his door, with that admirable imitation of the strawberry woman's cry you practised to-day before us. You will step into the office and ask if the keeper wishes to buy.' `Yes, yes; I know my part well now. And the vinaigrette. Does it contain nothing that may produce death, Gordon? This troubles me more than all.' `Do not fear to give it to him It contains only an extremely subtle ether which, when the silver lid of the bottle is raised and it is inhaled, produces torpor and insensibility. The effects are almost instantaneous. Your post, therefore, is so to manage while your trade in strawberries goes on, to get him to smell the bottle. The whole then is done to our hand; for the moment he becomes insensible, Hugh will seize the keys and make his way boldly to the cell where his father is confined. You will leave the office as soon as you see the keeper affected, and I shall be at hand to convey you to the carriage in which you will at once remove this outward disguise appearing in your own modest and plain costume.' `We are at the foot of — street, sir,' said the coachman calling to them through the front window of the carriage, and at the same time reining up. `We stop here, Jennette. It is but a short walk to the prison. You will go on ahead and Hugh will follow at a few paces with his box of tools. I will be at hand to protect you from danger, Jennette, or insult.' The coachman opened the door, and Gordon assisted Jennette to the pavement. Hugh followed, saying to Gordon, so as to deceive the hackman, `I thank you, sir, for giving me a ride so far on my way home. It is tiresome enough for a poor mechanic to work all day and then to walk home a mile after dark. To-morrow I will be down early to the old house and finish the job.' `Do so,' answered Gordon, as Hugh walked on. `Coachman, you will wait for as here. Turn your horses' heads the other way, and keep ready to drive off as soon as we return.' `Aye, aye, sir,' responded the knight of the whip, with that indifference as to the affairs of his “fare” which characterises this fraternity; but in his own mind, for hackney coachmen sometimes have their private opinions touching the movements of those who employ them, this was a runaway match. The place at which the coach stopped, was at the meeting of three streets, and beneath the dark shade of a large sycamore tree. The spot was retired as the street was but little frequented, though not far distant could be heard the roar of wheels upon the pavements of a crowded thoroughfare. After reaching the head of the dark lane, Hugh stopped till Gordon and Jennette came up with him. `Now, my dear Gordon, we are within a few steps of the prison. The fate of my father hangs upon us three. Let neither of us falter in our parts. Think, Miss Alison, of my grey-headed father, when your heart would fail you, and be firm for his sake. I know the task before you is a trying one, and attended with danger. But you are as brave as generous. I leave my father in your hands.' `Do not put the whole weight of responsibility upon a poor girl like me, Mr. Ogilvie. But I shall try to be true to you and to myself.' `The very tone of your voice gives me confidence. Are you sure the horses are in waiting, Gordon?' `I had best see.' `No, I will go round myself, and shall then know better their just locality when I shall want to use them. Remain here. I shall return in five minutes.' Thus speaking he crossed the street, and after traversing one of those narrow courts so common in that quarter of the city, he passed under an arched way that led him into an obscure lane about one hundred yards south of the prison. He soon came to a negro holding two saddled horses, near the outlet of a narrow thoroughfare, that led directly to the prison, its lower opening being opposite the gate. `Whose horses are those?' he said as if he desired to test both his disguise and the discretion of Cæsar. `Dey belong to de doctor, my master. He live dere, and am goin' to ride out to see somebody sick in de country. De man who own dis oder horse is in de house wid him now. Now you know, take your box o' tools and be off,' added Cæsar in an under tone, as Hugh satisfied of the certainty of this mode of escape turned and left him. In a few moments afterwards, he rejoined Gordon and Jennette, who had not left unimproved by tender converse this interval in which they had been left together. `All is safe there, Gordon,' said Hugh. `The faithful Cæsar stands ready with the horses. Now it becomes us to do our part.' `I am ready, Mr. Ogilvie, to do mine,' answered Jennette, with animation. `Good bye, Gordon, and do not doubt my self-possession,' `I do not, Jennette, dearest. But I doubt my own resolution. I am half tempted to forbid your going. As the moment approaches my imagination invests your path with a thousand perils. But go forward. All depends on the next half hour. I will hover near to watch for your safety. Do not fail to leave the office the moment you see the keeper smell of the vinaigrette. Hasten at once towards the carriage, but not so hurriedly as to excite remark. Now Heaven protect thee, and prosper your mission.' With these words he pressed his lip to her cheek, and the next moment she was tripping along many paces from him, her basket of strawberries upon her arm; and ere he could reconcile himself to the perilous position in which he had placed her, he heard her sweet voice singing cheerfully the well known strawberry cry— `Straw-ber-r-r-r-ries. Who will buy my nice fresh strawberries.' `The ball is open now,' said he, `and courageously too.' `That voice is the signal trumpet for action, Gordon. What a fearless and free tone it has. She is a noble girl Gordon, and for the part she takes this night, whether I fail or prosper, she has won my deepest gratitude. I will now go forward and do my part.' `I shall be at hand to aid all in my power,' answered Gordon, as Hugh strode forward and entered the street in which a few rods distant the prison was situated. The street was dark, save where a lamp at one distant corner and another directly above the keeper's office at the gate, threw its light upon the sidewalk. The hour was precisely a quarter to eight, as Jennette advanced to the door of the office singing her strawberry ditty most melodiously. Several persons passing, stopped to listen, and others to look back to admire her pretty appearance. The keeper sat in his office with the front door open, and the back door ajar, in order that the breeze might circulate freely through, for it was a warm summer's night. The office was a small, square apartment, in the east wing or flank of the prison, the dark, grey walls of which extended along the street for a hundred feet or more. The only access to the interior of the walls was through the keeper's lodge, where now the keeper sat in his leathern arm-chair midway between the two doors, smoking his cigar. He could see the street and persons passing, through one door, and command the interior of the prison court-yard through the other, and at the same time enjoy the cool breeze which circulated through the apartment. The walls of the office were hung with maps and plans of prisons, portraits of sheriffs and eminent criminal judges; and the likenesses of several noted criminals decorated the low mantel-piece, on which also was a scull, the head of a famous bucanier who had been hanged some years before. A piece of candle was now stuck in one of the eye-sockets. The floor was nicely sanded, and a pair of spittoons, one on each side of the keeper bore testimony to the neatness of the tobacco smoker. Behind him, or rather a little to the right of him upon a rack on which hung hats, caps, hand-cuffs, gives and old keys, was a brass pin, on which was suspended a huge bunch of well used keys. They were within reach of the keeper's hand. These were the keys of the cells, and to the possession of which Hugh Ogilvie aimed. Near the keys hung two small mysterious looking cords neatly done up, and labelled—“Noose No. 1—Noose No. 2,” doubtless hangman's hemp which had seen service. The personage who occupied this apartment was a corpulent man, with a rosy, good humored countenance, but with an eye re markable for its cool, collected expression. He was about five-and-forty years of age, wore a loose gingham jacket, his suspenders unbuckled for comfort, and his feet were thrust into green morocco slippers. He lolled back in his chair quietly smoking his cigar, as if he enjoyed it, feeling that now the duties of the day over, and his prisoners safely locked up, he had a right to make himself comfortable. While he was idly watching the smoke of his cigar idly curl above his head and float along the ceiling in miniature clouds, an apprentice entered, bearing beneath his arm a small package carefully tied up. `I have brought it, sir,' he said in a mysterious tone and manner to the keeper. And as he spoke he laid the parcel down upon the table with the air of one glad to get rid of an unpleasant charge. `Oh, the rope,' said the keeper, as he glanced at the parcel, one end of which was open. `Very well, tell your master I will test the strength of it to-morrow.' `So it is for a man to be hanged on,' said the lad, with looks of horror. `I guessed at it, but master said no. But I knows ropes ain't used at jails for nothin' else. I hopes, sir, you'll hang him dead, so his ghost wont haunt me for bringing the rope' `I'll take care o' that, my boy,' answered the keeper laughing, as the boy left the office. He had hardly composed his countenance again, and replaced his cigar between his lips, when the musical cry of the strawberry girl fell upon his ear at a distance. He raised his head and bent his ear to listen with a pleased look. Again it rose upon the air clearer and sweeter. `That is well sung and pretty voice. I must see who it is carols it so well,' he said, fixing his eyes upon the open street door to watch her as she passed. `If she be as pretty as she sings, I' faith, I'll buy her strawberries if she has a peck o' them.' The next moment Jennette stopped before the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. `Woman's wit is better for sharp projects Than man's cool judgment plodding out its ends.' The keeper of the prison gazed with surprise and admiration upon the pretty faee and modest, cast-down look of the young strawberry-girl, for the lamp above the door, as well as the light in the office, shone full upon her. `Strawberries, sir? Buy my fresh strawberries, sir?' said Jennette, with admirable self-possession; for the more imminent became the danger of her position, the more her courage rose. `Strawberries, eh?' said the keeper.— `Well, if they are as sweet as the seller, they will be worth the purchasing. Step in and let me see thee—I mean thy berries;' and, turning his chair round, he laid down his cigar and wiped his lips with his red cotton handkerchief, preparatory to tasting the delicate berries. `Step in, step in; don't be bashful!' Jennette hesitated, but it was only for an instant, and then timidly entered the lodge, and uncovered the basket, while she tried to keep her features hidden from his bold stare. `I' faith! they are noble large ones, and sweet too, withal,' he said, as he placed one of the largest in his mouth. `How dost sell them?' `Ten cents a quart, sir.' `Beshrew me, that is a round price, but I dare say the two cents over the market price goes towards thy pretty face. It an't every day we see such fine eyes beneath a strawberry-girl's hood. Look up, and let me see if thy rosy cheeks are not stained with thine own berries.' As he spoke, he would have put his finger beneath her chin to raise up her face, but she stepped back laughing, and saying— `I did not come to bring my cheeks to market, but my strawberries, sir!' `Well answered—but thy cheeks would bring a better market, girl.' `I have here some flowers, sir. Perhaps if you like not my berries, these might please you. They are very pretty, and contain some rare flowers;' and she coquetishly held up before his eyes two exquisitely arranged boquets. `They be handsome.' `Perhaps your wife or daughter would like one, sir. Ladies are fond of flowers.' `You say true, girl. What is the price of this with the blue flower shaped like a church bell?' `That, I will let you have for a shilling.' `A good sum—but seeing it is you, my pretty maiden, I will buy it for my wife.— Now for thy berries; I will take the four quarts thou hast at eight cents.' `Not less than ten, sir.' `If I give thee ten, I must have a kiss, pretty one.' `Indeed, sir, I never sold kisses; you will find them at the confectioner's.' `Beshrew me, but you know how to be witty,' responded the keeper, with a laugh. `I like strawberries, but I cannot pay thee above nine cents.' `How do you sell your berries, girl?' asked a carpenter, stopping at the door, and resting on his saw as he looked in. `If the keeper does not buy, I will take what thou hast, at thine own price—for I am to have a little party at home, to-night, and these will help greatly to the entertainment.' `I will take them all, then, at ten cents, my pretty girl; so go thy ways, Mr. carpenter—or, if thou would'st spend thy money, buy the flowers she has tied up, so prettily.' `Let me see them,' said Hugh, entering the lodge, and approaching the basket. As he did so, he managed to pass so near the keys as to knock them down from the brass pin on which they were hanging. They fell to the floor with a lond clash. Quicker than lightning, while his back was turned towards the keeper, to whose nose Jennette was closely holding a boquet, in order to keep him from seeing, he placed the real bunch in his box, and standing up, hung upon the nail the false one. `Thou art a bungler with thy box, man,' said the keeper, looking round and seeing him hanging up the keys. `Go outside of the door, and home, if thou dost not buy her flowers, for I have taken her strawberries.' `I beg your pardon, sir, for my awkwardness, but nothing broke.' `It would take hammer and anvil to break them keys, much less a fall. Go stand in the door—for I don't allow people I don't know, to stand about here.' Hugh stepped towards the door, in which he stood watching Jennette, as if waiting to purchase her boquets, when she should come out. He remarked, with surprise, her perfect self-possession and admirable tact. `I have a vinaigrette to sell also, sir,' she said, holding up before him the fatal little bottle, with its silver top. `I found it as I came along. It smells very delightfully;— will you buy it?' `Found it?' he said, taking it from her and looking at it with a covetous eye. `If you found it, you can't claim it.' `I will give it to you, sir, if you please. I do not care for it. Perhaps you may find the owner, as you know so many more people than I do.' `True, very true. I dare say I shall easily find the owner. It is worth, at the least, five dollars,' he added, to himself. `How do you open it?' he asked, trying to unscrew the stopper. `Let me show you, sir; there—touch this very small point, no bigger than the head of a pin, and it will fly open.' `Oh yes, I see. Really,' he added, as he placed it to his nostrils, while Jennette stepped back a step or two, not to inhale any portion of the escaping ether; `really, it is very delicious. It is something like—like,' here he took another long inhalation—`like lemon—no—rose—or something be— be— betw— Dear me! How my head swims! Where are you, girl? Who has put out the lights? Catch me; I am fall—' The keeper could not complete the last word. Rapidly overcome by the influence of the subtle fluid, which he had inhaled very freely, he closed his eyes, the vinaigrette dropped from his hand, and he fell over in a state of utter insensibility, into the arms of Hugh Ogilvie who laid him back in his arm chair, and, at the same instant, closed the street door and locked it. Jennette was already gone—for she had no sooner seen the effects of the ether begin to exhibit themselves, than, satisfied her part was done, she strictly obeyed Gordon's instructions, and hastened from the lodge. She had not proceeded twenty steps from the door, ere Gordon was at her side. He drew her arm within his, and hurried her away from the spot, but not before he had seen the door closed on the inner side. `Noble Jennette!' he said, pressing her hand to his heart, `you have performed your part well. I have watched the whole, from the opposite side of the street. You tremble all over. Your courage must not fly away from you now. What! are you ill? You hang upon my arm as if you were fainting!' There was no reply, and her whole weight fell upon him. He saw that she was become insensible, and, taking her up in his arms, he bore her onward to the coach, which he found where he had left it. `Generous creature! She nerved herself to a task that was too much for her. The reaction has overwhelmed her,' he said, with grief. `No—I am better now, Gordon,' she said, softly. `I can get in the carriage. It was only a momentary faintness. I am quite myself again.' `Then lose no time in throwing off this outside disguise, and thus prevent any recognition, should the keeper recover, our plan have failed, and pursuit made.' `Leave me here, and go and see what happens, Gordon. I will not leave the spot.' `I will go and learn what passes. I could not drive home with you in this state of suspense, touching the result of our efforts.— Here, if you remain in the coach, you will be perfectly safe—especially if you divest yourself without delay of your strawberry-girl's character.' `That I will do at once. Hasten, that you may return soon.' `Another dollar, coachman, for a quarter of an hour's more delay,' said Gordon, as he passed him and hastened away towards the prison. `I will wait all night at that price the quarter of an hour,' answered the man, partly to himself, partly addressing Jennette through the window of the coach. Upon coming in front of the prison, Gordon found all as yet quiet. The lodge door was closed, and all was dark within, as the passengers in the street passed and repassed without suspicion. `They suppose he has closed his office earlier than usual,' mused Gordon. `What a moment is this to Hugh and to his father! I wonder what he is doing? how far he is being successful? I will stand here, within this nook, and watch the issue. If he fails not utterly, he must soon be forthcoming.' Thus speaking, Gordon placed himself within the shadow of a recess between two buildings, where, without being observed, he could mark all that transpired at the prison. We now return to Hugh. He had no sooner placed the insensible form of the keeper in the arm-chair, than, as we have seen, he closed and locked the door on the inner side. He then, seeing the cord upon the table, left there by the apprentice-boy, took it and bound him to the chair with it, little imagining that it was the rope selected by the keeper for his father's neck. Having bound him fast, he tied a handkerchief firmly across his mouth, in order to prevent his giving any alarm, should he recover his consciousness too soon. `Now,' he said, as he took up a lantern, which the keeper used to carry with him to visit his cells, `now, my dear father, in five minutes you shall be free.' He then took the keys, and having marked well, when formerly conducted to his father's room, what keys unlocked the intermediate doors, he now proceeded to avail himself of his knowledge then gained. After quitting the office by the rear door, he found himself upon a gallery, or corridor, which extended along two of the inner walls of the prison, twenty feet from the ground floor of the lower court. He walked at a quick step along this gallery, until he came to its extremity—where a locked door barred his progress. After applying two keys, the third opened it. He entered, leaving it ajar, and found himself within a sort of vestibule, gloomy and narrow, with three passages leading from it in different directions. He took the left hand one, and, ascending four steps, came to an inner door heavily barred and bolted. This he unlocked with some difficulty and delay, and, throwing it back, found that it led him into a wide open hall, on all sides surrounded by doors that conducted to the prisoners' cells. Here he stopped, to recollect which door led to his father's, for all were so similar he could not, for the moment, decide. At length he recollected the number—and, hastening forward across the paved hall, which echoed to his light tread, he applied his key to the padlock, and, unlocking it, loosened the massive bar of iron that was secured across it. The door swung back from its hinges, and uttering his father's name with a suppressed cry of joy, Hugh bounded into the cell.— There was no sound—no response! All was silence and solitude! He looked with his lamp hurriedly all round the cell, and, with a pang of grief and deep disappointment, saw that it was vacated! For a moment he stood irresolute and almost overcome. The cup of happiness which he thought was in his grasp, had eluded his hand. Suddenly the thought occurred to him that his father being condemned so shortly to be executed, had probably been removed to the condemned prisoner's cell. Where this was situated he had no idea. Every moment of his time was of incalculable importance. He could not stay to deliberate or to examine the cells. All at once a prisoner called to him through the grating over his door `Ho, Mr. keeper, I am not well; give me some water.' `Where is the prisoner who was in the cell next to you?' asked Hugh quickly. `What? you are not the keeper. Who are you?' growled the prisoner. `A carpenter come to measure him for his coffin.' `So he'll be hanged at last, hey? Well, a gentleman ought to die as well as a rogue, if he acts like a rogue. He ain't here, but in the cell at the left of the last turning as you go through the second door. See that you give good measure, Master carpenter, for hanged men must have plenty of room, for a man stretches ten inches with a rope about his neck.' Hugh did not wait to hear the coarse and brutal laugh with which the hardened wretch ended his speech, but following his directions soon came to the door of the cell which he had designated, and which was situated in quite another quarter of the prison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. `Fling wide the prison doors! the captive flies, Like Mercury, with winged feet.' We will anticipate the arrival of Hugh Ogilvie, in his father's cell. The room in which the condemned prissoner was confined was known as the “condemned cell.” It was situated at the extremity of a narrow passage from which it was cut off by a thick wall. It had no window save a narrow and thick grated lattice above the door. The cell was but eight feet square. Its only furniture a truck bedstead containing a straw mattrass, a chair without a back, and a sort of bench which served as a table. In the centre of the room was a huge iron ring set into the stone, to which prisoners were sometimes chained for greater security. But the ring was now vacated, and Colonel Ogilvie, was seated upon his cot-bed with his face buried in his hands, and in deep thought. A faint lamp which the keeper had suffered him to keep burning, cast its lurid glare upon his person. He was a large well-built man, with a noble person, and the air of a gentleman. His hair was very grey, though his age was but eight-and-forty, but grief and shame had frosted his locks prematurely. His noble forehead was knitted with painful thought, and his find features looked pale and were sad in their expression. Suddenly the clock in a neighboring chuch tower tolled eight. He started to his feet and two or three times rapidly traversed the floor of the cell. His countenance expressed the keenest anguish. `Lo! The hours fly like eagles to their prey! It seems but five minutes and less since that bell tolled seven. I have one less hour to live! I am one hour nearer my infamous end! Oh, this is fearful, fearful!' he cried clasping his hands together. `It is not death merely I shrink at! The pang is soon over! But it is its ignominous form. To be hanged! To be made infamous to all men! This, in very anticipation maddens me! And my poor boy! My noble minded Hugh! How his heart will be torn! I tear me his proud spirit will not survive the disgrace entailed upon him! Oh, that unfortunate night! How little did I anticipate such evil to follow my efforts to possess myself of Parchsnip's papers. My motives were good and honorable and benevolent, but the result has brought me to the gallows. It is in vain, I try to reconcile myself to my fate! Were I alone to suffer I could bear it better! But my boy suffers with me! My infamy is his infamy! Hark! what is that? They are at the door! Have I miscounted my time and the hours, and are they come to bid me prepare to die? The locks turns—the iron bar falls! what can mean this visit at this hour? Who comes to my cell?' he called through the grating. Before he could receive a reply the door was swung back and Hugh with the lantern in his hand stood in the opening. `My dear father!' he cried clasping him to his boson. `Is it my son? Oh, joy to meet thee once more ere I suffer!' cried his father, overwhelmed with surprise and joy. `How is it you are permitted to come and see me? And why this dress—what is—?' `This is no time to ask or answer questions, my dear father,' replied Hugh hurriedly. `I rejoice that I have found you! Follow me without a word.' `Whither?' `To life and freedom! Come, sir.! Press closely after me. The doors are all open before us! Now swiftly and silently.' Without a word more Colonel Ogilvie, feeling like one in a dream, strode after his son who took his way straight for the keeper's lodge. Here Colonel Ogilvie's face showed his surprised on seeing the keeper bound in his chair and insensible. But he had no time to express his amazement, for Hugh throwing down the keys at his feet set the lamp upon the table and then carefully unlocking the street door looked out. `All is quiet, sir! Now follow me without uttering a word.' He opened the door and letting his father out, was closeing it when he saw the keeper struggle and heard him groan. `In good time,' he cried, as he closed the door and locked it with the key which he had removed from the inner-side of the lock. `One moment later and he would have given the alarm. Across the street, sir! Keep closely in my steps, my dear father. You will soon be free! We pass through this alley,' he added as after crossing the street he entered the narrow passage between the houses opposite the prison leading to another street. The alley was dark and tortuous, but Hugh taking his father's arm drew him rapidly forward. `Am I in a dream? Am I indeed without the prison!' he asked as they passed around. `Yes, dear father; in one minute more you will be in safety. Are you strong enough to take the saddle?' `Yes! The hopes of escape will give me new vigor.' `At the outlet of this passage we shall find two horses. One of them is for you, the other for myself. You will mount and keep close after me. Do not let any pursuit lead you to lose sight of me. We must both ride for life, sir. Here they stand with the faithful black in charge! Thus far we have safely come ere alarm given or pursuit is made.' They now emerged from the narrow alley directly in front of the outlet of which stood Cæsar holding the two horses. He had heard them coming through the passage, and suspecting it might be the party he waited for, he loosed the bridles and prepared the horses to be mounted at once. `Cæsar, the horses quick!' cried Hugh. `What de word, massa! I hab to hab a word afore I let's em go.' `True. It is “The Shallop.”' `Berry good, massa. I help de old gemman up while you mount dis one. I am most overjoyed you get him out ob prison, massa! Dis rein, massa colonel.' Hugh was already in the saddle as his father securing his feet in the sturrups received the bridle from Cæsar. `Now forward and keep by my horse's head!' cried Hugh, as he shook the reins and pressed his horse onward. Away they went, father and son at the top speed down the street, and in a few seconds were out of sight. Dat old massa colonel break him neck ridin' dat horse, so it do him no good to 'scape hangin', ony for de pride ob de ting! Wall, how de leftenant got him out ob prison is a berry markable incidence. But dis ant no place for dis child, sure. Dey find out afore long de chicken is out ob de coop and den dis be a berry hot part ob de town for a strange nigger to be cotch'd in. So I'll just hasten down to the pier and take de horses as massa Gordon told me to do. I hope dey get dere afore any pursuit is—Bress me! What dat! Prisin bell is going like mad! and dar springs de watchman's rattles, and bang and clatter go their clubs on de stones. Dare is fast getting up a berry general fussation ober in de next street. Dey found out de gemman as wos going to be hanged has 'scaped. I'll keep out ob de way sure ob danger.' With these resolutions Cæsar began to make his way towards the harbor by the street taken by the two horsemen. Gordon had waited in his covert at the angle of the building when we left him until he had the satisfaction of seeing Hugh appear followed by his father. He lingered only long enough to see them cross the street and enter the passage opposite, and then with a heart leaping for joy he hastened to rejoin Jennette at the carriage. `Upon your box at once, and drive whence you came, and don't spare your whip!' he cried to the coachman as he sprung into the hack. `What news Gordon?' eagerly asked Jennette who was now in her ordinary attire, having divested herself of the strawberry-girl's disguise. `Most happy! Hugh has succeeded! I saw him leave the keeper's lodge followed by his father. By this time they are in the saddle and on their way to the harbor-side.' `I am so thankful!' cried the maiden with joy. `And we owe all to you, dearest Jennette. Your judgment and courage have been admirable. What a treasure I shall have in you.' He pressed her hand, and as the carriage rolled past a light in a window, he saw that there were tears in her eyes. They were tears of happiness at being beloved by him. The coach rattled swiftly onward and as they were crossing a square that was midway between the prison and the harbor, Jennette saw two horsemen riding across it at full speed. `See! It must be Colonel Ogilvie and his son!' she cried, pointing them out to Gordon. `Without doubt. There they dash down the narrow lane towards the pier, and are already out of sight. Fortune favor them but for a few minutes more. Hugh has done his part bravely and successfully. How he has succeeded so soon has surprised me. Hark!' `It is the ringing of bells!' cried Jennette with a pale cheek. `Can it mean any thing.' `It is a fast toll like an alarm. It comes from the goal. There go the rattles and the watchmen are ringing their clubs on the pavements. The alarm is given. I trust they may reach the shallop in time to elude pursuit.' As they drove on Gordon could see the watchmen running in the contrary direction to gain intelligence of the cause of the alarm. He spoke to the coachman to drive at a more rapid pace; and in three minutes more the coach wheeled round the corner of the wharf and went rattling away towards the extremity of the pier. `Ho! What is this! Stop! Stop!' shouted a watchman, endeavoring to arrest the horses as they went by him. `Stop! The alarm bell is tolling!' he muttered as the hack flew onward, `and two men on horses have just gone past me like lightning, and now comes this carriage driving as if it was run away. There is mischief afloat in the city somewhere, Burbank,' he called out to a comrade, who came up, `and I shouldn't wonder if this coach and the horses that galloped by so like mad with a man on each, had something to do with it. Let us pursue.' They sprung their rattles and began running towards the end of the old wharf. Already Gordon had arrived there in the coach, and springing out ere the wheels ceased revolving, he beheld the shallop with its sails hoisted at the end of the wharf, by it two horses and the figures of two or three men. Without a moment's delay he took Jennette almost in his arms from the coach and hurried with her to the boat. `We are pursued! The town is up!' he cried. Not a moment's delay, Hugh.' `My father is on board, and I am casting off. I hear the fellows running this way. Go with us.' `I mean to! Spring on board Jennette.' `But my father!' `I am here, daughter. I will go to; for I may get into trouble if I stay.' `All aboard! cried Hugh. The horses will find their way back to their stables.' `Cæsar is not here.' said Jennette and Gordon. `He must not be left.' `Here I am, massa,' answered the negro, as he appeared suddenly upon the wharf having got ahead of the pursuing watchmen. `Shall I take de horses.' `No. They will take you. Leave them and spring for your life!' Cæsar had just time to gain the gunwale of the shallop by a wide leap when her canvas caught the breeze and pressed her off from the shore. Hugh grasped the helm, and steered her straight away from the pier, But the shallop had scarcely got under head-way ere the watchmen were at the end of the wharf, shouting and talking and making great to do at finding the horses there without keepers and the shallop putting off from the land. `We have been fortunate in distancing pursuit, Gordon,' said Hugh. `Those fellows, although they don't know what has happened, know something is in the wind from the uproar of the bells and rattles, and without being sure we were the authors of the confusion might have given us trouble.' `We have been truly successful. We are safe now, Colonel Ogilvie,' added Gordon, `let me congratulate you upon your escape, sir.' `I can hardly realize it. I seem to be in a dream. But it must be real. Let me emembrace you. You and all here I feel have been one in heart and hand in contributing to this happiness. You all have my thanks. My heart swells with gratitude that words cannot express. All is mystery to me yet. My son has not had time to give me one word of explanation. I can only realize that I am free and among friends.' `The uproar in the city seems to increase,' said Captain Alison, who had been waiting on the pier for the horsemen, and got on board with the colonel, not with the object of staying, but merely to congratulate him while the shallop was getting under weigh. `Yes,' answered Gordon, `no doubt every carriage is stopped and examined, and that officers are dispersing in all quarters. We have not been a moment too early. See how the shallop cuts her way through the water with this fine breeze. We shall soon be out of all danger.' `The pier head is no longer visible,' observed Hugh. I begin to breathe freely now. Come, my dear father, sit here and do not fear pursuit. Let us enjoy this happy hour.' `Now tell me, my son, how it is my escape has been effected?' asked Colonel Ogilvie, with emotion. `Gordon will tell you, dear father, while I give my attention to steering the shallop. I wish to get outside the castle before I give up the helm.' Gordon then proceeded to explain to the colonel the several steps whereby his escape had been achieved; and in his recital he did not fail to give full credit to Jennette, `without whose co-operation,' he said, `we could never have succeeded.' `My noble girl,' said the colonel, pressing her hand in his, `I can never reward you.' `I am sufficiently repaid, sir,' answered Jennette, modestly, `by seeing you at liberty.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. `Take horse and to the road.' While the shallop is flying away from the town with the fugitives, we will return to the prison and witness the issue of the events which have transpired there. The subtle ether inhaled by the keeper produced the effect contemplated by Gordon, as we have seen; but the condition of insensibility was prolonged fortunately longer than he intended, so powerful had been the inhalations of the keeper in his desire to ascertain what the odor might be. This great length of the swoon was highly favorable to Hugh, who was delayed above the time contemplated, by the necessity of finding the cell to which his father had been removed. As Hugh left the office with the colonel, the keeper began to come to himself. The symptoms of returning consciousness were shown in a convulsive, unconscious effort to throw off the bonds which held him. Then followed a sense of suffocation, caused by the handkerchief tied across his mouth. His full consciousness at length came to him, and looking about he found himself in darkness. `Where am I? What is this?' he muttered through his enveloped lips. `What is done to me? Bless me, I shouldn't wonder if I was dead and laid out! What has come over me? Dear me! my mouth is tied up just like a dead person's! I wonder if I am on a table! no I am in my chair. How dark it is! Those noises are rats! no—they are the feet of people walking by. I must be in my office. But bless me, how come I so! Hillooh! Help! Murder! Come and help me! Lights! Lights!' he shouted at the top of his lungs, struggling in vain to free himself, though he slipped the handkerchief from his mouth by a great effort. `Help! Murder! Foul play! Lights and guns! Mischief is in the wind! Help! help! help!' he roared like a Bashan bull, each cry louder than the other; for the poor keeper was each moment becoming more and more alarmed. His cries soon brought his family out from the dwelling, and caused person to stop at the street door and try to break it in. But it was too strong for their efforts. The under keeper first entered in his drawers, with a candle blazing in one hand, and a pistol in the other. `What is it?' he cried, as he ran in. `I don't know more than you see. I am tied in my chair, and have been gagged,' answered the keeper with a ludicrous moan. `Uunfasten me; but first turn the key and let them in.' The under keeper assisted by his wife and a servant, succeeded in untying the keeper and letting him free just as the door was opened and let in a score of people variously armed, at their head were two watchmen and a constable. `What is the matter? who is killed?' they shouted. `That I can't say, only it is not me, I find,' answered the keeper, `though the hollowing came from my lungs. What o'clock is it?' `About quarter to nine,' answered two or three voices. `Well it ain't an hour since I was sitting here with the doors open, the lamp alight, and buying strawberries of a pretty young Miss, and the next thing, I find myself tied in my chair here, my mouth gagged, the room dark, and the street door locked. If any of you can explain it it is more than I can do.' `Here is the basket of strawberries upset in the corner,' cried a constable. `And here is a bunch of flowers,' called out another. `Yes, she had flowers, too, and now I recollect I was smelling at a little bottle she said she found, which is the last thing I remember till I found myself tied in my chair, and by the very rope Colonel Ogilvie is to be hanged with. It came in to-night. Now this is all what I call a mystery, gentlemen.' `Are all the prisoners safe?' asked a head constable, who seemed to have his wits about him. `Be sure this is some trap. Take your keys and look to the cells. I'll wager some of them have been out and done this.' `No doubt! I fear it!' answered the keeper, with alarm in his face, fearing the conse quences to himself if any of his prisoners had flown. Gad zounds! Here are my keys lying on the floor! I thought I saw them on the nail!' `Here is a bunch on the nail,' said the eager officer. `Bless my stars! Here are two bunches as like as two cheeses. I am bewitched! The devil has been here to-night.' `Look closely. Is not one bunch a counterfeit of the other?' said a grey-bearded watchman. `You are right. This is the seal bunch. Some mischief hath been brewing. It is a mystery to me how I was bound and didn't know it. Come, gentlemen, I will look at my prisoners and see if this is their work.' Thus speaking he left the office accompanied by two of the officers. He had not gone to the end of the passage before he found the door, he was about to unlock, ajar. He uttered an exclamation of surprise and alarm, and hastened forward. Door after door was wide open, and with an exclamation of despair, he entered the hall surrounded with cells. All these were shut to his great relief. But he proceeded to call at each, to ascertain if any were missing. `What is the uproar, keeper?' cried the man who had addressed Hugh through the grating. `You are there are you? Why I have come to see if any of you are out. Somebody has been wandering about here to-night, for all the doors are unlocked.' `I expect it's nobody but the carpenter you sent to measure the colonel for his coffin. I bade him make good measure, and long, for hanged men stretch marvellously.' `You bade him? who have you seen and spoken with?' demanded the constable. `A man who was here half an hour or less ago. He came to the cell next to mine which the colonel was taken from, as if he expected to find him in it; but I directed him to the felon's condemned cell.' `Let us hasten thither,' gasped the keeper. 6 `I begin to suspect the worst that can have happened. See, the door is open to the cell, and look, the very cell is open!' he cried as he came to it. `He has escaped! He is not here! Colonel Ogilvie has escaped!' For a moment the distressed keeper stood staring into the empty cell as if he could not believe his eyes. He appeared stunned by the discovery. `Heaven knows I can't explain this,' he at length found voice enough to articulate. `Let the alarm be at once given. It is possible he may be on the premises. Let strict search be made. This escape is unaccountable.' The prison courts and the passages were searched in vain, while the alarum bell gave clamorous notice to the world of the escape of a prisoner. In the space of half an hour after the escape of Colonel Ogilvie, the whole corps of police was on the alert, every coach stopped, every vessel was searched, and the bridges watched. The keeper upon returning into his office was overcome with rage and confusion at the escape. In vain he tried to account for his own condition, bound in a chair, and insensible. All was mystery to him. `Do you recollect what you were last doing?' asked the High Sheriff, who was on the spot, and closely questioning him. `I only recollect that while I was talking with the young girl about the price of her strawberries, she handed me a little smelling bottle. Just then a carpenter with his box of tools come in, and asked her the price of the strawberries. As he walked round her I recollect he knocked the keys off the nail with his box, which was on his shoulder. But I saw him pick them up and replace them, and at the same time I ordered him out of the door.' `And instead of putting back the keys he knocked down,' said the sheriff, `he placed this counterfeit bunch on the nail, and kept the real ones, with which he unlocked the doors and released the prisoner.' `That must have been it, Mr. Sheriff,' answered the keeper. `But how could he have done it and I awake?' `You was not awake it seems, sir,' answered the sheriff sternly. `You acknowledge that you were bound in your chair without knowing it.' `That is true, and that is a mystery to me, sir. I was not asleep, I must have been struck and rendered insensible. The last thing I remember I was smelling the bottle to ascertain what the scent was.' `And here is the bottle, sir,' said one of the watchmen. `I just found it in the fire-place.' `Let me look at it,' cried the sheriff. `Now it is my opinion this contains some soporific which put you to sleep suddenly. I will test it. Who will smell of it.' `I will, sir,' answered the keeper. `I wish, if it is what you suspect, to shew you that I could not help it. If it puts me to sleep I shall not be so much blamed. If it does not I suppose people will say I was drunk. Give it to me.' The sheriff placed it in his hand, and he placed it to his nostrils. After three or four strong inhalations his eyes closed, his head sunk upon his breast, and his limbs relaxing he fell backward wholly inanimate. The sheriff and those who stood around watching the effect beheld this result with amazement. `It's clear enough now,' said the sheriff as he satisfied himself that the keeper lay perfectly unconscious, `it is clear enough now that this bottle contains some active volatile essence which produces insensibility. He says he took it from the strawberry girl. There is no doubt that she was a party to the abetting the escape, and this carpenter another concerned in it. Throw water in his face and bring him to.' After some difficulty the keeper was restored to animation and consciousness. `Did it make me sleep, friends?' he asked as he gazed around him. `Yes, you have been as a dead man,' answered the sheriff. `It is easily explained now how you happened to suffer yourself to be bound. The success of this experiment has saved you from arrest. You have been the victim of a deep laid plot.' `Thank Heaven, then, that I am not so much to be censured,' he answered with looks of great relief. `The little minx, when she handed me the bottle, asked me so innocently to tell her what its odor was, for she had found it in the street. I see clearly that it was a plot. `Let every search and inquiry be made for this strawberry girl and this carpenter,' said the sheriff to two of his officials. `Describe the girl, master keeper.' `She was as genteel a figure as one would wish to see any where, about seventeen, with fine dark eyes, a pretty rosy mouth, and beautiful brown hair. She was pretty enough for that matter.' `Do you think she was a real strawberry girl?' `She had a basket of strawberries which you see are here now. She left them basket and all, and I had not paid her.' `This confirms my suspicions. Let me see the basket? It is a regular strawberry basket indeed, and has had use. But, nevertheless, it is my opinion from your description, that this strawberry girl was acting a part. At any rate she was a party to the conspiracy. Well, Collins,' cried the sheriff to the head constable, who then came in, `any tidings of the fugitive?' `Nothing certain, sir. I learn that two men on horseback were seen riding at full speed down Court street and into Hanover street, where the watchman says they passed him at full speed, and the moment afterwards he heard the alarum bell ring out.' `This looks sucpicious. Horses may have been resdy for the prisoner to escape on,' said the sheriff. `Send mounted men at once on their track.' `I have despatched Hayley and Barnes, sir.' `You have done well. No better men could have been selected. Where did you get horses?' `At the nearest livery stable.' `We should have a horse police. I have before this shown the city the necessity of it. Foot police is almost inefficient.' `But I have more to add, sir. The two horsemen had not passed into Hanover street and more than got out of sight, before a hackney coach made its appearance from up Court street, and turning short into Sudbury street, went down that street at full speed.' `This is news! The prisoner was either in the carriage or on one of the horses,' cried the sheriff. `Which watchman saw the carriage?' `Number 18.' `Did he recognize it?' `No, sir. But the alarum bell then pealing out, and hearing the rattle sprung in the direction of the prison, he suspected the carriage and gave chase; but finding he had no chance of coming up with it, he returned to his post.' `He should have followed till he came up with it,' answered the sheriff. `But neither horses nor coach can get out of the city unobserved, thanks to our bridge-girdled city. Send men to every bridge and to the neck.' `I did this before coming here to report,' answered the Chief of the Police; `and I instructed the man who first struck upon their track to follow it up, despatching a messenger to me informing me of the direction.' `You have done everything that could be done, sir, your promptness does you credit. We ought soon to hear from one or the other of the avenues. Here comes a man mounted!' he exclaimed, as a person rode up at top speed, and drew rein at the door. `What is the news, Darby?' `Neither hack, nor saddle horse, has crossed Charlestown bridge to-night, the toll-keeper says. I left orders with him to stop any that should try to pass.' While he was speaking a second officer galloped up, his horse foaming with spurring. `Nothing like coach or mounted men have left the city by the mill-dam avenue, captain,' he reported, as he touched his cap to the Chief of Police. `Here comes my man that I despatched to Cambridge and Cragie bridges,' said the Head of the Police, as a third horseman dashed up to the door of the prison. `Well what news?' `Nothing has been seen of hack or coach of any kind, nor of men on horseback. No one has passed, even on foot, save those well known.' `We have now only to hear from the neck,' said the sheriff. `Those horsemen and the coach must have gone somewhere, and must be traced to their stopping point.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. `The sea is our empire—the deck is our throne.' Leaving the chief of police and his officers to follow up their search for the fugitives we will return to the little shallop. Favored by a fresh breeze, which blew in a favorable direction, the light vessel went bounding away down the harbor like a bird escaped from its prison. All was joy and congratulation on board. Each moment separated them farther and farther from pursuit and danger. Thirty minutes after leaving the pier they passed the castle, whose frowning walls rose high above their heads. They could hear the sentry's call of `all's well,' and the tramp of the relief guard as it went its rounds. When Hugh saw the castle astern he breathed more freely. `You are now safe, father,' he said, interrupting Gordon, who was just completing to him his narrative of the plan pursued towards effecting his escape. `We are a league from the town, and no one will think of pursuing by water.' `I feel safe. I am full of gratitude to you my son, and to Lieutenant Hays and this fair maiden, and to all who have aided me. I am just beginning to realize my safety. Having made up my mind to die it is hard to believe that I am rescued from the horrible death which menaced me, and from which there seemed no reprieve by human means. The transition from this state of horror to one of peace and security overwhelms me.' `The city is quiet,' said the captain. `We can't hear the bells at this distance,' said Gordon. I have no doubt the most vigorous exertions will be made to recover you, colonel. You are a prisoner of distinction, and under the peculiar circumstances every effort will be made to re-capture you.' `That I well know,' said Hugh, gloomily, yet resolutely. But whoever re-takes my father will have to fight for him. But I do not fear pursuit.' `I am not disposed, gentlemen,' said Capt. Alison, who was seated aft upon the taffrail, while the colonel reclined upon a settee opposite, for his long imprisonment ending in his hard ride to the pier had almost overcome his physical strength. Near the colonel, on another settee sat Gordon with Jennette by his side, her hand fondly held in his. Hugh stood amidst this group at the helm, steering the shallop, and giving from time to time orders to the crew. Cæsar seemed to be in his element, and took charge of the main sheet prompt to obey the slightest sound of the young helmsman's voice. Forward were the old man and two boys who constituted the remainder of the shallop's crew. The wind blew fresh, and drove the swiftly sailing craft along at the rate of eight miles an hour. As they passed island after island their confidence in their security from pursuit increased. `I do not apprehend any pursuit now,' said Gordon in allusion to the remark made by Hugh, `but it is likely that if they do pursue it will be by water.' `They will not suppose carriage or horses left the city by water,' answered Hugh. `No; but the watchmen who followed us to the wharf will of course report that those who came in the coach and upon the horses took boat.' `I did not think of that,' answered Hugh. Ease off that fore sheet a little. A small pull upon the main halyards, Cæsar. The gaft dips a little.' These and other directions showed Jennette that he feared pursuit still. She felt alarmed at the thought, for Gordon was involved in the peril of a rescue. Of her own danger she did not once think. Her fears were for the colonel and for her lover. `Do you think we may be pursued?' she asked in an under tone, of Gordon. `Lieutenant Ogilvie seems to look anxious.' `It is possible, dear Jennette. The watchmen will of course direct the police how to follow; for they will not question but that the party they saw drive down the wharf and sail away in such a hurry contains in its number the escaped prisoner. But do not be alarmed, Jennette. We have so much the start of all pursuers that we have nothing to fear.' `I do not fear for myself, but for Colonel Ogilvie and for you. I am not thinking of my own danger.' `I well know that, noble Jennette. But we are in safety. Here we are nearly down as far as Nix's mate. This is full six miles from the city.' `What is your future plan? Which course do you steer after getting outside?' asked Captain Alison. `My plan was to sail direct for Nova Scotia if I had come on board the shallop only with my father,' answered Hugh. `But I have no power to take you with me with your daughter and Lieutenant Hays. Indeed I am not provisioned for so large an accession, nor indeed are there accommodations for Miss Aliion.' `You can touch at Gloucester, at Cape Ann, and leave us,' said Gordon. `We can easily find conveyance back to Boston by the post coach.' `That will be the best plan. With this wind we shall be off Cape Ann by four o'clock in the morning. I can run into the harbor and leave you at the first pier in the town and by sunrise be a league at sea again.' `I am glad that you can do this, my son,' answered Colonel Ogilvie; `for I have been in great distress touching the presence of these my friends with me. I would rather have remained in prison than involve them in my fate should we be overtaken. If it were possible, Hugh, I could wish you might land them at some nearer point.' `I cannot, dear father, unless I leave them upon one of these barren islands. Cape Ann is most accessible, the best out of our course, and but thirty miles from Boston They can return to the city without suspicion.' `I am glad no suspicion can fasten upon them.' `It cannot, as we have not been seen in our proper characters. Jennette was disguised as a strawberry girl, and, being naturally pale, was highly rouged, while I was not seen at all. As to the captain he remained at home, and only got into the shallop in the hurry of our departure lest he should be qnestioned too closely if he remained.' `And also to accompany my dear child,' added the captain, with a smile. `I would have hardly let her gone alone with you into this danger.' `We have now the light abeam, Gordon,' said Hugh. `We shall soon be dancing on on the waves of the open sea as free as they.' `Let me take the helm, Hugh,' said Gordon. `You must be weary.' `Weary, with my father safe? Oh no. But you may relieve me for a while, Gordon. I wish to take your seat and thank Miss Alison for the part she has taken in this night's affair. `Never,' he added, as he resigned the helm to his friend, `never was so much self-possession shown as Miss Jennette exhibited during the trying time she was talking with the keeper. She had the most perfect command of her countenance and voice, and conducted her part so bewitchingly that I am not surprised that the keeper was captivated. But I think he will take care how he tries to get up an admiration again for a pretty strawberry girl. To your courage and presence of mind, Miss Alison, all our success is owing,' he added, with grateful enthusiasm. `For this I am most thankful,' responded Jennette. `It makes me proud of my child,' said the captain, with emotion. `She is very dear to us all,' said the colonel. `From this time I shall feel towards her as a daughter.' `I should like to know how the keeper felt when he came to himself!' said Gordon. `Perhaps your portion was so powerful he sleeps yet,' said Hugh. `No, or the alarm would not have been given.' `True, true.' `A taut haul on the fore-halyards,' said Gordon to the old seaman forward. `That will do. Now haul aft the jib-sheet all it will bear. We must lay close to the wind with it from this quarter, now we are laying our course for Cape Ann.' `Then we are fairly out of the harbor,' cried the colonel. `Yes, father, and are now stretching our way between the Graves and Nahant for Gloucester.' `Then I have reason to pour out my heart in gratitude to you and heaven. I now feel that I am in safety.' `In three days we can reach the British Provinces, father, where the laws of the United States cannot reach you.' `Alas! I shall enjoy liberty and life there, my friends, it is true; but what do I leave behind me in my native land? The name and infamy of a felon! The consciousness of innocence in heart of the act of my hand alone can make life endearable. In the sight of heaven I know that I am acquitted—I know that the deed I was engaged in when I unfortunately shot the driver was an honest and good one.' `No one doubts it, sir,' answered Captain Alison, between whom and the colonel there had been a renewal and revival of their former acquaintance. `By and by the world will do you justice. None of your friends believe you had any other motives than an honorable purpose in view in stopping the mail bags. But it is a pity it was done.' `I regret it now. It would have been better the young man's fortune should have been lost to him than that ruin and disgrace should fall upon me and mine. But I could not foresee this,' added the colonel, sighing. `Where is this base lawyer, sir, whose villany caused you all the wrong you have sufered?' asked the captain. `He is in Boston still, I doubt not, practising his roguery.' `But you saved the estates to the young gentleman?' observed the captain interrogatively. `Yes, and this is some satisfaction.' `But he has proved unworthy of all that has been done for him,' said Hugh, indignantly. `When he heard that my father was arrested and thrown into prison, he at once, without communicating with him, made an application to the Probate court to have a change of guardians. And though my father wrote to him saying that he wished to see him, he paid no attention to his request, and eved returned his letter to him.' `Doubtless a young man proud and selfish, with but a shallow mind,' said the captain. `No, on the contrary a young man of fine intellect,' said the colonel, `though he was proud, but I thought only enough so, till he cast me off as soon as he thought I had degraded him. Well, I do not blame him. All the world did the same. Appearances were against me.' `But did he not understand that you incurred your ruin by an effort in his behalf?' asked Gordon earnestly. `No. I did not tell him. I should have thereby opened to him the charge made by Parchnip of legitimacy, which would have been a terrible blow to him. Though not true it would have preyed upon his mind.' `And you did not then bring in that plea in defence at your trial?' cried the captain, with surprise. `No. I merely told my council that I had stopped the mail, to obtain from it a parcel that involved the ruin of the happiness of others, that my unfortunate recounter with the driver was purely accidental. This was sufficient, for the particulars would not have a vailed me more.' `Not unless the court would compel Parchnip to state on oath that he had put such a parcel into the mail, and intended to use it to the injury of the heir; but of course,' added the captain, `he could not have been made to do this.' `No one who has ever known your, sir,' said Gordon, `doubts your uprightness of intention, Colonel Ogilvie, in that unhappy affair. You were not so much tried for highway robbery (of which nobody believed you guilty in intention) but for the death of the coachman.' `Yes, yes. I know that. Poor fellow. I would that I could recall that hour. He would not have fallen had he not turned my pistol in the struggle upon himself. I did not fire. The weapon went off in my hands. But I shall never forget it. His blood is upon my head.' As he spoke he dropped his face into his hands, and seemed absorbed in grief. `What is the name of this young heir?' Lieutenant Ogilvie? asked the captain. `Heber Deforrest. He is now in New York I believe, for he has left the University and come into the possession of his large fortune.' `He should know that Colonel Ogilvie suffered all he has done for his sake,' said the captain warmly. `You should inform him.' `Not I,' answered Hugh haughtily. When we meet it shall be as foes.' `Nay, my son—' `Nay, my dear father, not one word. Heber Deforrest and I never meet as friends.' `I have a great fancy to see this Parchnip,' said Gornon after a few moments' silence, during which only the dash of waters about the low sides of the shallop reached their ears, `I would like to meet him if only to see what sort of a complexioned villain he is.' `We may both one day have this privilege,' answered Hugh. `What is that ahead?' cried Colonel Ogilvie quickly, as a large dark object loomed up in their course. `It is a ship. I see it plainly now,' responded Gordon. `Keep her away sharp, Gordon,' cried Hugh. `She is standing right dead against us.' `I will clear her,' answered Gordon, as he put the helm hard up. The next moment the lofty column of spars and canvass passed them with a majestic uplifting of its bows upon the ocean swell, and the shallop was almost lost in its magnitude as it flew by. In a few seconds afterwards the tall ship was lost in the darkness and distance astern. Jennette had never been out to sea before. She looked around her but no land was visible. The great breadth of the starry skies above her head and the dark boundless ocean around her filled her soul with awe, and she held firmly the hand of Gordon, trembling at her nothingness in that vastness of space amid which she seemed to be suspended; for stars were as numerous in the sea beneath as in the sky above, and all seemed to be as the firmament about her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. `The wind is fair. Swift o'er the sea Our bark pursues the bucanier.' The report of the several messengers sent by the chief of police to the several avenues which led from the town, led him to suspect that the prisoner who had made his escape in such an extraordinary manner was concealed in the city. `That is my opinion also,' said the sheriff. `I shall have the strictest search made, besides offering a reward of one thousand dollars for his arrest.' `To which,' added the keeper, `I will add five hundred. This sum ought to bring him out if any one hides him. But who have we here?' `It is Collins,' answered the sheriff, as a man came riding up at full speed, and threw himself from his horse as if the bearer of important intelligence. `What now?' `The carriage has been traced to the — pier, and also the two horses,' answered the officer, almost breathless with riding and eagerness to make known the burden of his news. `Well, and from the pier?' quickly demanded the impatient sheriff. `At the wharf they embarked in a small schooner, and sailed swiftly down the harbor.' `How do you know this?' `Two watchmen saw the mounted men ride at speed down the wharf, followed by a carriage at full speed. Hearing the alarm bell at the same moment they suspected something wrong and hastened after them. By the time they reached the end of the wharf, the persons who had rode the horses had sprung from them and got on board the shallop, and those who were in the carriage also got on board, and out of reach.' `This is strange news. Was the hackman arrested?' demanded the sheriff. `Yes, and is in custody. But he declares he knows nothing about his “fares.” That he was hired to drive down there by a man with a female in his charge.' `He must be examined closely. And the saddle horses?' `They prove to belong to the livery stable in — street.' `This must be looked into. Now what say for pursuit, Mr. chief of police.' `We can pursue in the Revenue Cutter,' eagerly responded the chief of police. `I will at once to the Custom-House officer, and get authority, and meet you at the head of Central wharf.' `Let there be no delay. I will ride there at once with such officials, as I think may be required. Collins, you should have brought the watchmen with you.' `They refused to leave their beat till they got permission from the captain of the watch.' `Very well, I will ride round there with you as we go down and see them. I wish to get a description of the shallop.' `They said it was like a fishing schooner, with two masts.' `I will see them myself. These fugitives will have not more than half an hour the start of us, if the Cutter gets speedily underweigh. Come, and you Mr. Keeper take care none of the rest of your prisoners escape. I shall do my best to bring this one back again.' `I hope you will, sir.' `You must also try and overcome your love for strawberries.' `I shall hate them like poison, sir, ever after this.' `And pretty faces,' `Shall be my abomination.' `And smelling bottles,' `I shall be as much afraid of them as of a blunderbuss.' `I hope so. Now, good night. Shut thy doors, and keep all close,' added the marshal, as he rode away, followed by several of his attendants. `Keep all close? That I will, so that not a mouse shall get out,' muttered the keeper, as he locked and doubly locked his doors after their departure. `This has been an unlucky night for me. So much for loving strawberries, and to chat with a pretty face. I'll reform on this score from this hour, and forswear berries and berry girls, and especially smelling bottles. The little rogue! To be playing her pranks upon me with her demure face. If I ever get her under lock and key, I'll rate her most roundly. This comes of being sociable. I may yet get into trouble by it. The governor may look upon it with a different eye from what the marshal does. I fear me I'll be broke for this night's work if they don't catch him. And he tied me, too, with the very cord he was to be hanged with. Well, I pray that I may see him swinging by it yet. I will go now and see that each of my rogues are safe. Bring the light along, Riggs,' he called to the under keeper, as he left the lodge on his tour of inspection. The sheriff and his party, accompanied by the chief of police, proceeded with all haste to the quarter of the city where the carriage had stopped; and from the watchmen obtained a description, so far as could be given of an object seen in the obscurity of night, of the shallop. The hackman could throw no light upon the persons. He could only say that he had been hired at such a time, by such a person, dressed so and so, and in driving away so fast he had only obeyed orders. Of the persons on horseback, he knew nothing and could say nothing. `The fact is,' said the marshal, as he rode away by the side of the chief of police, `the whole has been a deep laid and most successful plot. Even the very vessel to carry the prisoner off, was provided by his friends.' `No doubt the young girl whom the man brought to the carriage was the strawberry girl,' said the chief of police. `This is very clear. But who it was with her, can't be even gnessed by the hackman's description. There is no doubt but that the fellow is innocent of any knowledge of the object of his fare; for it is not likely in so important a matter they would take him into their confidence. We must now see the owner of the stable, and know to whom he hired his horses.' Upon reaching the stable, they learned from the proprietor that a young gentleman, whom he had seen but once or twice before, but whose name he did not know, had ordered them in the morning to be in readiness at seven in the evening. `And did he come for them himself?' `No; he sent a negro servant who took them away by his order. I was not in at the time; and they were delivered by the hostler as I gave him instructions to do when they should be sent for.' `And you have no idea who the person was?' `None in the least.' `Where is your hostler?' asked the chief of police. `He is at hand. Peter, come here.' `Yiss, massa.' `Do you know the person you delivered the two saddle horses to, to-night?' questioned the marshal. `Don't know him, massa. I ony knows he berry imperent and sassy nigger.' `Did you never see him before?' `Nebber, massa.' `And you did not see the negro, sir?' asked the chief of police of the proprietor. `No, as I was out.' `Will you describe the gentleman?' asked the marshal. `He was four or five and twenty, tall, with a military air, half-whiskers, a clear, bold, blue eye, and fine teeth. He is altogether a gentleman in appearance and language.' `Should you know him if you should see him again?' `I think I should, sir.' `Very well; I may see you again. Good night. Come, gentlemen, let us to the harbor side, we have delayed full long. By this time, the Cutter will be in readiness for the pursuit.' Thus saying, the chief of police, the marshal and the rest of the party, hastened forward. Upon the wharf, they met the collector, who not only cheerfully gave them the use of the cutter, but offered to go with them. Upon reaching the end of the pier, off against which the armed schooner lay, they could already hear the hearty `heave-hoyeo' of the seamen on board of her, as they hove away at her anchor. `I despatched a person to get underweigh, marshal, before I myself left home,' said the collector; `so that there might be no delay. Here comes her boat to take us on board.' While he spoke, a gig with four oars pulled in to the stairs, and an officer in the stern-sheets rising up, hailed— `Who waits there?' `The collector.' `Aye, aye, all right, sir. Just step into the boat as we back her up.' The next moment the marshal, the chief of police and four officers basides the collector himself were seated in the gig and on their way out to the schooner, which with her fore top-sail loosed, and her main-sail set, was waiting for them.' `This is a very extraordinary affair, sir,' said the collector. `I could scarcely credit it when I heard it. Have you any idea who assisted Colonel Ogilvie?' `Not the least. The whole scrape was admirably managed. A young girl under the disguise of seeling strawberries to the keeper, managed to place in his hands a smelling bottle containing ether, which, upon his inhaling it, made him insensible. The keys were then taken by some man said to be a carpenter, who unlocked the prison doors. Before the keeper was restored to himself again, the bird had flown. We are satisfied that we have traced him and his abettors to the end of — wharf, where they embarked an hour ago in a shallop. Doubtless they have taken advantage of this leading wind to put out of the harbor.' `No doubt they intend escaping to the Provinces, or to Bermuda, where they will be safe,' said the collector. `Doctor Convers the forger escaped in this way eight years ago; and when Bellinger the highwayman was re-captured, he was overtaken being in a fishing boat with one sail and a broken oar, but ten leagues this side of Halifax.' `It is probable then, that this shallop will make for the British Possessions,' answered the chief of police. `But here we are on board,' he added, as the gig pulled up along side the rakish looking schooner, the tall, slender masts of which seemed to hang far over her stern. As they reached the deck, the officer in command gave the order to sheet home the top-sails, and set the jib and fore-sail, while the anchor which had been sometime apeak was rapidly suspended from the bows. The cutter was under full sail in less than two minutes after the party had boarded her and gathering momentum each instant, she soon went bowling along down the harbor with a bone in her teeth. The city, with its dark, faint outline of roofs, towers and domes fast faded into the indistinctness of the surrounding night. Before them, towered the walls of the castle which was swiftly passed, and seaward like a hawk swooping towards its prey, the warlike little cutter went flying along at the rate of nearly ten miles an hour. `You understand your instructions, I believe, captain,' said the marshal, as he took his place by the side of the commander, who with his glass at his eye, was constantly sweeping the water on one side of him, while his quarter-master with another spy-glass was closely scanning the other side. `Yes, sir. You are in chase of a prisoner supposed to have escaped in a two-masted fishing shallop. If she has gone down the harbor, though she has an hour and a half the start, I pledge myself to fall in with her before morning.' `But she may have taken the south channel towards Bermuda,' said the collector.— `And if we take the eastern one we shall miss her. This will be our disadvantage.' `A small shallop is more likely to take the course towards the Provinces,' answered the captain. `She will hardly venture out to sea far. Moreover the flood tide is coming in through the south channel so strong she would hardly take it when in running northward the tide would help her rather than retard. I shall, however, decide when I get at the point where the two passages depart from each other.' `Is your vessel doing your best, sir?' inquired the marshal. `Ten knots, sir. No other vessel could get nine out of this wind. No shallop can sail eight. I shall be sure to come up with her on one course or the other by sun rise. If standing three or four hours eastward does not show her ahead, I shall stretch away south after and shall be sure to find her.' `Sail ahead!' shouted the look out forward. `I see it. It is a large ship coming in by the east channel. I will hail her and see if she can give me any information of the shallop.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. `We are pursued! Our refuge is in flight.' The ship which had been discovered ahead of the cutter now came near, and the captain of the latter, seizing his trumpet, sprang into the rigging and hailed. `Ship ahoy!' `Aye, aye,' responded from the deck, in a clear, hearty tone. `Have you seen any thing of a small schooner—a fishing shallop, going seaward?' `Not two miles astern. She passed us near the Graves, under press of sail, steering North East.' `Thank you, thank you,' answered the captain—and the next moment the ship and cutter were separated by a wide distance.— `Now, gentlemen, I think we are on the track of the fugitives. What do you say?' `There is no question of it,' answered the marshal, with animation. All was now excitement on board the cutter, and nearly every body was on the watch, in order to get sight of the shallop, which, all were satisfied, could not be far ahead—at the least, not more than half a league. Soon after speaking the ship, the cutter bore up and stretched away towards the East and North, and soon afterwards the roar of the breakers upon the Graves, a ledge of rocks forming the outmost boundary of Boston harbor, distinctly reached their ears. `How far can you see a vessel in the night?' asked the marshal of the captain, as the open sea lay before them, and its waves began to rock the cutter. `About a mile, with the glass, such a clear night as this; but so small an object as this shallop is likely to be, will hardly be made out till we are within half a mile of her. If she steers for the Provinces, she will lay her course about E. N. E., and I shall now keep away a little, to make as much easting as she is likely to do. In another hour we shall be likely to see something of her. Keep your eyes open men, there aloft, and on the bows.' The cutter now went dashing on at a fleet pace, like a high mettled courser, inspired by the chase, and the hopes of the pursuers were raised to the highest expectations. The collector was the only one who seemed to want faith. `We may be pursuing a phantom, or about to frighten some honest fisherman,' he said, as he walked up and down the deck. `I do not think there is proof enough to show that Colonel Ogilvie is in the shallop which passed the ship we spoke. No one saw the faces, or persons even, of those who left the coach and their saddles, and embarked.' `But I have curiosity,' said the marshal, `to know who did embark in such hot haste. If not Colonel Ogilvie and his friends, it was no doubt some other criminal, whom it becomes me to overtake and arrest. But for my part, I am satisfied that our prisoner is in the shallop.' `And if he is taken?' remarked the collector. `If he is taken he will be hanged, as condemned to be. We can't do any thing worse to him.' `Do you really believe, Mr. Marshal, that he intended to rob the mail? a man of his wealth and position in society?' `It does not seem plausible; still, as it was proved that he did cut open the bags, and take out a package, and also wounded the driver to the death, his sentence is a just one.' `It is a great pity, for I knew and esteemed him. He seemed to me to be the very soul of honor. Had I my wish, I tell you bluntly I would rather, now he is well off, that he would escape than be hanged. He has a son in the navy whom it would disgrace were his father to be hanged.' `A son in the navy? Yes, I recollect, now, hearing of him. Where is he?' `I saw him not ten days ago, in State street.' `Then I see who is at the bottom of this escape!' cried the marshal. `And this accounts for the flight by water. If we do not find his son in command of the shallop, then I will let the prisoner go scott free, should we take them. What do you see, sir?' asked the marshal, eagerly, of the captain, who was looking with unusual earnestness through his glass, at some object about four points off the larboard bow, to windward. `I think I have him now,' murmured the captain. `Look this way, quarter-master, and see what your glass makes out.' `It is a small schooner, sir, without doubt. But it is too far in shore for the chase,' answered the quarter-master. `She may be making for Cape Ann first— and, in that case, this is just where we should look for her,' responded the captain. `Luff a little, and haul aft the fore and main sheets there, Mr. Waldron,' he called to his lieutenant. `Pull or two to the topsail braces. That will do. We must lay dead to windward, to cut her off. Now, my fine fellow,' added the captain, as he saw his vessel bounding away to windward, and tossing the spray over her deck like snow, `we shall soon make out your metal.' `She is luffing, too, sir,' quickly cried the quarter-master. `She discovers that we pursue her.' `This looks like guilt, Mr. Collector,' remarked the chief of Police, rubbing his hands at the prospect of soon grasping his prey. `Yes, he is braced up and standing as close into the wind's eye as he can put his beak. But we'll be sure to overhaul him, or bring him to with a shot.' `Why, is he likely to escape us?' asked the marshal, earnestly. `Not he! But it is a hard chase, dead to windward—and the shallop will, no doubt, lay a point nigher the wind than we can, he is so much lighter and smaller. This will give him a great advantage. But I can bring him to his bearings with a six pound shot.' `I see her now, distinctly, with the naked eye,' said the collector. `It is plainly a small two-masted vessel.' `Had you not better get a gun ready, captain?' This inquiry was made by the chief of police, whose excitement seemed each moment to increase, and who appeared to be very solicitous lest the shallop should, in some mysterious way, give them the slip. `Mr. Waldron, have the larboard bow gun ready to be fired.' `Shall I shot it, sir?' `No, not the first time. But I fancy one gun will be sufficient for him. Stand ready to fire at the order.' `Aye, aye, sir!' answered the lieutenant, going forward to get the gun in readiness to be discharged. We will now return to the shallop. Gordon, who had been sometime at the helm, was just about to resign it to Hugh, the rest of the party being reposing about the deck, asleep—Jennette with her head upon her father's arm, when, as he cast his eyes astern to leward, he discovered a sail. `It would be strange enough, Hugh, if we were pursued,' he said, in the tone of one who felt no apprehension upon the subject. `Let me see what this is. Keep the helm till I look through my glass. We have not seen her before, and she has gained on us, whether in chase or not. I have little fear of pursuit—still, one can't be too cautious.' With these words he went below, and returned with his spy-glass, which he levelled at the strange sail. After examining it a moment, he exclaimed with surprise and alarm, `It is a Revenue Cutter!' `A Cutter? Then she is out after us!' `There is no doubt of it. I saw the cutter at anchor off the town as we run out;— and, be assured, she has been got under weigh and sent in chase of us!' This expression of his opinion roused the colonel from the sleep into which he had fallen under his sense of security, and also started the captain and his daughter from their repose. `Chased, do you say?' exclaimed all three in a breath, as they gathered around Hugh. `I cannot say,' answered Gordon, `but it is a revenue cutter, or small armed schooner.' `Is there danger, Gordon?' whispered Jennette, laying her hand upon her lover's arm. `Do not fear—I will protect you with my life. It may not be any one in pursuit, after all. She steers too far east for us.' `She is luffing, and stands this way,' exclaimed Hugh. `There is now no further doubt of her intentions. She has discovered us, and is beating to windward, after us!' `This is bad news, sir,' said captain Alison to colonel Ogilvie. `I had hoped you were out of danger.' `We must do our best,' cried Hugh, with energy. `We are right opposite Salem, and can run for the shore. It is our only course. In some of the creeks in the main, we can secrete ourselves till it will be safe to put to sea again. Haul aft the fore and main sheets— we must hug the wind as closely as possible.' As he spoke, he brought the shallop up into the wind, and directed her course for the nearest land which the direction of the wind would enable him to reach. There was not a word spoken for some time. Every eye was bent upon the schooner, which could be distinctly made out, less than a mile to leeward. `We have the advantage of her in being to windward,' said Gordon. `Yes, unless she fires.' `And till she fires,' said Captain Alison, `I can hardly believe she is in chase of us,— It seems almost incredible that we should have been followed so promptly, and our track dogged so certainly.' Scarcely had he spoken, ere the sea, in the direction of the schooner, was lighted up by a bright flash, and, the next instant, an instant of painful suspense to all on board the shallop, the dull, booming sound of a gun fell upon their ears. `There is no mistaking her character and business now,' said the colonel. `I am sorry that my fate involves yours, my friends. You had best heave to at once, and let me be given up, rather than incur the danger to which you are exposed by this firing.' `No, no, father—we can save you,' cried Hugh. `We willingly share your peril, sir,' said Gordon. `And Jennette—' `And do not think of me. I am as ready as any of you to incur peril,' she answered, firmly, `so that we can save Colonel Ogilvie.' `And if we give you up, sir, it will be giving ourselves up too, colonel, as abettors in your escape. Our safety is bound up with your own—and we shall yet escape her. The little shallop is fairly flying.' `If they do not load with shot, I shall not care how long they fire,' said Captain Alison. `But the next will be shotted.' `And there it is,' cried Hugh and Gordon, in the same breath. A second bright flash from the schooner, which revealed to them her elegant proportions with the vividness of noon-day, flashed upon their eyes, and then a sharp, dashing noise in the water, just astern of them, showed that ball had been fired. The splash of the shot was followed by the deep voice of the cannon. `That was shotted,' said Hugh, in a low tone. `Lie close to the deck, every one of you. It will be a good gunner that hits us, but it is best you should all be unexposed as much as possible.' The shallop now went bounding on, as if inspired by fear. Anxiously did Gordon and his friend watch the dark line of coast towards which they were stretching. Two lighthouses, near each other, showed them the headlands of the port of Salem, but at least a league and a half distant. `We gain on the land fast,' said Gordon.— `Each moment the outline becomes more and more distinct. If,' he added, in an under tone, `if a shot does not strike us and disable us, we shall reach the shore in half an hour.' `Heaven grant it! Before my father shall be re-taken, I will sink the shallop! At least if this young girl and the rest were not on board. But my father must not be re-taken, Gordon!' `No. There comes another shot. This was a closer one. If they improve this way they will hit us. Have you a small boat?' `Yes—there it is, midships. It will hold us all, if we have to take to it at last.' `Which we must do, if they hit us.' Hardly were the words out of his mouth, when a flash and report were followed by a terrific crashing through the shallop, forward. `The shot has struck us, and we are sinking!' said the old seaman, running aft.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXV. `Now comes our tale to better ending, Than the events foreboded.' `The boat!' cried Gordon, as he heard the sea rushing into the vessel; `let us seek safety in the boat.' As he spoke he caught up Jennette and placing her in her father's arms hastened to assist in launching it. `We must be speedy!' said Hugh, who had hastened forward on hearing the outcry made by the old seaman. `The shot has knocked a hole in her large enough for a man to enter, and the waves are rushing like a cataract into the hold. Our only hope of safety lies in the boat.' In less than a minute and a half from the time the shot struck the shallop between wind and water and stove her bows, they had launched this yawl, placed oars in it and brought it under the gangway. Jennette was first placed in it by Gordon, who then assisted her father and Colonel Ogilvie out of the sinking vessel. Hugh saw his men in and then heaving the vessel to, he lashed the helm and last of all sprung after them, though Cæsar the negro would have been last to cast off. `She will go down in less than ten minutes, sir,' said the old seaman as he took the bow oar. `Give way and let us make as wide a distance between her and the boat as we can, before the schooner comes up.' `And she is rapidly approaching!' said Captain Alison. `She is not more than half a mile to windward.' `She will ceased firing as soon as she discovers that the shallop is hove to, and this will assist us in escaping,' said Gordon. `That was my object in lashing her helm down. Now give way men hearty and strong,' he added to the four oarsmen. We shall reach the main-land in an hour with steady rowing.' `One thing is certain, we escape the schooner by taking to the boat,' said Colonel Ogilvie. `But I am pained that I should be the cause of exposing you all to such discomforts and dangers, especially this fair young girl.' `Do not think of me, sir! I would cheerfully endure greater risks to secure your safety, sir,' answered Jennette earnestly. Hugh had the helm, and while he steered the boat landward, he kept his eyes wondering back to the shallop and the schooner. `The cutter has tacked again and beats rapidly up to the shallop,' he said. `She has discovered that she is hove to and has ceased firing.' `The shallop still swims,' said Gordon. `Yes, she may fill only to her gunwales and then float. They will be disappointed when they board her, to find that their prey has escape. Pull strong and steady, men. Every moment is of value, for it is possible that they may discover even this boat, especially should they throw up a rocket.' `She has hove to! That last shot brought them to their senses,' cried the captain of the cutter, as with his glass he saw the shallop come up into the wind and become stationary. `I thought it surprising,' remarked the marshal with exultation, `that they should dare to keep on under such a fire of shot! But we have them now.' `Ready about!' cried the captain. `We shall fetch her on the other tack.' The schooner now rapidly beat to windward, and soon came abeam of the shallop, which still floated head to the wind. The captain sailed within fifty yards of it and then hailed: `Ho, the shallop.' There was no reply. `They must be all killed!' said the chief of the police. `The shallop ahoy!' repeated the captain in a loud and angry tone. `Send your boat aboard or I'll sink you. `See! What is that! How she rocks!' exclaimed the marshal. `She seems to be leaping into the air!' cried the collector. `What can it mean?' `That is what it means,' answered the captain of the cutter. `She has gone down all standing.' There was a general cry of surprise as they beheld the shallop after a heavy plunge and wide roll or two, descend slowly into the deep and disappear from their eyes. `Out with the boats and save all who float,' cried the lieutenant. `She has been struck and sunk by our shot!' said the captain, `Give way men and look carefully round and see if you can find any body to pick up.' `But nothing but spars and a keg or two were visible on the surface of the sea. The boats were re-called to the cutter and a counsel at once held on deck touching this unlooked for issue. `There is little doubt but that a shot from our guns sunk her, for here is a fresh splinter from a bottom plank, we have picked up,' said the lieutenant. `But there is not so much certainty that her crew went down with her,' said the captain, `How could they have escape?' asked the collector. `In a boat. The fact that we found her lying to when we come up, leads me to believe that she was deserted as soon as she was hit.' `This is likely,' cried the marshal and chief of police in the same breath. `Do you see anything in shore, quarter-master?' asked the collector seeing him looking intently towards the main-land with his glass at his eye. `I see nothing yet, sir. I am trying to make out if any thing is between us and the land! But it is most too dark to distinguish so small an object as a boat.' `Fill away and stand on!' cried the captain. `I see them.' `Where?' `Just in our course close-hauled. We shall come up with them without fail.' But the captain of the cutter was doomed to be disappointed. The object he had detected with his glass proved to be a sunken rock. After beating about the coast, and approaching as near as he dared, until sunrise, and then discovering nothing of any boat with his glass, he gave orders to put away and sail back to Boston. `Without doubt, they all went down with the shallop.' said the marshal, as the cutter began to retrace her course south and westwardly, `I should think so, if she had not been laying to,' answered the captain. My opinion is that as soon as they found her sinking they hove her to, to stop our firing and then took to their boat. It is my belief that they are now snugly concealed somewhere on the shore.' `If I thought so, I would have landed then!' said the marshal. `But as soon as we reach Boston, I will have the alarm given down the coast and if he escaped drowning, he will yet not escape hanging.' The fugitive in the meanwhile having rowed without intermission, reached the mouth of Salem harbor an hour before day. Hugh, to whom the coast was well known, steered directly between the capes and keeping along the banks at day-light, touched the land half a mile below the town. Here they drew up their boat in a secluded inlet and landing, ascended to and entered an unoccupied fisherman's cabin. From an eminence near it, Gordon reported the rchooner just disappearing in the southern board. `Now, that we are in no danger from the cutter, we must guard ourselves against the risks we run by being on shore,' said Hugh. `I have been talking with Blunt here, my old seaman who is a native of Marblehead. He says that if my father will disguise himself as a fisherman, and let his beard grow he will take him in the boat to his own native cabin, which is in a solitary spot near the beach, where he will be secure from all danger of arrest. I shall accompany my father similarly disguised, for I shall not leave him till he is safely out of the county. We start in half an hour, soon as we refresh ourselves with these provisions I threw into the boat! As for you, my dear Gordon, and your friends, I would recommend you to return to Boston, by the first stage. You will not be suspected. No one has seen to recognize you. You will be perfectly secure.' `I have no fears for myself. No one knows or suspects the part which Jennette and I have had in the escape of your father, and had not circumstances compelled us hurriedly to embark as we did, I should not have left the city, Your plan, so far as securing Colonel Ogilvie's safety, is a good one. Blunt seems to be faithful!' `He is to be trusted,' answered Hugh. They then seated themselves around their rude breakfast, which was placed upon a flat stone in front of the hut, as a substitute for a table. After they had finished their meal, Hugh and his father took a grateful leave of their friends, and then embarked with the faithful Cæsar in the boat for the solitary cabin of the fisherman, two leagues up the coast. When they had rowed out of sight behind a projecting rock, Gordon turned to Captain Alison and Jennette. `We are now ourselves out of danger, and Colonel Ogilvie's safety is no doubt secured. He will be safe where he is going. Upon the least alarm he can take to his boat and go out from the land as if for fish, keeping beyond recognition and danger.' `I feel a great load off my mind,' said Captain Alison. `We can't have been suspected! No one who sees us now would suspect us, for the colonel is not with us in company to commit us. Jennette, I breathe again; for ever since we were first chased by their cutter I have been imagining you confined in a prison. But now we are all safe.' `Our first course will be to proceed to the town and obtain a conveyance to Boston,' said Gordon. The same evening the post coach, in which they took passage, stopped with the party of three persons at the toll gate of Charlestown bridge, where they alighted; and thence, in order not to be followed or recognized, they walked to the residence of Gordon, where Jeannette and her father gladly found a refuge, after the exciting events of the two past days. The next day Gordon was privately married to Jennette, with the full approval of his sister Isabel, who had not been long in the society of the lovely sewing-girl, before she became fondly attached to her. Isabel said nothing to her brother about the escape of Colonel Ogilvie, of which she had heard through the public prints, but she was well aware that her brother had been engaged in it; and she half guessed that Jennette, now his sweet bride, had performed the part of the strawberry-girl. The fourth day after the return of Gordon, being alone with his sister, asked her if she still ebjected to Hugh, now that his father had escaped. `He is not less infamous, Gordon,' she answered. `All the world are talking of his escape, and his guilt has been, as it were, doubly sealed by it. Indeed, it will hardly be safe for Hugh to come to Boston again.' `But he can live abroad.' `No, no! I love him—I would gladly become his wife—but I cannot, I cannot sacrifice myself.' While she was speaking the street bell rung and a person came to the door and left a note, to the following purport. Sir:—Call and see me, I am dying, and have a secret of importanc to communicate to you. Parchnip. Attorney, No. — street. To Gordon Hays, Esq. Gordon believing this evil man was about to reveal something in favor of his victim, Colonel Ogilvie, hastened to obey this extraordinary summons. He found the lawyer near his end, having been knocked down and severely crushed, that morning, by a loaded dray. There were two gentlemen in the room when Gordon entered, one of whom he recognized to be the Judge who had sentenced Colonel Ogilvie. `Glad you have come,' said the attorney looking at Gordon with glassy eyes; `you see me dying! Sent for you, knew you friend to Colonel Ogilvie. Don't know whether he is alive or dead. Hope he lives. Sent for you and these gentlemen!—Driver of coach didn't die. Bribed the landlord and doctor to report him dead. Buried an empty coffin. Driver to be found at No.— Street, Baltimore. Send for him. Prove it. Colonel Ogilvie was right in trying to get the papers. They would have ruined his word —bound in honor to protect him. Papers forged. Colonel Ogilvie innocent. No murder done. Ought to be pardoned for stopping mail. An honorable man. That's all I have to say. Couldn't die without telling all! Hope the Colonel's alive. If not it'll do his son good to know this. These gentlemen are witnesses to what I say. I've done. Doctor tells me I shall be dead in an hour! Die happier for making clean breast. This is my true deposition, so help me Heaven!' The amazement of those present and the joy of Gordon may be conceived. The attorney died that night. An officer was despatched to Baltimore and in six days returned with the driver so long supposed dead, but who had been kept out of the way by Parchnip's bribes. The landlord of the tavern was also arrested where the driver was supposed to have died. The fact of his existence being fully established and the substance of Parchnip's confession having been made known to the Governor he proclaimed a full pardon to Colonel Ogilvie. Gordon was the happy bearer of this intelligence to the fisherman's cabin by the sea-side; and the next day after receiving the joyful news, Colonel Ogilvie and Hugh were inmates of Gordon's house in Summer Street. It would be difficult to decide which was the happiest at this propitious issue of events, Hugh or Isabel. She no longer re fused him her hand, and so in one week there were two weddings at Gordon's happy mansion; while Colonel Ogilvie restored to his good name and fortune, blessed in prosperity those who had been such firm friends to him in adversity. Old Captain Alison was rejuvenized, and lame as he was, threw away his crutch and danced at Isabel's wedding like a jolly young sailor of one and twenty. `What a contrast this scene and time; Jennette,' he said with tears glistening in his eyes, as he drew near his daughter's side, during the bridal evening, `to the time three weeks ago, when we knew not where we should get the next piece of bread. But I recollect you told me then that one should never doubt the goodness of Providence.' `And you never will again I know, dear father.' `Never, my child. If we had not been so poor, Cæsar would not have come to visit and aid us, and so Lieutenant Hays, your noble young husband, would not have found us out; and all these happy things would not have come to pass. Even after this, I shall remember that the darkest hour is just before day.' THE END.</field>
