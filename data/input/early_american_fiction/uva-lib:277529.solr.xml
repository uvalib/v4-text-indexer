      <field name="fulltext">B Advertisement, by the Compiler. I have adopted this title, not to set people together by the ears, about the pronunciation; but, because it appeared to me, particularly appropriate. It is, in reality, The Life of Bill Adams; commonly called Neck or Nothing; partly written by himself; and partly, by Hammond the Dwarf; a man, of whom, I know little more than what I have found in these memoirs. Yet, the life of poor Adams, together with all his literary works; some of which, are yet to be found, might have been included in one great table of Errata. He has undertaken, here, I perceive, to tell a story, as much as possible, after his own manner of talking. He was remarkable for his colloquial power—which was full of vivacity and briskness—or force, and solemnity—or sprightliness and familiarity—just as the occasion demanded. I have listened to many good talkers; but to none, that would bear comparison with my unhappy friend.—They always talked in the same style, whatever was the subject; or, however much or little, they were interested in it. But he! I could tell, on entering the house; not to say the room, where William Adams was, by the feeling of the atmosphere; and, by the motion of things about me, whether he were really awake and alive with the subject. The want of arrangement; the incoherency; and the perpetual shifting, from one period of his life to another; with, now and then, a sort of a fiery confusion, which will be found here, were altogether as conspicuous in his conversation. It was a favourite theory of his, that a man should always talk; and by this, he meant, that he should never declaim, or speak; and that, his written language should be altogether colloquial. He execrated what is called classical writing, as wholly artificial and mistaken; and he used to say, that, if a man talked badly, it were better, nevertheless, that he should write, as he talked; than, that he should write classically; for, whatever faults he might have, in the first case, he would have, at least, the redeeming beauty of nature; and, what is natural, though it may, now and then, offend us, will, always, be less offensive than affectation. The want of method, and manifest design, in this tale, which, so far as I can penetrate into the history of his early life, appears to be his own biography, would, deservedly, operate as a fatal objection to it; were it not, that he wrote it, avowedly, for the purpose of showing how people really do talk, in this world of ours; and, with a hope, of putting to shame, in some measure, the cold, artificial beauty of classical writing; interminable periods; interwoven sentences; and, what is called a gradual developement[1] [1] Development—no such word.—Ed. of thought; as if men, when they think at all, have the patience to think gradually; and, as if, what is called a gradual developement of their thought, were not a mere subterfuge to delay the exposure of their own ignorance; and avert the punishment, which they deserve, for attempting to talk at all, without preparation; or the impulse of a full heart, upon any subject, whatever. My friend was right—he went a little too far, perhaps—but, he was right, in the main; and now, that he is gone, I cannot forbear saying, that, although I scorned his doctrine, when it was first explained to me;—yet, I became a convert to it, at last; and that, now, I am fully convinced, that there is a natural outcry, for every thought; as well as a voice, for every passion of the human heart; and that, by tempering it, or qualifying it, when you have occasion to express it upon paper, you counteract the whole purpose of language. “Tamper not with that power;” he used to say to me, when I was trying to talk remarkably well. “You are only dishonouring yourself, and fatiguing me. The faculty of conversation, is the greatest of all our faculties. It is a perpetual miracle. Do not talk at all, until you are master of your subject; and, when you are, give yourself no trouble about the arrangement. Be natural—and you must be eloquent. Get your heart full of the subject, and you cannot help talking well.” “They, who are thought by the world to talk best; always begin to talk, before they begin to think; and proceed so cautiously, qualifying all that they have to say, with such a continual anxiety, that they infallibly tire you out. You know not, to be sure, what to complain of, after you have left them; and, perhaps, if you knew, have not the courage to mention it; all that you know is, that they have been quite too classical for your patience; for, who could endure an essay, in conversation? Nay—if men were honest, I would ask them, who could endure an essay any where, if his taste were not first perverted? My notion is, that all publick speaking; and all written language, are but the imperfect imitation of talking; and that, the nearer they approach to it; the more beautiful and powerful is their operation, upon the heart of man.” “Why is it,” he continued, after a short pause, “that men, of great excellence in conversation, are unable to write; or to speak, in publick; and that they, who are equally remarkable for their fluency and promptitude, while addressing a publick assembly, have often no colloquial power at all; and are unable, frequently, to write a tolerable letter; while others, who can write rapidly and easily, cannot speak?” “Chiefly,” said I (for I had thought a good deal on the subject, and was willing to be master of it) chiefly, I apprehend, for the following reasons. In the first place, no man will be remarkable for talking; or writing; or speaking well; unless he give his undivided attention; together with his whole heart and soul, to some one, alone, of the three miraculous accomplishments. In proportion as he is distinguished, therefore, for the one, or the other, will be his probable inferiority in the other two. Few men are great, for more than one thing. And, although they be respectable in others; yet will they appear deficient in them, by comparison, not with other men, but, with themselves. A great writer may have occasion to address a popular assembly; and he may acquit himself so, that, had any other man done as well, it would have been an honour to him; and yet, so much being expected of him, as a great man, he may disgrace himself forever. Another reason is, that different faculties are required for speaking, and for writing well. The speaker, in his hurry and impetuosity, carries you away with him; his path is illuminated by incessant irradiations—he—” “What!” said my friend, interrupting me, with an austere expression. “I beg your pardon, but, we will talk this matter over, if you please—”. I felt a little abashed, I confess, for a moment; but recovered myself, immediately; and proceeded, somewhat in the following fashion. “A speaker can always explain and qualify what he has said, if he see, by the expression of the faces about him, that he has gone too far; or, not far enough. By giving way to his passion, he can suspend your faculties of criticism; and, in a large company, whose elbows are all thrilling together, he may work himself, and them, into a phrenzy, beyond all that any mere writer can conceive. Will such a man, think you, at the height of his reputation, put it all at hazard, by entering the place of gladiators; the tilting ground of literature?—the—” “Pshaw!—” cried my friend. “And, if he should,” said I, laughing at his impatience, “how would he contrive to manage his own thought? It would all run to waste, while he was contriving a channel for it—nay, don't be angry, I must talk in this way, if I talk at all—it is natural to me— If I feel what I am saying, my illustration and my argument flow together in two parallel streams.” A deep sigh was the only notice taken, of what I said; and I continued. “A very rapid writer cannot express himself so gracefully, or so fluently, if he have a bad pen, or greasy paper. Copy what he has written; and one, that knows him, will deny its authenticity. And why? Because, before he can finish a sentence, he had leisure to turn it over, so often in his mind, that he was tired of it. He kept continually changing word after word, as he proceeded; until, at last, there was no unity in what he had written;—the latter part contradicted; or, at least, did not tally with the former part of the sentence. B 2 He had rejected all those natural superfluities of expression, which are the life and soul of conversation. He had endeavoured, as a letter-writer, that I once knew, did, to say what he had to say, in the fewest possible words; and, in the shortest possible time; as if letter writing and conversation were not different things from an epigram, or a syllogism; a problem or an enigma. To apply this. The speaker, when he comes to write, is in a situation altogether worse, than the rapid writer, who has fallen upon bad pens, and greasy paper. It is more, as if the latter were obliged to write with his left hand. You smile—what do you think of my doctrine?” “Tolerably well. Mine, however, is more simple; and will supply several deficiencies in it. If men would condescend to talk—in every situation, they would soon find it no difficult matter to talk well. But they will not. The talker will speak, when he stands up; and, when he sits down to write, he must be—what God never meant any honest man to be—a classical writer. If a man would only have the courage, while he is writing, to finish the sentence—that first occurred to him, as he first conceived it; it would always have a natural charm about it, however inelegant; nor would it be inelegant, if he had any talent for talking. But enough of this. I have no leisure, at present, to demonstrate my system. I am right. Let that satisfy you. I am right; and I know it. I have already adapted a method of proving it; and (his eye glanced to a little black trunk, in which, I found a large quantity of manuscript after his death) if it be permitted to me, to live a few years longer, it shall go hard with me, but I will effect a revolution in the publick taste.” I smiled at his vanity, and he saw it; but it gave him no trouble. He believed what he said, I am sure. I have detailed this conversation with scrupulous fidelity, because I have felt it to be a matter of duty, to the memory of my unhappy friend. Those that knew him well, as I did, cannot deny, that, if he had chosen to be methodical, he was well fitted, by perseverance and constitution, to be distinguished for method;—and that, the rambling of his heart through these volumes, so precisely after his manner of conversation, which Mr. Hammond used to characterise very happily, I have heard, as “a perpetual digression,” is altogether owing to design; and that, all his late productions had a scope and purpose in them—a steadiness and unity—far more serious, than were ever attributed to them, at the time; nothing less, I believe, now, than to effect a revolution in the literary taste of the age. Preposterous and wild, as an ambition like that, may be deemed; yet, if Truth and Nature were, as he maintained, upon his side, he must have prevailed, at last. When the papers were put into my hands, I found, at the top of them, a sheet carefully folded, with the word Preface upon it; and, when I had leisure to arrange the whole for publication, I opened it;—and, after some consideration, adopted it, as a better view of the whole matter, by far, than I could attempt to give. It was in the hand-writing of Adams, himself; or, rather, of him that I have chosen to call Adams—for it will not be expected, I hope, that my name should be real;—and it ran in the following language:—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. I have written this tale, for the purpose of showing how people talk, when they are not talking for display; when they are telling a story of themselves, familiarly; seated about their own fireside; with a plenty of apples and cider; in the depth of winter—with all their family, and one or two pleasant strangers, lolling about; and the great house dog with his nose in the ashes; or out under the green trees, on a fine summer night; with all the faces, that they love, coming and going, like shadows, under the beautiful dim trees; and the red sky shining through them. Reader—have you ever stood, with your hat in your hand, to look at a little dreamy light made by the moonshine, where it fell through the green leaves; and “fermented” in the wet turf?—or the starlight and water bubbles dancing together, under the willow trees?—If you have, then you may form some notion of what I mean, by my love of Nature. Men go by her blossoming places, every hour, and never see them; her singing places, while there is a wedding in the grass; and trample upon them, without one thought of their beauty; and just so with the delicate beauties of conversation. They see nothing, hear nothing, until their attention be called to it. But they go out, where it is the fashion to be sentimental; and persuade themselves that their artificial rapture is the natural offspring, of a warm heart, and a pure taste. Pshaw!—people that do not love fine conversation, and fine reading, beyond fine speaking and fine singing, have neither understanding nor taste. I have attempted, in this novel, that kind of colloquial manner, which is natural to the impassioned and adventurous; fervid; varied; and abrupt. I mention this, that however, you may condemn my judgment, you shall not charge me with failing in my design. The first I can bear—but the latter I cannot. Understand my plan; and blame me for having adopted it, if you please; but have the decency, I pray you, to admit that I have done, what I have undertaken. Another thing that I have attempted, (let others determine, whether I have succeeded, or not,) was to continue the interest of my story, after the catastrophe, or, what is commonly called, the marriage of the heroine, had taken place; and another, was to show that deformity of person does not, of necessity, imply deformity of heart; and that a Dwarf, in stature, may be a giant in blood: and another (if the ladies and angels will forgive me) was to represent the angels of the earth, pretty much as they are, frail and accessible, in general, like the “women of the sky.” How they may like this, accustomed as they are, to being called spiritualities, while they are treated as altogether sensual, I am not prepared to say. The wise, who have been in danger, and are able to judge of it, are always indulgent to them, that distrust the miraculous purity and strength, of the untried, and untempted. Of the hero, I have little to say. That such a man once lived; that I knew him, personally; and that he was, in all the leading properties of his nature, what I have described him to be, I have no disposition to deny;—nay, that he lives yet; but that he cannot live long, I will add, for the satisfaction of them, that love to trouble themselves about what is none of their business. “There is the picture of my life,” said he once, while we sat together on a bleak December night, ruminating, over the accumulated dust and ashes of a sea coal fire, upon the changes, that, we and all the elements about us, were continually undergoing. “There it is!” (pointing with his cane as he proceeded, to different features of the imaginary landscape, until I saw them as plainly as he.) “This bleak and desolate place—with only this one, barren, and leafless tree, within the whole circumference of the horizon—its aged branches heavy with snow and ice—standing alone, as it were in the place of graves.” I followed the blackened point of the cane, as it successively touched along the larger pieces of burnt coal; and disturbed the white ashes, that lay, here and there, upon the larger cinders, like snow upon the rocks and hedges of a wintry landscape. “I can see the interminable blue ocean beyond;” he continued, “and just there,” (drawing, a line from left to right, across the whole hearth; and making a round hole upon it—where you can perceive the sun setting— one half already below the horizon—the upper part already darkened by these heavy clouds (cutting a flourish over the hole in the ashes, that I have already mentioned)—the only light that is left, my dear friend, you perceive, falls directly upon this poor, worn tree—but alas, where does it touch?—Look!—the last sunshine is upon its old heart, crumbling in the wind:— and see!—here, a few faint rays have escaped; and are just touching—look here, my friend, tell me if you can make this out?” I shook my head; for I could see only a handful of trodden and crushed cinders. “Well, well—it matters little. I will help you to understand it. I am about to die. I feel it. I know it—but I dare not think of it; if I do, it will drive me raving mad. Very well—let us proceed. These are tomb-stones, broken and lying about; that one, which is leaning against the old tree, is my own. Behold—it is mouldering and falling, with its own weight. There is just light enough, you perceive, to read the inscription. Can you read it? It is the name of your friend —this grave here, is newly dug—those hills, that you see—of ice and snow—away to your left—are the Glaciers—that Ocean is eternity. The grave is my own. Let this be the inscription upon it— The sun had gone down upon his heart.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">C CHAPTER I. Character...Pedigree... My Father...Fidele...My Uncle...My Mother...Her death...Discipline...Incidents...Death of Fidele ...Reflections...Death of my little brother...Adventure. If there ever was a coward upon earth, I am one. If God ever made a thing so contemptible, I was born one. From my earliest recollection of myself, the very name of death was frightful to me: and, when I came to understand what it meant; and to see how it fastened upon whatever I happened to love, so invisibly, yet so fatally; how it altered whatever it touched, till every body fled from it, even the mother from her babe; how it affected the voices of men, when they spoke of it —I began to feel—I hardly know how, toward it—it was not as other children felt; not, as if death were a shadow, or a power, the common enemy of our race—but, I hated it with a bitterness and earnestness—and feared it, with a fear, that kept my blood in a continual agitation—as if it were a real, living creature; and my own particular, deadly enemy. Nay, even now, with all my experience, and discipline; notwithstanding all that I have encountered, and suffered, in the hope of overcoming this weakness of my nature; it is a fact, that the very thought of death, when I am alone, is enough to drive me distracted. And yet—my whole life has been one scene of uninterrupted adventure; often very desperate and wild; and always voluntary. How is that contradiction to be reconciled? Many a time, have I done that, from which other boys would have started back with terrour; and then, when it was all over; and I was alone, and safe at home, in my own bed; I have covered up my head in the clothes, and lain there, with my teeth chattering; or my hair wet with perspiration, for hours together. How are these things to be accounted for? Who can tell me?—I am afraid of death; so piteously afraid of it, that, even now, while I am writing about it, I can feel a convulsion in my throat; and a coldness about my mouth, which, in my boyhood, was the sure forerunner of a frightful paroxysm: and yet!—how will ye account for it!—Ye men, that pretend to explore the infinite recesses of the living human heart, as ye would search into a lump of morbid anatomy; and to trace the thought thereof; and the motive; through all their invisible ramifications, with as much certainty, at least, as ye would, the source of life, through all the labyrinth of nerves and blood-vessels, with electricity or galvanism—tell me! how will ye explain these everlasting phenomena in my nature! Will ye tell me, that, when danger and darkness have been upon me; and silence round about me, I have continually shut up my senses, with the desperation of fear; and plunged, headlong, upon every confronting peril— like the cowardly creatures of the desert, and the wilderness; who, when they are beset on all sides—are sure to turn upon their enemies, with tenfold greater effect, than they, that are naturally brave, and go quietly abroad over the mountains--openly--in the full light of heaven? Will ye tell me that the same law prevails with the bird and the beast, throughout all creation? Will ye point me to the female and her young? Men—ye are darkening counsel, by words without wisdom. I tell you—that I have done this, when I had no young to guard—nothing on earth to care for; and with my senses all a wake; and excited to inconceivable activity; when it was neither dark, nor silent about me—when I was neither blind nor deaf— —nor desperate with passion—nor in any danger—nor, in any degree, insensible to the true character of the peril, which I had to encounter;—nay, that, when I have done these things, it has generally been, with a calmer eye, and a steadier hand—and when the danger was multiplied and aggravated—infinitely—by my natural cowardice. Can ye read me the riddle now! No. Then, follow me, while I become so intensely engaged, in the plain narrative of my life, that I shall forget the aspect of Death; and grow insensible to the influence of my dastardly nature; and ye will then behold—a picture it may be— of many a human heart, that ye have mistaken for a brave one—a true picture, it may be, of your own. I was born in New England, at a little village near Boston. I was christened; or, rather called Ichabod Adams; but I did'nt like the name, and would not answer to it, although it underwent a variety of spiteful or gentle transmutations, among my mischievous play fellows, and the good natured people about. But, all would'nt do; I detested Ika—and Ikaby—and Iky— just as heartily as I did Ichabod. At last, an uncle, on the side of my mother, with whom I had been a favourite; deceased, as they say in New England; and left me, among a number of fine things, which I didn't get, (the watch being given to one of my brothers; and some books to my sister,) two, that I did get—to wit—his christian name, and a silver mounted riding whip; which, having taken a great fancy to, I had stolen so often; and so adroitly, that my uncle, in despair, gave up the hope of keeping it, I dare say. From that time, I was called William Adams—Will Adams—Billy Adams—or Willy, or Bill, just as the person who called me, happened to have more or less authority over me; until, at last, there was a particular name; which, like a particular look, gesture, or tone of voice, before which, you may see a child, or a beast, crouch, even though he have never seen, or heard it before; which always prepared me for a whipping; and which I never heard, if I could help it. It was remarked too; but I do not vouch for the truth of it, that there were certain seasons of the year, when, all names were alike to me; when I was deaf, as an adder; and, some how or other, if I may trust to tradition, among the families that yet remain in that neighbourhood, this deafness was more particularly evident, in the day time, about school-hours; and, in the morning, about the time, when people ought to get up, in the country; or, in the evening, when the family, as they used to, in old times, had assembled together for prayer; or to read a chapter in the Bible. And so too, they have it, that, about the time when the wild strawberries were ripe; or the raspberries; or black-berries; or the sweet apples began to lie about, baking under the trees, and ripening in the hot sunshine; or the cucumbers were of that dark green colour—prickly and crisp—when the country boys are found, under the stone walls—each with his hand full of salt—and something in his other hand, that he never takes a bite of, without first looking all about him;—or the water-melon patches; the young turnip field; and musk-melon plantings were in their glory—or the green corn in the milk— that my deafness would become unspeakably obstinate; so much so, indeed, that, often and often, the people, who had been sent for me, through interminable fields of tall corn; bawling after me, at every step; and cracking a horse-whip, it may be, like a pistol, all the way, —have actually, on more than one occasion, stumbled over me, as I lay, sleeping in the grass, before they have been able to make me hear. And then, would'nt I get it!—Zounds, I can hear that cursed old riding whip, cracking away, now—and see it, too!—whenever I stop writing, and lift up my head from the paper— although it is a long while ago—and I am nearly blind, as well as deaf. But, even this name, Bill Adams, did'nt last me long. Before I was fourteen; far and near, wherever a salmon was to be caught, a shad, or a mackerel; or whenever a raising, or a quilting, a husking, or a sleighing was in the wind, I was known by the name of Neck or Nothing. That name, however, sticks to me yet. I am still, Neck or Nothing; and, not long ago, when I first returned to my native village, after a long life, spent among strangers and in foreign lands; and found our old house in ruins—thistles and burdock, literally growing out of the fissures, in the great hearth-stone; over which, I had assisted so often, in rolling a single back-log; which, in these times, would be fuel enough C 2 for a week, in a common fire-place; and there, when I stood, and looked at the old chimney, with the blue clay, falling out of every crevice, at every blast of the wind, till my heart was in my throat; and I could have knelt down, even where I stood, and cried like a child; even then, and there—when my whole name and family were extinct; and I was like an outcast among men— aye, more like a brute beast, cowering for shelter among obscene rubbish, than a prodigal son, as I was, returned to the house of my father, that he might have compassion on me—even there, did my stunned heart leap in my bosom; when some one, an old man, who had been looking at me for some time, let his crutch fall, and cried out, in a broken, tremulous voice, “Neck or Nothin!—as I'm a livin' critter!” Ah, my friend—whoever you are, that are now reading this manuscript, I cannot tell you what followed; or, how foolish I was, while standing within the four walls of my father's house; overgrown, as I have already told you, that it was, by the frightful greenness of desolation; and blackened with the vestiges of fire, (for I learnt from the old man, that it was burnt by lighting) when I heard that well remembered name of my boyhood. Upon my word, whatever you may think of it, I felt no disposition to smile; I could rather have cried heartily. The name went through my heart, as if my father had spoken to me, out of the ground. So—Let us leave this part of my narrative. It is but of the other day—and I do not so distinctly remember the circumstances, as I do those of my childhood. But, before I forget it; I would mention that the old man told me all about the destruction of the family; although, I have nearly forgotten it; for, I remember nothing, but the place under the great apple tree, where, he told me that my father—my father; yes, I believe it was my father; was buried. I am strangely bewildered. Things of yesterday, some how or other, appear to me, as if they had never been; and yet, all that happened to me in my childhood, I can remember, as if they were but the other day—as if it were a little time only—since I went tumbling about, under the currant bushes; or, in the dark wood, half buried in great white flowers, and purple blossoms: “Where the wild grape hangs, dropping in the shade, “O'er unfledged minstrels, that beneath are laid. And yet, I am not old—not very old; other men, at my age, are hardly in their prime. Why is it, then, that I am so troubled with faintness and giddiness of heart? And why is it, that my memory can no longer be depended upon? But—to the narrative. Let me tell you who my father was. I remember him well. He was a little, fat, positive old man; of uncommon personal strength; and more obstinacy of temper, than any other mortal—except myself, perhaps—that ever lived. At one time— but the very time, I disremember, (as they say in Maryland)—he was a follower of George Fox, the quaker. But, happening to see a woman that he liked, he visited her; and, because the quakers, at Lynn, took it into their heads that he was courting her, (not a thought of which had ever entered into his head, at that time, I verily believe)—and undertook to interfere, and advise, and deal with him, as they call it; and prevent him, if they could—he married her. He was always the first to take the bull by the horns. After the committee, that they sent to him, had set awhile, in silence; groaning a little, now and then; he asked them what was the matter? and what they wanted?—They told him, in rather a round-about way; and there the matter ended. They left him, I am told, when the sun was about two hours high. That very day, before candle light, my father was a married man. Three weeks from that time, he was turned out of meeting;—and, before the honey moon was over, he was a tavern-keeper; a justice of the peace; a Selectman; a Deacon in another church; a store keeper; and a militia captain; and had killed an Indian, with his own hand, in the orchard, back of the house—on a sabbath day, too—while all the people were at church; the rest, with their loaded guns lying before them, on the rough board-benches.—From that day, he became the most active and formidable enemy, that the followers of George Fox ever had. My father, among other matters, prided himself on never having abandoned an argument; on never having learned a trade; on never having been mistaken, in all his life; and on being able “to turn his hand to anything”. Still, there were some points in his character, that I could never fully understand. He became a rigid, inflexible Presbyterian; for, he was never the man to go half way, in anything that he undertook; and yet, there seemed to be a secret yearning, for a long time, in his disposition, toward the early habits of quaker discipline; which betrayed itself continually; and, sometimes, rather laughably, I remember, when he was in a passion, or taken by surprise. Thus, he would thee and thou the soldiers, under his command; and damn their cowardly souls to hell, in the same breath; and then, suddenly draw up—begin to pray aloud, at the head of his company—and forget to take his hat off. I, myself, have seen him guilty of such things as these —and one of them, I distinctly remember. General Horton came to see him, one day.—My father first took his heavy saddlebags over his arm; then, made him a low bow; and then, called him by his christian name—a few minutes after that, in the capacity of a tavern-keeper, he began to curry the general's horse; and then, recollecting who he was, he drew up, pompously, before the general, with all the air of a justice of the peace—cut a solemn flourish, which he meant to be a military salute, with a yard-stick, that he had in his hand—(while one customer was bawling to him, from the shop door, for some “truck for trowsers,” and another, from the tavern window, for some new laid eggs, for breakfast) and concluded, Jim Butler says, though I did not see that, with rolling up his eyes, and a deep groan, like a church warden.—Allowing a little for exaggeration, I assure you, that the various occupations, of my father, were continually subjecting him to trials, which were quite as amusing in their consequences, if not precisely the same, as I have described. Yet—let me not be unjust to the good old man. He had some conscience; and not only used to permit the children, and his wife too, when she pleased, which was, whenever she had anything new to wear—or, whenever she had heard of anything new, that another had, to go to quaker meeting at Lynn, or Marblehead; but would frequently amuse himself and us, for a whole evening together, talking quaker, as he called it; until the plain language became like our mother tongue to us. He spoke it, remarkably well; better, by far, than any of our neighbours; and, for that reason; and because he was better educated than they, his downfall and exclusion from society, had been predicted for many a year. The truth is, I believe, (I say that I believe, because my father would never permit us to ask any questions about his family;) the truth is, I am afraid, that he was a wicked fellow, among the women—at least, when he was a young man. He was an Englishman too; and well educated, for the times, although there was a good deal of mystery about his early life. My father had a large family, as long ago, as I can remember; and, being, at one time, orthodox to a proverb; and related to one, who in the early religious broils of Massachusetts Bay, I have heard him say, had suffered much persecution; he held it to be his religious duty to perpetuate the feud, by all legitimate means; and to keep alive the recollection of what had been done and said, by his ancestry, for the last hundred years; by any means whatever, whether legitimate or not. For this reason, it was, that our family, males and females continued, generation, after generation, to appropriate to themselves certain outlandish names; which whenever they had to mingle with the world, became a source of continual mortification and embarrassment; long and long after a more rational practice had been established in our very neighbourhood. I was originally called Ichabod, as I have already mentioned; but soon came to be known, altogether, even at home, by my nick names of Bill; Will; and Neck or Nothing. My elder brother was christened Jonathan; my second Moses—my third Sampson Achilles, which by corruption, became Samy Kelly;—my youngest, Benjamin—my eldest sister, Thankful; my next, Comfort; my third, Charity, till the death of my mother; and then, Catharine Elizabeth, partly out of spite too, I believe in my heart, to the quakers. And, as my father was mightily addicted to the scriptures; there is no knowing how many other names, he might have added to each individual, had not my mother hinted to him, in her simplicity; that, if he were not frugal, the family vocabulary might be exhausted. My father, I am told, was considerably frightened; for such a thing as a new name, in his family, was about as rare an innovation as a new creed; and my mother bred like a rabbit. Let my father have his own way, and he was one of the best tempered men in the world; but obstinate as the devil; and exceedingly perverse, as I have felt it my duty to acknowledge to him, many and many a time, when he could'nt have it. And though he would growl a little, now and then, about the sinfulness of neighbour Obadiah Stephens, and Deacon Sammy Shipwell; his spiritual associates in the church government; and drink hard cider, till he could'nt see out of his eyes;— and get what he could, out of the Egyptians and the Philistines, as he called all the rest of the world, for his tin ware and sugar-boxes; justifying himself by the example of the Israelites;—yet no man reprobated scandal, and back-biting; cheating and intemperance, more heartily, or devoutly, than he. He knew every one, by name, that was guilty of either, in any degree, within a circle of ten miles round; and, at a proper place, and time; such as prayer-meetings, lectures, raisings, and love feasts, no man made better use of his knowledge —or was less niggardly of his admonition to the offender. In family and church government, he was alike orthodox and absolute; as all our backs can testify. But, among his peculiarities, there were some touches of character, which, under different circumstances, might have made him conspicuous for other things; for, puritanical as he was, in most matters, I remember well that, if he got his head once wrong, even about church matters, all creation could'nt set it right. Thus he would never permit a child of his, to be christened till it was one year old. This, to the truly orthodox, was truly awful. They remonstrated—he was mute: —they charged him with the infant's soul—he nodded— they asked him what the—goodness—he meant? To which, I have been told, that he replied, something after this fashion. “Neighbours, you be dammed!— don't be worrying yeselves, about me. I want none o' your meddlin. That for the boy's soul! (snapping his fingers,) I shan't go the expense of christenin, till I see some probability of his livin: and I think it much more fatherly to keep a fresh born babe, well wrapped up; warm and snug, at home; by a roarin fire, though he should happen to go to heaven without a name; than to carry the little toad, half a dozen miles, to a cold church; and show his little parboiled face, pimpled and mottled all over, like the rump of a picked chicken, for four or five hours together, to a congregation, who can't, with all their zeal, keep their jaws from chattering together, like the cogs of a water mill:—beside all that, I don't choose to give my child a name, till I know something of his character. He may be a David; or a Solomon; or a Judas; and I would'nt make him ridiculous, while it was decent to avoid it.” The conference ended; and the committee returned in silence; walking, leisurely, through the principal street, one after the other, that the publick might he moved to enquire where they had been; and what had been the nature of their dealing with Deacon Adams; and, peradventure, that they might be led into an interpretation of their long faces, each man, according to the wishes of his own heart. Howbeit, from that day Deacon Adams began to be regarded, as a worldly minded man; not to be moved by the brethren having authority; and as one profanely snapping his fingers at a future state. Some of my earlier years had gone by, almost without my knowing my own age, when something happened to make an altered boy of me. My poor mother died. I loved my mother—I loved her, a thousand times more, I believe; because, for a long time, I had nothing else to love. Yet, the only distinct recollection that I have of her, is, that she was a sickly looking woman, who grew surprisingly fat, once a year, at least—in a manner, that was perfectly unaccountable to me—at that time;—with a mild, pleasant face; and large hazle eyes, I believe; for I have seen large eyes of that colour since, which looked at me, as my mother's did, when she loved me. When my father chose to whip me; my mother, I remember, was very sure to interfere, right or wrong: and, if she could not beg me off; nor hide me; nor get me a qualified flogging; I was pretty sure to get a double allowance of Indian pudding—pumpkin pies; or pudding and molasses—or apple-dowdy—with a plenty of sweetning at the very next meal. She used to sit and cry over me, too, for hours together, when I was very little; thereby teaching me to love her, and hate my father, for his cruelty to both of us;—to me, for whipping me, when I deserved it; and to her, for not letting me off, whenever she chose to beg it of him: and nourishing, thereby, in me, a brave and rebellious disposition, that, in time, made war upon all authority, and—but no matter now. She died.— Aye—and when I stole into the chamber at night, and crept into her bosom, and felt how cold it was; and tried to pull her little hands apart; for they were locked firmly together, upon her breast; and cramped, as I thought, with the cold—for I had no true notion of death—she was so frightfully still and white, that I began to shriek; and I never left her, till I rolled off the bed, in convulsions; for which, by the way, I was nicely whipped, as they say in New-England, on the spot. Then—then, knew I well what death was!—but not till then; for there she lay; and my cruel father, gracious heaven! that men should have no feeling for their own flesh and blood—he whipped me, at the bed side of my poor dead mother, until I foamed at the mouth; and she,— ah, she never raised her hand, nor uttered a single moan. Then knew I, that she was dead. And then, began that horrour of death in me, which no reasoning; no experience; no discipline; no determination; will ever overcome! Lord have compassion upon me! It will make me desperate, yet. It is the secret of all my suffering, and all my transgression. Well, they buried her at last; and I ran away, and lost myself in the great wood; for there was nobody else in all the world, I thought, to love me. But they found me, and whipped me again. I would'nt eat; and they whipped me. I cried in my sleep; and they whipped me. If I went to school, I was whipped; and if I staid away, I was whipped. Whipping was the sovereign specifick. Happen what would—a broken head, or a flogging—no appetite—or a torn jacket—a belly ache—or a sore heart—it was all the same—I was infallibly whipped. Very well.—My mother died, just when I began to find life tolerable. And so it has been through all my days. Whatever has been kind to me, something has always happened to, till nobody, at last, had the courage to be kind to me. And whatever I have made dear to me, even that has become a mark for sorrow and buffetting, all my life long; until I have learnt to tremble and avert my face, if any beautiful apparition came very near to me; or looked out, with a pleasant countenance, from the dreamy darkness and dreariness that have altogether encompassed me, from that day to this. Both have been, but the harbingers of suffering and sorrow. And while I have waxed older and stronger, among the population of the earth, I have learnt to feel more cheerfully, when a frowning and bad face hath gone by me; or a malignant lip curled and writhed at me, though it touched mine, at the very moment, much more cheerfully, than when blessed eyes have been upturned to me; and sweet, distant voices have been singing faintly in the uninhabited caverns of my heart. Alas—it is too true. I have seen and heard both.— The dark and terrifying have aroused me to do battle with them. The beautiful have only soothed me into brief delirium:—out of which, I have started, as from D a trance, spoiled of my armour, and naked to the arrows of all the world. There were beautiful eyes, even in my boyhood, that were shut up, and darkened forever, because of their love for me: and now, all my life long, go whither I will, I can hear the continual melancholy chiding of a broken-hearted girl, that I loved, in my manhood—like the murmur of the green wood; or the summer ocean; or the swift, far sky, when you lie half asleep, in the moonlight, watching the blue heaven, while it rolls away from you;—coming up on one side of the earth; and going down on the other, till, over your head, and under your feet—and on every side of you, there is a continual motion and glitter; within and without you, too, as if you were breathing an atmosphere of starlight. My mother lived just long enough, after I began to love her, to give birth to Jeremiah, the flower of the whole family, he thinks, and perhaps truly; for he is a very tall man, with large, sparkling eyes; white hands—the prettiest teeth in the world—a great favourite of the ladies—and a most accomplished penman—upon my word he is. After she was buried, I began to look about me for something else to love, though it were only a cat or a dog: I cared not; except that, be it what it might, it were death to it, to be a favorite of mine. I was a melancholy, stupid boy, I am told; for never a tear, nor a cry escaped me, under all their laceration;— not a groan, though they mocked at me, and scourged me to the bones—except on one occasion (which I remember well)—when my poor little puppy Fidele, that I had saved once from drowning, at the hazard of my life, was nearly crushed to death by a wagon wheel, which he attacked, for having hurt me, while I was playing in the street. Accursed be the wretch that finally murdered him!—I care not who it was, though it were my own father, or Sammy Kelly, himself,---that malicious little imp. It almost broke my heart. There lay poor Fidele—there the poor fellow lay, half buried in the sea weed, which was all wrapped, round and round his two fore paws; just as if he had been struggling, and swimming a long while, at the length of the rope, from the bottom. He was the strongest little creature!—but, there he lay!—washed up on the beach, among the drift wood; and shells; and white ridges of sand, with a great stone about his neck, and a rope almost gnawed off, in two or three places—so that he must have been a long while a dying. He was dragged up there, by the villain that murdered him— I dare say—by Sammy Kelly himself, if it was he—that I might see it. Who did it, I never knew; and it was well that I did not know; for, when I found the poor dog, with his head cut open; and the white silky hair, so beautiful and soft, as it used to be, all dragged in the blood and dirt—had I known who it was; and had I been strong enough, I would have gone after him, to the ends of the earth; and dragged him to the first water; and strangled him, in it—or driven him into it, with the same stone about his neck—and when he rose, and gasped—and struggled—and his bright hair was floating on the water—(for Sammy Kelly's hair was beautiful—it was of a bright gold colour, and there was half a bushel of it—at least—and people used to come and feel of it; and talk about it, ugly and hateful as the little imp was—hump-backed and mis-shapen all over) I would have hurled stones at his head, till the salt water reddened with his blood—and be damned to him— Poor Fidele. Here was another dead creature that I loved. What was I to think? What had I done, that death would not let me alone? My heart turned cold within me—I had a strangling sensation in my throat—a temporary blindness fell upon me—the roaring of the sea sounded fainter and fainter in my ears—and I felt as if some great invisible creature were trying to stifle me, while I lay—half buried in the sand—with poor Fidele in my bosom—his long soft ears against my bare neck—but I did'nt care, though he did stifle me; and there I lay, in spite of him, till I had cried myself asleep. I know not how long I lay there; but, another tide; a few more waves, would have washed us both away, together— Would God that they had! But my father found me; and, weary of watching a creature, that he regarded as a downright idiot, who had'nt the sense to bawl out, when he was flogged—and yet, would cry himself blind, over a dead dog—he passed all his right and title to lacerate my flesh; and trample on my spirit, over to a great raw-boned uncle of mine—a butcher; with leave, (for my uncle was a melancholy man; and a little change of this nature, might go far to keep up his spirits)—with leave to try his cowhide upon me; for the riding-whip was worn out, whenever he was inclined to the blues. He was an amiable man—that butchering uncle of mine; and his wife, too—you can have no idea of her gentleness; at least, I have not; and I lived in her family for seven long years—and served out an apprenticeship there, to whipping, shame, and torture. Let me relate some of my experiences. I was a sad boy. There is no denying that; and I had been belaboured, from pillar to post, from the time that I was taken out of petticoats, in spite of myself, until I was almost big enough to go into them again, in spite of other people—through all the schools of the district; and not a creature could be found to undertake my education. My dear, dear aunt, had a pleasant way, however, when I did get into any school, of determining, at once, whether I had played truant, or not. “Willy!—come here, Willy!” she would say—“Come to me, directly.” I would go, and stand before her, with my fists doubled. “Let me look at your hands.” It was all that she would take the trouble to say. She never asked if I had been to school; or what I had learnt; or who was there; because that might tempt me to tell a lie; and the devil, himself, was no match for me, at that. So, I would open my hands. If they were not blistered, or red and swollen; she knew that I had played truant; and I was turned over to her husband, for a cowhiding. She was generally right. In this way, I learnt to regard a smart feruling, at school, as quite a comfortable thing; and, lest I should get skinned all over, at home, by my uncle, I took especial care to provoke the master, by some of my pranks, to skin my hands, before I left him. To be sure, I was flogged, sometimes, when I did not deserve it—but I escaped oftener when I did deserve it. This would happen about once a week; for I soon learned to hold their tyranny in such abhorrence, that I compounded with my scruples, at one whipping a week; and then, staining my hands with sumach berries, when I could get them; or red ink, before I went home. My uncle did this flogging in a very workmanlike manner; owing, it may be, to the fact, that he had a large family, of ten or a dozen devils, without including my aunt—for whom, I continue to feel no common respect—and upon whom—but no, I cannot permit myself to tattle of family matters, or slander so affectionate a couple. He had some whimsical notions, too, I remember, about the manner of scourging. Like Doctor Sangrado, bleeding was a sovereign remedy with him; but then, Doctor Sangrado operated with a lancet—and was foolish enough to use warm water also. But the process of my uncle, was much less timid, and abundantly more simple. He bled with a cowhide, at arm's length—and cared little about veins and arteries; and measured the blood—not by bason's-full, or ounces— but by shoe's-full. Verily, that uncle of mine, had a facetious way with him; and his nephew, long and long afterward, profited by his pleasantries, to such an extent that—but, no matter;—the tale of vengeance and retaliation is not for to-night. Since then, I have been to Spain; and Italy; and among the wild Arabs:—and I have had the good fortune to see some clumsy work of the same kind, got up in the Portuguese inquisition; but the contrivances of my uncle were altogether superiour. There, when half a dozen muscular fellows were tugging away, at the heart strings of a poor devil, upon the rack; there was always D 2 a kind hearted gentleman at hand, to tell them when they might lie by, awhile—“for what is the use of worrying yourselves with a dead body?” he would say. “It is insensible, now—rest yourselves a little—wipe off your sweat, gentlemen; and take some refreshment— there is no need of wasting your labour, you know.— Time enough to harness yourselves to the pullies and levers again, when the pulses are stronger.” Now, my uncle never gave himself any such trouble. He whipped me, first, to keep up his spirits; next, for exercise; next, for the terrour and edification of his children, (as the Spartans made their slaves drunk)—and, lastly, as he often assured me, with tears in his eyes, for my everlasting happiness. And, therefore, he, generally, left off whipping me, only when he was out of breath—whether I were dead or alive; or I, pretty near my chance for everlasting happiness. To this compassionate nature of his; together with some experience in the trade of a butcher—such as sticking a hog, now and then, for pastime; or knocking down an ox; or flaying a young calf alive; or slitting the throat of a lamb;—I am willing to attribute such forbearance; though I have known him, once or twice, to continue the discipline, after he was out of breath; and till he was all in a lather. It was really a pity, I used to think, that he took up the profession of a butcher. I should have fared much better, I have no doubt, if he had continued to resort to it, only now and then, as an amateur, for amusement; for the pleasantest thing, we know, will become irksome to us, if it be always under our nose, as I have heard married men say—of their wives. Nay, it is a melancholy truth, I believe, that, just in proportion to our delight in anything for amusement, is our aversion to it, as a business. We can live upon chips, or Johnny-cake—saw-dust, and homminy; (at least, the Virginians can;) but we should soon die upon sweetmeats. We can trudge all day long, with a pack upon our shoulders—day after day— week after week—but we are soon worn out with dancing. We can live, comfortably enough, for whole years, with our wives, when we no longer thrill at their touch; but our hearts would whirl themselves to death, in a long honey moon. So it was with my uncle. Flaying dead animals with a knife, grew to be quite a hum-drum sort of a thing with him, at last;—and one day, for variety, he had just nailed a live fox, that had been playing the devil in the farm-yard for a long time, to a board; and was skinning him, alive.—By heaven, you might have heard the poor animal shriek for three miles. But, I had the courage—God gave it to me—to drive a knife through the creature's heart, and release him—for which piece of simplicity, my uncle seemed mightily disposed to make me take his place on the board—and play little Saint Bartholomew;—but he relented—told me, in his kindest manner, (while the blood rushed into his eye-balls, and through his swarthy temples, like a sudden explosion within him,) “to run up to the house, and put on my biggest shoes;”—for I had two pair—neither of which was I permitted to clap my feet into, except to go to church, or take a flogging in—(thereby promoting several other pleasant associations in my mind.) I obeyed—husbanding my wrath for the day of retribution;-and, that time, he emptied my large shoes twice —and then left me hanging, in the slaughter-house, till they bubbled over a third time; and my trowsers were drenched in my own blood. I was nearly dead, I remember; but I prayed God just to live a little longer— a very little—whatever might become of me, afterward —till I could mete out a small measure of my thankfulness to the father, in his own way; or, if that might not be, till I could strangle one or two of his nasty children, who were amusing themselves, while I hung there, with snapping their little whips and handkerchiefs, at me. Once he stopped—he came to me. I was black in the face—I had determined, afraid as I was of death, to hold my breath till I died. He was frightened—and I had not the power to hold it longer. I had just life enough left, to give him one look—one, which he never saw again, and never forgot, till twenty-two years after; when it broke over him, as the blood gushed out of his own ears;—and somebody—he knew not that it was the idiot boy—knelt upon his breast—and only forbore from crushing his heart out, because it was in the unpeopled place; and he felt that the great God was looking down upon him. From that hour, he was afraid of me. I saw it—I knew it. And, from the moment that he drenched me with scalding pickle, and cut me down, until he held his life at my mercy, he never ceased to persecute, thwart, and wrong me. Yet, he continued to whip me; and, when he was done, out of compassion to my bruised and torn flesh, he would scatter fine salt over it, “to prevent me from taking cold;”—and then, (for he was a very, very pious man; and used to read all day long, of a Sunday, through his nose,) he would go down upon his knees, and pray, devoutly, for the idiot, Neck or Nothing. I was called by that name, pretty generally, then. The next thing, that I remember, is the death of my little brother Benjamin; who had his head, luckily for him, poor fellow, crushed by a great tree, that was blown down, smack through the roof of our house.— Poor Benny!—he loved me, too—he did, indeed, though he was deaf-and-dumb; and, even now, when I think of him, I can hear the wind roar—the house shake in the hurricane—as it did then; and see his little bright eyes, with the lustre crushed out of them; and the brains bubbling down upon the floor. Well, here was another death—nothing but death, death, death; till, at last, I would tremble and turn pale, if anything wanted to love me—and began to expect, as a thing of course, some frightful event to happen to every body, that looked kindly upon me—even to the cattle in the farm-yard— or the poor ducklings that I fed, secretly, with dough, in a time of great scarcity; for which I was whipped, I verily believe, more than twenty times—although the dough was my own; and made out of my own allowance of bread, by soaking it in water. Benny loved me, too, poor innocent!—and, therefore, he died. Somebody that makes poetry, has just said the same thing— “I never loved a tree nor flower, But 'twas the first to fade away: I never nursed a dear gazelle, To glad me with her large black eye; But, when it came to know me well, And love me—it was sure to die.” I am not fond of poetry. I do not understand it. But somebody—no matter who—she began to love me; and when I fled from her—for, it appeared to me, that she turned pale, while she smiled upon me—she pursued me, and made me tell why I ran away from her; and when I did tell her why, in my simplicity, she repeated some poetry that I never shall forget—her voice—her breath—her lips—they made the name of poetry dear to me; dearer, I am sure, than anything else, under heaven, could have done. It should have been written upon my forehead, at my birth—it is written upon my heart—and it shall be written upon my tomb. Soon after, little Benny, my deaf-and-dumb brother, died, my father ordered me to be solemnly christened over again, with the name of my uncle, William. I bore it patiently; for I loved the only person of that name, that I had ever heard of, then; and little Benny loved him, too—and while he nestled in my lap, and lay by me; and grew to my very heart, in his helplessness, how could I help loving what he loved? For two months in the year—more or less—I was a bad boy; I cannot deny that;—but, during the other ten, I was quite an exemplary one—as to plundering gardens and orchards, I mean. This I can recollect, distinctly; and it is a matter of great consolation to me, now, that I had so much forbearance At last, all these names had to give place to that of Neck or Nothing, as I have told you; in consequence, I verily believe, of a joke, perpetrated by the parson of our parish, upon my wilfulness. That I might the better remember this, my uncle suggested the expediency of a gentle cowhiding—my common allowance, instead of pocket money, on holidays, like Christmas; Election, Thanksgiving; and fourth of July—till my back became a calendar of remarkable events, to all the world but myself. The hint was taken, from an old conveyancer, who lived in a litigious neighbourhood; and had a large family of boys, whom he let out, to be whipped at the boundaries of land:—hence, he used to say, the red dotted lines, that are common in what are called plats— where such land is in dispute—they represent the trickling of blood, from one boundary to another. So—I was whipped—and whipped—and whipped— whatever happened; whether it was I, or they; or any body that wanted to remember any event—I was the stick upon which they notched the day. But, peradventure they forgot, that I might learn to remember them also. Yet, thanks be to God! I have lived to remind them of it. It was a matter, I soon found, of great concern, with all my relations, that I should escape, as lightly as possible, hereafter. Several methods were suggested, I have been told; but, none of them were of a nature, not to be counteracted by my unhappy and inherent propensity to evil. Therefore, as I charitably hope, was I tortured, and torn, and bruised as I was, by every living creature that came near me, till I was big enough to stand at bay. Next to saving me, whether I would or not; the most certain plan was, that of counteracting the effects of damnation, by deadening, neutralizing my sensibility. To do this, it was only necessary to destroy my nerves, physical and intellectual; and to do that, was the simplest thing in the world; it was only to shame me, soul and body, till I was all over, within, and without, one callous. Thus, I was whipped; parboiled; skinned; starved; frozen and roasted, on earth. And, what more could they have done to me in hell? Man!—man!—I had a heart like a well—into it, every living creature might have dipped—for my blood, to make it happier. All that I would have prayed for, in return, was, a little love—a little gentleness—a very little.—I could not bear much—it would have killed me. Yea, such was the heat of Bill Adams, when he was born; nay, for many a year after he was born— ready to empty itself into any other heart, that came near it. But, never mind—let me relate the cause of the last flogging, that I ever received—the last blow with a whip—and the last that I ever will receive, from anything less than my Maker, without returning it, though my arteries explode upon the spot—and I am consumed to ashes, for it. One day, I had been forbidden to go near the wharves, about the south end of Boston; or, under any pretence whatever, to go near the salt water. I was a wretched swimmer, but passionately fond of swimming; and I hated to swim in fresh water—and then, our river was neither fresh nor salt—but dirty and troubled, without being buoyant; in consequence of the tide, that flowed up, for miles above our swimming place. I felt that the prohibition, of my uncle, was mere wantonness; and I determined to evade it, whenever I had an opportunity. I took my pudding-and milk, with the rest of the family, that night; and, went off, rather earlier than usual, as my aunt supposed, to my bed; but, hardly was I well into it, when I began to wish that I had run down to the river and washed, first; for, it was in vain to think of swimming there, at a season of the year, when the fresh waters, all about, were full of saw-dust, slabs, mud turtles, and floating timber; to say nothing of water snakes, which were far more terrible to me than “shirks.” The more that I thought of it, the more impatient I became; the weather was close and sultry; the day had been very hot, till just about sunset; when a “smart” shower had fallen, which had only made every living creature more insupportably languid, testy, and fretful. The musquitoes bit, like devils; and, in short, I could bear it no longer. So, I bounced out of bed—huddled on a part my clothes, and ran down to the river, dressing as I went. I looked at it, and shuddered—it was too dark and muddy—and I could see millions and millions of water snakes, as plainly as I can see this paper, crawling about on the bottom. So, I kept on, at a light, pleasant trot, with part of my clothes in my hand, by the river path, looking for a better place; when, all at once, my blood began to leap in my veins. I heard the shouting of boys!—I listened—I knew that they were swimming, by the cry.—A moment more, and I knew that they were in the salt water—for, as I came out from under the great willow trees, the noise went by me, for a moment, as the wind shifted. I could'nt stand that! It was more than a mile, yet, to the nearest place, where I might expect to find them; but, some how or other, I was there—in the midst of them—before I had well made up my mind about the distance, or the propriety of my going there. Ah, how my blood rippled and thrilled, when I first felt the water about my naked feet. I was bare footed, when I arrived. That, I could account for—I remember that. But, after a little time, I found myself, to my astonishment, perfectly naked; though, to this day, I have no recollection of undressing; or, even of looking at my clothes. I only know, that, I determined, over and over again, not to undress; and, not to run the risk of drowning; although, I confess, that, while I did this, I was paddling, in the water, with my feet; and, now and then, ducking my head, a little; or, dropping one leg, over the raft of pine boards, upon which, the boys were assembled, into the cool, delightful water. I wanted to plunge—I stood up—and sat down—I don't know how many times—went back, on the raft, twenty times, at least; shut my eyes, and determined to plunge, headlong; but, still, when I came to the point, and felt the single board yielding under my weight, and the water rising, my courage would fail—and, I would stop short—reason with myself awhile; and then, try again; but, still, I was afraid. Never did my heart so pant, and thrill, between terrour, shame, and temptation, in all my life. The deep, blue tide, rose, every moment, higher and higher; and, rippled, and sparkled, more and more temptingly, about my feet; the end of the raft, upon which we were, kept sinking, lower and lower; and, I was getting deeper and deeper, into the water; for, I stood out, upon a thin, slender board, far from the rest; and yet, I was afraid to plunge—and had'nt the power to go away from the place. The boys took no notice of me, for some time; but, by and by, as they came out, and began dressing, all about me; and going away, one after another, from the raft to the wharf—there was a little whispering, which grew louder and louder, till they mocked at me, and shamed me, for my cowardice. They even proposed to push me overboard, by main force; and others threatened to pelt me, with blue mud, that I might be obliged to go in; and, others again, proposed to take away my clothes, and keep them, until I went in, voluntarily. But, all would'nt do. I stood, like one in a trance. I was mortally afraid of all that they threatened; yet, afraid to do either the one thing, or the other. My clothes fell, piece by piece, from my hand, where I stood; and, I am fully persuaded, that I should have made no resistance, whatever they had attempted upon me, whether of insult or cruelty; although I was a very powerful boy of my age—and could not, were it to save my life, swim five times my whole length. At last, they left me; probably intimidated, by my strange silence, and regardlessness of their threats. I looked about me. I felt the silence—the awful silence of the place, weighing me down. I could see nobody—hear nobody. I thought myself altogether alone; if not in the whole world, at least in that part of the world. I felt persuaded, that I was going to be drowned; that nothing could save me—nay, that, after a few minutes, I should be obliged to go down, gradually, and slowly into the water—down to the very bottom. And, yet, strange as it may seem, I was not frightened— there was only a pleasant, drowsy, and cool thrilling, through all my blood. I looked down into the water, continually. It was clear and dark—shadowy, I mean; not turbid—but, I could see the flounders, and plaice; and eels; and sculpions; (the ugliest fish in the world, except the lamprey) swimming all about the bottom; or mooring, with a fat, lazy, undulating, continual motion, just over the bottom;—and multitudes of little starry looking fish, active and bright, as the smelt; or, the dull brown and yellow of the tommy-cod; or the purple of the young pollock; sporting, hither and thither, in all directions, like birds, through the air; E some, like flashes of white fire; and others, turning up their golden bellies, now and then, like creatures that have the power of becoming visible or invisible, at will; for no eye could trace them, except by an occasional rich effusion, of colour and faint brightness, in the water; like that of the fire-fly in the air;---or, that of the lightning-bug, in the grass. Look where I would, these brilliant creatures were incessantly in play, among the stars, which were reflected in the depth below me, as if heaven had been showering them down, like blossoms, into the habitation of the waters. Ah, I cannot describe the stillness that was about me. It was awful. It was like that of death. The sky was bluer than I had ever seen it—and much further off, it appeared to me; and the sweet, solemn stars were multiplied, in the water, till my head ached with the temptation of their influence; and I was on the point, child that I was, of plunging after them. Do not smile, whoever you may be. Many drowned women, and children, have felt the same fascination, I have no doubt; drawing them, as it were, by a song and a spell, into the bosom of the great deep; and I have felt it more than once, neither as a woman, nor as a child;— but, on this night, it was more like an attraction—an irresistible, secret allurement—a delightful influence; winning and persuading me into a voluntary self destruction. It was more like some unknown affinity operating upon my blood—upon the spiritual part of me—my thought—like a charm; than like what I have felt, as a strong hand pressing me into the water, by main force. At one time—the time that I allude to— we were upon the high seas—a few starved and desperate men—our lips cracked and bloody with our last hateful meal:—and we were drifting, with our helm lashed down, and topsail flying in the wind, far and wide—like—O, unlike anything ever seen upon the waters!—more like a floating hospital of lunaticks and murderers; than a gallant ship, well manned, and obedient to the helm—and out upon the ocean—instinct with spirit—as if it had a soul and a will of its own;— water-logged—helpless—unable to put her before the wind—and altogether alone, in the very middle of the unclouded, unfathomable, immeasurable deep. I was lying, I remember, in the hot sunshine, upon the half burnt deck, with my head over the side of the ship, gasping—giddy, and sick, and deadly faint—looking blindly down into the sea; and ready to give up the ghost, with every sick, impatient sob;—when, all at once, there was a terrifick explosion below me—a strong light flashed into my brain—my veins tingled—my blood was all in confusion—and the great deep heaved, and roared, and broke up, and vanished!—vanished, like a dream, from below me. And where it had been, there came up a dizzy wilderness of beauty, and flower, and greenness. The winds blew; and the trees rustled all over, and waved their rich branches; and the birds flew about; and the flowers fell; and every where, through the short thick grass; and out of the old rocks, which were spotted with shining moss, the greenest in the world—the waters gushed and bounced —and sparkled, and rattled—and then wandered away, singing the self same tune that the birds were all singing—in a labyrinth of brightness—with a reality so unspeakably tempting, that I had well nigh leaped down into the bosom of the apparition—among the sharks and water-snakes—before I caught my breath. I did attempt it! I attempted to stand upon my feet, they said—and threw up my arms, with a cry of transport—just as the vessel heeled—and I should have been overboard, but for the Dwarf—the Accursed, I had always called him—who plucked me back, and held me, like a giant. I smote him that he fell; but he never relinquished his hold—though his white teeth were set with pain—and the blood gushed out of his broad, swarthy temples;-never, never, until I had come fully to myself.—Well, well—that was the third and the last time, that I had felt a temptation, like a pressure, upon me. And now, let me return to the raft, and the boys. There was a kind of stupefaction upon me, I believe; the stupefaction of fear. I know not how long it lasted; but it was finally broken by a piteous cry—from afar of—followed by a loud shouting from a vessel in the stream, and from the boys at the wharf. I had no idea where the cry came from—nor where the creature was, that uttered it; whether in the air, or under the water; but my heart stopped with affright. I continued looking, however, in the direction, to which I had first turned my face, on hearing it—until I saw two or three boys running down the side of the wharf, not far from me, crying out, that a boy was drowning; and something else, that I did not understand. But I saw them looking, at the same time, to a very black place in the water—where it was either very deep, or shadowed by something; and I, too looked for a moment. A few little bubbles rose, from the centre of that black place; one after the other, to the top of the water, each one nearer and nearer to me. I ran to the extreme end of a board—I gasped for breath—I must have breathed loud, for I did'nt speak—yet, they heard me to the wharf, and shouted to me—while I was pressing both hands upon my heart; for I was afraid that it would burst—and listening to a sound, that appeared to come up out of the water. The next moment, I saw something white—rolling over and over, twenty feet below me— like the shape of a human creature, struggling, and trying to swim upward;—then, it began to rise—it floated—and then sank again. I could bear it no longer. I plunged after it, in the midst of a general shriek, from the wharves and vessels. A shark!—A shark!— they all shouted together. It was too late. I heard the cry, to be sure; but I was already in the grasp of something, that I struck against, with a force that stunned me; from which, there seemed to be no escape; before I had time to think of what I was about. All that followed, was but the struggle of a moment. I had been distinguished, by great bodily strength, from the time of my early childhood. More than once, has it saved my life; but never, in a manner more wonderful, or so instantaneously, as on this occasion. Something, as I have mentioned, grappled at my body; but, it was half a minute, before I felt myself fairly in its power; and then, my right arm was useless. With my left, however, I instantly disengaged myself; and, forgetful of all danger, for I felt a head of human hair floating about my face; I caught at it, with my left hand; and instantly rose to the top of the water. God be praised for it!—the raft was covered with people—and we were both saved;—myself, with a broken arm, which I had, probably, struck against the sunken timber, at the bottom of the raft—the ends of which ran out, irregularly, from the main body;—and the poor drowned boy, all wrapped about with eel grass—which, but for me, would have kept him at the bottom, till life were entirely extinct. While I was in my revery, at one end of the raft, he, poor fellow, with more courage than I, although he could'nt swim, had let himself down into the water, it appeared, holding on by his hands; instead of jumping boldly into it; and had been instantly sucked under it; and would, infallibly, have been drowned, but for the boys, who saw him, as he came up, and gave one cry, after having struck his head against the bottom of the raft; and before he went down to the very bottom, and became entangled in the eel grass, with which he was contending, probably, when I first saw the bubbles of air, which I mentioned; and the white appearance in the water, which carried me overboard. Had I been a brave boy, I could have withstood that; and had I been like other boys, I should have gone into the water, at first, from downright shame. Well, I saved the life of a human creature. And what was my reward? I was whipped nearly to death for it; but I swore then, by the blood of my own heart, that it should be for the last time. It was for the last time. That boy has now become a man—a great man—a good one;—while my uncle—rest his soul—and my father, are—no matter where. I have seen one of them upon his death-bed, and helped to quicken them, both, I am afraid, upon their journey.</field>

Death of cousin...Incidents...Bigotry...Reflections. One word more of my family. My sister Charity, afterward called Catherine-Elizabeth; and then, Elizabeth, grew up into one of the gentlest and most beautiful of God's creatures. You could'nt bear to call her Catherine; particularly, if you were acquainted with the true character of the northern amazon; after whom, if not for whom, my mother had named her; or her brutal sensuality; and coarse, masculine, and domineering spirit;—nor Kate, lest you should think of Shakspeare's shrew—and she, heaven knows, was far enough from that character;—nor Elizabeth, if you remembered king Elizabeth, of England—the man in petticoats; whose heart was a great magazine of shattered finery, paints, patches, and regal gewgaws—a crowned and throned monarch, furbelowed all over with Flanders lace—a king-milliner—alike in mind and person—supremely little and great, at the same time—burnishing shields and spangles—building head dresses and seventy-fours—in love with dominion, whether of empires or hearts; vain, alike, of the power which she had, and of the beauty, which she had not;—a king, on all befitting occasions—a mere woman on all others—no, you could not profane my sister with the name of such a woman; —and Eliza—that would not do—it was too childish. I never knew a fool, that was'nt called Eliza, of course; a she-fool, I mean;—although, I do not pretend to say, that all Eliza's are fools. No—I know better. I have met, and loved, more than one woman of that name; and I could'nt love, or meet a second time, an ordinary woman. This affair troubled me not a little, till I found her full grown, to far less than a womanly stature, however; with clear grey eyes; very long, and very dark eye-lashes; a countenance shy and timid, in general; but rouse her; put her nature sufficiently to the proof; and you would swear that she had a devil within her; but then—it was a beautiful bright-eyed devil. Her hair was very remarkable. There was a brilliancy in it, almost metallick—like spun gold; and yet, it was very soft. But rouse her---alarm her; and you would look at her in amazement. Her whole form would undergo an instantaneous illumination;---her hair would shake, and quiver, and sparkle, with electricity;---her eyes would dilate;---and her red mouth would open with such intense, vivid, and scornful vitality, that—ah! she was really blinding in her beauty, at such a moment. Allow all that you will, for the partiality of a brother; and for my proneness to exaggeration; still, there was a nature in her, as you will find, by and by, unlike that of other women. Compared to them, she was all soul. Many, and many a time, have I seen the little delicate creature dilate to the stature of a princess, and shiver all over; and her eyes lighten, like those of a young wild cat, when she has been set upon, without notice, by the dogs.[2] [2] I once met with a woman that reminded me of her—and but once.—It was Miss Owenson, now lady Morgan: I was a good deal agitated—she was not half so beautiful as Elizabeth—nor so well made (one shoulder being a little higher than the other)—but her fairy littleness, and exceeding vivacity reminded me so, of her, that my eyes filled immediately. She was very diminutive---very; but perfectly formed; with a constitution so frail, that the snapped lily were its only emblem, if the rude wind blew over it. Yet with that habitation, I have seen her proud spirit awe men, when it looked out of her eyes;---men, who had stood untroubled before the majesty and wrath of many a larger woman—till their very step was unsteady—and their high foreheads wrought with alarm. Yea—I have known her move the lame dwarf himself, till, devil as he was—to my thought—the tears gushed out of his great ugly eyes—like water from a trodden spunge. That sister—I cannot trust myself to speak of her: —there was a something so etherial; so pure and spiritual about all that she thought, or said—a flavour in it—a perfume about it, at least to the heart of her brother—that—no, it won't do—it won't. I have been so little used to kindness in this world; and least of all, among women that were beautiful—that—but—no— no matter.— My poor mother loved me, because I was her child; little Fidele—because there was nobody else, in all the world, to feed or caress him;—my helpless, deaf-and-dumb brother, because he was safe with me, from all that worried or mocked at him—and because—no matter why—my arteries had run for him, more than once, till my big cow-hide shoes frothed over. But my sister—she loved me—for myself alone: it was not that I was kind to her, or afraid of her—for that, I could not help--and all the world were kind to her—and afraid of her—and she knew not what unkindness was. The very brute beasts, that came near to her, it did appear to me, were gentler in their movement. It was not that I was ready to die for her; because, I was ready to die for anybody that would let me—provided that there was an express command, of my father, or uncle, to the contrary. No—but she loved me, for my heart, when nobody else knew that I had one;—for my understanding, when all the world thought me a fool; nay, when I had began to believe it, myself;—for my disposition, when it was all evil, in the sight of others. Let me speak of her. It is to her; and to her alone, that I owe everything, that is good, or great, in my nature;—my love to man; my reverence for God;—my reputation---my self confidence. But for her, I should have been what other people thought me---an idiot—possessed with an evil spirit.—All, that hath yet supported me!—all, that supports me now!—all, that will support me, hereafter!—and give me the courage to face our compassionate Father in Heaven (I do not speak of my father now—I don't care much about meeting him—or my uncle)--all, all! do I owe to the sweet upbraiding, and the proud impulses of that child:—for she was a child—even with the stature of a woman—a child in her simplicity; a child in her innocence; a child in her affectionate nature—but her spirit was not of the earth. It was eagle-eyed, and eagle pinioned too; and, when she used to fall upon my bosom, and sob there;—and murmur, like some sweet, strange instrument, answering to the low wind;—even then, while she emptied her young heart into mine—I was afraid to look her in the face—afraid and ashamed:— yet I was the older; and, with a finger, could have crushed her—but her dominion was enchantment—intellect, love—power and strength—fetters of steel, interwoven with violets;—a sceptre of iron—by some delicious sorcery made to flower all over, like a branch of apple blossoms—a flame to crumble and melt—hidden with odour and vapour—curse this nonsense—my sister, pardon me. It were better to say, at once, the plain truth; that I loved thee, as never man loved woman;— and that I was beloved by thee;—and leave all this trash of the imagination, to drift where it will, on the wind or the water. But there were more of the family. Sampson Achilles, the last child of my mother, born after she had begun to read profane history, was crushed by the weight of his names. They were put upon him, exactly at a year old; and he never grew an inch afterward— in longitude, I mean. For a yearling, he was a wonder; a great lubberly fellow, with a head like a half bushel:—but for a man, he was a little monster. His name, too, has dwindled away into sounds that are really somewhat amusing to my recollection—Sampson they have abreviated, in their familiar way, to Sammy; and Achilles, to Kelly—so that, luckily for him, the original endowment is forgotten—and Sampson Achilles, himself, is now only, Sammy Kelly. He was the darling of my parents; but a base, cowardly, thieving and malicious creature, as ever God put the breath of life into:—an evil spirit. if ever there was one upon this earth; so malignant in its nature, that the only alternations of pastime with him, from the day that he was able to impale flies, till this hour, have been between worrying cats; drowning dogs; fighting cocks— and making life hateful to everybody; and, more particularly, to his brothers and sisters. Twice, have my hands been about his throat—and twice, would I have strangled the imp, but for the interference of Elizabeth —once for scorching her beautiful hair, and blinding her with gunpowder;—and another time, for putting snakes into her bed. His little eyes were spiteful, red and fiery; and eternally snapping, till the lashes were either worn off, or singed off. His mouth was very large and awry; and his laugh,—my blood curdles, at the thought of it, now. He was weak too;—and his great, unmanageable head kept rolling about, with his fat tongue lolling out of it, as he sat; for he never ran, or walked or leaped—moping in the sunshine or rain—(for both were alike to him)—or lay, half buried in the ashes So hateful was the creature to me, in time, that I could not think of him without a spasm;—and, for years and years afterward, I could not bring myself to believe that a human creature could resemble him, even in the colour of his eyes;—or have a big head; or unnaturally quick fingers;—and not resemble him in heart; nay, I fell into the vulgar notion, as a matter of belief, that, if a man be a dwarf, he must be a devil; if hump-backed; that he must have kicked his way into the world, as my brother did his—and have torn his own mother, like a beast, with his first breath. Let the sequel tell how true were my prejudices; and how wise. It was a religion once, with me, that deformity of person was an infallible proof, of a deformed and devilish spirit. And that a monster in body—was, therefore, a monster in heart. Others have thought so, too---a legion of plays and novels have been got up, to prove the same thing. I have known one exception. Jeremiah was---but I have already told you what he was; and is---a blockhead---six feet high---and fashioned like a god. Are you a woman?---What more would you know? For myself, I am---the Lord knows—far enough from being either handsome---six feet high---or a blockhead; ---probably, from a naturally perverse temper;---for I could not bear to be drawn out as nail rods are, by beating;---nor to be made a fool of, where it was so easy to be a knave. Am I handsome?---heaven forbid. I have seen some ugly men in my time, but never more than two, so diabolically ugly as myself:---one was my precious brother, Sammy Kelly, and the other, a man ---of whom, more by and by. I speak of my countenance only---for my person and limbs are very good;---but there was a time, when all the world looked at me, through a glass darkly---I was one of the men---who walk like trees. Let me run back for a moment. The first decided operation of all the severity, that I have mentioned, was to make me hate my father with all my heart, and all my soul;---and my dear uncle, ten thousand times more bitterly. Both had been distilling a cup of death for themselves, for many a long and weary day:---my tears and blood had run, year after year, into their alembick, ---but the vapour was condensed, at last; and fell, in drops of fire, upon their own hearts—God! it would have eaten through steel. But my sister stood by, when I would have re-sprinkled my father with it---and she withheld my hand, and extinguished the red poison with her tears. There was none to shelter my uncle. I saw it fall---drop by drop---sink---and heard the blood hiss---and---yes I did!---and though I have shed mine own since, in sorrow for it---yet I scorn to deny it. Yes!---and I sat by him, and mocked at him, in his convulsions. The next effect was---to confound all distinctions of right and wrong in my mind. If I went to school, I was whipped;---if I played truant. I was whipped. This made a liar of me. I dared not tell the truth---if I did, I was whipped;---and if I did not, I was whipped. It matters little what I did, or did not---the whipping was a part of my daily allowance;---rations, that were dealt out to me, sick or well, dead or alive. I have been beaten for going to church; and beaten for staying at home. I have been beaten for whipping a boy, twice my size, who struck me; and beaten, for being whipped by a man. I have been beaten for whisthing of a Sunday; and beaten for holding my tongue. In short, whether I robbed orchards; kicked a Bible about in the mud; set fire to the minister's wig; saved a poor boy's life; or attempted to strangle my own brother, I was always beaten, so long as they could stand over me. This, in time, became of use to me. It made me regard torture and death as a trifle---the pain of death, I mean;---the fortitude of an Indian, as hardly worth a thought, for, though I have been scourged, again and again, till I foamed at the mouth; no human being ever saw me wince, at such a time---or a tear fall from me--- or ever heard one moan from my lips. And yet, I could cry---I could---and laugh too, till the skies would ring again,---at what other people saw not; or seeing, heeded not. Nay, so sudden and fearful were these transitions in my nature; that, when I was fourteen, I frightened all of our family and kindred, by one of them. A dear, dear cousin of mine died. I loved her very tenderly. I would have laid down my life for her. I was standing by the coffin. The room was full of people---I had turned back the lid reverently, boy that I was---for what is death, that it should awe me!---said I, to myself---while my hand shook---and my head grew giddy.---I had just raised the thin muslin from her dead, beautiful face---and the tears were blinding and choking me. I put my hand upon her shut eyes---her sunken temples---forgetful of all propriety;---and though they were so frightfully cold, that my blood stopped running, all at once---as if my heart had been adrift till then---in the cold ocean---and just struck and shivered against something;---and I shook all over, with a strange in ward concussion---yet I would willingly have lain there, forever---frozen to her, cheek to cheek--- mouth to mouth---and been buried with her:—but somebody---I knew not who---I never turned to look, plucked at me, rudely---and would have torn me from her, as he would, a wild beast from his prey. I bore it patiently, awhile---but not long. I just lifted my hand---nobody saw the motion---but the man that felt it, staggered through the door, as if he had been struck by the paw of a wild beast.—He fell; and, as he fell, he carried with him, men, women and children. The room was emptied---as if the dead body, itself, had given the blow; and I was left alone with it. This was all that I wanted.---I grew blind and giddy with excessive emotion---I cleft a lock of her beautiful hair, ---it was like wet silk---from her transparent temples: it had been denied to me before---and then, I laughed ---dashed out the lights---laughed, till my heart ached--- and my temples were sore; and when I bounded through the window; and left them to recover from their consternation---as they might. I was never forgiven. Such was the effect of their unnatural severity. They scourged me, as if I had been a mis-begotten creature of darkness;---and they continued to scourge me, till there was nothing of humanity left in my nature---till I cared no more for what they called death, as they said--- and thought no more of pain, than if I had been made of cast iron. The laws that were made for me, were literally written in blood.---in mine own blood---I might have had as hearty a reverence for them, it may be, if they had been chiseled upon brass or stone. They were truly the laws of Draco---written in blood---and meting the same punishment for every offence. Hence, I came to learn, why unnatural restraint leads to unnatural excess; why, the greatest criminals have charged their parents, with a too unsparing severity in their childhood; why that proverb is true, which declares that “deacons daughters, and parsons sons,” are more profligate and wicked, than others. The punishment being always the same, I naturally concluded that the offence was. To me, therefore, there was no difference between lying and murdering; whistling on a Sunday, and blaspheming all religion; sleeping at church; resenting an insult; or knocking down a priest, at the communion table. But, I went abroad. I found that men of talent, and worth, and influence---great men, and good men, too--- even in the eyes of my own father, would sometimes tell a lie; whistle of a Sunday; sleep at church; or horse-whip a fellow, that spit in their faces. This staggered me, at first. There must be something, I thought, radically wrong in the doctrines, which had been inculeated F into my flesh, so carefully, so circumstantially, and so continually. My conscience tingled a little; and I was a good deal shocked; at my first transgression; but, in time, I became reconciled to the whole matter; and, having found that my father and uncle were egregious fools or knaves, in many things; I took it for granted, that they were, in all. So that, at the end of a year, after I went abroad in the world, I was just as ready to murder, as to lie; and just as ready to lie, as to snore in church; and just as ready to snore in church, as in my own bed-chamber. And, so hath it been, from all time, with all bigotry. Reason must have way. Her fire will be kindled, by some gentle hand; or by the wind; or by the lightning; but wo to them that wait for the latter! Once lanched, there is no quenching it; blood will not do it; tears; no, nor the ashes of temple nor crucifix; nor the dust of the overthrown altar It will have way; rending, and exploding, and tearing into the very bowels of the earth, where the people of countless generations, are holding their dead, silent, and terrible congress. Just so is it, with the abused child; and the trodden slave; nay, just so with the Catholick murderer, whose bloody fingers shake, as he counts out the gold for his redemption---not with blood---but with terrour of the priesthood. Touch once his red heart---let it begin to flow---let him but once open his eyes upon the foot of the bald spectre, that is set upon it; and, exhausted as he is---humbled as he is---he will upheave the tyrant from his dominion, and grind him to the dust. Give to a man, a plain substantial nutriment; and he never becomes either a slave or a despot; but feed him upon terrour, humiliation, and ruin; superstition and hatred; replenish his veins with such fiery aliment---and you are nourishing an earthquake---a volcano. One spark, and it will explode---then where are you? The very chains that bound a people to you, are melted with the shock---and fall upon you, in a rain of fire. Look at France---Italy---Spain---Portugal---where Superstition once held her tremendous dominion unquestioned, unapproachable. But, a convulsion happened;---the veil was rent!---the curtain plucked away, and set fire to!---her sceptre broken!---and a people of slaves---priest ridden and trampled slaves---arose like the dead natives of all the earth, at the sound of the last trumpet---laid waste the dominions of men---nor stopped till they were driven back from the battlements of heaven---by a tempest of smoke and fire. They awoke from a long trance, like men that have been drugged with death---amid relicks and miracles; and, finding that they had been deceived, by a priesthood; they have broken them down---and scattered them to the four winds of heaven; and overturned altar and temple, in their wrath. Were it not better, that the dominion of darkness had been shorter, or less terrible? So is it with nations; so, with men; so, with me. I knew not where to stop; nor what was true.</field>

Education...Advice...Friendship. There are some difficult things, that appear simple enough, when they are once explained; and we are often provoked at our own blindness, after we have been told how some enchantment hath been wrought; when we might never have imagined the truth, if we had been left to ourselves. There is a curious propensity in the mind, to overlook the common, while it gazes after the improbable events of life. We love the marvellous; and, while we ridicule our neighbours, for the same folly, we are loving it, more heartily than they. We hear of some murder; or, of some old haunted chambers, for example; and, while we laugh at the story of both, our blood thrills at the recital; and nothing will satisfy us, till we get to the bottom of the mystery. In the mean time, whatever happen, we are always sure to imagine a more complicated series of reasoning and design, than is ever the true one. We attribute motives to people, who never had any motive for their conduct; and judge of all, not by placing ourselves in their situation, at the time when a given deed was done, were it evil or good; but by the circumstances that have since happened.— This mode of judgment is cruel and preposterous. I do differently. I think differently. I do not judge of anything, by the result, when I can help it. I would rather fight a good battle, and be conquered; than a bad one, and conquer. So too, if I am watching the movements of a juggler, political or religious; the harmless operator upon our pocket: or, the more dangerous one, upon our credulity; whose legerdemain is for government here, and hereafter; I am prone to imagine his contrivance far more simple and short sighted, than people in general do.— They overlook whatever is probable; and rush into the marvellous. And why? I did the same thing when I was a boy. But I have grown wiser now. I took it for granted, once, if I had been cheated, that it must have been by the most consummate address. Nothing else would console me under the imposition;—nothing else could reconcile me to myself. It is painful, is'nt it?—to be deluded very stupidly? Yet, so it is. Ask any juggler. He will tell you, that his security lies—not in the depth of his own contrivance—but in that of the theories, that are imagined to explain it. How many persons have stood by Rannie—(Do you remember him?—a fat, red faced, greasy fellow—whose light-fingered tricks were played off, in publick)—and seen him cut a piece out of a woman's gown—blow upon it—and restore it. They saw the process—the scissors—and beheld the piece. But how was it possible? A thousand pleasant inventions were thought of, to explain it. The vulgar supposed that some charm was used—some powder—which deceived one, like a fog; a little higher, you will find a people that knew how the whole was done—the piece was actually cut out, say they; but some natural cement, known only to the operator himself, was applied; and the cloth grew together. A third class would get over the affair, at once, by calling it the black art; a fourth, by reference to natural magick—the Egyptians; alchymy; and the magicians of scripture; a fifth is sure that there is some trick in the scissors—that they were not real—or that the garment was not—or, in short, anything but the simple truth. But I was not to be so easily satisfied. I looked to find it a conspiracy. I was mistaken. He came to make the experiment on Elizabeth, my own sister; she wore a white muslin, I remember; he gave me the scissors into my own hand; I cut the dress myself, while he held it. I saw it; and saw it, again, united. Yet, I did not believe in it. It disturbed me. I thought of it, continually. I went again. I kept my eyes upon him. He chose a black dress. He cut the piece out. I saw it in his hand.— F 2 “Do me the favour,” said I, “to let the dress alone with your other hand; let it fall; let me see the hole.” He was disconcerted. I saw the trick, instantly. I arrived at it, on the spot. So it has been through all my life, with me. I have found nothing inexplicable; nothing—except the heart of a woman. Rannie depended not so much upon our short-sightedness, as upon our long-sightedness, and our over-sightedness. He knew that our vanity would prevent us, for ever, from imagining that we were fooled so egregiously, as we were. A deeper trick had been discovered. But, by cutting another piece of cloth, held in the same hand, in which he had gathered up the dress, he was perfectly safe. Yet, who would ever have thought of so simple an explanation? Would you discover the truth? Do not believe a thing, merely because you cannot account for it. Do not believe it, because it is impossible. That were as wise, as to disbelieve whatever we cannot understand, in the phenomena of heaven, and earth, and air. And yet, the reverse is our natural propensity. We love the marvellous, and the alarming. Nay, we often believe a story, from its very improbability. Thus, we are told, that some sweet, timid, affectionate creature, whom we have known for many a year, hath murdered her own babe. Terrible as the tale is, we believe it; because it is impossible that any body would think of inventing such a story, of such a woman. There must be some truth in it, we are sure. Improbable as the tale of horrour is—yet, it is more improbable, that it should be a mere invention. On the contrary, we are apt to be suspicious of a very plausible, well connected, probable tale. How strangely perverse are the operations of our nature!—how full of contradiction! Would you discover the truth?—persevere. Truth is God; and God never will hide himself from the devout searcher. Yet, there are facilities upon the way—and—there! won't that do pretty well, for the beginning of a chapter? Is'nt it an essay, altogether worthy of our established novel-writers?—and reviewers? Among these matters, which are so simple when explained; and so inexplicable, till then, is the mystery of writing. Some men find it a weighty affair, to put half a dozen sentences together; yet, they can spout for an hour together, in publick; and reason, sensibly enough at home, with their tongues. Why is this? They dare not write, as they talk. They will not go abroad, but in a holy-day dress. I shall do no such thing. I am above it; and, henceforth, I shall ramble, just as capriciously as I please, in the tale that I am relating. Method is out of the question. I never pretended to it; and my utmost ambition, now, is to write my own history, just as I would tell it, to people that I loved, about a roaring fire, in the depth of winter. Reader!—what say you? Are you so wedded to the sleepy modulation of Addison, and such people, that a short sentence, or a sudden stop, will jar you like another step, at the bottom of the stairs—or no step at all, where you are ready for one? If you are, stop!—stop where you are! You are not the reader for me. I hate the simpering, smooth, sweet, musical cadence of Addison, just as I do the great, lumbering, heavy, windy, pompous, lubberly movement of Johnson. I would as soon live on sugar-candy—and sleep, for ever, upon new-mown hay, with a water-spout singing in my ears all day long, and all night, too;—or, try to keep up with the temple of Juggernaut, upon stilts—as listen to either, for more than half an hour at a time. So, if you expect to be lulled asleep, stop where you are. It will be the better for you. And if you look for a single sentence, put daintily together, like Addison's—or a single period, like Johnson's, jointed and cramped with iron—big words that have been brought together by main force, as if by a press-gang; and chained fist to fist, lest they should squabble, or mutiny—you will be disappointed. But, if you would hear a fellow creature talk, as men do talk, in our language, every day, in the street—stand by me awhile. There will be truth and nature to detain you; and one thing, at least, you may be sure of—natural language. Easy writing has been defined to be—what anybody can easily write. The definition is witty. But natural writing, I would define to be what anybody, in the same situation, would naturally say—if he could:—such as you do not often find in a book—never, in the classicks; but always, in the mouths of men and women—broken and incoherent, at times— for such is the language of passion; simple, it may be, and touching, when you least expect it; for such is the manner of them that mourn, when they are weeping at home, and alone:—stormy and impetuous; burning and acrimonious; when the crushed viper, or the outraged giant, are let out of the human heart—for such may be the bearing of common men, when mightily wronged. Their tongues are of fire—serpent like—and vivid, with the intensity of their suddenly lighted spirits. Will this content you? If it will, push on. It would be no easy affair, at this time of life, for me to recal even the names of those who, in their compassionate regard for my future welfare, assisted in destroying my evil propensities, in childhood, by kicking, and cuffing, and flagellation; but there remain two or three, somewhat more conspicuous than the rest, to whom I am greatly indebted; and I cannot resist the temptation, that I feel at this moment, to acknowledge my thankfulness to them. It was so kind in them!—so considerate!—so affectionate! Among the first, the very first, was a precious jack-ass, named Stephen Patten, a school-master, to whom it was my misfortune to be sent, for two or three excellent reasons; the chief of which, I take to be, that he was a conceited, obstinate, sleepy dolt of a fellow, with no brains at all---and rather less heart than brains. Another was, to keep me out of mischief, at the least possible expense; for it was a sort of town school that he kept, or a charity school; and called so---not so much, because it was an asylum for indigent children, as for indigent men, utterly helpless, useless, and incapable of any other employment:---and the third---I hope that I am not very uncharitable---was to have me murdered legally; or, at least, made as cheaply and certainly as possible, what the benevolent predicted that I should be, a candidate for the gallows. This man used to whip me, whenever he was out of humour. But once, in particular---I shall never forget it; and he has been nearer than he dreams, of being made to remember it since, quite as distinctly. It was a custom in the school, to make the poorer scholars sweep and clean it; and, during the winter, to bring in fuel, and kindle fires. I happened to be of that class; and, in the impartiality of this miserable wretch, a double duty fell upon me---a duty of mortification and labour. I am naturally meek; but I have a strong sense of justice; and Moses, himself, would have lost his character, had he been loaded and shamed, as I was, under Master Stephen Patten. The spiteful creature watched me continually; and every symptom of rebellion was tempered down, or trodden out, the moment that it was detected; not unfrequently, too, with what he called a lecture---a few words of which, on any occasion, would be a treat to a rhetorician. At such times, when the school was all hushed as death, he had a favourite saying, that we were pretty sure to hear, no matter what was the subject, or who the culprit;---it was about envy. “Envy,” said master Patten, “is a green-eyed monster, that flies over cities and towns;”---and this was a picture of envy, for the understanding of children, from seven to fourteen years of age! But, to the whipping.—I will try to recollect it.— Something had happened, to prevent me from making a fire at my last turn; (as it was called) which turn, by the way, put me back, amazingly, in my arithmetick; for, I could never, rightly, apprehend how, in a school of one hundred and twenty boys, where there was only one fire to be kindled in the morning; and only one morning in the day, it came to me, in rotation, to kindle it, about once in two weeks. But, so it was. And, when I failed, on this occasion, I was compassionately let off, by producing a billet, (which, I dare say, had been used by me, more than once, before; for, when it was not dated, I always managed to get it back again, in some way or other, by hook or by crook—either, by clambering in at the window; or by picking the lock of his desk) from some person in authority, showing, that I had been truly unable. But, the next week, my turn came again. “Now look you, Bill,” said the master. “Tomorrow morning, you are to make a fire in that are stove; and if you don't do it, mind—I'll skin you, alive. No excuse now; I don't care what happens.” That was a threat of little moment to me. I had been accustomed to it, at home and abroad, from friends and strangers, from my very cradle; nay, it had become no uncommon mode of salutation, for the neighbours, when I was clambering up their spouts, or robbing their gooseberry bushes—“and such small cattle.” Still, though I cared little for the threat, I cannot deny that I had always an ugly antipathy, to the process of skinning alive, from the time that I saw it practised upon the poor fox, by my uncle; and, if the truth must be told, I have not become entirely reconciled to it yet—though, many a kind creature has been half persuaded to reconcile me to it, if he could. So, I determined, as much as in me lay, to build the fire, in due season, dead or alive. But, unluckily. I had a good natured uncle, on my father's side, who had something to do with a ship;---and, was in the habit, now and then, of giving me a few cents; or a cuff; or a hiding; as he happened to be in a good or bad humour, with his coffee---or, as I happened to deserve either. He saw me, in the evening; and told me to come down on board the vessel, early in the morning; and I should have some pieces of junk, rattling, oakum, bits of spun-yarn; and, perhaps, a spare rope's end. I did'nt much like the latter item; but, looking him in the face, I found that I had nothing to fear. So, I went--- stipulating, first, for a billet to Master Patten; by way of a protection. The business done; the oakum and junk disposed of; all that had been given to me, and some that I had stolen; and the money fairly in my pocket, off I trudged, to the school, with the billet in my fist.—But, Master Patten was not to be trifled with. He first flogged me, and then read the billet;---nay, he had the impudence to declare, after it was all over, that, whatever had been the excuse, it would have made no difference. For this, I never forgave him. I did'nt care that, (snapping my fingers,) for the flogging. Nay, he might have read the billet first; and then, flogged me, till he was weary; and I should only have laughed at him. But, that the scoundrel should dare to strike me, when he knew not but I might have been locked up, by my father; and prevented, by accident, or sickness; or, by some violence, from performing my duty; nay, how knew he, but that some of the family were dead. Yet....he flogged me....and, at the first blow, that he struck me, there arose in my sweltering heart, something, I know not what; it felt to me, like a serpent, whose habitation had been made too hot for him. I looked into the eyes of the cowardly rascal; and I saw them, as plainly as I ever saw anything, blood-shot....and stained. It was a vision; and had well nigh been fulfilled; for, it is only two years ago, that I passed him, as he stood in the door of his paltry little book-shop, in conversation with three or four elderly gentlemen.— I went by, at the distance of two or three paces. I hadn't seen him, for years—I felt my blood beginning to boil—the muscles of my arm to shiver—and I knew that, if I once laid my hand upon his collar—there would be no mortal help for him. I knew this. I felt it. What saved him, God, only, knows. It might be his age—not his character. I could not strike a man, so much older than myself; though he had whipped me, when I was a helpless child, till I was raw all over. I swallowed the bitterness, that was rising in my throat, and passed by; nor, did I know how fearful had been the battle within me; till, as I turned the next corner, I felt the hot sweat pour from my forehead, like rain—till I staggered, with exhaustion; and was fain to throw myself upon my bed, the moment that I entered my room; and, the next day, when I got up, I was stiff, and sore, all over—even, to the roots of my hair; as if I had taken a violent cold. Beware—ye that give a loose to your passion, when the feeble are intrusted to you. There is no knowing what a bruised spirit may achieve; if it be not withheld, as mine was, by a strange feeling of pity, scorn, and compassion. Verily, but for that, had I not relented; and, it was wonderful that I did relent—before a hand could have been raised in his defence, I had trampled the breath out of that man's body. There was another man too, named Cobb; a quaker; whose admonitions were continual; and, as he thought, very terrible; but, luckily for him, he never had the courage to lay his hand upon me, except in meeting; when, if I made too much noise in whittling the benches, (for I used to go to—not worship in—a Friends' meeting house; where, to be orthodox, you must have pine benches, instead of pens, or pews, to sleep in,) he would sometimes get up, with the steadiest countenance in the world;—walk down the broad aisle, to the seat where a dozen of us would sit, shivering at his approach; and, single me out, for exhibition, upon the high seat. I was not very ambitious; but, this event was sure to happen, whenever there was any publick speaker;— (travelling preachers—who, having some conscience, charge nothing for their instruction; and treat their friends like tavern-keepers—eat of the best that the land affords; they and their companions, and horses— for they never go to a tavern; and live, as the wild beasts will not; on each other) among us—and more than once, have I been carefully led up, before a house full of the orthodox and heterodox, to the very highest seat, in the whole meeting house, (it were impious to call such a contrivance, a church,) and there left, with my hands and legs across, as a beacon to my companions. And once, I remember—and I wonder that I didn't get a flogging, then. There was a mischievous fellow, in the seat behind me; I had an awkwardly contrived thing upon me, called a new coat; the first, I believe, that I had ever been fitted to—I do not say, the first that had ever been fitted to me—for, that was not. It was a common joke, with the boys, on such an occasion, to cut off a button. Such is the effect upon the idle, and unocupied, in the house of God; there, as in every other place, they will be in mischief, rather than remain idle. The sublime, still worship of the spirit, is unknown, unheeded by, and unfitted to them. A good man, in the awful silence of a great solitude, will feel a more tremendous sense of nearness to the Deity, than he ever may, in temples, ringing with musick, and blinding him with magnificence. But, even he, the great and good man; he, who, when he dies, but steps once, to become an archangel—even he cannot worship God, as he would, if there be many about him. How, then, shall the wicked, and the foolish? How are children to feel the awful stillness, of Jehovah's audience chamber, ere they have learnt what stillness, or worship means?—They cannot. Therefore, it is, that the children, in a Quaker meeting house, are fuller of sneaking mischief; than at school, when their master is out, and they have nothing to do. So it was, here. Our seats were bored, through and through; whittled and gashed; scribbled on, and carved into, while God himself, if the scriptures be true, was standing in the very midst of us. On this occasion, I felt the boy; he was much larger than I; and, I was naturally timid, cowardly, and cruel. I felt him at work—and heard a suppressed breathing. There was a dead silence. I turned, and “let him have it,” as we say, into his face and eyes. The blow was quicker than lightning—his head struck the back of the seat—and, the blood spun out of his nose, into the broad aisle. He had a knife in his hand; and, till the elder, upon the “fore seat” shook hands; and, thereby, broke up the meeting, I felt, every moment, as if it were just ready to be stuck into my ribs. But, he dared not. I had been afraid of him before. Now, he was afraid of me. My promptitude had disconcerted him. While you live, reader, always give the first blow; never take it. If you have any doubt, strike. The battle is half over; and he, half whipped, who takes the first blow. up about me, till the welts and blood-blisters ran, like tight drawn purple snakes, from side to side of my body. I bawled out murder! murder!—not because of the pain; but because I did'nt like the manner; it was new to me. I then put on my jacket, and went home, side by side, with the good man; and, the last thing that I remember is, that, when I was getting over the fence, and he was talking to me, about what he intended to do, toward making a man of me—saying that he should send me to Salem, to school, and give me a new suit of clothes, and— “Snuff-colour?” said I—interruptig him—“snuff-colour, uncle?” and there the matter ended. I'll warrant you that I forgot the flogging, sooner than he did;—and I am sure that I remembered the snuff-coloured suit, the schooling much longer—for I heard no more of and either from him. I mention it, to warn other men from such doings. It was a base, vulgar expedient—barbarous and foolish. I had a proud heart, a keen sensibility. Had this man touched either—as I could that of a child, —I would sooner have been burnt to ashes, than ever touch aught of another's property afterward. But this brutal appeal, to my body, rather than to my soul,--- forced up all my bodily faculties to resist it. He might have shamed me, till the tears dropped hot from my eye lids;—till he might have filled my bed with untold money,and, I would'nt have touched it even in my dreaming. —But no—He struck at my body. And my body was that of the young Spartan. Like him, I learnt that, to steal was adventures and brave—to be found out, disgraceful.—Some author asks where is the difference between the education of a Spartan and another? Both steal; and both are punished, if they are found out.— What! is there no difference between inculcating theft, as a part of military stratagem, and punishing a boy for mal-adroitness; and denouncing theft,as the most base and cowardly of crimes—a propensity to it, as a nature to be scourged out of one, with whip and fire? But—men will reason in this way; and where they do not, they will act as if they did. In this very case, the lesson that was taught me, in pain and blood—was not, that a proud, generous and noble spirit, would disdain to pilfer;—but that, whoever did pilfer, must have a tough hide, and a stout back. I had both;—and, had I been lashed, with steel wire, red from the forge, the effect would have been precisely the same. I scorned to be beaten into a reformation. Blows and indignity only made me dastardly and revengeful. By God—I had that nature—which, if it had been rightly ministered to, would have made me a hero, at twelve years of age. And where was the mighty evil of my transgression? I lied—why? because everybody about me lied, and they that whipped me, could not tell the truth, and did not. I stole—why? Because I was perpetually exposed to temptation,—naked and unfortified, by any appeal to the pride of my nature;—kept without the allowance of any pocket money;—yet, with gold and silver perpetually at hand; and no way of obtaining any part of it, except by stealing. The boy that would not steal in such a case, must be a fool. Had I been once made to feel ashamed of it;—once made to run over at the eyes—I should have forborn all my life after, whatever had been the temptation. But they, even they, that tempted me, were more wicked than I. He that puts silver and gold in the way of the miserable and destitute; unfortified by religion; uninstructed in self denial; taught only to think of shame and suffering, not as the consequence of guilt, but as the consequence of discovery—he is a greater criminal than the wretched thief himself. Beside that—did I not find all the people about me, getting possession of property—God knows how—if it were not by cheating or pilfering. It is told of an absent man, not remarkable for his discernment (or dizzernment?—which is it?) that he had some doubt about the honesty of a servant; and that, willing to put it to the proof, he left some loose gold in his way; and then went to a friend, full of self complacency, at his own management—and told him what he had done. G 2 “You counted it?” said his friend. Alas—he had not. He had never thought of that. We laugh at the folly of this man; but how many of us do the same thing? How many temptations do we perpetually offer, in our carelessness, to the poor, and unsettled?—to our servants, and to strangers? What is the evil?—This. We learn to suspect everybody; to have no confidence in any human creature. A judicious circumspection would prevent this. How often do we only suspect a loss; yet, not being certain of it, are fretted vilely by our suspicion, and dishonour all that are near us, by our watchfulness. This may be thought lightly of. But such is my opinion on the subject, that, I would not be the friend of a man, so careless of his property, as not to know when, or where it was stolen from him. I consider every man, in this world, as a lodger in a great inn. It is the privilege of all the guests, that each man should know whom to charge, and with what, when he is pillaged. Else all are wronged. And what was the consequence of this discipline? I became an inveterate thief. I stole whatever I could lay my hands on, unless confidence were put in me, until I was eighteen; and so expert was I, that I have stolen one end of a thing, while the owner was holding on by the other. I broke into my mother's desk; robbed her sweetmeats, pies, shoe-buckles, pantry, money, and spoons: nay, I have clambered into the window of an office, where an uncle of mine lived; and robbed his money box, time and again; and once, of a whole dollar, while I was yet a child. Yet, why relate these felonies?—They grew out of a shameful neglect in my education; great cruelty, and great injustice. Naturally a coward, I was exceedingly inquisitive and curious in my disposition; chiefly, that I might find something to comfort me, when I was afraid—or console me, after I had been whipped. That I am not yet a thief—or something worse than a thief, is no fault of theirs;--- it is not because of their scourging, but—entirely owing to myself. I have learnt to scorn it; or, rather to fear the peril of it. My natural cowardice has got the upper hand of my short sighted fear. The first strong impulse ever communicated to my honesty, was accidental. I had never been trusted; never, from my very cradle. I had, therefore, no character; and no opportunity of acquiring one, for honesty. But a man, with whom I lived, who had never been wise enough to allow me any pocket money; and kept me in such a state of degredation, that I was obliged to ask for everything that I obtained, even to a pair of shoes, though I was of incalculable service to him—until I thought of tearing my clothes, or grinding them through, at the elbows and knees, till they spoke for me, whenever I grew tired of them; as the best way to avoid the intolerable trial that it was for me, to beg, even of my master, what I knew that I deserved;—this man had the good sense, one day, to put me in the way of earning some pocket money, for myself. From that hour, I was honest to him, and afraid to steal. Why did he not think of this before?—A little spending money is as necessary, as food and rest, to every child, who may be surrounded by temptation. It is awkward for him to steal; but, having once reconciled his conscience to the guilt—it is the same thing to him, whether he steal a large, or a small sum. How different was it now! How proud and sensitive I felt, the moment that I had a few paltry and common perquisites allowed to me, by which I could obtain something honestly;—less, to be sure, in a month, than I had been in the habit of stealing in a week—but little, as it was, it was my own; and I slept quietly. Let me say it. I have had some experience—I have been a master, and an apprentice; a tyrant, and a slave; a father, and a son, by turns; and I have always found it cheaper to give high wages at first—a handsome allowance—than to be sordid. They that steal; like them, who let out money at illegal interest, will be paid for the risk of detection and punishment, that they run; and the reputation, that they hazard. A desperate game is to be played desperately. O, it is melancholy, to look back upon the days that are gone; to turn my thought inward, and contemplate the trampled richness; the dishonoured and abused quality of my own heart. It is wonderful to me, that I have any of it left—wonderful that, for the blood and pulse that I feel here now, stimulating me to acts of benevolence and charity,—I should not find the ashes and blackness of a quenched furnace—full of crawling reptiles. A kindlier dealing with me; a more noble and delicate watchfulness, had made me one of the gentlest of human creatures.—Alas! why was there not some guardian, of a benignant temper, to search out, and study—what was really worth studying; and what would have rewarded him, here and hereafter—the hidden and secret fountains of my heart—and then—how soon had all their bitterness passed away. It was not long after this, that I was put in the way of another man, in extensive business;—one of the cursedest liars, and probably, one of the most natural scoundrels, that ever kept the reputation of a decent man, since the world was created. I was tall and manly of my age; and the contract that was made for me, rendered it necessary that I should go naked; or steal and cheat; or clothe myself honestly with forty dollars a year, like a human being. The latter was impossible, althought he man that swore, that his son Ben,—(a stuttering; thick-headed fellow, who managed the concern; and who used to read Curran's speeches, of a cold night in winter, till his hands cracked open, and bled upon the page—not because he had any relish for them, or the capacity to understand them at all; but, merely, that his mother might communicate the tale to some of her gossiping acquaintances)—had clothed himself for less than thirty dollars a year. Nothing could be more probable!—at least, nothing, that you would ever hear out of the father's mouth, from one year's end to the other. Now, what was I to do? To clothe myself, honestly, and decently, with forty dollars a year, was out of the question; though it should be stipulated, that I might have whatever I should want, out of the store, at cost.— It was still harder for me to steal: because my hand had been out for some time; and I felt a prodigious unwillingness to re-commence, so long as I could get along, tolerably well, without it. There was a middle course. Into that, I rushed, like a skilful navigator—saving my conscience, and covering my back, at the same time. It was stipulated, as I have already said, that I should have what I wanted, at cost. It was only necessary, therefore, that I should avail myself of the contract, after the manner which I have since learnt to be the law—that is, altogether in favour of myself—to be clothed as well as I pleased.— Take an example. Suppose that I wanted a pair of shoes. I would go to the shoemaker, and stipulate for a pair, to be paid for, out of the store. Their price would be a couple of dollars, if you please. When I paid him; it was always with some trash, that had been laid in at auction—for my master's whole stock was of that character; and I was always governed by the cost marked upon the outside. Thus, if a lot of different qualities were purchased, they were all marked at the same cost; while some articles, perhaps, were worth five times as much as others. I was always somewhat scrupulous in this matter. I chose the best—sold it at a price, as much above what it cost, as I could—cheated all that I could, in the measure—(though that was expressly against the injunction of Ben—“ne—nev— never cheat, in the m—mea—measure,” said Ben; “it— it—it—it is very unprincipled; if—if you must cheat, che —che—cheat in the price. You won't be—be—be—be found out, th—then;”)— and then cheated in the reckoning—(a hint that I took from the old man; who first undersold a neighbour, one day; and then, made it up on the slate, while I was standing by him.) But, perhaps, all this did not satisfy me. Perhaps I had already overrun, my monthly allowance of three dollars, and thirty-three cents and one third. In such an emergency, though the shoes might have been made, in the way spoken of, to cost me only half a dollar, or so—yet, that was quite too much. They might be managed so as to cost me nothing; nay, so as to put some money into my pocket! But how? I had only to make the man take goods, to a greater amount than the shoes, and pay me the balance. These goods I charged to myself, at cost; and put the profit into my own pocket, and the shoes upon my feet, at the same time. Thus I made forty dollars a year quite a comfortable salary. Pray heaven that you may do it as honestly! How short-sighted are the mean and sordid! If this man had allowed me, for my clothes, eighty or one hundred dollars a year, he would have been better served. I should have been more jealous and true to his interest, and carried my head more proudly; and yet, less insolently, than I did. But he drove me to compound with my conscience; and he had to pay the price of the composition, of course, out of his own pocket. By the way, let me give you some notion of the accomplishments, that a reasonable man may look to obtain for his child, by putting him apprentice to a retail dry goods “merchant;” grocer; or confectioner. In the first place, he is pretty sure to learn how to cheat; next, to lie; next, to steal; to say nothing of the fact, that the very trade is disgraceful to a man—exactly so far as it could be carried on by a woman; for they, when indigent, respectable, and virtuous, have no resource; none at all, sobefitting their condition, as that of shop-keeping. To them, it ought to be left; and men, who presume to sell ribbands, tape, laces, thread, needles, stockings, and linen, ought to be labelled for men-milleners;—mantua-making would be but another branch of the same trade. However, that is not all that a boy will learn at a retail shop—he will learn, ninety-nine times out of one hundred, to pass counterfeit money.— I did. One maxim with my master, was—if he bought the devil, to sell him again. And with whom, is it not a maxim? Another was, never to believe that a counterfeit note—was a counterfeit. Out of these two maxims, grew my conduct; and his. If we received a suspicious looking note, we took care to put it off, immediately, either upon a stranger; a countryman, from the back woods; or a woman; their simplicity, ignorance, forgetfulness; and the probable distance that they would carry it, before they would attempt to pass it, or discover their mistake—being a guarantee that it would not come back to us again. Yet, I have had the same note come back, ten times in a day. And what was the consequence? Did I ever lose a customer by it?— O, no! They always left me, full of gratitude and delight. I would pretend not to recollect the note; and would say, “Well, madam—if you say that you took it of me, I am satisfied. I do not deny that—it—but you are sure of it, you say.” “O, certainly, sir—certainly; if it were the last word, that I had to speak, I would swear to it.” “Very well, madam;—there is good money;—if this be counterfeit, I must lose it;—it is very hard—very; and I am heartily sorry for the trouble that you have had—but—you are sure, you say—and if you were not, why we can better afford to lose it, than you,” &amp;c. “O, God bless you, sir—you are very good,” she would say—the tears probably, standing, in her eyes. She would leave me; and the very next woman that left my store, ten to one, would carry away the same note, again! So much for my apprenticeship. Boys do this from fear, sometimes, when they suspect that they have taken a bad note. Others, from principle. I was of the latter class. I was, after that, in the service of other men. They treated me well; and they are the richer for it. Mine has never been the maxim of the world—to treat them worst, who treat me best. Do I slander the world? I do not. By whom do we suffer? By our friends. A man in debt, or in jail, will pay his mortal enemy, to get out of his power; and borrow the money of a friend —whom he never pays—for the purpose: aye, and let his friend take his place in prison. We dare not take liberties, or ask favours, of them that hate us. We are too proud. Nay, do we not oftener suffer, by having too good, than too bad an opinion, of a man? Whence all these bankruptcies—failures—suicides—and destruction of families—by endorsement—lending money— bail, and securityship? They all come from our friends. We lose nothing in this way, by our enemies. Nobody —neither man nor woman—ever suffered from distrusting anybody. Yet, mine has been a contrary maxim— open war, or real peace. It matters little which. If I called a man friend, there was meaning in it. He was not to be my victim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. Early History...Observation...Incidents...Retrospect...Becomes a clerk in a store...Temptations...Trails...Mortifications...Characters...Education...Advice...The trunk...The portmanteau ...Reflections...Curiosity...Advice to parents. I have lived to experience one of the most extraordinary revolutions, in prejudice, that has, probably, ever happened. When I was a young man, I was always treated best, by them that knew least of me.— Since then, it has been directly the reverse. Then, my first appearance had, usually, a striking effect; (I speak of my apprenticeship;) for, as I said before, I was tall and manly: but I found a lamentable falling off, on every day's acquaintance, in the consideration with which I was treated. How different has it been since! My acquaintances have hated me, and slandered me;—people that I had met once, and only for a moment, never could bear to hear, afterward, my name mentioned; while there were a few, intimate with me—male and female—a very few—who would; aye, and will yet, spill their blood for me. I remember when I went home, for the first time, to the house of my new master;—the man who gave me forty dollars a year, and cold dinners, for taking care of a large establishment, under his great booby of a son. It was to dine. Ben was my companion, for that day; and, when I entered the room, there was an involuntary movement of surprise in the women. They were not prepared to expect a fellow of my size and appearance; and I was not a little amused at their embarrassment. There was a good deal of whispering, and fidgetting; and an entire new arrangement of the cloth. Ben and I, for that day, were seated at a side table. That was by way of condescension toward me! It was very ill-judged; for we could never occupy the same level. It was not in the nature of things; and I should have been happier then, to be beneath him, than H with him. You can have no idea of his obstinate, piteous, money-making stupidity; and yet, he had no notion that it was possible to be a greater man than he expected to be. I remember a letter, that he once wrote, to a little she cousin of his;—a fine girl, too, upon my word—(I have often thought of her since, with pleasure and respect.) A copy of it fell into my hands. He talked very feelingly in it, I remember, about “the leprosy, in which commerce had lain, for so long a time!” Well!—for the first day, Ben was permitted to dine with me; and I was permitted to dine at a side table;— but the next, Ben, after some shuffling, went home with his father, to dinner—leaving me to watch the store; and when he came back, after some apologies, I took my turn. But my turn continued to be—to go last, I found—happen what would; and, after the first week, I heard nothing more of apologies:—and all the involuntary deference, which the mother—a notable, good, rational sort of a woman, in her way—or the young lady, above mentioned, had shown, at my entrance, soon wore away, into quite a slip-shod kind of indifference. But there it stopped. They were not quite willing to yawn, or go to bed, in my face. Yet, why was this? What had I done? Nothing. My deportment was above my age; and, had I been a stranger to them, they could not have forborn, for their souls, to rise, every day, when I entered the room, as they did, the first day. But, a worldly policy; that vulgar cunning, which is constitutional with the vulgar, soon led them to another course. They were afraid of setting me above my business. Poor simpletons! And yet, I can look back, with pleasure, upon that year's novitiate; and recal the deep and continual mortification, that I endured, more than once; with a sentiment of pride. Even then, I felt that my destiny was not with them. I knew that I was born to command better earth, than that, of which their souls were made. I knew that the time must come, when, even to be judged by me, as I now judge these people, would be an honour to them, of which they would speak boastingly:—and I used to go to my bed, week after week, the moment that I left the tea-table; and lie there; meditating upon the apparitions that came out, and went back again, into the beautiful blue darkness that was about me—like continual eruptions of colour and brightness; while the heavens above me, showered their stars upon the earth, like the blossoms of a fig-tree, shaken by a great wind.—(Revelations, iv. 13.) Yet, the mother was kind to me, on more than one occasion; and the father, never—I must say that for him—never once wounded my feeling; but the son—he was afraid of me—afraid as death—although he did not know it, himself. And well that it was so. Once, and once only, was he nigh putting his hand upon me; he came round from the counter to do it; but he caught my look; he heard my low voice; and he shook, from head to foot. The cause I well remember. A young brother of his—after ten thousand childish, but wicked pranks; such as greasing my clothes, (for which his mother cuffed him soundly once, all about the breakfast room, in my presence—and for which, I imagine that he never forgave me)—and thwarting me every way that he could—he had the audacity to strike me. This, I never could bear. I had born such things; but that time had gone by;—and I whipped him—unwillingly, I confess; but I whipped him, nevertheless. He rushed upon me with brick-bats, until I was obliged to let a little blood out for him. He complained to Ben; and Ben began to bully and splutter—while the spittle flew, in a shower, over the desk. But there it stopped. He did not strike me; and I was retained in the store till the year was up; and then, packed off, quite civilly. I expected it.--A few words more, on this part of my apprenticeship. Among the most severe and cutting of these mortifications, were two or three, that I never shall forget.— My blood boiled; and the tears that gushed out of my eyes, when I was in bed, almost blistered my cheeks. I wanted to go to church with them, once; but they were ashamed to sit in the pew with me—and almost said so. That was one. The second was worse. The mother had often permitted me to come into the room, when she had company; and, ugly and ungraceful as I was, there was, even then, more of natural gentility, ten thousand times over, in me, than in all her unlicked cubs, together—not excepting Ben, who was, beyond all comparison, the most truly ludicrous machine; the most entirely awkward contrivance, that I ever met with—in breeches. On one occasion, she gave a ball. Two little junketting rooms were thrown open—for the lady was fond, very fond, of company; and cake and wine are plenty enough—and cost nothing, you know, where the husband of a woman is a grocer—and his wife, a good manager. The people jumped, and stewed; and wriggled, and shuffled; first, up the room—and then, down, to my infinite astonishment. I had never seen any dancing before; and I loved to look at the fools. In a little time, without intending it, I had hustled myself in among the patricians. Just then, the good lady was kind enough to come, stuttering, up to me—(for she stuttered a little, too)—her pretty, shining black eyes snapping fire—and hint to me, that—that—it—it— she—she—in short, that she had per—permitted me to stand at the door; and look in; and—and—that—in short—I had better be off. What a damper! On another occasion,—the old man had too much heart; and Ben, I suppose, too little, to speak to me of it—after two or three family consultations—the old lady—no, that's wrong—she is not old, yet—took me to task, for a couple of new linen shirts, that had been found in the wash—as if she would like to know how I came by them. That was devilish hard. I had left off stealing. The shirts were fairly mine. I had charged the linen to myself, some months before; and— and, in short, I made her, and all the family ashamed enough of their suspicions. Now, what had I to keep me honest? Suspect any man of being a scoundrel; and it is the surest way in the world, of making him one. Be careful how you suspect; but never—never, betray your suspicion to one, who is to remain in your service, unless you are prepared to prove his guilt. I was greatly tempted to vengeance—yet, I forbore. My own manhood kept me honest—nothing else.—Pshaw! it was not manhood—it was cowardice. The risk of stealing, then, had begun to frighten me. Here were other examples of folly, in the education that I received. They tried to humble me. They could not. They were ashamed of themselves—but they never made me ashamed. I deserved to be treated with respect and affection. I was not. They began, as they could not continue. I smiled; for I saw the meaning of it all. They were afraid to arouse me at once, by the indignity of a cold dinner, at a second table. Nay, they were ashamed. They had'nt the courage to offer it to me, after seeing me. But, gradually, by contemplating my salary, and forgetting me, they brought themselves down to it; and I was treated with indignity, by the very women that trembled before me, when they first saw me. I had a good heart; but I had no experience in the ways of the world. I had a stout hand; but I knew not the mischief that might be done with it. In proof of the former, I would allude to the fact, that I lay awake several hours, for an opportunity to bid a shop-keeping brother of hers, (I mean the girl,) good bye, the last night that he spent with the family; and that, when I did—it seemed to be a liberty, that the blockhead could not understand;—and, again, that when she was going away, I remember standing an hour, in the cold and darkness, for an opportunity to say farewell to her— merely because, one evening, when we happened to be alone together, she had the wisdom to treat me like a companion. That—but no matter. I have seen her since; and in a situation, when she charged me with feeling no disposition to acknowledge the acquaintance. I do not like these things. Begin, as you can hold out, is my maxim; or, at least, never grow worse, or do worse, as you grow older. If you take boarders, give them, the first day, a worse dinner than usual; rather than a better one. If you are newly married, remember the maxim:—you may be ruined else—bankrupt— without any credit to yourself. So, in all the business H 2 of life:—husband your resources and friendship. If you are lavish at first, your wife, your friend, and yourself, will soon have to go to the side table; and then, to a cold dinner. Beware! A word more of myself, now—by way of a change. One of my strongest peculiarities through life, has been an incessantly active spirit of inquiry. In my boyhood, it was little else than a meddling, curious, impertinent inquisitiveness, without object or aim, beyond a present momentary gratification;—but, as I grew up, it took a more alarming shape.—It haunted me like some unburied creature; it set me meditating upon forbidden things—interrogatingGod—dissecting—analyzing, and torturing into expression, whatever I came near, that had life in it. It set wandering, with a scornful step, through all the geography of heaven. For this, I have been guilty—so guilty, that I have no hope left, except in the infinite compassion of my Maker.— Nay—this it is—an insatiable spirit of investigation, which grew up out of my cowardice—and an anxiety to protect myself in any way, from the common perils of life—I was afraid to sin openly—to inquire, boldly —as other men did;—to oppose, or resist, or retaliate aggression upon the spot, like the brave-blooded:—and, therefore, I became so active and intense, in my secret searching after the means of defence—like them that defend themselves, and attack others, by poison, because they are not valiant enough, nor strong enough, of arm or heart, to make battle openly—this it is, to which I owe all that is good, as well as all that is evil in my life. It has made me a husband and a father—a lover of many women—the explorer of many hearts—a traveller through all Europe—the spoiler of many a blessed creature; many a shrine of purity—and left me— blind and broken hearted—widowed, houseless, and fatherless—nay, childless, even in my maturity— but better, I believe; and wiser in my sorrow, and bereavement, than I should have been, even, with a crown upon my temples, and a sceptre in my hand—with which I could break in pieces—whatever I smote;—and smite, whatever I would. But let me not anticipate the tale. It is one of much trial. May it be one of instruction! It is one of much sorrow, and tribulation; may they that meet with it, learn to be tender in their administration of power! to deal gently, and dispassionately, with whatever hath been made weaker, and more delicate than themselves!— to repress an unhallowed curiosity—and to love—more temperately—less distractedly, than I have loved, either my wife, or my children—I must pause. I must recollect myself. There are incidents of my early life, which, though apparently trivial in themselves, at the time of their happening, have had a perpetual and continually augmenting influence upon my destiny. They ought to be told; and, whenever they occur to my memory, they shall be told, although I have to go back every moment, in my narrative. I have spoken of my active, investigating spirit. Two or three examples of my character, when it first appeared, will be a clue to much that has taken place in my history since. Whatever happened that was mysterious, troubled me like a brain-fever, till I was at the bottom of it. Whatever was difficult, yet possible, to be done, I was sure to attempt, if left to the goading of my own spirit. These principles of action are still at full spring within me. When about eight or nine years old, I was taken into the counting-room—no, I may as well out with the truth at once—taken into the back room of a retail shop, where tape and pins were speculated upon, by the merchants, with the solemnity of people engaged in a South Sea; Tulip; or Mississippi scheme. I was of little use—except in the summer time, when my chief employment was stealing fruit from a fine garden, just in the rear of our store—tearing out my corduroy trowers; and rummaging the shop, from garret to cellar, whenever I was left alone in it, for a moment. One day—I never shall forget it—there was a big leathern trunk in the store, to which I had seen one of the concern, go, so often, and so regularly, that, I felt an immoderate desire of imitating his example, on the very first opportunity. It soon arrived. There was a cry of fire!—fire!—in the street. Away went my masters—locking me up, as usual. I waited just long enough to get my breath; flew at the trunk,—wrenched it open,—emptied it all over the floor;—and proceeded to distribute, and arrange for inspection, a heap of tattered billet-doux— old clothes—pattern cards—torn books—fishing tackle —scraps of drawing—&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. They were, where I sat, about as high as my ears, on each side of me. I looked at the whole, with the eyes of an Alchymist. My ancient curiosity was about to be thoroughly gratified. I was almost afraid to begin the search; I paused, and held back—to indulge myself with looking at the treasure before me—like a glutton, or a miser —who feeds all his senses; but, only one of them at a time;—or, rather, like the voluptuary—touching and tasting—till his appetite is all on fire. At last, I broke the spell. I rose from my knees, and fell to work.— The first things, that I laid my hand on, were some three pronged fish hooks;—with leaden sinkers—these, I appropriated to myself, at once, without further ceremony; merely on account of their workmanship; for, I did'nt know what they were; and had no idea of their use. The next thing, that underwent examination, was a drawing, coloured most shamefully, in imitation of a landscape, upon a waiter, borrowed by my junior master, from our next door neighbour; of whom, more, by and by. To this, was attached the picture of a house— painted upon a card—with a pretty, little, white railing in front, which had mightily tickled me, I knew, some weeks before; for, as soon as my said master had completed it, I had asked him for it, in vain. The temptation was hard to resist. It was a paltry thing, to be sure; and, as well I can remember now, so badly contrived, that, if my little boy had painted so wretchedly, at seven years old, I would have had him impaled alive, for it; still, it was the house that I had asked for, and been refused. It was hard to leave it—and yet, if I took it, I must be prepared for a stout examination, and denial; for, it was, next to his own finger nails, upon which he spent half his time, the dearest thing under heaven, probably, to my young master. I could'nt determine —I had a great mind to put it by, along with the fish hooks and sinkers; and then, again, I resolved to leave it; but somehow or other, I always found it in my hand again; at the end of every soliloquy; and so, I laid it by, with the fish hooks; for future consideration. In the mean time, the fire was all out—the bells had stopped ringing, and the people were tramping home, in every direction; but, I heard nothing of them, and saw nothing, except the house. By and by, I had the courage to break a string, that bound up a packet of neatly folded paper, written all over. That was a treat indeed. It was the daily journal of a man, for years, who never had more than one idea in his head, at a time; nor, any other experience in the ways of the world; or, in the adventures and vicissitudes of life, than any shop-boy may learn, who has grown old, in travelling from one counter to another; to dinner, and bed, and supper; and back again. Yet there were some precious secrets to be found some, that my fingers itch to relate; even at this late day; and, a multitude of such weighty incidents, as the following:—“Monday, June 3, 18—. Bought a new pair of gloves.—Saw Miss A. B....— Tuesday, 4—discovered an improvement in egg blacking.—Took tea at Mrs. C..d's.—Letter from home. Wednesday, 5—had my top boots mended, by Gage, so that it appeared, as if a bullet had gone through them. Thursday, 6—bad cold. Friday, 7—running away, at the nose. Saturday, 8—can't keep up with it.” &amp;c. &amp;c. My profane hand next fell upon a love letter.—I had just opened it— saw the words “Dear Timothy”—and turned toward the light, that—curse it,—was there a sudden eclipse?—I looked up. There was my master, standing over me—with the pleasantest countenance in the world. How long he had been there, heaven only knows; but I know that I never felt so like a fool, in all my life. “Bill,” said he, at last—going into the next room, “will you be kind enough to put the letters and things back into the trunk, when you have done with them?” “That I will!” thought I—quaking like delicate machinery, with some wild animal in it;—and in, I tumbled all the rubbish, pellmell, neads and points; and, prepared myself for being spitted and roasted, alive, at least. But, God help the fool!—I never heard another word about it. And yet—mark me, reader—the shame that I felt on that occasion, was worth a dozen whippings. Had the man, who was really amiable, called me to him, when he was alone; put his hand upon my head, and spoken to me, as I would speak to a child now, whom I had so caught among my trumpery, I should never have sinned again, upon this earth. But no—nothing was said about it; and I was left to imagine—either, that some tremendous punishment was brewing for me; or that my transgression was quite too trivial for remembrance, or notice. It was not. I should have been made to feel that it was not—by a whip, not of substantial scorpions—but by one, that I should have felt, to my dying days—one, that would have left a young serpent in every wound—and, every wound upon my brain. But, what was the consequence? My infernal appetite for meddling was not to be quenched. I ransacked, whatever I found hidden, or locked, without mercy; spoiling, as if it were lawful, whatever were shut up from me. Not long after this, I had just such another escape. I had been sent, with a small portmanteau, to the stage-office. It belonged to a gentleman, whom I left talking, at the store. I ran as fast as I could, to gain a little time, for my purpose; I then turned a corner; and popped down, behind a pile of shingles, to examine the portmanteau. I had just got my right hand thoroughly to the bottom, when I heard some one sing out —“Halloa, there!”—just above me. I had half a mind to vanish on the spot, without looking up, to see what the noise came from; for, I remembered the trunk; and it always had been my cursed fate, on such occasions, to be intruded upon. “Providence had always set itself against me, face and eyes”—but, I could'nt get my hand out. At length, I succeeded; and stammered out a lamentable story, about having dropped a knife into it, which—but, no matter, it was a clumsy lie for me to tell, young as I was. But, alas!—the cruellest thing of all, was, that I had to continue the walk, side by side, with the owner—for half an hour longer; and truly, I never suffered so much in my life. —At a yet later period, I suffered in a similar way.— I had made up my mind once, to appropriate to myself, a pair of blue cloth pantaloons, to which I had taken a fancy, in a gentleman's wardrobe; for whom I had been writing—and who had been very civil to me. I knew that they would fit me; for he was a well made fellow; and I had already worn out one pair for him. I knew when he was not there. I entered boldly; and went directly toward the closet.—What could I say for myself? There he was! just where I had left him, the night before—as if he had'nt stirred since. Indeed! indeed!—it was very disagreeable. It was like finding your conscience or courser restive, just in the wrong place, after a deal of training. The same unhallowed curiosity, hath since led me into matters of a more frightful seriousness. I have done rummaging trunks and portmanteaus; but—heaven forgive me!—I have ransacked hearts and bed-chambers; intruded upon the holiest places of the holiest temples—paid midnight visits—of darkness and death—and—but they are past. Heaven, I hope, hath pardoned me; and the fierce instinct of my being; this old, sleepless spirit of investigation, trial, fear, and experiment, is now employed upon higher and holier offices, —I hope. Was it unwisely given?—this investigating disposition? No. But it was suffered to run to waste; and, what had been a fountain of immortality, watched over, visited, and purified, reflecting the magnificence of heaven—the setting and the rising sun—the starry annals of the sky, at midnight;—untouched, unguided, had well nigh stagnated to a deadly poison. So it is, with all our blessings. They, that are the most powerful—when abused, are the most terrible. It is safer to trifle with many inferiour faculties; to profane many an ordinary endowment—than to darken, or stay the revolution, for one instant, of the greater luminaries of the mind. It is they, that, suddenly quenched, drop darkness and mildew upon men! It is they, that, if they shed not light, shed pestilence! That spirit of inquiry—that, which led Newton into heaven, and set him walking with the twenty-four ancients, familiarly, among the stars;—that, which, unannounced, and unprepared, set the blind Milton, face to face, with Jehovah;—that, which led Bacon and Locke, unharmed, unappalled, into the darkest habitations of the human heart—till they were able to trace out the burning path-way of every passion—the route to dominion, of every habit—the secret operation of every hidden, and lurking spirit, that haunted them;— even that is it, which, unheeded or mocked at, hath led to the commission of more atrocities, than almost any other propensity, in the nature of man. You may estimate the virtue of every thing, by its malignity and destructiveness, when perverted. Parents!—Beware how you stifle this early curiosity. You had better take out the brains of your children, at once. Beware, too, how you look with indifference upon its first movements. They may make your heart swell with thankfulness; or bring down your grey hairs, with sorrow, to the grave. Hearken to me; and you will soon learn, of what tremendous efficacy it is, when rightly directed; and how deadly, and terrible, when abused.</field>

Matters and things in general...Memory of the senses...Tricks of authorship...Anecdotes...My Mother...Thieving...Education ...Reasoning...Advice to parents...Stuck to my seat...Schools ...Windham...Famished...Academy...Barefooted...Revenge ...Dream. I have chosen my course. It has ended, where, if I had foreseen that it would end, ten years ago, I should have gone mad upon the spot; and rushed into the presence of Jehovah, with a cry of desolation. “Why hast thou created me! Lo, I am returned to thee!—unbidden!” I should have said;—“for I cannot abide thy appointment!” Yes, I have chosen my course—tied up my own hands—thrown myself down, like some detestable thing, upon the dust and ruin of all that I have loved. Shall the tale be told? It shall. But how to tell it! Shall I begin with a recapitulation of all the fiery and sore plagues, that have been visited upon me; the devils, that have beset my path; the apparitions, that have baited me, day and night, from my very boyhood? Shall I do this; and then, retread my steps to the causes—cause after cause, that have led to it? Could you follow me? No.— Your heart would fail you. You would never believe; you could not, that such wreck and devastation, could have been the consequence of such trivial and distant events. Let me begin then, before you are alarmed; and lead you forward, step by step, from the first delicate link, to the massy iron of the last—the last!—how know I, that the last link is yet wrought?—how know I, that the next will not weigh me down to the earth? Nay, deeper than the earth? Yea, that shall be my course. I will not begin, by terrifying you. I will begin at the smaller end. Whoever you are, reader, I defy you to throw down the book, till you have trodden I to the conclusion. Yea, though it be with me, over plough-shares hissing with blood—serpents—and live embers. There are two ways. I have chosen the simplest— the most effectual. Our object may be the same; and the routes, apparently, the same; when, by one, we never can arrive to it:—and, by the other, we shall arrive, at once. My memory frightens me—yet, I cannot tell why. The scenes of my early life, are all vivid before me—yet, I cannot describe them. How incomprehensible! you exclaim. Do you understand any other language than your own? Latin, for example?—or French? You are able to read it, we will suppose, readily, and at a glance.— A page of French is given to you. You translate it, at once. But the page of English, the same that you have just written, is offered to you again, to return into French. Can you do it? No. Can you give a reason? No. You only know, that you cannot do it. It appears very strange to the inexperienced. What; say they;—you cannot translate English into French! and can, French into English! How is this? You could not do the last, unless you knew and remembered the words. But, if you know and remember the words, what prevents you from doing the first? Thus will people reason, on what they do not understand. They have never learnt that each sense has its memory; each faculty, its retentiveness—its reminiscence; a mode of receiving and communicating impressions peculiar to itself. The mind slumbers.— The memory of abstract thought dies away. But the senses are startled into exquisite life, years and years, after the mind has lost its hold upon things, by some sweet perfume; some cadence; some vapour; some touch; or some taste; some colour, or expression. Apply this. The eyes remember the words, when the mind has forgotten them. There is a self-arranging power in all language; a spirit that seeks affinity, ease, and harmony, too, which the ear remembers. But the eyes must see, and the ears hear these things, before they will recollect them. As well might one be called upon to remember, and describe an odour, or a heavenly pair of eyes, so that another should smell the one, and see the other, as he did, long after they had gone away from him; with no fragrance, and no eyes near, to compare them to;—as that he should speak in a foreign language, as readily as he can read it. But there are some, I hope, who are acquainted with no language but their own; but then, I hope too, that they are well acquainted with that. I will try to make them comprehend the mystery, that we may remember, what one cannot repeat. You hear a song. Do you not remember it? You do. Can you repeat a word of it. No. Nay, more:—you have set out, play after play, at the theatre. You are unable to repeat a line—you forget even the name of the author, and the characters. Yet, how quickly do you detect an interpolation. You do not know what is in the play; but you know what is not in it. Which requires the greatest memory? You cannot remember Milton. Yet, nobody could pass off another's poetry, upon you, for his. Nay, you are able to read and relish the beauties of Shakspeare. Can you write like him? No. You think this absurd. But recollect yourself. You wonder that a person, who can read and relish a French author, should be unable to write French. Where is the difference? Does not this prove to you, that you may remember a thing, without knowing it; nay, without being able to recollect, or describe it. How do you know your acquaintances, when you meet them, after a long absence? It is the habit of your senses; not the recognition of your mind. It is not the memory of your mind; for, if it were, you would find ideas and words for it. Can you describe—can you give to another—any notion of the process, by which you arrive at the recognition of them? You cannot. Am I still incomprehensible? Do you not see, that, although I may remember every thing that has happened during all my life, yet I cannot repeat it. You may have the same object. There may be two routes, plain, and common, and direct to your view.— Yet, one only may lead you to it. Take another case. You meet with a strange word, in some foreign language. Let us suppose it, in the Italian. You are desirous of finding out what it means. Two routes are before you; two, alike certain and direct, to the inexperienced. You have two dictionaries. One is of Italian words, with English definitions; the other, of English words, with Italian definitions. To which will you refer? If you take up the latter, you may spend a twelvemonth in the search; and not find the word at last. If the former, you get it directly. Yet, in both cases, you are ignorant of Italian. Yet, what multitudes in life, are in the habit of looking into the Italian dictionary! When I see a young girl, newly married—about to— Here I intended to introduce an original essay, that I had by me, after the manner of Franklin's whistle; but, I have thought better of it. And, beside—I—I intended to enter into a deep speculation upon the present fashions of teaching—throw in some strictures upon Locke, &amp;c. &amp;c.;—but all that may come in, better, and more naturally, by and by. I look back on what I have written. I ask myself, what on earth, this long essay on the senses, has to do with the subject? And then, I comfort myself with the reflection, that it is ingenious; and so altogether after the present fashion of writing, that I can't, for my soul, make up my mind to leave it out. Awkwardly introduced, it is, I confess; but, open a page, a single page, of any writer, ancient or modern, and I will show you some matter, as foreign —though more adroitly dovetailed, perhaps, into the main subject. Have you never had a lady quote half a dozen languages at you, in one letter? You have. Go to your dictionaries. Tumble them over, and you will find, that she has copied the phrases, there given as examples. Did they grow[3] [3] See quotations in the Port Folio—no matter where they occur, since the present Editor has had it in hand, for illustrations.—Ed. out of her subject? No—the subject grew out of them. However, reader, I promise to play no more such tricks with you. But, what can be done, now? This, and this only.— The essay does'nt fit the tale; let us make the tale fit the essay. My object was to hitch in some illustrations, that were by me; and I should be ashamed of having left out, what they were meant to illustrate, were it not the commonest practice in the world, with all the best writers of the age. One would think, that they kept a common place book—and then counted it off, into chapters, cantos, or essays. But let me see. The matter may not be so desperate, after all. I have only to discover, or imagine some connexion, between my thought, and this episode upon the senses; memory; dictionaries, and languages. Stay—I have it. Two ways were left to me—to tell my sorrow; and then, to lead you back, barefooted, over the ground that I had tracked with my blood, in my weary, weary pilgrimage, to the cause:—or, I might begin with the cause, and lead you onward, year after year, with me, to all their tremendous consequences.— In either case, by retreading the same path, the memory of each sense would be active. A thousand associations would be awakened upon the spot, that would have slumbered, for ever, had I remained in my room. Beside, there would be a natural and mechanical recollection, as there is, in beginning at the top of the alphabet, and reciting it in the order that is learnt—to facilitate my progress—when, no matter how well I was acquainted with it, it would be exceedingly difficult and irksome, to say it backward. Thus hath it been with me, in determining which of the two methods I should adopt, on this occasion. To the unthinking, one were as easy as the other.— To me, there was a mighty difference. I was willing to show it—not by telling the truth; for that, I am forbidden to speak—but by looking for analogy into other matters. I have found it. I have shown that there may be an inconceivable difference in two routes, which appear alike. And now, if you please, I'll go to bed.—Q. E. D. I 2 I was always remarkable for trick and expedient. Darn one hole, and I broke out at another. Smoke me out of this hiding place, and I haunted the next. It was impossible to imprison or suffocate me. The example above, is in point. Let me go back awhile; and show you the consequence of suspicion and artifice. They lead to artifice. Villany begets villany. My mother used, sometimes, to send me to the store room, where the mince-pies, dough-nuts, short-cake, smoked herrings, apples, and sweetmeats, were kept— for something or other; but, always with, a vehement injunction that I should meddle with neither. I should have obeyed her, I am sure, had she trusted to her own interdict. But she did not. She began a game of artifice. It was plot and counterplot, with me; and I always prevailed at that game, with this difference— that, if she had let me alone, I should have stolen only a few sweetmeats; or a few apples; or a pocket full of nuts; or a piece of pie; or, perhaps, neither;—whereas, by hedging me in with so many stratagems, she made it indispensable for me to steal whole jars, and whole pies. How was it? She would bid me whistle all the time that I was gone, so that she might hear me; and, when I returned, she would look at my lips, and question me, and smell of my breath, notwithstanding.— What could I do? I whistled away, like a brave fellow, up stairs and down—taking care to put a whole jar of preserves; or a whole pie, outside of the door, while I was whistling; so that I might lay my hand on it again, when I wanted to, without the embarrassing preliminary, of lock and key, &amp;c. It had been better for her, if she had left me to steal a mouthful or two, by way of toll, as you see. Would that all were as honest as I! How their confessions would startle the world! For my own part, I cannot help repeating, that a parent is never so mistaken, as when he invites a child to competition in cunning. In the first place, he is sure to be outwitted, in the long run; for the faculties of the child are constantly improving; and he is never so artless, or so easily deceived, as the parent supposes. How often will you see a little fellow, who can hardly speak a word, leave his playthings; and sit stock still, in the middle of the floor, to listen to the gossipping of his mother?—and that, too, when she is endeavouring to impose upon him. He knows that he is the subject of conversation; and that, he is not to know it. What is the train of thought in his little mind?—this:—that language may have more meanings than one;—that it is lawful to speak so that different hearers may understand you differently. What a lesson for the pure and unpractised mind! No—this will never do. In cunning, we are no match for our children. Would you make yours ingenious? Be so, yourself. Brave?—calm?—steady?—set them the example. Passionate?—mean?—shuffling? Your example is sufficient. It was by such foolish and wicked lessons, that I was taught. There is nothing evil in me, prodigal as my evil qualities are, and productive as they have been; which may not be traced, distinctly and certainly, to some wickedness or folly of them, that had charge of my education. What there is good in me, I owe to God alone; and, next to Him, to my sister Elizabeth. The one gave me a heart, and the other kept it from perishing. One or two other little incidents, and I shall abandon this part of my detail. There was a large and beautiful garden, just in the rear of our house. It was full of fruit trees, currant, and gooseberry bushes. I had explored it often; but all my affections, at last, began to concentrate upon a fine old English gooseberry bush. At one of my periodical visits—I have always been noted for method except in conversation and mathematicks—I heard a gate open at the further end of the garden. I peeped out from my hiding place; but it was altogether too late to escape. The proprietor— one of your old-fashioned gentry, kind-hearted, and full of humour—hove in sight, with a magistrate hanging upon his arm—a magistrate! I shivered with affright. What was I to do? The fence was close by. I could run up, like a squirrel, over a pile of bean poles that lay upon it—and escape, before they could lay a finger upon me. But then, I should be seen; and a stop would be put to my intimacy with the gooseberry bush—a thing, that I could not bear to think of—till apples were ripe. I put my hand to my pockets—they were full; to my hat—that was full; to my waistband— that was full;—I could'nt have swallowed another dozen, I verily believe, had it been to save my life; and I was ready to bawl with vexation, because I could not. They were now at hand; and I cuddled up, under the bush, like a hare, squatting in her form. They affected not to see me, till they were close upon me. Why? It was a trick, and I knew it. I saw it, by their affected countenances, and broken conversation. They wanted to catch me, alive. At last, the owner fetched a great start—and I crawled out—to my unspeakable mortification. Reader, have you ever backed out of anything?[4] [4] Like the rat, out of his breeches, lately, at Providence, R. L—Ed. —no matter what—do you remember how like a fool you looked?—or felt? Here was a fair game between us. He had lied, once, by pretending not to see me; and he lied again, by pretending to mistake me for some wild animal. So, I flew to my penknife story;—my best one, for such an occasion;—told him that I had just lent it to a boy—that he would'nt give it back—that I had had a scuffle with him, for it—that he threw it over the fence—that I jumped over, after it—that I heard the gate open; and saw him coming—that I was afraid that he might suspect me of being a thief; a thing, that I could not bear to think of—and that, therefore, I hid myself under the gooseberry bush. So saying, I produced the knife, in confirmation; and he bade me depart in peace; winking, as he did, at the other. Why did he wink? I felt that it was a compliment to my ingenuity. Instead of being ashamed, therefore, of the lie that I had told, I was proud of it. Heaven forgive that man! He did much toward confirming me in the basest of all vices—that of lying. God! what a coward I was!— why had'nt I the courage to own the truth? Little mortifications, too, are sometimes cruelly felt by children. Things, that men laugh at, will make the little heart—aye, and the small temples too, of a generous child—ache with mortification. I remember a case. It was my fate, to go the rounds among all the schoolmasters of the country. Among others, there was a prodigiously tall, stout fellow of the neighbourhood, who, at first, took a mighty fancy to me; but, in time, partly I do believe, to revenge himself for it, as if I had been a voluntary accomplice in the deception; he turned right about; and distinguished me, by a double portion of austerity and unkindness. I bore both without quailing. I had that in me then, that told me what was wrong in another, sometimes, it may be, before it told me, what was wrong in myself. My soul rose against oppression—for he did oppress me. But nothing ever affected me so sensibly—no, nothing!— and I was with him for a long time—as the following little incident. It was hot weather. I was a restless, incessantly moving creature—as if all my veins ran with quicksilver. A boy put a quantity of shoemaker's wax upon my seat, while I was away. I sat down upon it, without perceiving it. It melted; and, when I arose, I lifted up the seat with me. A tremendous ripping and cracking followed. The girls all laughed; and the boys hourraed. My face was all in a blaze.— The master desired to know what the matter was. His eyes flashed fire. I already heard the cries of the culprit, in anticipation. “Well, sir,” said he, “what is all this about?” “Jo—Jo—Joe Lee, sir,” said I, “has been putting sh—shoemaker's wax upon the seat; and—I—I—I can't get up!” Here was a case of peril! I would'nt have been in Joe Lee's skin, just then, for a trifle. But, alas! alas! a joke popped into the master's head; and, as no two things could be there at the same moment—though it was no fool of a head—for size, I mean—though I would'nt say that it was no head of a fool—and his wrath popped out, like—like—whatever you please, reader. “Well,” said he, “I am really glad that anything can keep you to your seat, Bill Adams.” As he said this, he gave the signal, by laughing himself, like a good fellow. In all cases of doubt, you know, it is the master's prerogative to laugh first; and then, the whole school roared again, according to custom. By heaven, the hot, fine tears, spirted out of my eyes, like oil from a squeezed lemon peal. I cried for vexation;—even I! that would'nt have cried, if I had been stripped naked, and lashed with vipers, till my bones were bare. What was the consequence of this unthinking merriment? I was laughed at, on all sides—hooted at—and obliged to fight. I was afraid as death of Joe Lee; but a quarrel grew out of my fear of him, which lasted till poor Joe was in his grave—for I was afraid to forgive him. Nay, more—I began to nourish such a mortal antipathy against the master, that I had some serious designs of blowing up his desk with gunpowder; and did, actually, begin to hate another boy, a quaker, who sat on the same seat with me, merely because he was a favourite of the master; wrote a better hand than I; was permitted to study French, when I was not; and wore shoes, while I was obliged to go barefooted. That feeling was carried so far, that, though he was one of the most truly inoffensive creatures that ever lived—a little older and larger than myself—that I waylaid him, one day; and fell upon him; and tried hard, but in vain, to beat him soundly. He defended himself with two stones, which he held in his hands— and dealt about him, awkwardly enough, to be sure; but with such effect, that I was fain to abandon my purpose. There is another lesson to people in authority. Why, for the gratification of a little childish vanity, was a boy permitted to escape, when he deserved a severe flogging? Why was another mortified, with a joke, at the natural expense of so much malignity and bitterness? Yet, that is often done. Children are mortified by people, as books are sometimes damned, by reviewers; because they are tempted by a pun, or a joke; or happen to have a “bloody severe thing,” unappropriated, in their noddles. It was my misfortune, for two winters, to be the inmate of another place of punishment—a sort of quaker boarding-school—established at a little rascally country place, called Windham, a dozen miles, or so, from my home. Here, the chief employment of the scholars, to the best of my recollection, was snow-balling; whittling pine blocks into boxes; hunting up fir-balsam, for the mistress, who was affected with some complaint; sliding; eating water-gruel;—bread that corresponded, exactly, with the leprosy, which is described in Leviticus; being full of red and black plague spots; and cold beans. That we read, and wrote, occasionally; and learnt definitions out of the dictionary—not in it—cannot be denied. But, gracious heaven!—the misery and weariness of spirit; the poverty and famine of the very heart, that I endured there—make me, even at this moment, in my warm study, with a bright fire at my side, feel as if I had been shipwrecked, when I was a child, upon some desolate island. Would it be believed, that, so scantily were we nourished, at that school; and that, so sordid and base were the superintendents; that I have seen three large boys, squabbling like famished wolves, over a salt fish skin, that had been shrivelled upon the coals? Yet, upon my word, it is true. And I, myself, stood by, with my mouth watering to participate. I did, by heaven and earth! What should be expected of human beings, who have been so abused, under the name of education? Is it wonderful, that they recur to the period of it, as to one, of torture and death; a season of detestable, and unappeasable longing? How many unnatural appetites grew up, think you, among a school of boys, whose aliment was so atrocious? I know not. But this I know,—that, since, while I have wandered through the apartments of the building; and paused upon the places of my several transgressions, there—and looked about me—I have wondered to see it, standing yet! I have asked myself, why some of the young banditti, that were trained in it, have not made it their lurking place, till it was—a refuge only for the rattle-snake, and the wild beast—blackened—smoked—riven—and blasted! How diminished the house appeared to me, when I last saw it! Once, it was boundless. I had seen little that was larger among the habitations of men. But I returned to it. Could it be? I asked myself. I felt as if I could stand in the middle, and touch the four walls. It was not that the building had grown smaller; but, that I had grown larger. Parents! would you make villains, or blockheads of your children? There is one infallible method. Send them to a country boarding school; where, it is alike the interest of the master and the mistress, to starve and depress them; where, what profit they have, is filched out of the very food of your babes. There was one more, and only one more mortification of my boyhood, which I think it worth my while to recount. I was sent to an academy. The preceptor was an able man; and I was soon, of course, under his especial malediction. Some boys were set to speaking pieces; and one fellow, I remember, named Cobb, blacker than ten thousand devils, harangued the corporation, about “Horora now, fair darter of the dorn.” I never shall forget it. I was on fire with ambition.— I was sure that I could do it as well. It was only managing my arms like a pump handle; turning out my toes; and keeping time with the sentences. But, alas! I was barefooted. It would never do, to send me up, before the worshipful trustees of an academy, barefooted. Ah! the pang that I felt, when I saw myself alone, “all, all alone,” with naked feet, among so many shoes and stockings! My very toes, poor fellows, were cramped, I remember, with trying to hide themselves under my feet. Was that judicious in my parents? No. It was sitting me up, a proud boy, to all my school-fellows, for a butt to their ribaldry and slurring. No little bitterness did my young heart secrete, on that occasion; and no little blood did it discharge, before I was fairly at rest. Nay, so unrelenting was the persecution that I experienced, that the preceptor himself flogged me, against the established discipline of the school, because I went barefooted; not, it is true, that he knew that to be the reason—but it was the only one; for it caused a conspiracy against me, which resulted in a flogging;— and, if I had worn shoes and stockings, like the rest, he would have been afraid to flog me. On him, I have since been avenged, gloriously—most gloriously! I have met him, face to face; and he is a minister of the gospel now; and humbled him, to the very earth—with his own weapons, too!—upon his own ground! I was about to say, dunghill—but I hate indecorum toward the clergy. About this time, I had a remarkable dream. At the time, I thought little of it, after the first two or three days; and should have forgotten it entirely, but for certain events, which, after a long time, brought it fresh to my recollection, with a frightful vivacity. I am no believer in dreams. I have no regard for such as do believe in them. I have never been troubled, or alarmed, by any other, in the whole course of my life; although I have twice met with strange, startling, and unexpected confirmations of them—one of which, struck me like a flash of lightning—when I saw Emma, with my boy at her breast, once, at a window;—and I have always reasoned in this way, concerning them. Are they sent to us of God?—then are they meant for our good. But how are they ever for our good, where they are so mysterious, that they never serve as a warning; nor teach us what to avoid; nor rebuke us for what we have done; but merely trouble our senses for a little time—are forgotten—and never remembered again, till some event, to which they seem, when it has occurred, to have had some reference, has brought them anew to our recollection—with a thousand imaginary, or aggravated particulars, to alarm us; when the evil, whatever it may be, has been done. So have I reasoned. But let me tell this dream—first remarking, that it could not have been made up, and compounded of any previous ideas, or experience, in my mind; for I had no idea—had never read of—thought of—seen— nor heard of—anything thing like what I dreamed of. I dreamed that I was walking out, from a large city, on a solitary pleasant walk, by myself; that, after a K time, I came in sight of a noble looking house—almost princely in its materials—standing alone, in a bleak place—that had been enclosed by a wall—and looking, even to the old, stately trees about, as if it were abandoned of all the world; that a strange curiosity beset me, to approach it;— that I yielded, and went up to it; that I took hold of the great door, and shook it, till the dust rattled down within it, and the noise echoed through all the deserted chambers; and that I thrust open the door, and entered, without any feeling of shame or apprehension; and that I never left the house, until I had ransacked every apartment of it. It looked as if it had been suddenly left; and, probably, at night; for, in every room, I found furniture in disorder; candlesticks, or lamps, upon the table or mantle-piece, entirely burnt out. In some cases, the snuff was very long; and, in two, the wax had melted, (I had never seen a wax candle, at that time,) and run down upon the carpet. In one room, was a table with cards lying on it—all covered with dust—and glasses, with a red sediment in them. At the landing of one of the stairs, too, I found a lamp upset; and a dark stain upon the marble, where the oil had run out; and, in the hall, a candle, that had either been thrown down, or dropped, in great haste or terrour; for it was broken, and had burnt a small hole into the straw carpet. I examined all these things, I remember, with painful anxiety;—called—and shouted;—but no sound came back to me, except the echo of my own voice; and the flapping of large crimson curtains, rotting at the windows; and the loose canvass, that was falling out of the frames, of two or three fine old pictures, in the great hall—which were discoloured and mouldy, with the mildew of the place. At last, I thought, that I came away, chilled to the heart—very sorrowful; and wondering why the people had left the house—when, and why, it had been left so long, with all its rich furniture, to the spoiler, and the midnight robber. The dream made a strange impression upon me, at the time; not that it frightened, or disturbed me—but it had been so astonishingly like reality; and so little like a dream; for, in all my other dreams, even the most vivid and frightful, there has been a resemblance to something I had seen, or talked of, or thought of, before—and great incoherency; but here, there was nothing at all of it. It was all, for a week after, like the recollection of something that had really happened to me; and, I verily believe, that, if I had ever lived near a large city, at the time, I should not have been satisfied, till I had explored all the couhtry about; nay, as it was, I would start, sometimes, and feel troubled for a moment, in trying to separate parts of that dream, from parts of my actual experience. However, it passed over, and was forgotten; and never would have been remembered, I dare say, but for what happened many a day afterward.</field>

Man is, naturally, so like a beast of prey, in his appetite and disposition, that nothing is wanted to develop all the worst faculties of cowardice and cruelty, but a little too much severity in training him—a little more uninterrupted negligence—or a little more cruelty. I was born a coward. All men are born so. By this I mean, that I would shun danger, if I could; and submit to insult privately—nay, publickly, till it became insupportable, on account of its publicity. Then, like other men, I made battle; or, rather, like other boys; for I was the merest child, when the unrebuked, unrebukable spirit first arose, like a giant, within me; and struck down all the base and pusillanimous feeling of my heart, for a time. Go with me. It will do you good. I was born a coward; but I did not like to have it known. Therefore, I affected to be quarrelsome; taking care, however, not to quarrel with them that I was afraid of. Nor would I always choose the weaker or the smaller; for there was that in the eyes of many a smaller boy, which prevented me from striking him, while I could read impunity and invitation, in the eyes of many a larger one, than myself. With the latter, therefore, I quarrelled. Them, I bullied; but never did I meddle with the former, but twice—and once, I got soundly flogged for it; and the second time, I narrowly escaped. But I was never beaten—never, in all my life—by a larger boy, or a larger man. I know not why; but, to this day, I had rather quarrel with a larger, than a smaller man. Perhaps, it is, because it would be no credit to me, to prevail over the latter; and no disgrace, to be conquered by the former. But, be that as it may, I took care, early, not to pick a quarrel with one, that I did not know would bear it. What is more common? A man is no sooner known for a coward, than every poltron in society, is treading upon his heels. Horsewhip a fellow; or, let it be once known, that he will take it patiently; or, has refused to fight; and he is sure to be challenged, or spurned at, on all sides. What a catastrophe may sometimes happen, if the challenge, against all probability, should be accepted! Nothing but management, or a miracle, can save them both, then; unless some such understanding could be had, as I have known. A duel was got up, once, in this way. Two young men gave each other the lie, before ladies! They met. They would meet. No apology—none!—would be given, or taken. A copper was turned. One had the first fire. The handkerchief was dropped. His pistol went off—(perhaps under an agreement not to hit—an agreement, by the way, which is generally superfluous among green horns, where the disposition is ever so good)—the other was discharged in the air, as a matter of course. The seconds interfered. The thing was made up. The parties rode home in the same carriage, together. People talked; but what o' that? It is no such wonderful thing, that one ball should miss; and how was it possible to fire a second, when your adversary let off his pistol in the air? The plan threatened to become fashionable. The only difficulty was, that the joke was sometimes carried too far. More than one couple have fired at each other, since, for a whole afternoon, without hitting. That is quite too bad. A few anecdotes will suffice, to show the growth of a braver spirit; by braver, I mean a more long-sighted and calculating one—not a more fearless one. For, when I have stood, and measured rapiers with my antagonist—nay, when on one occasion, I drove a rough sword through and through him—till the hilt struck his breast—I was literally delirious with terrour; but, then, he had struck me—and I should have K 2 gone mad, for ever, if I had not slain him. Yes, it was fear—a base and dastardly fear—that—no matter. I pray God to forgive me. But, I feel no assurance of his forgiveness—terrible as was the provocation—sudden as was the retribution. I am not at rest, here.— No—nor ever shall be, if these convulsive shudderings are to be relied on, as the true indicia of guilt. But, to my story. There was a small boy, the terrour of the whole school, who had gone on with his imposition and tyranny over me, till I could bear it no longer. I struck him. I was pale as death, the boys told me, when I did it—and I shook all over, I remember well. We fought in a hot day, nearly all the afternoon. I was covered with blood—from head to foot; but it was all his blood—not my own; and when I had gone to bed, I wondered to find myself alive. I was not even hurt. I began to feel my own strength from that moment; to remember my forbearance and collectedness. Thrice had I desisted from the battle, in pity and compassion; yet, thrice had the desperate boy renewed it, till it was too much for human patience; and I left him, covered with sweat, and dust, and gore; and lying in the publick highway. Yet, I was never rightly satisfied with myself. He was too much smaller than I—two or three years older, to be sure—but that was no comfort to me. The next day, his brother met me—and he beat me cruelly, as he thought, till I bawled out. He was much larger than I—twice my size, and half as old again. Yet, I was not satisfied. I had suffered myself to cry; and I was ashamed of it. My head throbbed out loud for an opportunity of revenge—for another trial. It came—years and years afterward. We met, by chance. He was a man grown. We were at a bowling alley; we played together; drank together; and were about coming away together. He had forgotten the old affair; but I had not. I knew little of arms, then; and, had I known more, I should have scorned to use them. It would not have satisfied the craving of my spirit. I had bellowed, lustily, when I had been beaten; and I knew that I could not sleep quietly in my grave, unless I retaliated—unless I heard him bellowing; or, sobbing at least,—man as he was. I took him on one side; far. very far, from all human help. I turned upon him. “Prepare yourself,” said I, through my set teeth—“the boat is waiting; and only one of us will go in it.” I threw off my coat and cravat, as I said this; and he saw, by my looks, I imagine, that it was no time for parleying. To it, we went, on the dry, hard beach, under the great vaulted rocks—in a solitude so profound, that our breathing and panting could be heard a rod. He fought me handsomely; but I left him upon the ground. I was satisfied. I had heard him gasp for breath; and cry out, with his mouth bloody—in a strangling cry—for mercy, and for assistance. It was nearly a twelvemonth, before that man recovered: nay, it may be—for he is since dead—that—but no; I will not trouble myself, any more, with so foolish a thought. There is weight enough upon me now—men will spit blood. Not long after this—I speak of the time when I was a boy—I was struck by a paltry little fellow, whom I had been lording it over, with impunity, for months. A man was looking on; and I did not even return the blow. To this hour, I have not forgiven myself; or accounted to myself, satisfactorily, for it. If we meet —and meet, we shall—though our situations in life are entirely different—I shall return that blow. I care not for the consequences. There is an unquiet thought, just here, that eats, and eats—and will never lie down, till I am quit with that man. I dare not forgive him. I have not confidence enough in my own courage, to do it. If I did forgive him, I know that it would be— not magnanimity—no!—but cowardice. How strangely compounded are we. I could have crushed that boy. Yet, so thunderstruck was I, at the suddenness, and unexpectedness of his rebellion, that I had'nt the power to lift my arm. Yet, had a man struck me, at the same time, in the same place, I should have returned it, or died. Nor was that the only time. On three other occasions of my life, have I received a blow, without returning it. By heaven! it were better for them that gave it, each time, that I had let out their blood upon the spot! This it is, that makes me quake with a mortal coldness, at the mention of such an indignity; this it is, that hath made my sleep a trial to me, for years; covered my stately forehead with sweat, even in the arms of my wife—this!—and many years have happened, very many—and I was a mere boy, when it happened—yet I shall never sleep soundly, until I have returned blow for blow, upon the whole three, or upon their posterity. They were given me by cowards, like myself, it is true; but no matter for that. They ought to have been returned; if not with the hand, at least, with a knife. How could I look my boy in the face, else? How often have I told him, when I was a practical father—how often?—never to take a blow?—never!—and that, if he did, though it were from a giant, without returning it, I would renounce him—cut him off ---abandon him---for ever and ever! And so I would. I have endeavoured to make him feel that abhorrence of a coward, which children feel, instinctly, for loathsome reptiles---obscene and detestable creatures! How then, can I bear to---God!---do I ask this now?---now, when my child is in his grave? No, no. How could I bear it, I mean? He was a brave little fellow. I could have made anything of him. I once put him upon a high place; and went away off, to a great distance, and bade him jump into my arms. He was afraid. He trembled.--- He even began to cry---braced himself against the wall, with all his might; and squalled, like a little devil. I tried him again. There was no amendment. You are a coward, said I, in putting him down. He had never heard the word before. He knew not what the word meant. As a word, it gave him no trouble. He affected to disregard it. He tried, by ten thousand playful, innocent, endearing tricks, to make me forget my seriousness; but all in vain; for I knew what it was to be a coward---to have your heart full of cowardly blood. I knew that it would lead to cruelty, deceit, and death. Yea, it was all in vain. That was my first lesson; and I meant that it should be effectual. Ah! how anxious I felt. I cannot describe it. It is impossible. None but a parent can understand me. Before I was a father, I thought that I had a full conception of a father's feeling. I thought of mine own, toward my parents. Gracious heaven! how little we can judge by such a method! No child ever loved a parent, as the parent loved him. It cannot be. We attach ourselves more tenderly to them, that are helpless and dependant upon us, than they do to us. Our children forget us; wander away from us; contract new alliances; and leave us, even in our desolation, alone, and away from all help, in our piteous old age; with no companion but our infirmities, and our recollection of their unkindness.--- Nay, a man that has gone through fire and water to save another, will love him, more than he will be loved in return. Why is this? Is it to encourage man to acts of benevolence, heroism, and benignity? It is.--- There is something very delightful in conferring a favour; and it should be more delightful than receiving one; or, else, we should always be looking, not to give, but to receive. Yea, it is wisely and beneficently ordained. And so too, with parents and children. Where should it stop, the current of affection? How would it ever reach the children, plenteously, if it ran upward to the fountain; if it were not sparingly let out; or, altogether detained, in the reservoir of the child's heart, until he became a parent? We can only love with all our heart and soul. At first, we so love our parents; then, our companion for life, appears to divide that love; next, our only child comes in for a part; and so, our love continues to apportion itself to the demand, like wealth. It is the real opulence of the heart, indeed; and the portion of each that we love, must be diminished, as the number increases. Is it not wise, then, that the heart of a child should cease to yearn so tenderly toward a parent, when it hath children of its own? It is; for the helpless, troublesome, sweet creatures, have need of all a parent's heart; a continual ecstacy of tenderness, to be kept alive, for a single year. Another essay! by heaven! Forgive me, reader---I did'nt intend it. Let me return to my child. I had called him a coward, and he had gone to his play, with an air, that made my wife laugh at me and my theory, in spite of her veneration for both. After a while, he came to me—put his little arms about my neck—but, I refused to return his caress—and put him down, coldly, repeating the words “you are a coward.” He went the more vehemently to his play—but I observed, thank God for it!—while I sat reading, that he would, now and then, stop short, in the mischief that employed him; drop whatever he had in his hand, at the time—and sit motionless, for a while, as if something troubled him. O, I could have knelt down upon the spot; and thanked my Maker, in an agony of gratitude—that all my dreaming, and all my theories, were about to be realized. He came to me again. He was more serious. I persisted, however, in spite of his mother's beautiful eyes; and put him from me; but, he went no more to his play. No.—I sat and watched him, without letting him see me. I observed every movement of his face; forgive me, if I dwell a little, on the character of that boy—are you a parent?—you cannot complain. Are you not? —wait till you are; and you will then say, with the tears in your eyes, that you could listen for ever, to a parent, when his own child was the theme. I had business the next morning, that took me away, into the country, for a whole week. The moment that I alighted at the gate—Leister (for that was the name of my boy,) ran to me, and put both of his hands eagerly into mine. I saw that he wanted to say something—and I waited for him to speak.—“I'll jump, father”—said he, firmly. The tears were in his eyes. I could have hugged the little rascal to my heart; —but, I dared not—indeed, I dared not, till the whole trial should be over. It might be hazarding little— but it was my duty to hazard nothing. I led him to the same place. I went further off, than before. I saw his knees tremble. I saw his little face change colour.— To him, it was terrible; to me, nothing; for I knew that I could catch him. He prepared himself—he held his breath—he shut his eyes—and leaped! I caught him —and kissed him—I sobbed aloud—for my heart ran over. “Now, father,” said he, as soon as he could get his breath, “now, father, be I a toward?”—He could not even pronounce the word; but, he never forgot it;— and, on his death bed, it would have given him convulsions; it would have strangled him, to have called him coward. Let me return.—Three times had I been struck, before I resolved never to be struck again, without returning it; once, by a fellow, who came up, deliberately, in front of me, (I was a little chap, and alone; and he was backed by a score of boys, beside being much larger than I)—and gave me the blow in my face and eyes. I had nearly met him, once afterward—and on a desolate island. He had a narrow escape. May it happen again! Though we should both be shipwrecked upon it—the island would never be desolate again, if a dead man, or a spirit, could prevent it. The next was a similar case. I was in the country, dressed a little better than my companions; and about as haughty and insolent a little jackanapes, I dare say, as ever lived. A great bully was put up to quarrelling with me. He succeeded—struck me—and I left him in peace. Yes—I cannot deny it. Ah, heaven! what would I have given then, for the brave, desperate heart, of some boys that I have known. There was another case—another, that I had forgotten—but yet, he is dead. He was a man grown, too— and I a child. I have never forgiven him, yet; but I think it probable that I shall, when next we meet—if I am permitted first to get a blow at him. We were in different sleighs—and he ran me down, at the rate of about sixteen knots. Stay—I remember another;—it was a base, cowardly affair. It was dark; and I was pursued by a mob of boys—some one of whom, gave me a blow upon my back —as I had turned at last, to go away, thinking it all over. On him, if he be the right one, I have been avenged. We have stood upon the deck of a vessel together —and I have branded him there, leisurely, in a loud voice, for a coward, before them that knew him and me. He submitted, patiently; and well, I am sure, was it for him, that he did; for, if we had once crossed our hangers, I would have fed the sharks with him, from where I stood, for, afraid of myself—I have learnt every system of defence—and can wield any weapon, like a master. These things lie, like hot lead upon my heart. I cannot forget them. I would not; and, although, on more occasions than one, I have behaved like a man, since; where the peril was ten thousand times greater; yet, I am not, and never shall be, reconciled to the unutterable dishonour, that an unreturned blow—given before I was ten years of age too, has left upon my memory. Incidents, such as these, trivial as they may appear, are sufficient to establish the character of any man. I feel them within me, like the symptoms of insurrection,—within a beleagued province. I would be able to look my children in the face, hereafter, when I am inculcating my greatest lesson; and hear them say, without flinching, “father, did you never receive a blow—never! without returning it?” Sir---I would give my right hand---this! with which I now hold my pen, to be able to answer NO.—NEVER! Since these early days of my humiliation, I have learnt every species of defence; with the sword and without it---and may venture to say, I think, without hazard, that there are few men capable of standing before me, with, or without a weapon, for ten minutes. And what is the consequence? Am I more quarrelsome? No, indeed. I can endure many things, now; and forgive many things, now, that I would have died to avenge, a few years ago. And why is this? It is because I feel a confidence in myself. I know, now, that it is not fear which influences me, when I avoid a quarrel; and, what is better, other people know it too.— There was a time, when I could not forgive; when I could not be magnanimous; for, although I was very strong and stately, to appearance; yet, I had no confidence at all, in my own courage. The strong and brave are always less petulant and waspish, than the weak and cowardly; and the skilful, are emphatically the strong. It is difficult for any man to avoid a quarrel, when he knows that the world will attribute it to fear---nor, is there any virtue in such forbearance. Yet —how much more difficult it is to avoid one, where he, himself, is doubtful of his own motive; or, where he knows that it is fear. Have you never endured some insult, which made your blood tingle, and your ears ring afterward, when you thought of it? You have.— And what did you determine on? Was it not, to--- never endure another? I have now come to a part of my life, that gives me pleasure. I rise. I walk the room. I strive to subdue the brave, high tumult of my arteries. I cannot. What inexplicable sympathy is this? Why does my forehead redden? Why are the big veins upon my hand swollen? My teeth set? My breathing, short and violent? A thought; a single thought, hath done it. Years have rolled over me. I am at peace with all the world, unhappy and alone; willing to forgive, and be forgiven; yet, at the mere thought, of two or three events, that have happened to me, many a year ago,--all the channels of life are distended; and the blood is racing and ringing through them, just as it did, when I struck the first blow, that I ever gave, coolly and deliberately; and, by the God that made me! I felt like the young leopard, after his first battle. It is strange! wouderful! but so vivid, so burning and distinct are all these tingling emotions now, that, I can hardly persuade myself, that they are not the substantial evidences of recent insult and wrath---deadly and triumphant wrath. I had been wronged by a school-fellow; deliberately, cruelly wronged. He was very formidable to me; and the terrour of the whole school. I was in bed; and I lay and thought of the consequences; and at last, I came to the conclusion, that it was better to be whipped once, L handsomely, by him, than to submit to such continual goading. At least, I could give him some trouble, I was sure; and that might make him more heedful, for the future. But, when should it be? It was no very pleasant subject of reflection; for, I was pretty sure, whatever should be the result, of being flogged by my master, at school; and by my uncle, at home;—but, my resolution was taken. I met him; struck him; and we were torn asunder, with the greatest difficulty. I was amazed at myself. I was unhurt, again. I had not felt a blow. It is a remarkable fact, however, that in all my battles, I was never injured, in any degree, but once. From that time, I was avoided by all the boys of an overbearing temper; and loved by the quiet and feeble. I was proud of it. A sense of justice sprang up in my heart. I stood out as their champion; and, from that hour to this, coward as I am!—have I never pulled down my colours! I even became magnanimous. I felt my strength— had more confidence in myself; a high reputation; and I was unwilling to hazard it. In time, I should have become a good natured boy; but, it was my fate to be sent away, where a new reputation was to be gained by new trials and new conflicts. But, I had already, had many a scuffle; and three or four tough encountery that I have not mentioned. But, all would'nt do.—I had got above my old school fellows; and they were willing to humble me. For this purpose, they associated together, with two or three bullies, and hunted me, if I ventured out, of an evening —from pillar to post; but, will it be believed, strong as they were, and exasperated to madness, as they really were—they never could find one of their number, with sufficient hardihood to front me. Nay, from that time to this, I have never seen that living creature, who dared to strike me, or who could strike me—if he had time to see my face. Stout men have trembled before it—men, that have held at the time, a levelled pistol at my heart. I learnt the use of one look, among these boys—one, which I never used, but in mortal extremity; and never used in vain! No one could believe in its power—for, it has been a matter of life and death to me. Once, have I seen the instrument of death, drop from the hand of my deadliest foe, when he met it. It is the simple truth, I assure you, that I tell. I am telling no story, for the amusement of women and children —it is only a straight forward tale, of what has actually happened, to a living man—to myself; and, I have no motive in telling it, but the hope of being useful; not only to men, but to women and children—out of whom, men are made; and of whom, we take less care, than of our young colts, and brood mares, to prevent any dilution of the blood. I learnt, early in these encounters, that, whatever is unusual, is intimidating. I saw that others, when they were afraid, were sneaking and patient; or noisy and loud. I took another course. I stood naturally before them—calm—haughty—scornful—but, silent as death. They knew not what to expect. Perhaps they were afraid of a weapon—for, I believe that it would disturb me—and awe me, or any other man, down to the earth—to see a creature standing unmoved as I have been—with fire and death at his very heart. I should tremble to look on. I should be inclined to think that he had some resource, in steel or ball—some defence —and that his assailant was in greater peril than he. That manner has been common to me since; and will be, until I stand where they that know me, can see my heart dissolving with fear, while my countenance will remain immovable. At another time—I was yet a boy—I happened to be on a visit in the country, to a grand-father. In the neighbourhood, was a rude, quarrelsome fellow; fearless, overbearing, and cruel. He encountered me, one day, when I was with a cousin of mine; affronted me; and dared me up the hill, where he was. I accepted the challenge, instantly, notwithstanding all the remonstrances of my cousin; for, I felt that a severe whipping would be more tolerable to me, than my own feeling, if I should go to bed that night, without having upheld myself in my own opinion. The boy was alarmingly insolent; and much larger than I. But, as I approached, he retreated, and went on higher ground; repeating his challenge, all the way. It was now my turn. I saw that he was now afraid of me. My readiness had disconcerted him. I was a stranger; and, being so much smaller than he, what could give me such confidence? Something, he was sure, that I knew, and had experienced the efficacy of; some strange superiority, that was a secret to him. It was then my turn to crow; but, I had more discretion than boys in general, I neither hallooed, nor bawled; I merely told him, with a firm voice, and a steady countenance, what to me, was the bitterest word in all our language— that he was a coward; and left him. This event raised me, abundantly, in the estimation of my cousin. It was a good lesson to him; and no unprofitable one to me. Our worst pain is that of of terrour. the reality is never so cruel, as are our anticipations. Lo! how I reason—and yet, here I am; afraid of death—even now, as no woman was ever afraid of it—in spite of all that I can say, or do!—Well —my confidence in myself, grew greater and greater, every day. I wrestled; and ran; and leaped; and found no competitors. Why, then, should I be quarrelsome? Why had I been so? Merely, because, in my heart, I felt that I was a coward; merely, because I was afraid to be meek and forgiving; for, many and many a time, had I sought a quarrel, solely because I was in doubt, whether, if I refrained, it would be from gentleness, magnanimity, or cowardice. That it should be from the latter, was often so terrible to me, that I have provoked, wantonly and deliberately, a feud with some other boy, merely because he was generally formidable. How often will this happen, in society! Some ruffian, of established reputation, for the murders that he hath committed, with sword or pistol, puts upon you, either from carelessness or accident, an equivocal affront; what can you do? You, who are unknown, untried?—You must fight him. There is nothing else left to you. You can never take an apology; and still less, offer one, to such a man. The world would say that you were afraid, if you did; no matter, whether you were right or wrong—and the world would undoubtedly be right. Coward!—go to your own room—kneel down by your bed side!—place your locked hands upon the Bible; and pray to God, for a little steadiness. Do that —and you are panoplied in steel. No blade can touch you. No ball can reach you. You bear a charmed life. Let your deportment be that of a man—serene— unchangeable; and the time will soon come, coward, that you are, when a man would sooner thrust his right arm, up to the shoulder in molten iron, than raise it against you. If you be assailed, defend yourself. Leave the agressor, if it must be so, dead at your feet—as a warning to others; and a rebuke to the law—which, I must say, is no protection, under dishonour; but do not fight him, because you have no reputation in blood. Do not fight him, because you are a coward; or, because he is not a coward—or because you dare not refuse to fight him. Not long after this, I was put to a yet more severe trial. The same deportment carried me through it, unharmed. I had been threatened by a boy, who was the terrour of the town. I was told of it, by another, just when the former was in sight. I went, immediately, over the street, to the place where he stood, and bought some apples. His heart failed him. He never opened his mouth. But, had I shown any symptom of fear, I had been broken down upon the spot. These were but experiments; but they were constantly recurring; and went a great way, toward making me familiar with men. I carried them too far sometimes; and, on one occasion, I baited a brutal fellow, of more than twice my size, till he maddened in thinking of it, and waylaid me, with a troop of boys, when I was coming out of the water, cold and averse---more so, than I ever recollect in my life, before, to a squabble. He had given out that he meant to make an example of me; that he would compel me to kneel down, and ask his pardon. I but spoke a few words---nay, I believe that I did say, that I begged his pardon; but I did it with a L 2 laugh, and standing; and he was glad enough to take it in any way, to find an excuse for backing out. I could see that; and so the matter ended. But I had now become a boy of some notoriety. I was no longer quarrelsome—that is. I never sought a quarrel; but it was pretty well understood that I was quick as lightning in my temper; and never avoided a quarrel, when it came in my way. In all towns, there are apt to be local jealousies, conspiracies, and associations. There were some in mine. They were distinguished by the name of upper-enders, lower-enders, and middle-enders. Leaders were chosen, and some bloody affairs took place. I was rather on neutral ground—and, as neutrals generally are, spoiled and buffetted by both parties--by both belligerants, I could say. I could bear it no longer. I collected a number of boys, one evening, to scour the streets---and give battle to anybody and everybody, who should not answer to our satisfaction, when the countersign was called for. I was a sort of chief, as if by common assent—with a little usurpation. We had not gone far, when, lo! the Philistines were upon us! I had some laughable notions of chivalry; and, full of stories, that I had recently read, I agreed to meet the Goliah of the opposite host, in single combat. We met; and it was there, that I was very severely hurt, for the only time in my life, on such an occasion; but I beat my antagonist, till he bawled out for “a pole! a pole!” swearing that he would only fight me across a pole. While we were arranging matters; and I was beginning to recoverfrom a confounded knock under my right ear, that he had given me, we were separated. We met, afterward; and I felt no little secret satisfaction, when I found out who he was—and what; and that he had no disposition to renew the battle. He carried twice my weight of metal; but he was, literally, beaten black and blue, before he had time to get his breath. Every day, I could perceive that the boys treated me with more respect: and, although I was bitterly scolded at home and abroad, by my father, and my master; and even—by Elizabeth herself—and by Hammond, the dwarf—of whom, more by and by—nothing could avail to make me leave off the practice of defending myself—as it is known to be lawful, to do, in an enemy's country, by offending others. Still there were two or threee persons, of whom I had a constitutional dread; among them was a smart, spirited fellow, with whom I had fought, when quite a child, at least one hundred times; and, always, without gaining an inch. There were few, that dared to touch him. For years, he had not quarrelled with anybody. His reputation was a shield to him. He grew arrogant— insupportably so. Everybody observed it; but nobody dared to undertake his chastisement. We were on the best terms—very intimate; and perpetually together. Our masters had both failed in business, about the same time; and we were thrown out of employment. Every afternoon, we were together, pitching coppers; drawing lots; or cutting cards; or playing nine pins for porter or cider;—we were about sixteen or seventeen, I should suppose—he, about a year the older. I had put up with a good deal from him, before that day—for it had never entered my head to dispute, seriously, with him, for dominion; but the time had now come. I happened to have a new coat—how, heaven knows! whether by theft, charity, contribution, or how. It was very beautiful, although second handed—and the whole town knew of it; the first too, that I had ever worn, with bright buttons. I was not a little proud of it; and he was not a little envious. I am sure. We had some scuffling together, and I knocked off his hat. He attempted, again and again, to retaliate; and, at last, tore the lappet of my coat. I grew serious immediately; and told him not to persevere; but he did not heed me. He had often seen me as serious, before, but never so determined. “If you make the attempt again, Jim,” said I, “I shall strike you.” I said it—but I did not mean it. I was not brave enough for that. “Will you,” said he; and, immediately after, he made the attempt; and received a blow from me, that sent him, staggering, against the wall. It was some minutes before he fully recovered; I was perfectly astonished at myself; and he seemed like one doubtful of his own senses— what!—to be struck by me:—it was incredible. He approached me, soon after—just as if nothing had happened—and, before I was aware of it, struck me, two or three light, swift blows, in quick succession. They did not hurt me—they only jarred my blood a little; but they were spitefully given. At the same time, he added—“Go down with me, behind that building, (pointing to a large warehouse, on the wharf, below,) and I will flog you.” “With all my heart!” said I—and rose to follow him. “A fight! a fight!” shouted the boys. I followed him; but, when we had arrived there, he seemed to think it too publick a place; and, as it was then quite too late for trifting, we agreed to walk on together, toward the Backfields, until the boys were weary of following us; or, to turn upon them, together, and beat them back; but our countenances were sufficient, when we faced them. They looked at us; and had not the hardihood to track us, a single step further. We soon found a spot fitted for the battle. It was nearly a mile from the place, where our wrath had been kindled. We had walked along, side by side, in silence, the memory of our ancient friendship, tugging at our hearts—as yet, unwilling to be dislodged. It was a memorable spot to me. Near it, I had been nearly skinned alive once, by one of my dear uncles;—the church was nigh at hand—and a burying ground too, for ought that I knew. It was a hot day; and, lest people might see us, we descended into a clay pit—and stripped. I gave the first blow; it was a timid one— and we fought till both were entirely exhausted. We renewed the battle. I pressed upon him, till he fell; and then saw I, that he was afraid of me—yes, afraid! for he lay upon his back, and kicked at me, with his feet, as if it had been possible for me to strike him, while he was down. I waited till he was up. He next gave me a bloody nose; and he waited, in his turn for me—till I had gone down to the water, and washed my face, and returned to the field. Soon after that, I gave him a black eye; or rather, a blow, which, he thought, would produce one; but it did not, and I waited till he could see, before I struck him again. Thus we fought— till we could scarcely draw breath. We stood and panted, before each other, with our mouths open, and bloody; and without the power to strike a blow, like two wild beasts, that have wrestled their hearts away. My object was achieved. I had conquered—not that I had whipped him; for that I did not pretend to do—that was not what I had gone down for—but I had conquered my own fear of him; and given him an opportunity to whip me, as he had threatened; and he had been unable to do it. Therefore, had I conquered; for I had defeated him in his design. We returned together; and, the last words, that he said to me, when we parted, were, a threat to strike me again, the first time that we should meet. “If you please,” said I, coldly, “I shall give you an opportunity, to night.” I did, as I promised—I gave him the opportunity; but he never availed himself of it. He dared not. We became fast friends; and are so, to this hour; and I would not cower with him at my side, against any two men that might happen to meet us, in this world—although now, I could beat the breath out of his body in ten minutes—and whip half a dozen more, just like him, one after the other—in consequence of my skill and science. Not long after this, I was in a strange place, alone, but very confident of my power. I was grossly insulted. I was too far from the man to knock him down; and I was afraid that my wrath would get cool, if I did not punish him upon the spot. He was then surrounded by three others, two of whom were his brothers. More than an hour had passed, ere I had the opportunity that I wished. He slept in the next room to me—at a tavern. I heard him go in—I knew his voice; and my bed shook under his tread. I waited till all was still as death in the house. I trembled. My heart collapsed. I had pistols, and a dirk—I took them out of my trunk, loaded them—but God stayed my hand. And yet, I could not forgive the insult. I went to bed; and there lay, the sweat distilling out of my very bones and heart, it did appear to me. A deep sleep fell upon me, a troubled dream. I could endure it no longer. I arose. There was a cold moonlight abroad—the streets were terribly still; and the long yard; and distant garden, back of the house, full of old trees—were silent, like a subterranean wood, tenanted only by apparitions. Perhaps, my own thought frightened me; but, I do declare that, never, never before, nor since, have I felt such a supernatural awe upon my spirit, as I did that night, while I was endeavoring to recal my dream, and the circumstances of the evening. It appeared to me that I was the only living creature, perhaps, upon the whole earth. How could I know that my insulter was alive? I trembled; but, when I would have put my hands into my bosom, I found that I had pistols in them—my fingers seemed to have grown to them. I could not, for some time, so rigid were the muscles, disengage them; but I succeeded at last, and the tears—hot, scalding tears, fell into the pan as I opened it, and saw all the preparation of death so complete. When had it been made? By whom? By myself, or my evil spirit—the old Tempter, while I was sleeping, or delirious—aye—and I had been in bed with them, loaded—slept with them—upon them! My blood thrilled. My dream came to me—a new horrour shook me. I dreamt that I had stabbed a man. Might it not be, if I had done so much, unconsciously, that I might have done more. Who could say that I had not consummated the crime that my heart had meditated, and my hands had begun. I tried the barrels with a shaking arm. They were loaded. But the dirk. I hurried to the table where I had left it when I went to bed. It was gone. I searched for it—and found it—gracious God!—my dream flashed upon me all at once—I now remembered that I had dreamed of using it. I grew sick and faint. I staggered to it—It was driven, up to the cross, through the back of a chair at my side. I plucked it out, in a moment of desperation—and, it was several minutes, before I could bring myself to believe that the point was not bloody—so horribly vivid and distinct had been my dream—and such unutterable terrour had I felt. I sat down—I clasped my head in my hands; and thought it all over. What had saved me? what good angel had turned the dagger against the chair, instead of a human heart— my own heart perhaps?—These were alarming thughts —but they kept me from doing vengeance; and I knelt down, and thanked the Almighty, from the bottom of my heart, that he had suffered me to be angry and sin not. I even forgave my enemy, and prayed for him. How refreshing, how ennobling are such prayers. I went to bed—I slept—I, who had not slept for years-- like an infant, upon the bosom of its own mother.— When I awoke, the whole of the past night came to me again, like a long, troubled, and distracted dream. I looked for the dagger and pistols; and it was not till then, that I was fully sensible of my escape. I discharged them from the window. We met at breakfast. the scoundrel was rude and insolent again to me. I sat near him. I would have given all that I was worth, to have been away. I bore it, till I could bear it no longer. I pushed away my cup. I leaned forward. The people saw me; and their faces changed--and they were all silent. “Sir,” said I, looking him steadily in his face, “you are a bully; a scoundrel; a liar; and a coward. That you are a bully, no man would doubt. That you are a coward, is evident, from your conduct toward two or three smaller men than yourself. That you are a liar, is perfectly self evident. That you are a scoundrel, is written in every lineament of your face.” The wretch was absolutely breathless; he was like a man thunderstruck, for a minute. All eyes were turned upon us. There was a silence, like death. He stood up; and I pushed back my chair, and stood up, and confronted him—like a man. I say, like a man— because I felt then, that it was like a man. The people looked at the table, as if they saw blood there—and just as they were when I spoke first, there staid they, as if turned to stone. I saw him preparing to raise a horse-whip over me. “Stop,” said I.—I was willing to tell him, in season, that, if he touched me with that, I would never quit my hold of his throat, at which I was preparing to leap, until his soul had left his body—but there was no time for it. He raised the whip. I sprang upon the table —it fell, with a tremendous crash—and the next moment, we were upon the floor, rolling and blaspheming together, and all covered with blood and broken glass. The next thing that I recollect, was, a blackened and swollen face, almost touching mine; a frightful sobbing; and the report of a pistol, close to my head. It must have been discharged near to me; for I was blinded, and stunned, and choked with it. The lesson was a terrible one to him—and it was three months, before I recovered from it. It appears that he drew a pistol, and fired it at me, while we were together;—and, that I had nearly strangled him, before I was torn off from him. I was not wounded, but stunned; and lay, for some time, in the blood, like a dead body. Not a year after this, I heard a cry of murder in a lonely house, when I was passing it, very late at night. I was alone, and unarmed; my blood thrilled, with terrour—my heart stopped—I called myself a coward; burst open the door—ran up stairs—found a room crowded—several women and children shrieking—two or three ruffians standing about, as if recruiting for a second battle; and a stout, damnably visaged fellow, in the middle of the room, with his knee upon the breast of an old man, whom he had overthrown—and a chair raised, as if to knock out his brains. I am very strong —very—when greatly exasperated; and a certain air of authority, on such occasions, which I have learnt to assume at discretion, may have had its effect—yet, still—there is something incredible left to be accounted for.--Before you could have numbered ten, I had wrenched the chair away—tumbled the ruffian, heels over head, down the steps; and cleared the room of every living creature, except the old man, the women and the children. I know not how it was done—they were scattered as if the lightning had been among them. Such things will give one confidence in himself; and where one has the sense of right; and hears the cry of a woman, or a child—or that of murder; it appears to me, that, if he were a dwarf, he could face a giant. Believe me, I mention these evidences of my early strength, that some things, which are sacredly true that happened at my maturity, and soon to be related, may not be considered fabulous. In desperation, men will do that, which no human force could achieve at other times. A culprit that I knew, has lately leaped over a high wall, in his chains; and beaten through a thick oaken door;—literally beaten it to pieces, with the irons upon his arms, before he could be pinioned. People will lift, and carry burthens, at a fire, which they cannot stir, after it is over. Many men cannot hold down a mad-man; who is weak, when in his senses. So was it, with me. Passion is madness with me. It is a whirlwind. My very blood-vessels are distended to rupture. No human strength can withstand me. I have pulled a tall man down to the earth with my left hand—held him there—immovably—rifled his pockets; and then dragged him to the door; and tumbled him out into the street. The next minute, I could not have done the same, to a child of twelve. I was once nearly pressed to death, by the wheel of a gig, which had run me up against a stone wall; another turn of the wheel would have torn out my bowels, with the hub. I braced myself against the wall, and sent, by one desperate exertion, horse, gig, and a lady that was in it, down from a high bank, into the road. Evening.—Half past nine. Is there any thing in this world so delightful as to escape from company—tiresome and civil beyond expression—people that you have been owing a visit to for months and months, and putting off the evil day of payment, till it could be put off no longer—to see whom, you have gone, at last, just in season to get an invitation for their next party—is there any thing in this world so delightful, as to escape from them, at last— M though you really love them—and dodge into your cold study, where, on looking at your watch, you find just three hours left to you, of a winter night for meditation— alone—altogether alone.—You rake open the red ashes; pile on the green wood; and, ere your lamp is lighted, find the beautiful blaze breaking upward, through all the tangled interstices, of the small wood, before you could believe it possible; and then you turn, and listen to the pealing and crackling of the bark; and see the coloured flame, working its way, hither and thither, among the wickerwork, like some strangely bright animal, imprisoned in a natural bower. O, how cheering is the blaze of such a fire—as this!—as this!—when you are all living alone! Who would ever get married? ---I was going to say, but that were too profane—in a widower; who would ever hang himself,—or his head, if he might sit alone, when the rest of the world were all asleep; and feel such gentle companionship as I do, in that fire. Ah—a spark—another! by heaven, this hickory wood is bad stuff, for a fellow that finds his own carpet—and such a carpet! No, no—it is better to be married, if it be only to have something to take care of the fire. I never could endure a close stove—one of these cursed cast-iron comforts of life—mere substitutes for comfort; so cold, unsocial, and dark.—I would as soon sit by a cast iron countenance, all the winter through—or go to bed to a—.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. There seems to be a great deal of meaning in a late practice—introduced, I believe, by Lord Byron—of leaving blanks in the story. Some further improvements may yet be made; and there are poets who, if they should make their blanks a little more frequent than they do, would act yet more wisely. I mention the thing with uncommon diffidence;—they might make them more frequently, and of a greater length. The more the better. If there be significance in one blank, surely there must be more in a hundred. So, the fools reason—forgetting that one simple word, in a sentence, pronounced emphatically, may thrill like electricity; when you would fall asleep in the noisy monotony of sound, if many were made emphatick. Might not the practice be introduced, with effect, into novels? I think it might; and if the chapter, immediately preceding the blanks, be made to end adroitly, a busy imagination is all a tilt at once—ten thousand pleasant, or wicked meanings, are imagined, until the conclusion is come upon—like a coiled rattle-snake— that somewhat was there, quite too shocking for the publick eye, where the blank now is—which the printer—excellent man—struck out; leaving the blank as a guide post, to the inquisitive, for whatever scene of horrour or profligacy of thought the reader may choose. Let this chapter be a blank, then; and, if the reader blush, she will have nobody to blame but herself. What have I said? Nothing. I have only stopped—thrown down my eyes—and minced my words, a little—as modest ladies do—when— I cannot afford to waste any more paper—though, like that consecrated by poets, it be covered with—or cut up into—stars—for fly traps, hair papers, or constellations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. Treachery....Sentence begun—never ended....Modesty....Men and Women...Ribaldry...Advice....Apostrophe...Reflections on Women. It is now my intention to pass rapidly over a series of little adventures, that happened to me, in my boyhood, in a somewhat regular manner; after which, I shall proceed with my story, just as my humour urges me, regardless of aught but my own amusement. And here, let me begin with an affair, that occurred to me while I was quite a boy. I have never forgotten it:— hardly, for a moment, has it been absent from my thought, I ought to say, from the day that it happened; and then, I was quite a child. I tell it now, lest I may forget it; although I hardly know how to introduce it. But, why make any apology? Is'nt the book full of such episodes? Enough for me, that this one had some influence on my whole future life. While I was a mere child, though I do not recollect my age, I remember that there was a wedding at one of the neighbours. I lay and thought a good deal about it, the night before, without well understanding what was meant by it. I grew uneasy. My insatiable curiosity—that devil—was at work again. I determined to conceal myself in the bride's chamber. I did—and you will smile, when I relate what I saw, before I was discovered. The poor girl, a remarkably timid, delicate, modest, gentle, innocent creature, came up stairs, attended by two romping bride maids, who attempted to pull off her clothes, and put her to bed, by main force. She resisted—and they, finally, consented that she should undress herself. So, she began;—first, she pulled off one glove—then, fetched a deep sigh—then, rolled it up—(the glove, I mean—not the sigh)—then, pulled off the other—then sighed again, from the very bottom of her heart—and began to roll them both up together. The girls became impatient, and snatched the gloves away. Then the bride took off the ribband that bound her waist—and began rolling that up slowly, as if she never would be done—inch by inch, and with all her might—breathing a faint sigh, at every turn. “Pho, pho! give me the ribband,” said one—“what a fuss you make about it.” “Lord!” cried the other, “I would'nt mind it, at all.” “O, yes you would,” answered the poor bride—seeking, by every artifice in her power, to prolong the ceremony; for the groom was getting impatient—and I could see him pacing to and fro, in the hall below, taking out his watch at every turn—and shaking the whole house with his tread. Then the poor bride began to pull off one of her stockings—and then—and then—I came away. And now, to the main story. Among many hundred scrapes, some of which were truly laughable, quite too laughable for relation, except the company be all men, or all women; all married, or all single; and nearly of the same age, too—Stop! that puts me in mind of a matter, upon which I will step aside for a moment.— Women! hearken to me. I know something of that evil propensity, which is common among you, when you are once—for a single moment—admitted to an acquaintance with certain mysteries. Widows and wives! Women of beauty and excellence!—how many of you, are there, who, if ye happen to be very intimate with each other, and sitting together in a tight room, by yourselves, would be willing to have a man overhear your conversation? Ah! you are startled. I have been among you, on many occasions, when you knew it not; by your side, when you saw me not; at times, when the thickness only of a thin board, kept us apart at night;—nay, less than that, sometimes. I have heard your murmuring in your sleep; your half articulated thought; your deep, deep inaudible soliloquy:—God! how you would have shivered at the near sound of a man's voice! I have overheard you in couples; been with you, on sacred occasions; heard the young, blushing, and innocent creature, who, were I to judge from the blue tenderness of her eyes; the bashful sweetness of her untasted lip; would fall down with affright, and M 2 hide her burning forehead, and gushing eyes—as if she had been caught naked, by a ruffian—if one impure thought; or one immodest allusion, had been uttered in her presence;—lovely and timid creatures, whom it would seem impossible that indelicacy could approach; —spiritual ones, who could not—so your heart would delight to think—who could not understand the look or language of impurity—looking as if butter wouldn't melt in their mouths. Yes. I have been with them; by them, at their most secret moments: and heard them—alone— in couples—in their bed-chambers —at church—in the wood —and the water—utter such things!—woman!— such things that my very heart hath turned pale at them. Yea, and mothers; wives; and the newly married —the holy and consecrate—have I not heard from their lips, what, had their husbands heard from them—their lovers—or their children—O, what had been their alarm, and sorrow, and amazement. Woman! if thou art worthy of the name, thou wilt never utter that—never listen to that, which thou wouldst not be willing to say aloud, before any man living. I have known some—, some few;—they were the white waxen flowrets, that cannot even be breathed upon, by an impure heart;— transparent and beautiful blossoms, that are sullied by even the breath of unholy passion;—stars that wane and dissolve, if approached, even at midnight. profanely. They were worshipped—they! Ask your own hearts. Let me ask thee, dearest—hast thou never, never, in all thy life, uttered that to a woman, which, for thy right hand, thou wouldst not have had a man to hear? Yet, thou art pure—pure as the drifted snow —born of rain and cold—tears and chilliness—high up in the heaven. Look at me—thou of the dark, imperial eye;—thou stately creature, of the regal front, and tread of dominion—whom but to think of, brings the sweat out upon my mouth—and have I not—even I—heard thee mean that, as thy sweet, clear voice fainted in my ear; seen thee understand that, at which, when thou wast all alone, thy cheeks kindled, and thine eyes filled, at having meant or understood? Have I not? Hear me—woman! dear woman!—there is not that being beneath the sky—no, not one, that reveres you as I do. I would not see you profaned—I would not even imagine it. I would preserve you untasted—unbreathed upon—with “innocent lips,” and unpractised eyes. And, therefore, do I counsel you. No matter how your fellow-women, of more experience, may affect to countenance and encourage you, when you are shrinking, with your first love—nestling in it, like your first child, at your own bosom; or trembling, and blushing, and warming all over, as you strive, vainly strive, to adjust your shawl, so that no eye may detect the thrilling secret—of your happiness, “if you love your lord.” No matter how they may strive to win you into their way, there is a sanctity, a sweetness, a something unapproachable—like witchery and enchantment---the virginity of the blood and thought---about you now, that will be gone the first moment that you listen to, or repeat (for that will follow,) the words of meaning, that shall be uttered where you are. Do not listen to them;---do not, I entreat you. They that laugh at your prudery—even they, will love you the better for it.— To love, and be beloved, should be the religion of women. Not that “to suckle fools, and chronicle small beer,” are to be your only employments. No;—but I would have you, what heaven meant you to be—the mother and the wife; the companion, friend, and counseller of man; his home—his heaven; a something, with whom he may mingle his immortality, thought, and essence; sure that it will be purified by the communion, whether your lips are thrilling together, or oceans are rolling between you. Would you be this? Would you? Awake then; put on the imperial beauty that man loves; that, which conquers, while it lifts up the compassionate, supplicating, imploring eyes of love to us; be yourselves; be modest; rebuke the licentiousness, which is growing upon you. Let your foreheads expostulate with it. By heaven, I have a mind to speak plainly. I will! I have overheard women, modest women, say, what I have blushed, afterward, to think of; and I have no great pretensions to modesty. I have seen high-minded women; women, whom I do respect, and could have loved, betray a quickness of apprehension upon some subjects; a dexterity of application, that took my breath away; and brought the water into my eyes. I have been afraid to look them in the face again. But others—O, I have known more than one blessed creature, who never un derstood aught that she should not understand; or, if she did, they only could see it, who knew when the colour of her eyes changed, with shame and sorrow. Woman!—you know not your own character! Why do you expose your naked arms, and naked shoulders? Why do you wear flesh-coloured stockings, thin as cobweb, with lace insteps and clocks. Look at me. I put the question home to you. You “cannot tell.” “It is the fashion.” Pshaw! Why do you expose your bosoms?—particularly, when you know them to be beautiful?—or, why do the more knowing ones, cover it with a transparent gauze? Dare you acknowledge the true reason? Are you not ashamed of it? Is it to excite the envy of women? In part, it may be. Or, is it to move the passions, and excite the blood of men? —of the voluptuary, and the sensualist? You tremble at the thought. The tears come into your eyes. Yet, how can you deny it? Ye do these things—that cannot be denied. Tell me why ye do them. Is it that you do not think of the matter? Shame on you, if that defence be a true one! Can a modest woman uncover her beauty, without thinking of it?—without knowing it? As soon would she go entirely naked—not, all at once—but, gradually, and after a little time. But, perhaps, you will take that back. “I always think of it,” you may say—“but it is the fashion.” What!—is that the answer of a creature, when the nakedness of her heart has been uncovered—her most holy enchantment revealed to the wanton multitude. If fashion can so utterly overcome the natural instinct of modesty, in any woman—I care not who she may be—as to reconcile her to an exposure, that, if it were not fashionable, she would blush at—I should have no hope for her—no confidence in her—in Turkey, or Italy—or any where; if the fashion of the age were ever so shameless, or beastly. Example—Fashion, then, will make you do what you disapprove. O, woman, what more could your bitterest enemy say of you! In short, either you do approve of such things, or you do not. If you do, you are no longer a woman; for it is the character—the essential character of woman, to shrink from the exposure of her charms. If you do not approve of it, and yet yield to the fashion, you are more of a woman, to be sure, in one thing; but less, in modesty, and far less, in principle. Why, even boys are more modest—and grown men—where indecent tales are told, than you sometimes are. How mistaken we are. Humour and ribaldry—nay, even wit, when it most elates us, like the delirium of intoxication, will always leave us mortified and humbled. How often have I seen a great man lose his hold upon the veneration of other men, by coming too near them, and their infirmities, with some paltry joke. And yet, strange as it is, we do love to see the great and good forgetting, thus vilely, all their greatness and goodness. Judges of courts have I seen, gloating on obscenity and lewdness, about a table—ministers of the gospel—aged and venerable men—men of wisdom and piety—fathers and husbands—who should, if they had life in them, when a ribald joke was uttered; or a scurrilous toast; or a blackguard song; have arisen, and rebuked the ruffian to the dust. By heaven, I would as soon show an indecent print to my own daughter; or sing a bawdy song before modest women; nay, be guilty of any shameful outrage upon modesty, before my own mother, sister, or daughter, as utter an obscene sentiment or allusion, in the presence of an old man. There is an awful something to me, in the bearing of old age. I feel, when I see a broad old forehead; and a bright, venerable eye, shaded by the thin grey hair of great age, as if I am with one, that is holier than I; a greater favourite of heaven; and much nearer the time of meeting with his God;—as if I am performing before one, that is about to carry news of younger men, and of me, into the habitation of all men—the ancient heavens. How horrible it is, to hear such men uttering, with “a death-bed sensation, some blasphemous jest.” It makes me indignant, weary, angry, and impatient. I could arise, and rebuke them for it. What! I would say—are ye fathers?—husbands?—and will ye bear this? Call in your wives!—your daughters! Let them listen to, and mock at you, till their tears blind them! Oh, no, no! Men will not be taught; and old men, least of all; and, although every man knows, that he never heard another tell a smutty story; or make an immodest allusion, without feeling his respect for him diminished; yet, every man, when men are assembled together, —I never knew an exception in all my life, at a large dinner table—will say things; and listen to them, (which is the same.) and chuckle over them, too, as if there were a luxury in their wicked raciness, pollution, and pungency, which was irresistible; things, at which they should weep for shame, for having permitted them to be said in their presence, when they are alone. It is inconceivable that men will do this; but, how transcendently worse is it in women! What a horrour do we feel for the impious, the intemperate, or the bloody minded woman; yet, to our horrour and hatred for these, are added a faintness of the heart; a sick loathing for the indecent woman. And this is so instinctively man's nature, that he will turn away with abhorrence from her, in the last paroxysm of his own moral corruption. And yet, there are scoundrels—ah! how many!—who appear to delight in bringing down these poor creatures, these spiritualities, to the base earth. Nay, are there not many nobler creatures; men of high bearing; resolved minds; prompt and lofty energies; who are for ever wandering upon the very confines of the forbidden; tempting the unwary among women, by the voluptuous warmth of their manner; their hazardous prompting; their continual invitation; just to overstep, for one moment, the barrier of snow; or, if that may not be, just to let their thought wander over, or their eyes, for a moment! It is common. I blush to say it; but, heed me woman—thou, who hast no brother to tell thee this; thou, whose lover dare not, even if he imagine it possible that thou shouldst need it; whose husband will not;—do thou listen to me. Be assured that, with all our art, and all our apparent pleasure, when we see thee forget the modesty of thy nature, we do feel a pang; we do, assuredly, even at the profanation of our own hands. Hallow thyself, then. Be what thou mayest be:—a vessel into which our hearts may empty themselves—breath and blood—when hurried almost into the grave, by the misfortune, and the sorrow, and the apparitions of life. Do not believe that we love you the better, when we laugh most heartily at your wit—do not; it is a mortal errour. We may laugh; but it were a better compliment to you, if we wept, when we see your pure hands so unworthily employed; or your mind distilling poison; or your beautiful bodies anointed with impure passion. But why need I preach to you? Neither you; nor the old men; nor the wise, will heed me. You are afraid of being laughed at; as if it were not better to be laughed at, by all the world; and loved by one, to idolatry; than to be waited on with sensual, though ever so rich offerings, by all the men of the world. But it is not so. Be modest, and they dare not laugh at you. Affectation only is ridiculous. Sincerity and nature never are. Let your modesty be natural, then; unostentatious; shutting itself up, like water-lilies with the dew in them; or soft eyes, when they are first kissed. Depend upon it—we shall all cease to laugh at you, before you know it; and love and pray for you, before we know it, ourselves. And men, too—old men—why should I preach to them?—the feeble of heart? Have I not seen people get drunk; smoke, even when the sickness of their heart was like death, that they might avoid all imputation of ignorance upon a subject, of which to have a knowledge, is to be base and brutal? Have I not, again and again, set at a table, where stories, and songs, and toasts, were heard, which not a man there, would have had it known abroad, among women, that he had heard, for his right hand. It only wanted a word—one word, from some brave youthful heart; and the scoundrel face of immodesty, had been banished from the spot. But who should speak? The old dared not;---the young trembled, and were afraid. One voice only was heard; one---and it was that of the youngest in company; and what was the result? This---this! Is it not honourable to the nature of man? Is it not a proof that the Divinity will abide within us, in spite of our profanation? Did I ever know it fail? No, never. All hands have united---all hearts---and we have looked into each other's faces, after we have heard the malediction pronounced, as if wondering that it had been delayed so long; and that we had so long born a brutal profligacy and licentiousness, at the table. And I---yes, it was I;---I will not pretend to deny it;---I am not ashamed of it;—it was I!—I have gone home, a prouder and a better man, for it. That would seem like courage in me; but it was not. I shook all over, when I lifted my voice among them. Yet, think not that I would have you fastidious. No, I hate that. I know not which is most disgusting—immodesty or squeamishness; or which is least so. Are they not the same thing? The truly modest woman will speak of the duties of a wife and a mother---though she be unmarried---when the conversation naturally falls that way, as she would of religion. So much depends upon the mind, and place of the thought. We go to church, and hear---what we cannot repeat. We take up the Bible, and read aloud, to them that love us—what we could not read in any other book. The truly modest woman, in such a case, will never falter when she comes upon the bad word; the same voice, the same look, the same attitude will continue; but the immodest woman, will be sure to make such a fuss about it, that she tempts all that hear her, to get the Bible, and hunt for the place, where she was reading; and dwell upon it, at some time, when they are alone. No;---I would have a woman so modest, that her tears should fall continually, when she was alone, if aught that she could not repeat, to her husband, or lover, or son, or father, had been said in her company; yet able to sit upright in her chair; look me patiently in the face; and speak, without emotion, of many a prohibited theme. Society is advancing. There was a time, a few years only have passed, when a woman, in America, or England, would not have spoken of a pain in her breast, for all the world; all her pains, in that region, were then described by the most awkward circumlocution; as a pain in her side; a pain here; a pain there; the stomach ache; a pain near the shoulder, &amp;c. &amp;c. But how is it now? Nothing is more common, than to hear a lovely girl, with a bosom just heaving up to the wind, like something hidden and terrified, speak of a pain in her breast, just as of a pain in her head. And what is the result? A man thinks no more of it. But, if she hurt her knee, or broke her leg, or her thigh—O, there is no telling of that, before any man; and her awkward, roundabout way of describing it, has often a very mischievous effect upon his imagination. Upon my word, dear woman—you must be a woman, and a dear one, too, if you have got this far—the patience and curiosity of no man, could have sustained him;—this speculation on modesty was utterly unpremeditated. I know not how it happened; perhaps from coming home, from a house where I love to go, the mistress of which, a most fascinating and superiour woman, will understand, now and then, what she ought not; and will make a man, if he have any blood or pulse, understand it too; had disturbed me so confoundedly, that—really, I began to think of old times, when—But it is too late to begin another chapter to-night; so I will, if I can, huddle together a few more remarks on this subject—woman—and then go to bed. Why do you strip when you go into company? Do you know your own interest. You sit covered, and muffled up to the eyes, before them that truly love and respect you; and you go, with your very bosoms naked; aye, your bosoms, whereon, if a man really loved you, he would as soon another had placed his hand, or his mouth, as his eyes; aye, your bosoms—the pillow, where a husband, the lord of your heart, and the father of your babes, will yet lay his aching temples, with the thought of rapture—that he sleeps upon something holy—unvisited, N unprofaned. Woman!—woman!—how dare you so trifle with that sanctity, with which heaven hath delighted to invest you? O, could you but feel, for one moment, that delirious enjoyment, which the heart bounds to, when it is near the unvisited heart of a loved one---ah! you would shut yourselves up---veil your eyes—and shade your beauty---as some flower of Iove, which, to be truly dear, may not be blown upon, by the common wind of heaven! Look to yourselves. A plain question is before you. Why do you expose yourselves so---publickly, and to strangers? You are ashamed to answer me. I am glad of it. I respect you the more for it. There is yet something left to love in you, after all. Why are you always in advance of our opinions. Let me tell you why you dare to do this. It is the fashion. The fashion! What a plea for a modest girl, who shivers with alarm, if her lover find her with her neck uncovered, in her own room; yet, goes into a mob of leering, sensual profligates and debauchees; and stands, half naked, before their gloating and drunken eyes. O, shame! A woman that will do this, will— by heaven! what will she not do? It is either pleasant, or it is not. If it be pleasant to HER, it shows a nature, that would, on a fitting opportunity, throw her upon the town; if unpleasant, and yet she do it, in obedience to fashion, where would she stop? Where the dutchess of Kingston did—Cherubina—or the Venus of the bath! She will uncover her arms—her bosom—and as much of her beautiful limbs, (I dare not say legs,) as very short clothes will permit; and wear flesh-coloured stockings. Why? Let her ask her own heart. If she have any, it will gush out with tears and penitence. Is she so covetous of admiration? Did she know the thought that such a display excites in the heart of a man, she would blush all over. Nay, what is religion with you? What—but a periodical fashion? I once heard one man say to another, in passing through a large southern city of America— “What a multitude of people go to church, here!”— “True,” said the other. “What a multitude of women have new bonnets, here!” said his wife. Zounds! what a satire upon your piety!—unintentional, to be sure, yet how true! Since then, I have observed, that people; and women, in particular, are never so devout, as when the change of seasons, from cold to warm, or from warm to cold—no matter which—first comes on—for then, they are in all their newness of dress and finery. Nay, on a swarming Sunday, I would bet ten to one, without looking, that there was a change in some fashion or other—or a late arrival of new bonnets. Your extravagance, too—merciful heaven! What will become of you, at this rate, if you never marry; for you never will, unless to a fool or a bankrupt? And what will become of your husbands, if you do? I feel what I say. Unless you reform, you will be a nation of miserable, neglected, uncultivated, peevish creatures, who are virgins, by necessity—for whom no man ought to care; for you will be companions for nobody; and with whom, no man but a fortune-hunter would dare to mate; and he, only that he might vie with you, for a little time, in your foolish prodigality. Am I severe?— You deserve it. How much is your father worth? How many children has he? What is the income of his property, at six per cent.? What are his household expenses? How much do you—you, yourself, expend for him, in the course of a single month? Answer me these questions, and you will soon forgive me—unless you are wicked enough to persist, in spite of calculation; and willing to see your father beggared and disgraced, by your intemperate folly. Women!—ye had better have a few laces and bonnets the less, and a man to protect you, when your father is dead, and your family scattered! You charge us with marrying for money. Right—it is a choice between positive starvation, and the chance of escaping it, that we look for. A friend of mine used to say, “I will never marry for money. But I cannot support a wife;—it is out of the question, as girls are now educated in America. I can marry a woman with one hundred thousand dollars. Now, suppose that I refuse her; and marry one, not worth a farthing—do I not, in reality, give one hundred thousand dollars for a wife? Aye, indeed do I;—and I cannot afford that; particularly, when I have to support her, after marriage. Never marry an heiress—never; it is a part of female arithmetick, that she, who brings you ten thousand dollars, is entitled to spend five thousand a year; nor can you persuade her, that such an expenditure will ever affect the principal.” Woman, forgive me. Did I love thee, less---did I revere thee, less---I should deal more tenderly with thee. I should say, verily, thou art beautiful; but, as it is, I can only say---God forgive thee! Were fashion to bid thee, thou wouldst go utterly naked among the very brute animals! God forgive thee!</field>

I will ramble no longer. I am weary of it. Hence-forward, my path shall be direct. A few more trials— a few more proofs of an untried spirit—the brief valour of a coward; and I go to a theme of deeper intention— that of Love!—thence, to my history, as it hath truly been, with all the shadow, storm and brightness of it.—Yes! —I will stand shivering upon the brink, no longer. Reader, whoever, and whatever thou art, have patience with me, for a little time; and thou shalt find that I have not detained thee too long upon the matters of my boyhood. With all my suffering and humiliation, that has been the only pleasant season of my life; the summer time, though the rain did, here and there, beat upon me, and the hot sun scorch me; yet, I cannot bear to think of it; for then, I was innocent. Not long after the last transaction, in which my breath and blood mingled with the hot breath and blood of another, while our limbs were locked and rivetted together, in a brief, but mortal tumult of wrath, I learnt, by accident, something of the broad-sword exercise. I was not very expert; but I was fearless, strong of arm, and quick of eye; and soon found, that I was more than a match, for some of the scientifick. This made me vain and boastful. It happened, one day, that I was passing a door, about which I saw some boys assembled. I stopped, and inquired the cause. It was a fencing school, they told me; and the instructor was then giving lessons. I had never been in one; never seen any other fencing, than the ridiculous stuff, upon the stage; and I entered the room, without the slightest disposition to be known. I saw some pretty good playing; and, in N 2 the centre of the floor, I observed a pair of swords, steel broad-swords, lying across. I would have asked the reason, but I was unwilling to expose my own ignorance; and I stood, several minutes, waiting, like some awkward fellow at a dinner table, watching the conduct of all about him, afraid to touch a single dish, till he had profited by the management of a more experienced hand, in approaching it; cudgelling my brains, to discover the purpose of these two blades, lying athwart, in this way; and looking about, upon the scholars and spectators, who were about thirty, I suppose, in number, to see what they would do next. While I was listening, a bustle was heard at the door, and a man broke through, calling me by name. It was a friend of mine, who had heard, heaven knows how, that I had come to fight the broad-sword teacher. Some minutes passed, before I could make him understand me; and I did not succeed, till I saw several of the scholars gathered round the master, and looking and pointing at me, while they talked to him, with an eager and vehement gesture. His countenance grew inflamed—and, just then, as the devil would have it, I happened to look down, and see the crossed blades, at my feet. I should have stood on them, at the next step; or, perhaps, displaced them, with my feet. I stooped, and took up one —as I hope for mercy, with the most pacifick disposition in the world; in utter ignorance that it was accepting the challenge—for point and blade too, which had been offered, in foolish ostentation, by the teacher, rather as a matter of show, than of a real defiance, to all who collected, when the scholars were there. Hardly was the hilt in my hand; hardly had I rested the point upon the floor; felt the edge, and bent the blade; when I heard somebody breathing hard at my side. I turned. The instructer himself stood there; his countenance white with anger—holding the other sword upon guard —as if prepared to cut me into ounce pieces. I do confess that I was frightened. I knew not what I had done; but something, not entirely right, I was sure.— It was a minute or two, before he could speak; and, when he did, I discovered that our number was reduced to about a dozen—the door locked, and benches piled up against it, and a ring formed round us. The scoundrel began to menace me, by flourishing the sword about, in the air; (it whistled, vilely, I confess) and then to abuse me. He charged me with coming there to insult him—to bully him—but swore, most bitterly, that he was not afraid of any man that ever lived; nay, that he could beat any man on the face of the globe, with a broad-sword. I would have offered an apology—but there was no opportunity—no time for it. I was afraid of him. What could I do? He had been told that I was a great swordsman. He had seen me take up his challenge; as if it were mere play with me, to fight with steel blades. I had not the courage, to acknowledge my ignorance of the ceremonies and regulations of a fencing academy. I was ashamed to say that I had taken up the sword, merely to look at it, ignorant that it was a challenge. That would have appeared like cowardice; because, nobody would believe that I, who played so well, could be so ignorant, of the commonest thing in a school of arms; and, more than all, I was afraid of myself—too little master of myself, to explain the matter like a gentleman. I looked at him—into his eyes—into his very heart; and, as I did so, I took courage; I saw that he was getting afraid of me, in his turn; and that my cold, silent manner, (which really proceeded from ignorance and fear,) was awful to him. “May I not carry it through?” said I, to myself. I looked at him with a pleasant countenance, I am told, although it was rather pale. I threw myself upon guard, in my own way. He looked astonished—hesitated. “Let us go through the six divisions, first;” said he— rather sullenly, “before we begin.” “No—” said I, unwilling to expose myself; “I have no time to waste. You have had the folly and rashness to challenge a whole community, and to insult me, till I can put up with it, no longer; and I shall do my best, to punish your presumption. Come on.” The ring contracted. “A little more room—” said I, with a flourish of my sword, that whistled like a rattan, in the wind. He was afraid. His countenance fell. I could perceive that he was willing to compromise the affair; but my own accursed folly and cowardice, prevented me from doing then, what I could have done, with a single word. I might have appeased him; and come out of the affair, with flying colours;—but, I was willing to carry a high hand over him. In short, I continued to provoke him, until he struck at my head. That was enough. I forgot, instantly, that we were playing with steel—and gave in my blows, though the sparkles and ringing were terrible, for a minute or two; just as if they were the wooden cudgels, with which I had been accustomed, from my boyhood, to exercise myself. I received a cut; or rather, a bruize; for, it was with the flat of the sword, in my forehead--a rather severe one too, for it staggered me, and set my ears ringing—at the same moment that I severed, with an awkward blow, and altogether by accident, in attempting to cut four, the tendons of wrist. His fingers relaxed, and the sword fell from his hand. I was blinded and giddy—my face was covered with blood, and I had half a mind to give him another thrust, when I saw him stagger; but, I forebore, amid the general shouting of acclamation and applause. So ended this affair. A perilous one, indeed, to me; for, my blood will run cold now, while I recall the savage and exasperated expression of that scoundrel's features. I am sure that he would have slain me, if he could; and once—once—I am willing to confess it, I did try to kill him. But, we were so hot and furious, that neither of us gave edge and point properly. He spoke, afterward, of me, I heard —and always maintained, what was true—that I did not understand the broad-sword. But, the world thought differently. They could see that my way was not his; but, as I had conquered him, and held my peace---just as if it had been a certain thing with me—and, altogether, a matter of indifference, they naturally concluded that mine was the best. Fools! If the man had not been frightened; or, if I had not given him an accidental blow, that disabled him, I should have been limbed and hewed down by him, in three minutes. Since then, I have had some amusing adventures, of a similar nature; which, if I remember in their proper places, I shall hereafter relate.—But, to those of my youth, now; for the purpose of showing that there was a natural readiness in me, for good, as well as evil. One bright, moonlight evening, and near midnight, in the dead of winter, I heard once, when I was quite a youth, as I was passing quietly along, to my solitary room, a cry of murder; so near me, as I thought; and so frightfully distinct, that my blood thrilled, and I leaped upright, from the ground where I stood—expecting to see the deed doing, at my very elbow. A window was thrown up, violently, at a little distance; a woman put her head out, and shrieked, in a desperate voice, “murder! murder!”—I had no arms—nothing but a light stick. I left my cloak in the street, and ran to the house; and was just ready to stave the door in, which I could have done, I am sure, with a single effort—when I heard the cry, from another quarter; and saw the same woman again, wringing her hands, running about the room, which was light enough for me to see every thing in it—and shrieking for “the watch!— the watch!”—By heaven, it would seem, in that city, that the watch were leagued with every villain that chose to depredate upon the people. They are always, I believe, the most reverend, pacifick, sober, quiet, and orderly old men, to be found in the whole place— the best of examples—going to bed, betimes, and sleeping soundly. I set off, in the direction to which she pointed. The snow was deep; and a heavy thaw had rendered it almost impossible to run through it; at every step, I slumped in, up to my waist; but the cries continued, till I thought that all the people in the world, were either dead or deaf. I know not how long—but it appeared to me, that an incredible time lapsed, before I saw another living creature in motion. At last, I came in sight of a large sleigh, with two horses, standing in the road, near to the vacant lot, through which I had passed; and, just then, two persons rushed out of a narrow alley, near me—as I then supposed, on the same errand that I was. They appeared terrified—stopped—. “Go that way;” said I—“and I will go this—we shall be sure of the villain, then.” “Aye!—aye! sir?”—they both cried; and sprang off, up the blind alley, like two wild cats. They appeared mighty zealous, I thought, at the time, to obey me—but that, I attributed to a certain air of authority about me, of which I have before spoken. A few moments brought me to the spot. There lay one poor boy, bleeding upon the snow, with his head cut open, and the reins of two powerful horses, wound round and round his body; and another, near him, standing up, and shrieking at every breath, as if he had a knife in him. I enquired into the affair; and soon had the best reason in the world, to believe, that the two men, whom I had just met, were the rascals that had done the deed; and that their object was, undoubtedly, to get possession of the horses and sleigh, as they saw it pass them, with these two little boys in it, who, it appeared, had been employed, one as a driver, and the other as a servant, in a large sleighing party, that night. Had I known this, when I met the men, I should, certainly, have collared them both, in my fright, upon the spot; and I never should have let go my hold, I am sure, until my arms had been cut from my body. Dead, or alive, I should have clung to them. But who, that was strong, and desperate with terrour and passion, would not have done the same thing? The ruffians were never taken. Many and many have been the occasions, where I have found this promptitude, this wild energy, of more use to me, than the strength of Goliah. I was in the theatre, once, I remember—nay, I have been there a dozen times; when it was my only safety;—but, on this occasion, a fellow insulted a woman near me. She was unprotected—a prostitute, I believe—a stranger to me, thank heaven—and likely to remain so, all her life; for I had no relish for dishonour and shame; but, she was a woman—and that was enough. I interfered; but the fellow grew scurrilous—and “dared me out.” The eyes of the people below, were already upon me; and no man could be more sensible than I, of such a reputation, as I should probably acquire, by a scuffle in the gallery of a theatre—that of a bully to a strumpet, perhaps.—Yet, I followed him; and before he had set his foot fairly upon the floor, outside, I gave him a blow that laid him sprawling. He arose, and was making at me, like an old bruiser—when I gave him my hand —saying “damn it, Jack, fair play!—would ye come athwart a shipmate, in the wake of a fine woman—hey?” He stopped—stared at me. “Tip us your daddle; boy—blast my eyes!” said he—“what'll you drink?” I was obliged to take something; so I look a glass of wine, in lieu of a flogging. I was passing a street too, one day—talking, very busily to a companion; and, in leaning toward him, with my opposite arm a-kimbo, I struck a large man, so forcibly, in the—abdomen—that he whirled about, two or three times, grunting, all the time, with a loud noise; rounded to, with a tremendous belch; and was just on the point of levelling me. “Sir—” said I, touching my hat, most respectfully— “I beg your pardon—sir.” What could he do? I am sure, from the man's looks, that he would have given half of his worldly property, that I had not begged it. And I am sure that I had better have given all mine, than not have begged it. On another day—no, on another evening—one night —the devil! I shall never tell the story, in this way—I was in a ball room. Some ladies begged me to lead the way, through a door that was crowded. I went before; and, in my sweetest manner, as I thought, made way, among the puppies and fools that stood about it. I had hardly returned, when a stout, brutal, vulgar, blackguard looking fellow, in a military undress, whom I had before seen, and thought, (nay, perhaps said—for nothing was more natural to me then, than to say, whatever I thought of anybody, and to anybody)—had no business there—came up to me, and asked me “what I had turned him round for.” My first notion was, that, some half pay scoundrel had, probably, been cashiered in the army; and willing to re-establish his character, by a squabble with a peaceable citizen; was about to pick a quarrel with me; as nobody ever had more of that careless frivolity of manner, which appears to promise impunity, than I, on some occasions; and, as there was somewhat of an air of fashion about me—that, he had chosen me for the purpose. “Turned you round! sir;” said I, in astonishment; and yet, with a look of scornful, settled contempt. A lady, who knew me well, said that she never saw my forehead, or eyes, half so steadfast. He coloured—began to talk loud—among the ladies too! “My name is Codman,” said he. “And what the devil do you suppose I care,” said I, “if your name be Codman. My name is Bill Adams.” My manner tortured him like a mad bull. He nodded, threateningly; and gave me a loud hint, to go down stairs with him. Now, I confess, that I expected nothing less than a brutal scuffle; and a severe beating, into the bargain; from the thick headed, broad shouldered ruffian; and I confess, too, that I was mortally afraid; and that my mouth grew, instantly, as dry as ashes. Yet, I answered, immediately, “with all my heart, sir;” and led the way. We arrived at the place, where a man, who sold the tickets, was placed, at a table. My antagonist, here, instead of knocking me down, for which I was thoroughly prepared, began to renew the dispute, in words. I looked at him, from head to foot. “Sir,” said I, “I have already told you, that I did not turn you round, or put my hands upon you. It is not my way; or, if it were, I should never deny it. Somebody else must have done it.” (He had said that I put my hands upon his shoulder, and whirled him, one complete revolution, before he could see my face!) What I said, seemed to satisfy him; and he returned up stairs, growling, bravely, as he went, like some animal that had ran his head against a post; and muttering, just loud enough to be heard—“If any man turn me round again, I'll pull his nose!” I smiled— entered the room;—and, before five minutes had elapsed, heard a man behind me, speaking of some one, that had begged pardon of—” I did not wait to hear the rest; but, kindling at the thought, (for it never entered my head, that he could mean anybody but me)—I went up to him, touched him, and gave him a nod to follow me. He obeyed. And I was just on the point of kicking him, for he was much smaller than I, when I happened to think of speaking to him, first. The result was laughable—and, a severe lesson to my natural vehemence and jealousy. His conversation had nothing to do with me and Colonel Codman. “What!” said I, “not colonel Codman--of the twenty-third.” “The same.” “Is it possible!”—I cried. “Why he has the reputation of being a gentleman, and a brave fellow. Are you sure?” I made some inquiry, and soon found that the man whom I had taken for a quarrelsome, overbearing, vulgar, broken lieutenant, was in reality a man, whose courage and courtesy, I had never heard questioned, at that time This changed the whole face of transaction. I wondered now, at his forbearance. I went to him. I called him out. I made an apology to him for the manner, in which I treated him, after he spoke to me--telling him what had been my opinion. He took my hands—his voice quaked, a strong emotion shook his whole frame. “By God! said he (these soldiers will swear—when in uniform) I would die for you!” He was quite as glad as I, I am sure, at the reconciliation. Reader—Can you see nothing of my nature in that transaction? nothing of your own? precipation; cowardice; folly; impudence; rashness; and magnanimity? Again—I was walking the streets of New York, one evening, locked arm in arm, with a determined, wild fellow. We had just left the dinner table, and, I may as well own it—were ripe for anything. We agreed to turn out for nobody—to go into the middle of the O side walk, and take up as much room, with arm braced, and elbows out, as we conveniently could. There is a strange point of honour among boys, fools, and madmen, on such occasions. Neither would have flinched, I am sure, from a drawn sword. We were in Pearl street. The first person, that we met, was a venerable man. He came on my side. My heart smote me; but he had to turn out. The next was a beautiful woman; a mother, I dare say, or about to be one—still on my side! I expostulated more reverently with her, bowing as I stood still—she had to turn out. The third, the devil was in the luck!--was a tremendous fellow—that I own-coming on my side too. I did not like to encounter him; and so managed, that, I threw my companion, who was a little near sighted, and did not see him so soon, in his way—the man looked at us; and, as if he suspected our design, sheered into the gutter, as one would to avoid a wild beast. By heaven, it was too bad! I insisted on changing sides; but hardly was it done, than I saw a fiery looking blade, setting himself, to all appearance for the same spirit. I was desperate: we quickened our pace; he did the same—and, such was the amazing impetus, that we acquired, by moving together, that, when my elbow struck him, he belched out a sound, as if his bowels were crushed—and was actually lifted from the pavement.—He tumbled up the steps near him; and broke through the front door of a large, handsome house, with the weight and violence of the fall!—fact. There was no time to parley, now. We turned the next corner, at double quick time; and then ran home, by different ways, as if the devil were after us. And once, too, how unwilling we are to suffer—what we are most willing to inflict!—I was walking one Sunday with a gentleman—(fact! though it was in a large city crowded with people)—a rascal ran against me, with his companion. I called out to him, it was of a Sunday, and the streets were full—that he was a blackguard scoundrel. “What's that?” said he, stopping, and facing me—it was probable that he meant to intimidate me. “Say that again, if you dare.” I left my friend, a lame fellow, behind—walked leisurely toward him; and then pronounced, in my very best manner (for I can be very gracious) the same words again. The fellow turned on his heel, saying that he'd be d—d, if I didn't run against him first! But so it was—I escaped a severe and disgraceful affair, solely by my fear of myself—by my presence of mind, and resolute eyes. About this time, I am inclined to think that I had a very bad heart. Many things occurred, that go far, now, while I reflect upon them calmly, to make me believe it. For example; a man whom I had once known, a talkative, bragging, good natured, lying fellow, came to see me. I was with a friend, standing at a merchant's desk. The poor wretch, of whom I spoke, had a large warehouse to cross, before we could meet; and he was confoundedly put to it, I remember, to keep his countenance, while he approached. I had determined to cut his acquaintance; for, I had good reason to believe that he was a villain. I stood still, eying him as he approached; he came up, smiling, and talking all the way; and offered me his hand, laying it upon the desk, before my face. “Take that away,” said I, without moving a muscle. The poor fellow obeyed; aye, obeyed!—By Jehovah! if it had been me, I would have trodden the heart out, of any man that had treated me so. I remember that he went out; and, when he had gone, my friend, a dear and true friend at that time—who loved me, stood looking at me with amazement:—the water was in his dark eyes—he had known me long—he had never, never seen me so deliberately stab into the very heart of any human creature before. I never shall forget the look of his eyes, when he said—“well, well! I would not have believed it possible!” They were full of alarm and sorrow. I have never forgotten his words; and, many a time since, when I have been ready to strike down the proffered hand of some fool or scoundrel, I have hesitated; striven with myself, and taken it, meekly, at last, as I would touch a cold, dead serpent. So ready was I at this period to quarrel with everybody, who manifested a disposition to quarrel; being continually goaded on by a belief that people thought me a coward; and yet so ready to risk my life and limbs, in preventing other people from it, as many and many a time, to fight my way, literally, into a mob, for the purpose of separating them, or rescuing some wretch. Yes! often have I done this; and the remembrance of it gives me a consolation, that I want now; now, while my very hands are red with—no—no—not yet—let me stay where we are a while longer—I dread to tell that yet. I would keep from it, as long as possible. There was a diseased sensibility about me, for nearly three years, the vestiges of which, I fear, are yet in my constitution; an unhealthy, jealous, irritable soreness of heart. Let me give an example. A ferocious ruffian had cheated me in some wood. I saw him a few days after, attempting to cheat another. He had forgotten me. We stood upon a high flight of steps. I cautioned the person against him, adding my reasons. “Now, you may know,” said the rascal, addressing the other, “that he is telling you a lie.” I raised my arm. I was on the point of knocking him off the steps, into a place, where he would infallibly have been killed; but I hesitated. The fellow seemed unconscious of what he had said, and of his danger. I went nearer to him. Our faces almost touched. “Repeat that, once more,” said I, “and I will knock you down.” “Ah!” said he, “are you up to that, my fine fellow! jest come down here, that's all: jest come down here, a bit.” Saying this, he ran down the steps, and stood upon the side walk. I followed down the steps, and went up to him, fully resolved, to destroy him, if I could, though I should burst every blood vessel in my body, if he repeated the words. True—I was, or had been, a liar—but what of that? I was the more scrupulous of my reputation.— What terrified him? He was a large, thick set, muscular fellow. Nothing but my manner. He dared not repeat it; he did not, and I was glad enough, you may be sure, that he did not, though, I do think, if he had, that I should have left him dead upon the spot,—or myself. The fact was, that the time had passed for me to think of being beaten, in that way, and live. I look back now, with wonder, at that period of my life; and ask myself, if I really was in my senses? What could I gain, by a victory over such creatures? And what a perpetual disgrace, even if I did, to a man like me! Is it not probable, that I was a little, a very little deranged? The people that I met, I remember, wherever I went, looked doubtfully at me, and always became more serious, and compassionate in their eyes—while they talked with me. Well, I was sore all over—raw, inside and out! The world had used me unkindly; and, I was sure, would crush me, if it could. Beside, I knew; and the knowledge fretted me night and day, like young adders in my blood, that I was a coward at heart; and it appeared to me that everybody else knew it, and presumed upon it, at this time. Therefore, did I quarrel with everybody. Soon after this, while I was yet quivering and burning all over, at the slightest approach of indignity, I happened to be coming up a street, in a thoughtful mood; a melancholy one perhaps, for there was little left in the world for me, then—when I found the side walk encumbered with a disorderly assembly of citizens in uniform. I took my way through them; and, soon after, encountered two others, of the same troop; one of whom as I passed him, uttered a sound, with a scornful movement of his lip, like pshaw! I stopped. Could it have been meant for me? Was I mad? Where was my old nature, so lofty, so unsupicious? How had it changed! and yet, though it was a mark of baseness to suspect insult, it was a proof of cowardice not to resent it, when obvious. My next thought was to go up to the man, and knock him down, upon the spot. But that would not do. I could'nt get my breath. My hands involuntarily contracted-I looked at them. They were bloodless, cold, and spotted with faint purple, like those of a drowned man. My heart was all on fire. I O 2 would'nt be rash, I thought; so, I went to my room. I sat down; it would'nt do—the pages were yellow and crimson. My penknife was bloody. All the objects about me were dancing, with a fiery quick light. I arose; I, almost-nay I could not have supported it another moment. I rushed into the street; and went in pursuit of the company, with a full determination of plucking the fellow out of the ranks, by the collar; and breaking him down to the earth, before them all—yea! though I had twenty swords in my side, before it should be done. I could'nt find them. I went, again, in pursuit of them, the next day; and left word for them both to call on me. But, while I was returning, incapable of attending to any thought but this, I saw them conversing together, at the corner of a street. I joined them, immediately, (not that I would not have gladly passed them, if I had been sure that they had not seen me,) and requested, in a cold, peremptory manner, that they would accompany me. They did so; and the guilty one, I soon observed, took especial care, to secure a retreat, by letting on, as they say there, that he had only a moment to spare, at that time; and by stopping everybody that he knew, and being very, very cordial, in his manner. I understood it well. It was just what I should have done, when I was much younger, had I been afraid; but now, afraid as I was, I played a deeper game. I led the way into my room—I locked the door upon them; and demanded a categorical answer to my questions. They were very brief; and the replies perfectly satisfactory—perfectly! They were just, exactly, what I could have most wished; for the two would have been more than a match for me, unless I had taken out my pistols to them, at once. But had they not been so satisfactory, I should have given a good account of one of them, at least, I am sure, before he could have said—Jack Robinson! I do not pretend to relate these affairs, in order, as they happened, but only as they occur to my recollection. The following has just come to me. I was preparing to throw by the record; and, though it have little to do with the rest; inasmuch as no scuffle ensued, yet it is important, as it led to the development of a new faculty in me—that of persuasion. I was in the little town of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, incog. I was young, fiery, adventurous and desperate, about to hazard an undertaking, upon which, all my future prospect in life might depend. Worn out, and exhausted with incessant study and meditation, I was persuaded, one Sunday evening to go to a church, where a Methodist gentleman held forth; a strong minded, sensible, but zealous and imprudent man. I sat upon the first bench, with a young fellow who accompanied me. In looking about. I recognised two or three pretty women, whom I had seen some days before. They had promised to go with me, to church, this evening; and had run away from me. We exchanged looks of intelligence. Soon after, some persons kept going in, and out—the minister stopped, and requested anybody to put an end to the disturbance. I was somewhat wearied, not with the sermon; not with the place, for, light as my heart is at times, there is that, in the sanctuary of the Lord, call it what you please, a Conventicle, Church, Synagogue, Temple, Meeting-house, Chapel, Mosque, a Cathedral—and I have been in all—which will make it heavy with awe when I am there:—and I feel much more reverence for sacred things, than I ever affect, or profess—a fault, I admit, but a less fault, than to feel less, than one pretends. I yawned—and, perhaps, I stretched—yet no man listened to the sermon with more attention than I; and though I neither groaned; rolled up my hateful eyes; nor smote my breast; yet, when I came away, I could have repeated more of the discourse (without remembering the text, too) than all the rest of the assembly. But my manner was not devout. In a little time, something occurred to disturb me confoundedly—one of the candles, under the pulpit, had been badly dipped; the week was all on one side; and, after a few minutes, it fell down, with a bright blaze, and a thick smoke; and a smell like beef steak broiling; six inches, at least, below the candle stick. A great bony fellow eyed it, till he was obliged to move, lest the pulpit should take fire. I saw him get up; and he was so long about it, and so long in his person, that I thought he would never finish getting up. It was like a clock work-I had seen masts and pumps, frequently, set in the same way. He went forward a few steps; but his great cowhide shoes made such a heavy clattering, that he kicked them off, on the way; and went barefooted to the candle; snuffed the burning wick with his fingers; and, when it fell, forgetting that he was barefooted; he set his foot upon it, Heaven! how he jumped and bounced!-The hot tallow, half a gill of which had fallen, and the wick all of a bright blaze, stuck to his naked soles, like a serpent of fire. It was quite too much for me. I never had a heart so base and wicked, as to delight in the suffering of any creature; but, when I saw the wick drop, and his foot lifted, I foresaw all the ridiculous consequences, so vividly and instantaneously, that I snorted aloud; the poor fellow kept jumping about; and half the congregation jumped with him. That over; and the disturbance still continuing— people still coming in and going out; the clergyman forgot himself entirely. He lifted his voice; made a dead stop; surveyed the whole congregation with an angry and reproachful look; spoke of the disturbance again; its effect; and of his previous request, that somebody would go to the door and prevent it—and added, scornfully— “What! are you all afraid?” My blood was up, in an instant. I did not know what it was to be spoken so to, by mortal man. That I had been afraid, many and many a time, till my very veins shrank; was certainly a fact; but then, nobody but myself had possibly known it; and, still less, had anybody ever dared to tell me of it. I arose from my seat, the instant that he had concluded; and touched my companion; (forgetful that this movement might be mistaken for a defiance, as if I meant to go out, in the very teeth of the minister) but he dared not follow me; and I sat down again. My only object was to go to the door, to show that I was not afraid—and, to the first man who should attempt to go out, I meant to say, go back! And if he did not, I meant to knock him down, on the spot—as one of the door keepers of the church; that was all. It would have been a good lesson to the rash man, who had dared to touch our passionate infirmites, with an imputation of earthly fear and cowardice, in the place of worship. Prayers soon after followed; and, I was not a little amused, at the manner, in which the most devout among the Sisters, kept their eyes constantly upon me; for I was a stranger; and there was a spiteful eagerness in their look that kept me on the alert. Nay—when they sat down—they had a pleasant manner of putting up their feet, on the next bench before them, with their knees up to their chins—much as women sometimes will, when they are all alone; or nobody whom they care for, is before them, upon a fender; or upon the and-irons—or in the ashes. These things did unsettle my devotional feelings, I confess; and I know not whose would not have been unsetted, by the same. If there be such a man, I pity him. He must be insensible; and in him, the vital influence of religion itself would be wasted. Can the insensible be religious? No. The next day, I heard that the minister had been repeatedly to my lodgings, to see me: the good lady of the house was inconceivably alarmed, by his deportment; and, I am willing to confess, that I was not entirely tranquil. I walked out, toward evening awhile; and, when I returned, it was quite dark; but I could perceive that some stranger was in the room—a clergyman, probably, by the formal wintry feeling of the air. A dead silence followed. The people were afraid to stir. My companion, (he, who had been with me the night before.)—I could hardly hear him breathe. I had no such terrour of Divines—I had known many, some august creatures, and some—the damnedest scoundrels. (I don't often swear,) to speak plainly, and after the manner of men, that I ever did see. In a word, I knew that, to be a clergyman, was to be much better, or immeasurably worse than other men; for, is it not more appalling, to minister with unclean hands, in the very presence chamber of God, than away, and remote from him? if one can be away, and remote from him.— This gentleman seemed inclined to preserve his tremendous bearing awhile longer. His questions were general; but led, in time, to the matter in hand. “You were at church, I perceived, last night,” said he, to my companion. “Ye—ye—yes, sir; I be—be believe I was, sir,” he faltered out. “And who was the person with you?” Another dead silence. I was willing to prevent further embarrassment; and replied, in my meekest, mildest manner.—“It was I, sir.” “And what may be your name, sir?” said the minister, with the imperious tone of a schoolmaster, questioning a terrified schoolboy. My heart kept still—I was never much afraid of old men, quakers, children, women, or clergymen. I smiled to myself. I foresaw what it would lead to— his arrogance, and my temper—but— “What is your reason for asking it?” said I, calmly. “I shall not tell you, sir,” was the reply. “Sir!” said I—but I checked myself immediately— willing to retard the explosion, as long as I could. He repeated the inquiry for my name. “I shall not tell you,” said I, “until I know your business.” “Are you ashamed of it?” said he, in a voice trembling with anger. I arose—I advanced—and he arose, at the same moment, as if to rebuke me at once, and for ever. I measured his height—he was a large man. I looked at the window—it would do, I thought; there was room enough. He continued addressing himself to Mr. Murray, (my companion)—“what is his name?”—said he. “You must tell me.” “He does not know it,” said I. “I have many names.” He hesitated; and then began to talk, in a loud, threatening tone, breathing all the while like a chafed bull. “Will you tell me your business?” said I, again. “No!” said he, snappishly. “Are you ashamed of it?” said I—imitating his own manner, and using his own words. He was approaching me. “Stop! sir,” said I, in a voice, that arrested him like a thunder clap. “Stop! You do not know me. Go with me to my room. Here is no place to settle this affair”—(The window was higher there.) But Mrs. Murray interfered, half frightened out of her senses; she knew my temper. “Very well,” said I, “bring a light then, I would have the gentleman see my face. I am not the boy that he believes.” Nay, I knew, that, if he had seen it, he would not have dared to speak a loud word in my presence. I have told you before, reader, that it was very ugly—but, in wrath, it was damnable; and even in my childhood, it is said to be a fact, that my life was saved, when a little sickly cousin of mine, that lay further from the animal, was actually eaten alive, by a hog— it is a fact, I asure you—and my life was saved, because the light of the candle, left near the cradle, happened to shine upon my face. The creature had no stomach for such a repast. My body, she might have digested— but my face—by heaven! she had better been stuffed with broken junk bottles, three corned brick bats, and shattered cast iron. “Sir,” said I, (I saw the light approaching) “look at me, now.” The light flashed upon my face, while I spoke—and the man turned pale; he did, indeed. “Sir,” said I, “you have dared to treat me, to night, as a boy. Taking advantage of your size, and profession, you have said that to me, for which, if you did not wear a black coat, I would have horsewhipped you.— You are surprised at this plainness. It is my nature. You have voluntarily thrown off the protection of your sacred office; its conciliatory manner; dignity, and calmness; and come unto personal collision with a man, having all the infirmities of man.” I continued, until he shook in every joint. “Will you go with me?” said he, “to the next magistrate? “No,” said I. “Will you wait here, till I can send for you?” “I will.” He left us; and I soon followed him to the magisstrate's office. When I entered, I found him, behind a sort of counter, uncovered; and walking about, in great agitation: two or three persons there; and the magistrate, a fat, good natured, sensible looking Dutchman, and one of his own congregation too!—for my judge. I could hardly speak. I was inconceivably alarmed; yet nobody observed it. I saw that his story had been told; and that he had full possession of the magistrate's mind. I was angry, indignant, but—a thought struck me. Might I not obtain a greater triumph, by turning the tables upon the man here, than anywhere else? If I could change the opinion of that man, the magistrate, it would be—a victory indeed! I began, therefore (like the Vicar of Wakefield, when he had sinned, and was afraid of reproof,) to accuse. I took a firm, confident tone; charged “that man, there,” as a minister of heaven, with a most unbecoming and outrageous violation of duty: demanded his evidence; and repeated, (for on the way, I had been dared to repeat it, and I knew that there was no danger in it,) that, had he not been a clergyman, I should have horse-whipped him, for his insolence to me. “Horeswhipped him!” exclaimed the fat magistrate, with a look of unutterable horrour. “Horsewhip the Lord's anointel!” That is not a christian spirit. “No!” said I, “I am no christian.” “No christian!” echoed he—looking at me, as if he expected to see the blue flame issue from my mouth. I had gone far enough, now. It had always been a favourite theory with me, that, if you would make a man laugh heartily, you should begin with making him weep; and that, if you would make a woman weep, you must begin with making her laugh. Violent transitions are natural—I would sooner undertake to convert the confirmed enemy of religion, than its lukewarm friend— into a devotee. I would sooner undertake to win that woman, heart and soul, who hated me; trembled at my voice; and wept with shame, and terrour, and anger at my name, than any other. Here was a fair opportunity. The magistrate, the minister, and the whole assembly were solemn as death. I determined to set them laughing. They were mortally prejudiced against me. Could I not change their horrour and hatred to admiration? They shook at my irreligion; could I not make their hearts heave with sympathy? They believed me a trespasser upon the holy place; a profaner of God's temple; liable to exemplary punishment; could I not change their whole expectation; and make them tremble for the consequence of their suspicion to themselves? They expected concession from me.— Could I not obtain concession from them? I could. I did. Reader, it is a fact, I did all this. To make them think better of my piety. I added in the same tone, with my last remark. “No—I am no christian! I know but few that are christians. I hold it a high and responsible title—one that few men can deserve. To be a christian, to my view, is to be, not merely a creature born in a christian land; but to be a meek and lowly one; acquainted with sorrow. No, I am not a christian; I never may be; but, I could bow my forehead to the dust before any that is.” The transition was amazing! A glance or two was interchanged, at first, between the clergyman and the magistrate:—but, before I had concluded, for I said much more, in a deep, tranquil, earnest tone, that I knew would tell, they had forgotten to look at each other. Their eyes were rivetted upon me—with an expression of wonder; and something, abundantly more favourable to me. I then gave the minister a severe lecture on his own forgetfulness of duty: called for his witnesses; repeated a long part of his sermon; rebuked him for his imprudence, at church; and, at my room; and explained my conduct. He was astonished, thunder struck, agitated. I told him why I had risen; and showed him what might have been the consequence, had I pursued my intention at the door. He became more mild; hinted that he would be content with an apology; and a promise never to disturb any church again! P “What!” said I, “after I have told you, that my disposition was very serious; that I arose, not to insult you, but to fulfil your commands; that I yawned, not because I was weary of your worship; but because, I had been up late; that I laughed at such and such things,” (describing the candle, and the women, &amp;c. so vividly, that, in a few moments, both of them were convulsed with laughter—and all the company joined,) “do you look for such a foolish contradiction of myself?” “Nothing of all this had been seen. You saw nothing improper, you say.—Who did?—The women— are they pious? They say that, in prayer-time, I was ogling the girls. Where were their eyes, to discover this? Sir—I wish that you would carry me to see some of these pious ladies. I will give them a hint or two, about their mode of airing themselves, that will tend greatly to a more orderly mode of worship among you.” (I, then, described their mode of sitting; he coloured, and looked ashamed)—“No, sir—I cannot contradict myself. I have no apology to offer. I have told you what I did, and why. Where was your charity? “Charity hopeth all things.” You have condemned me, unheard. You saw nothing amiss, except, what you now confess that you had misconceived. Yet, you take the report of a woman, who ought to have had no eyes, no ears, no feeling, when at prayer, for aught but the service; you charge me with a most shameful and uninterrupted out-rage upon your forms—and they are your witnesses.— Sir, it is false. Confront me with them.” I, then, proceeded—till I was, really, so vehement and lordly, that I astonished myself. I did not believe that it was in me. I had never heard my own voice, before. It appeared to me, that I was inspired. Never had I used such language, such argument, or such gesture. My thoughts were burning and transparent; and there seemed a self-arranging power in my words, that I wondered at, when the tumult had subsided; and I thought over the whole, in the solitude and darkness of my own chamber. Two of my points were now gained! “No”—said I—“I cannot promise, never to do these things again, for they are involuntary; but this, I will promise: never to hear you again, if I can help it.”— And then, I continued, with a severe, close, and rapid criticism, upon his whole discourse; threw in some allusions to Whitfield, Jeremy Taylor, Blair, Wesley and others;told some anecdotes, till I could see the eyes of both glowing; and the lips of all, parting with a new spirit. I went further; I told no falsehood; but I knew—yes, I knew that, without uttering one word of cant, I made them all reverence my religious feeling;—and yet, I did not humour them! “And now,” said I, “look to yourselves! What have you done? Arrested a stranger, and brought him a prisoner, before you—for what? What is the crime?— This.—(I repeated the charges.) Remember—it is not your opinion, by which I am to be tried—you are not to say, whether my laughing and yawning were intentional or involuntary. That is for others to say—a jury.— And who are your witnesses? Your own congregation! Are you not ashamed of your own blindness? They are disqualified—incompetent—they are your parishioners, and a party in the affair.” They were both confounded, I could perceive—for, neither remembered that it was a misdemeanor, of which I stood charged; and, of course, that these people were witnesses; or that, at least, some could be found, who had no interest. No!—but they were terrified and awed by my manner. Who was I?—Nobody knew. My coming was mysterious; and, as we are prone to the marvellous, they began to think that I was, really, something extraordinary, in disguise. I proceeded.—“Are you aware of the consequences? —You have detained me. You are subject to an action of false imprisonment. Keep me but a single hour, and I will never leave you—never, till I obtain a judgment, that shall be an example, for ever, to such off-hand gentry.—Gentlemen, please to take notice.—I shall hold these men answerable, for all losses, that may arise out of this matter; and I warn them to release me, immediately. I could perceive the effect. They took a lower tone; and, finally, would you believe it! upon my honour it is true—instead of making any concession, or being imprisoned, as I deserved to be—the most satisfactory apologies were made to me. I was promised, that I should see my accusers, face to face, the very next day; and they shook hands with me, respectfully, with tears in their eyes, all round;—and sent me home, in peace! What a revolution! Yet, this was not all. When I called, the next day, on the good man, the preacher, to accompany him, on a visit to the ladies, who had accused me; for that, I had insisted on, lest they should be led to suppose, that the apology had come from me, I found him so humble; so contrite; so civil, that I abandoned the scheme; and, at his own particular request, walked through the city with him, side by side, to show the people, as he expressed it, that we were on truly amicable terms! Yes, reader, that is every word true; and, out of it, has grown many an important lesson to me. I learnt that punishment, prejudice, disgrace, may be always avoided, by a little presence of mind, firmness, and steadiness! even, though our heart fail us—or even where, as in my case, I had no heart at all, and my blood was like water.</field>

Merchandise...A Kentuckian...Patience! patience! patience!... Peter Raymond. There is one event—it must not be forgotten— which has just obtruded itself, like a spectre, upon my memory. I am sorry for it. It will wear, when I tell it, as it is—and all the dark, terrible consequences are seen...but an unlovely countenance. It will make you hate me, reader. Very well; I cannot help it. I have set out, to tell the truth; and I will tell it—in expiation, if it may be; and then, lay me down and die.— Many things, very many, have I done, in the heat and hurry of my blood; many, in the cool, dispassionate movement of an evil spirit; but, I know of none, that lies more heavily upon my heart, than this. It is not that I did what was an unpardonable sin. No—it is not that; but it is, that I meditated, what, had I not been stayed, by some hand, stronger than a mortal hand, would have sent me, headlong, broken, shattered and mangled, a murderer—before my Judge—with my victim in my arms—a self murderer, too—dying, in the very moment of consummation. My God!—My God!—Why hast thou not forsaken me!—I stop—I look at myself—at my hands—and shudder, all over. Can it be! I ask myself—that one, so feeble, so very feeble of heart and limb, as I am now, can ever have meditated so much--or achieved so much, of desperate wickedness, as I have. Surely, it is—no, no—would heaven it were! a dream. Let me tell it. I was about eighteen. I was a clerk in a store. Near me, there lived, the only young man, with whom I was at all intimate. His master had a mortal aversion to me, then—(but that time had soon passed) and his head clerk, a tall, thin man, hated me, yet more fervently. It was winter. I was upon the roof of the store, (that, P 2 of my master, was in the same row) shovelling off the snow. The young man, of whom I spoke, was employed, in the same way, over the store of his master. I stood, after some little frolicking, by the front wooden railing, and looked down, where I saw the head clerk, whose name was Weaver. He was occupied in cutting a way, through a high snow drift, in front of the door. This was a matter of pastime, with us all, at that day, like snow-balling. A shovel-full of snow rested upon the railing; and I snapped some of it off, with my finger, once or twice; so that it fell upon Weaver—very innocently. I assure you. Directly after, I heard a good deal of bustle and out-cry, in the street; and saw several people running over, to the opposite side, as if to see what was doing upon the roof where I was. While I was endeavouring to conjecture the cause, I heard Weaver's voice, calling, insolently enough, to be sure, to my companion, to “come down!” He obeyed—very quietly; and, the next moment, I saw a hand, with a horse-whip, followed by an inflamed visage, emerging from the scuttle. I could hardly believe my senses. I did not believe it possible that any man, and least of all, that man, would attempt to horse-whip me. But, I was not long permitted to doubt; for, the moment that he was fairly upon his feet, he began to draw the lash through his hand; saying—“now my fine fellow,—I have come to give it to you. I have born your insolence, long enough!” I took the liberty to interrupt him. The whip was raised. There was little time to be lost. Without the whip—such was the difference in our age; and such the effect, of a constitutional reverence in me, for all that were men, when I was a boy, that I am sure he could have flogged me; perhaps with little trouble; but, I felt equally sure, that, if he touched me once—but once, though it were accidentally, with that whip—that he would, probably, never leave the roof of the building, alive. “Stop!” said I. I could hardly utter a sound. I was mortally afraid, and trembled violently. I was choking. I only put up my hand—less, by heaven, in supplication for myself, than for him. “Do not—Weaver, do not touch me with the whip!” said I. He mistook me. He mistook my raised arm, for supplication. He flourished the whip. I saw it in the air; but, ere it fell—ere he could draw his breath—or utter a cry—it was wrenched from his hand—broken—hurled into the street—and he was under me, in the snow. Another moment!—and I held him in my arms, and was pressing against the wooden balustrades, with a full determination—heaven have mercy on me!—to precipitate him, and myself, headlong, upon the pavement below. I pressed, and pressed, till he turned black in the face with horrour; and the railing creaked—yielded! Another moment! and I had prevailed!—another moment! and we had both gone to hell together! But something—somebody—was it a mortal hand?—plucked me back; and I fell, overcome with exertion—breathless, and blinded, into the snow. He was upon me; but so terrified, so incapable of taking any advantage of me, though I lay, like a dead body, for a time, under him—that, at last, I upheaved him, and—I know not how—but he disappeared down the scuttle, with the speed of a wild beast—discomfited at the mouth of her own den. Where was I? I knew not. My brain whirled.— The dry snow melted from my hair, and in my bosom, till I was drenched with it. I ran down the ladder— nearly delirious with passion; went to the store where he was; and, had he not retreated within it—stood in the door; and defended himself with an iron shovel, till I had come to my senses, I should have strangled him. Reader, look at this page—this! Are the letters red? Do they look as if traced in flame? Hear me—if that man—he is now in heaven, poor fellow!—but he knows that it is true;—had he but touched me with the lash of that whip, I would never have forgiven him—never! never!—till his eyes were crushed from their sockets; and—Enough—it is too horrible. I shall go mad, if I think of it. Thank heaven!—O, thank heaven, that it did not touch me! And yet—would it be believed?—though I would rather be shot through the heart, than be struck with a horsewhip, I have been, once—nay, twice—on the point of horsewhipping a man, for a mere trifle; and that too, once, in the presence of his own wife. A fool, a knave, and a consummate liar, whose impertinence I had born for the sake of his handsome, vulgar wife, till I could bear it no longer, once told me something—I know not what, and another might not have taken notice of it— at a large dinner table. I looked at him; and, for a moment, it was a question with me, whether I should spring over the table, collar him, and kick him out of the room; or wait till he was in bed with his wife, and horsewhip him there, in her chamber. But, he was so contemptible, that I merely looked at him, and said— O, how silent they all were!—“Look you, sir—it is nothing but the presence of your wife—nothing else—that saves you. But for her, I would take you by the nose, this moment; lead you to the door; and horsewhip you the whole length of the street.” What more could I say? The creature bore it; and he was so abject, that— what could I do to him, after that? Nothing. But, a relation of his seemed inclined to take up the matter— a stout, formidable, determined fellow; and, one day, he called me to him, as he stood at the corner of a street, with a cowskin, or rattan, in his hand. I expected—I know not what; but the affair was soon settled. I was prepared for him; and his brains would have spattered the pavement, in the twinkling of an eye, if he had raised the whip. I led him to a little, snug room, where—he utterly forgot his object; and we parted, mutually disposed to cut each other's throats, on the first decent pretence—at the first convenient opportunity. It has never arrived; but it may, when we least expect it; for my part, I care not how soon—feeble as I am—old as I am—coward as I am—I have that left within me, which would give a bloody account of any human creature, who had once dared even to think of horsewhipping me. You would imagine, perhaps, that I am quarrelsome. I am not; that is, I am not the first to quarrel. I never insult another, first. I am willing to give the first blow; or the first word; or the first look; but never the first provocation; and, where I feel assured of my power. I can forbear a long time. Let me give two or three instances; few men have shown more patience than I, under injury—where I was pretty sure of the event. I will begin with the first that I can recollect. I was living in a large town; and, late one winter night, I was going home, with two other young men, when we heard some scuffle ahead; and, on coming up, found a number of young men, chock full o' fight, as they say in New-England. I interfered directly; and a pestilent little fellow took it exceedingly in dudgeon; threw off his jacket, and began to flourish his fists about. At first, I thought of quieting him—a single blow would have done it, for a fortnight; but a little more reflection, showed me the folly of such a procedure. There were a dozen, to be sure, of their party, and only three of ours; but, I am sure, that neither of us—at least, one of us, I am sure, could have thrashed the whole number. But, the more conciliatory I was, the more obstreperous were they; and, it was with some difficulty, I assure you, that I was able to get away, at all, without striking some one of them. We had gone about a dozen rods, when, elated at our meekness, the young rascals hurraed, and set up a shout. I stopped; listened; heard what it was; threw off my cloak, in the street; and, with the others at my heels, dashed into them. The affair was over in a moment: not more than a dozen blows were struck; and one of them, by a companion of mine, had floored the largest of the gang. So ended that affair. I was a merchant; but I had learned to resist indignity, though I was a merchant. It had often been my duty to kick somebody out of my store; or, to give some man a card, requesting him never to set his foot in it again: and, one day, a stout fellow, a Kentuckian, had bought some trifle of me; and one of my young men was packing it up, when he thought of making a new bargain for it. I smiled—and, as he appeared rather dissatisfied, told him to leave it. My manner was kind, I am sure. The article was unpacked, and returned He still lingered; and, at last, I was persuaded to have it packed up again, for him. But a second time—may I be hanged, if he did'nt!—the rascal had the impudence to say, that he would'nt take it. “Won't you?” said I. “We shall see.” He was twice my size. I had only one clerk in the store; and he was too much afraid of me, to be of any service, in such an affair. I went to the door; locked it; and approached my man; fully determined to beat his thick skull in—if I could! He planted himself—but it would'nt do. There was something in my manner, that frightened him. He pulled out his old leathern pocket book; counted the money, with a trembling hand; muttered that “it was no better than robbery;” and then, went into a neighbour's store, (I heard of it, at dinner) and there swore most terribly, that he would go back, and murder that “damned, infernal, impudent Irishman, that kept above!” It was with no little difficulty, that he was pacified; but, when he found that I was a yankee—only a yankee—he foamed at the mouth;—and never came near me again. Was I not patient there? Who would have been more so? Again.—A man had taken great and continued liberties with me, for a long time; we had boarded together, and both of us were overgrown boys. One day, I had returned from sporting. The room was dark, when I entered; the family were all about the table; and I was so blinded by the change, that I could not see. Both of my hands were full of shot. I was about sitting down, when he pushed away the chair, with his foot; and I fell—unable to help myself, of course; because the hands always contract upon whatever they hold, in falling—with the back of my head upon a broad iron stove. It was a wonder that my skull was not fractured upon the spot—or the stove. What did I do? What! I neither drove a knife into his ribs; nor blew out his brains, with the fowling piece at my side; nor broke a chair over his head. No—I was too patient, by far, for that; and there were ladies at the table. So, I contented myself with cursing him, till I was hoarse, and black in the face, for all the scoundrels, poltrons, and cowards, that ever lived. Was I not patient? But, if I was, what think you of his patience? He bore it all, like a lamb. Again.—At a tea-table—of which a word by and bye, for the ladies—or, what I reverence a thousand times more, the women—I was once obliged, in my own defence, to throw a gallon of boiling hot water into the face of a sea captain; who, while he was abusing me, held a sharp pointed knife at my bosom, and dared me to raise my arm. Fool! The women had been his protection till then—not my patience, or my cowardice; but, when they saw my eyes, they fled; and we were alone. It was about that time, that I began to discover in the face of every body that came near me, an expression of concern, anxiety, and compassion. I know not why it was. I was not mad; nor in a consumption; nor so strangely fashioned; that men's faces should alter, and their voices change, the moment, that they spoke to me. Yet, so it was. And the women—heaven give me patience!—no matter how full of festivity were their young hearts—troubled me in the same way.— They might say that I frightened them; but they frightened me a great deal more, I assure you. What had I done, that they should never speak to me, but in a whining, melancholy, piteous tone, as if I were half way into my grave? Why did their eyes alter; and why were their countenances fallen? But, let me return.— I stood, with the boiling hot water at my side, in a tin tea-kettle. I told him what I would do. He laughed at me; defied me; and swore, by his Maker, that, if I threw a drop upon him, or even moved my arm, he would stab me to the heart; nay, he called me a coward. That was enough. I caught up the kettle—burning hot as it was—between both hands—and hurled it at him; just so that his descending arm and knife, encountered it;—it glanced, and wounded me in the temple. It probably saved his life, and my own. He did not die, to be sure—but he might as well have died; for his face was scarred all over—and mine soon healed. Now, for the tea-table. Woman, let your first question be, if you want to know the character of a man— Does he love tea?—for, if he love tea, he must be in good health—a temperate man—a domestick man—a regular man—fond of the company of women; and, consequently, not fond of grog—tobacco—nor any strong liquor—nor addicted to the society of men—which is a very bad symptom. He had better be a solitary. Nay, I have been patient on other occasions, more trying. I have bowed to a man, that, I knew, ought to feel it an honour, to be permitted to bow to me; and I have seen him turn round, without returning it, and smile in the face of another. And yet, he is alive at this moment. Was I not patient? Am I not? What did I? I merely went up to him, while he shook, as if he were about to be summoned to his death; and the man that stood by him, a large man, quaked in his shoes, too. I can see them now. I merely went up to him, and told him, that—merely that---nothing more, I assure you---my manner was very kind---that he owed his safety to his insignificance; that, it was condescension in me to bow to him; that he knew it; that, in short, (I was afraid I should die, before I could finish the expostulation.) I would put him to death, where he stood, but for my pity and contempt for him; that I would now only put him upon his guard; else he might, some day or other, offend some gentleman, without knowing it, who might condescend to kick him, till the breath had left his body. Was'nt I patient? And once more---only once more---I am weary of these things---the very memory of them is hateful to me---painful and hot, like recent anger. A scoundrel, who had defrauded me out of a handsome sum of money, came to me; and proposed referring to me, for his character; promising to pay me, out of the proceeds of such goods as he should so purchase. His name was Peter Raymond. It is a pity that he should not be known. What did I? Did I strike him to the earth; leap upon him; and crush him to death? No;---I merely told him that, if he ever dared to come within reach of my arm, for the next ten thousand years, I would beat the breath out of his body, or soul, as the case might be!— with a few other things, that, to him, for he was much of a gentleman, it seemed, were inconceivably unpleasant. And now, reader, I have done with thee, for awhile.</field>

Boyhood...Love...First gushing of the heart...Fine specimen of an unfinished sentence...Sleep...Reflections...Love in a child ...Lydia...Jealousy...Desperation....Hammond the Dwart... Reflections...Death of Lydia. Back to my boyhood, again!—to the sweet lips and eyes of my beloved Elizabeth—the summer time of my young heart, when it was perpetually in flower, and the blood rippled through it, making melody all the day long, like the inward worshipping of a devout, and innocent spirit. Aye, back to my boyhood, love! Wilt thou follow me? The season of perfume, and purity, when every hope sprang, pinioned, like a butterfly, from my thought; and I was happy—O, so happy, in spite of all my suffering, that—that my eyes run over, at this moment, while I am thinking of it. “Though absent, I remember thee!” It was the first motto, the very first, that was ever imprinted upon my heart! I was made to love. I have loved—loved!—O how passionately!—how deliriously! Yet, that line, written, when my lips first learned to thrill at the touch of woman's, that line may be read there, yet. I would— but I cannot—I am too much agitated—these crowding, interminable, immeasurable thoughts, are painful to me. I feel a sense of soreness, all over me, as of over-wrought enjoyment, intense, electrical, and very faint, here—just here, about the region of the heart, that is intolerable. I will go to bed. To-morrow night, if it please heaven, I will take up the tale again, and tell a kinder story; show my mocked and chafed spirit, with a lovelier countenance. Morning.— I have slept since, not like a babe, upon the bosom of a mother; but, like some timid bird, blown off, and afar, from the green island that it loved; and slumbering upon the uneasy billow—perpetually, though her eyes be closed—lifting her ruffled pinion, with an agitated, tremulous movement, as if she were falling.— Such hath been my sleep. My senses have been shut; but, wherever I trod, in my sleep; wherever I lay, I went like the land-bird, dreaming upon the water; there was foraye an unquiet motion about me, that worried me, like—no. I will not attempt to compare it—there is nothing in life; that I have learnt, sorrowfully—nothing in death; that I verily believe; and I shall soon be on the way of knowing with equal certainty—so desolate and frightful, as that agitated, cold dreaming. It is just as if—gracious God! is it not?—as if you were a dead body, driven by the wind and wave—and conscious of it —a sleeping man, tangled in the green, slippery sea-weed; drifting away, all night long, over the dark and glittering population of the deep water—as if all your limbs were knotted and woven about, by thin, slender snakes. But, why do I dwell upon it? Would I delay the sweet consummation of all my suffering?—put off the evil day, as it hath been called, when I shall lie down quietly, and dream not—mingling blood, and heart, and being, with Emma—my own dear Emma— O! I cannot—reader—I cannot go on;—forgive me, awhile—I— I—I am resolved. I have re-seated myself, determined to look steadily upon the past, the beautiful past, with all its painted deceptions; and recount all that, which hath reduced me, step by step, to what I am. I have delayed it long. I have paused, and paused, and procrastinated, and postponed, and fainted over the work, until, if I mean to do it at all, I must go about it, heart and soul; and toil, diligently; yea, very diligently, night and day—till it be completed. Is it not strange? I began it with reluctance; but, my heart hath grown to it, at last; until I feel, that, when I have done with it, I shall have nothing else to do, but to lay me down, and die. You would believe, from the continual and impious levity, with which I have spoken of sacred things, since our acquaintance; (for, are we not acquainted?) and from the frightful vividness of my narration, where blood has been my theme; and, from the apparent fondness that I had to scenes of outrage and violence; that I have no heart. You are mistaken. You would be sure that I have no tenderness; no feeling of reverence for that Almighty Being, whose very name ought not to be pronounced, or written, but with locked hands, and downcast eyes, and bended knees; but, you would do me wrong. I do reverence that Being. I do delight to contemplate Him, as the Only One, to whom I am accountable, even for what I am now saying—now!— while darkness is upon the earth; and the silence of the grave about me. Why then have I permitted myself to write the awful name so frequently, and so idly, upon these pages? My answer is simply this. Every page is a transcript of my thought. Whenever I have used it, it has been, however it may appear, not from an idle habit, but from a settled design. I would do that naturally here, which all do naturally in the world. I would write, as I talk. I may be wrong. I am so—I feel that I am, in profaning his name; yet, as I cannot be a hypocrite—and, as I have set out with a great design, of putting all the evil, and all the good, of my nature, before you, I have not flinched from this; but I shall be more scrupulous, hereafter. Hitherto, I have rambled more, than I shall henceforth. “No tenderness in my heart!” Can you believe it? Do you? follow me yet a little while; and hear me tell, as I shall try to, simply and naturally, what things have happened to me, in my boyhood; and then, judge ye all of me. I pretend to nothing of sentiment I cannot readily weep; I never whine, never complain, never! but, if a heart that—no matter; follow me. You would not readily believe, I suppose, that a child of ten or twelve years of age, could feel the passion of love. You would smile, I have no doubt; and throw aside the book that told of such a love, as an idle and preposterous fabrication. Yet, ridiculous as it is, I did love, and love truly, before I was twelve years of age. You laugh. But hear me out. I am in no mood for trifling. I call not that love, which all children feel from their cradles to their graves, of the same nature, for baby-houses, hoops, dolls, carriages, husbands, wives and babies. No, but I call that love, which thins a poor creature like the consumption; bleaches the lips; lights up the eyes with a sad, mournful, rich, and melancholy lustre; sets one a trembling at the sound of another's voice; and keeps the untold name, like the musick of a sorcerer, buried in the heart, to be used only at midnight—that which wets the pillow with bitter, yet pleasant tears—takes away the appetite—sets people about all the occupation of the day, like automata—that which, when it is felt, will not let you sleep; leads you to solitary places; and seals up your mouth like death, so that you dare not, cannot tell the secret. Is not that love? If it be, and later days have made to me a sorrowful certainty that it is-then did I feel love, true, and devout, and awful love, before I was twelve. And if that be love, which the world calls so; that sweet uneasiness to be nearer, nearer, and yet more near, to some sweet one:—that which never weeps, never!— and, dares to betray itself, before all the world, by its attention; that which courts not the shadowy and silent place, where it may lie alone, and muse, and tremble with its own inexpresible thought; but goeth abroad, with an offering in its hand; telling its love to all the world —even to the beloved one!—if that, be love, I felt it—for I felt that—before I was nine years of age. Pardon me, if I dwell upon it for a moment. So hateful was my home to me, after the death of my dear mother, and my poor little brother—and Fidele—that I could not abide it for an hour. Even Elizabeth, she whom I so love yet,—she could not support me against the incessant malignity of Sammy Kelly—my life was a burden to me. Near this time, I happened to meet with a little creature, about my own age; and, soon after, was happy enough to get into the same school with her. I began to love her;—but I made a secret of it. I wrote little childish notes; crowded them into chesnut shells; threw them over the school upon her bench; and, although she did not give me any answer, I succeeded Q 2 in getting three or four distinct and emphatick floggings—in reply—from the master, for my trouble;—but what cared I for such things? Martyrdom, I knew, was all moonshine to your “true lovyers.” Beside, mine was one of the most orthodox passions in the world. I loved one, who did not care a fig for me: and she, I believe, loved another boy, who did'nt care a fig for her. Even then, I had read of Petrarch and Laura; and learnt what jealousy was; for, I hated that handsome boy, to his dying day, almost for her preference of him. At last—now for an unequivocal proof, indeed—I set about making some poetry at her;—my first notion was like that of all beginners—to make an acrostick. You will laugh at my simplicity. I was never made for a poet; but, I persevered, and, with the labour of a whole evening, when my uncle thought that I had the mumps; and the loss of one night's sleep—I, at last, perpetrated one line; what it was, I do not remember now—a great pity, I confess, where one is writing his own biography—but the next was insurmountable. Her name was Lucy.— The L, I had managed; but, for my right hand, I could not imagine another word that began with U, except uncle; and that!—ah I could not think of immortalizing my uncle in my poetry. He was too hateful to me. So, I gave up the acrostick; and! loved on, like the sunflower, through shadow and shine, till—as it hath always happened to them, that I have loved,—she got miserably married—poor girl! But—bear with me, now, reader. I do feel what I am now saying. The sweet, innocent creature, of whom I am about to speak, now, I did love, truly;— and even now, I could throw by my pen; cover my face with my hands, and weep plentifully, at the memory of her pale countenance, and holy, dark-lashed eyes.— They were very beautiful; and she, so timid, that I never heard her speak aloud, when I was nigh. If every passion was pure and intense, mine, for that child, was. I was the younger of the two; and she, I believe, rather taller than I; but very graceful. I never spoke to her; I never uttered her name; I never thought of her, but with a strange feeling of shame and alarm; as if I were profaning somewhat, that I would die to shield from profanation. I was very awkward, and rude;—such, at least, was my character;—yet she never thought me so, I am sure—Not that she was blind, or that I ceased to be awkward when with her. No! for my embarrassment then was so oppressive to us both, that neither was sensible, I am sure, of aught but the other's presence. I believe that she loved me—I love to believe so, yet. It is a comfort to me, even now, with my scarred and bruised heart to believe, that so pure and holy a creature did once really love me. It gave me a better opinion of myself—and more confidence in hereafter. You know that women are always in advance of us; always, at least, in sensation, growth and character; that a girl of ten will have more of maturity, in her manner, than a boy of fourteen; and that just at the age of twelve, when a stout boy is exactly the awkwardest of human creatures, except perhaps, a girl of ten,—a sensitive delicate girl, has many of the truest feelings of passion and love for such a boy—I know this—I have felt it.— In comparison with me, Lydia—her name was Lydia— was a woman; and her endearing manner; her beautiful, innocent, self-posession; her kind, benignant way— there was something in it, that would have awed me, had I been a man. Nay, I began to have the feeling of a man. I rose above the boys that were above me. I began to love Elizabeth, (I do not like to call her Catharine, though my father used never call her by any other name) more like a brother, because Lydia, loved her;—and I soon learnt to bear, whatever that little imp of Satan, my brother Sammy Kelly, chose to inflict upon me.— Nay, I went further. My heart began to heave with ambition; my arteries, to beat with unknown thought. And yet—as I am a living man—the only notion that I had of my own ailment, or of the remedy for it, was, that—if I could only steal to her side when she was sleeping—in the shadow of some great tree—put my lips to her cheek—and feel her soft hair, like auburn gossamer—blowing upon my forehead—I would lie down there, and remain for ever and ever, afterward, without stirring or breathing. That one should love at so early an age—and love as few men, and fewer women, ever have, or ever will love,—with deep terrour and tenderness,—is certainly a marvel; but—what think you of jealousy, at twelve, downright, burning, deadly jealousy;—that, which turns the heart green, and the eyes blood shot, in a single night—even that did I learn to feel at that age.— The first pang—O, I shall never forget it—it was just as if a frozen serpent had suddenly coiled itself about my heart, and struck into it—with one blow—even to the core. I had not seen her for many days—not for many days;—and it had begun to bear upon me, when, one evening, I happened to go by the door, and saw a man; a full grown man standing upon the steps, and talking; nay, romping with her. I stopped—a strange dizzines and darkness fell upon me. I put my hand to my eyes. I knew not where I was for a moment:—a mortal coldness stole down the ends of my fingers; and I had a strange, melancholy notion that I was going to die. I went by, however; I walked on, heedless of my way—hour after hour—and I found myself, at last, near the water. It was quite dark; and the family, I knew, would expect me. I thought of it; but, the family, all at once; and even Elizabeth, were like strangers to me. How came I by the water? I know not—it had been a place of bathing for me, many a summer before; but I had forgotten it, so long was it that I had not been there. Had some evil spirit led me thither? I sat down upon the wharf; and looked about me, utterly forgetful of the lateness of the hour—the deep, deep silence about me; and the alarm that my absence might occasion at home. It was somewhat chilly—and the water was beautifully dark and tranquil:—Not a ripple would be seen or heard; not one!—yet, I sat there, while the tide was rising, until I was nearly encompassed by the water, as if I had been gradually sinking into it. It had arisen about me; the tide was coming in, with a continual, silent, shining swell—and my feet were wet—the rock upon which I sat, was unsteadied —the town was afar off—and hushed into an awful repose—and now and then, a dim light could be seen upon the hill behind me, or on the opposite shore. I thought of Lydia;—and soon found that I had been weeping; for, when I lifted my hands, from my knees where they had been holding on. I know not how long, they felt strangely cold, and, as I put them to my face, I found it was wet—and that my mouth was covered with tears. I knew it not—it was sweet to weep as I had wept, without knowing it. Still my thought ran upon Lydia. I might die, I said to myself; perhaps she would think of me, then; perhaps, weep for me, then, as I now wept for her, and wish perhaps, that she had never permitted another---to—Ah heaven! That thought nearly strangled me. I stood upright all at once, the rock turned, and I was up to my middle in water. I was just ready to plunge—and for ever! when I recollected that the keys of the warehouse, which were entrusted to me, were in my pocket. I took them out; and was wading to the shore, with the same feeling of unutterable loneliness, when it occurred to me, weary as I was of life, that it would be cruel to afflict my dear sister; and her, who was so immeasurably dear to me, by permitting them to know that I had drowned myself, intentionally; and, therefore, I determined to strip; leave my clothes upon the wharf, a little higher up, where a ship was building; and then, perpetrate the deed. This I did, in the hope that they would suppose then, that I had been drowned in bathing; for, I was accustomed to bathe alone, at night. I did strip. I threw myself in. I strove, terrified, giddy with fear, as I was, to find the bottom; and to keep there; but, I could not. My horrour of death buoyed me up. I could not drown myself. I tried hard—desperately— but, it was impossible. My muscles refused to obey my mind. They would wrestle and leap, in spite of me; nay, they saved me, in spite of myself; but, only to repeat the attempt. I remember going to the bottom, the second time, with my hands clasped, and locked upon my bosom, and my mouth wide open—for, I was weary of holding my breath—and that is the last that I do remember; for, when I came to myself, I was naked, and lying upon the loose and decayed timber of the wharf; where the tide had left me. I attempted to arise—but, I was very sore, all over; and, on putting my hands to my face, it felt stiff, and torn—as if it were encrusted with blood. Where was I? What had happened? I soon remembered it all—and turned, ashamed and terrified, to look for my clothes. They were gone. My first feeling was that of rage; and I certainly should have leaped into the water, a third time, and never have left it again, had it been deep enough for my purpose; but, it was not; for, the tide had left me. I could see the black slimy bottom; and I turned away from a death like that, with loathing and hate. But, what was to be done? I could not return through the town, naked, cold, and shivering. While I was meditating on this, with strange, agitated, bewildered eyes, like one that cannot believe himself awake, I saw, what I took to be some person, sitting, or lying, by a corner of the cooper's shop, which stood upon the wharf. I spoke— a good deal alarmed; for, I knew that it was very late, as the lights in town were done moving about; and that, in the light-house down the bay, could be distinctly seen. I spoke—and a creature, that I soon found to be a large dog, of the Newfoundland breed, came to me. Next to my own clothes, nothing could have been so welcome to me, as the shaggy coat of this animal. He fawned upon me; and I observed that he was drenched with wet. It was he—he that had saved me. No. I was mistaken—for, another creature soon appeared, as if emerging from the darkness, carrying my clothes in its arms. I trembled with terrour, as it approached. It resembled my own brother; but, I had never seen my brother employed in anything that looked like kindness. I took them; but, could not help wondering at the hideousness of the creature. It was not so large as I, yet, the head was twice as big as mine; and the voice was like a man's. I dressed; and, it was not, until my blood began to feel warm again, that I discovered, by the strange rolling of his eyes, what it was. It was Hammond the Dwarf. My flesh crept. He was the horrour of the whole town. I instantly felt my pockets, to see if they were rifled. I remembered his preternatural strength; and how, when I had mocked at him once, and spit upon him—and laughed at his big head, he had merely said, boy that he was—and the tears gushed out of his eyes, when he said it.—True! true!—big head—big head—but big heart too. Had he a big heart?—If he had, why did he let me beat him, and spurn him, and curse him, as he did?— Why had he pursued me, lame as he was; and hunted me, within a few months, till Elizabeth, who knew how hateful he was to me, had cautioned him not to come near me? And why had he abandoned me, as he did, uttering a threat, that chilled my very blood? Was that his ferocious dog? Had he come now, for vengeance? Why did he not speak? Why did he stand there, just before me, with his great unwieldy head, as if he saw me not?—Such silence was intolerable. He walked on, up the hill—and he stopped;—I could hear him breathing hard. Might he not watch his opportunity, and provoke the dog, that fierce creature, upon me? I expected it. But he did not. We went on—he never opened his lips, nor I, mine, until I was in sight of my home—nay—nor even then, but he called off the dog, and went his way—limping, piteously. I turned round, and looked after him—there were his long arms, and great feet, and waddling head— by heaven! it was like some monster, made by different workmen—a piece at a time—at different jobs—as if one part had got cold, before the other was put to it— yet, my heart smote me, for my ingratitude; and, I yearned to go after him, and say—“would God, Hammond, that you were not so hideously ugly! I would love you, if I could!” My foot was upon the door—and, I saw him, as he turned the corner, under the lamp, put his long hands together, in the air; and stop; and hold down his head, for a moment, as if he were cruelly affected—nay, if my sight did not deceive me, there was a motion of his hands, (we were not far apart—and he stood in the light of the lamp—but, he could not see me) —as if he dashed away the water from his eyes. I went to bed, and dreamed;—ah! such dreams, of frightfulness, fire and death! and, I awoke in the morning, with a high fever. Still, still I thought of Hammond; more, perhaps, than of Lydia; for, there was, I know not what, something of an ugly soreness about here, that troubled me. What right had I to laugh at him? Who was he? what had he ever done to me, that was cruel, base, or unkind? Nothing. Was it weakness that made him so patient of insult? Oh, no—he had no match for strength. Was he a coward?—he!—Hammond a coward!—he, who struck the master himself, once, in the full school?—No. What, then, had kept his hands from me? I knew not—unless he knew that I was a coward, and was ashamed to beat me. Yet, I hated him; and was willing to believe that, either he or his dog had saved me. I could not bear to be under any obligation to him, or to think of it; and, the affair wore gradually off my mind; for, he soon went away, somewhere to school, and we had heard nothing of him, for many months—And Lydia—Ah, that blossom had been breathed upon. The purple of death was already staining it at the heart. I would not believe it. I had seen her;—and, for the first time, had dared to put my hand into hers, and look her in the face. It was our last meeting! Never shall I forget her countenance. It was deadly pale, for a moment; and then, her hand trembled; and I saw a pale shadow, rush over her temples, and neck and lips—and then, through her half shut eyes; there fell a moist, rich light—and there were tears under the lids, too—I remember that, well—well! they went directly into my heart. We never met again. But, that light, and those tears—Oh, I never shall forget them—and, when we meet again, for meet we shall, if heaven be merciful to me—I shall know her, by them. I shall see her, just as we parted last. Years have rolled away---centuries may follow---before we meet; but, if she be unaltered, I shall remember her, though we meet where it is dark---by the touch of her soft little hand, and the kiss---the hasty, doubtful kiss, that she left upon my eyelids, when I pulled her down to me, in the convulsion and tenderness of my heart. Yes, reader, she died—died.—I have brought myself to write the word, as I did, many years ago, to speak it, when it was nearly death to me. She died —and, when it was all over, and the loose earth had lain, for many a day, unvisited, unwet, upon her dear body--I went to it, and knelt down by it, and wept upon it; not because I had heard of such things, or read of them; but, simply, because it was very sweet to be near her, as I most wished to be---now, that she was gone, —in tears. Heaven! of what materials are we made--- weeping at night, upon the ground---that has hardly done echoing to the green sod, thrown upon a beloved one---and wrestling, the day through, in mortal strife with others. Her grave --it was aromatick....I knelt upon it—it is not long since...and the buried tenderness of her young heart came up, out of the earth, like a volatile exhalation, to my senses—I—I had, well nigh, never left it again---I—.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">R CHAPTER XII. Musing...Lydia...Temper...Mary...Emma..Matrimonial trial.. Jealousy...Reminisencies...Incident...Kissing...Before marriage...Mary again...Another Mary. It was no light matter, with me, to forget Lydia.— I have set up in bed, at night—(Elizabeth knows it— for, she hath found me, in the morning, there, with my arms athwart, leaning, overcome with drowsiness, against the wall.) all night long, and travelled over every incident of my life, in which she had been concerned; recalled the tone of her voice—that tender musick—the words—the look of her eyes, when I felt her heart throbbing against mine, till I shut my own, with a sense of loneliness and rapture, while the tears ran out of them, as if they had been squeezed out of my eyeballs, half in pain, half in extacy. My eyes would smart; and yet, for my life, I would not forego the luxury of weeping. It was a long, long time, that I thought of her, dreamed of her; and my temper grew, even in my solitary musing, gentler, and more indulgent; as if she were yet near me, with her compassionate dark eyes, looking in upon my heart, and agitating the blood there. Do you doubt, now, that I loved, and truly, at so early an age? You cannot. Such sympathies are not to be misunderstood. Many years have passed; very many; and yet, I cannot write that child's name, to this hour, without emotion---a melancholy, sweet feeling, as —as if her tresses were blowing over my forehead, half in delusion, half in reality. It changed my temper, as I have said; for, I have always been prone to reflect that which I loved, whatever it was; and I have loved, passionately—devoutly—timidly—as the creatures, that I loved, were passionate, timid, or devout. Nay, it would not be too much to say that, to this moment, there is a wandering melancholy upon me, at times; and a mournful dreaming, as if of a woman that did love, and dared not tell her love; nay, knew it not herself, it may be, and died. For some years, I felt all that a man could, whose heart had been widowed early, too early; and, I knew not one hurried pulsation, one agitated breathing of passion for many years. In the mean time, I had contracted many solitary, strange habits; and would go away from all the world; and lie along upon the grass; and pore over the blue water, that spread itself below me;—dreaming waywardly, oh, such dreams! till my very heart would leap, at times, like an untrained steed, to the touch of a fiery hand. It was Ambition's!—She came to me, gauntleted, glaived with steel—red from the furnace! where she had been forging a panoply, worthy of a mightier heart than mine. I spurned at it. I was weary of the conflict; faint, and sick, with the thought of blood. I only prayed that some woman; some one, it mattered not whom, if she were altogether mine, devoutly, passionately mine, might be made to love me. My prayer was vain. I had no soothing in my temper. The women that I saw, were childish. They were ashamed of me. They had no notion of love; of that deep, inward, unutterable love, of which I thought. Nor, had I, then. I knew not what love was. I only knew that, if I could find some one, that would tremble all over, when she heard my voice—that would sit mute as the hushed nightingale—when we were alone; and be happy, if her cheek rested upon my shoulder, and her fine tresses were blown out in the wind; that then, I should be happy. Would I have profaned her? No. Would I have told the tale? No. Would I have made the mystery even the subject of thought, to another? No—No!—I would have buried it, young as I was, with myrrh and frankincense, in the deepest place of all my heart; and never have let the “delicious secret out,” but when I was alone, where nothing, that had life in it, could have surprised me. Yet, there were many about me, that loved; and talked of love, till I was fain to understand the meaning of the word. But, such was not the love that I felt; of that, I could not talk—I could'nt name the name of love—I dared not even think of it; and, though she, that I had so coveted to be near, had been long dead; yet, there was a sore place, somewhere in my bosom,— I knew not exactly where,—which I prayed to have tenanted again; and yet, I was frightened at the thought of it. Long and long, did I wander about, trying image after image to the vacancy—but none would fit it—none! At one time, my heart would collapse; and then, it would distend again, while I strove to insinuate some idol into the solitary, silent place.— It would not be. The shrine was overturned, defaced! defaced! and, if it were ever to be supplied, I learnt to believe that it would be—when I should be sleeping. My belief hath been verified!—A creature did steal into it, at last!—like a brilliant serpent—when I was off my guard—but, that must not be told here. Yet, there were times, too—short seasons of sun and fragrance—when, for a moment or two, I was deluded; and once, I remember—when I had pored over my own heart, till my brain ached; and I was ready to lie down and weep myself blind, that heaven had shut itself up to me; and that no field was open to me upon earth; and that woman, even woman, was prohibited to me;—once! there was a very beautiful creature, who came near to me, for a moment. Her eyes were large, full, and of the deepest blue; her hair a glorious brown, heavy and rich, like a mass of neglected silk—unspun, unwoven; her face dimpling all over—full of laugh and witchery— O, how utterly unlike Lydia. Yet, I might have loved her—not with that holy, distant, reverential fervour, with which men worship the cold star-light, when they are mad—but with a passion half earthly. But, she was a coquette. And her beautiful mind was rank with luxuriance; putting forth incense for ever—perpetually in bloom---approachable to all the world. Could I endure this? I!---No. The woman that I love, I would have consecrate to me---to me, alone. Such is my temper, yet. I will have no companionship in love. In property, in friendship, I can go as far as another---as any other; but, in love---O, I would sooner die; yea, die, after all my experience and mortification, after— I have broken one heart by it---sent one beloved creature to an untimely grave, even while she doated upon me, to distraction---yet I would rather die---hated and feared---than live---with a sharer in my love. I am called jealous. Let it be so. I am jealous. I glory in it. The lips and eyes of the woman that I love, should be unprofaned. I would sooner enjoy a community of wives, than of love. Understand me---will you. There are some that will not; some that dare not. There was Hammond. He told me, plainly, that the woman who married me, would die—die, of a broken heart. She did. He told me, too, that I was jealous. I am. I know it. But he did not mean that I was watchful, or suspicious. No; he knew me better. He only knew, that, what the world called an innocent freedom—if permitted by my wife—would be the death of me. He said so. He told her so. I told her so. I took her hands. I looked her in the face. “Emma,” said I, “I may be wrong; it is very possible. But, it is better that you should know all, that you have to expect; all, that you have to fear. There are some things that would kill me, love; which, it never entered your innocent heart, to believe of any importance. Men come to you, and take your hand. They go away, and they take your hand. I can bear that. They dance with you; and they take your hand. I submit to it; for I see that you are happy. They lean upon your chair; and say many things, in a manner, that—pardon me, Emma—you will, if you become my wife, put an end to, without any solicitation from me. I would have you happy. I would leave you free. I shall ask you of you, not to see this man, nor that; for, but point to no question—impose no law upon you. Neither beg any man, whom you would be better acquainted with; and I will bring it about. You know that. I ask no condition from you; I exact no promise; and, when I die, if I should die first, I shall say—Emma, farewell! If you have loved me, you will never love another, who does not resemble me. There are few in this world that do. But, when you find one, that does resemble R 2 me; or that, you believe, does; marry him. I shall watch over you, even in his arms; and be happy, believe me, dear—very happy, if you are so. but, there is one thing—one that, at this hour, I do not fear to say to you;—it would be my death to see the lips of a man— no matter what his age—no matter who he is—upon your face. I would not wound you. But such things are; and I would put a stop to them. How? I would convince your understanding; and then, I shall be happy; then, I shall feel that I am safe—safe; because you will respect my opinion, not as a capricious law, but as the wise opinion of genuine love. That done, you will be as jealous as I, of such liberties. Emma, I will not even permit the parson, when we marry, to kiss you. You smile. Your father and brother may—may, I say, because I would be understood. It would not be rifling you, if they did. You can reason. Ask yourself, if it be not making such favours too cheap. A kiss! by heaven, Emma, I would as soon my wife should go to bed to another man, as to be kissed by him. She may go to bed, if she please, to her father and brother; that will not disturb me. She might go to bed to a stranger, innocently—and return to my arms, as if nothing had happened; unsullied, unprofaned. You are disturbed—hurt. Hear me out, love,” said I. “We must deal plainly, while we are upon this theme; but, could I ever love her after, as I had before? No. I might not blame her; a mistaken education; a deadened sensibility; or, a mere unwillingness to give pain, because it was one of the privileges of a friend—a dear friend—might be her justification; but, do you think, that I could ever love her again, as I had loved her? Ask yourself, Emma—would it cost you no pain, none, to see me caressing another woman? If it would not, I should be sorry indeed. If it would—will you not spare me? Remember, I ask no more than I would do. From the hour that I am yours—not your husband, Emma; but, from the hour that we have loved, I have been, and will be, yours, and yours only; and I shall be to my last breath. How would you bear it? Do not call me unkind, cruel, or capricious. I am not. I tell you, beforehand, all that you have to expect; and, if you should break my heart, hereafter, do not charge it to my jealous temper. All my jealousy, you know, now. Can you endure it. I love you too much—too much, to think of sharing you with any body. Have I convinced your understanding? Am I reasonable? If yea, then we shall be happy. If I have not; I have only to say—pity me; take compassion upon my infirmity; you know what it is;—dare you marry me, knowing it, as you do? If yes---say so. I shall be happy. You will never hear of it, again—never. It will be enough for me to know, that you are my wife. My confidence will have a sublimity in it. I shall feel, wherever I be, that you will remember your dignity and love; and that no living creature will be permitted to approach you, profanely. But, it may be, that you are not convinced.— Look about you, for a moment. Who are they, that treat this matter with the greatest indifference? Who are they, that are most willing to have their wives kissed? Are they not such as have been long married, very long? When there is, perhaps, somewhat of satiety and indifference in them. If a man be indifferent to a woman, will he care, though the “whole army, pioneers, and all, have tasted her sweet lips?” But who are they, that regard the matter most seriously?—quaking, to the very heart, at the thought of another's daring to kiss their loved ones? Are they not the newly married, or the newly loving? Which is the passion, that you would inspire? The new, or the old one? Reflect for yourself. “By their fruits shall you know them.”— What is most dear to us, we are least willing to share with the world. What is least so, we are prodigal of.” Thus did I talk to Emma. She was a noble creature. The tears stood in her eyes all the while; and she was fully convinced; but she put her two hands into mine, and said, just so that I could hear her. “I thank you, William.” I understood her. She had the courage to become the companion of one, who was the terrour of all the women that knew her;—one, against whom she had been cautioned, as a terrifick combination of jealousy— and love, to be sure, but love, that wrought with more deadliness in him, than hate in other men—but one that never deceived—one, that told her, the whole measure of his infirmity and transgression—and once—O, never shall I forget that moment. It was my reward for whole years of sorrow and of suffering. A venerable man, the friend of her childhood, with whom, when she was parting, probably for ever, put his aged lips to her forehead—a viper rather!—a burning coal! I showed no emotion. But she, my Emma---my own dear, imperial Emma, she felt that she was my wife; and that no man on earth, crowned and sceptred, though he were; priest, or layman--old or young—was worthy to touch her forehead. The old man tottered and trembled in the beautiful rebuke of her eyes. Yet there was no fierceness in it. It was lofty, calm, and gentle; and he departed—how! with ten thousand times more respect for her, that he ever had before. For a moment, he glanced at me. I saw that he could not understand the simplicity of our hearts. Perhaps---heaven forgive him, if he did;—he thought Emma was afraid to permit it, before me. I could laugh—bitterly—very bitterly, even now, at the thought; and I do love to imagine whether he would have found her kind, if she had been alone. By heaven, old as he was, beloved as he was, if her husband had not been near her, he would have been scorched to ashes. I went to him. I laid my hand upon his shoulder. I looked him up in the face. I was a good deal moved, but I smiled; for, in the deep agitation of my blood, there was an unutterable sweetness, and thrilling; as if some new fountain had just been broken up in my heart; or some gentle fingers were feelin pleasantly about it. “You do not know Emma well, I perceive. She became my wife. But—I imposed no restraint upon her. We had some peculiar notions; and, when we give our hand, to an honest man, it may be that we mean more, than many, who would give up the lips of a wife or a daughter to him.” The old man embraced me upon the spot. I felt that I was right. The reward had come, at last; and, over powered by it, I went to my study, and threw myself upon my knees,—devoutly, I do believe, if there ever went out of my heart, or ever dwelt within it, one devout thought. Emma soon joined me:—and I could not forbear reminding her of her courage, in marrying one so high, and abstract in his notion of woman.— “How had you the courage! I exclaimed—so timid a creature as you were, to throw yourself upon my bosom, love?—it was the crater of a volcano.” “True, William; very true,” was her reply—“but, timid as I was, and am, I would rather be consumed, by a bright flame, than live, for ever, in a dull one.”---- “This from you, Emma! you.” I exclaimed, in astonishment. We had then been married three years;—five had gone by, since we had first met; and I had never heard her utter so daring a sentiment as that, before. I held her to my heart. I remembered the sweet intrepidity of her eyes, when we first met; and I trembled for her. She was in deadly peril, and knew it not—never dreamed of it:—and, many and many a time, before we were married, hath fallen asleep, upon my bosom; and slept as tranquilly there, as a babe would, that had overwatched itself, in contemplating the diamond scales of a serpent. But when she awoke, there were her innocent eyes, just as when they went to sleep, full of love and security. I reminded her of the tremendous moment, when we had well nigh parted, for ever and ever:— when one that was dear to her,—a long and tried friend—almost her brother---one, that had watched over her, in sickness and in health; one, whose feeling, she could not assail idly—or wantonly—would have touched her cheek, at parting. He had followed her; our arms were linked together—and I could have prevented him, almost without an effort—but I did not. It might to be done again. I stood aloof, by heaven I did! and saw him, in the presence of his own wife, touch her cheek. O—I could have stretched him dead at my feet!—I could have fallen upon my knees; clasped her dear hands in mine; wept upon them, and sobbed out, farewell! farewell, for ever! I had broken away from one woman; one, that I dearly loved—for the very same thing; and here was another—another! I had well nigh abandoned her on the spot, and all womankind with her, at the same time. If I had, I never should have trusted to another—no, never! I should have turned my back upon them all; in bitterness, pity, scorn and detestation, as creatures wholly unworthy of me; and unworthy of my love. It was many minutes before I could speak. I could not leave her in the street. We were already at the door—a moment only, a word—might be between our love, and everlasting separation. I shuddered; I staggered—I felt faint and giddy. I spoke. “She was innocent.” True, and if she had not been—I should have gone to her, and laid my head in her lap, and blown out my brains there. But it was before me, and before his own wife; and he was like a brother—what! and is that to comfort me, that you think so little of such a favour, as to be surprised when I turn pale, if another take it before my eyes; before his wife and because, he is like a brother! Think of it. I cannot bear it. I may be wrong. If so—it is constitutional. I reminded her of all this; of all that women, foolish women had said of me, and of my nature. Fools! idiots! do they not know that it is a wretched compliment to any woman, for her husband to stand by, unmoved, when another man kisses her? I would sunder myself, for ever, from a woman, whose heart did not ache, as if it were crushed, at the thought of it. I would never do it, never! alone or apart. That would I never do, away from my wife, which I would not do, if she stood by.— No; she should feel assured, that the lips which he had consecrated at my parting, would return to her again, pure and hallowed, with her last kiss yet upon them. To my last breath---my very last---they would be sensible to no other touch---no other flavour,---no other thrill. Reader, pardon me---I have wandered far, very far; but the thought of Emma, the dear sufferer, came over me, and carried me away like her own voice, when I hear it, night after night, issuing from the wood, behind the place where we first told---no, not told, that were impossible till long after----our love---and I go astray, after it. Let me return. I was telling you of one just now, that was too kind to all; too ready to bestow her smile, and lavish her caress---upon all the world. Her name was Mary. I knew her but a little time then; but I have met her since, more than once; and left her weeping, the bitterest; and yet, perhaps, the most salutary tears, that she ever shed. She had taught me how to approach her. I profited by it; and ere she had time to look about her, she found her feet entangled, and her own heart aching; not with love; but with shame and vexation. I might have loved her; and, had I been nearer to her, when I could have moulded her to my will; and, had she submitted to it, as she might; for she had a kind heart, I might have been her friend---and, perhaps, her husband. But she had a cousin, (her name was also Mary,--a woman, even in her childhood; a creature not beautiful, but noble; dignified; and, in every respect, I do believe, better fitted to make me the wife that I ought to have had---than any that I ever met with. Her thought was like mine, but better; her ambition like mine; but less terrible, and more religious; her temper inconceivably better; and her love would have been more rational; but as deep and as breathless, as my own, for her. She is now married. Heaven bless and protect her—Reader---it is all in vain. I cannot tell the story in any other way, than as it occurs to my memory,by fits and starts. I cannot preserve any chronological order---I can only record my own associations. Bear with me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. Hammond the Dwarf...Sammy Kelly...Confoundedly scared... Apparition...Unfinished sentence...Hammond's Temper...Patience...Strength...Courage...Self possession...Readiness. I have already spoken of Hammond the Dwarf. It is now time that I speak more plainly; for, the hour is arrived, when there is not an event of my life to be related, in which he had not, in some way, directly or indirectly, a strange, wayward influence. Let me begin early, when I first knew that I hated him. It was in my earliest childhood. I have already given you some notion of the spiteful little devil, my brother—Sampson Achilles—otherwise called Sammy Kelly—and of the life that I led at home. Such was my deadly antipathy to the creature, at last, that my blood would curdle, if my flesh touched his; much as if I had trod, with my naked foot, upon a toad. The wicked readiness and dexterity of the imp, are inconceivable. I had ten times his strength; and ten times, at least, have I saved his life, when he was utterly at the mercy of some beast, or carriage; for, not a dog would pass by the door where he sat, with his tongue lolling out of his mouth, and his long white fingers clotted and ringed with bruised and broken worms ---not a dog, that did'nt stop, to bark at, or worry him. Yet, more than once, have I been on the point,---I may as well own the truth...of provoking one at him; or, letting go my hold upon him, when I was dragging him out of some puddle. He was a beast--a monster--in all but intellect---and that was instinctively devilish. His seat, in the door-way, on the steps, in the corner of the kitchen, was coloured with glittering insects, that he had crushed, and stuck to the floor; or strewed all over, with the hair of cats, or the feathers of young birds, that he had picked naked. Yet, poor thing! it was never thought possible that he could harm anybody. And, when I have been tempted to pitch him into a kettle of hot soap, or an empty flour barrel, for his cursed pranks upon Elizabeth, I have been withheld, solely by a doubt, that he might, by some possibility, have some sort of a rational soul—or, that he was too much of a devil to be hurt by it. Up to the hilt, has he driven a little sharp pen-knife, into the calf of my leg, chattering all the while, like a strangling baboon.—Again, and again, has he blistered me, with hot water; and once, it was well nigh the last moment of his life—did he throw a crucible of melted lead at poor Elizabeth, when she was very little—a part of which, fell upon her foot, and burnt, and sunk into it—till her shrieks could have been heard, for a mile; yet, when I was only going to pour the rest of it down his own ugly throat, some fool or other, my uncle, or father, perhaps, interfered —and had well nigh poured it down mine—for meddling with the “poor innocent”—as if hot lead from his hand, would'nt burn a fellow. But, I taught him a better lesson, at last. He hurled a brick at me. I just took him by the nape o' the neck. He had another in his hand—which, in his childish, pleasant, harmless way, he was just ready to throw into my face and eyes; but, I only took hold of his neck, and he yelled out, much as if a red hot blacksmith's vice had caught him there; and dropped the brick.—Never—no, never, after that, did he venture to lift his hand against me, when we were alone. I learnt how to manage him, in some degree, from that moment; for, idiot that he was, he was not so very a beast, as to repeat, what he knew would end in pain to himself; and, but for Elizabeth, whom he tortured incessantly, in one way or another; worrying her, with vermin and bugs; filling all her little boxes and playthings, with whatever was most hateful to her, I should have gone on, peaceable enough. I have thumped him for it, till he was spotted all over; choked him for it, till his eyes were starting out of their sockets—but, he would never shriek out; or complain; and, the moment that my back was turned, he would be at his mischief again; growling, all the time, like a bear, with a sore head. S About this time, just when I had pretty well made up my mind, to let the next dog that should attempt it, throttle him, at his leisure—I happened to be out, late of a holiday afternoon, in a dismal wood; dark and swampy, and tangled, where I had gone after black whortleberries. It was already dusk; I was alone, and had far to go—and withal, was a terrible coward—as I have already told you. I was just clambering over a high fence, I remember, with the dish in my hand, full of whortleberries; and getting ready to leap—when I uttered a loud cry, and dropped them. Below me, were a pair of large rolling eyes, of frightful vividness. It was a creature, with a big head; and its long arms were reaching up toward me. “Sa—Sa—Sammy—dear!” cried I, as soon as I could get my breath—“is it you, Sammy?” I was never so glad of any thing in my life; but, I soon recollected myself. It could not be Sammy—he had never left the door of our house. My heart bounced again—and my teeth chattered with affright, as I saw it, clambering up the fence, toward me—and I—by heaven, it was like the night-mare to me; I could neither move, nor bawl, nor speak. It almost touched me —and I leaped down upon it, in desperation, and ran. But, it pursued me, and overtook me, and spoke to me. I looked down—but, my terrour was so unspeakable, that I could see nothing; and, I actually yelled out with horrour. It turned, and left me, at last; running along the ground, like a shadow; and, whistling, all the while, with a loud, clear whistle, like the wind, in December. I followed it, in amazement, for a moment, with my eyes—saw it leap ditch after ditch—and then, aim directly for the swamp. I took to my heels, and ran, as if I had escaped a devil—till I came to the house.— There was little Sammy; there in the corner! just where I had left him; with a poor little pinched up, sore-eyed kitten, in his lap, mewing, most piteously, at every touch, as if she had been tortured, till she was dislocated, and raw. On any other occasion, I should have snatched her away; but; on this, I forgot all humanity; or, rather, all the little that I had—in my eagerness to be alone, where I could meditate, without disturbance. “Well,—it was not Sammy,” I had said, to myself, for the hundredth time.—“But, what the devil was it, then?—A monster? Yes. But, that cannot be. Can there be such another as he? What a fiend it must be! How it ran and whistled! Yes—there are more of them. I must get a dog. I won't go abroad again, after whortleberries, without a dog.” I went to bed; but, half a dozen times, did I awake, screaming with affright; and fancying that the creature was chasing me yet, and chattering over my shoulder— just overtaking me—that his boneless fingers, were just touching me—I could feel them mounting to my throat—hear his whistle; and—God of heaven!— Was it there, still! I leaped from the bed. It was no dream. There sat the little monster, in the moonlight, just upon the foot of my bed, looking me in the face, and supporting its head, between its two paws. I shook, in every joint. I was ready to sink into the floor, with affright. It laughed.—Oh no! no! no!—it was not he!—no!—it was not he—It was poor little Sammy, himself. I could have wept tears of joy. I even ran to him; and would have hugged him, but he hopped down from the bed, and waddled away, into his kennel. My cries, it seemed, when I inquired into the affair, had disturbed him; and, he had come to enjoy them—to listen to them— they were musick to him;---and I might have lain there, bellowing till this time, for all that he cared. Still, I could not get the creature that I had seen, out of my head. I was afraid to go to sleep again; and, it was a twelve month, before I had the courage to go near the spot, where I had dropped the dish and the berries. To me, there was an association, so natural, (for, all the experience that I had, led only to that conclusion) that, whatever was monstrous in people, was devilish, like little Sammy---that, if I heard of a calf, with six legs, or a kitten, with two heads, I was afraid to go near it. But, a whole year afterward,--(I had made two or three attempts before)---I went to the place. There was the dish still---a large tin dipper---just where it had fallen---but upright. I looked at it---there was a thick, black mould, in the bottom of it; as if the berries had all been gathered up again, and left there, after I had gone. I was almost afraid to touch it. But, I did, at last, and found that my conjecture was right. Some time after this, a cousin of mine came down, and stayed with my father, “for to go to school;” as they said. The moment that he saw Sammy, he started; and, when we were alone, he told me that he thought it was Hammond the Dwarf. “What! more dwarfs?” thought I. “Why, what the devil are such creatures made for?” I did not know, then, as I do now, that vermin have their use---that they tend to cleanliness; for, people will wash themselves, to get rid of lice; and scald their bedsteads, to get rid of bugs; when, but for lice and bugs, they would live till they rotted away in pestilence and nastiness.---So with reptiles and serpents---I once heard a good man, speaking of God's kindness to us; in proof of which, he remarked, that lions and vipers bear only one young at a time! ([5] [5] The Editor of the Morning Chronicle, Baltimore, once wrote the same thing, and reasoned in the same way. Lions!) while such as were useful, bore frequently, and in litters. Ah, thought I. Would it not have been, to the full, as kind---if there were none at all, or if they were utterly barren. Why worry us at all with them? I can not explain the riddle, even yet. But, Lions, Vipers and Dwarfs are necessary, and good....I am sure....for, hath not God made them? I soon learnt from my cousin, that, in a little log hut, near the whortleberry swamp, (where I had been) was a family of wretched creatures; and, among them, a dwarf, that looked like little Sammy. This gave me comfort; and, I determined to see it; for my cousin promised to bring it about; but, though we went twice near the place, and saw all the rest of the family, we always missed Hammond. But, when I had nearly given up the thought---I was then about eleven, and began to be known as Neck or Nothing, by every body—I returned, one day, from a fight with a school-fellow; and saw, just as I was entering the door, another creature, like Sammy, sitting upon the steps, opposite to him. I stopped—and shuddered. They were looking in each other's faces; and neither made a sign, or spoke a word, for ten minutes. I was called, and had to go in, between them; but, as I did, the stranger rose, and went with me. He was taller than I, though; and, his great, white glittering teeth---and the most beautiful mouth in the world, though his eyes were horrible---threw me into such a perturbation, that I knew not what I said or did. We sat down to the table together; and, I could not eat a mouthful. I kept my eyes rivetted upon Hammond, (for it was he) and I was amazed at his manly air; it was thoughtful and old; and when he spoke, (though he was but thirteen) I found my father listening to him, with great earnestness; nay, Elizabeth I saw, more than once, looking at him, not as if she hated, or loathed him---and, when I saw that, the tears came into my eyes. His manner was new to me---he went and sat down, by Sammy Kelly; and, though there was a dead silence; and all eyes were turned upon them; and the spiteful glitter of Sammy's looked like that of the bruised rattle snake; yet he did not appear to observe it. His voice, I thought, was very strange---it produced, I hardly know how to describe it, a tingling, unpleasant titillation, on the drums of my ears---and a kind of echo, in my heart. My father treated him like a man; and, I confess, that I never felt so like a boy, in all my life. When he left us, I sat down, and thought of him---with a feeling of fear; and, it was more than a month, before I could endure to sit in the same chair that he sat in---or even, at the same part of the table. Yet, he would come to me, obtruding himself upon my thought, night and day: and, at last, he came again; when, I began to see into my father's project; or, rather, that of the minister. He had undertaken to give Sammy a companion, in the hope of spiriting him up. It had that effect; Sammy S 2 began to show signs of intelligence, that startled me; but, it was always, except to Hammond, a wicked, mischievous intelligence; nay, such was the incessant activity of Hammond, that he soon led him to play and exercise; and he grew healthy in his appearance; and began to learn his book, heartily. And, one day, (they had grown really attached to each other--a proof to me, then, not of the humanity of either, but of a hellish affinity, in their nature; it will give you some notion of Hammond's strength, and presence of mind;) we were all in the water together. Hammond swam with such prodigious swiftness and force; being, in the shape of his body and limbs, very like a frog---that he made the water foam all over his shoulders. Sammy was with him; and, before we came out, a crowd of boys had gathered about the shore, though we had chosen the place, on account of secrecy; and were hooting at them, and pelting them with dirt, for a couple of sea monsters. I rushed out, like a mad creature, and fell upon them; but the more cowardly Hammond never stirred a limb: and kept playing about, with Sammy at his side, or upon his back, like one long armed ape transporting another, till he was weary and then, he came out; dressed himself leisurely; and helped Sammy into his clothes, taking no notice, whatever, of the boys. But they, profiting by his forbearance, at last turned all their insult upon him. I should'nt have cared a farthing for that—nay, if they had murdered them both, at another time; and on a fitting occasion; but somehow it went against my grain to see my own brother, bitterly as I hated him, so piteously mocked at;—and when they came near him, I interfered. But Hammond stepped before me. “No, master William,” he said,—“I shall take care of your brother. They shan't touch him.” The boys than set up a shout, and renewed the attack. I saw Hammond's eye glance about, rapidly, as if in search of something,—at last, it was rivetted a moment. The next!—heaven only knows, how he got there so soon— his long arms were twined about the neck of the largest boy of the whole; and down, he lugged him to the earth. The others rushed upon him; but Sammy, I declare I began to love the creature for a moment—he flew in among them; squalling, and biting, and scratching; kicking and cuffing; tooth and nail; and I was just putting my hand to the yoke, when lo! the thing was all over— three or four of the boys were caught, and tumbled about, and, as fast as one got up, he was thrown down again—without a blow. It was immeasurably ridiculous—three or four were constantly rolling upon the grass together; and Hammond was straddling about, among them, like some great, strong, gentle, lubberly, good natured beast, amusing itself with pulling and pawing about his enemies. I stood and laughed heartily, when I saw his good natured face; and all the boys joined at last—and the whole affair was quieted without the shedding of one drop of blood. I often thought of it, afterward. I wondered that I could not do it. I remembered how carefully he had handled the boys, as if he were really afraid of hurting them; and laughing every now and then, when he received a blow, just as if it were all in play---but never returning it. “Was the creature a fool?” I said to myself--“undoubtedly” I answered; for, I was sure of it. Having come to this comfortable conclusion---it encouraged me and I went on nourishing my own hateful, irritable disposition. But no---he could not be a fool. No boy talked like Hammond. No boy made such progress in his studies. No boy was so universally loved and laughed at---as Hammond. His strength, too, was prodigious---the greater no doubt, from his education in the woods; for, I have seen him run up a smooth, blasted tree, like some wild animal. And once, I must tell you that, while it is fresh upon my mind. I have already mentioned that the dogs would stop and bark at Sammy, when they saw him. This Hammond soon put a stop to. But, one day, a large dog carried his encroachment a little too far---he bit Sammy. By heaven!---if Hammond did not run down the roof, where he had just gone for a kite,---at the first cry of Sammy---like a wild cat to her young. How he escaped with his neck is wonderful, for I am sure that he did not come more than half way down the spout, (ours is a two story house,) before he leaped upon the dog. The creature rolled over in the mud, as if its vitals were crushed out; and his yelling soon brought the master, a stout boy, from the next door---to his relief. Hammond stopped, and looked at him: and even I--- I trembled at his look. It was calm and settled. The boy did not dare to approach; but contented himself with calling off the dog, and, as soon as he could breathe, provoking him at Hammond. “You had better not, Harry,” said he— But the boy persisted. Hammond crouched down, and watched the dog, with an incessant eye; and hands rapid as light, while it barked and leaped at his face; and at last, sprang at his throat. The next moment, there was a quick yell--Hammond had caught the dog by the throat; then, by the hinder legs—it was quicker than thought—he swung him round, twice or three times; then dashed out his brains—aye, broke his skull into shivers, and spattered his brains out against the pump!—I was terrified. It was all the work of a moment: but it was frightful, to see even an animal, killed so suddenly. So much for his strength and readiness. Now for one example, among hundreds, of his presence of mind. That never deserted him—I have been in a boat with him—in a carriage—in the extremest peril; nothing ever seemed to alarm him. I have known him to start from a sound sleep, at the cry of fire in the room,—or murder; and go as composedly and thoughtfully to work, as if he had been expecting it. But the first case that I remember, was this. It startled me, then; but it has amazed me since, when I have compared the operation of his mind with that of grown men, who are thought instantaneous and electrical. We stood upon a high building, once, together. By a careless tread, I had dislodged a quantity of broken brick and rubbish, from the staging; and saw it falling directly upon the head of a man below, as he was walking by. I reached forward with a cry of horrour—and was just on the point of calling to him, to take care!—when Hammond put his hand over my mouth, and prevented me. I was provoked—but the man escaped. “Why did you prevent me from warning him?” said I—“you wished to see him killed.” “Warning him!—what; when he was going by—as he did, safely—warning him—for what! that he might stop, and look up—and be blinded, certainly, if not killed.” I blushed at my folly. How was this creature, so horribly disproportioned? how was he, forever, in advance of me? I began to hate him bitterly; at last, the more bitterly, because Elizabeth took his part—nay,-- it were a pity to deny it—until I carried my hostility so far, as to abuse him before the whole school—aye, even to spit upon him. Yet, he bore it all—he never struck me. He never even cursed me, in return. At last, sick and weary of my continual persecution, he forbore coming to the house. Elizabeth, I have always thought, was concerned in it; and I had not seen him for a long, long time, until that night, when it is probable that he saved my life; the night, I mean, when I threw myself overboard, with the intention of dying. But I have now come to a more interesting period of my history. I must pass over my childhood. I began to have the feelings of a man. I had forgot Hammond; and had only heard of him, now and then, as remarkably addicted to his books, and very formidable in disputation. I had been away from home, for nearly six years, during which time, some of the adventures, which will be related in the following chapter. happened to me; and, on my return, I found Hammond—not no-not yet—not yet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. Goes abroad...Indigence...Desperation...Series of adventures... Mad house...Prison...Dream...Family of Friends...Caroline ...Reality. During my absence abroad, no matter where, I learnt to look about me with a steady eye, and an assured aspect; to forget all that I had suffered at home; the ten thousand petty and contemptible mortifications, that had drained the fountain of my better feeling, dry, drop by drop; the many substantial wrongs, and smarting insults, that had left me sore and sensitive, all over —literally fulfilling the destiny of him, to whom God hath said—“Go!—go out, from among my people—a wanderer among the nations. Be thy hand lifted against every man; and every man's hand against thee.” Still, there were times, when I would cover my face, and weep, at the recollection of my dear mother and Elizabeth; and almost forgive my father, my uncle, and my brother, the dwarf. My handsome brother—Jeremiah!—is it possible? I have utterly omitted him, in my narrative. Well, well, it is not too late, to say, that he was neither friend nor enemy, of mine. I owe nothing to him, as a brother—nothing. He was a fat-headed, handsome, lubberly boy; with just about brains enough for a retail shop. We were never much together; and, while we were, I do not remember a single incident that ever disturbed me, or him; except, perhaps, when I tumbled his clothes, or soiled his shoes, in my carelessness; for he thought of little, in this world, but eating and drinking—sleeping and dressing. I went abroad—why, I do not feel that any mortal has a right to demand. Enough for me to say, that I stood by the death-bed of a woman—a grown woman— that I had loved—(she was ten years older than I;)— that I saw the black convulsion; the writhing and shivcring of her whole body and limbs—till I grew dizzy and faint; that she gasped out my name—and pointed to the sky. At that moment, there was a total eclipse of the moon—all righteous God!—and the earth shook, just as she had foretold! What wonder that I am afraid of death, when she—the beautiful—the bright—destroyed herself for her love of me; when I saw the foam upon her mouth—the sweat upon her transparent, cold bosom—her white teeth glittering—her parted lips twitching with convulsion—and her eyes all blood-shot!— yet, still she knew me, and loved me; and her eyes were brimful of light and water—and she pointed to the moon—even as I had dreamed, many months before— and the earth actually did shake. I felt it—saw it— and all the people in the house felt it shake, and spoke of it. And there was I—Great God!---Maker of men!— have compassion on me!--was there any delusion, there? O, tell me. How happened it, that both of us had dreamed a dream, so frightfully alike?—both written to each other, when the wide water was between us, at the same time?—and both lived long enough to forget it; and never to remember it again, until we saw its final accomplishment?—a total darkness!—a death-bed! —and an earthquake!—all at the same time? * * * * * * * I had always said—never attempt to prevent her from destroying herself. If she be in earnest, and resolved, you cannot prevent her; and the sooner it is over, the better. On the contrary, if she be not resolved; and only threaten to do it, to frighten me; the surest way to make her do it, is to watch her, and attempt to thwart her;—the surest way to prevent her from doing it, is, to show no concern at all about it. No woman would ever kill herself, if she thought that nobody would be troubled about it. Generally, the threat is only a trick to alarm us; and to get a power over us by that alarm:—but, beware! If you interfere—you put yourself into her power. She repeats the threat, till, at last, she is obliged to attempt the execution of it, to avoid your continual ridicule. And she does make it, finally, in the hope of being prevented at the very last moment—as cowards, after threatening to fight, go into the field, in the hope of being bound over to keep the peace, when they have got there. So reasoned I;—alas, alas!—I did not dream that she was then the desperate, terrible creature that I found her. She died—died almost in my arms; and I left the country. While I was away—it was in a foreign and far land —I was reduced to the most distressing indigence; and, at one time, so fierce and unbending was my nature, that, I stood, late in the evening, upon the border of a river, near where the boatmen used to take in their passengers; and I hesitated whether I should repeat the experiment, that I had once before attempted; and go to—I won't say where—by water; or wait till I was starved into a transparency; or provoke some scoundrel, for numbers were continually prowling about me, to quiet me with his stiletto; or, to take mine, and levy a contribution in my turn. I resolved on the latter— with an unaccountable repugnance, I confess—but, such is the fact; perhaps it may be explained by the difference of countries; and, perhaps, by the difference between stealing from a desk, or an orchard, at home, money and apples—or robbing, abroad, a pocket, or a man. Be that as it may, I was determined not to starve; and, though I shuddered, and the sheath rattled strangely in my hand, when I grappled the dagger in my bosom— the last toy that I had on earth—yet, I deliberately determined. I do not deny it, or palliate it;—it is too late, now, for me to care for consequences. I deliberately resolved, to raise my bread, that night, though it were at the price of blood. It was very dark. The atmosphere was cold and drizzling. The flag-stones slippery. And I was just in the act of leaping upon a man that passed me, when my foot slipped, and I fell;—the sheath flew off, and my hat—and there I lay, stunned by the fall, and grasping the dagger, till I heard a cry of murder!—and the watchman sprang his rattle, at the next square. I had still sense enough left, to know, that, if I were caught in this predicament, it would, probably, go hard with me. I had no stomach for the gallows, just then; anything else in the world, would have been more welcome —the supper of an ostrich; cast iron, and broken glass; or even that of a poet. So, off I set, while, rattle after rattle, was instantly sprung, till the whole city was in an uproar; and, once, I had well nigh consummated the adventure, and prevented—what mortified me, excessively, to think of—the catastrophe of being hanged, when I had not deserved it. A venerable old man—for few others were employed in that city—blind and deaf, for aught that I know—was kind enough to put out his setting pole, and attempt to hook me, as I went by. His lantern saved him; for, as he turned it upon my face, he caught the gleam of the dagger, which I still grasped--- and stood, as if it were already in his heart---luckily for him; for, heaven only knows what I might have done, had he put his hand upon me. This I know, and this only---that I would not have been taken alive, though twenty old men had been the price of my liberty. I set out for food only. It was a mercy, that I did not end with murder. Thus it is, with every man, in the career of vice. It is in vain to stop; your descent quickens, every moment, until you are breathless, and powerless, and bloody. What a beautiful moral! I ran, till I was exhausted; till I could not run another step. I staggered against a wall; and stood in the shadow; and tore open my bosom; while the sweat gushed out of me, as from a sick man, in a steam bath. My hat was gone! Could I have left it behind me?--- and where I fell? The sheath, too!---my name was upon that. The thought was terrible. Ten thousand fearful apparitions came out of the fog and darkness about me, with big heads, and eyes; and stood and nodded at me, till I cried, like a child; leaned against the wall, and cried, and sobbed, with faintness and remorse. I know not what else happened to me. A dreary interval had gone by; and, when I awoke, it was exceedingly dark and cold, about me—a glimmering only could I perceive; and that seemed to me, to come through a grated window, far above me. I arose; I felt round the apartment. It was bare of furniture; and the walls, I could perceive, were of massy stone. My foot T struck something solid. I examined it. It was a huge iron bolt. Where was I? What had happened to me? How long had I been there?—for weeks?—or months? —perhaps, for years? Oh, I could have knelt down, and buried my face in the earth, to hear the sound of any voice, but my own---any sound, but that of my own convulsive sobbing? It was but a little time— so it appeared to me, for a moment—since I had meditated a robbery;—meditated!—gracious heaven!— might it not be? Was not this the fulfilment of my prophesy? Was I not, really, a robber?—a murderer? Who could tell me? Might I not have done the deed? I had been—O, how often!—on the very threshold of it—and might I not? As my thought wandered through all the encompassing thick darkness, my imagination took a vivid and intense delight in torturing me. Who could tell me? Was I not a murderer?—confined?— condemned?—doomed, for ever and ever, to this cell of blackness and desolation? Or—O, I threw myself down upon my knees; and yelled, as if some giant were dislocating my bones. Thick flames arose; and far thunder. Strange shapes rushed in upon me. I was pinioned, hand and foot; rivetted and locked down, to the iron floor. I ground my teeth to dust; and tore my flesh, in my convulsion. Where was I? “Would nobody tell me?—nobody?” I cried. “Nobody!” echoed the wall. I shut my eyes. I lay without breath or motion. Yes, yes. The truth had come at last. It was plain. I was a dead man. I was in the charnel house. Or, had I been buried alive? These were not chains;—they were bands of linen! I heaved and wrestled with them. Yes, it was cloth---cloth, not iron, that bound me. God! how thankful I was!---a noise!--musick!--incense!--warmth! Ha! the sorcerers!---the unhallowed magicians, that do their mysterious working, within the hollow earth;— they had broken upon me! I heard their sweet, terrible incantation. It was like the voice of children.--- Yet. I lay there, breathless and motionless, awaiting the issue. It began to work. Soft hands went, touching, over my forehead, and lips, and eye-lids. The marble dew of dead men gathered, and froze upon me. The green mould of the cemetery, I could feel growing within me. But the charm wrought more potently.--- I could feel the earth stirring under me, and about me; the crumbled population of the sepulchre, assembling their ashes—vitally obedient to the still, delicate summoning; I could hear their gasping and panting—the noise of their knitting joints; but I—O, merciful heaven!—they were turning me into stone. I could feel it! My bones thawing and yielding; my flesh hardening; congealing; petrifying. I could feel it all; at every sob, the thick blood and smoke, oozing from my heart; and fire issuing from my nostrils; my very eye-balls sweating, and discharging their light. Yes, yes!—the frightful curse was accomplished, at last! I had been buried alive---that death, of all others; the fear of which, had haunted me to distraction, during all my life. O, it was insupportable. I grew faint. The lights went out—the vapour. Stars waned, and went by me, shooting. I was all alone; the sky passing away, over my head; my heart filtering yet, like molten iron, through every pore of my flesh, and encrusting my body, as with red-hot armour. I shut my eyes the harder. I felt the work going on. I called upon no mountains to cover me. I determined to endure the process---however terrible it might be, however long---without a murmur. The scorching heat came nearer. I compressed my eye-lids together, till they bled; and there was a hissing then in my brain, as of fire suddenly quenched in blood---or of many serpents, coiling and knotting in flames. I clenched my lips---and lo! the whole place glittered, with incessant and brightly coloured irradiations. I then knew how it was---all, all; and I grew calm, like the great ocean; but, like that, my chest heaved, and heaved, mightily yet, though the tempest had gone by. “Yes, yes,” I cried, after a while, “I am mad.” Well! this had been foretold. But, how long had I been so?---for days, or months, or years? I shivered; and braced myself, with all my thought, as the thought rolled, like a dark river, through my brain; covered with wreck and devastation. I put my hand to my head. I knew it not, by the shape. My temples had sunk. My flesh was cold and sepulchral. The hair was not my hair—it was harsh and wiry; and my heard was thick, coarse, and frightfully rigid. Yes, it was plain, that I had been mad, for many a long year. But, who was I? When did it first happen to me? I was now an old man. At what time, did I cease to be rational? Who was I?—and what?—and where?— There was a time, when I had a home—a sister;—my heart thrilled;—a time when I loved;—my heart grew gentle; and, all at once, it stirred, as in travail. An image of my beloved was born of it—O, how like her! It was hardly bigger than a humming-bird; but every lineament was perfect. I lay yet, with mine eyes shut; and worrying myself, with vain and reiterated attempts, to establish my own identity. What was real, appeared to me a dream;—what might be unreal, wore the countenance of solid marble. But, who was I?— Again, and again, I repeated the question. At last, a little light broke in upon me. I remembered having staggered against a wall; and that, soon after, I saw a gate open; and a man, whom I had long known—a rich man—unmarried, and alone—enter it; that I grasped my dagger, and followed him; that I found myself in his chamber, when it was very dark. Yes, yes!—I remembered all, now. I heard his voice again—saw his eyes roll, even in the dark, with unutterable terrour and brightness. I heard my own voice again, like an echo. It said to the old man—“You are rich—very rich. You have gold with you. I am a desperate man. A little, out of your abundance, will make me happy. Give me. I have no time to lose. Go to your coffers. Give me, till I cry enough. My name is Adams—William Adams. I would not slay you. I give you my name; and, to-morrow, I shall go about my usual occupation. It is one of adventure and peril. If I succeed, I will repay you—with tears of blood; and die at your feet. I shall take no pains to avoid you. You may set the hell hounds of the law upon my track, before the echo of my step has died away in your passages. You may!—but mark me—that game is one of death!—the forfeit is blood! If you can hang me, well; but, if you do not, though you had twenty thousand lives—fathers, and brothers, and children—I would never sleep, nor slumber, until I had wrung out the last drop of black blood, from every heart that bore relationship to you. Give me!—you have heard my terms. Preserve me, and be silent. You are old and worthless—sordid and childless; you will die the easier for being disburthened. What say you? Can you be secret as the grave? Nay, nay—I do not ask your promise. It would be idle to both of us. Your oath! Pshaw! I would not utterly damn you. No;—but I will bind you to me, by a far stronger tie—fear. But utter my name—but breathe it aloud, even in your sleep—and I will, from that moment, wage a war with you, that shall never know a truce, till you are rotting in your grave—or I, upon a gibbet.” He complied; and I had born off the gold. I remembered it all. But, where was the sequel? How came I here? Had he broken the seal? Was I in his power? Or had I—my blood thrilled—it might be, I thought, that I had left the blade of my dagger, at last, in the heart of a living creature. Again, all my arteries were on fire. I felt ten thousand adders coiling about me; crawling over my eye-lids and lips—trailing their slime; the accursed things! And there I was; I—helpless, naked, and left to be crawled over with impunity. Nay, I could feel something—were they worms?—dropping, continually, from the wet ceiling, upon my body. I struggled, and shrieked; but nobody came—nobody; and then I began to remember, more distinctly, who I was. Yes, I was William Adams—indeed I was; and all the dreams of my mother; the maledictions of my kindred; the apprehensions of my sister; all were verified, at last. I was a murderer, in a far country. Many years had happened since—many. I had a distinct recollection of several burning seasons; and several cold, wintry ones, that had gone by, since I was confined. Yes, many a year must have passed. But, whom had I murdered?—and why was I not executed? Ah! the reason was plain—I was mad!—mad!—but where? T 2 I now remembered, how I had been made so. I had been decoyed to a lunatick hospital;—I remembered it well; and the people had been persuaded that I was deranged. I remonstrated. They “humoured me,” and left me. I repeated my remonstrances; assured them, with dignity, that I was not mad; bid them “try me in any way that they pleased.” They shook their heads. “Ask them that know me—my relations.” They looked sadder. I grew reserved. It was a confirmation of their belief. I laughed and talked. “Poor fellow!” they would cry out, with the tears in their eyes—“What a pity!” I would argue with them. They would listen, patiently and piteously, to me; and suffer themselves—curses, ten thousand curses, on their stupidity and compassion!—to be defeated. I would detail my history; my wrongs; aver my own sanity; ask questions, which they would answer kindly to, and go away, and forget; and when I would repeat the tale, till their own eyes ran over, and I had become an object of universal curiosity, they would pity me, and tell how strangely such things ran in my head. Devils! The women, heaven for ever bless them, for it!--they believed me. Their sweet lips would tremble; and their dear eyes would change their colour; and their bosoms would heave, while they listened to me. But they were only women!—what was their judgment? the judgment of nature—nay of God himself, in comparison with my keeper? Yet—I was a lunatick; and, do what I would, it was only a confirmation, in their eyes, of my malady. It was insupportable, I saw how it would end—I became violent—that they called a “breaking out”—and I was put into a straight jacket. I grew melancholy, and passive. This they called subduing me. I reasoned—wrestled in intellect with them— solved problems in geometry; confounded the greatest metaphysicians of the day; dealt with powerful men, that visited me—heaven knows for what purpose— answered all questions, and told for ever the same story, of myself. But all this, instead of proving that I was in my senses, was only a proof of my consummate address and miraculous natural talent. It was impossible that this should continue. I was goaded on—night and day-irritated, and “pitied,” and “indulged,” till I could bear it no longer. Then I became mad, indeed—outrageously mad, as many a stout heart had been before me:—made so, not by God—but by man. Then saw they the difference. I rose in my wrath! I wrenched bars, and bolts, from my prison house—I shook it to its foundation—they assembled about me, with fetters and torture—I leaped upon them, rended and trampled them down--till--I was covered and drenched with their blood. And then! then!—when I had lain down, to sleep—they had fallen upon me, and bound me—yes, yes! I remembered it, well. This was their vengeance. I was now suffering under it. Ha!—where was I. My chains were gone. The darkness and smoke gone—flashes of thin brilliant light broke in upon me—my couch was a gentle one. The serpents and dews, and damp walls—O heaven, and earth!—could it be that I had only been dreaming a dream of unutterable horrour! I had opened my eyes for a moment—but I had shut them again, smarting and blinded with the light.—It grew darker, what! was this only a dream, then? or might I believe—oh, might I, that what I had seen—the white arm—was drawing the curtains? a whisper—ah—I held my breath— again—again!—my touched heart gave out odour and flame, in its gratitude—the thin blood rippled through it again!—God laid his finger upon it, and light issued therefrom. I set up in the bed—I tore open the curtains.— There sat a venerable woman by me—a stranger—with a silver porringer in her hand;—a table by her, covered with labels, and phials; pictures upon the walls, from the Bible; a sweet child, standing on tiptoe, with the door half open. The old lady looked round, with a smile full of benignity,—yet with a dash of terrour. I know not how I appeared. But my thankfulness that it was a dream, gushed, all at once, out of my heart and eyes; and I locked my hands, and fell, with my face upon the pillow.— Something in my manner struck the good lady, I suppose; for she afterward assured me, that she came to me immediately; and that, from that hour—but no—it would be idle to go through all the circumstantial details of my illness and recovery, until I was entirely restored. That good woman watched over me, like a mother. But my dream—O, to this hour, it hath lain here and loaded my heart like destiny—like prophecy. The hair of my flesh rises, when I think of it. I have never dreamed it since—I could not—I am sure that I could not. I should die, in the trial—but, who knows? I am no believer in dreams?—who knows what that may lead to? Men have become mad, with the terrour of madness— and—no, no, have done with this—have done, I say! I soon learnt the truth. I was in the house, at the gate of which I had stopped. The porter had found me: and, by the order of his master, a wealthy and kind hearted man, I had been born to his own house; and nursed by his own wife. For two weeks, I had shown no symptoms of recovery; my life was one uninterrupted delirum; a settled, deep melancholy silence, and stiffened sinews, like one ressisting inward torture; and a fierce, turbulent outbreaking, as of a chained madman, had been the alternations of my disorder. At last, I was well enough, to go abroad. A few days after that, the master of the house, a plain substantial old quaker, came and sat down by me, and addressed me in the following words. “Young man. I am willing to think well of thee.— But there is thy hat (giving it to me)—and there is the sheath of an implement of death, (giving me that, too) which I am sorry to say, was found upon thy person.— Thee assailed a man;—hear me out, if thee please; and lost thy hat, and the other contrivance at the same time. Thee was advertised; and a reward offered for thy apprehension. I went to see the hat and other things, and found by them, what thee was. Thee had come to my house for a refuge. I could not give thee up—Art thee guilty?” I was about to interrupt him--by correcting his phraseology!—yes, reader, at such a moment as that, it so shattered my nerves to hear a man pull and haul (hale) the English language about so shamefully, that I had well nigh given him a lesson in grammar, on the spot! but he went on; and, what is harder to believe—I permitted him to go on. “If thee be guilty—I do not ask thee to own it— there is some money, (putting some into my hand)— go! and peace be with thee; when that is gone, return to me—thee shall have more;—but do not repeat the deed of death. If innocent, and would earn an honest livelihood—tell me who thee art, and what; and I will take thee into my counting house, till something better can be done for thee.” I was thunderstruck----mute, with gratitude, and delight. The benevolent creature! How could it be, that I had never known the true and genuine nature of these plain men. “No,” said I, emphatically---“I assure thee that I am not guilty....thou art somewhat pre—.” He stopped....looked at me, with some little severity; like one, doubting his own senses....“Why, what art thee?” said he--- No wonder that the good man was astonished. I had astonished myself. But so it was,---and so it will be for ever, with all men, when the impressions of childhood are revived in them, unexpectedly. I was born a quaker; partly bred a quaker; lived a quaker, till they had disowned my father, after a series of stubborn wickedness, backsliding and folly, consummated by his marriage; and, to this hour, I never can speak to a friend, but in the natural language of a friend, that of thee and thou; and what wonder? It was my mother tongue. “No,” said I. “I perceive thy astonishment. I have been one of the society. I have been disowned, for transactions, of which, when thou art willing to hear me relate them, I will give thee a plain and true account. I am no murderer; nor, have I a bloody heart. I was nigh starving, however, on the night that this event happened; of which thou hast spoken; and I carried a dagger. I deny nothing. I shall tell the whole, just as it happened. I had no desire to slay any man; I only desired to terrify some one into giving me some pence--no, not pence—I would have dashed him and them to the earth, if he had offered me aught but gold. What! sell my soul for a few paltry farthings—No!—That was all. I threw myself toward him; not upon him; for, my foot slipped; and I fell, leaving my hat and the dagger sheath. What might have happened—by possibility, if he had resisted me, it is horrible to think of—I was very desperate. But my design was not to murder. I ran off, in a paroxysm of terrour; and stopped not, till, overcome with giddiness, delirium, and remorse, I was found at thy threshold. Thou offerest me, generous man, a place in thy counting house. Look at me. Thy confidence will not be misplaced. I am an injured man. I will not wrong thee. I have no testimonial—none to offer thee, of my character, or capability—I can only say—try me. Put me to the proof. Treat me boldly. Put confidence enough in me to ruin thee, if I am false; or thou wilt never truly know of what I am capable. When I had finished, I was amazed to find myself standing up; the good man holding both of my hands, and looking me in the eyes; just as a father would look into the eyes of a prodigal son. His wife sat by him, rocking, too and fro, in a great arm chair, with her handkerchief to her face; and, her gray silk gown rustling, like the autumnal forest, in a still breeze; and little Caroline was there too, clinging to her father's side, and gazing upon me, with such innocent, unaffected delight, that I could have fallen upon her neck, and kissed her breath away. I have already mentioned a strange dream that I had, when I was quite a boy. The very first night that I slept in the house provided for me by Mr. Austen, (the quaker, whom I have just mentioned) after our conversation, I had the same dream again. But, before I relate what I am about to, let me mention, what, I dare say all have experienced, in some degree, at some time, in relation to dreams—that, many things, of which I know not the use, or the name; and, more particularly, articles of costly furniture, that I had seen in my dream, I had afterward met with, one by one; and learnt the name, and use of; and that, I have been often startled, and provoked too—by some resemblances to the old mansion;—the great pictures—and the frightful disorder of the whole house; as if the family had all been broken up, at midnight—which I met with, sometimes, in my travelling, for a single moment, in my after life. I ought not to forget, too, that, when I first read about Pompeii and Herculaneum, and the appearance of the houses there, that I was very forcibly struck with the coincidence between it, and what I had seen in my dream; so much so, indeed, that I could not be satisfied, till I had got hold of a particular description of Pompeii, and of the excavations there; and seen drawings of the houses. But then I was easy. The great house that I had seen, was not at all like their houses. Nor, was it like the picture of any palaces, or publick buildings, that I had often seen. It was different from all, and any that I had ever read of, or formed any notion of; and yet, there was nothing remarkable in it. It was only a large, noble looking mansion, such as a gentleman of good fortune, would be likely to build for himself—and it had, withal, a little of a foreign air, which struck me, instantly. Well—at last, I dreamed of it again—why, I knew not; for, I am certain, that I had not thought of it, or of my dream, for ten or a dozen years. But now, it was a little varied. I was in the same house. I knew it, immediately. But somebody had been there, since I was. The rich old furniture was entirely gone, from some of the apartments; and other of a homelier fashion, had been substituted, in two or three of them. The great pictures were gone. The candlesticks, lamps, and wine glasses were all gone. But, there was the stain upon the great marble slab, at the head of the first flight of stairs, where the lamp had fallen.—Reader—believe me—whoever you are—believe me—I am telling you the simple, plain truth, whatever you may think of it. It is a truth, too amazing to be told, to the world, in any other way—and yet. I never shall be easy, till I have told it. I do not want the courage to tell it, and to swear to it—for, there are people, or were, a little time ago, who had heard me tell my dream, many years before the event took place, of which I am soon to speak—but, who would believe me, if I did? Nobody. I put it in this shape, therefore, that people may do as they please, about believing me. Yet, nevertheless, as I hope to see my Maker, face to face, that is true. To return, then. The dust had been carefully brushed away from the walls—the great crimson curtains aired—it was evident that somebody had been there. Yet, why were the windows all closed—and left too, without being bolted, or barred? Why was the door only shut, without being fastened? And why was it yet uninhabited? not a dog—nor a cat—no living creature—not even a fly nor a spider could I see. I stamped—the noise came back to me, in a hollow, dead echo. I shouted—several times—with a loud voice; but, no answer could I hear—nothing, that sounded, as if I were not alone. At last, I was weary of it, and came away; but, in returning, I passed the door of a handsome room, which I had forgotten to explore, at this, my second visit. I remembered that, when I was there before, I had descended into it, by three small steps. I pushed it open; and, finding the whole singularly light and cheerful. I bounded into it, with an explanation of astonishment, holding my hat in my hand—my hair wet with perspiration, from having been so long in the sultry, confined air, of the other apartments. I was standing, I remember, a little edgewise, toward a side of the room, where there was a very large, handsome cabinet—and trying to recollect, what kind of furniture had been there before; but, while I was doing so, something moved at the other end of the room. It was broad day-light, and my heart was in my throat, instantly; and, before I turned my head, a flash of light followed; as if something, in a brilliant white drapery, had passed by a large mirror, that I was looking into. I turned; and beheld a fine looking girl, with fair hair, and agreeable eyes, watching me, with an air of perfect indifference. She sat leaning back in a large chair, at the further end of the room. I attempted an apology; but, the words all stuck in my throat. I could neither speak nor breathe, nor swallow; and, I remember, distinctly, her appearance, when I approached her; bowing, blushing and stammering out a sort of excuse, that I had been there before, and believed the house to be uninhabited. She wore a thin, blue-striped muslin dress; a sort of morning gown—open before, and high in the neck; but so very thin, as to show her fine bosom; and, particularly, her right breast, which was surprisingly beautiful, and natural—unsustained by any corset or stays, almost as if it had been naked. I hardly know what followed in my dream, until I awoke; except that she accounted for the lonely, and exposed situation, and appearance of the house, by mentioning that a woman, her mother, I believe, was mad—and confined in a remote apartment; but, when I did awake, I found myself lying on the floor of my room—excessively sore, all over—even to the roots of my hair---as if I had taken a violent cold. I went to bed again; but, I got no more sleep that night. The old dream was revived; and, I began to be troubled about it---and determined to do something---what, I knew not. The next day I told it---carelessly, to Hezekiah---but, he only laughed at me; and, I soon forgot it. Still, however, I would have you bear it in mind. From that hour, I was like one of the family. A whole year passed away, like a dream to me; the most tranquil dreaming too, of all my life. I stood high, beyond all rivalry, in the estimation of the whole household. I had even began to think somewhat seriously about returning to the faith. Why? Let Caroline answer that question. She was a child—a sweet, simple, caressing, innocent child; yet, such was the influence of her affectionate young heart, over my stubborn and proud spirit, that I—I wish that I had not begun this tale;—but, it must be told, now. It is too late to repent. At last, one evening, as we sat together, about the fire; the mother working a rug; and Caroline reading aloud—her short, loose hair, hanging all about her eyes —(she read charmingly)---the good old Hezekiah, in his quiet way, reminded me of my promise, to tell him my history; adding, that, if it were painful to me, I was discharged from it; if there were aught, that I would U have forgotten---“why, forget it,” said he; “and tell me, William,” he continued, significantly, “only what would be proper, for my wife and child to hear.” I began the story. I told all that had happened to me, substantially, as I have related it here; all, except the particulars of my squabbling, and my love; the first, on my own account---the latter, on Caroline's; for twice, when I touched upon the name of Lydia, and another, inadvertently, and faltered; I saw her red lips tremble, and her eyes turn, with a quick, uneasy expression, upon the book. Then, she would throw it down; and take up her work. Then, she sewed wrong---ripped it out--- and sewed it worse; clipped her finger, with the scissors, and ran a needle into it, up to the very joint. Her mother saw it, as I continued; and, finally, bade her put by her work, and read a chapter in the Bible. Her voice was a gentle, clear harmony; and, when she read aloud, from that book, it was like the sweet wisdom of a cherub; dropping, seriously, from the lips of children. It made my heart better to hear her read. The sweet, plaintive, affectionate, expostulating tone; the simple, clear undulation of sound; the perfect pronunciation; and the ever changing cadence---from command, to entreaty---from supplication, to complaint---kept all my senses alive, while Caroline was reading the Bible. “Farewell!” said the father, after a short, but plain and fervent prayer---“farewell, my children!”---and then we all broke up; and, after shaking hands, went to our apartments. I remember, that Caroline's hand, when I took it, was passive and timid, that night, for the first time. “Have I offended her?” said I, to myself. The mere thought of such a thing, humbled and pained me. I determined to know the cause; but she would give me no opportunity. I never saw her so assiduous, in my life. I tried to catch her eyes; but I could not. Young as she was, I dared not speak to her; nor lay my hand upon her, as if by accident, from that time forth. We met again; and I renewed the tale, as it is related in the following chapter, without having had an opportunity to look once, for a whole week, into her young eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. Quakers...Friends....Discipline....Forbearance...Reasoning... Marriage ceremonies...Caroline...False English of the Friends ...Reprobation of musick and dancing...Presumption and impiety...Reproof of a speaker...Pronunciation...Examples. I was born, as I have told you, of a quaker family; and, so far as I was permitted to think for myself---or, to become acquainted with two or three other quaker families, who used to visit my father, after he was turned out---I was rather pleased, than otherwise, with their ceremonies and discipline; saving and excepting their language, dress, and prohibition of amusement, until I was old enough to think for myself. I then---heterodox wretch that I was---some how or other, got it into my head---notwithstanding all their persuasion, to remain steadfast to their faith---that it was very ridiculous to wear a plain dress, generation after generation, as a matter of religion; a dress, too, that, when adopted, was the court dress of the time. I went further. I even began to imagine, that spiritual pride might, possibly, (for I was in some doubt, a long while,) be as offensive to the Deity, as any other sort of pride, whatever. I learnt to look about me. I found that the friends, whom I knew, wore the very best of woollen, and linen, and silk; and that, in their way, they were quite as dressy, and fashionable, as other people; nay, as proud.[6] [6] Their argument is—that their dress gives them no trouble; that it is a matter of economy; and necessary to distinguish them, as a peculiar people. I deny all this. It does give them great trouble. How are they to get a quaker dress made, among a strange people; in France, or Germany—or even in some parts of America? Only by supervising and directing the whole detail. What could a coxcomb do more? I say that they are exceedingly particular and careful; and rather more so, than any other people in the world, of that very dress, which they affect to regard as a matter of indifference. A man of plain, good sense, without any such pride—sectarian pride—would give himself no trouble about his dress, let him go where he might. He would conform to the age of the people; taking care not to be ridiculous, (for singularity in dress will always be ridiculous, and childish, in a greater or less degree,) either by being excessively in the fashion, or excessively out of it. But, is it more economical? Certainly not more so, than the same colours, worn in any other fashion; for the quakers cannot, and do not, wear their coats longer than other men, in the same circumstances of life—except that the quakers are more sober and careful of their clothes; and might wear any kind longer than most people. And why should they be distinguished as a peculiar people? Do they want their Divine Master to know them? Or, do they want man to know them? Is it to be laughed at?—and mocked at? No—that time has gone by. Is it that they may know each other? No—for a genuine quaker would be known to his brethren, immediately, however he might be dressed; and ought to be known by his action, not by his dress; by his devout, innocent simplicity, and plainness of heart, not of dress. Well, then, what is it but this—a quaker garb?—what is it but going about, with a label upon their foreheads—crying out, continually—Lo! we are a humbler, and quieter people, than ye; a more godly people; more zealous of good works—(or good workmanship—which is true;)—that have prevailed against all persecution, until our very dress, which was once a reproach, and a byword, among you, has become an uniform—a banner—and a trophy of distinction? Pshaw!—such is the plain truth. Beside, how contradictory are they, in precept and example? They say—we do not regard dress—it is a matter of indifference. Then, why so particular, themselves; and why so obstinate and perverse, in withstanding all the changes among man?—why so strict to mark iniquity, in the dress of their young? Why do they continually cry out—“By their fruit ye shall know them,” when a gay quaker; or a hickory quaker, goes before them. One word of advice to the quakers. They will soon become extinct;—even in Pennsylvania. They will soon become incorporate with the world. There is only one thing that can prevent this. It is a rational yielding—a temperate indulgence. They are half a century behind the spirit of the age. Young people, now, require indulgencies and inventions, that their fathers never dreamt of. Not that I would have them let loose upon society, without any restraint; but I would have them taught to speak English—and to accomplish their bodies and minds, in every healthful, manly, and elegant acquirement; till, to be a quaker, was no longer to be a desperate young colt—ignorant and wild; or an obstinate old man, of pretty good sense—great selfishness—avarice—and worldly wisdom—with a severe quiet outside.—Ed. As a matter of religion, therefore, I soon learnt to laugh at dress. I went a step higher. They did not swear---that was well; but they would not take an oath in a court of justice. The reason of that, was not so evident to me.--- Still, as there was nothing absolutely wrong, or very foolish, in such tenderness of conscience, I let that pass. I found no drunkards; no scoundrels---(scoundrels, I mean, that have been convicted in a court of justice;)--- no downright, bare faced liars, nor thieves, among them. How was that? I'll tell you. When a man got drunk; or stole; or lied; and was caught---for much depended on that---they turned him out, neck and heels, from among them. Hence, they had no paupers. Certain vices lead to poverty. This people take care to prevent that, by watching the earliest indication of the vice; and turning the transgressor out from among them.” “That was politick;—wiser, it may be, than reformation, or remonstrance;” said I, in the same tone of voice. “William!” said Caroline, timidly. I dared not look her in the face. I was wrong. I felt that I was. My indignation was carrying me, astray. I was obliged to confess that the friends, as a religious society, are remarkable, beyond all others, for their patience, and mildness, and compassionate forbearance, toward the backsliding. I, myself, had experienced it. Caroline put her little hand to her eyes—and I continued; while Hezekiah sat, with his broad, greasy beaver, pulled over his forehead, smiling, with the old fashioned benignity of one, who cannot bring himself to chide a petulant boy, at every moment of his folly; and Eunice, his good wife—a speaker among the friends— only took off her spectacles; wiped them with her dark brown bandanna handkerchief; smoothed her grey poplin gown; and shook her head, placidly. I proceeded. “I did not like their mode of marrying. Why, I can hardly tell. It was surely wiser, and might be more solemn, either as a civil or religious contract; it led to greater circumspection; and put to trial the sincerity— the fortitude of all:—but then, I had seen that, frightened as the women generally were, when they stood up, to undergo the ceremony—that the men were always— yes, always—more frightened than the women. This, I thought, unlucky; it was letting out the nature of the woman, too publickly.” Hezekiah smiled; and Caroline's mouth. I would swear, (if I were not a quaker,) puckered a little. U 2 “And once, I remember,” said I, “when two fools—I beg your pardon—were standing up to be married[7] [7] Tautology—pleonasm. Ed. .— I was there, and kept my eyes upon them; they had let go of each others hands, in rising; or, had forgotten to take hold of them; and when they were up, and repeating the word, “I A. B. take thee C. D. to be my lawful wife; and promise through divine assistance,” &amp;c.— they were poking all the while, like two blind people, after each others hands—standing almost back to back; and had really completed the ceremony, before they succeeded at all. Nay, aunt Eunice—don't be angry with me—it is very true, and Caroline—thee need'nt laugh—it may be thee Tate one of these days.” Poor Caroline coloured up to the eyes--her work fell; and, in picking it up, she set her beautiful hair on fire; and, in putting that out, scorched her fingers. “Why, Liny, dear, what ails thee?”--said her father, jumping up, and smoothing down her hair, over her glittering dear forehead. “Go on William, go on— never mind the child—why, I declare, thee looks more frightened than she—well done!” Down went the candle—and we were left for a moment, in absolute darkness. I attempted to find it; and, in doing so, I encountered a soft hand—ah, heaven!—ere I could withdraw it—I felt the pressure of a warm trembling mouth upon it—I was strangely affected---strangely. The sweet innocent—could it be? I had no time to reflect on the matter, for a light appeared; and I resumed my story, trembling, however, and so pale, that it was observed. I glanced at Caroline. She had pulled her little chair behind her mother; and sat, so, that I could see nothing of her face, but a bright line along her profile—I never saw her so intently busy. —I went on. “Their language---it is detestable. They affect to speak pure English. It is shamefully wrong. They will not say you are, to an individual, because some Roman Cæsar chose to be so addressed. This would be well. I could venerate such great simplicity. But— what do they substitute? Not thou art; for that were beautiful, so beautiful, that I would never use any other language, if I did not think it too beautiful; too holy, and too tender; for any other use, than, in our prayer to the Deity; and in our communion with them that we love—in passion; in poetry; and, most of all, in the deep, deep devotion of the heart.” There was a silence like death in our little parlour— I could hear Caroline breathe, like one asleep and happy. “No!—but what do you substitue?—a base counterfeit jargon, that is neither one thing nor another—saying thee is, and thee art, very often; and, generally, pronouncing the possessive pronoun thy as if it were written thee—as thus—“How's thee wife,” for how is thy wife. Such shocking barbarism ought to be done with. Speak as you will; but, in the name of all that is decent and respectable, speak some language or other. Don't talk quaker, as if you were ashamed of it. You value yourselves on rejecting the idle, frivolous accomplishments of the age, in which you act most wisely; and in teaching your children only what is plain and substantial. Yet what is the consequence?—this adulterate language is common among your best educated men and women. Shame on you. Either have more courage, or less presumption;—more regard to the rules of grammar, and common sense, or less ridiculous tenderness about the Roman Cæsars. Either say you are; or thou art, and you will cease to be ridiculous, however peculiar may be your dialect. It will be then like your dress, if you choose the latter; but far more respectable and dignified; now, it is as if you should invent something of your own, unlike the garb of any other people, savage or civilized. Your funerals. They are well. I like to see men and women, put into the ground like cats and dogs;—in white deal coffins, to be sure, but without ceremony.— Nay, Hezekiah, I will not be reproved. Your society have carried their spirit of contradiction to a childish, ridiculous extent. They omit all titles—because others use them—they say yes and no; and give as a reason, that, in the scripture they are bidden to say yea and nay! But why do they not say yea and nay, then? and why, if they are so conscientious, do they not confine themselves to the original Greek. He, whom they follow, did not forbid either: nor did he talk English. How do they know, then, that they are obeying him? They bury in while coffins, because other people bury in black ones. They wear no mourning. That is well. Yet, some sign might be worn, to apprise people, when they meet you, that you have lost a friend, lest they may distress themselves; if they do not distress you, by an abrupt inquiry after the health of your dead wife or child? I do confess, that, to my ears, it is very disagreeable to hear a little broadbrim, just in jacket and trowsers—addressing a man of thy age, by the name of Hezekiah. It touches mournfully, and unpleasantly along my heart, where I have happened—unapprised by any badge, even the simplest—of a death, to speak of some one, that was very dear to—I beg your pardon again. It is only the other evening, you remember, that you, yourself, were led to inquire after the health of a woman, who had been buried but a week before—of her own husband, too!—a man of sensibility, that had loved his wife, as we all know—like a heretick, with all his heart and all his soul. Had he worn any badge, I care not what-something that would tell, not of his sorrow; but something that would warn me not to tread, too suddenly, upon the fresh grave of a beloved one—he had been spared that pang. They prohibit dancing; musick--painting, perhaps; and sculpture. That is bigotry, not religion. It is the abuse of these things, that should be reprobated; not the things themselves. They worship in a manner, that would be awful, were only the old or the truly good assembled together. But, as that can never happen, they have adopted, just exactly the worst mode of worship in the world for a mixed congregation of men and women, young and old, devout and careless. I know this. That mind must be capable of an abstraction, approaching sublimity, which can maintain her intercourse, in silence, with Jehovah, for two whole hours at a sitting; and that too, interrupted by an eternal shuffling of feet; blowing of noses; hemming, and hawing, and spitting, for the last half hour, as the junior population—of hearers—begin to manifest their impatience, and to hint their desire of an adjournment.” “No—it is impossible. He who would wait upon his Maker, with a broken and contrite spirit, must be content, either to worship him alone, in the mountain, where “the man of sorrows” went, in the solitude of his spirit; or, with his own family, and for a shorter time; or, if with others, at the risk of being driven, at the mercy of all his corporeal senses, over all heaven and earth. The senses must be well employed, or they will be badly employed. They will not be idle; and, where they have no employment—they have no repose; where there is no musick; no form; nothing but a cold, august, unaccountable silence, they will work themselves out of the place, and go abroad, vehemently.” “But, worst of all, ten thousand times worse, is their tremendous impiety. They would teach that the age of miracles hath passed. Yet, they would affect to work a continual miracle. The times of the Galileans and the fishermen are not our times; yet, these men would persuade us that ignorance and stupidity are no hindrance, in our day, to the propagation of doctrines, that concern our everlasting happiness. Nay, they pretend daily,---the least presumptuous of them---to a more intimate communion with God, than any of the apostles did;—they come into his temple;—they feel the outpouring of his grace....and power....and they arise....full of the divinity....and talk over, again and again, such intolerable nonsense, as we should blush to hear, from any ordinary man, in the ordinary concerns of life. Yet this—this everlasting repetition; sing song; and cant; without scope or object, argument or inference; every word of which, after a little time, may be anticipated, from the running, favourite language and manner of the speaker, with as much certainty, as if they were written down, and never altered, except in their arrangement----this is called inspiration----the prompting of Divinity. Father of mercies!---do these men know what they are saying!---they the organs of thy will!---they!—O, if they really believed it, would they not quake and fall down?---would they not tremble in their joints?---would they not fall upon their faces, and pray that the cup might pass from them? Inspiration! it is babbling stupidity; for which their dishonoured Maker, if he had aught of human infirmity in his nature, would silence them, for ever---blind and darken them, for ever, for daring, in their terrifick presumption, to ascribe such wretched blasphemy to his prompting.” “William! William!—what art thou?”—cried the alarmed and trembling mother—as she stood before me, moving her articulate hands, and outstretched arms, up and down, as if to conjure some evil spirit, down into the earth again. “No, mother, no—” I cried, standing boldly upon my feet, before her—“No! I venerate thee—I love thee —as if thou wert really my own mother. I know that thou art sincere—I have seen thee, pale as death; and heard thy prayer, like strange musick, in my heart, long and long before thou didst dare to arise, and give it utterance; there are others, too—men of great minds, and women of pure hearts—but, ye are all presumptuous, infatuated creatures. Teach us, if you will. But first qualify yourselves. What!—will ye break to us, the bread of eternal life, without first having learnt whether ye have the power?—when, you do not even call your children about you, to teach them their alphabet, till you, yourselves have learnt it, as other people have learnt theirs. Are you inspired? Why are not your children? Is the miraculous communion of God with his creatures yet known? Then why have you not the gift of tongues? Why do you learn languages? Why not trust to inspiration for them?—and, literally, taking no heed what ye shall say, go abroad among the nations of the earth, warning and denouncing, each in their own language?” The good woman could endure this no longer. She fell upon my neck, and wept aloud; and Caroline too, I could see her little heart sobbing, in the corner. “Oh William! William!”—cried the former, as soon as she could speak—“would that thou mightest feel, with one half the enthusiasm, with which thou speakest! Thou wouldst then be, even in thy errour—what I cannot, dare not believe thee to be now—though I do hope it—a good man. But, let me not judge thee. We are all frail, fallible creatures. There is only one Being, to try the reins of men. It may be, that we are all wrong....it may even be, that thou art right....but, dear William, I do entreat thee—take heed to thy steps. Thou art young, and of a brave heart; going about among the children of men, with an undaunted countenance; but, oh William! William! my dear child! there is One that can bring thee low; One that may, if thou art not turned aside, by some lighter calamity, lay his hand upon thee.” “Ah, William, I do love thee, even as my own child. I am old, and have not long to live. It would make me happy, to find thee less showy---less eloquent---more simple and direct, in these matters. I hope that I do not judge of thee, uncharitably; but, it doth appear to me, that thy nature is---I have long thought so, but till this night, I have been unwilling to tell thee so---is rather to talk about religion, than to feel it; rather to agitate others, than to be agitated thyself, with the name of the living God.” I was unaccountably affected at her reproof. I hung my head. I could find no answer to her words. I returned her embrace. “Mother!” said I---“thou shalt be my mother---henceforth, I will talk less loudly.” “Oh, bless him!” I heard some one whisper, near me. I knew the voice. It went, into the holiest, sweetest place of my whole heart. There followed a silence of some minutes---and Caroline sat, with her head leaning away from us; and, I thought, from a convulsive heaving of her shoulders, now and then, that she was weeping. “Go on---” said Hezekiah, mildly, “and confine thyself to the story---if possible.” “Well,” said I, at last, “I left my native town, for awhile, with no more notion of religion, than of the black art. I rambled, hither and thither, without having an opportunity to meet with any of the society, or to understand their discipline. At last, I happened, in my journeying, to tarry awhile, where I was willing to take advantage of my quakership; at least, so far as to escape militia service.” “Was that thy only indoosement?” said Hezekiah. “Ind-yuse-ment;—allow me,” said I; willing, if I could not correct the father, whose organs were inapt and rigid, to give Caroline a lesson, over his back. “Well, then—no matter how it is pronounced; thee understands me, and that is enough.” “Pardon me,” I replied, “that is not enough. There is a right way, and a wrong way. And it is always worth our while, whatever we do, to do it right.” “But it is a matter so trivial,” said Eunice, mildly; and Caroline, too, was about to speak—but the sound died away on her lips; and she turned up her bashful eyes to me, with such an air of entreaty, that I would have forborn, if I could; but I could not. There were certain sounds, in pronunciation, that jarred upon my ear, like false notes, in musick. “Trivial!” said I. “Can that be trivial, which is of perpetual application, every moment of our lives?—that, which is almost the only distinguishing trait now, between the language of the well born, and well educated, and the vulgar?—that, which gives delicacy and charm to the chiefest pleasure of life—social conversation?— Oh, no! Let me ask you. Are you not among the first to remark the strong vulgarities, and provincialisms, of the Irish, and Scotch? Do I not often hear you all, kind hearted as you are, repeat, with a tone of pity, (and shame, sometimes,) the words that you have heard others pronounce badly, or misapply? Nay, is there anything, that more disturbs your attention; or more diminishes your respect for any person, than downright vulgarism?” “All acknowledge that there is not. But, we all have our own vulgarisms; and that we have, it never enters our head to conceive, until we have been thrown among strangers; who, though not less charitable; nor more fastidious than our friends, cannot forbear testifying their surprise, when we fall into them. We are startled then, and led to examine for ourselves. How are we mortified, to find, that we have been using words all our life, that are not to be found in our language? Coinage of our own limited neighbourhood; cant words of our own village, town, city, or province? We are humbled; not much, to be sure, if we regard a delicate nicety on such subjects, as trivial; yet somewhat—for our cheeks will redden, if, while we are talking to a stranger, we see that he does not rightly understand us.” “Trivial! Nothing is trivial, which has a right, and a wrong, in it; nothing is trivial, which is of constant, hourly use, in the sweetest communion of life—the musick of conversation—the harmonies of the fire-side.— Indeed, indeed, the time is coming, when many things, that are now common among us, will be denounced, as unqualified vulgarity and barbarism. I have often hurt your feelings, my dear sir—Hezekiah, I mean—and yours, Caroline; but, depend upon it, that it was never intentional; that my own have been lacerated more cruelly at the time, and bled longer afterward; but I know, and feel, that the time will come, when they, whom I have most frequently pained, for a moment, will thank me for it. Why are they mortified? Is it that they really think the matter trivial? No!—their eyes and cheeks give a flat contradiction to their words. They are ashamed and angry, with themselves, and with me. They act as if they were infallible. They cannot bear to find another wiser than themselves; as if it were any reproach, to be ignorant of what we never were taught. Their looks prove, that they do not regard the matter as trivial. If they did, they would'nt be disturbed. Would their eyes sparkle, and their lips quiver, if I should tell them, that one bead more was necessary, to a string of coral, upon their necks? No. That would be trivial. But, if I told them that they did not keep time in dancing, or that they read through their noses, then it is ten to one, that their eyes would flash fire, and their beautiful forms dilate with petulance—while some of them W would tell me, snappishly enough, too, that they “could not see the use of such pedantry”—or, that “it was time wasted.” “Pedantry, to speak correctly! Trivial, to pronounce so, that the ear drinks in your modulation; and the understanding the sense thereof, like melody, and poetry; without jarring, crash, or discord.” “Suppose that you should hear a woman say, virtoo, or vartue, or sarvant? Would it not be unpleasant to your ear? Would not your attention to what she was saying, be disturbed?—and would you not be among the first to speak of her vulgarity, afterward—with compassion, I admit—but calling it vulgarity, nevertheless? Yet, to a well trained ear, there are many faults in your pronunciation, far more shocking.” “What are they, William?” said the mother. “Tell us now, while we are prepared for it. I have often desired some such opportunity for a dispassionate discussion of the subject; and I hope some advantage from it; much as I lament thy evil habit of correcting every body—” “Pardon me, mother—not every body;” said I. She continued, with a pleasant tone—“Old and young; friends, acquaintances, and strangers. It is really a bad habit, William; one that, apart from an appearance of pedantry, and indelicacy, if not of a want of feeling, (which appears to be in it,) is liable to a more serious charge—to that of pride and self-conceit.” “O, no—you do me injustice, indeed. I have no such feeling. Do I attempt to obtrude my authority upon you? Never. Do I give laws and rules of my own, to regulate you? No. Do I even lay down acknowledged principles, if they are arbitrary, without lamenting and acknowledging that they are so? Believe me, mother—if nobody, but myself, were ever to hear Caroline pronounce a word wrong, I should care little for it; right or wrong, whatever she said, would be pleasant to me.” “William!” said the father, seriously—with the accent of reproof; and glancing at poor Caroline. “But, she will be among others, men and women, who are becoming more and more scrupulous, every day; and then it would pain me—I cannot deny it—to the heart, to hear her transgressing. A well bred woman, or a well bred man, will so speak the English language; or the French; or any language, if he can, that you will be unable to say, when you hear the former, while he speaks, whether he is Scotch, or Irish; or Welsh, or English;—or whether the latter, when he talks French, be a Gascon, Norman, or Parisian. It is hardly a less degree of vulgarity, to be marked by nationalisms, than by provincialisms, or cockneyisms. For my own part, I would as soon submit to talk the dialect of a Yorkshireman, or Lancasterman, or Bow-bell-man, in London; a Canadian, or Yankee, or Virginian, in America; or Arragonese, in Spain; or anything, but the pure Castilian, there; and the Tuscan, in Italy; or the Hoch Deutsch, in Germany; as to speak either Scotch, Irish, Welch, or American, so as to be known, at once, for one of either people. No— let us so talk the English language, that people will love to hear us, even when they do not understand us; let us adopt a standard, and follow it.” “I have hurt your feeling, I know, by my interruptions, now and then. I know that it is unseasonable to arrest one, in the flow of his heart, to tell him of some errour in his pronunciation; and, I confess, too, if he be very correct, that it would be well to wait till he is done.[8] [8] And yet, then is the time. Would'nt you tell a fellow, that his pumps were split open—or a lady, that her hair was coming off,—in the middle of a dance? I would; for, on more than one occasion, I have seen strange accidents happen—even with frocks and petticoats, in a ball room—to say nothing of garters, and false curls, and gaping slips, and smutty faces—for want of a little timely intimation.—Ed. But, how am I to remember all his blunders? It is impossible. I must either correct him on the spot, then, or not at all. Perhaps, he will get angry. In ninety-nine times, out of one hundred, he does. I confess, that it is provoking. But why? Let him search his own heart. It is vanity. His self love is wounded. He would claim to be infallible. Bless his heart; or, rather, bless her heart; for I have a woman in my mind now—who blunders incessantly; and calls it pedantry, to speak without blundering;—a little reflection would put that at rest, for ever. Year after year, have I already spent in correcting myself; yet, there is not a day of my life, hardly, wherein I do not find that I have been wrong, ever since I could speak; using some word that was not English; or—what is to the full as bad— mis-pronouncing a word, that is English. And shall she, who is set right only now and then, start and thrill, as if her honour were impeached, because I hint to her that such a word is not English; or that the accent should have been placed on another syllable? I do it, to protect her from future mortification. How will she ever know that she is wrong, unless somebody tell her of it? She never thinks of looking into a dictionary at all; and I never do, unless to satisfy myself, for a moment. It is only, when I hear a word pronounced in a new way, that I run to it; rather in the expectation of finding that I am right, than wrong. Thus, it is only last Sunday, that I heard a well educated man, after pronouncing, at least, one hundred words wrong, pronounce two, in a manner so very uncommon, that it startled me. He said te-nure, instead of ten-ure, giving the e the sound that it has in the—and sombre, giving the o that sound, which it has in old. I had always given the two letters the sound of e, in met—and o, in lot; and, not an hour ago, I learnt that ad-ult, is a-dult. There is no practice like reading aloud, to correct our pronunciation. We are startled, when we come to a new word, then; but, if we are reading to ourselves, as few of us pronounce the words, then, we pass over them. You may commit Johnson's folio to memory; and yet, be less accurate when you are through; and far less prompt, than by reading a few pages aloud, even to yourself, every day or two, for a few months, with a dictionary at your elbow.” “Depend upon it, that we are getting into a fashion, of greater nicety and neatness, in our language. Men are as much ashamed now; or will be, soon, of a slovenly pronunciation—and women, of a sluttish one—as of nastiness and vulgarity, in their dress, or writing.— Nay, I will go further. I do say, that it shocks a well educated ear, as grievously, to hear a word mis-pronounced, as it does your eyes, to see it mis-spelt. And, I have no doubt, that, before our country is five years older, orthography and pronunciation will be classed together; and that a woman will as soon discard her lover for false pronunciation, as for false spelling; nay, that men will learn to blush at the former, in the tenderest tête à tête, as at the latter, in the sweetest billet doux—(pardon my French.) They will blush to look at one; and to think of the other. Nay, a few years ago, it would have been thought as pedantick, for one to correct another; a lady, in false orthography, however truly he respected her; as it would be, now, to correct her pronunciation. Then, it would have been held trivial, I dare say; and beneath the attention of a sensible man, to tell a girl, that he loved, how to spell. His dear one might have written character with two k's, (for I have known such a case,) with impunity; and, even now, she may pronounce strength, strenth; frequently, frekwently; perfume, purfume; going, goin; doing, doin. &amp;c. and nobody shall dare to hint an amendment. Believe me, the time is not far off, when people will wonder at our present forbearance toward such vulgarity, as we now wonder at that of our ancestors, toward false orthography.” “Well, William, it is getting late; and we have heard nothin yet of thy history. Suppose—” “Nothing, if you please,” said I. “Well then, nothing. Suppose that we postpone that matter for to-night; and, to-morrow evening, take it up agane?” “Agen,” said I, “to rhyme with men.” “To-morrow is first day,” said his wife. “Yes,” said I, laughing; “and the day called Monday, is the second day. That is another of your whims; it is beneath the name of principle. Why break in upon the customs of society, with new names, for every day, and every month? You might as well (for the reasons are the same) invent a new language at once; or, W 2 like the Jews, have a peculiar Sabbath. You refuse to say Sunday, Monday; and January and February; because Pagans and Idolaters did so:—but the same objection would hold to our language; and, certainly, to the Latin;—that was spoken by Pagans and Idolaters; and all the modern languages—ours, with the rest—are greatly indebted to it.” “Really, William, it is diverting to hear thee. What possesses thee?” cried the old man. “Thee has gone all round the compass. Is there anythin' wrong there?” “Why not ask him,” added his wife, smoothing the venerable hair upon his ruddy temples, with her hand, “if there be anything right in it. William is a terrible critick.” “Nothing but thee has,” said I; “nothing else, that I can see. But that is quaker-grammar; and, beside, you are both too incorrigible for me.” “I once heard thee say, that thou couldst never forbear setting one right, whom thou didst respect, although a stranger.” “True,” said I; “but I ought to have added this qualification;—except he be too old, or too ill-tempered to learn; or where he so errs, that the younger people are not likely to be led away, with his example.” “In general, I have too much veneration for age and good sense, ever to presume to hint, that it may not be infallible; but, where it is wrong, and attended with great authority of manner; and where that authority would be hurtful; I have always had; and I hope that I always shall have, the firmness and courage to interrogate, even aged men.” “I would have it distinctly understood, then, that I never correct them that I despise, or abhor; neither fools, nor scoundrels; for their own reputations are an antidote enough to their example:—nor the wise and respectable, when it is too late to benefit them; and nobody is nigh, to be carried away, by their authority.” “Well, well!” said the old man, rising—and Caroline immediately opened the Bible. He took out his great, heavy silver watch, with a glittering old fashioned steel chain, cunningly wrought; “If I remember right,” said he—“there are ten minutes left to us—thee was about to give us an account of some words—” Caroline shut the Bible, and leaned forward, earnestly; her beautiful hair falling down over her white hands, and shading her large mild eyes, like dishevelled shadow, rather than substantial hair. “And first,” he continued, “as to that word induce; how should that be pronounced?” “Assuredly, not as if it were written indooce; that was the fashion of the last age; nor indeuse—which is the sickly affectation of the French school; nor injuce— which is the barbarism of the present generation. But simply and purely, so as to sound the vowel u in the most forcible, and uncorrupt manner; as thus, indyuse.” “Injuce,” whispered Caroline, involuntarily. “Injuce, injuce,” said the mother, more audibly. “No, no, wife—that is wrong,” said the husband.— “Hear me—this is it—indguce—in-juice.” “No, indeed, far enough from it,” said I. “Do you pronounce the vowel u, dgu? No—that whole class of words—induce, produce, endure, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.—is to be sounded as if the u were written you; or the word divided thus—ind-uce, &amp;c.” “But, a more serious fault is universal here, I find. You always sound the vowel e, as if it were an u, in such words as the following: mercy—earth—persevere —person---perfect---impertinent; making of them, murcy--- urth---pursevere---purson---purfect---impurtinent. And you call it affectation in others, who have the courage to depart from your practice! Yet, some among yo; and those too, who have the quickest sense of the ridiculous; and are among the first to laugh at a Virginian, for calling a bear, a bar; stairs, stars; and at a yankee, for pronouncing the word does, as if it were written dooze; some too, whose delicacy of ear would be grievously offended, if one should say impurative---pu rumptory---or urrour, for peremptory---imperative--- errour, are constantly in the habit of outraging my ears, with the sounds urth---purson---purfect, &amp;c. &amp;c. All words, I find, which have a vowel following the conso nant after the first e, as in peremptory, you pronounce rightly; but, if there be two consonants, as in perfect, you do not. The first you call peremptory; the latter, purfect.” “The law is the same, in every case. The e should be always sounded, as in me, or in met. It has no such sound as the u. It is a shocking barbarism.” “But I observe that thee always says a-er, and fa-er; instead of air and fair. Is not that a little affected!” “To that, I am half inclined to plead guilty; for, I confess that I am almost alone, in that mode of pronunciation. Yet, the best authority that we have, establishes it. In speaking, however, I do not recollect any person, except myself, that uses it. Yet, the sound of ai in air, and fair, and in a multitude of other words, where they unite, is exactly the same, as in maid, aim, pail, rain. I pronounce it so; and, therefore, am I called affected. Depend upon it, that these delicacies will soon distinguish the well educated man, and the man accustomed to good society. It is no longer a proof of gentility, to pronounce errour and peremptory, right; the very vulgar would be startled to hear one of themselves say urrour and purumptory, now; yet, I can remember where the first[9] [9] I knew a justly celebrated lawyer—a Judge—a lecturer too, who always pronounced errour as if it were urrour. was common, among the well bred; and, even now, it is moer common to hear fashionable people—in their inarticulate gibberish, leavin out the final g, when they speak; and sayin' strenth, for strength —and I done this, for I did it; and I shew him, for I showed him; and she had went away, before I come; and I had drank enough, &amp;c. &amp;c. or, where is he at?—complete these execrable violations, with pronouncing the word erroneous as if it were urroneous. Nay, it was not long since, that I was listening to a beautiful creature; and holding my breath while I listened—when she came down upon me, with a long story about Capun so, and so, who give her them are books, what she had shew'd me, the night afore—it an't him (it are not him!) it is him—her and me walked together—&amp;c. &amp;c. “Judge of my feeling; I declare to you, dear mother, as I am a living man, that I could have gone down on my knees, before that woman, if it would have led her to attend a little more to her speech. But, the worst of it was, that while I was blushing for her, and pitying her, and afraid to look up,—there was probably not another person in the room, who observed her blundering! She touched the harp, with exceeding spirit and brilliancy; her voice was rich and harmonious; and there was a deep breathing of passion, as if her heart made melody within her; yet, when she came to sing some of the sweetest and most beautiful airs in our language, I was perpetually (not purpetually) mangled and teazed with the same vile pronunciation—that is, when she pronounced at all; for, in fashionable singing, it is impossible to conjecture what the subject is; you are permitted to hear nothing but expression, and the gamut, with variations; poetry and meaning are discarded. In general, the final consonants are omitted; and the most villanous blunders of the printers, consecrated.— Thus, in Moore's song. “The Meeting of the Waters,” all the copies that I know are, “Tis not the soft murmur of streamlet or hill!” for rill!—and you will always hear it sung so. I could name twenty others, to prove that women never think; and never care, either for the thought; the word; the English; or even the pronunciation, of what they sing. In the course of the entertainment, I heard a literary gentleman say, that, such a man was of a very desis-sive turn (meaning decisive;) that his char-uc-ter, was dif-fic-ult to hunderstand; that he had hof-ten (sounding the t) saw him; that he had lately had-ver-tiss'd (instead of advertised) for a place, where he could live, if he come in town; and that “directly he saw it” he waited hon im, &amp;c. and told him that the man, which had it last—he who was beat at, &amp;c. &amp;c.” “Another was called to sing; and did me the compliment, as I was near him, during his preliminary embarrassment, to ask me how I liked ho, noh, me luff no. It was rather a puzzling question; but, as I passed for a linguist, I thought that it might be as well to bow, as gracefully as I could; and try to make out, in what language it was, while he was singing it; or, if he would be so indulgent, get a copy of it, and decypher it, at my leisure.” “He began—threw his head back—stuck his hands in his brecches—(I knew that he had been abroad, by that, and probably seen some of the “no sex at all” gentry, of an Italian opera, perform)—straddled his legs apart; shut his eyes, and sang, like a good fellow, amid one universal murmur of applause. But not a word could I understand. Was it German? Italian, Russian, Cherokee, or what? The air too, seemed familliar enough; but I could not recollect it. I waited on him, the next day for a copy; he was superlatively polite; hoped that I was delighted with it, &amp;c. wondered that I had never met with it; and the next day, brought it to me, with his own hands, copied, O! exquisitely!” “I opened it, with one of my best bows. Judge of my astonishment! It was some minutes, before I could believe my own eyes, but a little consideration convinced me that they could be depended on; and that the song which I had heard, was English, tolerable English, at least, and called “Oh, no, my love, no.” “I saw Hezekiah, look at his watch. It was just the hour, and we parted for the night; nor did we meet again, until the next third day evening; that is, the evening of the day, called Tuesday.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. Pronunciation...Continued...Variety of women...Anecdotes... False curls...Deafness...Garters. “I have been thinking,” said the good lady to me, as soon as we had seated ourselves, “that this propensity of thine, William, is unamiable and imprudent: this, I mean, of reproving them, who speak a little wrong.” “A little wrong, mother!—there can he no such thing. They are altogether wrong, in the pronunciation of a word, if they be not altogether right.” “But it will make thee enemies, William; nay, it has already.” “What! and shall I not hazard something for the benefit of them, that I love? Shall I not, if I see a sweet creature's frock open at her shoulders; or a “beauty spot” upon her face, tell her of it, because she may, as women always do, at the most delicate of such intimations, blush and tremble a little; and be a little angry with me, as well as ashamed of herself? No—I have gone up to a woman in the street, whom I never saw, before; and told that her garter was trailing after her. Did she thank me for it? no—not then. But when she was at home, if she had any heart, she did, I am sure; and, if she had not, why should I care for her opinion? A hundred men were looking at her; many women; some boys; and a little kitten, as she went by a door; where it was playing, had leaped at the garter, and set all that saw it, in a roar. Nay, when everybody else was laughing at, or pitying a sweet girl, who, all alive with vivacity and frolick, was giving out her beauty and fire, to a score of young men, and just on the point of joining a cotillion. I, who was behind her; and alone,—had no respect for her, and no feeling, other than that of compassion, and was not even acquainted with her—I saw that her head ornaments were awry—her false curls loose; and just ready to fall. Others saw it too; but they were either men, who were afraid to approach her, like men; or women, who were maliciously holding back from the dance, and watching her, in expectation of the catastrophe. What could I do?—there was no time to be lost, the flirtation that she was carrying on, whether she danced or not, would speedily bring all her head ornaments into her lap. I approached her; and, from a sudden thought, I know not what suggested it—took out my handkerchief as if I had just picked it up; offering it to her;—“your handkerchief; miss,” said I —looking at her head dress, very significantly, at the same time. That moment, she uttered an exclamation in French, “Perhaps,” thought I—“O, perhaps she may understand French”. I repeated my offer in French—but her knowledge of it was exhausted. She stared at me; bowed, and put aside the hander-chief;—I added a hint relative to her situation; but she did not understand me. “Do not dance,” said I—“until you have been into your dressing room”—and, as I said this, I glanced again at her hair. She coloured— arose—faltered—and the tears came into her beautiful eyes. But—I saved her a mortification, that she never would have got over. The next day, a gentleman waited on me, with a challenge from a friend of his. In such matters, I have a way of my own. “I have nothing to write to your friend, sir,” said I-“nothing to say, till I have seen him. Let him call upon me; and I will then give some kind of satisfaction, I promise you.” The man was difficult to appease; bullied and threatened, a good deal, by proxy, until, I was obliged to— no matter—neither of us was hurt, and I found that all my benevolence had been mistaken for cruelty, and wantonness. The girl had not magnanimity enough to tell her lover (he was a new one) what I had done; and why I had done it: and all that he was permitted to know, was what he had seen—that I had spoken to the fool that he loved,—without any introduction;—that she was mortally offended;—that she left the room, in tears, without dancing in the cotillion, for which she was engaged;—and that she had refused to give any explanation of what I had said—probably, as he thought, poor simpleton! out of tenderness to him.” “And once too, where an amiable girl, who was a little hard of hearing, had been over-persuaded to sit at a piano, with which she was unacquainted; the keys of which were very hard and stiff, while the keys of that, which she was accustomed to playing upon, were delicate and soft. She began to sing; and touched the keys very softly—very—as she would, her own, for an accompaniment. Poor soul! it emitted no sound—not any: not a note!—And the people about her were cruel enough, to let her continue to expose her infirmity, till I lost all patience; and quietly intimated to her that the notes were not very distinct. She coloured; and has not forgiven me, to this day, I verily believe.” “So is it with you women, in everything. If your vanity be wounded, with the friendliest hand; with the most salutary intention, it is a mortal affront, never to be atoned for, or forgiven. Many an one, have I offended, by preventing her from making herself ridiculous for ever; though I did it, not harshly, nor publickly; but quietly, and kindly, as I would my own sister, or child, or beloved one.” “But why give thyself such trouble?” said Eunice. “It were better, I think, to let every one do as he pleases. It is an unthankful office, at best; and may not the utility of thy advice be questioned. For example; if we pronounce as other people about us do—that is enough; is it not?—we are intelligible; and to what other purpose would we have language applied?” “If that argument be good, mother,” said I—“it will go to justify all barbarisms—stop all improvement.— The Yorkshireman pronounce as the people do, that are about him; and he is understood. But is that enough? However, we have said enough on this subject now. Tell me, in one word; shall I abandon the practice or not?” “Thee may—nay, I wish thee, to correct Lynee,” said the father; to which the mother assented; and Lynee too, or her pretty eyes told a fib, was not very averse to it. X “Well!—on one condition, I will obey you. It is this, that you agree to act in this matter, as you do, in all others, according to that which you believe to be right, without regarding what your neighbours may do, or think, or say. If you will agree to this, I do not despair of making your daughter abandon all her evil habits of pronunciation, and grammar; numerous as they are, in the course of a few months; together with her, “it is me,” “it is him,” “it is her,” and “who have you seen.” If you do not—henceforth, I will give myself no trouble about her language, or utterance;—I am resolved, I cannot endure this perpetual irritation and soreness. It wears upon me; and, when I hear a principle avowed, by a judicious parent, which, if followed, would justify every species of vulgarity in pronunciation, I am ready to take an oath-yes an oath —never again to open my lips upon the subject. If it be enough, to speak as others do, where shall we stop? with our countrymen? our provinicials? our citzens? townsmen? companions? or family? Every family has its own peculiar vulgarities; many, that are distressing to others. Yet, you would not correct them, because, the family “understand each other.” And, “what is the purpose of language, but to make ourselves understood?” This might be well enough, if you were never to go out of your own family; your own town; your own circle of acquaintances; your own province, or your own country—but—here Hezekiah laughed out-right; at the sound whereof, his wife stared at him, some minutes in astonishment; and well she might, for she had not heard him laugh aloud for years before. “Thee can't leave the subject; thee can't! I see plainly,” said the benevolent old man; as soon as he could speak—“that is so like thee!—taking leave, but never going—saying farewell to a subject, but never leaving it.” I was rather mortified—it is in vain to deny it:—one does not like to be told of his infirmities, be they what they may, so bluntly;—but, like other people, I joined in the laugh, in an odd hysterical way, and began my story anew. It was a rainy night; and, not a soul came in, to disturb us, till I was through. I was often inetrrupted, for my levity, or for something worse; but the result was nearly what follows. “Soon after I had arrived where there was a society of friends, as I have said before, I thought proper to claim such of their privileges as were accessible to me. I went, now and then, to their church; and wrote to the Monthly Meeting, nearest to my native place, for a certificate of membership; for, having been born a member, I continued one, till dismissed. One was prepared for me; but miscarried. Another—it shared the same fate. I never received a third, till it was nearly all over with me. In the mean time, certain bailiffs, who were marvellously incredulous as to my right of exemption, inasmuch as I used the profane language; and had been seen by more than one of their number, in more than one ugly scrape, where my pacifick temper was not so abundantly conspicuous, were rather clamorous for certain militia fines. Now it happened that, “conscientiously scrupulous” as I was— about bearing arms, I was still more, about paying militia fines; and, most of all, about going to prison--so, at last, I compounded with my conscience; the scripture, and the bailiff; all at the same time, by paying them a year in advance. This came to the knowledge of the society, and they appointed a committee of shoemakers and tailors; plain substantial men, not having the gift of the gab, to any degree like myself, to wait upon me. I found the matter exceedingly pleasant, for a time; for these thick headed gentlemen permitted me to have all the talk to myself. I pleaded scripture; for the—I beg your pardon—the best friend, that I have, can do that, you know, to servehis turn; I quoted the command to submit to the powers that be;—that of rendering to Cæsar the things that are Cæsars; and that, where the Son of man says, that he came, not to bring peace, but a sword among the nations. Nay—I contended till my own head ached—(I say nothing of theirs, for they never gave me an opportunity of asking them about that— after we parted; and I was too busy, at their first visit,) that it was not a part of Christ's mission among men, to preach unequivocal submission, else why have you; ye, that are followers of his submissiveness—laws, bolts, bars? and why hath our indignation been left to us? or why, indeed, was it ever given to us.” “But,” said Eunice—“He said to him that smote off the ear of another, “put up thy sword. He, that slayeth by the sword, shall fall by the sword.” “Hear me, for a moment, mother,” said I—“Be patient for one moment. If it were truly the main object of his mission among men, to preach entire and unresisting submission, to evil and insult;-would it not have been taught continually and plainly? Would it not have been the burden of his whole doctrine? Would it not, at least, have been most familiarly known to his immediate followers? Would it not have been known by his disciples? Yet—I pray you—reflect for one moment— Peter, a rash man---goes into the presence of his master, with a sword upon his thigh—stands by him, unrebuked, while they are surrounded—with a sword upon his thigh; an instrument only of bloodshed; and, finally draws it, in the presence of his master, and slices off another man's ear! Would thy servant do this, thinkest thou? Draw your own conclusions. Mine are these: either the mission of Christ was not what you believe it—to inculcate non-resistance;-or, it was not distinctly taught, even to his disciples;--or—it is the only conclusion left, one of the three must be true—he, who wore a sword in his master's presence—misunderstood his doctrine; or contemned his authority. Now, take your choice of these three dilemmas. But let me return to the committee. They went away, just about as wise as they came; and, reported, I suppose, that it were about as rational to “hold dealing” with a wild beast, as with me. Another lot were chosen; good men and true, with thicker skulls if possible, and less to say, than their predecessors; all that I can recollect of their argument was, that they sat still with me, for half an hour or so; groaning inwardly, now and then, as if they had the cholick; looking all the time at my fashionable dress, from head to foot, as if they were my unpaid tailors; taking an inventory of it, in pounds, shillings and pence.” “In the mean time, for they were very patient, and I; how could I be otherwise!--it was a dull season with me, and I found it quite a genteel affair to have the meeting come to me—instead of being obliged to go to the meeting. Mohammed and the mountain.” “But, in the mean time, I had a rather unlucky affair of another kind, to trouble the society with. A great lubberly bull headed fellow; the biggest of about half a score, that I had quarrelled with, on the same morning, had been nominated to give me a flogging. Now, if there be any one thing on this earth, that I have a mortal aversion to, it is that of being publickly kicked and cuffed about, in the middle of a street—the broadest and most frequented street of a large town—at the very hour too, of all others, when the women are out, like frogs after a shower—just about twilight, of a long, beautiful summer day.” “About this time too, I happened to be in lo—ahem —rather intimate with a little dark-eyed coquette, who was playing the devil with me—I beg your pardon. I had an engagement to see her, one evening; one of the pleasantest, as I live, that ever I saw, heard or read of—the sky was all of a floating rose colour; and the air came by one, balmy and scented, like the breath of young girls, that have been romping on new mown hay. It was just about sunset; the street was thronged with fine women; and, there was an unusual stillness about. As I turned the corner, with a heavy orange tree stick in my hand, the gift of my dearest friend —(at that time;) I saw, the moment that I came in sight, half a dozen persons that were standing on the side walk, at a little distance before me, separate; and run off, different ways, as if a rocket had been thrown among them—(just as I have seen your tatterdemalian militia, after a defeat, when trying to rally in platoons—) and pop into the houses and stores, along the street; and look out, as if they expected something wonderful to happen. I stopped and looked, too; but, saw nothing, and suspected nothing, until I was arrested X 2 by a brutal voice, calling to me by name, and asking me, “if I did'nt think, sure, that I was a pretty fellow? and be damned to me?” “It was rather an odd question. I thought; but still, I had been so in the habit of hearing it, on all hands, from my youth upward, that I turned deliberately round; measured the fellow, from head to foot; and said, in my prettiest manner—“why—yes—” (I like to be modest)—“ye—yes— rather so.” Some other conversation followed; during which, I was so intolerably frightened, that, upon my life, I would have given a hundred pounds, to be out of the scrape. I saw what it was coming to. I was, probably, about to be beaten by a great bull-Irishman, to his own heart's content; and my own everlasting disgrace. My heart collapsed— and gave out the blood, like hot wine, at the thought. A blow then, would have been fatal to me; but, at the next breath—by heaven! I could have torn him, or any man that ever breathed, limb from limb, had I been shut up alone with him, where no mortal aid could come to him. I stood upright; I felt a commotion within me. He had waked the lion in my heart.” “He approached me, brandishing his arms.” “Stop!” said I—“stop!—if you have any desire to quarrel, there is a way of doing it, like men.” “Noh, noh!—none o' your sword and pistols; and them are sart o' things, for me—nothin but your bull-dogs.” “I expected a blow, every moment.—that is, I expected him to attempt one; and, I was prepared to lay him at my feet, at the first movement of his arm.” “Let us go to some other place;” said I—“it is too publick, here.” “But no—nothing would do for the brute, but a scuffle, there. Perhaps it was the better for me. It made me desperate. The thought of being beaten there, was death to me; it shook me to the dust.” “Nothing keeps my hands off of you, hinney,” said he, after a few more flourishes, and seating himself on a box at the door—“but—but—if I thought you would'nt take the law o' me, I'd drub ye—I would—directly.” “That was too bad. “The law!” said I, “No. I will not take the law of you.” “Still, he did not strike me; and I turned, leisurely, to go away; glad enough, I assure you, to get off so well. But my moderation fired him anew.” “Ye're a d—d puppy,” said he. “My first design was, to level my orange tree at his head. If I had, it would infallibly have shattered his skull, thick as it was; but, I did not—I changed the direction; struck at him, with it, and just turned it aside; he caught at it, and I let it go. The scuffle was soon over. He fell, two or three times; and finally, grappled with me. This, I had sought, all along, to avoid; for, I knew that it would be the death of me—and I was very weak —if I did not heave him. But, I know not how it was —I made one effort—one, only—and, for a moment, I felt as if every blood-vessel in my body had been ruptured—I lifted him from the earth, and dashed him upon the pavement.—Never shall I forget the horrible voice that broke from him, as he fell over the curb-stone, with a tremendous squelch. We were separated. His wife appeared at the window, shricking and bawling; and the street was crowded with people. There was not a moment to lose. I was not hurt—but, I had lost my hat; and, such was the prodigious strength of the fellow, that, when he grappled me, once, with his right hand, he took a handful of cloth out of my coat; waistcoat and shirt; buttons and all, from my breast. My hat was given to me; and, the next moment, I felt something like a blow, whistling by my head. I dodged it; and found that I was assailed again, unarmed as I was, with a bludgeon. I turned round; begged a cane, and desired that he might be kept from running away. Now was my time!—with a cane, I felt sure, Irishman though he were, that I could beat him to a jelly, in ten minutes! but, he saw fit to sneak off, while his wife kept up the show of defiance and threat, by trumpetting away at the window above. Thus ended that affair.—So little was I hurt; so little discomposed by it; that, when I had buttoned my frock coat over my opposite breast, so as to conceal the ruin that had been made; and elbowed my way through the crowd—I remember that I was asked by several persons, who saw me coming away from the centre, what was the matter? Nay—I went to my appointment, and spent the evening quite sentimentally; and nobody there, suspected aught of the matter.” “But, the best of it is to come. The scoundrel took the law o' me, after all!—told his own story, swore that he was cruelly beaten; confined for several days; and I know not what else.” “But how happened it?” said the judge. “What did you say to Mr. Adams.” “Hi said nothin to him, sir, your honour.” “Nothing!—it is very extraordinary—a small man to attack one of your size, without any provocation— what did you do to him? nothing too, I suppose.” “Nothin, sir, your honour.” “Are you sure?” “Very sure, your honour, sir. Hi only called him a d—d puppy, sir, that was all, sir!” “Well—and what did he do, then?” said the judge.” “He knocked me down, your honour, hi—.” “And what else could you expect?” said the judge; —and sent us both away; him with an admonition to be civiller of speech; and I, to govern my temper —with a fine, and some cost; just enough to make the affair ten times more disgraceful to the sufferer, than if he had put up quietly with the beating. But that is the common course of justice, every where, I find.” “But, as I was telling you, the friends took up the matter; and, to propitiate them, I wrote a beautiful article, for a publick magazine; in which I proved, incontestably, that no man had a right to put up his hand, or wink with his eyes, when a blow was aimed at him. This done; and an acknowledgment, in which I acknowledged that they were all wrong; and I, altogether right, in sundry matters of great moment; and confessed to some change which I really felt; (and no human being was ever more grateful for any change, than I was, about that time)—being made. I was received into the society again; and protected, annually, from military duty. A matter which kept my conscience, which was apt to be exceedingly turbulent, when hotly dunned, in a state of uncommon quietude, for a long time. But the devil is ever going about seeking whom he may devour; not that I would impute anything so preposterous to him, as the thought of going about for such cattle as I, no—we generally spare him that trouble.— And in the progress of a season or two, I began to have some strange notions of my own, about man's accountability. I could not conceive of more than one, First Cause. It troubled me too, to comprehend some things that, to the dullest creatures that I had ever met with; creatures that had hardly the wit to keep themselves out of fire and water, were most exceedingly plain.— And, after much painful, very painful, and I would say devout meditation, if that were not a word prohibited to the hetero lox;—and exclusively appropriated, like the word evangelical, to them that preach the Deity as not forgiving—dear father; but an implacable and wrathful God; as One, who, while he teaches man to forgive his fellow man seven times in a day, if he repent, can not himself be appeased, till man hath paid the uttermost farthing of his debt to him, either in agony or substitution; and not, what he had proclaimed himself to be, “the Lord! the Lord God! long suffering and merciful!” when he went by, in the wind and darkness—I came to the following conclusion, as the sum and substance of all religion—“To do as I would be done by.” “I was denounced. I was called upon to acknowledge things, that I did not, and could not believe; and to believe, what I could not understand. I smiled. I was charged with having denied the Divinity of Christ; and that, too, tremendous presumption! in the presence of E. W. herself—a woman—with all the childish pedantry of a woman—who hath gone throughout all America, dealing out the fag-end of all the sermons that were ever written; and the lees; and refuse fragments of all thought and science; dealing it out too, the ineffable nonsense—as the inspiration of Almighty God—as if the Almighty God, dealt in bad English; or did not understand the commonest rules of logick and inference. Nay—forgive me—I mean not to be profane or irreverent. This woman won her way into notoriety, by her masculine voice; rather than by her masculine understanding; and by crowding it home adroitly, that, to be brought to exhibit herself before the world, among men—the wise and the powerful; exposed to taunt, ridicule and upbraiding; a lone woman, she must have been wrought upon, by no common sense of duty: must have been impelled and sustained by no earthly hand— as if women have not an ambition of their own--a vanity and pride of power, altogether their own.—Why, one might as well argue that the infatuated creatures, who used to wander naked through the populous places of London, could never have been brought to it, a thing so contrary to their natures! but by an omnipotent sense of obligation; or unless, upheld in their shame and humiliation, by ministering angels; O, woman! woman!—it is thy nature to expose thyself!—it is thy pride and office; the object of all thy solicitude,—nay of thy creation to do it. I have never known one—no, not one, that would not have gone naked, as she was born, if the custom of society would have permitted her.—Eve, and the women of the South-sea island; and the women of high rank, at balls, are the same creatures; they go, as nearly naked as they can, for a cold climate and the fashion. I do not know one, at this moment, however trembling, sensitive, delicate and modest she may be, but—where it is made to appear her duty; or where she can find a decent excuse for it—is willing enough to disarray herself, body and mind; else why does a woman ever marry? Mother! such are my feelings, when, I hear the loud voice of a woman, no matter where; in her own house; or in an assembly of men, that I could go backward, reverently, and throw my cloak over the nakedness of her spirit. But let me return.” “I replied calmly,---reasoned and remonstrated with a committee of intelligent, worthy, and high minded men, that were now sent to me. They soon learnt to treat me with respect: and I love to remember them. But they did me wrong. “It is your duty,” said I, “to dismiss me. If it be essential to adopt a creed, I cannot remain among you. My only creed is one that Jehovah hath written here, here, upon the tablet of my heart. But would it not be well to leave points of belief, to be settled between man and his Maker? You charge me with denying the divinity of Christ. I do not. I only say this—that— to my belief; and he knows that it is my belief, and understanding, Christ is not God—the only God; the Everlasting. What he is, I do not take upon myself to say; whether divine or human—or a compound of both natures. I do not pretend to fix his rank in creation. It is enough for me, that he came among us; and taught us the purest and loftiest religion. He may be more than all the powers, angel and archangels, princedoms, dominations, thrones; but, to my heart, and my head, he is not God.” “Then he must be man,” said one of the committee. “Really,” said I, “that, I do not see, so clearly.” “O yes, William—Divine, or human, he must be-God or man,” said he; and the committee nodded their approbation. “Pray” said I—“what are the angels?—they are not men, “are they gods?” They were staggered for a moment. “But, perhaps they are divine,” I added. “I admit that they are; so is Christ; so is man. We all have a portion, more or less of Divinity. That is my doctrine.” “But the play, William, the play—what do thee say to that?” continued the committee. “I had written a play.” “Have you ever read it?” said I. “It is called a play. But how know you that it is not a sermon? It is—in reality.” “Read it, before you condemn me; will you agree to denounce morality, if it take the shape of a dialogue? There are sacred dramas, you know, by Hannah Moore. Young has written a play—Addison, Johnson, Milton—good and great men, have written plays. Beside—I wrote it for bread. Will you prohibit a brick maker from selling brick for a theatre?—A carpenter, a painter, from working upon it? Where will you stop? Men-I tell you, for I know it; that, base and profligate, as are our theatres in general; ministering to our worst appetites in the worst way; teaching women to hear and see, what they would blush to read about; or to describe to their own fathers—yet, there is no comfort or convenience of life but may be abused, to as great a degree.” “However, I do not defend myself. I am not ashamed of that tragedy. I am not sorry that I wrote it; and I will not say so. I am proud of it. I will not say, therefore, that I am sorry for it. But—that I am sorry for certain opinions which I have avowed heretofore; and repented of since,—I will confess. If that will satisfy you—well. If not—dismiss me. To deal plainly with you, I think it is your duty to dismiss me. The world know, that, in nothing whatever, do I conform to your discipline; and yet, that I am protected, as conscientiously scrupulous. That is wrong. Dismiss me, then—but let your reason be, not, that I deny the divinity of Christ, for that will admit of dispute;—and I say positively that I do not:—but that I have violated your law.” “The men assented to this; shook hands with me, cordially, and departed; made their report; were laughed at for their opinion of me; and another committee were appointed in their stead. Would you believe it!— The first had gone away, and reported, that I denied the Divinity of Christ!—yes! after all that I had said to them.” “The second were, at first, inclined to treat with me, like dictators—much as men treat with fractious and rebellious children. But I soon brought them to their senses.” “They found that they had to deal with one, that was not to be trifled with; and could not be easily baffled, or terrified, or awed. Old as they were—wise as they were—I felt my equality with them; and I made them feel it, too.” “Meeting after meeting was had. I cannot complain of them. They were full of caution, wisdom, benignity, and forbearance. But, one evening—it was the last— one of them, when put to the question—and it could be no longer evaded—acknowledged that they also should report me to the meeting, as one that denied the divinity of Christ!” “I could bear this no longer. I took my stand on the spot. “Look ye,” said I, “if you want to turn me out—do it; but do it peaceably. Don't provoke me.— You have reason enough to justify you; and I am ready to go out, quietly. But, mark me—if you assign that reason, I will put you to the proof. If you expel me, I know my course. It is one, that I will follow. I will get out a mandamus—(I knew enough of law, to understand the power of that writ; for it had set the whole neighbourhood by the ears, once—when issued to restore a libidinous, profligate scoundrel, to the desk, that he had dishonoured and polluted, again and again, by his wickedness)—and compel you to prove this. You are a corporate body. I am a member, entitled to certain privileges. Assign that reason, if you dare; and I will never give you a moment's rest, in this world, nor the next, till you have proved the whole—every word, and every letter!” “They looked at each other, in astonishment. It had never entered their heads, that I would stand at bay, so formidably, at the last hour.” “We are not to be frightened,” said one of them, resolutely. “I do not desire to frighten you,” was my reply.— “I would only have you prepared, for what I shall assuredly do. Think of it—do as you please; but, my resolution is taken.” “We separated; and, a short time afterward, two of the same committee, waited on me, again, with my certificate of dismissal, fashioned according to my own dictation; adding, that there lay an appeal—and that the thing had been taken a good deal to heart, among them. I knew it. I knew, that one man had shed tears, when the disavowal was consummated.” “I thought for a moment. My heart took fire. What! an appeal? It was the very thing! It would give me the best opportunity, in the world, of shaking their temple to its foundation, with all the Philistines about me. I inquired into the form. But, they had been so kind, so respectful, of late, to me; and were so truly interested in my welfare, before they left me, that I could not do it. No, no—I could not; and I told them so.” “No,” said I, “if I should make an appeal, it would not be from any movement of conscience; any desire of being reinstated; but only from a desire to show myself. Out of respect to you, therefore—you, who have, at last, learnt to know me—I will not.” “We parted; and the last words that were spoken to me, were the following. Shall I ever forget them?— They were spoken by one of the ministry. “Farewell, William!—farewell! I wish thee well; and I do not entirely give up the hope of seeing thee among us again, yet; and, perhaps, a fellow labourer.” That is, a preacher among the quakers! I!—I!—a quaker preacher!— Well, well—it may be. The very oddity of the thing, may, one day or other, bring it about. It works in my mind yet.” Eunice wiped her eyes, when I ended; and gave me an affectionate embrace; Hezekiah shook his head, with an air of uncommon perplexity; and Caroline, affecting not to see me, stooped down, so that her smooth brown hair fell all over her neck and face; but I could see her sweet eyes dancing through it, like lamping starlight dimmed, and dashed, by the tears of heaven, and the blown shadowy tresses of the wind. We parted.</field>

Eliza?...Jealousy...Game laws...Camp-Meeting...Unknown....Religion...Adventure...Expostulation ...Jealousy...Dream...Discovery! I had been above three years in this family; was yet young, fiery, and adventurous; having an uncommonly deep acquaintance with men; with the human heart, and with human passion; nay, an unexampled one, I might say; for I have never, yet, met with a man of twenty-five, so deeply read, as I was, at twenty, in that terrible lore. I have spoken of Caroline, frequently—and, as if by accident; and the fact is, that I have been afraid to speak of her. It is a melancholy subject—a painful one; and, as I do not feel myself altogether guiltless of her death—her destruction—I cannot think of her, without a deep agitation here; and a strange, tremulous motion of the eyes, as if—as if—they would weep, but could not. I loved Caroline—fervently loved her.— But how? Not as I ever loved any other earthly thing. My tenderness for her was affectionate and pure; but rather compassionate, than lofty; rather sweet and tender, than thrilling. I cannot well describe it; but, my belief is, now, that I loved her—because she loved me. She was about thirteen, when I first saw her, and rather small of her age; add to which, that she was dressed so like a child, in a neat little grey frock, and white apron, with her changeable deep brown hair crossed so meekly over her forehead; and parted with such delicate accuracy, that I only thought of her, as of a singularly interesting child, of about ten or twelve, shamefully maltreated in her dress. Some months wore away, and I was the happiest of human creatures; nothing troubled me, except the silence of my dear sister Elizabeth—who, certainly, did not rightly fulfil the duty of a correspondent. But why should I complain? It is the nature of women, even of the best—for she was, and is one of the best—to be warm and passionate awhile, and then—reader, I leave it to you to finish the sentence. I do not like to be severe, or bitter.— Women part—the dearest of friends; nay, so do men— swearing a perpetual friendship; are devoutly attentive, for awhile, in their correspondence; grow cooler and cooler; laying by their letters, when received, till their glow and beauty are-gone; and all the emotion that they first awakened, is forgotten; at last, they are ready to reply; and then they sit down, reluctantly, as to a task, not to be put off any longer; angry with themselves, and willing to find any excuse for their own coldness; write a formal, unnatural page or two, as if they were making a speech at one, rather than conversing with him; and bless themselves for their own courage.— Shame on them. Friendship is a plant of a delicate growth. It cannot be neglected with impunity. People may love each other truly and heartily; they may grow to each other in their devout pulsation, till they have, literally, but one heart and one soul; yet, a little neglect, a very little, constantly operating, as it always will, in a geometrical proportion, acting and reacting forever, will be sure to sunder them, at last, and deaden all their sensibilities. A certain degree of communion—daily communion, if possible—is necessary, between people that are growing old together. Our appetites; opinions; and modes of thinking; are all liable to change. We know that. But we learn to accommodate ourselves to this change, while it is gradual; and while it is only gradual, like the growth of children, or the approach of old age, upon those, with whom we daily associate, we do not observe it, and are never startled by it. But, that intercourse interrupted for awhile, we meet our dearest friends, almost like strangers. Have you not met some one that had been dear to you many years before, after a long and trying separation; during which, no letters came from him, to tell the growth of his understanding, or the change of his heart; and no intelligence whatever from them that had seen him, and could tell how he looked and spoke? Have you not? And did you not meet that friend, rather as a stranger, with—if there were any rising, at all, of the heart—a rising, like a cold spring of water, too suddenly disturbed; than as your friend? O, it is too true. I have bitterly experienced it. Many a cold, unnatural hour, have I spent with them that I had loved; them that had loved me; after a long absence, during which, we had grown up with other inclinations; suffered differently; been happy differently; and felt the sunshine and wind of a different hemisphere, upon us. The work of friendship, and often of love, when we meet anew, is all to be done over again. We tread cautiously, as we approach the darkened hearth; and tremble, while we stir the ashes, lest we may find no embers there; nay, lest we may find adders there. Some up, or to allude to them; nor even the heart to do it, lest will be, often, when we have not the power to touch them sweet, thrilling reminiscences there may be; and there we may find no answering intonation. O, it is very trying, to find that she hath forgotten, what you but too well remember; to find her heart silent, when yours hath been touched and tuned to the memory of other days. You are prepared—your hand is lifted—the apparitions prepare to do your bidding; but you fear to emit a sound, lest—the cold, desolate thought!—O, it is bitter!—lest there may be no answering cadence in the air. Their unison is done with—their echo and sympathy are over! Such is the influence of separation from women. How many a lover; how many a friend, hath been lost, by the ungentle ministering of a froward hand; yet, it were kinder to uproot the plant at once; to snap off every bough, though it bled perfume to reproach you; to scatter all its blossoms, and trample them in the dirt; than to let it perish of neglect. Give me the spoiler! I can abide and resist her; but spare me, O heaven, that wintry consumption; that! where we droop away in our desolation, alone, for ever and ever—and perish, without a tear, or a thought! No, no—the furnace rather! Y 2 No, it is not the rough wind, nor the rough hand, that desolates the beautiful landscape of the heart—the aromatick herbage, and blossoming of the affection; no!— but it is the unheeding, unrelenting negligence of them that we love. Would you preserve the friendship of another?—your intimacy with him?—keep him acquainted with every alteration of your thought;—every pulsation of your heart;—and keep yourself acquainted with his, in the same manner. Your friendship, then, will be, if judiciously formed at first, in age, pursuit, and character, perpetual. If otherwise—no matter how well you may be fitted, for that high and noble intercourse, the communion of brave and great natures—you will be strangers, at last, happen what will. You cannot meet, cordially, after a long separation; it is impossible; for you are not sure, that what was acceptable in your manner, when you parted, may not be offensive; or, at least, unacceptable, now that you have met again. You are afraid to forget the years that are passed, entirely, when you meet; though there is a natural propensity in all our hearts, to retake and re-occupy their places, wherever they meet them again, and in the same humour, too; so that an old man, who goes among them, who knew him when he was a young man, will be pretty sure to forget that he is old; or to make them forget it; and your manner will be cold and unnatural. This, though he may no longer know what is natural to you, he can detect at once. The veriest child can point out what is unnatural, even in a stranger. And nature is so captivating, that, when ungraceful, and repulsive it will do, what the most gracious and winning address, which is unnatural, will fail to do. Your friend, of course thinks you vulgar, or affected; and you think the same of him. For we have but one standard. He who acts differently from that.— be it in word, manner, or dress, is always, in our estimation, vulgar or affected—vulgar, if he resemble the many; affected, if he resemble the few. Neither of these things can we tolerate.— Reader, you must pardon me. I have suffered cruelly, frequently, by this neglect of others. It is a crime; for it is unkindness of the most unamiable nature; it is bruising, negligently, the heart that feels only, because it hath been torn away from another. I cannot accuse myself of it. No—I never lost a friend, by negligence. If I were weary of him, I told him so. If I had wronged him, I atoned for it; if he had wronged me, I forgave him. No!—whatever I have lost, has been by a stern, unbending honesty; by doing, rashly, as I would be done by; by reasoning after this fashion—“If he cease to be my friend, because of this—this, which I do, or say, because I love him—his friendship was never worth having; he was never the man that I took him for.”— I have never yet lost one by negligence; and, if I keep my senses, I never will. Yet, had I not been willing to forgive almost anything, in them that I love, I had been friendless, at this hour—this, of my loneliness and widowhood. Thus much as an offering to the torn and lacerated heart of one—one that knows me—it were better than a benumbed one. It was a duty, and I have done it; harshly, it may be, but honestly. And now I have done—saying only this; that, when your conscience reproaches you, for having delayed too long, a visit, or a letter, to a friend, call to mind the difficulty, that you have found, in renewing a correspondence, after a long interruption, by letter; or, in answering one, that had lain by you, till all the spirit had evaporated; the colour faded; and the beauty was an old story; or, in renewing a cordial, frank interchange of thought, after a long interval, with one, whom you once knew so well, that you popped in upon her, at all hours, without ringing; without knocking; and without ceremony. Your first letter is cold, laboured, artificial, and dissatisfactory, to yourself, and to your friend; your answer affectedly cordial, impertinent, or stupid; and your visit, one of parade and ceremony. Bless me! where have I wandered? Let me return. I look back for several pages, and I find, that I was telling you of Caroline; and that I was happy, and prodigal of my happiness, at this time; and that it was dashed only by the negligence of my sister, in not keeping me informed of her health and happiness—for both were precarious, as I shall hereafter relate to you. At last, I discovered a strange malady of spirit upon me; I could not sleep; my appetite failed; and I had fits of melancholy, silent abstraction, that were new to me. Was it love? It could not be. It was utterly unlike aught that I had ever experienced. There were but five or six girls, in all the world too, whom it was possible to attribute my disorder to; namely: Olivia, Susan, Anne, Rachel, and two or three Elizas. Thinking in this way, of my malady—I began a review of all that I could possibly be in love with. The first, we called the Little Belt. She was a little, active, tight built creature; with a warm heart; a voluble tongue, and a pleasant voice. I had met her once, under circumstances, sufficiently romantick, it was true. I was visiting a pretty little country village, with a friend of mine, in the depth of winter. His object was, to see an “old flame” of his;—and mine—to get my ears frozen first, and my shins roasted, afterward, under pretence of a sleigh ride—free of expense. I saw his “flame;” and my cold fingers were all the better for it. In her, I recognised an old acquaintance of mine, whom I had thought of, many and many a time, for a year or two, before, without any hope or expectation of meeting her on earth. I was delighted—and so was he; we sat and talked the most delicious sentiment; he, about old times, and his school-boy tenderness; and I, of our singular acquaintance, until it was time to separate. In the mean while, however, Olivia—a neighbour, who saw that her companion had company, popped in, accidentally upon us; though it snowed and blew, like vengeance; and the houses were half a mile apart—without her bonnet. This, of course, excited some consideration; and in me, for such is my nature, when I see women behave like fools—some reproof. She liked me the better for it; and, while George (my friend,) a very sensible man, then; but married now—packed off, through the snow drift, one way, with his Eliza; I waded off, in a contrary direction, my teeth chattering in the wind, which would have sharpened a razor—with Olivia. We came to the door. It was near midnight. “Wo'nt you walk in?” said she, laughingly. Hang my picture! —not me—I do not say, hang me—I have left off that practice—it is very ungenteel—if I had'nt half a mind to walk in, and stay all night—but, I hadn't “brought my knitting work,” and spend a week with her; and I knew well what a woman meant, in that county, when she said—“pray sir, if you should ever come within a dozen miles of our house, I shall depend on your staying there, all night.” So, I did'nt go in—though there was something in her manner, to speak seriously, that went to my heart. I paused. My lips trembled; (not with the cold) and I bid her farewell, as I shook her hand, with a melancholy feeling, as if I were about to part with her, for ever. It is sad—is'nt it? to part, for ever, as your heart tells you, with lips and eyes, that you have just learnt how to quicken?—that you have just met, and been happy with. It is a dreary and uncomfortable feeling to one, with a long walk before him, at midnight—in a snow storm. When I travel, therefore, with a probability of never travelling the same road again, I never permit myself to make any acquaintance. It is too like death, to part for ever, and ever, it may be with aught that you have talked pleasantly with, even in a strange land. Well!—Well!—. I parted from Olivia—and thought of her many a time, that night; even when I was holding one of the only two hands that the woman had—fact—while my friend held the other. I had not been acquainted with her two hours;—but she was an old maid—an amiable one, though; and when they begin to melt, like snow in the summer solstice, there is no stopping them--the flow of their hearts, I mean;—and—bless me!—lost again—and, in short, I thought of Olivia, even while the hand of another woman was heating in mine, over a slow fire—when I was dying to go to bed—(alone I mean) or yawn in her face. And yet, she was amiable, and I do respect her. Just one year after this,—it was very extraordinary--I was in a part of this world, where Captain Cook, himself, would not have gone, in the winter, for his nose— I'll engage. I was desolate and alone—when heaven had compassion on me, all at once, and brought me along side of the Little Belt, again. I was agitated and delighted; my thrills returned; and all the sweet disorder of love, sentimentality and romance; until, at last, I am half ashamed to own it—I set to work upon poetry, again; and happening, by a well managed intrigue, to occupy the very bed room; nay, why should I not tell the whole truth? the very bed where Olivia had slept; —what a different matter a little difference in the tense will make in these verbs! time is important, alike, in grammar and love; verbs and women—is it not? --I scribbled the walls all over, with the vilest stuff, in favour of Olivia. But, it was too late; she had already slipped through my fingers; and, whatever your downright spiritualities may say, such as Sir Charles Grandison; and Thaddeus of Warsaw; and such cattle, I found it but cold comfort, to press even the pillow of Olivia—alone. Yes—I hate affectation, and I may as well own it. I tried hard to be sentimental; hard enough—heaven knows! I hugged and squeezed the pillow—kicked and sprawled about, in my sleep—and made verses, all the day long—but, it would'nt come— the fountain had run dry—and there was really so little consolation, in freezing, of a long night, under the same bed clothes; and in the same, that she had frozen in; that, really—heretick that I was! apostate to love and romance! I had a prodigious inclination to migrate into a warmer climate—for, there was one nearer to me—in the very next room--but, hang it, that was kept by “the dragon of prudery” too. Well, then—it was not Olivia, with whom I was in love; beside, she was already married; and I was really a fellow of too much principle to be in love with, or catch a fever of—a married woman. No---no---it was not Olivia. Was it Susan then? Possibly!—Her round black eyes, her neatly turned waist, and fine manner; together with her untrained cordiality---the manner in which she danced---the occasional emotion which she betrayed, when I came near her.---Ah no---it was not Susan. There was no delicious bobbing of my poor heart, in my blood, like a newly caught fish, in cold water; none of that inward titillation and trickling, as if,---I hardly know what---it is difficult to tell, to another, who has not felt it; and he that has, will understand me, without my telling it. It is a sensation, as if your blood were filtering away, drop by drop, through the little end of your heart. And, therefore, it was not Susan! Was it Anne?---I was puzzled, for a moment; I remembered how I used to lie upon the sofa with her; with my arms round her waist, for whole hours, of a warm twilight summer evening, without uttering a word, drawing a breath, or even daring, fool that I was! and barbarian too---to torture any creature so--- and a woman, of all creatures---to press my lips to her face. O, I knew little of women, then---but, I have grown wiser of late; tenderer of disposition. I could not be so cruel, now---I could not, to any thing, in the shape of a woman---living or dead---sick or well. Was it Anne? No; for, though I had felt one pang, one, that shot through me, like a poisoned arrow, when I had seen another, no more like me, than like—him— (that's better than Shakspeare's Hercules, I think, or Hamlet)---dwelt upon, with eyes full of tenderness; yet, there was no sweltering of the heart in it---that infallible indication of love, with me, where I have once been goaded and scorched by jealousy. Was it Harriot?—no—she had never cared a fig for me; and all my love for her had only gone to the extent of touching her hand, now and then, at back-gammon--articulating “my dear girl!” as if by accident; and once, poor creature, how her eyes glittered! putting my arm, by the merest casualty in all the world, round her beautiful waist, in a room full of people, who were crowding about the fire place, where we stood—so as to justifying her, in not appearing to feel it; but I saw the colour flash through her transparent forehead--and her sweet eyes twinkle, as if my naked arm had embraced her. Yet—alas, alas, it was not Harriot!— She had become a little too much of a woman, or rather, for I think I can amend that sentence, too much of a little woman. Was it Rachel?—I pause at that name. My heart stops. I cannot treat her irreverently. If ever woman loved man truly, that woman loved me so. Yet—fool that I was—idiot, madman that I was—I trifled with her affection—wrung it from her, by the most dastardly, shameful and unmanly trial; and then, reader, I do blush, and burn; and my eyes throb unpleasantly, now. I left her. Yes!—no woman, I am sure, ever loved man, more devotedly—more silently; or with a truer and holier regardlessness of self, than she loved me. I can see her, now—her deep, dear, passionate eyes, and unsteady complexion, (she was a brunette)—her hushed breathing; and mournful, yet tender voice, while she sat by me,—supported by my arm, of a long evening; in my own chamber too, drawing her problems in geometry, as I dictated them to her. I was her tutor; and, so sacred was the confidence that she placed in me—that, with every opportunity to destroy her,—I shuddered and quaked, even at the thought of embracing her. She was in danger, but she knew it not—in mortal peril, often, when our cheeks touched and thrilled; and I felt her smooth hair, blowing over my hot temples— yet, as I hope to see heaven; and you have no idea what a consolation there is in the thought—it is one bright spot—almost the only one of my whole life---I never profaned her, in thought, or word, or deed. Poor innocent; she knew not enough of my nature, or her own, to be thankful for it; but, day after day; night after night; went, in the holy purity of her heart; and sat and slept near a furnace, that might have consumed her—nay, that would have consumed her, as it hath many a wiser and more subtle one, but for that wonderful artlessness and purity, in her own heart, which kept her from even the thought of evil. Gracious heaen! Could I have put my hand profanely upon that girl! I know not—I cannot imagine it possible; and, to this hour, it would seem as natural for me to spoil an infant, with violence, as to put my lips, passionately, to that creature's mouth, or eye lids. Yet—I might; and, even then, in the delirium that would have followed, she would have felt nothing but the delicious certainty of being beloved. This was all that she sought for; and, when her soft cheek lay upon my bosom, and her beautiful eyes were upturned to mine, like molten jewelry, just so that I could see the light issuing from them, through the transparent lashes and lids; it was only that she was very happy in the belief of—she hardly knew what—but I know that it was pleasant to her, to be near one that she loved. Yet—I trifled with that girl. I sought to make her love me. I succeeded; and, though I neither sent her, bruised in spirit, broken in heart, nor dishonoured, to an untimely grave, yet do I fear mightily,—O, may it not be cast up to me, at the great day of account, for the sake of my forbearance—I do fear that her heart was widowed by me, for ever and ever, in mere wantonness? that I robbed her, of her peace, her power of loving, any other man: and left her incapable of blessing; another or, being beloved, for all the remainder of her weary and uncomfortable life. Bitterly do I repent of it—very bitterly: and wonder, now, that the witchery and delight of being loved, should so have made me, what no language can palliate—a villain; an unprincipled villain. Many years have passed away, since I left her. It may be, that she is not of this earth—it may be! If I were sure of it, I would drop upon my knees this moment, and pray to her to pardon me; and to intercede for me; wherever she is. Poor, dear Rachel! I had no justification—no excuse; yet I was never weary of humbling her. The manifestations of love, deep and delicate as they were—were never sufficiently convincing; and I would deliberately wring her with doubt; palsy her whole frame, with terrour (as I did once, under pretence of going out to fight a duel, when she fainted, and was very sick, sick unto death, till I returned)—and, in short, do every thing that an abandoned murderer of innocence, and love, could have done, except that of damning her, and trampling her under my feet. No—it was not Rachel. Too many years had gone by, for that. Nor Charlotte?—no, for though I felt prodigiously uneasy for awhile, to see her coquetting with all the world but me;—yet I had been too amply revenged at last by hearing from her own lips, that— “she would marry anybody—anybody”—looking at my Z ugly face, and speaking in a voice that thrilled through and through me—at the time, “that a certain man” (the warmest friend that I had on earth, and she knew it!) “would recommend to her”—to think of dying for her —in this way—no, no; I could'nt think of it. Well then, it must be Eliza: but which Eliza?---- there were at least three or four, who had, at some time or other, tugged at my wretched heart strings. First, there was Eliza H— a noble, elegant creature----(hair a little too auburn, though)--with a cultivated mind---but, unluckily, she had never cared a fig for me, till, in the course of much vicissitude, I had nearly lost all the natural sensibility that I first had;---beside, she had too pretty a sister, for a fellow to be downright in love with any of the family. By the way, it is, depend upon it, a confoundedly preplexing question sometimes, to carve for yourself, in a family of loveliness and grace. While you live, therefore, if there be more than one decent daughter in the family, where you are in love, take care to leave the door open, to back out at----till the last moment. There is no knowing what may happen.--- And there is no such misfortune for a family of girls, as to be all beautiful, and unmarried, about the same time. They are sure to wane, perish, die, of loneliness, and ill humour. If half of them were ugly as the devil; another quarter just passable; and the remainder unlike each other;---with only one beauty, the whole might get married at last. So, depend upon it, ladies, if there are many of you----marriageable----or, if you are not, and you all know when you are, better than I can tell you,----my advice to you is plainly this----to draw lots, fairly and honourably, and blow up all your faces with gunpowder----except one. But if that be too terrible---take the small pox. It is your only chance, believe me; and, a moment's reflection, will convince you, that there would be great policy in it. A little temporary neglect, it is true, would follow; but, you would be pretty sure to learn to read and spell--though you did'nt turn out your toes, as if you had the cramp, nor talk as if----Lord help me now, for a comparison! I am at a dead, pull—no matter. The contrast would be sure to set off your sister to greater advantage; the publick (especially the women) would soon see more beauty in the family, than ever; your unblemished one; and here, by the way, you will remember, if you are wise, to let her be the biggest natural fool among you, if there be any way of determining which that is----it will save her the trouble of lisping and laughing like an artificial simpleton; and nothing, I assure you, is half so captivating to the creatures that are called men, as this helplessness, when there is nothing but the difference in height--- none in the countenance at all ---to distinguish the woman from the babe, “muling and puling” in a ball room ----your unblemished one, particularly with these accomplishments, would be sure to get married off hand; because, her lovers would not be distracted in their devotion to her, by your faces; and then, you, if she have any family pride at all, will be got rid of, one after the other, among her husband's relations. In a few years, too—to comfort you for this temporary self denial, you will be, assuredly, the more agreeable of the two:--you will have mind, in that wintry season, when the personal beauty of all women is like the shadow that hath gone —something, that nobody will take the trouble to run after, even in thought. But—is this too severe? Then hide and disfigure yourselves, to the best of your power, if you are wise; and leave, as you hope to be married; nay, as you hope to be widows—only one of your number, at a time, out —for bait—at your doors and windows. If you prefer the gunpowder, there is this advantage in it, that you can take what quantity you please, so as to prevent the catastrophe of being, any two of you, of the same ugliness:---but then, the small pox will do the same thing, in its own way—no two of you will come out, alike, from the seaming and scarring----and now, one word in good faith—as you are living women, if there are more than two pretty ones in the same family, I do assure you, that you will all die old maids, if you do not follow my plan; and that a sensible, high minded man, will be the first to choose the gunpowder face,---when the heyday of his blood is over; and he wants a companion; a friend; a wife, for the fireside; and a mother for his children. But why do I mention this? Who of you would not rather be beautiful, than wise?----beloved by many fools, than by one great heart;--the mistress;[10] [10] Just now, I am thinking of one of our most celebrated women, who, it is said, once declared, that she would prefer being the mistress of a prince, than the wife of an honest man. She probably spoke the truth; and deserves to be—I will not say what.—Ed. the companion for dalliance--the —no matter what--anything that is base and sensual— the mere plaything of men, when they are upon a level with the brute beast. Pretty well! No, it was not that Eliza. Could it be Eliza S— a tall, romantick girl, so touched with theatrical romance, that, to carry her heart and soul by storm, it was only necessary to make love, like a man on horse-back; in armour and blank verse; to the sound of a trumpet: she whom, though I declare that she was a high minded and intelligent woman; of a warm and generous, temperant; anybody, with the name of Tekeli, or Octavian, could have run away with, off hand;---she who, the second time that she ever saw me, leaped, upon my honour, it is a fact,--from the top of the stairs, down to the bottom—sprang into my arms, and gave me such a kiss! by Jupiter! my lips are tingling yet,—no—it was not she—she is—poor girl, poor girl!—she was really an excellent creature—but, alas, she is married. I should like to see that woman again! upon my word, I should—in the presence of her husband and babes--- anywhere indeed, except at the foot of a long staircase----in a dark entry—with the street door open. No, it was not that Eliza. It would be impious, to imagine that all this fever and fuss, in my arteries, were owing to a married woman. Nor could it have been Eliza P—, that most affectionate of human hearts (for, at that time, “I had not learned to love”) and did not know her—she, whose raven tresses; and black glossy smiling eyes, for ever letting out the “delicious secret” of her passion. No, it was not she. But let me describe her. She was one of the only three really modest females, that I ever knew: and yet, were the women of the world, whom Byron distinguishes from the women of the town, by calling them, ladies of “un-easy virtue,” acquainted with all our dealing with each other, they would turn up their eyes at her modesty. Ah—how little they know of themselves! She, too, was virtuous; nay, she might have fallen, and been more virtuous, nevertheless, than many a woman, whose reputation is unimpeachable. Some preacher, I remember, once said that the difference between a virtuous and a fallen woman was, that the one had struggled, and the other had not.[11] [11] From Sterne.—Ed. It was a beautiful thought; and never was a thought more applicable to anybody—than this, to Eliza. Never was woman so tempted and tried—so secretly, incessantly, and so unwittingly. I deliberately practised upon her; inflamed her imagination; corrupted, or rather sought to corrupt her senses—memory and delicacy, by continual encroachment; and yet, I could not prevail. I do not say that I would have profited of her self abandonment, if she had yielded— for, I believe that I should not; but she did not know that, and she resisted me. Therefore, do I say, that she was, emphatically, a modest and virtuous woman--tried and weighed. Yet she was one of them that are full of contradiction—all that was noble and heroick, she could have endured—but nothing that was not so, for her love of me. But why should I complain? It is easier for any woman to lay down her life for her husband, than to drink brown sugar in her tea; or broil her own steaks. Still, there was one other; a little, round faced, cheerful-eyed girl, with a dash of smartness and piquancy that gave uncommon zest to her manner. Could it be she? All that I remembered, to justify me in thinking of her, at this time, was a little twisting and broiling of my inwards.† † Shameful literary poaching—borrowed, evidently, from Byron's, “They wrung her vitals with their fiery hands.” Ed. It happened once, on seeing her somewhat kind to a young dog, that came out from London with an apology in his mouth, for not bringing me a superb black dress, that I had ordered; and with the very same dress upon his own back, at the time—in which, like all your true blooded Englishmen, who are Z 2 disqualified at home, to shoot any thing but their friends and dunghill fowls—and, when they get to America, are as mad and foolish, as if they were made altogether squires and noblemen, under the qualification of our game laws; he was out, scouring all the swamps, and hedges, and ditches of the country, at the same time that I was coaxing off and on, the only suit of clothes that I had in the world, twice a day: and they were so thin that I dared not cough or sneeze, or make much of any kind of a noise in them; or go out in a high wind—lest I might have to run into some house on the road, and borrow something to come home in. Well—to return —it happened on one bloody cold night, when I was coming through a long street with her; at one end of which, lived a gentleman, with whom we had been starving and freezing for several hours—at the other— the North Pole, Iceland, Greenland, Lapland, Siberia and Spitzbergen; and just in the centre, a mischievous girl, who, when it was too cold to hang her own stockings out of the window for a signal, would put a black girl up to it; and be serenaded, by proxy—with the sweetest guitar in the world, and the tenderest, and truest of hearts—but thereby hangs a tale—I only know that she made a fellow serenade her window one night, till all his fingers, and toes were numb—with a guitar—and that I found out afterward; for I had a sneaking kindness just then, for the same creature, that she, who had appeared at the window, listening to his plaintive, sweet roundelay-ditty-izing, heedless of wind or weather, was a great greasy she-negro, blacker than ten thousand devils. Well, as I was coming through that street—with the aforesaid, (the last, aforesaid—I should say)—Eliza—I attempted to wrap her up in my cloak—the most comfortable thing in the world—for me—but, somehow or other, she “was'nt agreeable;” and, ever after that, we were on the most perfectly polite, gentlemanly, cold blooded footing, in the whole world. Are you tired, reader?—Can anything be more natural? Does'nt it remind you—for you know my aim----it is to write easily---(I wish that you could see my manuscript!) does'nt it remind you of— “You write with ease, to show your breeding— “But easy writing's damned hard reading.” No; it was neither of these Eliza's. There was but one more—a nameless girl; or, at least, one that was very near losing her name, one night. There was a camp meeting. I had heard a great deal of such things; and was all a tilt to get into one. I love religious people; particularly them that wear petticoats, and tumble, and roll about, in their extacies; and them, too—if they have sweet voices—that whoop, and halloo, and bawl, in their devotions; there is somewhat so reverential and composing—so august and dignified in it. So, attended by a friend, the guitar man, (since married—so no more of him—I never speak ill of the—married)I—rode to the place; hitched my poor mare (m-a-r-e, reader, or you may fancy, that I tied my own mother to a tree; for, in the fashionable world, mère, mayor, and mare, are all the same thing—in pronunciation, I mean;) to a tree; and left her to the mercy of the gad-flies, that had come to the same meeting; and, faith, they must have been troubled with extacies, too—for the poor creature was stung into a hard lump, when I found her in the morning—harness and all. We could hardly squeeze her into the shafts. This done, I went among the evangelical. By heaven—with all my levity—all my quick sense of the ridiculous—I found something too frightful, in these things, for my laughter. In one large booth, were a matter of forty or fifty people, if legs and arms were any indicia; men and women; sweltering and sprawling about, of a hot night; a fat man in the middle—a justice of the peace, whom I knew— jumping, and bawling, and shouting, until he had worked his shirt half out, over the waistband of his breeches; and two of his own daughters, amiable and modest women, who—it was a mercy that they were not, what they pretended to be—utterly transported out of their senses—a mercy, indeed, that the delicate instinct of modesty was not quite put out—who, whenever they had become, to a certain degree, exposed, by the flourishing and agitation of their own, or their neighbours limbs, fell to drawing up their feet— drawing in their horns—and adjusting their dresses; but without opening their eyes; losing their place; or stopping in their trance. In another, I found three or four stout, vulgar looking blackguards, playing with one of the most truly innocent and beautiful children, that I ever saw; shouting in her ear, all at the same time, till, in her terrour and agitation, her eyes waned, in their faint, spiritual blue, like the hushed azure of heaven, in dew and shadow—the colour fled—and the sweat stood, like rose-dew, upon her mild, sweet forehead; and this—this!—when they had plucked that child down to the earth! this was proclaimed, to the four winds of heaven, as another special manifestation of divine grace! O, my blood boiled in my veins. I thought of Susannah and the elders; and I was on the point of crying out, avaunt, ye accursed! But, just then—faith, it was musick to me—a pretty, little, rosy, dimpled country girl, passed me—with two or three companions. I followed her—and she nodded her pretty head at me, in scorn; but, after awhile, I persuaded her to separate from them, and walk with me. The enclosure was large; and, in the centre, was a circular place, boarded in with rough boards; benched with the same; and arched with the magnificent ceiling of God—the blue midnight. Who could spoil the innocent, in such a season, with such a witness? Not I. The poor girl was imprudent; but she was in the keeping of one, that never did, and never will, harm a woman, putting her trust in him. I led her to the centre of this boarded solitude. It was soon to become populous. It was the place of prayer; and the hour was close at hand. I avoided the darkness, though I sought the solitude; and we sat there, under the candle and starlight; and talked, lovingly, I own, but not wickedly, or licentiously, till the night dew had drenched her black hair. I observed it, and gave her my pocket handkerchief; but, hardly had she covered her head with it, than she started up, as if a serpent had been before her, and fled. At the same moment, two tall, stern looking men, Elders, stood before me. They began to rebuke me, as they would a school boy. I let them go on, patiently—very patiently—till I found that they were overheard; and then—O, may I never see—heaven, I was going to say —but that were impious, just now—so, I will even say, may I never see—the antipodes of heaven—if these men did not shake in their shoes, before I had done! Did'nt I give it to them? Did'nt I? What had they seen?— What heard? How knew they—uncharitable that they were—that I was not converting a sister, in my own way? I was. I would defy the whole of them, to bring tears into the eyes of a woman; or to make her humbler; sicker at the heart; more bruised and broken; or more sincerely penitent and ashamed—though I knew their power, well—with the same opportunity and time, than I, myself could. Nay, I would give them twenty-five, at that game. How dared they judge me? Who gave them authority? What had they seen, wrong? Where was the woman? Confront me with her. “I was disturbing their solemnities,” they said. Their solemnities!—tents full of legs and arms—for nothing else was to be seen; their hysterical sobbing and blasphemy—for nothing else was to be heard. And this was their religion! Why, the wild beasts have the same. They herd and howl together; the wolves troop; and carrion is hunted, with similar sounds; and, in much the same manner, that these creatures stoop at heaven—or upon their prey. It is only a natural sympathy. Armies are panick-struck, in the same way: one cries quarter; and all are cowards; another rushes to the breach; and the whole follow him. A man yawns; and all that are about him, follow the example; a woman weeps, or laughs; and a multitude, as at the theatre, do the same. Why? No living creature can tell. It is sympathy; that nervous, constitutional sympathy, which distorts your countenance, and sets you a stuttering, when you see another convulsed; or hear him stutter. And this—this, which the very animals hold in common with you—this,which the weak and foolish are most conspicuous for, is the divinity stirring within you! Impious, indeed! The good that you have done—ye followers of Wesley and Whitfield—is incalculable; and it ought to be incalculable, to counterbalance the atrocious profanation—the unutterable intemperance and dishonour—of your worship, at camp meetings. Have done with it—unless you would have your daughters annually regenerated; your sons hypocrites and religious scoundrels—the most damnable of all scoundrels, by the way. The good that are among you, and the wise, may be good and wise, any where;— but the licentious and wicked, can only he so, in a camp meeting;—there, lasciviousness is sanctified—indecency consecrated—and prodigal exposure becomes a commendable indifference to the world, the flesh, and the devil—vitally evangelical. Thus did I stand before these men—and, thus, did I question, and amaze them, until they were fain to let me depart in peace. But, what was I to do, for my pocket handkerchief? It was hard enough to part with that sweet girl; but it was the devil to lose the handkerchief. I put myself in Othello's place; and, had half a mind to stand up, and imprecate aloud, as I have seen an actor since—just as if I were choking at the waistbands—“The handkerchief!—the handkerchief!” My acquaintance had been short with that girl; but, I judged of her, by other women that I had known; and I felt sure, that she would be, to the full, as willing to see me, ugly as I was, as I should be, to see her.— So, I walked leisurely out, before my escort—whipped my hat round—elevated my shoulders—walked a little lame; and re-entered with them! After prowling awhile, I saw the flutter of a handkerchief. It was she!—it was she!—it was it!—it was it! I leaped toward it, as Sancho toward his ass—(mind your pronunciation.)— I had just time to squeeze her hand—look once, lovingly enough too, I confess, into her large eyes—and part for ever. No—it was not she. I turned over, in my bed. It would not do. Was there anybody else? No. I went over the whole list again. I had omitted some—some dear, sweet creature—fools; but, this whirling here— this uneasy, keen, yearning thirst, and cankering, as if I had been bled unsparingly, while I was asleep; this dark, dreary vacancy, and dissatisfaction. What was it? I could not answer; at least, when I slept, I could not. But when I awoke—women of heaven!—I was amazed and confounded, at my own blindness. In the night time, I had dreamt of Caroline—the child, Caroline; and of a young man—a very handsome young man, too—that I had seen with her, frequently, of late. I awoke!---all at once, I awoke, like one smitten to the heart, with a sharp knife. The secret was revealed. I was jealous;---sore---shivering with alternate cold and heat; and scorched, with the very air that I inhaled. Yes, yes! I loved again! That dream! By heaven, it were death to suffer it!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. Consequences...Cheating...Blankets....Shopkeepers...Hints to the Laity—Distrust...Dismay..Caroline...Passion...Revenge ...Ingenuity of Love...Hope...Superfine reflections. All the next day, I was strangely serious; melancholy, at times, and rather petulent. Every thing went wrong---I felt malicious---spiteful---struck one of the clerks---went into the retail store, and deliberately cheated a rascal, in the width of a cloth---and---stay, I must tell that. It was a neat thing, for a fellow in love to do; and may be a good lesson to the retail gentry, who darken their windows and doors, under pretence of showing their goods; dampen their cloths, that they may feel softer to the touch; show one end of a piece of goods, and sell the other; exhibit the coarsest stuff in the whole warehouse, first; though one should ask for mulled muslin, or Indian cambrick: dazzle your eyes with garish colours; and overwhelm your ears with counter gibberish—hurrying and confounding, teasing and talking you into purchases, that you never thought of making, and did know that you had made, till you found yourself at home, angry and ashamed of your own good nature, and of the rascal that made such a fool of you---your purse exhausted, yourself, or your husband in debt,---and your bundle made up of trash, that you have not the slightest recollection of having ever seen before!—so different do the qualities, and colours, and materials appear at home—when your mind is tranquil; the light, pure and strong; from what they did in a shop like a prison, and a noise that maddened you; to such men, this may be an additional lesson:—and to them that sell “damaged goods,” “cheap goods,” and “auction goods;”---or, are all the time “selling off,” their stock, at “reduced prices”—for, if you will believe them, altogether less than nothing; less than it cost to black the shoes of the importer; or grease the wheels of the manufactory; infinitely less, than the raw material cost in th eseed--- twenty generations back; to them too, that are wise enough, never to open a piece of linen---or, if they do, never to show any but the outside fold; who, when their white goods are smoked and yellow, always exhibit them, alongside of brilliant silks; and, when they show a piece of cambrick muslin, wet it, the agreeable creatures! with their own spittle, and draw it tightly over the tip end of the fore finger of the left hand; thereby making it appear at least one hundred per cent. better, than it really is;---or live by damaging goods, when the demand for damaged goods---and goods that have been shipwrecked---is at the highest; (for, such economy will rage, like madness, at times, among the women; whose maxim is, always to buy what is cheap, whether they want it or not; forgetful of the truth, that nothing is cheap which is not wanted; and who, when they have brought their husbands or fathers to the brink of bankruptcy, by their folly and extravagance, think to make it all up, and re-establish themselves for ever, as frugal housewives, by wearing a ruff once, that cost only a shilling---or, a calico frock, of a morning, that cost only a dollar--as if that were economy; that, which makes it necessary to renew the wardrobe of a woman, every morning; or, at least, every washing day)---to them, and all that profit by this folly, in the sweet creatures that rule over us---and take sound goods, untumbled, unstained, and unwet, and convert them, by a little simple legerdemain, into damaged and wet goods!---and so, vice versa---this will be of advantage. All these things are done. More than one fellow have I seen employed, in converting a piece of British book muslin, into an India book, by pulling and haling it about, in the water, till the starch was discharged; and, case after case of cambrick muslins, have I seen sold, when wringing wet; and tumbled all up in a heap; and trampled on; for higher prices, than they could have been sold for, in a merchantable shape---while every woman that bought of them, bought, as if she never expected to see another piece of cambrick muslin, upon the earth. And, after she was loaded with it, could be traced half Aa over town, by the trickling of bilge water, from it, on her way to exhibit her prize. By heaven! I have known women that have ruined their best friends, by the most shameful and profligate expenditure, absolutely beside themselves, at having bought a paper of pins, for half price---from some chap, who knew enough, not to give them away; for, there is no pleasure in bargaining adroitly there---women are not satisfied with that---they do not feel as if they have outwitted a man[12] [12] As if retail shopkeepers were men!—creatures, that live by trespassing upon the natural business of women.—No!—no!—the retail gentry of operas, are as much men—with less pretension.—Ed. then— while he cheated them in something, the price of which, they did not know. I am leaving the story; but, never mind—the rascals deserve it, and they shall have it--- now that I have left off trade! It is one of their maxims to sell to women—for, that saves advertising— cotton balls, pins, needles and tape, and such things, as all know the price of, at half price; but, tuck it on, say they, upon the cloths, linens, and such matters, of which they cannot so well judge. Women love to reason in a lump. If the needles are cheap, the cloths and linens are cheap, of course. There are some hundred more, beautiful and gentlemanly tricks, of the same kind; such as, always having a moveable price; and never refusing the last offer—selling by false invoices— giving old goods, new names—&amp;c. and always falling in your prices, before you are asked—or any complaint is made; having no change at hand, so as to oblige your customers to take toys—using short yardsticks— (which is rather perilous) and slipping back your thumb, while measuring;—cutting a piece of bandanna handkerchiefs, into eight, instead of seven;—selling India goods, by what they “came for,” and not by what they measure; making an assortment, out of one and the same piece, by cutting it up, and marking it at different prices—“ marking up” your calicoes, pins, cloths, &amp;c. and selling that which comes for 4-4, 5-4, 6-4, &amp;c. whether cottons or blankets, for one or two quarters more— that is, what is invoiced 4-4, for 5-4; and a blanket, that came for 12-4, for 14-4.—But, enough; you that do not know the things, do not understand the very alphabet of retailing; particularly in Cornhill, or Broadway, or Market street. And now, for the trick. It was rather a new one, as I take it. I found one of the lads confoundedly bothered, with a male customer, who kept running in and out, examining and re-examining; measuring and taking patterns of a cloth. (By the way, taking patterns, and samples, and shopping, is the common daily occupation, in decent weather, of nine women out of ten, in Boston and New York---who have no money to spend, or no heart to spend it.) I was fretted and indignant, at the puppyish complaisancy of the young men; and reproved them for it, sharply. At last, while the customer was yet balancing in his mind, between the cloth in “our store,” and that, which he had seen at the next door, I found that, the only question was about the width of the two. That he thought, should decide it; whichever was the widest, by a single thread, he determined to buy. I wanted to punish him, for the trouble that he had given to the boys; and knew no better, or safer way, than to do it, by cheating him—conscientiously, I mean. I gave him the yardstick, therefore; and begged him to go in, and satisfy himself. He soon returned; holding it so, that, our neighbour's cloth, it appeared, was a quarter of a yard wider than ours. It was, I found. 1 &amp; 5-8 wide; his thumb nail was upon the mark of the 3-8. A thought struck me; a pleasant one, I assure you. It was only taking the yardstick out of his hand, without appearing to turn it, and lo!—the width was converted, from 1, &amp; 5-8, to 1, &amp; 3-8!—It took---and he bought “our” cloth. I returned to the warehouse, in the same humour. Nothing seemed to work rightly. Goods had been sold, that were not packed; others were packed badly; and no invoices made. In this disordered state of my mind, and temper, (though I have the sweetest temper in the world,) a thick headed gentleman, regularly educated in an importing warehouse; one too, that was “not to be imposed upon, in the sterling cost of an article, by any body,” came to buy a bale of blankets. Our warehouse was full; and bought, at an extravagant price, on speculation. I showed them: but, the man was difficult to please —nothing would do, but the original cost---he must see that. I must measure them too. In the course of the conversation, I found that he had been looking at some of the very same blankets, in the warehouse, from which we had been supplied. I was vexed at his stupidity and affectation; and, merely to convince him that he could be cheated, with his eyes open, notwithstanding all his precaution, and wisdom, and experience, I cheated him. In the first place, I marked up the sterling cost of the whole bale, about twenty five per cent. I then advanced the blankets in the invoice 1-4, each pair, by marking them 7-4, for instance, that came for 6-4. I then took the man, to a sort of invoice book; and showed him the sterling cost---he was perfectly satisfied. I then led him into the cellar, and insisted on his measuring every blanket. He obeyed; and, as if there could be but one way of estimating them, I took their length alone; and thus demonstrated, that those which were called 9-4, actually measured more than two yards and a quarter, in length! Would it be believed, that this man; a regular bred merchant too, actually went away, and measured some of the same blankets; and compared them, with pen and ink; and then, came back, and bought ours---giving me nearly fifty per cent. more for them. Yet, it is true. This was all very well---very well indeed; but, I was not satisfied with it, nevertheless. It was too like the practice of advertising one hundred packages of goods, when you have but forty or fifty. Yet, it was the way of trade; and, people so well understand the trick; that, if a man should be scrupulously honest, and say that he had but forty or fifty packages to sell, they would believe that he had only ten or a dozen; so, if he should sell a piece of India goods, for just what it measured, in length; or call a piece of British goods 5-4, when it measured just that, it would be supposed, that the one was twenty five per cent. less than it was, in reality; and that the other was only 4-4, in truth. Thus, said I, to myself, a shopkeeper is obliged lie, in his own defence. Yet, this reasoning did not do, then. I had cheated, in the sight of heaven; and my heart smote me. I went home to my dinner, troubled. The afternoon passed away; and my seriousness was taken notice of; nay, something happened; I know not what, and I spoke to Caroline, the dear suffering Caroline, in a tone of bitter pleasantry; her eyes filled; and, had we been alone, I could have gone down on my knees to her, and kissed off the drops, if she would let me; but, there were others near; and, to conceal my perturbation, my tears even, for I wept a little; I was fain to appear very cheerful. But the exertion was painful; and, I was relapsing again, into thoughtfulness, and sternness, I believe, when, on looking at Caroline, I saw that she did not appear to observe it. I was about rising to depart—angry, to the very soul, with myself; and even having a slight, doubtful emotion of resentment, toward her—a wrathful swelling of the heart.— Could it be?—was I really so indifferent to her, that she knew not, and cared not, child that she was, whether I was in an evil or happy humour? I stood erect, with my hand upon the mantle-piece; and, just on the point of saying farewell, entirely, when Eunice, or mother, as I always called her, when I was happy, and at ease with myself, came near to me; and, laying her hand upon my shoulder, said, kindly, “William, what ails thee?” What could I say? My heart was in my mouth.--- The accents of reproof I could bear, for ever and ever; but not of kindness. No, no; I could not stand erect in the tender rebuke of eyes that loved me, even in their expostulation. I pressed her hand in silence. I could'nt speak. I was utterly unmanned. If I opened my mouth, I knew that the tears would follow; and that I might even sob aloud, before I knew it. Hezekiah had been very grave, all the evening. I saw it, and I knew the reason. He was displeased with me. This troubled my heart---but it offended my pride, also; and I scorned to be sensible of the change in his manner; but, at the sound of his wife's voice---he stopped---like one listening. There was no answer---he Aa 2 looked up in my face---and all his coldness gave way, instantly. “William,” said he, very kindly, “I am afraid thee is unwell. What has happened to thee?” He shook my hand as he spoke this, so cordially, that ---curse it---the tears did---did---not fall---nor filled my lids, perhaps, for I have always been ashamed to cry--- but they oozed out. I felt as if my eye-balls were bleeding, for a moment---and they smarted;---tears would have come; but---where was Caroline? I threw aside my eyes. She had moved---a very little; and, when I looked upon her, though her eyes were cast down, she attempted, just as if she felt that I was looking upon her, to regain the very same position and attitude. By heaven, it is wonderful, what little things will make our blood thrill sometimes. This trifle now, made mine leap, so that you could have seen it through my temples. Yet, she did not look up; and I was ashamed to be overcome, while she, so much younger and gentler, sat unmoved. Yet, I could not be gentle and collected; my resource was more violent. It was the repose of iron. I went to my room; but not to my sleep. Never did I pass such a night. I took out my own heart, and examined it; and, while I did, young serpents lanced out of it, in every direction. Strange thoughts—wicked thoughts—awoke. There was the pressure of revenge, like a strong hand, upon my forehead. And the thought of dominion, beat through all my arteries, like a broken current. I felt oddly about the head, too; and went and stood before the glass. I was appalled at the sight of my own visage. My flesh was livid; my lips ghastly; my teeth naked; my looks, those of one troubled in mind; and the clear blood, I could see, rippling over my forehead, as plainly as if the skin had been transparent. It looked dark, too— and melancholy; thick and turbid. I turned away, immediately. I was afraid to look any longer. I thought of that child, all night long. She had humbled me—cruelly, cruelly; and my thought was one that I dare not avow, even at this hour. “Will she love me?” said I, to myself. “Can I not make her love me? Aye, aye—I can. But how?— There were many ways, I knew well; but there was only one way, for her. It was to win her, by a lofty and imperious carriage; with, here and there, a dash of unpremeditated tenderness, that she might hope to be nourished with, if she should ever give herself up to me.” The next day passed over—the next—a whole week; and I was still in doubt. We were formal, and very particular in our manner. And here, I ought to mention, that Caroline had lately undergone a sort of transfiguration. Within a year—one single year—she had become a woman. Her tread; her tone; her manner:—they were no longer those of a child. To what should I attribute it? Her dress?—her age? No.— What then? To love? It was, undeniably, love. But for whom? I looked about me. I had never felt a thought of uneasiness before; yet now, when I ran over the young men that knew her; their beauty, and quality—and their exquisite humility, and good temper; and remembered my own haughty, cold, arrogant manner; how likely it was to intimidate such a girl; and how naturally a woman clings to what is lovely, rather than terrible, I confess, that I trembled. My heart grew fainter, and fainter—stopped; a sickening, death-like sensation followed. What was it? Mortified vanity?—aye. Jealousy?—yes; but jealousy in a new shape. Still, there were some involuntary movements about Caroline, that convinced me, at times, for a moment or two, that I was dear to her; a strange infatuation— mournful, but pleasant—followed. Why should I wound her? Why jar the sweet instrument, till it was tuneless, merely because it emitted no sound to my breathing? Perhaps it might be—like the harp of the air— only to be played upon by the sighing of heaven. A tear fell upon my hand. My heart was better. Then came a faint, delicate fluttering of hope. I remembered how, when we had set together, and our feet touched, accidentally, she had not withdrawn hers; and when my arm, as it lay upon her chair, had been, accidentally too, pressed upon her beautiful shoulder, as she leaned back; but then—O, no; it were idle to dream of such things. They were accidental. And then, too, when we stood upon the bridge, of a sweet moonlight evening, almost alone, with the blue water below it, rippling thinly over the round, innumerable, shining pebbles, like a flood of shattered starlight—and heaven, with all its beauty, came down upon us—that, as her arm lay upon mine—her hand, too; I had pressed my cheek to it, in leaning over the rail—yet, she had not withdrawn it. Nay, had we not embraced—all over, once—and there, too, upon that very bridge. Ah, Love! Love!—verily thou art a deceitful little devil. My whole life hath been a ramble, after thee. And then I would lie, and set traps for her, in my heart. “I will go to such a place to-morrow evening,” said I; “and she will be sure to go there. I know she will; because she cannot be happy, but with me.” I would go; but Caroline would not be there! “What kept her away?” I would ask myself. “Her sense of propriety? Her love? She could not be happy to meet me, as she must, before strangers, formally. She could not abide it. I must have a reconciliation. Well;— when shall it be? To-morrow; yes, to-morrow. She feels very tenderly, I am sure; and is deeply solicitous for an explanation. She will assuredly seek it. To-morrow, therefore, we shall be happy; and to-morrow night—O, heaven—I shall sit by her again, in the dim foliage over the water; and tell her all my meditation, just as it has been, during this long season of doubt and separation. She will smile then—dear Caroline—dear, dear Caroline!—and we shall agree then, never to fall out, while we have breath in us, without a full understanding upon the subject.” And then, I would go to sleep—sleep quietly—and dream of Caroline. The next day came; and, contrary to all my expectations, instead of seeking an opportunity for an explanation, I found her avoiding it, with a delicate, but incessant solitude. A new pang! It must be, that she did not love me; that I had been cheating myself, all the while; that he foresaw my purpose, and would defeat it; spare me the mortification of—of—the devil!— I am choking! What hath she done? What said?— Nothing!---nothing! She does not love me. Nay, more; suppose that she should tell me so? What could I say? Can I complain? Shall I call her a coquette?---and for what? Because she looked, and spoke to me, as to other men? A coquette?---thus it is. He, whose own vanity hath led him to the precipice, is the first to charge the woman with it; merely because she had the humanity to treat him with a refuse smile, now and then. This was not to be born. But, might it not be? Was it not possible to explain this conduct of hers by a more soothing hypothesis? Suppose that she really loved me, passionately, devoutly? What else could she have done to me, than she had done, of late? Would she not avoid me? She would. The conclusion was irresistible.— It was like musick to the deaf man, when his ears are first unstopped; the touch of soft lips, to a bruised heart. Thus are we the sport of our imagination. I remember once, when Caroline wore her hair in a particular way, which I had praised a long time before, that I felt flattered by it, and told her so. She did'nt appear to understand me; and I had the mortification to find that she had forgotten it entirely. Yet, hardly was I in my own bed, and alone, (I always sleep alone, in my own bed,[13] [13] Wordsworth.—Ed. ) than I contrived to imagine a theory, infinitely more delightful, out of this very reply. I persuaded myself that, forgetful of the source, she had learnt to love that fashion of wearing her hair, solely because I had once recommended it, and had followed it, long and long after, from the choice of her own heart, without recollecting the original source of that choice! Yes, that was it. She was too delicate; too bashful, by far, to pay me so direct a compliment.† † This brings to my recollection, a dear girl that I once knew, who had a voice like a bird, though abundantly more powerful. I loved her She loved me. Something happened, however, to make me doubtful of her love. During that time of doubt, I saw proof in every thing, to convince me that she no longer loved me. By and by, a new turn of thought came to me. I would delight myself continually in following her, and in anticipating her conduct; and, yet, although she did not act, once in twenty times, according to my expectation, yet I never changed my opinion. Thus, I would go to church, to hear her sing. I would say to myself “she will not sing to-night. I shall know the reason. She cannot. She will behold me, and she will feel too much emotion.” I would go. I would see her sitting as usual, with the choir—she would sing—I would see her, and hear her. `Ah!” I would say to myself, “how wisely she has behaved! Every body knows here, that she has loved me; every body sees me here; and everybody, as she well knows, will attribute her refusal to sing—to her emotion and inability, on account of her love for me. What self command! What prudence!” I would continually exclaim. But, after awhile, she would falter—her self-command would vanish—she would tremble and lean against a pillar, for support. “Heaven and earth!” my heart would cry out, “what affection! she cannot command herself.” How tender and true, after all.” So it is with all the world. And once. I particularly remember, that I went to a certain other church, where we had long been in the habit of seeing each other— in the belief that I would not be there; for, I had long left it; and I had been told that she had left it, soon after. I went, that I might be satisfied; for, how could I doubt her love, if that were true?—I went; and, the first person that I saw, was herself! Did this alarm me? No—it was but a higher proof of her love, yet!—What! did she not continue to go, notwithstanding I had left it, in the faint hope, (for, it was her only chance,—I went to another church;) of meeting me, one day or other, again; what patience!—what love! You may laugh at these things, reader—but, if you have a heart, be you man or woman, you have cheated yourself as beautifully, when in hope; and more cruelly, by far, when in fear.—En. And once, too, I remember, when I had given Caroline, herself, a pretty quaker-coloured shawl, she had worn it for some time—and I had been not a little pleased by her wearing it; but she left it off, finally, and then I was more pleased; for it was a proof to me, that she began to be sensible of appearances, and alive to many things, that, in the heedlessness of childhood, with an untouched heart, she had laughed at—or never thought of, at all. Yet, soon after, the shawl re-appeared, and I saw in it, a new proof of her affection, which made her diregard appearances. Thus it is, when we hope; every thing gives confirmation to our hope. And when we fear, all that may happen, is wrested and distorted to our purpose. Happen what will, there is sure to be an appositeness in it---as to the events that follow a dream, or an omen. When the heart is light, the whole world about, is an atmosphere of sunshine--- the heaven, a vault of molten sapphire---dropped with fire; but, when it is heavy---O, there is an unutterable dullness, even in the melody of birds; the sweet star-light; the green turf; and even the eyes of woman, are misty and afar---like what we worship in distraction---dim and uncertain, but beautiful, very beautiful apparitions; but, let me leave this chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. Male coquetry...Counsel...Delusions of love...Cases pro. and con....Confidence shaken...A stranger...Separation...Caroline's note...Miss A,...Modesty...Matters and things in general. Lady! Have you thought of what I said?—I left off, too abruptly in the last chapter. And you, sir, have you never gone to church, or into some company, where she, that you loved, was sure to be found?---prepared yourself for the trial---met her----and trembled?---approached her, and froze her and yourself too, with your own self collectedness; stood near her, and talked with all your heart and soul, about what you did not care one fig for, merely to astonish her; or to prove that you had not lost your self possession?---while you knew that your voice went to her heart?---I have. Have you never lavished your attention upon them, that she, whom you loved yet, more than all that lived and breathed upon the earth, might not sleep so very sweetly, in the coming night?----If you have, you are a scoundrel and a fool. I have Have you never put your head upon the pillow----after you had thought, till your temples were sore; and felt as if, even the pillow, were a truss of iron---as your conscience awoke, and whispered to you, in the darkness, to come to judgment!--and Love, the “naked new born babe”—with blue eyes running away, in water---sat by you, clinging to your agitated heart with his little hot lips?--I have. Have you never attempted to find some heroick, great reason for your cruelty and feebleness? and, at last, persuaded yourself, that the kindest thing in all this world, which you could do to the torn plant, that you had reft of all its blossoms; the gentle creature, whom you had visited like a mortal poison---was to leave them both, for ever and ever: and that the one, might be bound up; at another season might flower again, with its fragrant waxen blossoms; and the other, if it were utterly neglected, and left to the merciless wind, might soon be healed?—I have—I have persuaded myself that the truest evidence of love, which I could give to a woman, when we were apart for ever—was not to exasperate her, nor to pursue her; but when my heart was sweltering with a sense of her proximity, and all its tenderness wrought within it, like subterranean waters, all striving to gush out, in their feeling of blessedness—as if I knew not, that such a woman lived upon this earth: and why? Her wounded pride, I said to myself, will restore her; and she will be driven to look about her for another; some other, that may be permanently dear to her. We cannot meet again! Why should I seek to preserve my place in her love? It will only make her wretched; and disqualify her, for ever, for being happy with another. Thus did I reason, many a time and oft, when I was weary of living, and ready to bury myself alive, for the woman of my heart. It was her happiness—hers alone, that I cared for. It mattered little, to me—very little, how it was promoted. Would my life make her happier—I would live: my death?—O, I would lie down, willingly, and wait there, till my ashes were all that was left of me. And yet-what a fearful spirit of contradiction and vicissitude is this! I have set by her—very near her, too; when Hope started up, all at once, before me, like a new fledged cherub, with the wings of a butterfly. She was mute. “It is in awe,” thought I—“the words would die away upon her lips; love is making musick in her heart tho'.” But she spoke! where then was her awe?—“O, that was an effort to conceal it—it was a proof of her wisdom.” But she wandered, and was disordered in her thought; and her words were not very beautifully arranged. A sure symptom to me, that she was disordered where I most wished her to be; that she was not, with all her effort, entirely mistress of herself. Alas!—even this delusion perished with the other. Her manner became more steady; she was fluent and firm in her utterance—nay, even eloquent, and very feeling. “The inspiration of love!” I was sure—“nothing else could have done it.” Had I ever seen her so ready to manifest her power; and yet, so apparently unconscious of it? never. It was done then; either intentionally, to captivate me, and to demonstrate that she could be at ease, even with me; or unintentionally, which was yet more flattering!” But her voice trembled—her argument faltered. “Love, almighty love?” thought I. “She cannot get on, nature will triumph—hath triumphed.” But, she remembered herself almost immediately. “Gracious heaven! what a mind! what self possession!” I exclaimed, inwardly. She smiled—“it was a smile of encouragment.” She was pensive—“it is the sweet melancholy of love.'— She laughed; “it was only a natural effort to conceal her emotion.”—She was serious—“how could she be otherwise, with one so dear to her, in the same room!” Her seriousness went away; and I was delighted with her playfulness. “It was the hilarity of innocence; the festivity of the blessed!” Her hand touched mine— “it thrilled. I was sure that it had happened designedly. She had sought it—for the pleasure of touching me!” But mine touched hers; and she withdrew it, perhaps, just as if a serpent had fallen on it. “The electricity of love!”—I thought. “She could not abide it; her very blood could not, unpreparedly!” But, it may be, that she did not so suddenly snatch it away—but only withdrew it, coldly. “It was an artificial manner, the properest in the world, to disguise her real feelings.” She trifled with me—“it was an evidence that my nearness did not distress her; that she was happy in my company.” She was reserved—“it was impossible for one much in love, I knew, to trifle.” She listened to me, without opening her lips, or lifting her eyes. “How truly was she devoted to me!”—but, anon, she did lift her eyes, and join freely in the conversation. Still, there were comfort and sustenance to my B b love—happen what would! How ingenious we are, in deluding ourselves!—how wonderfully so, in torturing others. I have experienced both. In love—at one time, nothing could happen, nothing; that did not yield aliment to my hope. At another, nothing, that did not give nutriment to my fear. In the first place, I was sure that I deserved to be happy; and, in the latter, that I did not. Women are yet more ingenious; especially in their sorrow. Do their husbands watch every movement and tone—“it is” (if the devil Jealousy, or Distrust be once awake) “to conceal the alteration of their hearts—to Iull their once beloved one—in compassion.” Are they not so very attentive?—“they are neglectful.” Does the husband fail in an engagement?—“it is what he would never have done, before they were married; no never, never!” Does he keep it scrupulously?—“It is affectation; done to blind her; or treating her, like a spoilt child, rather than a rational companion; or done, less out of tenderness, for her; than out of a holy regard for his own word.” Do I speak bitterly? I feel it—I feel it! I have loved—been beloved—had an angel for my wife—yet such was her temper. My days were sunless, my nights—O, I would not that my worst enemy should be worn away, by such inward watching, as I have been, while my own Emma lay upon my arm—the lamp shining upon her parted lips, all night long—when, if I moved---she awoke, and clung to me; and trembled, and wept, as if she were truly about to lose me, for ever! No----no---not yet, not yet. There is time enough for all that. My boyhood is not yet told. That over, I shall be at liberty to tell what a father and a husband both suffered, who loved truly, tenderly, faithfully; yet doubted, all but the innocence of his own wife; and was doubted in turn even, it may be, of his own innocence. But Caroline—let me return to her. Our reserve, with occasional lapses of tenderness, had continued for nearly a year more; and I was already preparing, to return to my home, with the intention of going to the East Indies, as an adventurer. But a cloud was gathering, upon the face, that I most loved; there was a growing melancholy, and sorrow; and one evening that we were alone, Hezekiah told me, evidently with some unwillingness, that he had lately met with a very extraordinary man, from my country, who knew me. As he said this, he fixed his old eyes upon me---and, I could see that there was something wrong in them. I coloured---not with guilt, but with surprise---and, perhaps, with a little anger. “Of what name?” said I, in a trembling voice. “I cannot remember it. It was accidentally that I met him. And, when I learnt where he was from, I happened to mention thy name. And he told me much of thee.” “Unfavourable, I am sure,” said I, haughtily. “Yes---” answered the old man. I was thunderstruck. I arose from my seat. “Where is he to be found?” said I. “I must see him.” “Be calm, William. He has promised to meet thee; and he will keep his promise. When we are together, face to face, I shall confront him with thee. Till then, let us say no more about it.” I bowed; and, taking a candle from the mantle piece, was about to light it. “To bed William, so early?” said Hezekiah. “No—” said I. “Not to bed—to my room, only. I have matters there, that shall be no longer neglected.” “I shall see thee, tomorrow?” said Hezekiah, in a doubtful, and far less cordial tone, than usual. What could it mean! I turned pale. I felt that I was sinking. It was a small room; and, in going out, I should have to pass Caroline, who sat fronting me. I attempted it; but, I thought that I should never get to her—never! It was like running in my sleep, with a murderer after me. She lifted her face. She was pale as death; and, I am sure,—aye, perfectly sure, that she had been weeping. Hezekiah arose. “William,” said he, with a manner, unlike aught that I had ever seen before in him— I could not have believed him capable of such great dignity—and Caroline, as if dreading, I know not what, appeared about to leave us. “No, my child,” said the old man, “thee may abide here yet. I have no secret from thee. Thy old father cannot begin now, to cover his heart, before his only daughter. No, Caroline—stay thee here. Tomorrow evening will he the evening of trial. Till then, we ought to suspend our judgment. In the mean time, I have only one word to say to thee, William. I have trusted thee—I have heard thy story; watched over thee; taken thee, as my own child, into my own family. I cannot believe that thou wilt abuse my confidence. I—.” “Abuse your confidence!”—said I, as soon as I could draw my breath. What is the meaning of this?—Speak! Who has dared to slander me? What have I done? Bring me, face to face, with the wretch, that has visited you—let me but face him, and I will trample him in the dust.—I—.” “Would that prove thy innocence?” said Hezekiah. O, I thought that my heart would burst. I turned again, to go. “Thee will surely meet him?” said the old man, rather doubtfully. “Meet him,” said Caroline, “meet him! O, that he will.” The words, I heard not—I know not how they reached me—there was no sound, no look—but, the next thing that I knew, I was holding her to my bosom—my lips to her eye-lids; and my heart gushing out, all over. I recollected myself. I blushed and stammered, for a moment;—then, I went to the father; and I placed my hands, one upon each shoulder. “I know not what you suspect;—I care not,” said I. “You may believe that I will destroy myself. I shall not. You may believe that I will run away. Your change of colour shows that you do. I shall not. You may believe that I dare not meet him. You are mistaken. You are an old man—a man of much experience. Yet, you do not know my heart so well as that child. She will tell you—she did tell you, that I shall meet this stranger—whoever, or whatever he may be. You have doubted me.—Enough.—It does not cancel all my obligation—but—(my voice trembled)— but, it has done no little, toward discouraging me, in the way of virtue, self denial; and—(love, I would have said, but I could not.) You are moved. It is too late. Tomorrow night, I shall meet that man. He can tell you nothing, if he tell the truth, so bad as I have already told you, of myself. Some particulars, he may tell you. I would have told you the same—nay, some that he cannot tell—some, that no other beings, than God and his angels, are acquainted with. I have used no concealment. I have acknowledged that there was blood upon my hands, and blackness in my heart: but, I have never sought, and never avoided, with any especial care, to distress you with the particulars. Would that you had done more wisely. It is terrible to—to— to part, now—I—I—.” “To part!”—said Hezekiah—catching my hands— “To part!”—whispered Caroline, raising her head from the table—“to—to part!”— Her voice died away, in a low murmur. “To part!”—said I, firmly. “There is no help for it, now. I have foretold this. I have cautioned you against it, again and again. For three whole years, have I said, “beware how you doubt me; come to me, if you would know anything; and you shall know it all, all, even to the most secret transgression of my thought. But do not doubt me.—I did not say why. I could not, then. But, now I do. It is no longer safe for us to meet together. One, or the other, would soon perish. You have discouraged me. You have taught me, that there is no hope for me. Happen what will! years of self denial may have worn away! years of contrition, sorrow and perseverance!—yet, my character is gone—my hold upon your heart is gone—in the very first breath of a stranger—an unknown man—a—. No matter. Tomorrow night, I shall meet him. Farewell. Till then, I shall not leave my room That over—that—it is hard to think of—but, it must be —farewell, to you all, for ever!” “I shall never forget your love, or your respect; nor, will you, yours, for me. I will compel you to respect me; all of you; all that know me; all that have known me; Bb 2 with all my infirmity, and wickedness, to the last hour of my life!” Eunice had entered, unperceived. She held her handkerchief up to her face—and tried, many times, to speak—but, could not. I turned to Caroline—while her father and mother sat down. in two rocking chairs, near each other, and turned their faces away; each, holding by the other's hand. They knew me. They already knew enough of me, to feel that there was no hope left. They were inconsolable—utterly—and speechless. I went to Caroline. I took her hands. She leaned her forehead upon my arm; while I stood up, and held her as she sat. It was some minutes, before I could utter a word—and then, all my heart ran out, at my lips and eyes. “Caroline!”—said I—“speak to your mother—to your father. Tell them that I am innocent. I know not what may have troubled them—what they may have heard; some thought of you, or me, perhaps—but, speak to them. Tell them that I am innocent. Tell them that. till this hour, and in their presence—my lips never touched thee—my arm never embraced thee. Thou art the child of their old age, Caroline; and, when I am away—O, do not weep so bitterly—do not—when there is none left, to do me justice, there is one, one, I am sure, whom I have mightily wronged, that will do it. Wilt thou not, Caroline? (Her hand contracted, convulsively—and mine was drenched with her tears; and her lips,—oh, I can feel them yet, upon it!)— Wilt thou forget and forgive me?—Farewell!—Thou shalt have no cause to repent of thy—thy—. No, dear, I will not, cannot say it. Farewell.” I took her up in my arms, as I said this—she was lifeless—and laid her upon the bosom of her mother. I never saw her there, afterward, till she was upon her death bed. What a night, I passed! More than half of it was upon my knees. What!—and was there no peace for me? none, till the cold grave had hut over me? Were the follies of my boyhood—the nameless things, that I had done, and told—and repented of—were they to haunt me, eternally? and interpose, like apparitions, just when I was nearest to being happy! Was this the retribution of heaven? Had my conscience slumbered? O, I knew not. But, I knew this—this: and it was a comfort to me, that God hath entrusted the happiness of man to his own keeping. That night, I reviewed my conduct. I thought, of all that I had said, or done, in that family of love. There were many foolish things; some indiscretions; some childish and hasty things, for which I was sorry, and had atoned; but none, no— not one, of wickedness! This then, I was sure, would preserve me, in their veneration, when I was gone. They would try to forget me; but, they could not. All that was good in my nature, would be embalmed in their hearts. All that was evil, would be forgotten, or thought less unkindly of. I had parted with her too— parted—God of heaven! can it be true!—parted!— and with whom?—with Caroline—and for ever! And how? My heart smote me. But, my pride arose, like Lucifer, the jewels melting upon his forehead; and, with that regal aspect, which hath ever characterised it, took the attitude of dominion anew. I would sacrifice my life for Caroline—but, not my self respect. No—we were apart. And how? Just as it should be. We had parted at night; in tears—the first kiss of love, upon our young lips;—the first fever of passion in our young veins—and, all the night long, she would lie, and meditate and dream about it— with all the night through, and darkness, solitude and silence, for the impression to deepen itself! Would she ever forgive me?—No— never—never! I would leave a farewell letter for her. She would preserve it; and hereafter go to it, all alone; and sit by it; and weep over it, as over some precious thing inurned; and, every year, there would be a holier tenderness in her thought of me. I would leave, as I always do, the truth of my heart before her;—and my last words should be what all her future experience would confirm. I did so. I sat down, and wrote her a letter, that had she lived to this hour, she would have loved me for having written. But who was the stranger?—Did he really know me; and dare to say these things? No—it was impossible. It must be some one, who did not know me: some one, who had heard a report only of my evil nature, and believed it, from its generality. Could I blame him?—No. But he was upon ticklish ground. A false step might dash him to atoms. I made up my mind immediately. “If he be malicious and meddlesome; or a liar, I will make an example of him, upon the spot,” said I. “But, if he be truly a friend of this family, repeating only what he has heard, —and I can tell that by his forehead and eyes, while he is repeating it, I will forgive him.” Early in the morning, some one tapped at my door. A note was given to me. I opened it—it fell from my hand. It was the writing of Caroline herself. My glance ran hurriedly over the first sentence—the first, only—and I was like one struck blind. It was some minutes before I could command myself. Never, never, in all my life, did I feel so sudden and deadly a chill at my heart—as at that moment. It seemed to stop all at once, with a sudden jar. A sort of giddy, rushing, sensation in my head—and then, a strange faintness followed. That Caroline should write to me— Caroline, whose timidity was so spiritual and delicately interwoven with her very thought, that—O, it was past belief! Once only, had I seen the trace of her pencil before. It was accidental. I had given her a little book, of exceeding value to me, as the gift of a friend, but I had given it to her delicately; and she had misunderstood it as a loan. Some time after, she returned it to me—in such a way, that—O, it were idle to tell how my heart heaved. It had been so happy, so very happy, till that moment—and that—the cup was dashed with poison, at the very instant when my lips were burning with the first taste of it. I was mute, disordered, haughty and absent—unable to maintain a conversation with anybody, yet, too proud to yield forgetting myself every moment, yet constantly, and earnestly mingling in all that was said—I left the room. I opened the book, at a folded leaf, a single line was underscored—it was in her hand. I knew it —I felt it—as if it had been scored upon my heart. A single word too, was there—O, how much it told of what she thought. But this! I took up the note again. It ran thus.— “I have made several attempts to tell you candidly, the exact state of my feeling, but find it impossible.” This was the sentence that shook me—down to the dust. I had parted, and wept and prayed—upheld, by the certainty that I was beloved. Yet, at the very first glance. I foresaw, in this note, that I had been deceiving myself. It was unmanly to yield. I took up the paper again. I read it. It was very cautious—but why is it, that love will be heard! buried, darkened and mute. It is but a buried exhalation—buried, and heaped up embers—and that inward musick. which, but touch the earth, where they are hidden, and they all come out anew, in their agitation, fragrance, warmth and melody! The note continued—after this fashion. “Therefore, contrary to my resolution, which you, so often, have heard me express, I am compelled to put my thought on paper. I hope that you will pardon me. I think that you entirely deceive yourself respecting Miss A—.” (Stay. reader—Here is something untold, I find—a tale of sorrow and of—shame. Be patient a while, and I will tell it.) “I think (that) you love her; indeed, I am sure (that) you do.” “I think—that, perhaps, some of my friends have persuaded you into a belief, that I am more worthy of your affection, than I really am. I do not think that you have known me long enough, to judge of my character. I never, never would consent to marry any one, unless I were sure that I possessed his undivided HEART. If God spare me my dear father, his society with the love that I have for study, will, in some measure, compensate me for the attention of a kind and affectionate husband.”[14] [14] Do not smile reader. I cannot bear it. It would pain me to know, that a blunder, so innocent and natural, in a sweet unpractised girl, and no professional author, should be ever seen. But, I cannot alter it—it is too sacred in my eyes. And who does not understand her meaning—that the want of an affectionate husband's attention, and not the attention itself, will be compensated here? You have loved several, as ardently as you now think (that) you love me. On analyzing my character, I am sure (that) you will discover some things, (that) you cannot like. I have not that strength of mind, which I have so often heard you admire. I have consulted no one upon this subject, not even my parents. They attribute my seriousness to indisposition—let them think so. I am really sick. I beg of you, as a proof of your friendship for me---do not, by your conduct, lead them to suppose (that) anything unpleasant has passed between us. I feel that I am doing wrong in writing, without the consent of my parents. If I were to ask them, I should have to give my reason for acting so. I cannot do that. I find it impossible for me to speak to you; and it is necessary that you should know my true sentiments.” (Here my pulse stopped again—the letter was a riddle to me. What did it mean?—I could not understand it; and yet, the allusions were plain enough.— But here I was palsied anew—as if death had put his hand upon my heart, once more, in sport—I could feel it rotting away under his touch—but it was only for a moment.) “Continue to treat me, as usual, until after my father goes to L—: then I can write to him. what it would be difficult for me to tell him—my determination of never marrying. He shall, by my representation, believe it is from the love of my study---adieu!—If tomorrow be pleasant, will you walk with us?—may heaven bless you!—C.” Tomorrow!—walk with her!—what is the meaning of all this? am I mad? or am I deceived? Can it be her writing, or, it may be, that she is trifling with me— does she think me such an idiot, as to walk with her tomorrow, after what has happened to night. O, no—I would not exchange the sweet recollection of that parting, for all the rapture of possession! I threw my eyes upon the date. Gracious Heaven! could it be possible!—they danced in their sockets. The paper was a week old. I rung the bell violently and, when the pasteboard humpkin who gave it to me, appeared, asked him, as composedly as I could, when he received it. “He could not rightly tell,” he said, holding his quaker arms down, stiffly by his side, with the palms nearly turned wrongside out; and not a pucker in his face, the rascal! “may be a week”—may be ten days—may be—” “Hell and the devil!” said I. “Oh my!”—said the stupid dolt—wiping his lips with his great paws, and staring at me, as if he had not “rightly understood me.” Why did not you give it to me, directly? “Why, I lost it,” he answered, with the same imperturble gravity, “I gived it to thee, as soon as I found it agin.” What could I say to the Jackass? “Begone—dolt.” I sat down and thought. “Here then,” said I, “is the riddle explained. Here then, is the cause of her last seriousness and sickness. What must she have thought of my silence? Tomorrow! when was it?—I began to recall the time, and found that she had been particularly troubled and silent a day or two, probably, after the letter had been written; and then, rather haughty. It was all explained now. I sat down and wrote a few lines, ending, if I remember right, somewhat in this way, “and now, farewell, farewell, forever, Caroline. May you meet with some one, whom you may love with all your heart and soul; some one having all of my good qualities, and none of my bad ones; and one too, that has always been what man ought to be.” The day wore away very gloomily. I had secured my passage in the evening stage; my trunks were all packed, and the hour of trial was fast at hand. Still there was a continual, deep yearning, and sorrow here, for Caroline. I felt that it would nearly break my own heart to leave her, and yet, I never would consent to marry any woman whose father had doubted me. And she too, had she not doubted me? where then would be my safety, were I to marry her? nothing would be left to me, nothing but to see—O God, have I not seen it!—the mother of my babe dying, day by day, of a broken heart, with the same malady of doubt and death! And here, one word of Miss A—. I had been once, in New Haven, and, while waiting for the steam boat to arrive, I sallied out, to take a bath. The Museum and bathing house were under the same roof. No. I am mistaken—in part—my memory is bad of late; but this I do remember, that I left the tavern to go into a bath, and that I came home without having been in it, and with having been in the Museum. At the Museum, I met with two women, accompanied by a country bean, strangers; one of whom had something particularly striking in her manners, and pleasant in her voice. I tried to get an opportunity of speaking to her; and, as people in these small towns are not very scrupulous, (in private) with strangers—I succeeded. After paying her some little attention, we separated. and I passed rather an uneasy night; for really, there never was a more inflammable nature than mine; and thought a good deal of her, wishing, all the while, that I could manage to delay my journey a day or two, and find her out. But no—that was impossible. I was travelling by express, as I always have been, all my life, and always shall be, to the devil, I dare say, through all eternity—at least. Hardly had I set my foot into the cabin of the steam boat, the next morning, than I encountered these two identical ladies! I was delighted, as you may readily believe. The father, of this one, was with her; and the other, a black-eyed, saucy little wretch. with more mischief in her heart than you would think her whole body could well hold, stuck to her side, like a plaster of burgundy pitch, for the same purpose too, I imagine; to strengthen her. All went on very pleasantly, very—for I had the pleasure of hearing Miss A. (I had found out her name) abuse one of my most particular friends. for a whole hour; and then we talked about novels, plays, poems, &amp;c. &amp;c. of all which, I was just about as well qualified to talk, as the Cham of Tartary; and she, perhaps, not quite so well as I. But no matter for that: we talked and talked, till we were perfectly satisfied with ourselves, and tolerably, with each other. But the father was a shrewd, hard-looking, sour, thin man; and he had kept his eyes upon me, with a marvellous steadiness for a long time, not permitting me to approach his daughter's jewelry when he was near. without a good deal of management: and when we arrived at New York, he honoured me with one of the civillest hints in the world that, his daughter could do very well; very well, indeed, without any more attention from me. I remonstrated—He was her father, to be sure, but, I informed him that he was old and tired of the city! and this was her first visit—that there were ten thousand things to be seen—the lions and fish— and lawyers and mayor, and Dr. Mitchell, “and so forth,” and that it would worry him to death, to gad about with a young frolicksome girl—that, to me, it was all—. But the old fellow interrupted me—He “knew a few,” and not a very few neither; and if my modesty would have permitted me to interpret his looks into language, when I had finished my speech, my notion is, that they would have stood about thus, on paper, “Why, rot me, if thou art not the very otto of impudence.” It was in vain to parley with such a man. He was one of the cast-iron creatures of our revolution, who having been in many battles, like some of our mud forts, had caught their trick, of growing stronger and more impenetrable by bullet and ball. A smart cannonade of half an hour, was worth a new line of entrenchments to either. So—(we were at the house then,) he was holding the door open, for me to go out—I bid him a most reverential good morning, and vanished. He soon followed me; and I re-entered; after having led him out of the way; took his daughter under my arm, and—did'nt we have a pleasant time. By Jupiter; you would have thought us surveyors or tax gatherers;—we were to be found in every lane and alley in the city; and Cc were returning, the happiest of God's creatures, I verily believe, when—. Oh, the devil!—there was the old man himself—the old One, I ought to say. It was just at a corner. I crossed myself, and prepared for a somerset: and he, as if doubting the evidence of all his own, dear old senses, stood staring at her awhile—and then, as if he were afraid, if he did'nt secure her then, that I should get her, in spite of his gums—(for he had no teeth,) he hustled her under his arm—growled at me, like an old mastiff, upon whose tail somebody had trodden, at his own fire place; and set off, at a square trot. I never saw the woman after that. My acquaintance with her was a pleasant one, but entirely innocent; yet, somehow or other, the story of it had reached me again, blackened and distorted most shamefully: so indeed, that I felt no little sorrow and remorse for what I had done. I had told Caroline of it; but, rather as a frolick, than as a more serious matter; yet she, still apprehensive that there was something in it yet untold —had thought of it so much, that, at the very name of Miss A—, she would actually turn pale. That was all—all, upon my honour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. If you ever see a man sewing on a button, with a gimblet and codline; or cutting a hole in his waistband; and thrusting a tenpenny nail through the eye of the button, set him down for a Tailor.—Depend upon it, men are never so superlatively absurd, except from affectation—they would sink the Tailor. —MY OWN WORKS. The moment was now at hand. It was dark in my room, but I knew it not; and I was faint and weary. For twenty-four hours, I had not tasted food, nor shut my eyes. At last, there was a faint rap at the door.—“He is come,” said a soft voice; could I be mistaken? O no— I caught up the letter that I had finished; opened the door widely, and the apparition of Caroline stood before me. I was quite stupified for a moment; and when I put the letter into her hand, she tottered;—and I caught her, almost insensible, in my arms.—My trunks were already gone. I would leave nothing to accident. I had made up my mind; and there was no going back; yet, when I felt Caroline again in my arms; her cold cheek pressing my mouth—the death-like stillness and darkness about me—O, I would have strangled her and myself, upon the spot, could I have done it, without hurting or disfiguring her. I wanted to die— I was willing to die—but what should I do. Every moment, I might expect a summons. In my perturbation and terrour, I carried her into my own room, and laid her upon my own bed. I spoke to her. She made no reply. I pressed her to my bosom, and kissed her dear forehead; still no reply. I lifted the curtain of the nearest window. She was utterly lifeless; and, as I looked upon her, I grew desperate. If she be truly dead—dead—I said to myself, “we shall never part.” I had loosened her dress; her beautiful bosom lay half open before me; and the dim twilight, as it fell upon her, gave to her a sad, touching, unearthly paleness. My pistol was in my hand—another moment, and she had been the death of me. Just then! the shadow of her mouth stirred. I kissed her—and, after a few gentle undulations of her bosom—a deep sigh; and two or three faint attempts to lift her delicate hand, letting it fall each time, as if it were lifeless, upon the bed.— She put her arms round my neck, as I leaned over her, and murmured—with her wet mouth against my neck— “O mother—O dear, dear mother!” I released her hands; I trembled for her. I endeavoured to reassure her; and was mortally afraid that some of the family might enter; and, what would be thought? My agitation was frightful; but my presence of mind never forsook me. I locked the door, and came to her, (it was a desperate thought, but the only one.) It was yet some moments, before she knew me—my tears had fallen all over her face. “Mother!—Father!”—said she, wildly, rising from the bed—her dishevelled hair all about her—“where am I?”—who art thou!—thou! O, William, William! is it—is it—?” I could only whisper her name. She arose, feeble and faint, fully aware, I believe, of her situation; yet, pressing as the peril was, still afraid, or unwilling to go. “Wilt thou leave me, William?” she whispered, while her trembling wet eye-lids were moving against mine—“O do not leave me.” She shut her eyes;—I could feel that she did, for the lashes swept over my cheek; and awaited my answer. I could not utter a word; for my everlasting happiness, I could not—for several minutes. But, after a while—. “Caroline, we must part”—said I, “we must—.” I felt her hands, that were locked over my shoulders, relax, and her head falling:—yet, I could not endure, that she should be found in my chamber, at such an hour—O, no, not for all the world; her purity was dearer to me, than to her own father; and I,—I, would not have survived the blasting of her name. “Yes, dear, we must part,” I repeated, “your father is at hand—the stranger is come—leave me, dear, I beseech thee, leave me!” “But” no—“no! I will not! I never will leave thee,” she replied, faintly, and clinging to me all the while. Who would have believed it? so timid, so innocent, yet so resolute and daring. Her bosom, I have already told you, while it was yet light enough to see the hushed heaving of it, had been revealed to me, for a moment; yet—yet, such was the awful tenderness of my heart for her, that I had turned away my eyes from it, and replaced the thin handkerchief that covered it, while she was yet insensible.— But now, now, that I had her in my arms; and could feel the blood rippling through the blue veins, of her white, soft neck, against which my forehead rested,—I knew not how long—God knows, that I had forgotten every thing—every thing on this earth---I shuddered in the contact; I drew her to me convulsively, and pressed my passionate mouth to her bosom, Gracious heaven!—I felt her heart stop; and her head reel. She turned cold instantly, all over. Her flesh was like marble—and yet it was covered with perspiration;— and her breathing was frightful. She attempted to arise, but she had not the strength; what kept her alive, I know not—indignation perhaps; but she put me away from her, and then—O, I thought that I should never get my breath again. My voice rattled in my chest. I was dying; I felt that I was—and that, if she did not speak quickly, I should be a dead man, unforgiven for my last transgression. A long interval past, of unutterable agony. I reached some water to her; and she bathed her temples, trying, repeatedly, to arise, but she could not. I heard a step—it was the father's—and there were other voices. “O Caroline! Caroline!” I cried, “forgive me— speak to me! speak to me—I am desperate—our death is at hand—speak to me—tell me, that I am forgiven.” She arose—she put both of her hands upon my forehead, as if to prevent me from seeing her shame—and tears, and tenderness;—fell upon my bosom, and whispered---O, it was musick to me—it was the voice of humanity, to a shipwrecked and famished creature, upon a desolate rock---“I do forgive thee!” The door Cc 2 opened!—what!—had I not locked it—no, no—I had not. And there were strange faces—servants—lights —the father and mother—and—merciful Providence! could I be deceived—Hammond the dwarf! How came he there! whence! who! what was he! My hair rose—my brain whirled—and—I—I—. I was conscious of nothing more, except that a phantom went by, with her dress torn and bloody—tears continually streaming from her eyes—and her hair all in disorder; and then, it seemed to me, that there was the report of a pistol. And soon after, I awoke, in thick darkness. I remembered it, and shuddered. Was I again in the mad house? Who was this, that sat by me, motionless and voiceless? I put out my hands, and encountered another. It was cold and muscular. “Who are you?” said I, “speak to me.” “Hammond the dwarf;” was the reply. “And by what right,” said I, “do you pursue, and thwart, and worry me?—at every step?—you!” “By the right of a superiour.” “You, you my superior! God! if I had you, monster, upon the solid earth; or in the bowels of it, upon molten iron, I would wrench a contradiction of that, out of your heart. Where am I?” “In my house.” “Yours!—let me begone.” “No; it is impossible.” “No!—who shall detain me?” “I—I will detain you. God will detain you.” “Blasphemer!”—would that the everlasting skies might fall upon you, for your saying!” “Be done, William Adams; be done with this; no resistance. I will be obeyed. You are in my power. I can do as I please, with you. You have attempted my life.” “I—liar!—scoundrel!—monster!—what mean you?” “You have wounded me, in the presence of many witnesses; mortally, it was thought, for nearly a month.” “When was this?” “When you were first discovered—Ah, William Adams, when will you have compassion upon woman; the innocent and lovely Caroline—” I leaped from my bed—I tore myself away from the encompassing bands—I threw myself at his throat— and he was astonished, I am sure, at my quickness and strength; but, Lord! he overcame me, in an instant; and replaced me again, as quietly, upon my bed, as if I had been a babe. “Beware how you pronounce that name again;” said I—exhausted with passion. “If I live, I will strangle you for it” A dead silence followed. Still, the impenetrable monster moved not—spoke not; and the night wore away, if it were night, without a breath or a murmur. I was weary of this tremendous silence. It was insupportable, I felt my arms. They were exceedingly emaciated; and my hair, I fancied, had been recently shaved, close to my head; for, there was a strange smoothness, and softness in it, as if it were new hair, or the hair of an infant. What! was my dream coming true, at last? “O—” said I, unwilling to pronounce a name, so hateful to me—“will you answer me?” “I will;” said he—starting with surprise, at the tone of my voice; “whatever I can—now, that you are rational.” “Where am I?” “In the Pennsylvania hospital.” “What! What!” I yelled—“in the hospital?” “Be calm, William Adams,” he replied, I thought, with some emotion; these frightful starts of passion, are very perilous. I have undertaken your cure.” “My cure! What mean you? How came you here?” “My relation is the manager. Nay, nay, you are in safe hands, if you will only behave like a man. I have come here, to watch by you, and protect you.” “You! you! to watch by me, and protect me! Say, rather, to torture and distract me, by your cruelty and mockery.” “William Adams!” said he, in a voice, that was like the voice of majesty, rising in the wind, to a trumpet call....it fell upon my heart, like a sentence; “I pity you. You wrong me. When have I mocked at you? when have I derided and tortured you?” I felt it. I felt it. It was scalding lead to me.— Why had I hated him? Not that he had wronged, and mocked at, and spit upon me; but, that I had wronged him, through all my life—mocked at him, from my very boyhood; and spit upon him, till I was blind with passion. What could I do? I could not repent, all at once. I could not embrace a mortal foe, so suddenly. Yet, yet, there was a yearning at my vitals; and I was so utterly ashamed and humbled, by the awful justice of his rebuke, that I could, almost, have lain down upon the earth; and prayed to him, to set his foot upon my neck. “Hammond,” said I—it almost choked me, to pronounce his name. “How long have I been here?” “Nearly three months.” “What!—Do I hear aright? Where, then, is Caroline?—the father—the mother—the—. O, the light breaks in, upon me! It was you, Hammond, you, that destroyed me. But for you—and yet, you have dared to ask what you have done to me—yea, in mockery, and wrong, and insult—ha! ha! ha!— go on---go on---thou prince of darkness—thou—.” He leaned over me—there was a light, cold and starry; and, I could see his forehead work; and the tears fell upon me—(not like the church yard dew;) and his voice came, with a compassionate sound, as from a labouring heart. I could not brush off the tears, then— no—though once, a drop, from the eyes of Hammond, had been to me, like distillation, from the limbs of a gibbetted man—a murderer, hung up to the weeping of midnight dews; and the wailing of November winds. “Three months!” I cried; “and where are they?” “Ask me no questions, now”—said Hammond—“we must not suffer you to be agitated. Believe that all are well—all—your sister—and friends;—and try to sleep. I shall leave you, now, for a little time—but, there will be a servant, within call. Try to sleep, if you can.” He left me; but, I could not sleep. “Three months!” I said, continually, to myself. “Here, so long, so alone, for three whole months.” But, as I thought, with my eyes partly shut, there were some glimpses of recollection; intervals of sanity—I thought, in this dreary and endless alienation. I heard a step; it was the step of an aged woman. I called her to me; and soon learnt, to my mortification, that I had been watched, by the abused Hammond, in darkness, day after day, night after night, when people were dying, all about me, of a pestilential disorder; that his own life had nearly fallen a sacrifice to his watchfulness over me; that he was the admiration of all the household; that, I had passed for his brother; notwithstanding that, in my lucid intervals, I had called upon his name, and cursed him, with the most fearful imprecations; for all that was natural, to the bereaved of understanding, who are always most inveterate, to their nearest and dearest friends. But, there was yet something else to be told. Hezekiah Anson had failed—was utterly ruined; and nobody could tell me whither he had gone. The next day, I saw Hammond, and pressed his hand. The room was a little lighter, then. He was very much disturbed. “William,” said he, “in one word—one word is enough—tell me what were your designs upon Caroline —innocent, or guilty?” “Open that window,” said I, firmly—“let me see the face of the man, who dares to ask that question.” It was opened. I started at the countenance before me. It was cadaverous, worn; but lofty and impregnable; like one that had never smiled. It was Hammond; but something, I know not what, had grown upon his broad forehead, and great eyes, that carried authority with it. His mouth was beautiful; and teeth, the finest in the world; even in his boy-hood. But, his nostrils were wide, and blood-coloured; like those of a race horse—lenoting extraordinary vigour; and his head was altogether too large for his body. His right arm was in a sling; and, he halted, worse than ever, in his walk. I measured him, steadily, with my eyes; looked into his very heart; bore his gaze, so intrepidly, that his eyes filled with the effort. “What prompted him, to that question,” I asked myself---“not curiosity---no---he is above that. Doubt--- perhaps---let me see.” “Will you believe my bare word, Hammond? whatever it be.” “I will,” said he, promptly. His countenance never altered. “I am innocent.” He was gone. I heard no more from him, for three days. At the end of that time, he brought a young man to me, pale as death, whom I instantly recognised to to be the person, of whom, nearly a year before, I had been rather jealous. Hammond led him to my bed side; and immediately left the room. “You know the object of my visit, I suppose,” said he, to me. “No—I do not.” (He was a good deal embarrassed.) “It is to apologize to you. I have injured you.” “You?—I know not how.” “Car—Car—no, I cannot pronounce her name— I have wronged you, and am sorry for it,” said he. “I forgive you, young man,” I replied, with all my heart. “But how was it?” “By searching into your history; believing everything that I heard against you; and nothing that I heard in your favour—and repeating it to the father of Caroline.” I said nothing; but my eyes told him, what I thought of him; and I soon found that my hands were cramped with my effort to suppress my passion;—and that I had grappled the sheets, as I would, the throat of a wild beast; and was holding them yet, till my bones ached. “After the appearance of the Dwarf, I met him; and he spoke of you, as one, full of great qualities, that had done much evil, unwittingly. I told Hezekiah; and he went to the Dwarf. I know not what followed, until you shot him.” “I—shot whom—whom do you mean.” “The Dwarf.” “Explain yourself. There is a misunderstanding here.” “I allude to the chamber—when—O, Mr. Adams, it is to you, that I owe these tears—but for you---” It was some minutes before he could speak; and I began to find a little glimmering upon the past; some coherency between my recollection of the chamber, and pistol—“If I understand you rightly,” said I—“you allude to—no matter what—is the story abroad?” “It is—all over the world—the wide world!” “Did I shoot Hammond?” “So the story goes. He was wounded in the breast —you perceive that his arm is in a sling now—you shattered the arm. You were carried away for dead. The whole town took up the affair; and you were sent to the hospital, where Hammond has attended you, night and day. Your disorder has been a complication, they say. You have had the yellow fever, during your delirium; and, though you have had several lucid intervals; yet, they say, that you forget all that has happened, at the next relapse—and awake each time, as from a long sleep.” “But what brought you to me?” “Hammond.” “Hammond!—how so?” “He made me come.” “Made you!—what mean you?” “Why—I mean this—that he has gone through the whole town, fighting your battles, and confronting your enemies, till many, that were your deadly calumniators, have became your friends.” What could I say?—I would have knelt—but I was too weak—I could not. I shut my eyes, and felt the tears trickling under my lashes, down to my very lips—they were bitter and hot, and, I hope, penitential.” “But how are they all?” said I, again, as soon as I could speak. “Whom do you mean?” “Hezekiah—and Eunice—and—.” “Ruined—ruined, past redemption!—in the last degree of wretchedness and dependence—utterly helpless and desolate in their old age—and—ah, so utterly, that—” “And Caroline,” said I—“tell me—how is she? —well, is she not?—O, tell me---for the love of God, tell me—.” “What!”—he answered---looking at me with compassion, and great alarm, as if he thought me relapsing. “O speak to me!”---I repeated---“tell me, where is she?” “And have you heard nothing—nothing,” said he--- in a whisper, as if—I know not what; but,---for a moment, I felt as if my own heart had been buried alive —the words, even of his whispering, fell one, one by one, upon it, like wet clods. “Nothing,” I answered. He took my hand. “Man,” he said, “man!---innocent or guilty, I pity you! I cannot tell you what has happened to—her---but she is living, yet---yet--- yet—” I gasped for breath. “She has been nearer to you than, it seems, you have dreamed of, in your delirium.” “Gracious God!---that was it!---that was it!---I know now!---I remember it all---all! O, I heard her sweet voice, night after night, calling upon me---and I thought it all a dream---I remember it now, now. Dear, dear Caroline---and could'st thou watch over me, thou pitying one!---Caroline! Caroline!” I cried. “Hush!”—he said---“She watch over you!—O, no ---she is gone---she cannot hear you---she was a mad woman” “What!—” “For nearly two months, Caroline Anson was in the very next apartment to yours, delirious---with her broken hearted parents weeping over her---dishonoured in their beautiful daughter; ashamed in their old age. O, sir, how could you spoil so fair, so innocent a creature?” I tried---but I could not speak---I felt my veins bursting---my throat parched—I— “Spoil her!” I shrieked out---“but---speak to me--- one word---but one, before I throw myself upon you--- is she alive?” “Yes---barely.” “In her senses?” “Yes—.” “Leave me, then—leave me!” I cried “leave me, while you may—I forgive you. But, for the comfort of your own heart, believe me—nay, I intreat you to believe me---we are innocent---our embracing was innocent, as that of angels.” “What sir---innocent! locked up in your room, at night; pistols upon the bed; her dress torn, and her hair disordered; locked in your very arms---weeping; and inarticulate! O, man! man! you may not be the most guilty---the most damnable of villains; but you are the murderer of Caroline.” Where was I? The sound was there yet. The murderer of Caroline! “Come back! come back!” I shouted—but no, no, no!—I was left alone, to destroy myself, with my own supplication. Hammond came, soon after; he was thunderstruck, at my appearance. I was dressed, from head to foot—I know not how, nor by whom, nor when. The clothes did not appear like my own. “What is the meaning of this?” said he, “Who has done this?” I could not speak. I tried, but I could not. I arose —took his hand; and moved toward the door. “William Adams. William,” said he, kindly, “what ails you? Do speak to me. I tremble for you. Ha!— you have heard—I am sure of it—the scoundrel!—I shall be tempted to wrench him, joint from joint, the next time that we meet” I laid my hand upon his arm---it was the wounded arm. He shrunk---and then—O! that pang---it was the shattered arm—and I had shattered it— “Somebody has been talking to you, of Caroline.” Is it not so?” he continued, contracting his brows, with pain. Dd I nodded---and the tears scalded my eyes, again. “And you would see her?” “Yes, yes---” I answered, convulsively---dead or alive, I will see her. Come---come.” “It is impossible!” he replied. I looked upon him, for a moment, like a wild beast, I am sure. Not a muscle trembled. All my suspicions returned. He saw them return. “Down with your black blood, William Adams;” he said. “Trust to me. You cannot see Caroline, to-night.” “Cannot!---Who shall hinder me? I will.” “You shall not!” said he, resolutely, placing himself before me. I would have stabbed him to the heart---crushed him to death, if I could; but, when I threw myself upon him, with my heart strings tightened to snapping; and my blood-vessels all distended to bursting---he baffled me, as you would, an infant; and, when I had come to my senses, I stood before him, weeping, like a spoilt child, with shame, and indignation. Where was my strength? It had been terrible, once. Where was it, now? I looked down upon my hands---my legs---trod the floor. Alas, my strength had departed from me! I was weaker than the shorn Sampson. I fell upon my knees before him. “O, Hammond--- Hammond!” said I, if there be one feeling of humanity about thee---one place that---but, no, no, no---thou art a monster. Love never came near thee. Thou canst not love. What! have I touched thee? O, have pity on me. Suffer me to see her, once more. O, lead me to her, let me but see her, once more! once more! She is sick, Hammond; I know that she is. And could you, gracious God! would you take upon your soul, the risk of separating us, at such a moment! If she die—she will haunt you---and, I---O, I know not what I should do---but that---I never shall forgive you---O, let me see her---let me see her, dear Hammond---for the love of Jesus!” Tears filled his eyes. He lifted me up. “William,” said he; “you cannot see Caroline, to night. It is a critical time, in her disorder. Whatever be the result, she will, undoubtedly, live several days. Nay, nay---bear it like a man. My friend---sir—William, William Adams.---Where is your fortitude---where---your sister--- bear up against it.” I was no longer sensible---but gave myself up, passively, like an idiot, to his direction. That night, and part of the next day, I had terrible dreams; but, toward the evening of the third day, I observed, that many strange people were about me; that I was dressed, when half asleep; and shaved, with great care and tenderness. At last, there was a large mirror set before me, I remember; and I stood, and trembled at my own figure. It was frightful, haggard, and attenuated, beyond all my conception, and experience. I now recollect, that there was a strange dizziness and darkness, all about me; and, a great heaviness at my heart; and, then, a long and dreary interval, in which I saw nothing but lights, continually passing and re-passing me; and great, still shadows, mute as death; and that I heard nothing but the noise of carriage wheels, going forever, in one direction; and then, there was a strong, cold wind, as from the sea beach, and the splash of water—the noise of rowing, and the heeling of a boat—but, all was profoundly dark; and I, I neither saw, nor heard, nor understood it. It was like a dream to me, from beginning to end; but, far less vivid and frightful, than many dreams that I have had; and, I bore it all, patiently; but, with a mortal oppression at my heart; a boding, as of a yet more tremendous evil. Then, was I suddenly stopped, in my meditation, by a jar that shook me, from head to foot. I was led out, and bidden to step carefully; and I felt, what I took to be sea-weed, wet and slippery, crushing under my feet; and the rocks, upon which I trod, were smooth, and wave-worn; and there were many voices, whispering about me; and strange shapes; muffled up; and, a great, even, level sheet, of what I took to be a motionless water, away behind me. And then, we had a long, long journey, on foot; and Hammond's voice, with a tone of authority, I heard, several times, afar off, giving orders; and, at last, I was sitting in a miserable hovel; broken chairs, tables, and other furniture were all about; as if vessels had been shipwrecked there; and, there was nothing, that I had ever seen before, in such a place; but, altogether, a kind of shattered combination, as if a noble dwelling had been wrecked, somewhere, afar off, and the furniture washed upon the beach. It was very cold; and, there was no fire upon the hearth—not a spark. I sat, and ruminated within me, with my eyes shut, while the bleak wind stirred my hair; and left it, saturated with moisture, as if the spray of salt water had been, born inland. I was still in a kind of melancholy stupor; and would start up, now and then, affrighted, as if I were falling overboard—in my sleep; and uncover my face; and look about, for a moment, hardly able to persuade myself, that I was not yet in the boat; so strongly did the waves still continue to dash, and roar about me; and so long did I feel the motion of the boat. At times, too, there were voices of wailing and lamentation; and some sweet, very sweet toned instrument, it appeared to me, now and then spoke out, delicately, for a moment, as if the night-wind touched it, in passing. At last, there were other voices; and a fire was kindled; and, when I looked into the faces about me, they looked upon me, with such a piteous expression—that I was afraid. My poor eyes ached, sadly; and the room was full of a thick smoke, dashed, here and there, with a thin, fitful, blueish blazing, very brilliant; but, very trying to the eyes; and the countenances there, appeared hovering and floating about me; and the statue of Hammond, unearthly. The wind blew, down the chimney, and scattered the fire. “Gracious God!” cried one of the men—“it will be a terrible night!” “Aye, aye, Jim, you may well say that—for—mercy on us!—Lord God! how it thunders!” The wind rose, then; and the crazy hovel shook for a minute, as if it were adrift upon the water; groaning and creaking, as if it were out in a hurricane; but, I felt no sort of fear; none in the world; the smoke, and the wind, and the dust, and the voices, were all like a dream, to me; and even the roaring of the sea—the thunder—the salt spray—and the shouting of men, afar off, that I continually heard, although my head was muffled up, and I was like one asleep, more than awake—were all more like some vision, that I was endeavouring, with painful interest to remember again, than anything of reality, in which I was concerned. “Ah! the light!—the light!”—cried another. “Fire! Fire!”—cried another, out in the open air. A sudden blaze of light, that penetrated even to my covered and shut eyes; and a tremendous crash of thunder, that shook the very earth under us, followed, immediately, like a discharge of heavy ordnance, and made us all start upon our feet, and all but me, run out of the house. “In the name of God, what is the matter?” cried I; but, before I could get an answer, I had fallen back in my seat, where I could see through the fissures of the logs, out of which, the clay had been shaken, another hovel, on higher ground, afar off, all in a light blaze. The rain poured, frightfully; and, the house tottered, and trembled, and swung about, as if it would fall about our ears, every moment; while the whole room was dark, with the dust of the blue clay, and plastering, that were shaken out of the walls and chimney. The lightning had struck a part of the building, it appeared; and set fire to the only other house, upon the place. After this; nay, even in the midst of it, I fell into a little uneasy slumber—from which I was waked, by the low voices of people near me, whispering. “It is impossible. They cannot live through it,” said one. “Ah, Jonathan, Jonathan—think of their coming here, to take up with a fisherman's life, in their old age—so good to the poor, as he was—so kind and free—ah, poor K'iah—hard life this.” “In their old age too,” replied another---“Ah, that's it.” Somebody was plainly sobbing near me. I looked at the shadow. It was the dwarf. His chest heaved, as with a convulsion. Still there was a strangeness about all these things, that reminded me only of past dreams; and the Dd 2 knowledge, that I had been out of my senses lately, kept me incredulous to their proof, even then. “When will this end?” I muttered inwardly,---“it is very childish---and wintry---in my bed, I suppose---perhaps in my cell---and—.” My breathing startled Hammond, who came to me; and in that voice of unutterable power, which no man living could hear unmoved, bid me prepare myself. “I will,” said I, “I am prepared,” scarcely heeding what he said. The noise of the wind and the sea had abated; and the shaking of the house, I observed, was all over. Just then, the tread of another was heard approaching; but I was weary of my own thought; and I drew my heavy cloak about me; and buried my face in it again, and fell sleep; yet while I slept, I dreamed, or heard a dialogue of this nature, carried on very near me, by unknown voices. “Is that he?” “Yes---do not speak loud.” “Poor fellow---will he bear it?” “I know not; he is no common man---but, will she?” I heard no answer; but the breathing of Hammond was then suspended, for a moment, as if he were listening; and then he laid his hand upon mine. “She” thought I, to myself, “whom do they mean? what she?. What have I came here for—here—I am not, here—where am I?—surely there were some—.” But my thoughts were diverted away again. “But how happened this ruin?—why do not their friends assist them? Their creditors—.” “Their creditors!” said Hammond, with a little laugh, “creditors—what! will ye ask the Egyptian to free his hewer of wood, and drawer of water—the master to set the slave free. Both may do so, if the slave and bondmen be old and worthless; but the creditor, never!—never!” “But the Society.—They are humane.” “The society. They!—it is they, that have broken his heart They thrust him out from among them; forth upon the world, more than a year ago, because— O, the righteous administration of such men—because some foreign house, in which poor Anson was concerned—.” “Anson—Anson!” thought I; “not Hezekiah Anson— O, no, not Hezekiah”---But he went on. —“Had failed. They called it commercial gambling; and, after a while, they thrust the old man out from among them. There began the history of his calamities. He was no longer one of them;---and it was too late to renew his covenant, with any other religion. Abused and broken down; shut out from them, that he had dwelt, and worshipped with, for half a century—he began to neglect his affairs---to entrust them to others;---they have gone now to rack, and ruin; but, he is still free, still untrammelled with debt. To the last shirt upon his back; the last earthly remnant, he hath sold, and paid!---and this,---look about you, and behold the result;---this hovel, which he built, in the day of his prosperity; and gave away to the family of a poor fisherman, who left it years ago, to the birds and the beasts of the island---is now his only refuge. He is too old to work---he cannot beg---he will not borrow, when there is no hope of repaying---cannot steal;---and hath come here, alone, with his wife and child, to die.” “His wife and child---his child,” said I, “of whom is he talking?” Still, I was troubled; and a cloud was upon me. “But, were it known, he would be relieved, I am sure; hundreds of people in the city love and respect him.” “You are mistaken. They did love and respect him; but they do so no longer. He is poor---wretchedly poor, now; with no money to lend; no merchandize to sell; no ships to freight; and the tenderest hearted think it quite enough to be charitable, when they are persuaded, and solicited, while calamity is yet fresh and frightful in its visitation. But, now---now, that many winters have passed; and poor Anson is too much of a man to run after the world, and importune them, and supplicate them with his gray hair, and trembling hands; and the desolation is already an old story---it were vain.” The speaker was interrupted by a loud shriek from a room above. “Gracious God!—the lightning flashed in, all at once upon me—the house tottered; as I leaped upward; and rent and tore my way, like a mad man, out of the encumbering habiliments. It was her voice —hers!—I knew it—I followed it—I broke through the partition—I threw myself upon a bed—. “Yes, it was she—it was she!—poor, dear Caroline.” She knew me, immediately; shrieked twenty times, without stopping; and put her delicate arms around my neck, and sobbed aloud; and laughed and cried on my bosom. I slept then—very suddenly—for, I knew not how long; and we both slept, breast to breast; and, when I awoke, I found myself in a better apartment, sitting up—a curtained bed before me; and an aged man sitting near it; the blue chintz curtain drawn; and a woman, whom I knew, kneeling by the side of it. I waited, and waited, until I heard a slight motion in the bed, and saw a thin white hand put out; and the curtains drawn; and the candle that was by the bed-side, upon the light stand, flared widely for a moment. Yes, yes! it was Caroline! I staggered to the bed. I fell upon my knees—I articulated her name; and I felt her caressing hand in my hair, pressing my forehead. I drew it to my lips. Not a word was uttered. Nothing was heard but a deep, deep heaving of the heart, at long intervals, as if all of us were dreaming together, under a heavy load. “Hezekiah,” said I, “is it Hezekiah? He lifted his eyes—they were fiery. I touched the woman. She shook off my hand, as if it were the touch of blood.—O, would that I might awake! I cried, “where am I?” “William, William, love!” said a voice, of such endearing softness. O, it was that which I had heard in the next room, and thought to be some instrument, tuned by the wind. I became more composed. I looked upon Caroline. Never, no never, had I seen her so very beautiful—her complexion so delicately, vividly transparent; her wonderful, large, clear eyes so deep and dark, and lustrous—there was a drop of star light in their very centre. “Caroline,” said I, it is you, I am sure. Do you know me?” “Know thee, William!”---Her sweet lips parted, as they spoke, and trembled, with the intenseness of her rebuke---“O, when have I forgotten thee! father! look up! mother---awake! The hour is at hand; the hour of trial. My weakness hath gone. Awake, and listen to me! William do thou place a pillow for me---assist me to rise---and let me lay my head upon thy shoulder.” The old man arose; and took his wife's hand, and stood before the child's bed, in obedience, like creatures that are about consummating a religious ceremony. There was a silence so fearful, for some minutes--that, but for the breathing of Caroline,---I should have relapsed into my first doubting, and fancied that the venerable creatures, who stood before me, were shadows of another world. “Father”---said Caroline---“Mother! I have brought sorrow to your aged hearts. You have loved me, and doated on me. I had been obedient, I thought, all my life. Every thought of my heart had been told to you. I had no concealment---none. Yet---I am upon my death bed;—now, in the blossom of my youth;-- the gray hairs of my father, and my mother, are going down to the grave with me;---and the man that I loved very tenderly---he is about to follow me.---I am dying, mother---and sincerity like mine, cannot be sinful at such a moment---do not reproach me, therefore, that I tell my love, now, for the first time. But O, William ---William---let the lesson be written upon thy heart! My first errour---was concealment---my next, the sin of disobedience—and that went on, and on, till---- it is now too late to deny it---though I die chastely, yet ---I do not deserve it. I have been too utterly in thy power. And now---we have not many minutes more.--- Let me see you forgive each other.” I put out my arms to embrace her mother. She shrank, and trembled. Her love for me was all gone. “O, mother!” said Caroline; “this, to thy daughter, on her death bed! This, thy lesson of forgiveness and resignation? Wilt thou not believe?---William Adams ---my beloved---stand thou up, there! Remember that thou art in the presence of a just God! Bear thou witness for me! Speak thou, to this aged man and woman ---they that forget their humanity, and their relationship to a dying child; and declare thou my innocence!” “By my hope of everlasting salvation,” cried I, kneeling and clasping my hands, “Caroline is altogether innocent!” We embraced then---and sobbed---and wept. “And by mine too! mother, mine too! and the season of trial is too near to me now, for deception. He too is innocent. As I hope for mercy---I am innocent, and he too;---but I declare to you, that I owe it less to myself, that I am so, than to his mercy; and to the protection of our Father in Heaven. And now, William, farewell. I must be alone. I cannot have thee near me, at my last hour---dear---it will take off my thought from heaven. Would'st thou, that I should die reluctantly?— Then, leave me---leave me---my father and mother will remain—heaven have mercy on me---O---I—I—” Again the old man embraced me---and the mother. “O, William,” said she, as her grey hairs were woven with mine, “thou should'st have been the husband of Caroline---our dear child---but---it is, now, too late. Be patient William. Farewell!” I turned toward Caroline---I went to the bed again. I knew not what supported me---I went to her---she had turned away her face---and her beautiful hand had fallen over the pillow. I touched it—it was strangely cold—I put my mouth to hers, once more—God!—it was all over with her—and darkness fell upon me—and fire—a storm of brightness—and— END OF VOL. I.</field>
