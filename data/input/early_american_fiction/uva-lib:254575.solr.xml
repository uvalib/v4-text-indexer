      <field name="fulltext">THE YOUNG ARTIST CHAPTER I. “There be stories tolden in pictures as well as in bokes and a cunning paynter doth discourse with his pencil even as a ready wryter doth with his pen; and some do think he hath the greater honor and the dignity; inasmuch as genius is more excelling in artes than in lettres.” The old stage road from Philadelphia to Lancaster, within a league or more of the latter place, descends abruptly into a narrow glen, through which, over a rocky bed, tumbles a wild and noisy brook. Gigantic trees line its rugged banks, and form above a leafy canopy, through which the noon-day sun scarce penetrates, flecking the dark sward beneath with splashes of golden light, and gilding here and there a sparkling wave as it leaps upward in its gambols. Across the stream is thrown a rustic bridge, so old that from the huge gaps in in its crazy joints, there grow, nourished by the dark, rich loam, with which time has filled them, long waving grass, shrubs, and even flourishing young trees; so that the passing traveller is scarcely less over-shadowed in crossing the bridge than in the forests through which the road has hitherto wound. One of the rude beams of the structure, with an eye both to economy and strength, characteristic of those days when it was built, is morticed in the trunk of an aged sycamore, which flings broadly above it, its long, white spectral arms, as if its protecting genii. At the foot of the tree, a narrow, rustic wheel-road turns off to the right, and following the bank disappears in the intricacies of the overhanging trees. Upon the bark of the sycamore, but so near the ground that a horseman would have to lean from his saddle to read it, is nailed a guide-board, fashioned like a man's hand, with the fore finger extended. From its worm-eaten corners, its weather-beaten face, and faintly visible characters, it doubtless was placed there by the founders of the bridge itself. With some difficulty, the words, “To Eden” can be made out by the curious traveller who may chance in a summer's day to stop and refresh his horse and himself in the cool glade, ere he attempts the perilous passage of the little bridge before him. `To Eden.” This is all the passing traveller knows. Not a figure to mark the distance, nor the least trace of there ever having been any placed there, is visible to the nicest eye. “To Eden!” reads the stranger. and passes on his way; and the little finger-board which for a moment drew his attention and awakened a temporary curiosity is soon forgotten! But it shall not be so with ourselves, dear reader! We are a traveller, not of the highways but of the byways; the seeker out of snug rural nooks; a lover of shade rather than of sunshine; delighting more in the fragrance of flowers, and the green sward that clothes the hills and all the vallies round, than in the rocky turnpike and dusty thoroughfares; beholding more beauty in a majestic tree than in a stately tower; more harmony in the hum of a bee than in the buzz of the crowd; more beauty in a running rivulet than in the finest jet d'eau; more enjoyment in a ramble through a woodland path than a dashing drive through Chestnut street; and, altogether believing that true happiness is to be sought rather in the quiet corners of the world than amid the splendid pageantries of life, invested as they may be with all the blandishments of art. We will not now, therefore, cross the old bridge and travel along the turnpike; but leaving the highway, turn short into the path at the foot of the tree, and follow its windings beside the brook, which, after twice leaping into a cascade of tumbling snow, and thrice spreading out into a miniature mere, without a ripple upon the mirror like surface of its breast, dashes riotously through a narrow channel, and is lost amid the gloom of the deep set forests. But after a brief absence, if we continue our way, we shall see it issuing in a vale and expanding into a little lake of the most picturesque character, with a quiet hamlet of a few white cottages, clustered about a snowy spire, on one side, and a gentle slope of pasture land, sprinkled with herds on the other; while around rise hills with green luxuriant swells, either crested with noble forests, or sweeping down to the shore, in lawns of the brightest verdure. This hamlet is “Eden!” the valley, which you perceive is not a mile in length, and in width scarce half as much, is called Eden Valley; and the lake, lively with ducks and geese, and children's adventurous barks, sent off with many a shout, from the village shore, is called “Eden Mere.” Is it not all beautiful! so still, so quiet, so rural, so shut out from the world around it! How much we should have lost, had we crossed the old bridge and rode on to Lancaster, and yet have wandered only a mile and a half from the high road; for, the venerable guide-board is silent, this only is the distance of the lowly hamlet from the old sycamore. Indeed it is so near that the village children used always of a Saturday afternoon to follow the stream up to the bridge to fish; for there is beneath it, nigh one corner, a fine deep trout-hole, in which their dirty naked feet, hanging over the timber ends, the holiday rogues would ply their hooks till they could no longer see their shadows in the black waters below them; then with their loaded baskets, they would-start on a nimble race homeward, and as twillight gathered the faster they ran; for there were familiar tales of woodland goblins, remembered then, that quickened their pace, lest night should overtake them ere they reached the school house; which being the first building on the village skirts, in the direction of the bridge, was to them, safe ground. This school-house was an ancient scructure, having existed through three generations of village urchins, the grand child sitting at the same hacked and inky bench where his grandfather had been first inducted into the mysteries of Dilworth. It stood at the extremity of the village street, on an open green space, where several forest oaks, suffered to remain, cast a shade upon its roof and the surrounding lawn, which, in summer, was their play ground; the Mere, which was a stone's throw in front, being in winter, with its glassy bosom inviting the skater to his favorite pastime, substituted for it. The school house was a square wooden building, with a high Dutch roof, its low eaves stretching on every side, far beyond the outer walls. It had four windows placed very high from the ground, one on each side of the house; and a single door facing the water. An irregular flat stone, well worn by little feet, was laid before it, and the grass, for many yards around it, was trodden by the feet of three generations of urchins, till it had become nearly as hard and smooth as the door stone itself. Every thing about the school-house was characteristic. The narrow clapboards were covered with initials; and names only traditionally known in the village, were cnt deep into the wood, with jack knives, some bearing date as far back as 1753; while here and there were curious hieroglyphics, that no man might tell the meaning of, but doubtless meant for good honest words and letters: there were to be seen, also, profiles of more or less merit; men, all legs and head; scrawls with lead pencils or red chalk on the smoother and whiter surfaces; names of favorite school girls, now grandmothers; caricatures of the several masters, and the usual display of obscene words, that show the corrupt state of the human heart even in its earliest existence—one and all charcteristics of a village school house. Dominie Spankie, at the period of our stay, presided over the destinies of the three-score-and-ten urchins that constituted the juvenile population of the village of Eden; and this school house was the realm in which he had reigned for forty years; and scarce was there to be found a male inhabitant, under fifty years of age in the village, whom, in his time, the Dominie had not had between his knees, inflicting upon him the healthful dicipline of castigation. The Dominie had once been a soldier in the wars, having followed Braddock into the wilderness, and got much damage, as he asseverated, by “the dread onslaught of the wild savages,” losing two fingers on his right hand by the blow of a tomahawk, and one of his eyes by an arrow: and it was pleasant of a Saturday evening to him, on the stoop of the quiet inn of Eden, to relate his warlike exploits, using his ferule, which he never let out of his hand, save when sleeping, now as a musket, now as a broadsword, to aid in illustrating to his wondering listeners, the deeds he had seen and of which he had been a part. The Dominie was tall of stature, erect and military in his port; with a long and sinewy frame, marvellously spare of flesh. His hair was thick and and grey, for he was waxing towards his sixtieth year, and being brushed desperately back from his forehead, bristled over his head after a exceedingly terrific manner. His long habit of command over a regiment of unruly breechlings, had settled a frown upon his shaggy brows; and, as nature had given him a sort of under-eye-brow, his aspect, combined with his sightless orb, when the other was turned upon an offender, was awful to behold. The Dominie, indeed governed by his eye alone; a look being found sufficient to paralyze the stoutest urchin that had the misfortune to incur his wrath. His long service as master, and elevatud him in some sense, to the dignity of pater familias to the whole village; all the souls in which had been in their youth, under his especial eye; and from long habit he still felt disposed to look after the manners and affairs of his quondam pupils, and they themselves, from the same force of habit, to yield him reverence and obedience. So, what with the boys at school, and their fathers at home, the Dominie got to be, save the minister, the most important personage in Eden. By the good wives he was looked upon with a respect amounting to awe; and as he would frown upon them as well as upon their lords and their lords pledges, when things went not to his liking, his looks made such an impression upon many of the more nervous portion of the woman kind, that, (being a bachelor, the Dominie did little consider the times and seasons for administering refroof,) nearly every other male child, to the wonder and astonishment of the whole hamlet, came into the world marked with one eye, and a double pair of eye-brows, looking for all the world as like the Dominie's as one pea looks like another. But this belongs rather to the “Chronicles of the Hamlet of Eden,” and to the Life and Acts of Dominie Spankie, (which have carefully been written and peradventure, one day will see the light,) than to our story, to which what has yet been said is only prefatory. CHAPTER II. One sultry Saturday forenoon, in August, about half an hour before closing the school, Dominie Spankie sat upon his throne which was an arm chair placed upon a platform, raised two steps above the floor. Before him, rising one behind the other, were the ranges of benches filled with the boys, the biggest in the back seats, and the littlest, down to three years old and under, on the front forms, immediately beneath his terrible eye, and only seaprated from him by the area between his desk and their seats. The huge fireplace upon the right of his throne, was garnished with a young pine tree and other ever-greens, and on the broken hearth before it, as the coolest spot was placed a stone pitcher of water, with a tin cup floating upon its surface. It was a very warm day; and scarcely did the light air that came in at the windows lift the leaves of the numerous open books, for every book was laid open before its owner, and the whole school, under the viligant observance of the Dominie, appeared to be studious. Many of the younger boys, in truth, were hard at work, from fear of the birch, which was laid upon the desk before their eyes, in terrorem; and buzz, buzz, buzz went their little lips for very life. Others held their books perpendicularly before their faces, and with one eye fixed desperately upon the page, kept the other askance upon the master, for the Dominie had a way doubtless learned in his wars against the savages, of flinging his oaken ferule through the air, like a tomahawk, so that would unerringly light, (so true was his arm from long practice,) on the desk in front of any idler, without exactly hitting him on the head, but giving him a good start at the time, with a sure promise of flagellation: for the flight of the ruler was sure to be followed in a voice stern, and loud, by `Bring me that ferule, young master!' when the instrument was duly put to its more legitimate use. The boys had just come in from recess, when the Dominie cast his eye sternly over the schoolroom, to see if he could single out any unlucky juvenile inattentive to his task, his ferule balanced across the palm of his left hand, with the two fingers and thumb of the right, gently dallying with its extremity. Instantly every soul went to work, and lips moved mechanically in the sound of study, though, so far as what was repeated from the page before most of them, was underderstood, they might have been reading Chinese as well as the king's English. The Dominie wore spectacles, (a pair of massive iron ones,) that oddly reminded you of the crusading knights, or Don Quixote in armour, which combined with the obliquity of his vision, put the shrewdest boy at fault in guessing, when he happened to lift his face from the desk and look over the school, on which point exactly his gaze rested; each one, therefore, supposed himself as likely to be the victim as any of his fellows. So when the Dominie, from time to time, looked up, and gravely surveyed the array of boys, he always gazed upon a praiseworthy scene; when apparently satisfied at the diligent aspect of his schoolroom, he would ejaculate a gratified hem, and turn again to his task of ruling copy-books, or setting copies for the ensuing week. Although so strict a disciplinarian, the Dominie, like most men, especially schoolmasters, had fallen into certain habits and methods, all of which were well understood by his more saga-cious pupils, who governed themselves accordingly. One of these habits was, while ruling copy-books, always to lift his eye when he got the end of the page, and in setting a copy, when he had given the finishing hair stroke to the line. So, calculating on these periodical inspections of the school-room, the elder and more observing boys, would cleverly manage to time their idle moments to tally with his busy ones: and by this politic arrangement much room was given for play and mischief making. The Dominie wrote very slowly, and with great method; for he prided himself greatly on the beauty of his penmanship, deeming the art of calligraphy as important to the schoolmaster as the knowledge of figures and other mysteries, invented to puzzle boy's brains. On the afternoon in question, after having ruled a page for `fine hand,' he looked up, as was his custom, and chanced to decry an abortive attempt to suppress a laugh, on the faces of all the boys in the back forms, and the best part of those on the second row of desks. He paused, and his brow darkened; but wilily pretending not to observe this unseemingly merriment, well assured that the cause would soon show itself, he husbanded his wrath, and resolved patiently to wait until the treason was ripe. Therefore, he turned himself once more to his copy; and as in the alphabetical arrangement it should begin with D, he commenced penning his own euphonious name and designation, and both having great favor in his eye, he speedily lost the sense of the outrage that had been offered to his authority and magisterial presence, in the pride of exercising his penmanship on the flowing letters that compose Dominie Spankie, A. M. Scarcely had he termined the serpentine flourish that indicated the initial of `Spankie,' than a stifled burst of choking laughter, from some unlucky urchin, caused him to erect his ears and bend his brows; nevertheless he continued to write on; but scarce had he finished the final e, turning the tail therefore gracefully back, over the k, like a canopy, than a suppressed titter from the a, b, c bench at his feet, caused him to start up, with a growl of astonishment and wrathful indignation. He glared about the schoolroom and beheld one universal grin on every visage, while the little tremblers at his feet kept up a tittering and giggling they in vain tried to suppress by stuffing their sponges and handkerchiefs into their mouths, two or three in the attempt, even forcing tears from their eyes; while fear of the Dominie's wrath, mingling with the cause of their mirth, caused other little wretches both to laugh and to cry at one and the same moment. Sounds so strange as laughter in the school-room, a place where a smiling, happy, and cheerful face, seems to be regarded by most `masters' as treasonable to their tyrannical rule, had never been heard before within those old walls. The Dominie was thunderstruck. He could scarcely believe that he heard what he did hear, saw what he did see! Boys daring to langh in his presence! Grinning visages surrounded him on all sides! He shoved back his spectacles from his forehead, as was his wont at such times; lowered his thunder-cloud looking brows; balanced his ferule, preparatory to a cast, and began to squint horribly around in search of the ringleader. At this movement and disposition of his person, there bust one universal uncontrollable shout of laughter, from every juvenile throat, so long and so loud was it, that it was heard even in the midst of the village, to the infinite wonder and alarm of the adult pupils of Dominie Spankie, who could not divine the meaning of so strange a sound coming from such a source. `It's te boys let out o' school,' says one of a group of villagers gathered about the inn. `Nay,' said another, shaking his head, `'tis na twal o' the clock, an' the Doominie e'er stickes to the minnit o't. The lads be unco fay.' `Mercy me! what has come up o'er at the school house, ayond? D' ye not hear the childer, Maggy?' asked one gossip, seated knitting in the door of her neighbor across the way. `Gracious, and 'deed do I! and it's a merry laugh the dears give. Where can the Dominie be away, and it's not noon,' answered the other, giving a knowing look at the sun as she ended. `Mony's the dee I've heard the skreel when the brecken were doon from that awa, but it's the first time I heard laughter,' said an old Scotch woman, stopping her wheel, and taking a pinch of snuff; `Fech! there's somethin' in it a' ye may depend! cummers!' Suddenly Dominie Spankie recovered his voice and his presence of mind. `Silence!' he shouted, in a voice of thunder, bringing his ferule down on his desk and his foot on the floor, at the same time with terrible emphasis. Instantly the merriment, save one or two faint note from the smaller boys, ceased, and a portentous silence followed. `What means this outrage upon my authority?'—who caused this laughter?' be demanded, in a voice that made the little boys shake in their trowsers, and the larger ones look sufficiently sober. The only reply was a general direction of eyes towards the red brick chimney, which protruded into the room, followed instantly by a suppressed titter from many of the boys, and a loud guffaw, in the back form, from a thick set, clownish, lad, about sixteen years old, who almost suffocated himself with his fist to keep from giving vent to his cachinations. But they were suddenly checked by the `ruler,' which whizzed through the air, glanced by his ear, and buried itself half an inch in the plastering of the wall behind him. The Dominie was foaming with rage and could not even articulate the words commanding him to bring the ruler. The lad, however, from habit, took the instrument in his hand, and leaving his form descended the steep alley between the seats and the desk, and held it forth. For a few seconds the Dominie paced the floor, without taking it or noticing him; at length, having in some degree conquered his surprise at the events he had witnessed, he laid his hand on the boy's shoulder, with a gripe that caused him to roar with pain. `Tell me, Davy Dow,' he cried, in a voice that made the stoutest boy's heart quake, `who and what is the cause of this uproar? Tell me truly, or I will not leave a bone whole in your body!' and he shook him as if he would even then fulfil his threat. `I didn't do it, master,' said the boy as well as he could speak. `What—do what? you scape gallows! do what? you wretched little villain!' shouted the Dominie, lifting him from his feet, and shaking him at arm's length. `Make um laugh, sir. Haw, haw, haw!' `He, he, he!' tittered the school. `What! do I hear laughing again?' almost yelled the Dominie, and his eye followed that of the culprit, in the direction of the chimney. Instantly a change came over his spirit. He beheld, affixed to the chimney, facing him and the whole school, what no man could mistake—an admirable, half-length likeness of himself, caricatured with surpassing skill. His spectacles were pictured, thrown up to the top of his forehead; his ruler was in his hand, as if in the act of being cast at some unruly boy, and he was represented in the act of frowning most terribly. It was the exact image of Dominie Spankie. The likeness ludricrously correct, and he himself, even if he had never looked into a mirror, could not but have recognized it. He did recognize it, and saw at once what had excited the risible muscles of his slaves, (for what were pupils twenty years ago, but slaves, for six hours in a day!) and he trembled with passion. He turned slowly round, and as he did so, the titter, which, as he detected the caricature, had begun to revive, was suddenly suppressed. Every face encountered his dark looks, and a portentous silence filled the room. Each eye was fixed on his, and histo all appearance, was fixed on those of each one. There was a long and portentous silence. At length he spoke. `Davy Dow, you may return to your seat. Henry Irvine, come here!' The permission and command were both given in the calm tones of settled and resolute revenge. The clown obeyed with alacrity; but as he passed the other on his way towards the desk, he whispered to him, `I'll be dom'd if he shall strike you, Henry.' The boy gave him a reproving yet grateful glance, and said, `hush, good Davy, I deserve it now.' The youth who was called, had left his seat with a fearless smile. With a firm, light tread, he descended the alley and stood before the Dominie. He was about sixteen years of age, with a high, white forehead, about which brown hair clustered in the utmost profusion; his eyes were large, black, and sparkling with genius. His face was strikingly handsome, his figure elegant, and his manners graceful. He was evidently far superior to his fellows in birth and mental culture, as well as in person. Henry Irvine was, in the beautiful language of Scripture, `the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.' His father had been the village pastor, until his death, a few years before and his successor taking the parsonage, the widow, with scarce a pittance, (for country clergymen can seldom do more than make both ends meet,) retired to a lowly dwelling, the residence of a widow in humble life, but better circumstances, than herself, who, for a trifling sum, rented her and her son, part of her tenement. But Henry soon lost his remaining parent, and to the widow Dow he looked up as to a second mother, and between himself and her son, though nature had given them minds of a different order there existed the ardent love of twin brothers. Davy was rough in person, and blunt in manners, but he possessed a kind heart, and was capable of strong attachments; and, though a clown, had a breast full of generous feelings to counterbalance his want of refinement. The more cultivated and intellectual Henry, appreciated his warm attachment, though Davy's was an affection more like the shaggy Newfoundland entertains towards a beloved master, than that between two beings whom fortune, not nature, had placed on the same social level. `Thee sha'n't be struck, Henry I'll be dom'd if thee shall,' were words that forcibly illustrated the nature and the strength of the attachment of the faithful peasant. Dominie Spankie drew up his lengthy figure to its full longitude, and bent a withering look upon Henry, who met it with a steady and fearless bearing. There was a dead, expecting silence throughout the room. The humming of fleas that circled above the Dominie's head, was the only thing to be heard. At length he moved to his throne and seat ed himself with direful solemnity. `Henry Irvine stand before me!' He silently obeyed. `I need not ask,' continued he, pointing to the caricature, `if that be thy handy work, for none else in this school hath that gift of the devil's art, save thyself. Confess and deny it not, stripling, that it was thyself who hast vilified thy preceptor: thy pater of learning and letters; the teacher of the humanities to a horde of gracelings like thyself; who hath inducted thee into Zenophon, taught thee the beauties of Cicero, and led thee not a little way into the Hebrew tongue. Say, is it not thou, ungrateful lad, that hast done this thing?' Here the indignant Dominie pointed with his ferule towards the painting, which looked so very like himself in his proper person, that he started at the wonderful likeness, and with his bony hands, stroked his long visage to ascertain, if indeed it was present with him and not in the chimney. `I disdain a falsehood, sir,' replied the boy; `I did do it.' `Ha! you confess, graceless,' he cried, clutching his ferule tightly. `So, now will I make an ensample of thee to the whole school. Hold out your right hand.' The boy, for a moment, held his breath, and compressed his lips as if collecting firmness to undergo the torture, and coolly extended his hand with the open palm upward. It was a soft, elegantly shaped member, and seemed to quiver instinctively at the pain it was about to endure. The ferule of Dominie Spankie was an oaken slab, two feet in length, three inches wide, the thickness of a man's finger and full three pounds in weight. At one extremity it was made concave, like a spoon, for the purpose of raising blisters on the part it came in contact with. By long handling, this instrument of torture, (which is still in vogue in most American country schools,) was highly polished and had become as hard and nearly as dark as ebony. When the offence was not of the first order, or the offender was young, the smooth end of the ferule was graciously used upon his palm; but when the punishment was to be great, the Dominie was seen to turn the ferule end for end, and balance it in his fingers with a gratified look, and more than usual dexterity. There was a vein of cruelty, whether natural, or acquired by a long reign of tyranny, is uncertain, running through the Dominie's composition, and there is no doubt that he delighted in the shrieks of the little victims, and in the blisters and blood that followed his blows as truly as ever did a Spanish Inquisitor, in the sufferings of those that had fallen into his merciless grasp Dominie Spankie screwed up his visage into a devilish expression of malignant triumph as he passed his fingers gently along the ferule, like an executioner feeling his whip, before inflicting the lash, then suddenly up went the heavy weapon, and the next instant it descended upon the hand, with that sharp, peculiar ringing rap, which all my male readers will remember, some, I doubt not, feelingly, while others will not only recognise the ruler in question, but also Dominie Spankie himself, or I have painted his portrait far less skilfully with my pen than the luckless Henry did with the pencil. A second blow, after an interval long enough for the victim to feel the full smart of the pain of the first, fell upon the outstretched palm, now no longer white and soft, but glowing with inflammation. A third, a fourth, and fifth followed, till twelve most cruel and inhuman strokes had lacerated the hand, till both blood and water broke from it, and trickled through its fingers to the ground. The brave boy bore it like a martyr—a martyr he sure was to a system of education disgraceful even to a pagan people, and endurable only in a nation of serfs—yet a system upheld in a Christian land, by ignorant pedagogues and sustained and strengthened by the indifference and fears of parents. What right, moral, social, legal—yea, what right so ever had this man to punish and lacerate this boy? Interrogation crowds upon interrogation, all alike unanswerable. But this is no place to discuss the question, though a volume that would come home to the hearts and feelings of every parent might be written on the subject. `Now the other hand!' said the implacable Dominie, after refreshing himself by drinking the dipper full of water, handed to him by one of the little boys. Not a groan had yet escaped the manly sufferer. He bore this species of bastinado with a fortitude that should have put to blush the savage cruelty that inflicted it. He held forth his left hand and it was in like manner blistered. `Nay, I have not done with you yet, sir,' said the monster, taking a bunch of willow-rods down as the youth turned to go to his seat after the infliction of the last blow. `Take off your jacket.' Hitherto the whole school had looked on with trembling sympathy; one alone, Davy Dow, betraying by his clenched fist, set teeth, and flushed face, his resentment at the cruelty inflicted upon his friend, for whom, had he not been forbidden by him, he would have done battle even with the Dominie: he now impulsively started to his feet, leaned forward over the desk, and shook his fists at him, shouting, `Dom thee, if thou touch 'um again, I'll knock the doon, and be doom'd to thee, if thee 'rt the Dominie!' Without speaking, Dominie Spankie advanced in three strides to the seat of this rebel, seized him by the collar with irresistible force, dragged him across the benches to his desk, and flung him upon the floor with such violence, that for a moment he lay there stunned; then casting a glance of mingled threat and definance over the school, he turned towards Henry Irvine, and repeated his command to take off his coat. `Never, tyrant!' cried Henry, roused rather at his friend's treatment, than on account of his own injuries; `I have borne shame enough. My punishment has already exceeded my offence. I have submitted thus far to corporal chastisement, because it is in conformity to the vile discipline of schools, but I will bear no more, not even on my hand. My back, sir, shall never be bared to the cat! I am no slave, to be whipped with stripes. Custom has made a distinction between blows on the hand and those on the body, and I have hitherto submitted to the least degrading. But I shall do so no longer.' He stepped back as he spoke, and proudly folded his arms. `Strip, sir!' thundered the infuriated Dominie. `Never!' was the quiet and firm reply. `Then I will tear thy garments from thy shoulders, strip thee to the skin, and give thee a castigation that thy upstart pride will not stomach.' `Touch me at your peril,' said the boy, in a determined tone, as the Dominie advanced to seize him. Heedless of the warning and never dreaming of the resistance from a pupil, the furious pedagogue placed his hand upon the shoulder of the spirited lad, and instantly received a blow in the breast that between surprise and pain, caused him to start back. But, recovering himself, he made a second and more furious attempt to seize upon him, when a heavier and well directed blow on the side of the head, from Davy Dow, who had got to his feet, knocked him heavily against the chimney. Before he could recover himself the gallant fellows followed up their success and inflicted upon his sacred person the soundest pummelling ever a magister of a village school received, and one certainly that was most richly deserved. The uproarious shouts of the tiny boys when they saw their master hors du combat; the cries of the terrified little ones; the mingled shouts and hurrahs, who can describe? The terrible ferule was broken in two; the bunch of rods scattered to the winds, by willing hands; and the school-room, save by a few chicken hearted urchins, who, by remaining, hoped to avert the Dominie's wrath when he should recover, was instantly deserted, and the disfranchised boys, half frantic with tremulous joy, were seen flying and shouting in every direction over the green. 2 CHAPTER III. On the opposite side of the mere of Eden, half a mile from the village, was situated a gentleman's seat, with its lawns and gardens extending quite to the water. It was called `Rosemont,' and was the residence of Colonel Odlin, who had distinguished himself in the then recent war of the revolution, and now with fresh military honors, an ample fortune, and an only daughter, had retired to this lovely spot. He was proud and haughty, and educated his daughter in aristocratic seclusion; but nevertheless occasionally permitted her to visit Eden, and once a month attend the village church. Mary Elizabeth Odlin was a sweet, delicate girl, with soft black eyes of the identical rich color of her auburn hair, which at every motion of her head, reflected a sunny hue of gold: her complexion was unsulied as snow, and so transparent was the skin of her hands, temples, and round white neck, that the veins could be followed by the blue tints underneath. She was scarcely sixteen, a little below the middle height, with a round full figure, light and agile in its motion as the pet fawn that accompanied her in all her walks. She had a lively spirit, a gentle temper, a musical laugh, and a smile so sweet and expressive of her happy-heartedness, that one could not look upon, without feeling an interest in her; few saw without loving her. I forgot to say, too, that she sang with great simplicity and taste, several gentle songs; had an exquisite hand and the most loveable little foot in the world. Somehow or other it chanced that Henry Irvine and she had once met, the year before, and from that period, young as they both were, a silent, unspoken, but increasing mutual passion, sprung up in their hearts. At sunset of the day on which the events just related had transpired, Mary was seated in a little favorite bower, at the foot of the garden, that looked upon the water, and from which was a view of the village, spread out before her like a picture, when she descried a boat, containing two persons, put off from the opposite side of the lake, and rapidly approach the spot where she was seated. A glance at the form of the individual in the stern told her that it was none other than Henry; while in the broad shoulders and shaggy bare head of the oarsman, she could not fail to recognize his inseparable companion, Davy Dow. Scarce had the boat touched the snowy beach, ere Mary, who flew to meet it, was in the arms of Henry. They walked together silently for a few moments, beneath the water-oaks that overhung the winding shore, when, after they had retired a little apart from observation, Henry, who, to Mary's surprise, had remained moody as well as silent, and wholly forgetful of his usual lightness of spirits, stopped suddenly, and impressively said to her: `Mary, I have come to bid you good bye.' `Henry!' was the exclamation that escaped her lips at this announcement. `It is true. I leave Eden with the dawn.' `Whither?' `To seek my fortune—and, in after years to return, if you will then have proved true to me, to claim you, dare I say it, as my bride!' He warmly pressed her to his heart as he spoke, and looked anxiously into her face for a reply For a moment, the gentle girl remained silent. The suddenness of the announcement had stunned her, and she was incapable of speaking. At length recovering her usual manner, she said playfully: `You say so but to try my affection, Henry. If this is all you wish, although I ought not to humor you, I will frankly tell you that my love, young as we both are, shall never meet with a change.' `Your father?' `With his approval, always, Henry.' `But the wealthy Colonel Odlin will never approve the love of a poor lad, unknown to birth and fortune.' `My father will ever seek the happiness of his only child Henry; and my happiness never will be sacrificed even to his own pride of birth and fortune.' `Yet thrice has he forbidden me to speak and have you forgotten Mary, when he so rudely thrust me one side, at the church door, when I offered to assist you in descending from the carriage?' `Speak not this now—'twas a hasty act. I wish to learn what you mean by saying you have come to bid me farewell?' `It needs no explanation. I have struck the master a blow, and the whole village has risen against me. Even my good foster mother, if I may call her such, has forbidden me the shelter of her roof, until I have asked the tyrant's pardon.' `And you will not?' `And I will not.' `I am very sorry this has chanced! You have been inprudent and over-hasty, I fear, Henry. Your temper is too quick to take fire at every spark that comes in contact with it. What could have provoked you to so rash a thing! Sacrilege would scarce have been a greater crime in the eyes of the villagers.' `He bade me take off—but no, I will not speak of it,' he said blushing with mingled shame and indignation, `let it suffice, Mary, that he insulted me, and I struck him.' `That 'a did, Miss Mary,' said Davy, who had approached them unperceived, `and I hut un a dig i' the ribs, too, that knock'd the wind oot 'o the body on un. Young Measter Henry was right, and had he no' licked the Measter, I fegs! I'd a felt mighty like lickin' Henry myself, savin' your presence, Miss Mary; and so I came to tell yees yer father is coomin doon the walk, and might'nt altogether—yer know Master Henry—' here Davy completed his intelligence with a wink and a hieroglyphical screwing up of his face that was easily interpreted by the lovers. `I must leave you dearest,' said Henry quickly. Go and shove off the boat, Davy. Farewell Mary, dear Mary,' he would have said more, but the fullness of his heart impeded utterance. `Whither do you go, Henry?' she asked, lifting her face wet with tears, from his shoulder. `To Philapelphia, to carve out my own fortunes—to accomplish something, dearest girl, to make me worthy of you. Will you love me while I am absent?' `Love you, Henry dearest! how can you doubt me?' `Will you promise, then, to wait for me seven years? If you do not hear from me then either for good or for evil, you shall then be free. `I promise to be yours and none other's while life lasts,' she replied earnestly. `I ask only for seven years. Will you promise?' `promise,' she said fervently and affectionately. `God bless you, then, Mary! I shall have something to cheer my exile. I shall not return until Colonel Odlin, haughty as he is, shall take me by the hand with pride, and in that hand place the trembling little member I now clasp in it. Adieu, adieu, dearest. When you next hear from me it will be with honor. Only be true to me.' `Do you see those twin stars, just appearing in the evening sky?— they shall be emblems of our love. Look at them often, when absent far from me, and doubt it not!' A hasty embrace—a passionate kiss—the first he had ever placed upon her sweet mouth, and they had parted. The boat containing the fading figure of Henry shot rapidly across the lake, while Mary turning to meet her parent, joined him before he reached the bottom of the avenue, or had described them, and returned with him sllently and sadly towards the house. CHAPTER IV. It was known throughout the village, long before the close of the succeeding day, that Henry Irvine had suddenly and secretly departed from his native village, no one knew whither: and thereupon great was the triumph of Dominie Spankie and his adherents. It would occupy more space than we have allowed ourselves in the compass of this sketch, to recount the adventures of the high spirited boy ere he fairly entered the path by which he was to travel onward to fortune, fame, and felicity. He arrived in Philadelphia pennyless and friendless, without definite aim or object, resting his hopes of success solely on the confused, but too frequent erroneous notion, common with the country lads of his native state, that there, and there alone he could make his fortune. Aside from his own peculiar case, far better, indeed, would it have been now for thousands of such if they had staid at home to till the soil or labor at the bench of the mechanic. With a small pack lashed to his back, a staff in his hand, and his garments travel-worn and dusty, he entered the city by the Schuylkill bridge, an hour before sunset of the third day after his departure from Eden; and after winding through several streets, he found himsel lounging down the great thoroughfore of Chestnut street, staring at the numerous gay signs and novel sights that every where met his rustic gaze; the while diligently pondering in his mind which of the countless means of livelihood in which he saw the citizens engaged, he should select, and make the first step towards the accomplishment of his high objects. As he gazed into the dazzling windows of a jeweller's shop, he thought he should like to be a jeweller; but he thought of Col. Odlin, and shook his head. `He will never give his daughter to a mechanic!' was his mental language. `Yet why should he not?' was the question that irrestibly forced itself upon his ingenuous mind. `Should I not still be Henry Irvine, whether I were a mechanic or a merchant?' He could not answer his own query; and being puzzled by the nice distinctions that society has formed, he turned from the showy window and continued his walk. `Shall I be a storekeeper?' he inquired, as he observed the well-dressed young men that were selling silks and muslins across mahogony counters to beautiful women. He watched them with an observing air, for a few seconds, and then turning away, said, `No, I feel within me that I am destined for a more manly and a far higher destiny, than I see this to be.' `Thus, in turn, every pursuit offered itself, for the passing moment to his choice, and each, in turn, as it was presented, was mentally rejected. At length a small, unassuming sign, caught his attention, on which he read in gilded characters, “R. Peale, Portrait Painter.” The last words arrested his eye, and he repeated them aloud, while a glow of surprise and pleasure lighted up his countenance. After surveying the sign fixedly a few seconds, as if his glance fascinated, he struck the end of his staff energetically upon the pavement, and exclaimed, `I will become a painter!' `Will you, my lad?' said a pleasant voice near him. He looked up with surprise, and saw a middle aged gentleman, with a gold headed cane in his hand, and a benovolent, yet highly intellectual countenance, standing in the door and gazing on him with that friendly air and look of interest which is so readily translated and appreciated by a stranger among strangers. Henry blushed on finding himself so particularly the object of attention, and stammered something he knew not what, in his confusion; but instantly recovering himself, encouraged by the kind manner of the gentleman, he repeated, with modest firmness: `Yes sir, I would like to become a painter.' `Come into my studio, then. Perhaps you would be pleased to look at some of the paintings there.' `With the greatest pleasure in the world, sir,' said Henry, while his face beamed with gratitude and delight. He then quickly followed him into an upper room, which was lined on every side with dark green cloth; and he observed that the only light it received came in through the top of a single window, which to subdue its strength and properly temper it, was covered with fine white tissue paper, notwithstanding the softened character of the light and the smallness of the aperture, it did not escape him that it was so managed as far better to show what was in the room, than the glare of noon-day from many windows could do. The apartment was hung round with pictures, more in number than Henry before believed were in the whole world put together; and, for a few moments after entering, he remained silent, with mingled wonder and astonishment. A new creation seemed to have broken upon him. He at first looked about wholly bewildered. Gradually, at length, he grew familiarized with the scene, and wandered from picture to picture with that reverent delight which true genius, in such a situation, alone can experience. The benevolent painter watched him, with a gratified smile on his benign countenance; and after enjoying for some time the unsophisticated rapture of the rustic youth, a thought seemed suddenly to strike him; for going to a corner of the room, he drew from a pile of dusty paintings, an old piece of canvass, on which was painted an unfinished head of St. John by Michael Angelo, and, as if by accident, placed it in the range of his vision. Henry glanced at the old painting, an instant, and was about to pass on to a fresh and brilliant picture, by a modern artist, when something in the head arrested his attention. He stopped and gazed upon it steadily for a few seconds, and with increasing wonder; and while he looked, his eye lighted up with the fire of enthusiasm—the blood leaped to his temples—his breath came and went quick, and finally, clasping his hands together, he bent forward in the involuntary attitude of adoration; then, as if gradually over-come by the presence of the spirit of genius, he slowly dropped upon one knee, and said in tones of awe: `It is the work of God and not of man!' The painter awed by the wonderful impression the head had made upon the boy, struck by the extraordinary language he had given utterance to, and affected by the sublimity of the whole scene, gazed upon him for a moment with wonder and admiration; then springing forward, he caught him in his embrace, and burst into tears. `The Spirit of God is in the child!' he cried, `and Heaven has directed thy wandering footsteps hither. Henceforward we will part not till the pupil shall have excelled the master.' CHAPTER V. Seven years had nearly passed away since the departure of Henry Irvine from his native village, when one morning, at the breakfast table, Colonel Odlin, as was his custom, opened his newspaper, the old `Philadelphia Gazette,' which came to him in those days, regularly once a week, and prepared leisurely to discuss it over coffee: an Epicuerean method of breakfasting, to which retired old gentlemen, particularly if they have been in the army, are much given. Mary, his blooming daughter-sat opposite, presiding over the coffee-urn. She was now in the ripeness of her beauty; and in her lovely face and form, all that the bud had promised was realized. She had continued to cherish her young love for Henry, absence serving rather to strengthen rather than diminish it; yet, from the evening he had parted with her on the shore of the little lake, she had received from him no intelligence whatever. But, with a true woman's constancy and hope, measuring his love by her own, she felt assured that wherever he was, he continued faithful, and would, within the time he had promised, return to claim her hand. `I wonder who this young American painter can be, who makes so much noise in the world,' said Colonel Odlin, pushing back his spectacles and laying down the paper beside him, while he drank his coffee. `I scarcely, of late, take up a newspaper that I do not find an eulogium on this young artist. Really, I am proud of my country, girl,' he continued, with animation; `we shall yet, believe me, give lessons to England both in the arts and literature as well as we have already done in arms.' The attention of Mary was immediately awakened; for all mystery connected with young aspirrnts for fame, had an interest for her; her thoughts, moreover, were at that moment, running on her absent lover and his probable career, and the words of her father, indifferent as they would have been to an ordinary listener, instantly roused her curiosity. `Do you mean that extraordinary genius, who is now in England?' she asked with assumed carelessness `Who else, child? I am proud of him, and his country should be proud of him. She should welcome him with open arms when he returns! What class of men reflect such glory on an age and country as painters? They are the pet children of genius, and their pathway, above that of all other men, is heavenward, and honor and glory encompass them in their upward flight, like a shining cloud. Listen to this, and see if it does not cause your American blood to mount to your brow with national pride!' and setting his glasses to suit his vision, the ardent old soldier read aloud from the Gazette, the following paragraph: `We learn with great pleasure that Peale's celebrated pupil, whose brilliant career we have often had occasion to allude to in our columns, has at length left Rome, where by the force of genius alone— for to birth and parentage we learn he owes nothing, both being alike involved in obscurity—he has held rank with nobles and princes, and from all classes received the homage due to his commanding talents. The London paper from which we obtain our information, also says, that `it having been his intention to return somewhat leisurely from Italy to the United States, he has taken England in his way, where, his fame having preceded him, he has drawn from their Majesties the most flattering personal attention. At their command, he has consented to delay his departure for America, until he has taken portraits, not only of their Majesties, but of the whole royal family. The Duke of Sussex and the Earl of Wellesley, both sat to him in Rome, some months since, of whom he has taken most extraordinary likenesses, the truth of which is only surpassed by the spirit and beauty of the execution. These will be, in a few days, placed in the royal gallery:— We congratulate this distinguished young painter's countrymen on the possession of an artist of such high merit, and console ourselves that genius belongs to no land nor realm; but, inasmuch as its empire is over the intellect, so is its dwelling place only limited by the boundaries that confine the immortal mind. We learn that it is his intention to return to America as soon as he shall have fulfilled his present engagemens to their majesties.' `There, my daughter, is a man whom men should delight to honor. The title genius has given him is a far nobler one than the noblest the patent of a king can confer.' Mary assented in her heart to these sentiments of her father, but did not open her lips, for her thoughts were busy, her ideas confused —her hopes, feelings, wishes, all in commotion. His name, strangely enough, was not given in the paper, and the impression singularly and unaccountably forced itself, each moment increasing in strength upon her mind, that the young painter was the exiled Henry. At length as thought built itself on thought it almost reached positive conviction in her mind. `If you hear of me, it will be with honor!' She remembered these parting words, and also called to mind that talent for sketching which had been the cause of their separation.— `Oh, if it should indeed be Henry!' and the ambition of her love which would give its object no inferior station among men, whispered her to cherish the hope. CHAPTER VI. Three months elapsed after the breakfast scene, described in the last chapter, about dusk, one Sabbath evening, two persons might have been seen in close conference beside the hedge under the window of the humble cottage of the Widow Dow. The figure of one was partly concealed by the foliage, but a close veil and a large shawl thrown across the shoulders as if for disguise, betrayed it to be a female. Through all her attempts at concealment, however, there shone a certain feminine grace, which, with a particularly neat foot, and a hall visible snowy hand betrayed her rank to be above that of a village maiden. Her companion was a stout, good-looking young countryman, in the plain and homespun garb of a ploughman. `It is my wish, Davy,' said she, as if enforcing some request, and it is for his sake, too, that it is to be done.' `Yes, Miss Mary; but it may not turn out to be young Measter Irvine, after all,' responded Davy Dow, whom the lapse of seven years had little changed, save in stature and breadth of shoulders. `I know that it is he, Davy,' said Mary Odlin, with confidence; `the newspaper that came this morning, after stating that this distinguished painter had returned to Philadelphia and taken a studio in Chestnut street, describes, in one short paragraph his personal appearance, and it is just that of Henry as my fancy would paint him as being. My heart tells me that none but himself could have sat for the picture. You must go, Davy.' `Well, Miss Mary, I love Measter Irvine, thof I haint seen un for seven years, as much as I did the day I holped him thrash the Dominie. You must make all right with old measther here, if I go, Miss Mary, and I'm off; and, I fegs, if he be doon to the city I'll hunt him out, and give him the letter and ring; and I don't know which will make him most glad to see me or get a letter from you. I'm most sartain both on us coming together'll go noigh on to upset him.' `You are the kind, obliging, good creature I ever thought you were, Davy. Be speedy, and only be successful, and I will not only reward you well, but do all in my power to forward your suit with my maid, Bessy. `He, ge, ge! you knows it, Miss Mary, do ye? Well, it's truth: I does love un, and if ye can only make her say yes, some Sunday night, when I pops the question, it 'ill be all the reward I want for going.— So I'll be up and off by the dawn, and thoff it's a pretty smart chance of a road, I'll make Snowy pace it in less than two days.' `Don't be imprudent, Davy, mind, and see that no one knows your business nor from whom you are going. Steal away before day break and I will take care that Dame Dow be made easy in your absence. Here is silver to defray your expenses. Do not forget now, on your arrival in the city, to visit, as I before told you, every painter's room until you discover him: his face you cannot have forgotten, and seven years will have altered it little save by the addition of manly graces. Now, God speed thee and give thee success in thy errand.' She retreated, as she spoke, hastily, down the green lane, at the end of which is a rustic bridge, that crosses the stream before it empties itself into the mere, by which she reached Rosemont again without detection. The ensuing morning, at day-break, our Mercury, Davy Dow, stole from his rude bed to the stable, and speedily saddled a diminutive, bob-tailed, crow-black pony, of no particular breed, which he had perversely christened Snowball or Snowy. He then placed across his back a pair of saddle-bags, well filled with meat, bread, apples and dough-nuts, and mounting him, after he had carefully secured the stable-door, he was soon trotting briskly past the school-house, where Dominie Spankie still continued to reign more terrible than ever; and just as the sun began to flush the eastern skies, he turned into the turnpike at the spot where the venerable finger-board points back to Eden, and, at a vigorous pace, pursued his way towards the metropolis. CHAPTER VII. The third day after the departure of Davy, on his Quixotic expedidition, the several artists of Philidelphia were thrown into amusing consternation by the apparation of a clownish young countryman, wearing a homespun frock, and hob-nail shoes, and carrying a small cart-whip, deliberately stalking into their studios, and without casting a glance upon the works of art around, approaching, and looking them as closely in the countenance as they themselves had ever done sitters; and then with a negative shake of the head, quietly disappearing without having spoken a word. Early in the afternoon of the same day, a certain young painter of that city was seated in his studio, which, though a plain green room, and containing but few pictures for display, was situated in the most fashionable part of the town. His head was covered with a crimson Turkish cap; a gorgeous oriental dressing gown enveloped his manly and elegant person, and his feet were thrust into Indian slippers, richly embroidered with bead-work. He had just dismissed a fair sitter, and was still seated before his easel, contemplating the beautiful pictures that had risen beneath the magical touches of his pencil. While thus occupied, the door opened softly, and first the head, and then the shoulders, of a countryman, were thrust in. The owner of these after taking a survey of the room, then advanced his whole body, and slowly approached the artist, as if to obtain a sight of his features, which were hidden by the canvas before him, and which he was so intently studying as to be unconscious of the presence of an intruder. The countryman, who was Davy Dow, in proper person, at length, by thrusting his head over the top of the canvas, got sight of the painter's face. It was shaded to the eyes by the drooping fold of his velvet cap, and partly covered by his right palm and fore-finger, on which his cheek thoughtfully leaned. Davy looked hard and scrutinizingly, but the singularity of his costume, with the attitude, defeated his scrutiny. But he was not to be foiled in his object, and it occurred to him that there was something in the shape of the symmetrical and gentlemanly hand that reminded him of his foster-brother—for the expression of the hand—so to express that which all have noticed, is the last to change. In his anxiety to get a better view of the face, he struck his foot against a limb of the easel. The artist started, and looking up, beheld, to his infinite surprise, the broad visage of Davy staring down upon him over the top of the picture. The instant Davy saw his face, browned and manly, yet about the forehead and eyes almost transparent with intellect, the lip darkened by a moustache, and the face classically oval, with parted hair, flowing to the shoulders, from beneath his cap, he started in his turn. In it his duller vision saw no trace of the fair boy that shared his sports in childhood. `Dang it, he be a Turk and no Christian!' he ejaculated, after surveying him a few seconds; being bewildered by the picturesque costume as well as confused by the stern, inquiring look that sought his. `What, sir?' demanded the artist, not comprehending Davy's words. `Nothing, your worship. It is of no sort o' consequence—a bit o' a mistake—into the wrong shop, sir—no offence, I hope, sir!' and thus speaking, Davy bowed himself backwards as for as the door, and then made his escape from the room with extraordinary precipitation. The artist gave a few moments' thought to the oddity of the interruption, and then taking up his pencil, began to work upon the picture, touching and adding grace to each feature, and blending in the higher parts of expression from memory. These touches were more delicate and truthful than those which he had mechanically copied from the face of the sitter; for fancy and taste combined with the restless spirit of creating the beautiful, will then always insensibly guide the artist's pencil, and mingle themselves with his colors. After a while, he stopped abruptly, and spoke half aloud, his mind having evidently dwelt on the recent circumstances while his pencil moved over his canvas. `Certainly, I have seen that broad, honest face before. Where can I have encountered its owner?' He seemed to be recalling the past for a moment, and then shook his head sorrowfully. `Ah, gentle Mary! I wonder if you have continued true to me! Two days longer this picture will detain me here, and I will then know in person. In disguise will I revisit my native village, and from her own lips, myself unknown to her, draw the evidence of her truth or unfaithfulness!—How strange it is that the face of this clown should bring Eden so vividly to memory. I have, at length, gained a name, Colonel Odlin need not be ashamed to acknowledge. I know his passion and taste for the fine arts. I trust much to this for success, if Mary should have proven true. I wonder if she has altered much?' As he spoke, he rose, and removing the canvas from the easel, replaced it by a half finished portrait, the original of which could not be mistaken. `How like her as she was when we last met!' he said, contemplating with a lover's gaze, the fair resemblance of Mary Odlin. `Perhaps she is much altered now, but it is only to be still lovelier.' He continued to gaze awhile longer on the picture which he had sketched, of Mary in the bloom of sweet sixteen as she was pictured on his memory, and then, rising, threw aside his gown and cap, replaced them with a coat and hat, and after another passionate glance at the the portrait, replaced it by the one he had removed, and descended to the street. As he passed out of the door to the pavement, he saw his late visitor, standing with his face close to his sigh, which he was spelling over and over again, with great care, Henry, Portrait and Historical Painter.' `That's half o' the name, and no mistake. It may be him and it mayn't be! but dang me if he didn't look like a Turk up there. But the chap I see might not ha' been the painter. `Henry!—Henry! I wonder if he ha'n't got no pitcher to his handle! Henry what? May be its Mr. Henry. Gad! I'll go in again, after I have been round to the Indian Queen tavern, and got a snack, for its nigh on to three o'clock, and I ha'n't had no dinner yet. If it's Mr. Henry, 'ta'n't Master Henry, that's all. But its so pesky near it, I'll give another trial. For none o' the other painters look any more like Henry than me old grandmother.' There was something in the tones and manner of the speaker, that arrested the painter's attention. He involuntarily stopped and was about to address him, when Davy strode away beyond his reach, and doubtless, very soon afterwards was regaling himself at the inn, with bread, cheese, and dough-nuts. Two hours afterwards, on returning to his room, which, as most artists are wont to do, he had left unlocked, he discovered, seated in his chair before the easel, and gazing with looks of surprise and gratification upon the sitter's portrait he had replaced there, no less person than his former rustic visitor. He surveyed him a moment with a smile, and then approaching him, slapped him good humoredly on the back, and said: `You seem to be fond of paintings, my good friend!' `Noa, measter, not particularly,' said Davy, quietly looking up from the canvas; `Ise ony waitin' here for the painter.' The voice and face of the speaker brought back to the artist his boyhood. He scanned his features with eager curiosity, as if he sought to trace there familiar lines. But the tan of the sun and the seasons, combined with a heavy beard, defeated his scrutiny. Davy, in his turn, stared at the painter, his face alternately lighted up with hope, and clouding with doubt, as at one moment he thought he detected a resemblance, which, the next instant, was replaced by an expression altogether strange to him. On the part of the young painter, conviction grew to certainty, that an old companion of boyhood stood before him: but, as if prompted by a sudden thought, which suggested a plan for the better confirmation of his suspicions, he removed the picture from the easel, and silently, with a half smile, replaced it by one covered by a cloth, which hitherto had stood against the wall, and then said: `I was about to ask your name, my good friend; for your face reminds me most forcibly, of one I knew in my boyhood; but I chose to satisfy myself by means of my art. Look at this picture,' he added, removing the cover; `if you recognize it, I think I shall not be at a a loss to call you by name without asking it. Stand here before it!' Davy took the position he pointed out, and had no sooner fastened his eyes upon the canvas, then they seemed to start from their sockets with mingled surprise and bodily fear. He stepped back, again advanced, and then bent his face closer to it as if scarcely believing his eyes for wonder; finally, he stooped down before it, with both hands, from one of which stuck out the handle of his inseparable cart whip, resting on his thighs, and gazed upon it until a broad smile of amusing recognition, illumined her ruddy visage. Near him, with his pencil extended in one hand, and his pallette elevated in the other, stood the painter, watching every expression in his face, and enjoying in triumph, the anticipated success of his art. All at once, Davy drew back, and doubling his massy fist, said, while he shook it at the canvas, `If thee beest no' Dominie Spankie, thee beest the dev'l!' Then turning and looking at the amused artist, he added, `There be but one could do that, and if thee beest not not Measter Henry—' `Then,' interrupted the Artist, smiling; `thou art not Davy Dow.' `Odds butters! Bessy's mine, Bussy's mine!' he cried, capering round the studio. `Give us thee hand, Measter Henry! Dod! it's thyself after all, then! How thee hast shot up; and the tan has made thee brown as a hazle-nut; and what with that whisker on your upper lip, I'd barely know'd thee, but for the Dominie, here. I know'd nobody could ha' done him but you. Well, it's odd, the old chap's picture should ha' made you go off, at first, and then be the means o' making me find you again.' The two friends cordially shook hands, and Henry passed one of the pleasantest hours since his exile in reviving old associations with the communicative Davy. That Mary formed the burden of the numerous questions he put to his foster-brother, need not be told. At length, Davy began to feel in the capacious pockets of his frock as if suddenly recollecting that he had not delivered all his message `Dang it, Measter Henry, what with talking 'bout the Dominie, and the gals, and the old women, I'd loike to a' forgot! Here's a bit of a letter and a round gold ring for ye!' Henry seiezed them with eagerness, while a heightened color betrayed the state of his heart. He kissed the silent token, and placed it on his finger, and then tore open the letter. It contained but a single word: `Come. `Mary.' `I obey!' he exclaimed. `How do you go back, Davy?' `On Snowy. He's at the tavern, and if you'll ride him, Measter Henry, I'll foot it along side, bad as I feel to get back to Eden to see Bessy.' `No thank you, good Davy. I will take the stage. You can return at once, and bear this seal to her, and—' `To Bessy?' `To Bessy! No, you ninny—to Mary.' He gave, as he spoke to Davy, a small signet, in which was cut the metto, `My heart is with you.' `Tell her in three days I shall be at Rosemont.' In a few minutes afterwards, Davy took his leave, and by sun-rise the next morning, was several miles on his way to Eden, the image of his Bessy filled his thoughts and added speed to his progress. CHAPTER VIII. The day after Davy's secret departure, on his search for Henry, whom he so happily discovered, Colonel Odlin received a letter relating to some financial matters, that required his presence for a few days in the city. He immediately left Rosemont, accompanied by his daughter, and arrived the evening of the day on which Davy left, without having met him on the road. Instead of going to the Indian Queen, then the most respectable inn, (not hotel,) of the town, they drove directly to the residence of an old friend who had recently been united to a very lovely woman, and lived in much style in Walnut street. The portrait on which Henry was at work when Davy first entered his studio, was that of Mrs. Astley. It chanced to be the subject of conversation the next morning at the breakfast table, and the highest encomiums were passed by the Dr. and Mrs. Astley, not only upon it as a likeness and work of art, but upon the painter. `Who is he?' asked Colonel Odlin, with interest. `The American Angelo.' `What, the celebrated young American painter, who has recently been received with such distinction in England?' `The same,' replied Dr. Astley. `It is but a few weeks since he returned to this country; and it is only at the request of several of our most eminent citizens, and even of General Washington, who is 3 to sit to him, that he has consented to remain with us a few days; being anxious to visit his native village, somewhere in the interior of the state. You must see him, and get your head taken off,' added the doctor laughing. `I will accompany you and the ladies to his rooms, this morning, before I go to the bank. I have great curiosity to form his acquaintance. His country should be proud of him.' `Ay, indeed, should they,' responded the Doctor; `but look at my fair friend Mary! Her face glows with something like pride in him already. Why girl, you would fall in love with him at sight! He is not a bad favored young gentleman, by any means. Who knows, Colonel, what may happen? A man who has raised himself to be the associate of princes and nobles of Europe, simply by the aid of his genius, may be a match for any woman. `I should be honored by such a son-in-law,' said Colonel Odlin, smiling, and looking towards Mary. She felt confused and distressed, why, she scarcely knew; and felt relieved when the party rose from the table. She was not sure that the painter was Henry. She darred not ask Dr. Astley his name; still her love would not let her doubt, and so she believed. CHAPTER VIII. Henry Irvine was seated in his studio that morning, busily at work. On the easel before him stood a piece of canvas, on which he had been painting for several hours, with the animated and glowing countenance of one whose soul was lost in the subject. The door opened, and the party from Dr. Astley's entered. Observing him so deeply absorbed in his task, they did not interrupt him, but lounged through the room, inspecting the creations of his pencil, and admiring some pictures of the old master of painting which he had brought from from Italy, leaving him to discover their presence at his leisure. Mary Odlin leaned upon the arm of Dr. Astley as they traversed the room but from a singular feeling, easily understood but difficult to analyze she dared not turn her eyes towards the artist. A single glance she knew would satisfy her if it was Henry; but she felt it might also crush at once the hopes she had so fondly cherished. She trembled at hastening the denouement, and chose rather to nourish the delusion, if delusion it was, to the latest moment, than risk the chance of final disappointment. She feared, too, if it should prove to be Henry, to meet his eye before so many, and her emotion at the discovery should be observed. As they slowly made the tour of the apartment, Mrs. Astley, whose curiosity was awakened to know whether it could be her own picture that so closely engaged the whole mind of the handsome young artist as to render him unconscious of their presence, crossed the room in such a direction, that by slightly bending forward, she could discover the subjecton the canvas. Her eye had scarcely glanced at it, when she uttered an exclamation of surprise and delight, and cried, `The living image of Mary Odlin, as I knew her when she was scarce sixteen!' He started with surprise, blushed, stammered out a few incoherent words of spology for not before aware of their presence, and hastily turned the canvas to the easel—but not before Colonel Odlin had seen and recognized an admirable portrait of his daughter, just as she was merging into womanhood. Mary heard the words of Mrs. Astley, and her heart told her that the limner could be none other than Henry! She raised her eyes—it was Henry! She uttered a cry of delight, and would have fallen with joy, had not the young artist, who at the same instant recognized her, flown and caught her in his arms. The moment she felt his arms around her, she quickly recovered herself with maidenly shame, and buried her blushing, happy face in her hands! `What means this?' inquired Colonel Odlin, bewildered by the scene, wholly at loss to account for his daughter's emotion, and puzzling himself with conjectures how her portrait came to be on the painter's easel. `Cupid has something to do it, Colonel, I will wager,' said Dr. Astley, with a mischevous glance at Mary. `Did I not tell, you, fair lady, it would be love at first sight!' `It is something more,' said Colonel Odlin; `will you do us the kindness to explain, sir?' he added, addressing Henry `Cheerfully sir,' said Henry taking the hand of Mary, which she willingly resigned to him. `In early youth your lovely daughter was beloved by me, and I had reason to hope my love was reciprocated. But my birth is humble, and also were my fortunes. That I might make myself worthy of her, seven years ago I left my native village, to seek my fortune, and strive to win a name, in the lustre of which, whispered my youthful ambition, my lowly one should be lost. For that purpose, I assumed only my christian name, with the determination to resume my paternal one only when I could with honor confer it on her, who was the guiding star of my career. Seven years we promised to be true to each other, trusting to better fortunes, at the expiration of that period, to reward our loves. It is just seven years to-day, sir, since we parted, on the shore of Eden Mere.' `In Henry, the painter,' exclaimed Colonel Odlin, with astonishment, `I then behold—' `Henry Irvine,' replied the young artist, bowing with modest pride. `Take her, young man. She is fairly won. Yours is a patent of nobility derived from Heaven, and sealed with the signet of a Divinity. Nor are you so lowly by birth. Your father though a poor clergyman, was a gentleman and a scholar!' As he spoke, he took the hand of the happy Mary and placed it himself in that of her lover, embraced them both, and in an affectionate manner bade, `God bless them!' `Amen!' fervently responded Dr. Astley. A few weeks afterwards, the village of Eden was beside itself with merry-makings in honor of the marriages of Henry Irvine with Mary Odlin, and of David Dow with Bessy Blodget. THE END.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE BOLD INSURGENT. CHAPTER I. `Death keep him close— We have too many Divells still goe loose. —Bacon's Eulogy. Scene in the Tap-Room. In the reign of Charles, the Second of England, Sir William Berkley was Governor of Virginia, then a pet province of royalty, and receiving more of the sunshine of kingly favor than any other of the American plantations. It was settled principally by cavaliers of this prince's ill-fated father's court, and a party, who, to escape the retributive vengeance of Cromwell, sought here an asylum from the politcal tempest that laid waste their fair island. Here took refuge many of the first Charles' personal friends and most devoted adherents; and with but few exceptions, all of these transferred their royalty and affection from the father to the son. After the restoration, they would have willingly returned from their exile, and were making preparations to do so, when the second Charles, desirous of giving consideration to the province through the presence there of wealth and family, courteously signified that it was his royal wish that they should remain there, and by their presence and influence, countenance the infant colony, which, on their departure, would languish and die. The expression of the royal desire was to them a command; and Virginial became permanently the home of some of the best descended cavaliers of Great Britain, whose descendants, in this day, have parted not with the high tone of gallantry and chivalrous bearing which characterized the gentleman of the court of the unfortunate Charles. The presence of so large a number of good families, who instead of coming to acquire wealth, brought it with them with all its refinements, combined with the peculiar favor the colony received from the parent country, contributed to place Virginia far before its sister colonies in luxuries which the latter only finally arrived to the enjoyment of, after years of patient and laborious toil. This peculiarity was apparent, and distinctly marked as early as the period of our story; and a century and a half has scarcely diminished the claim of the `Old Dominion' to this distinctive feature. The colonists were composed principally of planters, gentlemen of estate, King's officers, military men, with the persons composing the council and court of Sir William Berkley. Mechanics, there were few or none, as all manufactured articles were imported from the mother country, from a hat down to a shoe, and oftentimes, also, the entire frames of dwelling houses and public edifices. Poor white laborers were also rare, as all work was done by slaves. Loafers were not known then. It was emphatically a colony of gentlemen! Their estates extended on both sides of James River, many a league, and along both shores of the Chesapeake. Jamestown was the seat of colonial government, the residence of Sir William Berkley; and the centre of all provincial events. Here the governor held his court; here met the assembly, and here were the head-quarters of the troops. This town, at the period of our story, in 1675, extended along a rambling street that run parallel with James, then called Powhattan River, for about three quarters of a mile, and faced the south. The place on which it was built, was a peninsula formed by a creek, that, approaching within a few rods of James River, above the town, turned with a broad sweep, off suddenly to the left, quite encompassing the town, and emptied itself into the river two miles below it. The neck that joined the peninsula thus formed, to the main land, was but ten paces in breadth, and across it run the only road that led from the town to the interior. Besides the state-house, which was an imposing brick structure, with a portico and gallery, the governor's residence, just out of the village, and a church with a lower tower, there was no other public building in town, unless the hostel of Katrine Larence be thus designated. Katrine had been the prettiest maiden, the loveliest bride, and the handsomest widow in the whole plantation. At the time this story opens, she had remained in widowhood twelve years, the whilst mistress and hostess of the most notable public house in Virginia; `the resorte,' says the historian, `of all the gentry and best quality of the colony whom business and cencours to the governor brought to town from all parts.' One stormy night, several of her guests were congregated in the tap-room, the chief window of which looked towards the council hall of the state-house. It was the night before the meeting of the provincial assembly, and the inn was filled with the members that represented different parts of the colony, and, as the custom then was, most of them were gathered in the tap-room after supper, previous to retiring for the night. The company was divided or separated into four or five groups. Around the fire, (for the night, though a late one, was damp and chilly, and a fire comfortable,) was drawn a knot of the members, discussing the anticipated affairs of the morrow, on the opening of the assembly. They were mostly dressed in the broad skirted coats, flapped waistcoats, breeches and knee-buckles, with the queued and powdered hair of the period. In the middle of the floor, seated around a table, was a group of town's people, from their dress and conversation, evidently merchants and ship-masters, talking of gains, of winds, and of foreign lands. In a corner of the apartment were several seamen, riotously drinking and singing over oft replenished cups of gin or claret, while in the opposite corner, as if seeking to shun observation, were two swarthy and painted Indians, with bundles of furs at their feet, bargaining in low guttural tones with a little fat, shrewd `leader' of the town, who displayed, in his hands, gay beads, brass rings, and other tempting trinkets, as the price of their beaver-skins. On one side of the long, low apartment, was a semicircular pulpit, well guarded by an oaken lattice, and communicating with a window in the rear, with an inner room. This was the `bar' or `tap' of the inn, and its presiding deity none other than Katrine herself, who was leaning over its counter, and talking with a tall handsome man, not above thirty years of age, who, while listening to her with courteous attention, was marking all that passed among the several groups in the tap-room. This man was finely formed, and wore a costume half that of a hunter, and half military, which exceedingly became him, while it set off to advantage the firm proportions of his well built frame. His whole air, his subdued and calm manner, as well as the richness of some parts of his dress, showed him to be a man of birth and bearing. His eye was grey and large, and clear like an eagle's, while his mouth wore that firm expression that indicated courage, daring, and a high and fierce spirit. His complexion was florid, his forehead partly shaded by a low Virginia palm hat, was broad and smooth; while the strength of his noble, but stern brows was relieved by clustering locks of light brown hair that escaped from his hat, and rested upon his temples. A light, elegant mustache graced his upper lip, and a peaked, well trimmed beard descended to his breast. He wore a straight sword at his side, and in his belt was stuck a pistol, and a long two-edged hunting-knife. His smile was pleasant, and the few low words he from time to time returned for the courteous flow of gossip with which Katrine entertained him, seemed, from her frequent laughs, not only to give her great pleasure, but to be sufficiently well-timed—notwithstanding he was all the while more intent in listening to the conversation of those about the fire-place, than to her. `Come, Colonel,' she said at length, seeing that he thought less of her words than he seemed to; `leave the tap-room, and go back into the little parlor, where thy supper is laid. There is wine and warm welcome for thee there.' `Such welcome were a thing not lightly to be turned from, Katrine,' he said, but I pray thee let me listen a-while to these cavaliers. Their discourse hath especial interest for me.' `It is nothing but dry assembly talk; I hear it from morning 'till night, until I wish there was no such thing as politics in the world.' `Were there no politics, dame, thou would'st scarce have so crowded a hotel as thou hast this night,' answered the cavalier. `That is true; but we need not listen to them.' `Go, Katrine, I will presently follow thee, and do justice to thy board.' Thus speaking, he quitted the easy, lounging posture he had hitherto assumed, as he leaned with his ear towards the hostess, and moved, as if with careless purpose, towards the fire-place, yet not so near as to attract observation by the act. `These painted pagans that so infest our borders with fire and death in their train, must be exterminated,' said one of the older gentlemen of the group, continuing the conversation, and striking his gold-headed staff upon the hearth, to enforce, by its emphasis, his energetic words. `They have, a second time, come within thirty miles of Jamestown, and the light of their war-fires has illuminated the horizon of our very capital,' said another. `Why Sir William does not send out troops to protect the frontier, and punish these savages, is better known to himself than it is to me.' `Sir William Berkley, our excellent governor, hath too much wisdom to shoot bullets through beaver-skins,' sqeaked a low, chuckling voice, in a distant part of the room. Every one looked in the direction from which it proceeded, and discovered in the speaker the squat trader, who was bargaining with the friendly Indians. `What mean you, sirrah?' demanded one of the members, with indignation. `We all know that Sir William loves the ring of gold and silver as well as a Jew,' said the little man with a boldness singularly contrasting with his small voice and diminutive appearance, `and while he can buy beaver-skins for a blue bead each, and sell them to his factors at a dollar, he will not, by going to war with our red friends, put an end to profitable gains.' `By Saint George! there spoke a true word if the devil had given it speech! cried the second speaker with animation. `And herein,' said the first, `lieth, I do verily believe, the secret of the whole matter. The trader hath got the thumb end.' `Shall we suffer this thing to be, gentlemen,' said a bold, slashing cavalier, with a red face, and altogether a dissipated air, who made one of the group; `shall our lives be put in the balance against the governor's cupidity. It is but three hours since the rumor came flying in, that seventeen men have been slain within fifty miles of us, since Saturday night. Sir William must learn that freemen's lives are not to be measured with beaver-tails.' `Tut, tut, Larence, man!' said one of the party, laughing; `you speak treason that will bring you to a hempen neck-cloth' `If it be treason, then have I also a hand in it,' said the young cavalier, who had been listening to their conversation with deep attention. He strode towards the fire-place as he spoke, and the exclamation, `Colonel Bacon!' from every one present, showed that he was no stranger to them, though their manner evinced surprise, both at his presence and language. `Yes, gentlemen,' he continued, after exchanging brief and courteous salulations with them, `if Major Larence had spoken treason, then is every true and honest man in this dominion a traitor! Sir William Berkley looks more to his own interest than to the colony's, and hath some deeper purpose in his forhearance towards the savages who have been so long suffered to lay waste our borders, than appears,—unless this trader hath hit upon the truth.' `This is bold language, Colonel Bacon,' said one of the gentlemen, `to deliver in the hearing of a member of Sir William Berkley's council.' `Sir William Berkley himself, shall hear a plainer speech than even this, Mr. Oglethrope. I have come to Jamestown to-night to ask his Excellency a commission, that I may levy men and go against these Indian robbers.' `This is a bold procedure, sir,' said the old counsellor, with surprise. `The times require bold steps,' was the reply of the young man. `If the Governor refuse to commission you?' asked one of the gentlemen, all of whom had now risen from their seats and were gathered around the young Virginia cavalier, actuated by various feelings, as hostility or friendship to Sir William Berkley influenced their views of this proposed step. `I will in that case, on my own responsibility, raise a party of men who have got too much of the Briton in them to be slaves to any man's will, and go forth against them myself.' `What greater cause have you than other men to take up arms, that you must do this even if you have to do it as a rebel?' asked the counsellor. `Love for my ill governed country, lest it be ruined by the misconduct of those in power. Besides,' he added, in a low, deep tone of vengeance, `did not all you know my cousin and more than brother, Enery Warwick?' `The noblest spirit in the province,' was the unanimous reply. `Well, sir, he died yesterday,' continued Bacon, calmly. `Dead?—how came it?' `By the murderous tomahawk of the savage chief Cineca!' was the low, deep, and almost terrific reply. `This must be looked to,' said the counsellor after a moment's silent surprise. `It shall be looked to, or Sir William Berkley's head shall answer it,' responded Bacon sternly; and strode from the apartment, leaving ing them full of wonder and apprehension of they knew not what impending evil. CHAPTER II. Scene in the Library. Sir William Berkley was seated in his library, the closely drawn window curtains of which could not shut out the vivid lightning of the storm that raged without, while occasional peals of thunder shook his dwelling to its foundation. `Greene Spring,' the seat of Sir William, was a handsome villa, constructed after the old fashioned Virginia style, with a broad hall running through the centre, spacious wings, and a light colonade or gallery, quite encompassing it. A wide lawn, dotted with oaks separated it from James River, near which about a third of a mile from the town it stood.—Here Sir William Berkley lived, in the style of a wealthy country gentleman, as well as Governor, though his hospitality was limited by a certain care for money, characteristic of him, that better became a King's factor, than a King's Governor, or his own high birth. He was a lover of mammon, and made his office rather the instrument for the acquisition of wealth, than for the weal and prosperity of the colony. Aside from this failing, he was a well-bred gentleman, courteous, polite and affable—for these are qualities that cost nothing, and most avaricious men are lavish enough of them so long as their purse strings are not invaded. One great source of his wealth was trading with the Indians, which his station enabled him to do to advantage, and to make a monopoly of the traffic. For two years past, the Indians had been exceedingly troublesome, and were constantly perpetrating atrocious murders along the frontier, on the plea, sufficiently well grounded, that the government was indebted to them for former services in war, in which several of their warriors had been sacrificed, and for which their widows had received no remuneration. Numerous petitions had been made to Sir William Berkley from the planters along the borders, either to satisfy the claim or send troops to protect them. Their applications were disregarded, and the savages became bolder, and at length so dangerous and formidable, that all the inhabitants of the region, open to their inroads, fled from their homes to the towns, leading them with their cattle and harvests, a prey to their enemies. This was the crisis of affairs at the present time. But Governor Berkley was too wise, (to quote the language of the trader,) `to shoot a bullet through a beaver skin,'—and so long as the Indians would send in their furs, he was indifferent how many of his colony were carried off and massacred. There were two persons in the library with Sir William. One of them was a rough, weather-beaten sea captain; who stood twirling his tarpaulin near the table where the Governor sat in ruff, velvet, and powdered wig. The other, who stood opposite the sailor, was an Indian chief of the highest rank, judging from the war-eagle's feather, that graced the coronet of scarlet plumes he wore. `How many skins, Cineca, have you brought down in your canoes, said you?' asked the Governor, who was in the attitude of writing, with a gold pencil in his fingers. `Five canoes—thousand skins in each canoe,' answered the Indian, in good English. `And what am I to give you for them?' `One keg powder, one keg whiskey, twelve guns and one hundred pounds lead, with pipes and tobacco for five warriors.' `This will never do, Chief! 'tis too much, too much, Cineca!' `Brother get the skins very cheap,' answered the Indian. `Too much—too much,' repeated Sir William, `I will give you but ten guns, and fifty pounds of lead, with pipes and tobacco for thyself.' `Cineca must have what he said,' replied the Indian firmly. `You are growing too sharp, Cineca. Two years ago I bought twice as many of you at a fifth of the price.' `Cineca was a child then—he is now a man—brother will pay.' `Well, be it so—but see that you use not these guns against my people,' said Sir William with a smile. `I hear sad accounts from your warriors. Set them to catching beavers, and they will have but little time to molest our borderers. I shall have to send troops against you, and then there will be an end of your thriving beaver trade.' `Warriors love better to hunt men than beaver. If we fight, we no hunt: a scalp is worth a hundred beaver skins,' answered the savage Chief with a kindling eye. `Go to, Chief! Let me hear no more of these murders on the frontier! To-morrow, deliver your skins to my factor and you shall receive your pay. Now Captain,' he said turning to the sailor after the Indian left the apartment, `I must have these skins packed and aboard by Thursday night, which will complete the tale of your rich freight, and you can sail on Friday morning.' `On Friday, Sir William?' `Surely— why do you show such consternation?' `It is an unlucky day, William. I would not put to sea on Friday, if I expected to have luck on the passage.' `You are a fool. Then drive work, and sail Thursday night; they shall not lay a day for man's superstition. The market by last accounts was high, and I would dispatch. If the voyage end prosperously, 'twill make me eight thousand pounds richer than at its beginning.—Well, Edward, what now?' he demanded of a servant who entered. `A gentleman desires to see your Excellency.' `His name? He must have business pressing to venture abroad in in this storm.' `He gave none—but that he was a Virginian.' `This smacks! These haughty Virginians, I verily believe, do look upon themselves as better men than born Britons. Bid him come in. More complaints of the Indians, I'll warrant me. You may go, Captain, and see that the rising sun of Friday shines on your canvas ten leagues a-sea!' The Captain took his leave as the servant ushered in the new visitant. `Ha, Colonel Bacon! you are welcome!—Come upon the old subject, I doubt not,' said the Governor petulantly. `If your Excellency by this phraseology means the subject of our border grievances, permit me to say it is a new subject. Would to God we could say it was an old one! But each day's deeds seem to keep it fresh, and I have hither come from my plantation to see if by your aid this grievance may not be abated, and so made old to those who would hereafter speak of it.' `There is no cause for this array of petitions with which I am hourly beseiged. What bloody deeds the Indians have committed, they have been provoked to by men who would push their possessions into their hunting grounds.' `I am not here, your Excellency, to discuss a question which you have handled in all its bearings. I am here to pray you to give us present aid, that our homes may not be made desolate.' `I have but few household troops, and our militia have little relish for fighting with savages. I question if I could raise five hundred men in all the counties to carry on war with these barbarians.' `I do not ask you to raise a single man, Sir William. If you will commission me to raise what men I may, and leave me to carry on this barbaric war, you shall hear no more of petitions,' said Bacon, with animation. `Commission you, Nathaniel Bacon?' repeated the Governer starting with surprise. `I said so, your Excellency,' said Bacon quietly. `Never, by Heaven! You would soon be general-in-chief, and face God! I should have to look out for my own safety and authority. No, no! I had enough of your fiery ambitions spirit when you were ast year, a member of the Assembly. You were then like to have o'ertopped all other gentlemen! By the round head of Noll Cromwell but this is a singular proposition for you to make to me, sir.' `Will you commission me, Sir William?' asked Bacon, when he had ended, unmoved by his violent language. `Commission you! if you want a commission, go to the devil for it!' The young Virginian struck his sword hilt, as if he would have unsheathed it at this insulting retort, but recollecting himself, said calmly: `Nay, I will not draw my sword save for my country, you have both refused to give me men and to commission me. Now mark, sir! Commission or no commission I do from this hour give myself to this service.' Thus speaking, he left the library, and the house of the Governor and returned to the inn, where ordering his horse, he galloped off, dark and stormy as it was, and departed from the town. CHAPTER III. Scene in the Assembly. Not a week elapsed after the interview between these two gentlemen, ere the rumor reached Jamestown that Colonel Bacon had put himself at the head of one hundred mounted men, mostly of estate, and marched against the Indians, over whom he had gained a most signal victory, The Assembly was in session at the time, with the Governor presiding, and the report was received by this body with incredulity. But a few hours afterwards it was confirmed by a special messenger to the Governor, who was none other than the Cineca himself, who with his life had barely escaped from the slaughter of his warriors. The matter was instantly laid before the Assembly, which was composed nearly equally of those who approved this course of Bacon, and those who sided with the Governer in condemning it. The latter faction, instead of appeasing Sir William's anger, devised means to increase it, by framing specious pretences, which they grounded on the audacity of Bacon's conduct, and the hold he had already got upon the popular affection. Indeed, many of these gentlemen on their own part, began to have Bacon's suddenly displayed merits in distrust, and to look upon him as a rival that would endanger their own personal consideration. Though he was a very young man, they saw plainly that he was master of those talents which win popular favor and confidence, to which he united great wisdom and discretion. `By which embellshments,' says a contemporary, `they thought if hee should bee suffered to continue at the head of a growing army, they, instead of being seniors, might become juniors, while their younger brother, (Col. Bacon,) through the nimbleness of his witt, might steale away that blessing which they accounted their own birthright; and also Sir William thought this rash proceeding of Bacon, if it it did not undoe himselfe by his failing in the enterprize, might chance to undoe him in the affections of the people; which to prevent, he thought it conducible to his intress and establishment, to proclaim him a rebell.” Accordingly, before the Assembly adjourned for that day, Nathaniel Bacon was proclaimed a rebel, and forces were raised to reduce him to his duty. Scarcely had the proclamation been published, ere intelligence reached Jamestown that Bacon's force had increased to seven hundred men, that his army had constituted him General, that a second victory over the Indians had brought them to terms of peace for the time, and thus ended the war. This news was received with demonstrations of joy by the people generally, but filled the Governer and the enemies of Bacon with jealous alarm. Sir William Berkley believed, or affected to believe, that his next step would be to march against himself, and he immediately called upon his `Train Band,' and all true men of the province, to arm in defence of their country against so dangerous an insurgent. Such intentions, however, as the Governor saw fit to attribute to the young leader, had never entered Colonel Bacon's mind. His only object in taking up arms was to free his country from a ruthless foe, which growing confident in the supineness and inaction of the government, threatened to inundate the whole land with blood. `He was a man of quality and merit, brave and eloquent, and became much endeared to the people, not so much for what he had done, as for what they expected he would doe to deserve their devotion,' says an old writer of that day; `while with no common zeale they sent up their reiterated prayers, first to himselfe, and next to Heaven, that he may become their guardian angele to protect them against the Indians, now that the governer cared not whether they were slain or noe.' Thus in a few days had this young man ingratiated himself into the affections of the people, and become indeed, should he see fit to use his power, a formidable rival to the jealous Governor. Bacon having dispersed the Indians, returned to his own country and dismissed his forces, with orders to be ready to obey his call at any moment. He here learned with scornful indignation that the Governor had proclaimed him both a rebel and traitor. The country had recently chosen a burgess for the Assembly, who, from some accidental circumstance, was detained from joining his colleagues up to the time of General Bacon's return; and it was necessary that a substitute should he appointed, and the young insurgent chief was unanimously chosen to fill the station. He gladly accepted the nomination, for he wished once more, now that he had done good service against the common enemy, to see Sir William Berkley, and be commissioned by him, as well as to have the proclamation that had outlawed him, revoked. He therefore, immediately on being elected burgess, embarked in a sloop with thirty of his friends and adherents, and sailed down James river, (on the banks of which, near the head waters, his plantation was situated,) towards the provincial capital. It was night when he arrived and anchored off the town. The Assembly were yet sitting, by the light of their lamps which shone through the windows of the State house, pencilling long lines of light upon the limpid stream. Trusting to the privileges of his official character as an elected burgess, and without reflecting that as an outlaw his election was illegal, the young chief determined to go on shore at once and take his seat in the Assembly. He jumped into a boat, and attended only by Major Larence and another friend, pulled to the land. The night was clear and starry, and the town they were approaching, seemed to sleep, all was so still. Lights burning here and there in a chamber window, and the occasional howl of a dog from the dark mass of houses, alone gave signs that they were near the congregrated abodes of men. As they touched the shore where a few water oaks bent over the stream, they heard the distant sound of the drum and fife, and then followed the varied roll of the tatoo, rising and falling on the wind, telling that them the town was garrisoned and alert. `Berkley has taken care of himself,' said Major Larence, after listening an instant to the martial sounds. `You had best follow his example.' `I fear nothing for myself. Return to the sloop, and let me go alone to the council chamber. Nay, it is best that I should do so. If I bring friends along with me, it will look like suspicion.' After a few words of expostulation on the part of Major Larance, he consented to remain where he was by the boat, that he might be ready to succor his friend if his frank confidence should bring him into peril. When Col. Bacon reached the state house, he was surprised to see a guard of soldiers drawn up around it. Without hesitation he advanced to the entrance of the hall, and demanded admittance into the Assembly. `It were as much as my commission is worth, sir, to admit you,' said the captain, recognizing him in evident alarm, `are you alone?' `Alone!' `Then pass—but I would rather, for your own safety, sir, you should retire,' he said in a low tone. `What have I to fear, captain?' `The Governor's jealousy, and the rival enmity of your colleagues!' `I will meet it. Let me pass in!' The guard stood aside, and the bold young leader opened the door, and strode into the hall of the Assembly. Without stopping, he walked quite up to the forum, just in front of which was the chair for the burgess of his county, and without a word, and in the face of the whole body, quietly took his seat. The surprise his appearance and conduct excited, having a little subsided, the Governer was the first to speak. `How is this, sir traitor! we are bearded in our very Assembly! What doest thou here, arch rebel?' `Represent my constituents,' answered Bacon firmly, and with a smile of proud contempt on his fine dark face. He then rose and laid 4 upon the table his credentials, which the Governor examined with the closest scrutiny. `These are in form, sir, but they do not apply to a traitor. No banned man is eligible to any office of dignity or trust. Gentlemen, this outlaw, Nathaniel Bacon, hath had the audacity to permit himself to be chosen burgess of his county, after proclamation of treason against him, and now demands his seat with as honest a front, as if he were a true man. Will you receive him among your number?' `Ay, ay—no, no!' for several moments filled the hall from conflicting voices, when the Governor, to put an end to it, cried out— `Ho, sergeant! command Captain Wilfred to march in a file of men and take his prisoner.' `Ha, this treachery!' exclaimed Bacon, halt drawing his sword, `Treachery!' repeated Sir William, with a smile of triumph, `Seize the traitor!' he cried, the soldiers entered, and marched up the hall to the spot where he stood. `I will not resist your Excellency,' said Bacon, giving up his sword to the captain of the guard, `lest it should look like guilt. I yield myself your prisoner, and leave the adjudgment of my case to my country.' The Assembly broke up in confusion, and Bacon was led to the prison, where, before midnight, the Governor sent his thirty friends to join him, putting them in irons, having by stratagem captured the sloop as it lay off the town, on learning that it was the vessel that had brought Bacon down the river. CHAPTER VI. The Trial for Treason. The next day Bacon and his adherents were brought ironed into the presence of the Governor and council, who constituted a tribunal for the trial of the offence with which he was charged. The state house was filled with people, and the excitement was so great throughout the town, not only among the citizens, but the members of the assembly and strangers, that the governor was forced to place a strong guard in and about the council chamber. His soldiers, however, had caught the enthusiasm which the young insurgent's brilliant actions had created in the minds of all, and were as likely to go over to Bacon's party, as adhere to the Governor. Sir William Berkley was penetrating enough to see this; and policy dictated to him a mild course, lest by severity he should rouse the indignation of the people and thwart his own ends. After the usual preliminaries in cases of trial for treason were gone through, Colonel Bacon abruptly rose and thus spoke in his defence: `I stand here, gentlemen, manacled like a condemned felon, charged with high treason! I ask whether as a man wholly devoted to his king and country, who has adventured his life and his honor too, to punish enemies in arms against his king and country, be a traitor? I ask if a man who never plotted, contrived, or endeavored the destruction, detriment, or wrong of any of His Majesty's subjects, their lives, fortunes or estates, deserves the name of rebel and traitor? If this be treachery, then am I a traitor! If this be rebellion, then am I rebel! But 'till patriotism be proven to be treason, devotion to the king, disloyalty, and love of country rebellion, I stand before God an honest man and a faithful subject! Behold my conduct in the affair for which I am here in chains. Behold that of my brave soldiers! I call upon the whole country to witness against me or them, if they can! There are some men in authority, who, from weakness of intellect, cannot distinguish between patriotism and rebellion; or, who have such vicious natures themselves, that they can see no good in others! `I have not sought wealth by trickery! I have not sought honor by sycophancy! I have not been blinded by the glitter of gold! I have not been a sponge to suck up the public treasure! The colony has become a mart, and rulers, forgetting their station, have become pedlars and brokers! What arts have been promoted in the colony? what sciences, what schools of learning or manufactories have been established and nourished in authority! Barter and trade, pounds and pennies are the God here worshipped. Such being the universal degeneracy it becomes those men who had remained honest, to look after the country's good. I justify my campaign against the Indians. It is true I have incurred the displeasure of Sir William Berkley, by declaring war against his friends, and, doubtless, beaver-skins will be less abundant in town, for a time. It is well known to all who hear me, that I have done Sir William great wrong, and am viewed in his eyes rather as a robber who hath taken from his purse, than as a traitor, false to his allegiance. But a traitor is easily said—while to prove a man a robber for slaying a few scores of savages, who have long infested the frontier, were a more difficult thing. We all know his Excellency's friendship for his tanny friends, and that to our disgrace and shame, he hath, in this very court, refused to admit a Virginian's oath against an Indian, when that Indian's bare word was accepted against a Virginian. I do but mention these things, my friends, to refresh your memories. I would also hint to Sir William, who listens with commendable patience, that it is not in his power to dispose of his favorite beaver trade to his own profit, it being a monopoly of the crown. But this he must settle with his Majesty. The powder, shot, and fire-arms he hath given to the Indians, contrary to the laws of the colony, hath made him a buyer and seller of the blood of his own brethren and countrymen—this he must settle with his own conscience. But, gentlemen, I have done! I have but reviewed the Governor's course in contrast with my own. You will see who best deserves to be call—' `What?' demanded the Governor, fiercely. `Traitor!' continued Bacon, in a firm tone. `Seize and drag him to execution.' `Sir Governor, you have no power to do this thing,' said Bacon, fearlessly; `I appeal to the King and parliament, where justice and wisdom yet dwell, and where mine and the people's cause will be impartially heard and wisely adjudged.' This speech of the insurgent leader had an electric effect upon the audience of people, and he had no sooner ended, than shouts of applause, mingled with epithets of opprobrium against the Governor, filled the hall, and were re-echoed from the green without. Sir William Berkley was the while burning with indignant mortification, for the words and ironical manner of his prisoner, had cut him sorely. He would at once have him led forth and shot, but that he feared the multitude, whose temper was not to profit, it being a monopoly of the crown. But this he must settle with his Majesty. The powder, shot, and fire arms he hath given to the Indians, contrary to the laws of the colony, hath made him a bnyer and seller of the blood of his own brethren and countrymen—this he must settle with his own conscience. But, gentlemen, I have done! I have but reviewed the governor's course in contrast with my own. You will see who best deserves to be called—' `What?' demanded the Governor, fiercely. `Traitor!' continued Bacon in a firm tone. `Seize and drag him to execution.' `Sir Governor, you have no powerr to do this thing,' said Bacon, fearlessly; `I appeal to the King and parliament, where justice and wisdom yet dwell, and where mine and the people's cause will be impartially heard and wisely adjudged.' This speech of the insurgent leader had an electric effect upon the anduence of people, and he had no sooner ended than shouts of applause, mingled with epithets of opprobrium against the Governor, filled the hall, and were re-echoed from the green without. Sir William Berkley was the while burning with indignant mortification, for the words and ironical manner of his prisoner, had cut him sorely.— He would at once have had him led forth and shot, but that he feared the multitude, whose temper was not to be trifled with. He also feared the result of the appeal to the King, and trembled to have the gangrene of his own character lain open to the assembled parliament by so sharp a knife as the tongue of the young insurgent leader. After consulting a few moments with his counsel on the bench, he turned ty the prisoner, and said in a tone of assumed blandness— `Nathaniel Bacon, I do graciously forgive your harsh language of myself, and by the advice of my counsel, offer you pardon for your offences, on condition of your waiting patiently until I can raise forces for your command. I also acquit from, and pardon all misdemeanors of your friends now at the bar, restoring you, furthermore, and confirming to you your seat in the assembly.' Bacon fixed his penetrating glance upon the Governor while he was speaking, and smiled as if he understood the motive that influenced his conduct, which he was satisfied was fear of losing his popularity with the colonists, and so of being recalled from his polite governorship. `I promise,' answered Bacon, `if the commission you promise be given to me in fourteen days. Your red friends on the borders, Sir William, are by no means wholly quieted, and the men you propose to raise may soon be wanted in the field.' `You shall have the commission, Colonel Bacon, and I trust, hence-forward, all differences between us will end.' Thus spoke the wily Governor, who, by commissioning Bacon under himself, in the regular colonial forces of his own levying, hoped to destroy that extraordinary popularity, which, as an independent leader of a chivalrous volunteer army, he was so rapidly acquiring. By this master-stroke he felt confident he should effectually destroy the rival power that threatened his own ruin. It was done at a great sacrifice of every personal feeling—for the deepest enmity rankled in his breast against him. He then rose, and taking Colonel Bacon by the hand, (after first ordering his manacles to be unlocked,) and placed him in his seat among the members of the assembly. The multitude, blinded by this unexpected termination of the scene, sent up a shout as loud as that which had before burst from them. Sir William Berkley, courteously smiling and this testimony of their approbation, then dismissed the court, and putting his arm in that of Colonel Bacon, left the hall followed by his council and the members of the assembly. CHAPTER V. OCCUPATION OF THE TOWN BY INSURGENTS. The news of the arrest of Bacon and his adherents had flown like wildfire from Jamestown to the interior, and before night, a hundred of his friends, mounted and armed, were in the town, who finding him restored to favor, and his adherents to liberty, returned home satisfied, and with better feelings towards the Governer. Sir William Berkley took advantage of this favorable state of the public mind, and seeing all was once more quiet, issued private warrants to take him again, he having gone to his plantation. At the same time he sent to levy the militia of one of the connties which, situated on the opposite side of the bay, had not inoculated with Bacon's `treason,' and would, doubtless, readily obey his orders, so that, holding the balance of power in his own hands, he might withstand any attempts of Bacon's adherents to rescue him, (should he arrest him,) or avert the course of his vengeance. Bacon, however, was far from being a dupe, to the Governer's duplicity. He anticipated these very steps, and had no sooner reached his own country than he dispatched secret orders to his captains and other officers, to be in readiness for action. At the end of the fourteenth day, he sent a messenger to Jamestown for his commission. Sir William Berkley replied it was ready for him, and the troops already levied, and would be in Jamestown the third day thereafter, to the number of one thousand men. `There shall be a thousand men there before them, you little suspect, Sir William,' said Bacon with a smile, when the messenger returned him this answer, for he had heard of the private warrant, and now determined to act. The same evening he was riding towards Jamestown with nine hundred mounted men at his back. The Governor had rumor of his approach, and in great alarm sent to the well-disposed districts, on both sides of the James river, for forces to defend the town, upon which he was now assured Bacon determined to make an attack. Expresses came hourly of the army's approach, and at two o'clock the ensuing day, the insurgents, (now for the first time, really such,) entered the town without being withstood, and formed a body upon the green. `Not a fflight shot ffrom the end of State House, of horse and ffoot, as regular drawn up in battel array as veteran troopers, and possessing themselves forthwith of all avenues, disarming all the towne, and coming thither both in boats, and by the land.' In half an hour after this, the drum beat for the Assembly to meet, and soon after, the rebel chief came with a file of fusileers, to the outer porch of the council chamber, when the Governor and council went forth to meet him. The scene that followed, is best described in the words of an eye-witness, who was a member of the assembly, and a partizan to the Governor. `We saw from the windowe, the Governor open his breast when he saw Bacon advancing upon him with such hostile bearings. The rebell captain walked between his two files of soldiers, with a fierce aspect and haughtier front, and seemingly in great ire and displeasure at the Governor. We did momently fear he would bid his men fall upon Sir William, and those with him, and we of the assembly expected the same immediate fate. I step'd down to the out-door, and among the crowd, found the seamen of my plantation sloop, who, in great fear, prayed me not to stir from them. I then saw the Governor, who was looking very pale, for he had not two hundred soldiers in the town to stick by him, walk towards his private apartment; a coits' cast distant from the other end of the state house, the gentlemen of the council following him. After him walked Colonel Bacon, commanding his soldiers cock their pieces if any would escape, striking his hand on his sword menacingly. The fusileers with their fusils cocked, presented them at a window of the assembly chamber, filled with faces of the members, and repeated in savage voices. `We will have it! we will have it!' `What will you have?' asked one from the window. `The commission!' answered they. `You shall have it! you shall have it!' repeated the gentlemen, three or four times, shaking his white handherchief out of the windowe. At these words they unbent the locks of their fusils, and stood still until Bacon coming back, (for he had entered the private room with the Governor,) the followed to the main body. `In this hubbub, a servant of mine got so nigh as to hear the Governor's words, when he opened his breast, and also what Mr. Bacon said. Said the Gov'nor— `Here! shoot me! 'fore God, fair mark! shoot!' After rehearsing the same without any other words, whereto Mr. Bacon replied: `No—may it please yo'r excellence—we will not hurt a hair of yo'r head, nor any other gentlemen present. We come for a commission to save our lives and estates from the Indians. This you promised, and have deceived me, and, moreover, have tried to have me arrested, meanwhile, that you might get me into your hands. We want you to fulfil your promise, and we do assure you we will have the commission before we goe,' `And afterwards I heard it was said, Bacon ordered his fusileers, when they were aiming at the windows full of faces, that if he should draw his sword, they were on sight, of it, to fire and slay us, gazing out of the window, saying, `I'll put to death, Gov'nor, council, assemblie and all, but that I'll have the commission!' So near was the massacre of us all that very minit, he had drawn his sword before the pacific handkercher was shaken out of the windowe!' The insurgent leader, on quitting the private apartment of the Governor, where he had left him with his council, entered the assembly alone, leaving his guard at the entrance, and haughtily demanded a commission to be then and there given him. The speaker remained silent, when one of Bacon's friends rose up and said with courtesy: `We would most willingly do this, Colonel Bacon, but you must be aware that to grant it, is not in our province or power, nor in any other, save the King's vicegerent, our Governor.' At length the Govornor and council came in, and promised that if he would withdraw his troops, he should, the next day, receive a commission as general of the forces which he now illegally commanded. To this, after some discussion, he consented, desiring, if possible to avert bloodshed, by bringing his troops in collosion with Governers Gloster's militia, which would arrive the next day—his object being to obtain peaceibly, if he could, forcibly if he must, legal authority to raise men in defence of the frontier. Through all his conduct, he had shown a degree of moderation that proved that he was actuated only by love for his country, and that, so far, he had little deserved the stigma which was attached to his name. CHAPTER VI. CONCLUSION. The next day Bacon, he, having withdrawn his army a league from the town, despatched a messenger to receive the commission of general that had been promised to him. During the absence of this individual, rumor came that the Indians, taking advantage of the intestine civil broils between the Governor's and Bacon's factions, had penetrated within forty miles of the capital, with a large force, burning and slaying wherever they came. He immediately placed his men in order of march, and on horseback, surrounded by his chief officers, waited the return of his messenger. He at length appeared, and said that he was commanded by the Governor to say that the commission could be given only to Colonel Bacon in person, and that if he delayed longer than the third day thereafter, to come and receive it, it would be clearly taken for granted that he did not truly desire it, and only had demanded it to cover his own rebellious designs. This reply fired Bacon with indignation; but he knew too well the character of the Governor to be surprised at it. His first impulse was to march into the town, and chastise the Governor who had sent such a message, and the assembly that had ratified it. But his love for his country over-came his personal feelings, and without hesitation, he gave the command to march forthwith against the Indians. He had been on his march but a few hours, when the Governor's troops, to the number of twelve hundred men, arrived in the town, and encamped on the green so lately occupied by the insurgent forces. He immediately ordered them to be in readiness to pursue Bacon, whom he now a second time proclaimed a rebel, and on pain of forfeiture of estate and imprisonment, aid him in suppressing the rebellion. At this time arose a murmur of dissatisfaction among the troops, already favoring Bacon's proceedings; and answering that they came `to fight Indians, and not Virginians,' they re-embarked in three boats and vessels, and to a man returned across the bay their homes. council of war, fairly tried him, and proved that he had thrice gone between his enemy and Jamestown, on private service for the Governor. The proof was clear; yet Bacon, unwilling to shed the first blood in the quarrel, declared openly to him, in the hearing of the whole line, `that if one man in the army would speak a word to save him, he should not suffer death.' No one interceded for him, and he was shot. This clemency of the insurgent leader greatly increased his popularity, and added numbers, hitherto neutral, to the force he commanded. Sir William Berkley, on hearing of Bacon's approach, tried to gather a force to withstand him. But the popularity of the opposite cause was greater than that of the loyal party, and he could not muster more than three hundred men to stand by him in the defence—a third of whom were members of the Assembly, and private gentlemen personally disaffected towards Bacon. With these, however, the Governor determined to make resistance, and threw up a breast-work across the narrow peninsula, which joined the town to the main land. This he protected by four pieces of cannon planted a hundred rods in the rear; and taking up his position with more resolution and courage than it was supposed his bartering and avaricious spirit had left in him, he waited the advance of the insurgents. The same afternoon, Bacon arrived in sight of the works, and taking a close view of them, did not see fit to attack the position, but went to work and threw up an embankment beyond musket shot and twice the height of the barrier, so that in the morning the Governor found that his position was commanded by that of his enemy. He elevated his cannon, and was about to open a fire upon his work, when to his surprise, he saw several ladies appear upon the rebel's ramparts, whose husbands were with him in his own party. This produced surprise and consternation on his side, and the firing was instantly withheld. As they stood uncertain how to act, they found their own defences suddenly and in d moment carried, while they, for fear of slaying the ladies on the ramparts, were unable to return a single shot. This singular step on the part of the insurgent leader was taken doubtless to prevent unnecessary blood-shed, in which he was partially successful. The Governor finding his works carried and the enemy in the town, resisted them a few minutes, and then, with the loss of several men, precipitately fled to his vessels, and crossing the bay left the town in the hands of the rebels. The quarrel had now taken the aspect of a civil war, and Bacon felt that he had gone too far to retract. He now resolved to take the government into his own hands, send out a true representation of the whole affair to His Majesty, and throw himself upon the king's clemency. He was herein a rebel, but not a traitor. To any other man than Sir William Berkley, appointed by the king, he was ready to resign his authority and yield up his power. To him he determined never again to pay allegiance. Up to this period, the impartial historian will perhaps justify the conduct of Nathaneil Bacon. He was now, however, under the excitement of conquests, about to commit an act, but for which his name might have come down to us as that of a patriot leader of the loftiest virtue and courage. It is difficult to tell why Colonel Bacon should have burned Jamestown. That he thought its destruction necessary to his safety, is probable. But whatever may have been his motive for this flagrant act, it stands recorded against him as a crime of the deepest dye, and is the main point on which hangs his reputation as a lawless rebel. Before night, the whole fair `towne' was in a heap of ashes—church and state house, hotel and private dwelling—not a roof remained to tell where in the morning stood the capital! The next day he marched out of the town, and prepared to take up a strong position not far above on James River, having some unknown design in contemplation, when he was suddenly seized with illness while on horseback, and died three days afterwards—it is said from the effects of poison rubbed upon his saddle by the Indian Cineca. This event at once put an end to the rebellion, which bid fair, measured by the awakening ambition of its head, to separate Virginia from Great Britain. Those gentlemen who could save themselves by flight instantly did so. Many of the insurgent officers, among whom was Major Larence, were taken and executed, and numerous estates were confiscated. It was a season of triumph as well as profit to Sir William Berkley, who soon made himself opulent on the rebel's spoils. He soon after went to England, it was rumored by command of the king, leaving Colonel Jeffries in his place as governor of the province. It is well known that Charles, hearing of his arrival in London, said of him, with the characteristic freedom with which he was wont te speak of his public officers: `That old fool has hanged more men in that naked country than I have done for the murder of my father!' The Governor, hearing of this, became so mortified with grief and vexation, that he died soon after, without seeing His Majesty, his vast property escheating to the crown. Thus terminated the famous `Bacon's rebelion, and the lives of the principal actors therein.' If the private documents from which the facts in this brief outline are taken, speak the truth, the name of Colonel Bacon will be rescued from the infamy which has adhered to it, for a century and a half: the stigma of corruption, cruelty and treachery, will be fixed on the administration by which he was condemned; and one more case will be added to those which prove that insurrections proceed oftener from the misconduct of those in power, than from the factious and turbulent temper of the people.
