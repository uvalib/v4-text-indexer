      <field name="fulltext">THE BUCCANEERS. BOOK THE THIRD. THE TIMES OF JACOB LEISLER.[1] [1] Historical Illustration.—It here of a certainty becometh me to mention that which I have heretofore delayed until the learned reader had arrived at this part of the veracious narrative, whereto these observations adjoin, and of a truth, rightly belong, seeing my remarks are here most applicable; (howbeit it might derogate from my research, that I mentioned not the facts heretofore) that the historie detailed in the text wandereth, adverse to the authorities of the time, into divers anachronisms, whereof the existence of the characters and events relating to the pirate Kid, and Jacob Leisler, form a very grievous portion. Certes, the period of the rover's exploits, and the insurrection of the Hollander, were divided by a lapse of several years; seeing that the maritime depredations of the first, were not perpetrated until the times of Governor Benjamin Fletcher, and the Earl of Bellamont, who were the successors of Colonel Sloughter, who is introduced in the historie; nathless, there was no lack of pirates at the period whereon the text dwelleth in relation; and it was for the suppression of these, that Kid was despatched as the narrative tells even in the outset; albeit, a strict adherence to circumstances as they actually chanced, is commendable; nathless, the narrative hath many ensamples of deviation from the correct rule; both among the ancients and moderns, which are needless to enumerate, seeing no blame can attach itself to the error of chronology. whereon I have indited this dissertation, after recalling to the memory the liberties taken with time by the immortal and divine Maro, in placing Dido in Africa at the time of æneas, while in reality, it was full three hundred years subsequent to the taking of Troy, that the sister of Pygmalion founded Carthage.—T. P. SECTION I. Mar. Thus far we have sailed and ran no risk, Our gallant bark riding the broad billows As proudly as e'er an eagle ploughed The mountain air; but now we change our course; Ho, mates, take in the main sheet—set the braces— The wind doth come in a fresh point; large clouds Gather in the heaven; we must be alert. Now mark my words—there will be weather That will rattle our rigging ere night. The Mariner's Tale. That the reader may draw breath as well as myself, at every convenient stoppage of the narrative, I have proposed, nay, determined on an experiment; to which I now proceed; and deeming it the duty of a writer, that what he does in his discourses with the world, he must do boldly, as the soldier who volunteers the forlorn hope; for he cannot, if he be no servile flatterer, expect to meet all favour—he must offend the taste of some, to please others —nay, to gratify his own;—at a period of the romance like that to which it is now brought, I have concluded without offence, I hope, et sans ceremonie, to any person concerned, to take leave of the rule, which in the latter sections of the second book in this work, I had bound myself to observe—and, leaving the characters I have heretofore summoned to fill my scenes, to take care of themselves, for awhile I shall enter on a new ground, which, however, may in the denouement, be found to forward the progress of the main business; but in the pursuit of this object, I feel I shall often need to be called to order—for a habit, which has, I have no doubt, been a great drawback on my readers already, still sticks to me; and is so miserably interwoven in my nature, that I fear it will bear me out in the very last page; it is, that reflect I must—and what is worse, I must trouble my readers with my thoughts and dissertations; and as I am now approaching a portion of the work, to which all the former parts may appear merely subservient, I cannot refrain (from the nature of the events 1* which I shall be forced to detail) from frequently remarking on men and manners as they exist, when compared to them as they have once existed. There were indeed bad men, bad deeds, and a bad world, in the olden day, but then were the ages of barbarism and idolatry; but for all the storied chronicles relate—for all the pen of the historian hath traced—for all the scorn that is heaped on our unlettered and unpolished forbears, I am brought to believe, and that on no weak foundation, that the most foul crime they knew, hath its superior, and where they had the ability to commit one vile action, among us a thousand are hourly perpetrated, far beyond what the most abandoned could have once dreamed of; and though this be termed the age of wisdom, of morality and religion; yet the most glaring vices, and most atrocious criminals, stalk abroad in open day, with upright front; and it is virtue alone, that like some trembling and timid bird shunning the fowler's eye, seeketh darkness, and fearfully cowers in the shade; indeed honesty is the marah, the bitter waters of the Scripture; few love to taste it. Although perhaps the wickedness of these times may have been exceeded in the capability of its enactors; at least, at no period hath it ever been more impudent and barefaced, seeming as if that, which with our forefathers was but in the bud, hath now blown out to its fulness: in truth, decency of behaviour is scarcely observed in any station of life or state of society; at present, the higher are only distinguished from the lower classes, by their ingenuity in roguery, and their refinement in debauchery: for while the ragged losel robs for a few coppers to supply his drunkenness, the proud gentleman as he terms himself, filches from his friend, his brother, his patron, thousands which he riots away on bawds, dice and wassail; and yet there never was more religion than now; but then, never was there less morality. What a convenient garb for villany, for hypocrisy, hath ever been the scapulary—the black badge of priesthood; what numbers of our divines are avaricious, canting deceivers—who, dead to true piety, own no spring except the strong urgings of private interest; who have no charity for man, no heart but for themselves— no God but gold—and who preach, but practise not: in numerous instances, religion hath been made an article of traffic, and bought and sold as though it was a mere carnal thing—a piece of merchandise formed for the uses of man; and so it has been—for the simple religion of nature, when the worshipper without the pomp of carved altars and pillared chapels—without the rich bound, gilded prayer book, and the soft and crimson cushion, poured forth in simple guise, his heart unto his maker, hath passed—and devotion hath become the enaction of foppery, of sleek locked bigots—of starched and sanctified apes, who assume a meekness of heart, which is but outward show, the covering of depravity; who talk of lowliness, while they flutter like butterflies, proud of their silken cloaks and snow white bands: yes, the preacher even at the desk, seeketh not the meekness that should become his station—but with the heart of the tiger, thirsting for blood, points out the way to persecution: at times, yea, in the self same breath, he talks of charity, and of death and torments to those who differ in their creed from that to which he is bound, by bonds of iron, of ignorance, of bigotry, of livelihood; for often his bread depends upon spreading doctrines which he scorns and laughs at, over his secret convivial cups—and which he brings his false lips to utter, to gratify the infant minds of doting old women, and simple girls; for such are the true supporters of the clergy. Out on the garments of disguise! I have known one of them, who, from the cold, stony, and frosted threshold of his doorway, hath thrust forth even to the storm, the scarce garbed and shivering beggar, bidding him, unpitied, seek relief in the bleak winds of winter; yet he, a pampered pauper, revelled in luxury: I have heard his voice denounce as vile, amusements, which he himself slily enjoyed;—away with such deception! Sad indeed is it, that the gown should be changed to the leper's mantle, a cloak to cover and hide vile spots, loathsome deformities, and deadly passions—the fierce, revengeful hatred, and the baser frailties of weak hu manity, and serve alike for the garb of hypocrisy and the blackest designs. Here, however, let it be borne in mind, that no one more venerates and respects, than the inditer of these sentiments, true and unfeigned piety, gentleness and devotion: but where are they to be found? for it is too palpable to every observer, that there are more unblushing pretenders among the votaries of religion, than any other following; and I must confess, I cannot endure to behold with patience or temper, so many puritanical mountebanks impose on the unwary multitude: wretches whom Cibber describes as making a trade of religion, and showing an uncommon concern for the next world, only to raise their fortunes with greater security in this.[2] [2] The Nonjuror. Yes, from the very bottom of my heart, I do detest this over pious species, who, losel-like, fatten on the richest benefices, swelled by the alms of the blinded, the besotted and the childish; who riot in the plentiful contributions of the ignorant, who are gulled out of their time and money on false pretences, the conversion of the Hottentot or the Samoide, and who after performing a thousand nefarious deeds unpunished, hold up their hands, and groan in the very spiritual nasal twang of the conventicle at the every action of another. Again, of what consists the crowd of our civilians, but of abandoned sharpers and needy knaves, who prowl abroad like the insatiable hyena, seeking whom they may devour, defiling the purity of justice with their unhallowed doings; they are like that treacherous animal, who, discontented with its due share of food, seeks for an unguarded moment of its master's meal with eager lip and flashing eye, to pounce upon the dish and glut its ravenous appetite with all that it can prey on, watching even for the life's blood of him who had been its fondest protector;† † Vide, An account of the death of M. Mariette, by a favourite cat.—English Paper. the most vile and really weak chicanery are allowed to overcome right, and men are oftener robbed of life or fortune by the incorrectness of a word than by truth and justice; and it is this that makes the law the villain's refuge and the honest man's bane; for judges pride themselves more on giving ear to the letter of the law, the meaning of a word, a technical form, or rather, as it is called, legal knowledge, which closes the hearing though it may sharpen the sight, than the voice of evidence, and the facts in dispute; and it is seldom but the most perfidious and villanous of mankind, on the most frivolous subtities and the flimsiest subterfuges, escape even though clearly detected, their deserved punishment. Such is the law; a base and wilful false swearing, though it may be the ground of misery, of ruin, and of misfortune, is not a punishable perjury if it be not material to some frivolous point on trial. Out on these childish forms, the legal trickeries that do, by shielding the wicked and the profligate, destroy honor, honesty and truth! And farther, if a man be a politician, a follower of the ruling party of the day, in this part of the world, he is amenable to no offence; it is true, if his conduct be too flagrant to be glossed over, or to smother from public indignation, the mockery of an investigation is gone through; but it is a flimsy fiction to cheat the multitude, and, by bringing forth the offender pure and unspotted, give him new opportunities to pursue his atrocities with impunity. I have beheld one man ascend the judgment seat (but him we all know[3] [3] I have remarked divers metaphors of knowledge, or rather, licenses of the kind whereon I now write, in the text in the course of the historie; albeit I have not been enabled to meet success in my investigations thereon; natheless, I have an idea, from the period of the narrative, and divers similitudes, that this instance meaneth the famous Jeffries, a judge in the time of James the Second, howbeit it may have reference unto Dirk Van Rikettie, or some one who beareth an extreme likeness unto him in the text.—T. P. ) to set on trial of a felon, so afterwards convicted, accused of wilful perjury, whose hand, as though a dear friend, he had clasped a moment before the opening of the court, though, let it be remembered, an indictment had long been found, and, as may be supposed from this, care was taken that sentence never should be passed upon the culprit; for why? he was influential at the poles, at an election. Aye, this very judge, I have been told, and have cause to believe it, with the same breath hath encouraged the rogue, and the honest man hath he denounced; the popular cry with him is the law, he would kiss the feet of a leper, drink the gutters dry, steal, murder, for men in power; indeed he is a fair allegory of the fabled figure that crowns the building wherein he has a seat being blind of one eye; but his blind side hath a certain cure the instant he feels it the strongest. But this man has some virtues that are not to be denied; he can with such good nature, apparent rectitude, and unblushing confidence decide a cause, or rather a point of law, at one hour in one manner, and a different time in another; and has so many authorities, unknown to any other jurist, at command, that it confirms the idea, there is more talent required to be an honest man than a knave; in a word, through the artifices of rogues like this man, who seek for protection or service from their power, the law hath become so overburthened with rotten statutes, that it hath grown rather an oppression than a safeguard to those who honestly have recourse to it, and who really may be termed with some propriety, in the words of a writer whose name has escaped me, “patients, rather than clients.” Indeed the law is like some huge umbrageous tree, rooted in discord, loaded and almost weighed down by innumerable dead and dying branches and withering foliage, and which cannot again flourish until fairly trimmed by the skilful knife of the woodman; but which, left longer unimproved, will become unfit for aught but the forest axe to level, and to he hewed from the roots for the fire; or perhaps the law may be better likened to some old, scarce inhabited tower, the home of the bat, the night owl and the rook; a tall pile whose roof is matted o'er with withering flowers, and whose blackened visage proclaims the lapse of years, the wrecks of man, the changes dire which time effects and his dark servant death—the extent of whose ruined apartments is scarce known to its possessors, who still, with mad fondness, dwell on amid the dust and the lumber of ages; amid the gloom of its wide halls, which scarce feel like the dwelling of man, but rather his sepulchre; disdaining the social and convenient comforts of a neat modern mansion for an ancient rookery, which hath nothing to recommend it except veneration for the moss and ivy, which like some creeping thing of life, hath glided up the crumbling wall, and, with its green and smiling visage carpeting the cold brown stone, o'er which a hundred winters had spent their fury, seeming like some tender and youthful child embracing its aged ancestor, and bespeaking its antiquity. And to pursue the inquiry of this subject, the state of the times, let me ask what now is the man of medicine, but a conceited empirick, a mere fop of pill and glister, a self-be-puffed pedant, swelling and bristling with ignorance and his own lofty pretensions to importance? though as to knowledge, more exact in the set and knot of a neckcloth than in the beat of a fevered pulse, or the means to allay a throbbing temple—there is one of this species, the very buffalo of his breed, a huge, strapping creature, as empty as a hogshead of all except arrogance and presumption, by whose unmerited success, the minor followers of the lancet trim their course and fashion their manners; troth, he is a very mother All-flesh, in bulk and intellect; heavy, vastly heavy, alike in wit and countenance; he hath the amplitude and features of a bull, fattened by high feeding, and looketh the square compound of every sense, except that which is the most wanted; he is the very humbug and jest of notoriety, pleased with the rattle of a child and the dividing of a straw, his whole study is to thrust himself into celebrity, in the very face of public opinion; and to build his own fame he taketh every mean method; the suppression of the honours, and the name of another is of little consequence if it interferes with his plans; a servile press his organ, he crams his absurdities upon the world, which, surprised at his impudence, scarce knows whether to resent it or despise the vain ape—who makes his admirers, not by his talents, but his feasts; for indeed in what doth this creature excel? with a lamb's heart and a sheep's head, he is superior in but one quality, selfishness—an utter disregard to every principle except his own views; and that the ideas of a physician on this are equal to any other intriguer's is not to be doubted, when we remember how the public purse hath been fleeced by these preservers of health, when we recall the successive experiment of that famous botanist and lucky alchymist, who turned a garden of rotten herbs and stinking weeds to gold, by means alone of a broad face of brass.[4] [4] This is obtuse, and I am not able to give an assured or accurate illustration, howbeit, I have made divers researches among the doings of ancient chemists and philosophers, and peradventure I have perused numerous learned works, that treateth of transmutation of metals and other inanimates, nathless, without success, therefore, I have concluded, that this referreth unto a mere botanical experiment,—T. P. And to proceed, what in reality are all these scientific, historical, graphical, philosophical, and charitable societies, but so many respectable names for associations of gourmands and topers? What single assistance hath been derived by the student from their frequent revels, save there be science, virtue, or learning in dissipated habits, and the practice of horrid acts of debauch; the foundation of such institutions, says Addison, are on eating and drinking: the vulgar and the ignorant are modest, they gulp their drams in secret and alone, but it is the pride of learned men to guzzle in crowds, and show their gluttony to the world, to fill the journals of the day with their pleasantries in their cups, in the shape of hackneyed sentiments, whose dullness not even wine can enliven, and which, in numbers, are an army of compliments, that drunken rivals belard each other with, so that the hardest skull would be fairly cracked, e'er one could get half through with a glass to each; indeed, it is now considered as an extraordinary annunciation to state, that at such festals `all things went off with proper and becoming decorum,' which, in plainer language, signifies that no thick headed professor† † Without dubitation, this is an irreverend and wicked scandal against learned and erudite men, and hath assuredly offended my sight in the text, nathless, the inditer would not consent to an erasure thereof, and therefore I was fain to assent (albeit, it is needless to repeat reluctantly,) to its remaining, even as it was originally written, taking an argument of solace unto myself that no share of the offence was mine, howbeit, the world knoweth the untruths wherewith we, who are of a studious and searching nature, are assailed by the vulgar—nathless, I will remark unto my ingenious associates my reasons for permitting this vituperation against them, peradventure the inditer being strenuous in his determination, I feared that in some portions of the narrative, whereon I had set my heart, seeing there is somewhat on lewd fashions, play-house mummery, and charlatanism, which might apply unto the follies of the present period, whereof I doubted he might have taken an ill-will, and have thwarted my wishes for its continuance in the text, therefore I submitted unto his requisition, believing as teacheth that brilliant luminary, Sir Thomas More, “some sick men will take no medicine unless some pleasant thing be put amongst their potions, although, perhaps it be somewhat hurtful; yet the physician suffereth them to have it. So because many will not hearken to serious and grave documents, except they be mingled with some fable or jest, therefore reason telleth us to do the like.” —T. P. got so beastly drunk that he was obliged to be carted home at midnight; or that no tunbellied alderman (which sort of cotton bales are always ex-officio honorary members of philosophical associations, probably owing such dignified preferments to the profound knowledge which these venerable worthies ever discover at carving the best portion of a public contract for themselves, as well as the breast or wing of a goose; or otherwise the honour may be a matter of course, granted out of respect to the nautical skill shown by the `grave signors,' in steering clear of fines and sequestrations, when they break the laws they help to enact) gave in of a surfeit at the fourth course, in evident fear of bursting, though doubtless, there is more heading than hooping wanted among such rioters; still they are fully on an equality with those companies who are ostensibly congregated for benevolent purposes; for from them (natheless their apparent object,) what hath the sick or poor benefitted? there are as many destitute, sinking unrelieved in want and disease as before such societies existed; the tavern and the wine cellar hath truly gained by them, but it is a question if ever the lazar hath been bettered a meal from their banquets, the exercises of which are pretty much the same with those celebrated by order of the Macedonian conqueror at the funeral pyre of Calanus, a combat of hard drinkers, of whom it is related, nearly forty died on the Vol. II. 2 spot, from the power of the grape, and he who triumphed did scarce survive his hard got victory the brief space of thirty-six hours.[5] [5] Quæ gloria est capere multum? Cum penes te palma fuerit, et propinationes tuas strati somno ac vomitantes recusaverint, cum superstes toto convivio fueris, cum omnes viceris virtute magnifica et nemo tam capax vini fuerit, vinceris a dolio.—Senec. Epist. lib. XII. Such being the performances of those who call themselves the learned and respectable, what can be expected from the herd who must follow in their wake, but that they are equally contaminated, and alike dissolute. There is not a single occurrence that is not tainted with vileness and abandoned knavery; your very neighbour, nay, your dearest friend chuckles delighted, if for the value of a farthing he can cheat you; and thinks it a rare jest to tell his cunning to your face, and laugh at your credulity. All is overreaching duplicity, and the more apparent the sharper, the more barefaced the rogue; the more the man is lauded: and he who fairly hath in justice won the halter, and from which it would be hard to rescue him in any other country, is the one who is most trusted, finds the most defenders, and indeed, in the world's opinion, stands the clearest. His rogueries are quoted by the admiring crowd as specimens of talent, his hair-breadth escapes from the clutches of the law are but passports of respectability. But it must be remembered these remarks are qualified; for the knave must be a rich one; that as well as he hath preserved his neck, he hath kept his plunder; for `an he be a poor rogue' the Lord help him, he will find himself as bad off as an honest man. But that the city of our residence is crowded with characters as described, may in one wise be accounted for, since it is the great mart of adventure, where all the itinerant vagabonds of the continent gather en masse, for the sake of pushing their fortunes, or, rather, of preying on those of better folks. To one point they flock like a flight of carrion crows about a corpse, determined to devour; without a solitary dollar, they look for maintenance in the pockets of others; upon nothing, except an eager wit, barefaced assurance, and hungry stomachs, they set out, and with full purses, swaggering consequence and arrogant pride, as might be expected from their means, do they end their journies of adventure. Here comes a troop of half-starved, beggarly, breechless, ragged, lean, long-necked Yankee lawyers, schoolmasters, pedlars, and what not, who in all probability have to a man been drummed out, or whipped through every town of their own states, ready to cheat, rob, lie, or talk for any body that will employ them. Firm in bad principles, and determined to push onwards, is it to be wondered that the lawyer, who had at home tended pigs, fed poultry, sowed pumpkins, and skinned onions, in a little while is elevated—not to the gallows, oh, no! but to the bench of the judge, or a seat in the hall of congress, —for where could the populace find a more convenient representative, or one more willing to slave for his constituents, so as he makes his own fortune. The schoolmaster, who used to sit, and deem it an honour too, in a corner of the deacon's kitchen, where he was on board, and sleep in the garret, among rats, old boots, broken spinning-wheels, dust, draperies of dried peppers, peaches, and molasses jars, is metamorphosed into an impudent office-hunter, boastful of his services and his pretensions, or a corrupt scribbler, with a pen for all occasions, and for every party that may believe him worth the purchasing. And lastly, the pedlar, whose whole employment had been to take in the `fellers and gals' with trumpery baubles, whose best meals were the charity of the farmers where he stopped, Indian pudding baked beans, `sarse, and innards,' whose happiness had been to rest in a barn upon straw, or among the corn-stalks, and whose highest ideas had been to mount the horse which he stole from his customers, or to sit on the ducking stool; this creature is changed in a short period, by the prosperous trade of deception and knavery he has pursued, to the lofty nosed merchant, who would fain carry his head as high as the mast of one of his own ships; the cock-sparrow of the exchange, whose capital is the credit he can obtain from all the fools who are eager to trust him; and there are no lack of these, for heaven knows there are five times as many who would put confidence in, and lend money to a knave, a sheet rascal, than a poor honest man; for in truth, it is no wonder, it is more satisfactory; for at once you are acquainted with what you are to expect, for the latter can and will only pay you as he is able, which is oftentimes giving a long time, while the former, like an upright fellow, puts you straightway out of all misery, by telling you `you are an impolite dog to ask any thing of a man of honour, who condescended to receive your paltry goods, and since you are so importunate, he'll be damn'd if he ever pays you at all; you may sue an you like—who cares a jot? no one need trouble himself while there is a Recorder and an Insolvent Act in New-York.' Thus do these men vaunt, and while they push themselves into consequence, gentility, and even power, the good citizen, the gentleman, who seeks for happiness in retirement, or as virtue is always backward, is too modest to thrust himself, whatever may be his just claims, on public favour, remains neglected, his very existence unknown, without influence or name; while yet these creatures, usurping his place in the community, the scum of dirt and impurity, the origin of the kennel, still unwashed and rank with filth, all flimsiness and vapour, obtrude themselves with giant airs in every public business of importance: is a committee formed to encourage some noble national object, are the names you read of such committee, men of worth or respectability? No. they are these self-imposed, self-nominated chaps, who take care by a ready out-a-door cut and dried plan, to figure in the public prints, in places where worth, honesty, integrity, respectability and learning are wanted, and ought to have been. If a station, no matter what, be vacant, though it be one that demands men of the choicest to uphold, it is sure to be first sought after by these blood suckers: indeed, so unparalleled is their audacity, that the good have become inert and indifferent; and these have been besotted with success, and really begin to believe themselves the mighty personages they would be, and of that moment, that the world without their aid, would come to a dead stop; and they break out on the astonished natives, with all the airs of a jay, when disguised in the peacock's plumage. Away with such upstarts! these great little men—these time serving, dirt born objects of self-conceited mightiness—these insignificant, detestable parasites—faithless to every virtue, and undeserving of the name of man. The influence arising from the laxity of morals, that has been treated on, is most severely felt in the decay it brings to the very heart of the social virtues; there, indeed, it strikes home, and no barrier can be raised against the attack: as the customs of the day become contaminated, all must alike be injured; and even women, lovely women, whose primeval brightness is as beautiful as the sunny blossoms of the laburnum wound in a chaplet for the brows of Spring, is touched with the fatal spirit, and is fast casting away all that adorned her, as she would a yoke of slavery; for that which delights her ear, and is termed by its professors a strain of innocent gallantry, is but a scarce veiled tirade of shameless licentiousness: and it appears as if all a female now aims at is to be noticed by the crowd, either for the richness or the singularity of her dress; it is not a difficult thing to be singular, says the Abbe Le Blanc, persons need only push their character, whatever it be, to excess, and have no regard to decency—and on this principle, do the ladies of the day act; to spend hour after hour at the toilette—to dress so as to be mistaken for the painted bawds of the brothel—to parade the streets with no earthly object, but to gratify their vanity and be seen— to discourse or laugh so loud, as to attract all eyes—to toss their heads affectedly—to utter affected phrases and conceited words—to read novels filled with lack-a-daisical sentimentalities; these, and no more are needed, to make an accomplished belle; and these are the pleasant amusements of the most fashionable—who plume themselves on being the mirrors of elegance and manners. However, that a want of delicacy should be theirs, is not surprising, when we behold among their evening resorts, the playhouse takes a conspicuous station—for what but ill can arise from frequenting the very hot bed of vice— the building within whose walls debaucbery is licensed, and immorality is countenanced? the theatre hath had 2* its enemies, and its hired defenders; the good and ill effects of the drama, hath been often pointed out, oftentimes cried out unto the heedless world, who care not, in the search for enjoyment, whether the grasp is good or evil: suffice it to say, on the one point, no man of reason can be an enemy to the drama—I mean the written works of genius—the perusal—the honest enaction of some of which, if it were withheld from the world, would be a loss to virtue, of lessons more powerful, more impressive, than a thousand homilies from the lips of paid preachers; but it is the mimics, the charlatans, the performers, and the fashion of the enaction, that every moral man should condemn; in these consist the danger, and the causes for which the theatre should be shunned, even as a pest-house, where disease and death is to be received. What is the life of an actor? drunkenness, debauchery, harlotry and dissipation of every kind. Who are these men? vagabond strollers at first, characters of the most desperate description, who have had but one choice, the highway or the stage. Enter into the walls, and behold the passing scene:—can any female who hath the least feeling or modesty, nay, can a man, who is not lost to every sense of right and shame, look on without his very soul being harrowed up in disgust and indignation. Behold yon losel, his eye yet glaring with the late wassail, while the paint, necessary to the character he has assumed, can scarce disguise the parched and sallow cheek his long life of dissipation hath left him: still, though before an audience, doth he believe himself in the brothel, and the chaste diction of the poet doth deform with interpolations and actions which, though it may please the swine who herd in the pit and gallery, sickens the sight, and is not fit for man or woman, who are not outcasts, to hear or look upon. And then, is there a drinking house about the purlieus of the town where there is more riotous revelry, or more encouragement, open and unbridled by law, for youth to be led astray. A portion of the building is set aside for the sale of every liquor, and for the exhibition of ladies of easy virtue, and these are in the very glance of the fair and virtuous dames who frequent the house, and who, be as fastidious as they may, cannot turn their eyes, lest they should be blasted with lewd and lascivious actions that would cause the blood to rush warm to their brows, while their cheeks glow with crimson, like the sun-touched nectarine. On one ground, the defenders of the stage have plumed themselves, that there have been females who have followed it as a profession, who have been virtuous;—this may be, but the examples are so rare they can scarce be designated, and the very boast of it discovers how few there are, and the poorness of this defence. This opinion on this matter is not the formation of an hour; I have had the opportunity, and my remarks have facts, `stubborn facts,' to found their sentiments upon; the very nature of an actress' life is such that she must be a woman of little honour:—for what modest female would expose herself before the sight, the rude and daring eyes of thousands, and bear the remarks, and the examination, of the sensualist and the debauchee; for their amusement assume dresses, habits unbecoming her sex, and even common modesty. The courtezan will not expose herself in the light, but here, women pretending virtue deck themselves in worse attire than the livery of harlots and prostitutes; then, the scenes that are gone through with, should be as abhorrent to a female as to a male:—the liberties allowed and taken in the view of hundreds, such as none who felt for herself would admit for mines of wealth; then, the allowances presumed to follow naturally from the public conduct, in secret must be such, are such as to leave but little doubt that it is impossible for a woman who has respect for herself to be an actress, or to follow the stage for a livelihood; and these ideas are confirmed by every printed life of women of this class to be found. Ought, then, such a place to be encouraged as a resort? The brothel of infamy should be preferred to the stage, which is alone prostituted to show off bawds, drunkards, and gambling sharpers. And do not those who encourage impurity by resorting to the home of charlatry, soon feel the ill effects:—it is the rock whereon youth is wrecked oftener than any other that can be shown; it leads to drunkenness, gaming, and every other wickedness. There have been formed societies to suppress vice; they will persecute the poor wretch who steals for his bread, and yet the very root of crime is maintained, the abode of sharpers, dissipation and ruin; for there is an enchantment about the theatre—beauty that is to be bought, and riot that can be pursued; the apprentice will rob his master, the child his parent; the husband hath taken the labour of the day to gain him admission, while at home his family are wanting food; a few years beholds the first an inmate of a prison; the second a poor lost wretch, discarded from his home, and begging for money to obtain liquor, that all reflection may be drowned in its overwhelming influence; the last the pander of some brothel, while the sod covers the broken heart of his wife, and his innocent and unfortunate offspring are scattered on the bosom of the cold and pitiless world. Nor in addition to the theatre, is there much obtained by the visiting of public places, and festal routs and dances, in the manner which they are now conducted; where lascivious coquetry, is termed an innocent flirtation—where to be in perfect mode and full dress, for a female, is to be attired in unblushing indecency, that attracts the wanton gaze of the multitude—where every thing between the sexes appears an easy familiarity—where practice supercedes persuasion, and prudence gives way to a wish to be admired—where, rather than not be noticed, an indelicate display of figure, and a flagrant violation of decorum, may be resorted to, without attracting an indignation on the audacious exhibition, but rather a flood of praise, at either the grace, ease or agility, with which the being who degrades herself for such celebrity, performs her part, the only merit of which is, the gross exposure of her person, at which modesty shudders, and the feelings revolt in shame and sorrow, but which is alone felt by the timid spectator: but it is needless—it is a mere waste of labour, to speak on subjects which there is neither care nor inclination to reform, and which, though vices, are admired, are patronised, and reckoned virtues; which it is the fortune of their possessors to practise, and which, ere the mind, so besotted is it, can be weaned from, and modesty come in fashion, an entire new race must arise, with different examples, and different principles, as their standards of action. Such are the effects of modern fashions, and improved and polished customs—far otherwise were those of the days which are treated of in the pages of this narrative; however wickedness lurked concealed in the heart, it dared not boldly rush on the gaze; and although it must be confessed, the practices of villany were not uncommon, yet honest virtue was admired, and sometimes showed its face, a thing now rare and unremembered. It was early on the evening of the day which the traveller parted from his companions and preservers, that a throng of persons were assembled in the principal apartment of the governor's house, which was situated in the interior of Fort Willem Hendrick, or as it was then most properly called, Fort Orange, or Aurania, the principal defence of the city of New-Yorke: this building was one not only ancient but of considerable splendour and size—and although in the present time, its low walls and pannelled wainscot would have been derided as scarce comporting with the dignity fit for the dwelling of a man whose notions were the least extensive, or who bore his head among the dashing part of the community, yet at the period written of, this same house was considered a complete palace—a wonder of architecture—and together with the new City Hall and prison, which was situated at Coenties Slip, the ornament of the great city; it was a broad square building of stone, painted yellow, with fine gravel walks the whole length of the house, and a huge wide entry, with a double door, and a brazen, snake-twisted, and lion-headed knocker, lustrous with cleaning; its situation was commanding; it was placed on the brow of the hill, on whose rugged sides the white washed walls of the wooden bastions, bristling with demi sacker, falcon and culverin, ran like an encircling serpent almost to the edge of the water, where in sight its white sails trembling in the early twilight, glided along some fleeting periauger bound on its northern river voyage, or where lay at silent anchor on the undulating waves, their black masts shadowing the surface, a whole fleet of yatchen that had made the port, and were hastening to moor beside the Capsey[6] [6] This was the extreme point of the land which divided the north and east rivers, and was about the centre of the present battery. and the protecting docks and Rounduyten,† † There were several fortified rounduyten, that constituted the defence of the city along the east river side. like a brood of young wild fowl hieing to nestle beneath the sheltering wing of the parent bird. On one side, at a distant point, the dusk and vapour of the night, whose shadows were fast spreading around, bounded the prospect, so that the wide river and the dark clouds were mingled as it were in one element. At another view, yet nearer to the eye, were spread the bleak, rugged and desolate land of Pavonia, its hills chequered with tracks of snow, and the bare brown soil which the bright rays of the day, that was now fleeting, had uncovered; and close under the shadow of the beach could be seen the long dark lines of ice that skirted its shores, like the chain about a captive, looking stern, cheerless and wintry, unmoved by the departing beams of the light that lingered longest on them, and played on the cold and frozen visage of the gelid waters, like the faint smiles that cross the brows of the dying ere the last departure; while, yet nearer, almost in the centre current of the stream, borne by the quick and nervous tide, floated onwards with a noise like the hissing of a serpent, huge fragments of the frozen wave, that often in their instant-shaped masses bore pieces of bark that had been peeled by the wind from off the lichen or the fir that waved on the stern and rocky sides of the stoney point, or on the towering heights of the pallisadoes, and which, ere another morning's brightness was born, were dashed about, atoms on the foaming and giant waves of the ocean, or were weltering amid the breakers that wash the beach of the last island that stands the uttermost link between the world of waters and the huge continent; even like the race of life—for how incredible doth it seem that the infant nurtured in the soft luxury of the tropics should moulder in death, after the storm of existence, amid the snows of some polar region. On the other side, close under the battlements of the fort, lay the city; its dark and crowded houses; its close, narrow streets; its wharfs; its magazines, all huddled in one mass, like some great hive, filled with life and riches. A strange diversity, however, did that hill (from whence the ancient governors of the province looked on their metropolis) still stand would present itself to the sight, now street on street, spire on spire, to the very stretch of vision, would have burst on the sight; the smoke of thousands of dwellings would have been seen curled in the blue sky; the masts of mighty shipping pennon on pennon; the hum of commerce, which then to have been dreamed of would have been believed a tale of magic; the rolling and rattling of numerous vehicles, like sounds of distant thunder, would have broke upon the ear, and the thought and eye would have been lost in the vastitude of all on which it turned; while, then one might have counted every dwelling, and have repeated the names of the inmates; for at one gaze every principal object was apparent. Here rose the belfries of the churches, built in the true Duch taste, and shaped after the fashion of the oil jars of Zwannerdam; there was the tiled roof of the Stadhuys, the grandest building in the colony, and, by the best informed worthy of the Manahadoes, said to be only exceeded in the world by the building devoted to the same purpose at Amsterdam; there was, also, the wooden spire of the Borse, an edifice likewise in great estimation, being indisputably the finest of its kind, except the house of the Hanse Towns, the glory of the Osterlingen traders of Antwerp, having a tin weather-cock at the top, by which every New Amsterdammer corrected his wind when he had gone astray in the calculation thereof, and then the long bridge, which ran out in the public dock could be distinguished, crowded with the groodt Burgerrecht, in their red flannel vestcoats, calico morning-gowns and cocked hats, haggling and chaffering with the swearing skippers of the Albanisch yatchen, remarkable for their worsted caps, the manufacture of the knitting vrouws of Ohnewalagantle,[7] [7] Schenectady. and their greasy leathern breeches; while not far distant the skirts of the town were perceptible, with its wooden block houses and palisadoes, its gates, slaughter-house, and taverns; and then there lay the country around, studded interchangeably with hills, commons, and swampy kolcks that were crossed by slight plank bridges, and bounded by innumerable wind-mills, whose huge arms were continually waving in the wind, and the Bowerische Laening, and gay plantagnies from the Crown point† † Corlears Hook. as far as sight could reach. The room in the great house, in which were the characters who are about to be described, was large and spacious, partaking at once of the dignity and grandeur befitting the audience chamber of the ruler of the mighty province of New-Yorke: having great chimney places, with china jambs, decorated with the ancient story of Abraham and Isaac, and marvellously illustrative of other parts of scripture; the walls were lined with pannelled wainscoat, of an antique fashion, whose oaken surface shone lustrous with wax; the ceilings were low and dark, and the windows wondrous wide and short, like embrasures, and the casements were filled with small square panes of glass, of a greenish cast, which had been brought from Bummel, in Guilderland, for the purpose; around were hung numerous paintings, most of which partook of the different tastes that had swayed the various persons who had been masters of this sumptuous residence: there were portraitures of fish, and fruit, and game; of the planting and decorating of May trees; there were country frolics, card playings, and other drolleries of the low countries; the copies of Gerard Dow, Jan Steen, Teniers, and Wouvermans, and also in splendid frames shone forth the family likenesses of most of the former Governors; the ladies in court dresses, and tall stately caps and trim bodices, with hoop petticoats, and waists like hour glasses, with roses in their hands and birds on their jewelled fingers, often representing fair smiling eyed sheperdesses, with crooks and ribands at their feet, and large gold pendants in their ears, and having boys on their laps, intended for cupids, but dressed, in spite of pinions, quiver, and darts, in ample jerkins, with laced ruffles and points, bag wigs, and blue silk small clothes, having also high heeled shoes, with points curling upwards at the toe, like the prows of the canoe of a South-Sea islander, and paste buckles, both at the instep and the knee; while the gentlemen themselves, with stern brows and monstrous mustachios almost hanging down to their starched ruffs, clad with steel cuirasses and breast-plates, and surrounded with all the harness of war, frowned grimly forth from the canvass; on a raised settle in one corner, flourishing in an earthen pot, were several beautiful tulips, from Alemaer, and some other flowers, that were in those times the Hollander's passion;[8] [8] The tulips of Alemaer were very celebrated; at an auction in the year 1637, one hundred and twenty tulips brought the sum of 90,000 guilders, one alone, called the Viceroy, was sold for the sum of 4203 guilders. tables with huge claw feet holding balls, were set out in different parts of the well sanded floor, and a brisk fire crackled on the clean hearth, about whose immediate neighbourhood, partly induced by the severity of the season, and partly by the attraction of its being the station of the entertainers, most of the occupants of the apartment had placed themselves, and the hosts themselves, seemingly proud of being the objects of universal attention, (for, as is always in such cases, the guests like gay butterflies, fluttering in the perfume of lordly flowers, hovered about them) appeared greedily to devour the gratifying flatteries that they were busied in pouring in their ears; and truly they were two stately personages, bearing about them every mark of their dignity, both in apparel and demeanour, and but scantily wanting in confidence of their own worthiness; they had equally that assumed air of greatness, of lofty carriage, of solemn bearing, and that pompous utterance, that in modern instances is so common, that marks our mud-born, dirt-bred, wealth-elated, and self-created gentry, whose greatest accomplishments and virtues consist in their living high, and keeping a splendid Vol. II. 3 equipage; and about these there was that strained condescension in address, that awkward affectation of humility, and that self-sufficient, supercilious air, which we see daily enacted in some mongrel, who, lifted up by the ignorance of popular favour and fortuitous chance, rather than his own deserts, puts on the garment of authority, and would seem all meekness to his equals, while his very soul is o'errun with pride and overbearing tyranny; and indeed such had been the fortunes of Leisler;—his unexpected rise and success, his want of cultivation of mind, while his wife, unused to the place in which she found herself, and but ill adapted to play the part which she was forced to act, that both studious to bear the investitures of state in a becoming fashion, naturally, at times, too far forgot what they had been, in contemplating (what every body else seemed to do) that which they were; and if this feeling was carried to an extreme in the bosom of one more than the other, it was in that of the female, who was in her every action a very daughter of Eve; and there was no lack of foundation in the general rumour, that she was a very devil incarnate of pride, and where her helpmate was deficient, she, like a dutiful spouse, was ever ready to assist him—albeit, the dame's garb was a type of her nature, and at once bespoke her character, for so loaded and bowed down with dress and decoration was she, that she might have been likened to some sumpter caparisoned steed in the pageant, bowing and nodding his head at every step beneath the loads of drooping plumes and embroidered ribands that adorned it—but for a likeness, one need but look in the crowd of these times, and we find that most of our ladies appear to believe that every thing they need possess, are gew-gaws and finery, and when so decked out they will be more admired than if they had no other attractions than modesty, virtue and good sense, things, that with many of the sex are now of less moment than a brilliant head-dress and a rich wreath. How little do they judge the brightest jewel fair woman boasts, is in her purity of heart: and then what need of art—can it excel that which heaven itself hath made? those diamonds in her eyes, her teeth of pearl, and lips of living rubies—so soft, so sweet, formed alone to breathe love's own peculiar eloquence of bliss, and enchain in wilful bondage all that listen to the music, that gathers a deeper witchery from the pass that shapes it. But while treating on this subject dame Leisler is disregarded: a want of respect and a degree of inattention which it is well are committed under the present circumstances, for had it happened otherwise, and in the days of the matron, it would have been long ere forgiveness was granted to a crime which she would have considered of the greatest magnitude, and which it would have gone far did she not resent with a withdrawal of all her good graces and favour from the presumptuous offender. But ere that homage of description is rendered unto her appearance that it so well demanded, it behoves for the information of the reader to premise, lest he be startled at what he might deem incongruous, if not ridiculous in the fashion of the times whereof this is written, that it should be remembered that those days were not as now, when scarce an hour passes ere with indifferent eye we behold the dark prow of some foreign bark laden with the silks, and cloths, and furs of countries which are divided from us by a thousand leagues of ocean, seeking our wharves; when the gaudy mantles and the lace-trimmed dress, the very likeness of those which hung on the white shoulders of the luxurious beauties of the European capitals but a few days before, are to be obtained from the hands of our own tradesmen, who need not encouragement in their extravagance or their wanton profuseness of expense, however adverse to the boasted simplicity of our manners, which a few uninformed, prejudiced fools trumpet alike with the purity of our government and institutions, which are all the same, cankered and rotten. For what lack we in corruption more than the ancient world? younger we are, it is true, but not the less matured in vice, although we want the means —the unbounded riches that are possessed by the hereditary courtiers and titled sycophants, against whose sumptuousness of living, whose idle debaucheries, whose wanton waste of wealth we are inveighing so bitterly; yet, is not our crowd made up of the same materials, if not of a worse kind? Doth not our petty dignitary of a day, though rank with native littleness of soul, in all except the gratification of his own desires, ape in furniture, in show, the pride, the habit, and, as far as able, the prodigal expenditures of the most vile and lavish of the old metropolises? We read, as if in wonder, of the gaudy finery of some foreign gala; the brilliant and costly garbs; the jewelled head dress whose purchase were a fortune; and many say,—thank God, we have not such extremes of unmeasured possession and abject poverty. Ye are blind —ye are besotted—ye are ignorant of your own natures; for look at home—look to yourselves, behold the staring finery of your wives, your daughters. You are not rich —can you afford this? the soft carpets, cushioned and gilded couches, magnificent dwellings, with all their priceless decorations which surround you, and which so plainly speak that, were there an ability with you to carry things to the same extent that you have appeared to contemn, there were no need of desire. And then it should be recollected that if some expend in the great cities (to which our eyes are always bent, in spite of our pretended consequence in our own superiority) their countless gold in banquets, follies, riots and eccentricities, there are many blessed from birth with education, liberal views and tastes, (things that, from our very situation, our great men being but a part of the dregs of society, narrow in principle, devoted to dishonesty and their own interests, are very rare among us;) who extend the open hand unto the deserving; who foster talent and encourage virtue, and whose pride seems to be that of exalting to merited praise the land which they inhabit? Let us not talk of freedom, of virtue beyond our fellows—we have no real freedom, no real virtue. Man is the same, though born in the splendid and luxuriant chambers of a kingly palace, or drawing breath in the cities of the new world; the same, I mean, in ambition, in pride, in weakness; though the first hath the advantage of being accustomed from the cradle to a lofty station, while the latter carries in his place the ignorant vanity and assumption of superiority, natural to little minds suddenly elevated, together with all the despicable ignorance of early education. And further, what do we see so heinous in the actions of the young or old of the nations from whence came our ancestors. Are the women of Gaul more given to looseness of manners, or to actual immodesty and lasciviousness than our own? there may be with us less openness of character, more disguise, more cloaked hypocrisy, but there is little difference as to true virtue, where the very churches are the concerted places of criminal design. Are the men of England more given to the gambling table, the race course or the wassail than our own; it is true from our situation, fortunes cannot be sported at a single cast of the dice, for fortunes are but rare; but are there not hosts of sharpers, jockeys and drunkards in every sphere of our society. Look at the flushed cheek, the feverish lip, the blood-shot eye, yea, the premature old age of our youth, their early graves, if proof be wanted of dissipation. Go to the brothel, the stews, the tavern and the play-house, they are crowded with reckless, beardless boys, rioting and drinking; rushing onwards, unrestrained by their weak guardians, to embrace loathsome disease and death. But it was otherwise in the olden day of the province; there were then but few chances of imitation of the grandeur of the European; for often six long and wearying months would slowly take their flight, and, many times, a year has gone by without one adventurous vessel laving her sides in the waters of the Hudson, having crossed the far sea from the mother country; and when she did come crowds, nay, the whole town would assemble, and look on her hardy navigators in astonishment; question on question would be sought from the master down to the cabin boy, and all would be mad with rumour and news, from the fort of Aurania to Herman Rutger's brew house; the very mariners themselves were gazed on as strange men—beings of another species; who had seen distant countries, who had eat and drank beyond seas, and who, above all, had seen the king. From the discourse of such, from rude description and the ventures brought by these, were the fashions of the province set; which, first being sported by the dames of the big house in the fort, 3* went from them by degrees to the damsels of the Holy Land, and, now and then, would intrude in the house of some Dutch burgher, and mix with the old, unvarying, established habits, which had been left to ya vrouw by her moeder, who probably had inherited them from her moeder's moeder; so that it was in nowise uncommon on great occasions to behold the matrons of Nieuw Amsterdam decked out in garments that liberally partook of the fashions of Holland, England, France, and Spain, all united in motley assemblage on the shoulders of one person, and very seldom did these parts, as it may be supposed, agree either in colours, or were they of the same century, and although this incongruity would not be inapplicable to the dress worn by ladies at present, which often, so they be very showy and fine, have but little regard to being suitable to the modesty, figure, or character of the wearer—how these remarks are relative to the attire of Dame Leisler, which I was about to treat on, the reader himself will be the best judge; for truly she was decorated up to the eyes in all that was then considered splendid, and as is now termed `respectable among the fashionables,' that is, she looked as if she was somebody; for she was a woman on whom almost any thing might be put, and it would be `vastly becoming, and amazingly genteel;' indeed, as is vulgarly said, she was an armful: built like a herring hoy, or a Dutch dotkin, measuring more round the waist than she appeared to have in height, with a little red nose, as brilliant as a ruby, small sparkling eyes, and cheeks shining like a kitchen maid's, and a chin hanging like a bladder, while, to increase such charms, on her head she wore a huge, monstrous, crisped and curled powder tower, which supported as it was, looked like a lighthouse built upon a mile stone, or rather a church steeple on the top of a hogshead; her face, moreover, after the style (ludicrous enough; but what will not fashion do?) that had, but a short period before, reigned generally among the ladies of the English Court, was literally seamed and depatched with sundry pieces and strips of black sticking plaister, representing in varied forms, coaches and horses, half-moons and stars, all placed, however, by her tirewoman in an artful manner, to set off the sly darts cast by Cupid, by means of winning smiles and dimples, that, with the most delightful expression, always, (except in certain moments, which usually chanced when she and her husband were undisturbed with the presence of a third person,) lighted up her jovial visage; added to what has been already particularized, was a gown of flame coloured brocade, somewhat faded it is true, but amply figured and flowered with monstrous tulips, Dutch pinks, and staring roses; and then her waist was set off with an enormous stomacher, and although her sleeves scarcely reached to her elbows, yet the richly laced and highly worked ruffles that depended therefrom, hung nearly to the end of her fingers, while there was not a portion, however diminutive, of her attire, but was flaunted with gay furbelows and ribands of a bright calico colour—thus decorated and adorned, it is no wonder that her husband, poor man, on this occasion as in many others, sunk in the scale of comparison, for though there was not much difference in similitude of figure, he being a broad backed, heavy moulded looking man, yet in movement she had comparatively the advantage, for she glided about her room of audience, among the swarm of Dutch damsels assembled, like a shining gold fish, swimming round his glass prison; nevertheless, it must be confessed, she forgot not her elevation for a moment, for she bore her body in such action with the true air of condescension and grandeur and indeed carried her head loftily, with a neck, as is vulgarly described, as stiff as a poker —On the other hand, Jacob Leisler, as it should have been before remarked, amid all his strained authority, wore to the inquiring eye, a certain look of care and uneasiness, that in spite of the inflated mightiness with which he acted, and which he doubtless supposed necessary to create respect among his followers evidently tortured him; and labouring under such feelings his heavy countenance showed his mind abstracted, and often his thoughts wandered from the scene before him to the hopes on which he lived, and to the gathering clouds which were rolling towards him: the disappointments and defection of his partizans, that hourly were increasing; the obstinacy of the country, the steady manner with which Schuyler, the Mayor of Albany, refused his offers of alliance, and the encouragement and protection he granted to the fugitives and bitter enemies of his name, Van Kortlandt, Bayard, and Graham; the coolness which subsisted between the people of the country and his son-in-law Milborne, who, on entering Albany, had rashly and arbitrarily confiscated the property of many of the principal inhabitants, who had absconded at his approach; all these pressed like a weight of lead upon his heart, and he unfortunately possessed too little of the self-confidence and command of visage necessary for a statesman to conceal his anxiety. He was a stout, brawny, square shaped man, having a stolid and unmeaning set of features; thick eyebrows shaded his dull and inexpressive blue eyes, and his hair was of a dark brown hue, cut close to his forehead; he had short mustachios on his upper lip, and a strait peaked beard grew unshorn from his chin; he was arrayed in the solemn and dignified habit of a substantial burgher, with dark grey stockings rolled over his knees, and immense buckles and buttons, the last neither inconsiderable in number or size, a profusion also of the same ornaments graced, in triple rows, a vest of scarlet velvet, the flaps of which came to his knee buckles; to complete this dress, a stout degen, of the true Williamstadt manufacture, with a great ivory hilt, was girded to his side, while ready for use, at the wall near at hand, hung a huge three cornered beaver, and a tortoise shell cane, with a china head and silken tassels. On the day, the evening of which is now referred to, the city had been much disturbed with riot and turmoil that seemed nearly to threaten an open insurrection: some of the citizens, who had heretofore expressed a quiet submission to the authority of Leisler, had suddenly been stirred up, and apparently without cause, had demanded a change of the council, while on the other hand, the steady adherents of the government had strenuously opposed the measure—the business had been carried to such high excitement, that large bodies of men had assembled together, often armed with clubs and offensive weapons, and every public place was swarmed with persons who were violently canvassing the merits of the disputation, inflaming with seditious words their own anger and that of their hearers; together with this, reports were currently circulated that a new governor, unfavourable to the Leisler faction, had been appointed, and might be momently expected to arrive, and it was even said that Bayard and Nichols, the latter as bitter a foe as the former to the present power, had been seen among the people urging them against their opponents and irritating the passions of the multitude; and although Milborne had gone forth and declaimed loudly at every point which appeared to be disturbed, yet much of his words were lost on his listeners, who had often received them in a manner that at once bespoke impatience and dissatisfaction; however, as it grew later in the day, the exertions of Leisler's friends were apparently more successful, and the feelings of the burghers allayed, so that things had again resumed their former aspect of security, and the repose becoming an honest Dutch city, once more reigned in the narrow streets, which was more palpably evinced by the afternoon's audience; whereat, (and the fashion of holding a levee had been usual with the other rulers of the province, once every half year, a custom which Leisler had thought proper to follow, as by giving a public reception to the principal citizens, he might probably inspirit or increase his party,) there were congregated a great number of the inhabitants, some induced to attend the audience by their political sentiments, but by far the greater herd, as is often equally remarkable in our own times, by no care for the cause or the giver of the feast, but merely for their own sakes—for what they could get; indeed, the very pride of the Dutch youth and beauty of New Yorke were present in that audience chamber, and it was with no mean display of gallantry that many a doughty Mynheer, with his hands in his breeches pockets, strutted beside his favourite damsel, who, clad in all her beauty, her red calico short gown, her yellow ear drops, and her necklace of beads of bright amber as large as marbles, her scarlet kirtle, hood and wimple, a neat, buxom, bouncing deity, fit for a Hollander's admiration, simpered and blushed as she was gallanted through the muddy paths of Petticoat Lane, down the long hill of der Warmoes-straet,[9] [9] Now called Garden-street, to the heeren gracht up the hill to the Governor's; where, entering at the kitchen door, for the great hall entrance was never known to be unclosed, except upon a marriage or burial, as hath ever been an invariable Dutch custom, and which was brought over by the groodt Francois Rombout from Brock, they strided lovingly into the grand chamber of reception, which has been described; where, leaving the object of his attention in the crowd of her own sex there convened, who were industriously engaged in knitting and talking scandal, Mynheer sought his own male acquaintances, with whom he lighted his pipe, drank raspberry wine and eat cookies, trolled a low Dutch love song, or talked with the schepin, the knostabel, or the hoofdt schout, on the affairs of the day, until the hour of departure, which was duly and seasonably announced by the city bell, which rang loudly from the steeple of the Gereformeerde Kerck, (a spire, which, by the way, was believed to be superior to the handsome one on the cathedral of Utrecht and whose bell always tolled the hour except when the ringer over-slept himself in an afternoon's siesto, which he was accustomed to indulge in after drinking a plentiful draught of genever;) a half an hour before the tat-too beat at the fort, when the city gates were closed, and every honest burgher put on his night cap and crept between his warm striped woollen blankets, making himself as comfortable as possible, and consigned himself at once to sleep and dreams of Butter-vlict cheese, and all the luxuries of his Vaderlandt. The hour for returning had come, and each stately Mynheer sought from the assemblage his own charge, and taking ya vrouw by the arm, and enfolding himself up from the clear frosty night, he hastened his way homeward, leaving the dogter under the care of her liefhebber to follow his footsteps, which, though not long, far, as it may be supposed, outstripped those of the jongvrouw and her chosen, who both, perhaps, unconsciously enwrapt by sweet discourses of Low Dutch, musical and mellifluous, of mingled vows and tales of eternal constancy, had wandered away in the loveliness of the night, to enjoy the lonely solitudes of Vlatten Barrack, and the Green lane, e'er the city gates were shut and the guard set; making, in the old saying, the longest way round the shortest home. Party after party slowly prepared to separate from the gay group they had heretofore commingled with; every body was on the move, and the crowd momently lessened, leaving only those behind at last, who love to be the longest, or who lingered round the comfort of a foreign hearth, from an experience of the uncomfortableness of that at home. Here might be seen a careful dame, tucking up her fardingales, or wrapping beneath her cloak sundry cribbed cookies destined for the children, who, as she remarked, poor things, were at home, no doubt, looking for Sante-claus, and they ought not to be neglected; there was her helpmate, buttoning his jerkin close under his chin and tying his handkerchief round his ears, waiting ya vrouw's leisure, who had a thousand remembrances to whisper her acquaintances, and was an hour at least in taking leave of the entertainers, while her impatient lord stood fidgetting, fuming, and worrying himself sick at her delay, but which seemed to move her not one jot; and while his visage grew as sour as a cucumber, she wisely gave his humour full time to change, and whatever heat, that might have invaded the equanimity of a usual placable temper, in his impatience a sufficient opportunity to cool, a thing not likely in a phlegmatic Nieuw Nederlander to happen in a moment, except when brought to such utter extremity by kicking his heels unattended to, and waiting for a spouse who spurned his honest control in an exposed and wind swept hall on a winter's evening. SECTION I.—Concluded. This let me hope, that when in public view I bring my pictures, men may feel them true; `This is a likeness,' may they all declare, `And I have seen him, but I know not where;' For I should mourn the mischief I had done, If as the likeness all should fix on one. —Crabbe. Though now the apartment had become thinned of its guests, and in proportion to the former number who had througed it, deserted, yet there still lingered about the tables, which now were only defaced with the scattered remnants of their late luxurious loads, emptied jars that had foamed with rich beer from Wappinger's Creek, flasks half drained smoked out pipes, with the ashes in heaps at their sides, and seas of liquor that had been spilled by the revellers; a few persons, some of whom actively engaged in wrangling on some disputed topic, while others dozing on their seats from want of better employment, or sleeping o'er the dull prosing of some endless, long-winded, talking Hollander, who had taken under his especial care the safety of the whole universe, and who decided on the propriety of every political movement of moment that had been lately made in Europe as well as the Nieuw Nederlandts, were heedless of the weariness of their hosts, and appeared to make no preparation for quitting their seats, although every body around them was on the move for speedy departure. Characters of this description are to be found in every situation of society; men, forgetful of the cheer extended them, who bear down, and fairly wear out hospitality, imposing on decency and good manners, and who may be fairly classed under that denomination of personages whom the house-wives describe as wearing at a visit their `sitting breeches. The very type of this long anchored species, were two individuals, who had taken their places, probably for the sake of observing those who withdrew from the room, on a long settle that stood a few paces from the door: the one of these was a man of such towering stature, that when he stood, even with an inclination of the head, the crown of his beaver came unsociably in contact with the low and smoky ceiling of the apartment; while the other was a clear reverse of figure to his companion, being one of those short-necked, pudding-headed, double-bodied fellows, who have not an inch of limb to spare, and whose flesh is comfortably rolled round them like the warm fleece round the unshorn sheep; the taller was a broad, leathern faced looking character, with a swearing stare, and a nose that predominated over the rest of his features in the shape of a punch ladle, and bearing at the extremity a deep copper tinge; his hair was of an iron grey colour, and his appearance bespoke him a man of some consequence, and indeed he was no less a personage than schepin Jacobus Kip, Roymeester, and candidate for the place of der heer officier, while the little man, who sat beside him, an almost silent listener, was a Dutch apothecary and doctor of medicine, bred at the schools of Hoorn, where he became, as his comfortable person bespoke, a proficient in the delicious study of fat beef, good butter, and `groene kaas;' he was called Hans Kierstede, and truly he was a most appropriate companion for schepin Kip; for he had on that evening, as was his custom at all good opportunities, given his predominant propensity of eating its full range and sway, and he was at its close situated somewhat as the monstrous constrictor of the East, who after his bloody banquet, stretches himself out in the shade, listless and incapable of action; and much so it fared with honest Hans, who being what is commonly termed brimful of the feast, and stuffed like a tick with good fare, was in an excellent mood of patient hearing, while his associate, who was one who had from his station, a fair opportunity of an extensive acquaintance, both among the groodt und klien Burgerrecht von Nieuw Yorck, and was withal greatly given to the uncharitable Vol. II. 4 propensity of reflecting on the characters and actions of his neighbours with ungodly virulence when once set out, between the arduous discussion of a half emptied pipe, took the whole conversation to himself, uninterrupted by his half dozing hearer, except when, after some long and minute scrutiny of all about him, in an interval of wakefulness, occasioned by the violent gestures and utterance of Mienheer Kip, there was enforced on his sight the rapid demolition of the viands that had been prepared for the company, and the scraps that now remained in their places; then, as roused by such destruction, the doughty Kierstede edged in some proper culinary stricture, and forgetful of his own avidity at their consumption, he deprecated the fashion of the cookery that had been used, and sometimes where he praised, (for some few of the dishes he admitted were commendable, though not more than to pass,) he added a lugubrious lamentation, that from want of appetite and weakness of digestion, he had not been enabled to do justice to that which had been set before him. From where these worthies sat, all who departed from the room were conspicuous to their observation, and it will not be wondered at, that the remarks of schepin Kip on his fellow burghers partook largely of his spleenful and cynical disposition. “Mien goodt mans, Hans Kierstede,” quoth the schepin, familiarly clapping his hand on his neighbour's thigh, and puffing his pipe through one corner of his mouth, while he directed the apothecary's attention to a little man with a bald head and a hitch in his gait, who was bowing and scraping, and wriggling and smiling, and holding, with all the apparent warmth of friendship and of an attached heart, the hand of the Lieutenant Governor, as he paid him his obeisance at departure, while Leisler seemed to reciprocate his kindness, as conscious of his worth and faithfulness—“Mien goodt man, Hans Kierstede,” said Jacobus Kip in low Dutch, to the doctor of medicine, (though his words are here translated for the benefit of the reader;) “I tell you this, my friend, and I promise you the truth when you listen to what I tell you: you see that man with his bow and his smile, his ready hand and bending head, like a Chinese mandarin; you know him as you would know a bad stuyver, my friend Hans; then I tell you this, he is as big a rogue as you will see with your eyes between Nieuw Amsterdam and Dort, from which my grandfather came I tell you this, he will cut his own mother's throat for a bad dotkin—what do you say to that, my man, Hans Kierstede?” “Dat vas a vat kapoen, a ver vine pird,” muttered the auditor, who with thoughts intent on a more generous subject, had heard but little of the invective of his querulous companion; “tish drue,” said Hans, “dat pird wash tesberate pad tressed; dey do dings betters at Hoorns.” “My mans, Hans Kierstede,” continued schepin Kip, unconscious in his warmth, to the lack of the apothecary's attention to his discourse, “I tell you this, Dirk Von Rikketie is a great knave; he that trusts to him may venture on the ice in the Overslaugh in spring weather; see how he bows and grins, as if his back was as crooked as the Y; you think from his looks he is the friend of Leisler; for all that, you see, I tell you this, Hans Kierstede, he is no more the friend of Leisler than he is that of Claus Bayard; he is his own friend alone—one man is up on the ladder, the other is at the foot; Dirk contrives to keep place with all—this morning he followed Orloffe and Claus; the evening comes, he is with Leisler, and to-morrow if Bayard stands where Leisler now stands, I tell you this, Dirk bows and grins to Claus, as at all times he had been his stoutest follower—see there, he limps away with himself,” pursued Mienheer Kip, as the person whose merits he had descanted on disappeared from the apartment, “so the devil limps. I wonder whether with all his bad deeds, his sycophancy and hypocrisy, if Dirk sleeps like an honest man—his head is bald and venerable; but what think you of his heart, Hans Kierstede?” “Dat gans—mien zeil! Burgomaster Brezier eat dat gans, Ik had nien a morzhel do but mit mien deeth,” responded Kierstede, “but twash padly kooked doo; Mienheer Kip, I vill deach you der ding, you kan dell beople's py de way dey tress der gans, niet te nien, der gans if stewed closh mit zourgrout, would nien pe zo pad zdill; dey kooks gans at Hoorn in dat vashion, Mienheer Kips.” Mienheer Jacobus impatiently shrugged up his shoulder at the abrupt and untimely remarks of the little doctor of medicine, and he drew a long whiff from his pipe at the unrelenting stupidity of his companion, and for the moment determined to waste on his dull ear no farther words; but he was not able to hold good his resolution, as there sailed past him to the door, in all the pomp of importance, a huge, lusty, black-browed man, upon whose arm hung, in amorous fondness, a plain little Dutch woman, her small grey eyes simpering from under her crimped Flemish cap upon her massy protector. “Mien man, Hans Kierstede,” broke forth the schepin, as he beheld the fond couple move by him, “you see that man with his wife, who is just gone through the door;—'tis Doctor Kindermeester, that has married the rich widow of our old burgher—what a strut and splutter he makes! but he is all strut and splutter, puff and blaze, while his great carcass and brains are hollow and empty— plenty of room in his skull for the wind he sends forth— I tell you my friend, he looks like an ox, and his brains are like an ox's brains. By my trow, heavy and dull enough; though, Hans Kierstede, he deserves credit for his ingenuity, when he imposed on the Burgomasters at Leyden, and sold them for a vast quantity of guilders, a stinking cabbage patch, advising the besotted purchasers to make it a public physic garden, like the Felix Meretis. Ho! ha!” and the schepin chuckled as he spoke, “what think you, Hans Kierstede? he purposed to read lectures! well, I'll tell you then, he pockets the pay and the lectures remain in the books from whence he steals all his lectures; for, Hans, it is convenient for such men who want minds to steal it from the works of others; and while he dissipated a fortune got by such fraud, the stink weed and the pudding stone are the most flourishing plants that adorn his famous physic garden; and that is not all let me tell you, my man, Hans Kierstede, this great bladder of a fellow, would have had the burgomasters believe him a very Boerhaave; but let me tell you the truth, my friends den Hogen Mogenheid of Vaderlandt, are not such fools; and when they doubted doctor Kindermeester's pretensions, he kicked and huffed in a great dudgeon; and now out of pure spite, and mortification, he hath come to the Nieuw Nederlandts to set up a school of medicine that will make the professors in the low countries die with envy and spleen, and this, my man Hans, he promises to do without a guilder from the stadt. Let me tell you my friend, it is very well for men when they have no credit with their high mightinesses, having once imposed on them like this doctor Kindermeester, to say they do not want a guilder to assist their vain projects from the public pocket—the truth is, let the offer be made, or let there be a chance of getting something from the stadt, and then see whether these boasters would not snap at it as greedily as a hungry cur would at a kitchen bone—I tell you the truth, Hans Kierstede, this fat doctor of medicine is all vapour and conceit: he pokes his nose in the first places to make the credulous burghers believe him a great man; but I tell you my man Hans, it can do an ass no good to pass for a lion, for the more he moves the more you see his tail; and the truth is as to Doctor Kindermeester, that of one half he meddles in he knows as little as the salmon fish that bounces in the Maes—” “Zalmon, schepin Kip? mien hertz!” said doctor Hans Kierstede, rubbing his eyes as if just awakened, and having only heard the last words addressed to him: “Zalmon! dish ish as vone vine vish ven dey kooks him as you sall zee zerved on a burgomaster's tinner dable— mien hertz, how dey kooks him mit budder and kreens at Hoorn—Got! mien moud vaders at der dought op him tressed mit Zauce—mien zeil, dat Hoorns de blace mit der kokwinkels, Mienheer Kip.” Mienheer Kip turned in evident vexation from his companion, and petulantly for a while employed himself in silence to the finishing of his pipe, as he could not but perceive from the little apothecary's manner, that he had scarcely understood a word with which he had honoured 4* him, and until startled by the mention of an eatable, had fairly been nodding in a short dose; but however offended he was for the moment with his chuckle-pated listener, such temptation to invade the reluctant taciturnity of the schepin was not to be withstood, as presented itself in the dress, assumed airs of importance, and well known characters of the guests who passed him, as they flitted from the apartment like shadows by a glass, which reflected their form and shape, nor concealed a deformity; but in truth it is but justice to the memory of the schepin (who, by the by, lies buried in the churchyard of Garden-street Church, not far from burgomaster Peachy Prauw Van Zandt,) to state that with a small allowance to his splenetic temper, which in later years had been increased by the Vroedschap's rejecting all his plans for public improvement, as they were so disinterested and economical that they would not, if put in operation, have yielded a farthing by way of speculation or contract to any dignified burgomasters, whether he was a tailor or a dirt contractor, that in his description of such as fell under his perview, he did not greatly exaggerate the fact; and therefore it can be judged from those attributed by schepin Jacobus Kip to their forbears, what virtues the descendants of the honest, staunch, and thrifty burghers of Nieuw Amsterdam in der Nieuw Nederlandts, have inherited and improved on; and although mankind, it may be asserted, progresses slowly in most matters of civilization in many parts of this habitable world, the province of New-York is certainly not one of them; for the quick intellect of the Yankee, and the steady bottom of the Dutchman, being well grafted together, have produced a stock whose fruitfulness in all arts, (fas et nefas,) may bid defiance for comparison to the whole globe. Vain were it to give an accurate outline of the multifarious remarks on the many rich subjects of sarcasm that flowed from the lips of the worthy schepin, and were unheard by the dull hearing (or rather when he was listening and awake, passed in one ear and went out of the other) of the excellent doctor of medicine, his companion, by whose evidence the assailed never could have convicted Mienheer Kip of slander; (for truth in slander and libel, by some learned civilians, and most particularly Dirk Von Rikketie, when it affected men in power, and of course his friends, was reckoned inadmissable and very criminal, and always received from his immaculate judgment, severe animadversion, and a committal to the Rasphuis;) for doctor Hans Kierstede was a veritable and patient being, who never in his whole life contrived to remember a word of the shortest story he ever heard, and his memory was never burthened beyond a recipe for cookery of some kind or the other, and that he conned for weeks, as a student doth his exercise; he was indeed a creature that took the world easy, and lived for nothing but eating Group after group moved on in their departure, and but few slipped away unobserved by the keen eye and sharp tongue of the honest Mienheer, who was seldom in his strictures known to be more lenient to an ass though covered with gold, than had he but worn a shabby packsaddle; for he was a sad enemy of those who, swollen with new gotten wealth, assume airs of grandeur and consequence, and forgetful of their own origin, would be thought of a race superior to their fellow burghers, the very matter of their pride showing their ignorance,—because, who that boasted sense, would suppose that either high living, drinking, or dressing; can elevate one piece of worthless clay beyond another, or make the blood and body of the grandson of a footman and washerwoman better than his ancestors.—No; there is much in the Italian proverb when applied to the fair and gorgeous garments, and the boasted family of so vain a coxcomb: that a white glove often covers a dirty hand; certainly it ought to be apparent to such pieces of pampered insignificance, that Providence, when it modelled the form of the veriest vagrant that begs along the public streets, took as much pride and care as in the making of a prince. Mienheer Kip, in his survey, did by no means spare this sort of gentry; for their conceit and impudence was a thing of singular mirth to him—and he chuckled heartily at his own conception as a young burgher and his new married bride sallied past him, with an excess of airs and affectation; scarce deigning in their haughtiness of pride to recognise, even by a nod, the honest schepin, who had smoked many a pipe and drank many a pot of beer with their father, who had been an honest Dutch cooper, and got himself a comfortable fortune, which was all his children seemed to have inherited from him; for no sooner did they possess his money than they endeavoured to shut from remembrance the means whereby he acquired it, and could not bear the sight of a hoop or a stave; while, to impose on others and make it believed their descent was beyond reality, having heard such were the fashions in the old countries they got an ingenious painter to compose a coat of arms, but such a one it was as would have puzzled a herald to have read: it was surmounted by a cap, purporting to be a ducal coronet, and many other rare and magnificent devices, of which the bearers were extremely proud, and which, when recognised by schepin Kip on sundry corners of their apparel, he marvelled first greatly thereat; for the painter, being a native born Nieuw Nederlander, and having never seen the coronet of a duke, had thereon exercised his fancy and shaped it rather clumsily, so that the ready eye of Mienheer Kip at first took it to be no other than the representation of half a butter firkin (such as the honest cooper used to fashion for the goed vrouws of Goshen) after it had been sawed in twain, as was often the custom of the saving citizens of Nieuw Amsterdam, and which hath been even handed down to these days, the separate halves making two excellent tubs; but on the schepin's taking a more certain sight, (and he laughed hugely at the idea) he in his own mind determined the coronet was no other than a representation of old Schermerhorne's of Schenectadie, (with whom the cooper's family had become related by intermarriage,) red worsted nightcap, which the Dutchman (for he was dogwhipper, as is related somewhere before in this veritable historie, to his native town,) used to clap on his head when his beaver was mislaid, when he rushed out of his homestead in pursuit of some noisy cur, the terror of boys and dogs. At the same time there occurred from the incident to the memory of schepin Kip, his having been terrible put out to understand the meaning of a shield with a bar or cheveron, that Mienheer Walton, the rich barber, had placed over his street door in the large new house he had just erected; and the thought struck the schepin forcibly, that it was an act of great humility in the barber, who, although he had become an immense rich man, would not forget his original mean occupation, but wished to remind the world of what he had been and how he had made his money; for the ingenious Kip construed the shield into a representation of a barber's basin, flattened by the unskilfulness of the carver, and the cheveron into an open razor. And indeed the schepin was an admirer of humility in all persons, and it is not suprising that his very bowels rose within him in bitterness at the many airs of mock greatness that passed under his observation; but he was most particularly angered, and that almost beyond control, when he was rather rudely and bearishly rubbed against, (as if he had been a nobody,) and his pipe nearly knocked from him in passing, by a little, stout, squab built personage, so vastly distended with his own magnitude as scarce to be able to see any one except his own all-important figure, and at the same time taking room to make a most significant gesticulation and shrug, as he closed one eye and with a manner the most portentous, ejaculated to a lean, trembling looking man at his elbow, the words `you know,' which seemed to make the poor fellow shrink into himself with terror; without ceremony, as if it had not been in the way, this worthy trod on the foot of schepin Kip, till it made him wince again with the weight, and then moved out of the room without apologizing by a word to the poor burgher, who could not speak for the pain inflicted so ruthlessly on him, but kept shaking up and down the aching limb, now putting it on the floor, then raising it up, all the while groaning, and moaning, and twisting, and drawing up with many ludicrous and lugubrious contortions his long features, while tears of agony rolled down his stout visage. “Confound the usurer—tuyvil! dirty dousand dams! oh my corns! he's broke my toe”—growled, with the very tone of a wounded mastiff, the injured schepin, interlarding every broken sentence with the flourishes of a dozen High Dutch oaths, that made all around stare at him; “Myn Got! his foot's like a horse's; no wonder, he was bred in a stable—tuyvel und dunder! he's crushed the worst corn I had. One would have believed he never handled corn in the crib of the stable where he first began the world, he has so little mercy on mine— Oh my corns! oh my toe!” “Mien hertz! dish is nien der zeazen vor korns; dough dey are goot poiled mit vleesh;” quoth Hans Kierstede, wakening from a long nap in surprise, and not at first perceiving the wry faces of schepin Kip, which, however, when he beheld, he added in a tone of pity and condolence: “Mienheer Kip, mien hertz! vats de madders mit u?” It may well be supposed when the schepin had, by long and tender assiduities, somewhat lulled the biting sharpness of his pain, that he launched out rather virulently against the cause of his anguish, and ran the burgher most violently down behind his back, and called him by many hard names, and related at every twinge of his toe, some tough story concerning the way he had attained great wealth, from being at first an ostler in the stables of a burgher of Ostend; and how, even out of the sweepings of his master's stables, he had made money; and that from only looking at the back of the Dutch bible instead of the inside, when he said his prayers, he had now the assurance to assert it was no harm to take as many per cent for loans that he had made, under good security, to the necessitous as he pleased, and therefore the dominie was never able to persuade him to obey the law of Holland as to interest, because he did not think it allowed sufficient profit; so that his interest very soon, in most cases, was as great as the principal he first advanced. But in the midst of his invectives against this cause of his torture, the worthy schepin could not but laugh to himself, as nearly to forget his hurt, at the recollection of the burgher's being once finely tricked in his own way, by a sharp witted Yankee, who sold him a horse; and the schepin considered it a prime, first rate, capital joke, that he who had skinned so many in his time, should have been at last caught by the false skin of an animal he was bred up with. “His hand,” said Mienheer Kip, “must certainly have been out with the curry-comb, or it could not have been possible, my mans, Hans Kierstede, to have so nicely shut his eyes with the blinds.” Mienheer Kip continued his censures on others of the guests at great length, after the pain of his toe had fairly departed, and he considered himself so fully revenged on the uncivil inflictor of the injury, as to turn his attention to those who followed him from the apartment on their way homewards. “My mans, Hans Kierstede,” said Mienheer, and his very words are used, there not being the same necessity to make them good English as induced me before to render them as far as ability allowed, for the edification of the reader; “my mans, Hans Kierstede,” quoth he, in a broken Low Dutch, half English and half Hollandt, “and der Ik dells u ish oud Jan Van Schraper Vander Blasbull, der Schilder, der bainder mensch—dat bainds his mensch's hoeds vlad like der dimber dat is gut vor poards at Zwoll in der Vaderlandt, and dere Ik dells u is der groodt vendu meester dat was a bakkerjongen— his kopt is as high as der Koning—Ik dells u—der mensch has dravelled, und mit der zites dat he's zeen, his kopt has raiszed lik pread ven tish lighdt as a veader— der liddel bubble dat has noding in it altyg zwims on der dop op der rivier—Ik dells u dis, Hans Kierstede.” “Ja!” replied his hearer, “dat brandewynt is goot vor niets—Mienheer Jakopus Kip, u shoud daste der brandewynt at Hoorn; mien hertz, dats brandewynt— Mienheer, Ik dakes und drinks do your brosberity mit mine brosberity.” “Dank you, mien mans, Hans Kierstede,” returned the schepin, “I dells u dis—mien ogten! dere goes Gelyn Verplancke and Stopher Hoagland, and Bay Croe Svelt— mien ogten! dere de tap toe peads, and we sall be shud in der kates; Ik had nien a dought dat id vas zo ladte, mien mans, Hans Kierstede—tis dime wy gets on—Ik sall lend u mien arms drou Bridge-straadt—zo leds gaan mit der resdt von dem.” And as he spoke, having knocked the ashes from his pipe, followed by his associate, he hastened with mighty strides towards the door, which they had scarcely attained ere their further progress was arrested by a crowd of persons whose entrance in the apartment by the outlet which they were seeking, opposed and prevented their leaving it. The drum, whose sound had invaded the quiet flowings of Mienheer Kip's remarks, and which he had supposed was the usual warning for retirement to all honest and peaceable citizens, had, however, on this evening been beaten for entirely another purpose—it was an alarm, and in a few minutes was followed by the hoarse and heavy clangor of the city bells, whose doleful tongues pealed forth in notes of terror to the awakened and startled burghers of Nieuw Amsterdam—who in the memory of man had heard the like but twice before, once while stout old Stuyvesant prepared for the approach of his conqueror, Colonel Nichols, and lastly when the news came that the dastard Manning had surrendered to Evertse and Benkes, and that their fleet was coming down the Narrows with all sail set for the city of the Manahadoes. As the sound continued, its dread voice swept over the deep and massy heap of crowded buildings, and invading the close and heavy defiles that composed the darksome streets, burst on the ear of the slumbering inhabitants. The tardy Nederlander turned on his couch, and shook his wearied limbs, and rubbed his eyes, and stared about him astonished as the noise struck his ear; the wary trafficker, whose storehouses were filled with merchandise, leaped from his couch in a moment—and the light rest of the lover was driven from eyes where it scarce had lingered. An instant past the city had appeared like some serpent coiled harmless in his dusky ring, stirless as though his fangs were palsied in death,—the brief space of time is fled, his repose hath been disturbed, his barbed tongue darts fire, and his very skin glitters in his anger,—so, through every corner of the late midnight which had slept upon the city, lights break and flash vividly, as stars shooting in the firmament, from casement to casement they flare; and heads yet in their nightgear were thrust from the half opened door and unclosed window forth into the streets, and voice after voice hailed those who came within reach of the cry, but who, scarce attending to the call, passed onwards—eager yet fearful to inquire the rise of the disturbance. Soon all were in motion; those who had been hurrying home belated, joined the throng, and those who had but so lately quitted the scene of revelry at the fort, and who were wandering off on their separate ways, turned back their steps, seeking as they went, at their neighbours and those whom they met, the sudden cause which all alike were hastening to learn: and, although the truth was to them unknown, there were not wanting veracious wiseacres, as is usual at such times, who started a hundred wild and groundless suggestions, which, however palpably preposterous and remote from the slightest foundation, were satisfactorily sworn to by their authors, and lacked no small number of believers. Some cried that the Indians, having fired Beverwyck and Schenectady, had come down the river, massacreing, burning, and scalping men, women, and children; sparing neither the head of the aged, nor the feeble bodies of the helpless infant and its tender mother—that they had landed at Vredendaal, and were now at Golden Hill, ready to rush upon the strengthless palisades of the city. Some had seen them frightfully painted and armed—others had been deafened with their savage war whoops. Some had another tale of terror, which they anxiously sought to force on the credence of their ready hearers: that the ancient foemen, the French, had a fleet riding at Naijarlij; that Nottens island was in their possession; that they had erected batteries, which were ready at a word to sweep the whole town to ashes; that unless the council, which was understood to be convened for the purpose, instantly surrendered, that the flames of their dwellings would light the march of the unrelenting and ruthless enemy, and that all would indiscriminately Vol. II. 5 be given to the slaughtering knife—while others yet more timid, trembled at the monster they themselves conjured, reported that the danger that threatened was even nearer at hand—it was within their own homes— there was, they told an insurrection among the negroes, who had set the city on fire at several different quarters, and were running about like devils, cutting the throats of all they found; and that although the flames spread terrifically that on account of the vast quantities of smoke, the light of the ascending blaze was obscured from the eyes of those who looked in the directions pointed out as the places where the destructive element was raging—and lastly, there were not a few who whispered about, serious in tone and visage, that the time was arrived foretold by the ill-treated Yokup Van Veltzlear, who had a few years previous, pretending to be divinely inspired, made a terrible hue and cry in the streets, crying on the bridge and before the houses of the Hon. Stenwyck and John Lawrence, “wo, wo to the crowne of pride and the drunkearts of Ephreim! Two woes past and the third coming, except you repent, repent—repent, as the kingdome of God is at hand;” and for which solemn prophecy, he had been most unceremoniously and soundly flogged by the common hangman, Anthonie De, who being a proper long-limbed, close-fisted, New-England man, always took good care to let every body who came under his thumb by means of the law, know him so well as to steer clear of his fingers thereafter; and after said flagellation, Yokup was kicked out of the colony by order of the reprobate Dutch Governor who then reigned, and who, it was said, never repented, except over a brandy bottle when it was emptied of its contents—all this persecution it was now remembered that Yokup had endured patiently and meekly; proving perfectly the old saw, that a prophet is never respected in his own country. Stirred by these several rumours, the free-hearted patriot, who had heretofore, at every public opportunity, offered his fortune and his life to the service and protection of his native land, began to wish in spite of himself, that his property was in a safe place, and took more than one serious thought of how in the confusion he might convey away his person unharmed. The gallant leader of the enrolled citizens, who the day before had manfully swaggered and strutted at the head of his followers, and courageously flourished his thirsty steel, anxious for its trial on the carcasses of any who dared front him, now was seized, most unfortunately for the display of his valor, by an unaccountable weakness in the knees and eyesight; the latter being brought to so poor a state that he was unable to find the deadly weapons of his defence —so, feeling unfit for duty, yet troubled for the welfare of the city, while departing therefrom for the benefit of country air, he sent word to the next in command, who, however, (for one misfortune never comes alone) was not to be heard of, for being a tailor, (it is the fashion for tailors to be great military characters) he had, in the phrase of his trade, taken with his goose and thimble long stiches, and was snugly buttoned in his cellar pantry —while the pompous Burgomaster on the other hand, was started to such activity, that he actually ran to the Council Chamber, determined that no time should be lost ere he gave his vote that the commander of the foe (if such was arrived) should be received with all due honours; that a Committee should be deputed to wait on him with a congratulatory address, and escort him to a public dinner, to which, nevertheless, orders were specially to be given that none but the private friends of the members of the corporation should be invited—a maxim since come to universal adoption, the public being taxed and their name used to fatten a whole herd of aldermen and their families, while they themselves, the public, who pay for these feasts, have not the eating of a mouthful, being literally situated like a man who gives a splendid dinner or merry making in his own house, yet is obliged by his guests to remain without doors during the entertainment; or if, as it had been otherwise stated by the rumour, that the town was already on fire, the burgomaster resolved, that efficient measures should be taken to turn the tide of the flame, if it chanced to come in the direction of his property, to that of certain neighhours who resided in an adjoining street, for although these persons were respectable and industrious enough, yet they were too peaceable in public matters to be good citizens, scarcely having been known to give their suffrage at an election for members of the Council, or if they had, the votes had been against the burgomaster in question, therefore, they were assuredly dangerous to society, and the sooner they were denounced and got rid of the better—and then withal, the boastful recreant, who hourly had jeered virtue among his abandoned fellows, and had cried out that he recked not, cared not for the amends an ill spent life demanded, who reviled God and man in his boldness, whose thoughts of after life were drowned in the enjoyment of the present, who mocked at honesty and despised innocence, with whom religion had been a jest and honour a blasphemy to pleasure, who founded his tenets on the saying of the King of Israel, “as the tree falleth, so it lieth—who knoweth the soul of the man goeth upwards, or the soul of the beast that goeth downwards?” he too began to feel an irksome load within his breast; his philosophy was weakened, and in vain he strived to rally it to his aid; he would have hid, but he knew not where. However, when these inquirers commingled with those who had thronged before them at the moat that encircled the fort, they found the gates closed, the drawbridge raised, the sarazine dropped, and sentinels posted on the walls, who most uncourteously seemed to deny both ingress and egress, and to the anxious seeking of the numerous questioners, were unwilling, or what appeared equally probable, were unable to return any satisfactory answers. The noise still continued: the hollow beat of the alarm drum at intervals, and the increased and unceasing tollings of the bell, sent their deep and mournful notes in the night air, that had before wafted its currents as peaceful as an infant slumbering on the bosom of its careful and tender nurse; the sounds rolled along the mountainous and rocky banks of the sterile shores of Weehawken, which trembled with the echo; the forest animal, who slept in the mazes of the woods that lined the declivities of Hobouk, leapt from his lair, awakened as by the startling shout of the pursuing huntsman, and as the long reverberations floated to the heights of Breukelin, those who dwelt in its sound looked abroad, and while the moonlight, with its fickle beam gleamed for an instant and broke through the cold clouds and fell on the bleak earth beneath, like the changeful smile of beauty, that seeks a face it loves, yet doubts to gaze upon, and rendered visible the black shadow of the stirring and distant city as they cast their eyes in wonderment towards it and hearkened to the echoes which seemed like the roaring of afar off thunder. And now the reader, if he has any curiosity thereto, arising from the effect which has been here described, or otherwise, on examining the section which immediately adjoins this, which is now fast concluding, will not remain long in doubt concerning the cause of all this dire distress, and in much less period of time than the crowd who had collected therefor received the same information. 5* SECTION II. “Whatt though these chaynes, these slavyshe manacles, Doe bynde my lymbes wytthyn theyre yrone foldes; Whatt, though I stande here a lyvynge mockerie Of thy tryumphe, dothe yt make thee my equale? No! were thys pryson a lordlie palace, Thys couche of strawe a canopiede throne; I were not then, though ttendede yn my pryde, More above thee yn soule, base hynde, than now.” The Ancyent Chronycle of the Proude Captyve. THE PRISONERS AND THE COUNCIL. “See that strict guard be had with the prisoners,” said a voice sternly at the entrance of the audience chamber, whose natural tone was elevated in command, if not swelled beyond its accustomed height by conscious authority; “and beware lest their bonds slip the tythe of an inch; an they stir or raise hand for flight, be ye not back with your steel or shot, nor fail to discharge your pieces home, so that their deadly contents seat in their vile hearts. Look to your charge I say, an ye love the house of Jacob Leisler, ye will not care to hew in atoms a dog of the name of Bayard.” As the person who spoke these words uttered them, he crossed the threshold and strode into the apartment. He was a man of slender and effeminate appearance, arrived at that middle era of human existence when the character becomes settled, the mind hath its full vigor, and the passions, whose violence deform, ambition and revenge, are lasting, quick, and pursuing, and do even engross the soul, a business of life more than at any other period. Youth starts like the wild horse; but having flashed forth its fiery qualities, grows calm; age runs cold; but it is manhood, when every resolution is long, during, and determinate. Nevertheless, from the first glance on the visage of this person; there was not that which gave strength of expression or would induce a belief that it was often moved from the apparent gentleness that always seemed to rest on it; but the first impression of the countenance of man is often deceptive, and this was one of those formations of congregated features that delights the superficial observer, and passes current with the world at large; a face, a vizard rather, enmasking deformity, such as is worn by the smooth hypocrite whose virtue is outward show, and who, by politic public charities, renders it hard if not impossible for him to be exposed in his true shape, which is only shown in his seizing every secret and private opportunity to put in force his meanness and crime. This man's complexion was fair, with heavy brows and knotted forehead; his hair was glossy, and at once tastefully and accurately divided in front, so that it fell in long thick curls to his neck; while a small line of beard, cut with the most exquisite skill, wavering on his upper lip, exhibited the neat trimmed mustachio, and it was in that feature, his swelling lip, that there lurked in its changeful curve a movement which elicited in part its owner's character, boastful and overbearing haughtiness and insolence of demeanour; and there was an evidence in his actions against him, for in spite of his hurried steps and the strong excitement by which he appeared agitated, there was an affectation of manner and a studied air with which he carried himself, that at once bespoke his self-opinion and consequence; the very art with which he threw from his shoulders his rich cloak, lined with Venetian velvet, and discovered a dress beneath fit for the gayest court gallant, having silk swashes with deep gold fringe at the end in his doublet, embroidered vest, and silver garters edged with lace, omitting none of the numerous knots, ruffles, tassels, and other fripperies, peculiar to the then reigning fashion, had something in it that laid bare to the observer the pride and superiority, which over those about him, he evidently claimed. No sooner had this personage placed his feet fairly in the room, than he was surrounded by its occupants, who eagerly striving by every means, to attract his attention, thrust on him question after question, each seeking to be heard first, and at the same moment, by the number and rapidity of their inquiries, giving him neither time or chance, if he so willed, to answer or even hear them—however, they might have all been satisfied by a few words, for all tended to one point, the cause of the hubbub without. He whom they addressed, nevertheless, noticed not their solicitations, but with a strong arm made way for himself through all obstructions, until he approached Leisler near enough to hold communication with him; and indeed the Governor in their alarm had met heretofore with little ceremony from his guests, for all respect had been forgotten to persons, every one having acted for himself, and pushed before his neighbour to the doorway; in their eagerness, jostling and elbowing each other without regard to consequence or dignity; the eyck meester having, in the conflict to get forward, rubbed most unceremoniously his lean sides against the fat ribs of the city goaler, a character and officer in those days as in this, of infinite magnitude, having risen from the office of burgomaster, for it was a salaried station, and such places in the city it is well known are never given to any person who is not in some way related, or is in propria persona a veritable member of the Corporation; and this official dignitary, who had together with the conducting of the whipping post, also that of the wooden horse and the gallows, in his anxiety had bolted on the rear of the receiver general of the revenue, who with his enormous weight nearly stove in the goodly round paunch that ornamented in advance the presence of a lordly and puissant echevin. In truth, all was rushing, struggling, tugging, treading on heels, and many sore pushings behindwards; every body being desirous of having a foot in front of his neighbour, as if such advantage would afford a moment's speedier knowledge, and losing more time, nathless, in the heat and labour of the contest than such satisfaction might have been attained. “Father, I bear you news that will make your heart leap like the blood in the veins of youth,” said the stranger, taking Leisler by the hand, “for be the other when it will, there never set sun on so prosperous an hour for our fortunes as but now it hath done.” “By myn trouwe, zon Yaakoop Milbourne?” inquired the Governor with a vacant stare; “what geschreeuw is dis, hey?” “For heaven's sake what is the matter?” broke out a dozen voices at one breath, each speaker unmindful of every thing but his own impatience. “Goot heer! sbeak, Mienheer Milbourne, ish myn huis mit vuer?” cried a rich burgher, whose soul was enwrapt in his possessions. “Mienheer, dell me vor der heer zakes, ish mien neger prokes on myn frauw, und der kind,” ejaculated another. “Der Fransch, der Indiaan, der neger, der vuer,” burst in one broken and distracting yell from the lips of the bystanders. “Give me your compassion, kind masters,” vainly strove Milbourne, forced to explain, “I lack but time to your bidding—hear me; there is—” “Oprizing of dem togs, der zlaaf,” interrupted one. “Der shitty, der stadt ish as vone prite vlame,” pursued another, in a note as dismal as an owl. “Den every podies mill hab his drote kut mit his oor,” echoed a third in a transport of despair. “For your own sakes, masters, let me but have the chance of a word,” cried Milbourne entreatingly, “I assure ye all there is nought ye should fear.” “Mien goot Got! is it zo?” quoth one. “Tish a wonderful ding den,” cried another. “Teer, mien hertz! who'd dort now,” continued a third, raising his hands in amazement. “Yes, masters,” pursued Milbourne, at length finding an opportunity to speak uninterrupted, “those doubtful bells should change their chime from alarm to rejoicing, for albeit, treason may have been busied near us— his disguise hath been torn to rags. Good father-in-law, your honour, and perhaps life, this night hath been preserved—a cur hath been found creeping unnoted towards us, whose lip was fraught with venom and with death— his taking were worth the jewels of Loretto.” “Mien hernel! Ik zoud guain zyne meening weeten,” responded Leisler, with a look that bespoke how little he comprehended the words of his son-in-law. Merciful Jaacob! Mienheers, don't worry the poor young man; he looks quite worn out;” here interposed dame Leisler, pushing herself towards Milbourne, and with tender solicitude raising her smelling bottle: “why he looks fainting, poor creature—dear, after your fatigue will you have some cowslip wine, or poppy water? Indeed this will—” “What is this alarm? tell us if you can,” impolitely interrupted those around; drowning the offers and anxiety of the dame in their vociferous inquiries. “I am not backwards in answering, for there is not cause;” said Milbourne, ` there are those in durance with us, whose name, howe'er it hath been a terror, shall be now no more than a jest; yes, the very tongue of dissension hath been plucked by its baleful roots. What think ye, friends, of Jacob Leisler and of the liberating revolution that on the British throne hath placed the glorious William? our bitter foes are chained captives in our hands—the Lord hath delivered our enemies up, bound hand and foot—the traitors, Nicholas Bayard and Walter Nichols, are both prisoners in this house.” The anouncement of an event so interesting and important to every inhabitant of the province, seemed to electrify the hearers: there were some who turned pale, as though stricken with the breath of the deadly fiery wind of the Scripture—the eyes of some roved around, sparkling with delight, seeking countenances that reflected an index of their own, which were brightened by gratified triumph and revenge—and there were some who incredulously shook their heads, and ventured to whisper doubtingly to those who were nearest, as though scarce induced to grant faith to that which they had heard —and there were still others, whose visages darkened and whose countenances fell like the black shade of the cypress tree at evening over a tomb—indeed, in that assemblage, although not many, being as heretofore shown, thinned of its numbers, there were but few men indifferent, and who were not affected by the intelligence; nevertheless, most were silent, nor gave voice to their thoughts, albeit here and there some retainer of the government and the Leisler family, some hired placeman, violent partizan or pensioner, attuned his throat to rejoicing, and shouted, as in duty bound joyous and lustily, and cries rang through the wide apartment from many a lip pliant to all occasions, and ready to bellow as loud for the conquered, had the victory been theirs. “Ik ver blyd 'er my over; Ik heb geluck!” quoth Leisler with eager rapture `dat is, Ik is vortunute, Hab mien gounshil been zend vor? zay, mien zon Yaakoop, zay, vor Ik ver blyd 'er my over.” The officers of the Council, sir, have all been duly summoned, and now await directions; therefore it is best that the room be cleared,” returned the person he addressed. “Regt! drue, das is drue,” said the Governor. “It is necessary that you depart, my masters, awhile,” said Milbourne to those who were pressing at his side, “seeing that it is not our custom, that in a period so rife with dangers as this, the passages of the Council should be spread abroad—meaning no hurt to you friends, who I doubt not are trusty and affectionate unto us; but ye cannot blame, when wisdom lies in secrecy, and safety follows caution—that a request be made that forthwith ye leave us; but ere ye go, bear with ye in your minds that we are grateful for your loves and kind adherence, and be no man loth to report among the worthy burghers of the city that Fort William contains their foes; it will doubtless be of pleasant savour to their hearing.” At this bidding, slowly and with lingering steps those who had no authority to remain departed, for however respectful the order to leave the place had been worded, still it was a direct order, and one neither, from circumstances attached to the person who gave it, to be disobeyed or questioned; the reluctance with which it was fulfilled, therefore, was plainly evident, for it had in one instant, destroyed expectant curiosity, it had put to flight, at a breath, the hopes of some and the greedy malignancy of others; and besides, the desire to learn what would be going forward in the Council was excited and increased by the knowledge of the fact that it was a secret proceeding—there were those who had set their hearts at gaining a sight of the prisoners and of their bearing, of hearing what would be their fate, and how other matters that might be broached would be settled; and there were those who had already planned all that was to take place and be said on every subject, and were only anxious to behold the confirmation of their work—to all these, quitting the objects on which their hearts were fairly set, was peculiarly hard; as severe as rending a sculptor from his favourite statue, the model of all he deemed perfect; the painter from his prize picture, or the dashing at one fell swoop to earth, the loved day dreams of the youthful enthusiast—on the females who had been present in particular, it had fallen harshly, and as they went, like Eve driven from the gates of Eden, they cast many a lingering look behind; yet in their disappointment they soon found consolation in determining, with the usual fervour of the sex, that they would still ere long taste the forbidden fruit; and true such resolves more than once had heretofore proved—for it was a most extraordinary thing how the acts of the legislators of the Nieuw Nederlandts were published as they were, almost as soon as formed: and although many a burgomaster, who was taciturn in his seat in the redschap, was put to his wit's end to avoid the queries of his helpmate, yet the next day, or even sooner, after deliberations charged as the most secret, they were in the mouths of every body —from the hay-scales to the baardschreeder's winkel,— yet there was no one who had been entrusted but what denied his having been faithless; and so it may well be supposed, that many a curtain lecture in the instance that is treated of was threatened, and among those of the most consequence was one in embryo in the bosom and fast swelling tongue of dame Leisler—who considered herself ill treated on all sides—first in the little deference that had been paid her by the company, and to her smelling bottle, cowslip wine, and poppy water, by her son-in-law—and lastly, in what appeared to her ideas of etiquette, her being fairly turned out of a room in her own house; but although in this last matter her passion raged loftily, she had made up her mind to the inconvenience, on reflecting that there was an excellent situation for listening in a neighbouring chamber, the key-hole of the door of which was of such advantageous dimensions, that necessarily all that was enacted must be overheard. All having retired except those whose presence was allowed by virtue of their offices, the chosen advisers of the ruler of the puissant colony of New Yorke, took their several places,—and to them Milbourne related more minutely in circumstance, that having suspicions that the morning's disturbance arose from interested instigators, who must have been in person sowing disaffection among the people, who had heretofore been submissive to Leisler's authority—by judicious stratagems he had been enabled to trace the steps of the two most inveterate foes of his family, unsuspected by them until too late;—in short, by a well devised operation, he had, assisted by his partisans, surrounded those discordant rousers of rebellion at a moment when they had expected they were in the full tide of success, and had arrested them with a warrant on a charge of high treason—they had been conducted as captives in a public and ignominious way from the house of one of their followers, and in their progress to the fort there had been a desperate though vain attempt for their rescue, and this last had caused the almost always tranquil city of Nieuw Amsterdam to have its peace disturbed in the manner heretofore set forth. As Milbourne concluded, exultation sat on the grim and gloomy faces of the Councillors. A brief silence followed; each seemed to wait, fearful to break the deadly pause, as if depending on an expression of the sentiments of another, to confirm the dark intentions of his own soul. “He hath said we were but dirt; not worth the trampling of his boot heel,” muttered Peiter De Lanoy, a leader of the Council, sternly compressing his lips as he spoke, “out on his pride; how will he do now when the dirt hath closed about his throat—an it may be he'll sink beneath it like one in the quicksands of the sea.” “He hath said the scum of the people have thrust themselves in all places of trust and power,” echoed another. “He hath called us hounds, not fit to lick his kitchen Vol. II. 6 trenchers—he hath loaded us, young and old, with contumely and scorn,” followed a venerable looking man, who was named Edsell, of Queens county. “Who but he opposed our march, and forced us to fight our road step after step? Who but he stirred up against us Dirk Wessels and Claes Ripse, and Schuyler, the Albanians? Hath he not hardened the proud Van Kortlandt against our overtures? Hath he not been like the leper's sore, that hath widened like a death mark among us?” cried Milbourne, who had watched his opportunity and now malignantly sought to increase the force of the gathering tempest: “but there is a change in the swift and smooth flowings of his fortunes; he is in our hands.' “Aye, the best blood that riots in his veins would not go far to repay the injuries he hath done our cause,” quoth Gerardus Beekman, of Kings county, his dark brows meeting in a threatening frown. “His blood! his blood! he would have taken ours an he could; but we hold him, so let him look to his head,” burst forth from several, who added determinate gestures to their words. A stern deep hum of assent and approbation ran from lip to lip. “Myn beszer vreints, I dink so; dou dink doo,” advised the governor himself, addressing his associates with a look of wise prudence and moderation, “By myne trouwe! derevor, I pelieves dat is goot, dis duegenuit dalk mit his taal vor hish drote vor ont hond wat Ik zeg; ven his drote is gut droo his kopt daar is geen helpen aan, op myne vord, I dink wat I zay.” “Let the prisoners be brought before us,” said several of the Council. “Ho! who waits there? drag the culprits to their judgment seat,” called out Milbourne passionately. There was a stirless and solemn silence for the space of a minute throughout the apartment,—at the sharp voice of Milbourne's imperious command, there was a sudden cessation of speaking even among such as were holding with their friends or coadjutors a secret consultation of what course was the most profitable to pursue in the momentous affair before them; as the captive's guard showed himself at the doorway and announced their coming, at once all discussion ceased, and so deep was the pause that one might have heard the wood worm's death watch in the oakened and pannelled wainscot. All looked anxiously and with dark and expectant visages towards that door; by and by, there came the heavy and harsh clank of chains, and the quick trampling, and clash of the footsteps of armed men; it came near, and both the captives having a hardy looking and whiskered soldier of the adelborsten at his side, armed and fully accoutered, with his long traphaan and his bandelier girded about him, were conducted before the Council of their foemen. The first was a tall, thin, sallow man, with a high pile of forehead, and large and prominent features; his head was somewhat bald and bare, yet the few locks that kept their place were of a dark hue untouched by years; his dress was very plain, indeed it might have been accounted mean for one of his lofty bearing, for though in the servitude of irons, his eagle eye glanced around with as haughty a gaze as a leader urging on the pursuit, and his tread was as stately and as firm as though in that hall he strode to meet the greetings of victory instead of the derision of his conquerors; his brow was faintly wrinkled, though his person was unbent and straight as a turret, so that he might have been compared to one of those ancient monuments, which time's half shadows half displays; —this was Bayard, the proud Bayard—close behind him stood the other, his companion in misfortune, of a younger look and prepossessing countenance, though scarce attracting the eye which was irresistibly fixed, from the moment of his entrance, on the unbowing figure at his side. “Nicholas Bayard and Walter Nichols,” said De Lanoy, “you are arraigned before this Council, composed of the chosen representatives of the province of New-Yorke, and the true supporters of the glorious revolution, charged with levying arms against the king, and that, instigated by a vile and wicked spirit of opposition, you have obstructed the faithful authorities and subjects of the realm from rendering their just allegiance to the protestant successor of the throne, and have withal, traitorously joined in rebellion against the people. What answers have you to make? Dare you, can you, sirs, disown these high crimes?” “Sirs, before your questions be satisfied,” replied Bayard, “I do demand at whose command, by what authorized power, nay, I would say, by what law, have you erected this pretended tribunal? where is your charter for it? and on what legal warrant am I detained here, in bonds fitted alone for the culprit robber, or murderer? Why, I say again, is a burgher, free and born among you, dragged felon-like, as guilty of some lawless crime, from the peaceful dwelling of his friends into this presence? Behold these ignominious chains, alike upon my comrade there;— Who is the man that dares thus violate the dearest privilege of life, liberty? I repeat it, sirs, by what right am I thus held?” “Do your words seek us in scorn, or is your demand serious, Nicholas Bayard?” inquired De Lanoy sternly. “Ye can take it, sirs, even as ye are most willing to use it,” responded the other in a firm though sneering tone. “Hear him; he despises us! hear him; he contemns our power!” cried several of the Council in anger. Milbourne started threateningly from his seat, “Down with his overweening pride. Nicholas Bayard, you do forget yourself,” said he in a voice of rage, “we are no more your slaves—bethink ye, haughty sir, whose manacles you wear.” “Speak to those who'll hear you, sir,” replied Bayard scoffingly, “for I am used to mate with my equals; not such as thou art.” “By all the pains of hell!” thundered the other, “I'll rip thy—” “Peace, brother Milbourne, peace! calm thine anger, however just,” quoth De Lanoy, restraining his upraised arm; “this doth offence unto the dignity of this sitting; let us pursue our duty with the prisoner.” “'Tis well, Nicholas Bayard, that you are a bondsman, or I had robbed the hangman of his office,” said Milbourne, as he resumed his place. Bayard smiled, but answered not a word. “Prisoners, you stand before the Lieutenant Governor of his Majesty's province of New Yorke,” continued De Lanoy, “aided by his sworn and tried Council; in the absence of the former constituted rulers, by commission from the lords Carmarthen,Halifax,and others, Jacob Leisler is empowered to take care for preserving the peace and for administering the laws, until our high and mighty sovereign, William of Orange, King of England, with further and other orders—” “I bow most humbly to thy swelling preamble of my judge's titles, Peiter DeLanoy,” returned Bayard ironically; yet with such sufficient command of features, that his feelings were scarcely discoverable. “But I am an ignorant man—therefore mayhap to enlighten me on my darkness of mind, the wise and potent counsellor who hath addressed me, will explain to me from whence his excellency derived his commission once again; albeit I am growing old—my ear may have deceived me; was it said commissioned Governor?” “Ah, Bayard!” said Milbourne quickly, “he did say commissioned—and what dare you say against it?” “Oh nothing—nothing,” replied Bayard carelessly, “when it is backed by a bravo's dagger.” “Sirs! is this insolence to be tolerated?” cried Milbourne, choaking with passion. “For shame Captain Milbourne! restrain this violence,” said De Lanoy temperately. “He has insulted one and all present—let him be remanded,” said several of the council speaking tumultuously at one breath. “Nay Sirs!” answered De Lanoy, “it were not well we should thus lose temper at his gibes—we are a calm, deliberating court and by this conduct the accused criminal doth but enlarge his guilt; yet, it is fit we should go on with his examination, keeping his own rash words as evidences against him—`for out of his mouth,' as it is said, `let his judgment come.' Prisoners, listen to what charges are preferred at you!” 6* “One word,” interrupted Bayard, “pardon for my stopping you. You have termed us prisoners—I do allow it—these irons speak the truth of such term; but ere you proceed, I repeat, that I will not answer to one sentence that you put to me, unless, as once before I intimated, you do solve to me your master's commission—which neither have I heard, nor do I believe exists;—and, what is more than all, I'll wage my right hand that no such hath been given by the king. To whatsoever legal dignity Jacob Leisler boasts, I will cheerfully submit; but to any self-assumed office, as a loyal subject, I cannot—nay, by the living heavens! I will not subscribe the least knowledge.” “I am struck dumb by his unparalleled impudence— who hath heard the like!” said the voice of the council, after a pause of astonishment. “Colonel Bayard, do you know you are throwing away life as it were a thing not worth keeping,” pursued De Lanoy. “He is a madman—give him to the tortures! the provost-marshal's thong will cool in short count his hot-headed pride,” quoth divers of the members in great wrath. “Nicholas Bayard, you and your companion have despised us,” outspoke Milbourne loudly, and rising in his seat with vehement gestures, “have questioned the stations we hold with a degree of scorn that becomes your other actions; and that, plain as the hand writing on the wall, hath shown your hearts. It were needless, as are the feelings of this tribunal of your judges, to go on and hear you defend, or trouble ourselves to prove your crimes—suffice it to say ere I give my vote, which you may well believe is for death on all traitors, that you well know that in this room there sits not a man who is not more than your equal. We are your peers, haughty Sir! and I would advise, an you desire to show sense, that you no more carry your head higher than it can well bear. Remember, Sir, an your loftiness can so far reflect, that the most soaring branch of the forest, is the most like to be swept to earth —and the hangman's cord hath tightened round a nobler neck than thine, Nicholas Bayard.” “Methinks I hear the busy anger and the puny hum of an insignificant and spiteful wasp,” exclaimed Bayard, calmly and proudly turning from Milbourne, “you see, Sirs, his sting is venomous; but I am not ruffled by an insect.” “By my soul's welfare!” roared the other, nearly bursting with uncontrollable rage, “but I'll rive that tongue of thine from its roots.” As he shouted these words he was about to rush upon the captive, but many of the Council arose from their places and withheld him, foaming with revenge and ire. “Mien vriends, 'tis to nien burbose dat dis mensch ish sbeak mit,” quoth the governor, “vor you zee zo as I zee dat he maaks mien zon Yakoop kill himzel mit hish gramschap; derevor tis regt dat you laat hem met vreede.” “Tis said true, that this cavilling doth ill become us,” responded De Lanoy, “and the prisoner doth provoke his own hurt.” “Nay, dost think I fear a thing such as him?” said Bayard with a smile of contempt, “let him alone—I am rather old and chained, but that's no matter—I do not tremble at him. Sirs, do not think I would descend to make myself so low as to bandy more words with such a tricked ape:—'sdeath! I should have fallen indeed were it so. I will not, therefore, seek his malice—though I despise it—I have nothing to do with him. But sirs, to you of this self-constituted council I speak now, for I do consider that by this my detention you do grievously offend against the acknowledged rights of an English subject; and mark you, knowing you have neither privilege for the outrage that in my person you have committed, nor the seal or signature of any one except your own besotted ambition for thus forming yourselves into a court of authorized powers, as ye wish to appear—I do caution you how you proceed in any further violence against my friend in durance and myself, so you may go through what forms, trickeries, and make-game of trial you please, I shall no more oppose you; and if you are bent on my blood I care not—take it, I will not flinch from the axe that you may guide against my head; deeming from my bold opposition to what in your pursuit of power I term treason, I have to expect little mercy from men who, to effect their unlawful purposes have openly and wantonly leagued with pirates and cut-throat robbers, and who are no better themselves than vile, disloyal traitors.” “Tis not worth our time to answer you; but from you we must not listen to another sentence,” said De Lanoy, “Secretary, read over the charges against Nicholas Bayard and William Nichols.” “Nicholas Bayard and William Nichols, hearken to me,” read Abraham Gouverneur, for such was the name of the governor's secretary, “you, Nicholas Bayard, it is here laid unto you, have vilely and with selfish cupidity sought and monopolized, in the late government of this province, every office of honour and profit; that you have avariciously and dishonestly used the emoluments of such places, and indeed the public monies that have passed in your hands, to enrich your own private purse, to maintain your relations and partizans, and have turned that very wealth so obtained against the colony; that you have, with those arch traitors Van Kortlandt, Schuyler, French, Wanham, Wessels, and others equally malignant, disturbed the peace of this his Majesty's province of New-Yorke, and have encouraged them, if not borne arms yourself against the established authority; and have acted otherwise in these matters most seditiously: in all of which enormities, you, William Nichols, have wantonly aided and abetted him; and for which you are now both in custody, under warrant of high treason. And unless you have withal to prove your innocence instantly, such is the dreadful state to which your rebellious plans have convulsed the province, that the council have commanded me to announce to you, that without further trial or inquiries they consider there is proof sufficient to condemn you to death:—how say you?” Both Bayard and his companion were silent, and returned not a motion in answer, but stood firm and composed. “I do not wonder at this conduct,” said De Lanoy, partly addressing the Council and partly the prisoners, “it is but natural for one of such an ambitious nature to act, even at such a moment as this, as he has ever borne himself; though loaded with guilt, though conscious of the people's indignation, he has a pride to tower amid crimes like the rebel angel. Speak Bayard, acknowledge that you have been alone guided by ambition and the most pitiful envy in your actions; for while you have been grinding the colony of its very marrow, revelling in the profits of the numerous offices you wrested by sycophancy and intrigue from more deserving men; while you held yourself above your fellow burghers with a pride insufferable, catering, spaniel-like, to the libidinous pleasures, that in their eyes you might have favour, of the licentious tyrants that a bigotted monarch had deputised to rule over us; hath not Jacob Leisler, our worthy compeer, and his friends, strove and laboured with the very strength of their bodies and their fortunes for the weal of the province; seeking at every moment of life to unlock the fetters such as you and yours were rivetting upon us? and we have done it; and urged by that wicked idea, that since you could not equal you would destroy, have you not afterwards gone on?—shame! was it not too late after the fight was ended, the victory won, for you to step forward and tell that your heart had been ever with the good cause; (why then not act?) but that you despised its leaders, because we were not of such descent as you considered the nobility of the land, the patentees of governors, the Livingstons, the Schuylers, the Rombouts, and such who had more pride and money than honour or honesty. Have you not, recreant, on such foundation for hatred, pursued the path of a false traitor? Have you not opposed the progress of the protestant revolution? Have you not scattered rebellion in every furrow you could lay open to receive it? Have you not now been taken in the very act for which you are arraigned? Answer—Have you and your abettors, such as this tool Nichols here, not done this and more than this I have accused you of, and plainly, from what motive,—to gratify disappointed pride; to thrust yourself in power for which you had neither claims nor desert.” “It were almost needless for me to say what you must perceive, that as well as Colonel Bayard, I neither recognize your powers here as a Court, nor do I deem it necessary to seek your mercy,” replied William Nichols, “therefore you but spend your breath, and may at once as well do your worst.” “They do not deny their guilt,” pursued De Lanoy, “your voices, sirs; shall we proceed to pass sentence of death upon the traitors?—Secretary, fill the warrant.” One or two members hesitated, but the majority of the Council bowed their heads at the words of De Lanoy in token of approbation: for a moment among all, there was a stern and solemn silence, unbroken except by the slight sound of the pen with which the Secretary was swiftly filling up the death warrant. The captives, with arms enfolded, unbent, unmoved, gazed without the quivering of a nerve upon the solemn preparation, in whose procedure their lives appeared so intimately concerned. At this important juncture, the door of the chamber was opened of a sudden, and an officer of the hoofdwagt stood in the entrance. “Whence is this intrusion, Sir,” exclaimed Milbourne angrily, “at a time when the Council are sitting with closed doors? How now, Sir?” “Pardon, good Sirs,” answered the officer, “I would not have presumed, but there are two without, an Indian and a boy, who urge to be introduced, being bearers as they say of intelligence, at once of moment, alarming, and important.” “Keep silence! for your tongue's too free;” ejaculated Milbourne, sternly: “Whatsoever it may be, they must wait. See you not, Sir, we are engaged—busied, I say— begone! though see they depart not till here we end.” The soldier however lingered, “How now, Sir, why do you stay? is there ought for you to do?” “These persons tell me, Sir, that the matter must be instantly known to the Governor, which they seek to communicate, and so momentous is it, they say, that unless instantly acted on, the cause may be destroyed and our enemies triumphant.” “Ha! what can this mean?” exclaimed many of the Council, “they had best be heard.” “Not until Bayard's death warrant is signed—sealed irrevocably!” cried Milbourne impetuously. “Zon, Yaakoop Milbourne,” said Leisler, “myn vreints zay dese mensch must sterven, dat is, die—I must zay zo. By myne trouwe dough, I dinks 'tis well to be kool in de matters, zo I dink de Indiaan and der jongen must inkoomen, und het most noodzaaklyk zoo zyn. “You may admit these importunate strangers,” said De Lanoy. The officer withdrew, but in a few seconds returned, accompanied by the Indian and the boy, who have before filled so conspicuous a part in this narrative. “Well, stripling, for the attainment of what object,” sought Milbourne, “at an hour so unseasonable, have you intruded on us?” “My business was with the Governor, and with him alone. I entered here not thinking to meet all these who set around me.” “Boy, this is but idle,” exclaimed De Lanoy impapatiently, “if your reports are of a nature that interests the public welfare, to one and all here it should be known without evasion; if it is, after all, but some private communication, you have done wrong—you have highly trespassed on our patience, and richly deserve punishment for your audacity in thus thrusting yourself and follower on us at a time when we were debating on life and death.” “On life and death?” repeated the boy in a voice thrilling and anxious, and directing his eyes on the prisoners, “then I have come in time. I see it now,—forbear, I do forbid you to imbrue your hands in the blood of those men who stand manacled before you; touch not a hair of their heads draw not an angry sword against them; for your own safety forbear them; harm them not as you wish for life yourselves.” “Rash youth! how dost thou dare—what hath sent thee here?” exclaimed De Lanoy in amazement. “How hath this thing of idiocy been allowed to come within this presence?” ejaculated Milbourne. “The prisoners should have been withdrawn, nor have met the sight of this strange madman,” echoed another. “Nay, friends of Jacob Leisler, think me not mad, nor look on me as a foe, for there is not among you one who loveth in his heart you aged man, whom you have dressed in robes of power, like unto me, and soon ye will know it,” said the boy, “for even in what I now advise, that the lives of Bayard and his associate be spared; I speak for the good of all—hear what I have to say, then judge me—but first let your prisoners be withdrawn, for what I have to tell is not as yet for their hearing.” “The ragged losel speaks far above his condition,” said De Lanoy, “shall it be granted, Sirs?” A consent to their being removed having been obtained, Bayard and Nichols were conducted out of hearing. “Now you have your wish,” said Milbourne hastily, after the departure of the prisoners, “be quick and explicit in what you have to say, and see it be of consequence, that you would fain have it, for the doings of men are not put off, nor their resolutions tampered with, unpunished. So at once let us know all you have to inform this Council of—speak boy!” “Angerous sir, did not my kindness for your father outweigh the insults of your unmannered haste,” returned the youth calmly, “I might be tempted to remain in silence, nor give a satisfaction to what you seek; but though from you I lack encouragement, yet I want not care for others who are here, and therefore intend not to keep secret my knowledge. Sirs, it is well ye learn that last night there landed on this island an officer from England, deputed by the king as governor of this province —supplied with all necessary powers, papers and authorities, to rule the people of this distracted colony.” It would be difficult to describe the varied feelings of those present at this information. Astonishment, doubt, fear and dread were depicted in every visage. Some started from their seats, not knowing what they were doing—others fell back on their settles, pale and amazed— the eyes of all were on the boy. “Can this be certain,” inquired one at length. “I swear most true; as heaven is my judge I speak not false,” answered the stripling, “and here is one— this Indian, who can confirm what I have told to you.” “And who are you,” questioned Milbourne at the savage. “I am one who, like a lingering ember of the council fire, lives through loving not life after my race hath expired,” replied the red man in a voice of sorrow, low and mournful, “I am one who, like the last stalk that remains in the field after the tempest is past, hath no joy that it is spared, to be a lonely emblem of desolation. The grave I seek will soon be my habitation, for with grief hath the strength of my arm grown to decay, and I feel my feet will no more serve me in the chace—yet I know the truth of the brave youth who hath spoken with you of the Corlear.[10] [10] This name was given by the savages from respect to the governors of the province of New-Yorke, from a person so called, who was drowned in Lake Champlain. Brothers, the White Skinned Beaver tells not a lie, his lips have ever been white with truth.” “This is most strange intelligence—have none heard of this before?” sought De Lanoy. “In coming hither it had almost slipt my memory, so little credence gave I to the story,” said one of the counsellors; “there was placed in my hand, in a most soiled and wretched state, a paper: an epistle purporting to be from one who styles himself Tribulation Wholesome, and signifies himself as my protestant friend and well wisher, who states, that last night, towards the city he journeyed in company with one who he has reason to believe was a person of consequence, albeit a man from beyond sea. In his language he calls him a `crowned Saul, anointed to rule over our Israel.' Deeming it the effusion of some busy madman—though lucre, for what in his opinion seems most valuable information, appears to be his object, I scarce perused it; but its contents have returned upon my mind in confirmation of what is now told us. Natheless at its reception I was fain to pass it, unable to fathom its sense or bearing.” Vol. II. 7 “An this be as is said, there will be clouds above us,” said one. “Clouds! rather say a tempest hath begun which will sing our dirge,” exclaimed another. “The hounds upon our coast must have grown weary of the scent of blood,” muttered a third. “Or who knows but the other party may have paid heaviest, and promised more than we have,” whispered a fourth, “robber, pirate, devil, all he thinks or seeks for is gold, gold.—What is to be done?” “Sirs, ye seem struck with amaze,” cried Milbourne impatiently, “what matters all this; shall it save Bayard? have we not voted his death—shall he not die?” “We should be cautious, Captain Milbourne, in what we do,” quoth one or two of the council. “As we have not notice of this new governor's coming may it not be that he is favourable to Bayard and his friends,” joined others. “We must do nothing rash, it is not safe nor prudent; nay, it becomes us to do nothing rash,” echoed many of the members. “By heaven, sirs! this would wreck the patience of virtue itself,” cried Milbourne, rising exasperated from his settle, “what means this change among you? Do I hear you aright? are you men of soul and heart, or are you like the craven, who boasts that he fears not dangers —but when they confront him he trembling hides his recreant head? What hath wrought this change among you? Admit the truth of what these persons tell us— what doth it avail to us? Are ye heart stricken at the step of a man of whose authority we yet know nothing? How if these here, who have so busied themselves, are hired by our enemies to hatch this tale? What, are you palsied—are you stricken to slaves at the sound of an approach of a tyrant—are you ready to throw down your freedom, and like the timorous spaniel crouch at your master's feet before you see him? Is it this we have toiled and laboured for—at an alarm to surrender at discretion all our rights? On my soul ye are a noble set, startled by a shadow—slain by a trumpet blast—conquered by the description of a lance! It frets me to hear and see you act thus:—have you no firmness—no resolution to dare and die—no spirit except such as actuates a wanton child, who after his mischief eager snaps at the first moment of repentance? If it be true that King William hath been so far misled, either by our enemies or by the false faith of our envoy, Jost Stoll, to bestow the government of this province on other than my father, ungratefully forgetting his services towards the success of the revolution to which he owes his throne—I say for one, let us be well assured of our own safety—our lives—our dearest liberties, ere we tamely deliver up our present power and sovereignty; if we have been dealt unfairly by, we can guard ourselves from further wrong—and we have about us, in arms and means, enough to show those who wish us ill, that we are able to bid them to their teeth defiance. And to show the firmness of our intentions, let the bloody heads of those two attainted and condemned traitors be placed at once upon the ramparts towards the city, so that their partizans may learn that every step they take against our established rule, is with the executioner's axe ready at their seditious throats.” “Jacob Milbourne, I must speak for my own part, and I may, I am assured, say, for that of most here present,” said Edsell, shaking with age as he spoke, “there is none of us who are wont to depart from the cause we pledge ourselves to support, nor do I think such is the intention now, and yet, under all circumstances, I have given it more thought, I cannot assent to the death of these men; nay frown not, nor look on me with flashing eye—you are a younger man than I am, you want experience, Sir, the world is not learnt in a day; my head is white, quite white, I lack a year of fourscore, and you see I tremble, but mark, I affirm it, it is neither for fear of your haughty looks or living man; but age—age, Sir, hath a wondrous knack at unsettling a man's steadiness of limbs; still it gives what want of years hath not, prudence, Sir, and mayhap wisdom. I repeat it, I do not consider it proper at this time to put in force our late determination with respect to Nicholas Bayard and Walter Nichols.” “And I answer you, passing your touches on youth and inexperience, which is a chorus worn out by sly old dotards to conceal their duplicity,” replied Milbourne fiercely striking his hand upon the haft of his rapier; “Albeit, youth be hot, stirring, and headstrong, age is more in its cool reflection akin to rank cowardice—I do proclaim it, nor will I recall the word, that he that backs not the late decision, he that gainsays the resolve of Bayard and Nichols' execution, is not more than a lukewarm friend, or rather a rank foe to the cause and the house of Jacob Leisler, and as well deserves to grace the provost marshal's rope as the worst rebel that hath plotted with Van Kortlandt against us; and now you have heard my thoughts, where is the man that likes them not?” The Council rose from their seats. “If we are to be browbeat into opinions, we had better dissolve,” said one. “If we are to have our voices forced from us by threats, we may as well depart at once,” exclaimed another. “The oldest man among us to be treated so? we had as well be ruled by Bayard,” added several. “Our master's wish is to be crammed down our throats —we are to have no will,” followed others. “For the love of Heaven, Sirs; for our own sakes, Milbourne, Edsell, hear me, Sirs, hear me,” interposed De Lanoy, “what are you about? will you destroy yourselves? Will you, like the Eastern bird, suck your own blood? What are you about to do? Anger is of a moment's birth, but of years in life—this is wild, wild! Do not for this idle bickering sacrifice the dearest interests of us all. Edsell, you know Milbourne is quick and taketh fire like the dried leaves of the last winter—Milbourne, though you may suppose wrong hath been, there is something due to age. Do not act like madmen; this is a time you should forget all fueds; a time when things like this should be far from our assemblage. If it be so that an armed enemy approaches from without, is it politic that within our walls we raise sharp weapons against our own bosoms, and give, by our own hands, victory without the levelling of an adverse spear.” “Mien vreints, dis iz pad; dis dosh kreib mien zeil do hish gore, by myne trouwe,” entreated the governor, “Myne zon, Yaakoop Milbourne, mien regt hand is gut, mien vreint, Edsell, be gool; mien vreints, I ish gilt mit dis und't staat in u lieder magt me te behouden.” Although both Leisler and De Lanoy anxiously exerted themselves to soothe the wounded feelings of the exasperated assembly, and heal the breach which had so imprudently been made by the fiery and unreflecting Milbourne, it was some time ere matters were adjusted, so that the members resumed their places: and even then in most bosoms there had come a change of heart towards their leader. Like a drop of spreading and virulent poison in the wholesome liquor of the goblet, had been the words that had dropt from the disputants' lips; and, unmindful of every consequence, actuated by the fiery torch that lighted their breasts, they gazed at each other with scornful eyes; and the sharp look of contempt and hate alternately moved their swelling features: indeed, the hearts of many were weaned from the cause they might have heretofore ardently espoused—the blade was unsheathed, the deadly and parting blow had been given, and low, dark whispers passed between Edsell and his friends; and besides, there were some, on whom the conduct of Milbourne had no impression, and these were by far of the greatest number present, who sat as friends of Leisler for the last time, although now their hearts, (if they had such things,) were harassed by hopes and fears, waiting but for a certainty of the intelligence that had been communicated, to fly the party which they now, in their interested calculations, deemed must inevitably fall; and among these were many who had been nothing but for Leisler; who, from the base dunghills of their birth, had warmed themselves to influence in his smiles; yea, those, as in the like cases, on whom the greatest favours had been heaped—who had really sworn to live and die by the fortunes of their patron, with faith and oath as light as the dip of the rower's oar, striking the water, fickle as lovers' anger, and as quickly forgot,— were the first to plan his destruction, and the first to prepare 7* to desert him in his adversity, even before that adversity was fairly at his side, with her lean and iron hand to pull him to the earth. Yet it must be said, there were some, (though these were few,) who if not grateful for former protection, felt that their chance hung on the faction to which they had attached themselves; for so zealous had been their faith, that little mercy was for them to be looked for, should their opponents succeed: and with the resolute ambition of the condemned criminal, who, at the scaffold's brink puts on the look of unconcern and courage, unwinking of eye and untrembling in step, ambitious even in wrong—they were firm and resolved in purpose to brave the worst, in very despair. In a short time, the attention of the Council was again engrossed with the Indian and his youthful companion. “Stripling,” inquired Beekman of the boy, “were you aware of what consequence was this that you have told us? For what reason have you made yourself so officious and interested in this business? Have you been stimulated by an expectancy of reward?—or beware how you attune your young lip to falsehood!—have you lent yourself to forward the designs of others?” Hast thou wantonly lied, child, confess;” fiercely spoke Milbourne, “for an thou deceivest on this matter, by my soul, thy shrift shall be short, and thy gallows as high a one as ever stood on the commons.” “It were better for thee, youngster, an thou hast been employed by the adherents of the unfortunate and condemned men who have been remanded hence at thy coming, under sentence of death, by this as a stratagem to save them, that thou tellest true; for thou hast put thyself within the serpent's den, and if it prove not as thou hast said, albeit, thy life hast thou thrown away, as it were, a pebble, worthless, and to be picked from the ground as soon as cast there,” sternly added De Lanoy. “Thou seed of ill! who art thou? As I do look upon thee, there is something that striketh me I have beheld thee, ere now;—where has it been?” cried Milbourne again, suddenly and abruptly speaking before the boy could answer the questions that had been asked of him, at the same time approaching close to him, and strongly grasping his shoulder,—“by the life of me, thou seemest like one I should know, yet I doubt; though sooth wert thou an angel that hast stepped between Bayard and destruction, it shall not save him.” “White man, the claw of the panther is too heavy for the neck of the gentle fawn,” exclaimed the savage, as he struck the arm of Milbourne roughly from its hold on the youth. “If you love the blood that sports round thy heart, harm not the brave youth by thy touch of anger; for did Quider[11] [11] The name given to Major Schuyler of Albany, instead of Peter, which they could not pronounce. Speaking of Schuyler, Smith says, “he had so great an influence over them (the savages,) that whatever he recommended or disapproved had the force of a law; this power over them was supported, as it had been obtained, by repeated offices of kindness.”—History New-York, page 110. himself lay the weight of the wild bird feather on him, and the White Skinned Beaver was at hand, he would put the chain of friendship with the nation in the ground forever, and his tomahawk should drink his life as greedy as the wolf laps the waters of the spring.” “What, would the Indian dog slay me?” ejaculated Milbourne, retreating in surprise. “Why,—ho!—who stands on guard? As Milbourne uttered these words with something like alarm in his motion, he repeated his call in summons to the attendants who might be in waiting without the apartment, to secure this unexpected and determined adversary, lest his dangerous threat should be put in force. The youth, however, interposed in favour of his wild and dauntless friend. “Be not in such haste, Jacob Milbourne,” said he, “thou hast started without cause; there is no need of fear nor of the presence of a myrmidon at thy side, to lend thee an arm's defence. I trust from us thou shalt have no harm; in sooth, I have been most ready to accord to thy seeking all that I were able; albeit, rude forms and ruder words are not wont to obtain speedy answers.” “On my soul, youngster, methinks thou carriest a most lofty guise that doth belie thy ragged jerkin,” said De Lanoy, regarding the stripling with a look of wonder and inquiry, “either thou hast little deference for the presence thou art in, or, as your language,—your looks declare, and as before I shrewdly have suspected, thou art other than thou seemest.—Speak, sir, without prevarication, for such here shall not serve your design—who are you, and why thus disguised? We are not to be played with; be brief, and let us know your meaning?” “Ja! mien mensch—dat's mien goot klein mensch sbeak,” eagerly added Leisler himself, who for some time had been gazing on the boy with evident and increasing emotion, and was apparently moved by a doubtful and uncertain interest, attracted by the familiar looks of the object of his observation. He anxiously leaned forward to catch the reply, and to scan more minutely, the features of the stripling. “Mien zeil! I ish in der groot berblexidy: I ish in twyfel staan; dou sdardles mien hertz mit dien stem, dien vace, mien got, nien! het is niet zo. Om God's wille sbeak mien klein mensch.” “It is not in vain sirs, that you have called on me to unfold the character I bear,” replied the boy; “for with you it seems most questionable; yet you that thus seek at me have stood even in your own light, for had the chance heretofore been free, I had not been backward in my relation—howbeit, the words have swelled unto my lips from the moment of my entrance, and I do confess, so eager have I been, that my heart yearned against the suppression that my utterance hath received; nor do I now refuse to answer you; for I am one of all that wanton fortune hath ever frowned on most to meet your commiseration. You look on me in wonder; your eyes gaze with strange glances upon me, as though even on the onset you would doubt that which I would tell. Yet believe me, though thus young of years, smooth of brow, and tender of form, my short life hath been too poor a sacrifice to appease with its unceasing misery the inveterate malice of unrelenting misfortune. He that liveth on in sorrow without change, forgets the name of happiness, becomes inured—yea, gloats in pleasure in his wretchedness, and finds enjoyment in his melancholy course of tears—another state to such who never counted on it, were to lose an accustomed companion; for the death and danger that had clogged his weary steps had engrafted with existence. But he who plunged in trouble, hath his soul ever wrapt in hope, builds on the hour of his release, and with pleased imagination, feasts on the expected presence of the happiness to come; —whose only shadow brings more joy than all the substance of the world besides. And then think ye of his wild despair, when he hath toiled unto the gates of his high-wrought paradise, and sees them shut, even at the moment he prepares to enter. His hope of day is gone; night, irremediable night is on him—the chord on which his being hung is snapt in twain:—like the mother, who inconsolable, hath raised the death song over the carved gravestone of her first born, all that he doted on hath departed forever. Nay, sirs, you bend dark brows upon me, and your lips mutter with impatience: bear with me but awhile, for this is not an idle allegory to dally with your time —hear my tale, then judge me:—for a few brief months have scarcely flitted away unto the devouring bosom of the past, since bliss and pleasure was my portion—bliss, rather such as is the envied lot of those who dwell in Elysian bowers, than the chance of persecuted humanity; (what can exceed?) wealth and luxury were mine, fond and anxious parents, and troops of admiring friends surrounded my course of life, like the gay clouds, that tinged with ethereal glory, hang in many coloured masses about the path of the day god. But this hath not lasted; it is gone by and left its memory alone, faint, though beautiful as marble, seen but by the moonlight ray. Fate so appointed, that to perfect the interest of my family, I left my home, to seek beyond the dark and dangerous seas, a ruling clime to which that of my birth was tributary. I left my home, and returned, but worn and wasted by the passages through which I had gone. Think then of my misery, when having escaped the most fearful and unheard of dangers, the repetition of which alone would freeze the blood, I stood within the hall where I parted from my family's arms, glowing with affection; albeit, in that very hall and presence I was unknown, unrecognised, a stranger unmeet for greetings of love.” “Mien Got! mien groot got!” cried Leisler, starting in great agitation from his seat; “ish mien eysh regt, —does ik zee regt—mien kind!—mien schildt!—mien zon!” During the time that the youth had been speaking, the stout frame of the Governor shook with emotion; now he passed his trembling hands across his brows as if to awaken recollection, while his quick and eager sight read with fast recognition through the changes that hardship had wrought on the well known countenance of the stripling; and now he drew back irresolute, for doubt at times usurped, for could he believe that squalid garb robed the frame of his favourite offspring? could he trace in those hollow and wan features darkened by the exposures to wind and sun, the white and tender lily of his garden? that voice so sweet, so thrilling, like the notes of wanton birds carolling as they swim in the summer's downy atmosphere, had changed to a tone deeper and manlier than he had been accustomed to hear it; and in truth but few, in that feeble and emaciated child, a sapling, in its green and growing years, over which the hurricane had went in anger, could have remembered the gay and sportive boy, whose eye shone in pleasantry, and whose cheek glowed with health; indeed suffering and toil had worked such difference in both form and face, that it would have taken time, yea, for the mother that had borne him, to have known the altered features of her child; but ere he had heard him through, with outstretched arms and panting heart, Leisler rushed forward from the place where he had been seated— “Father! dear father!” cried the boy, and parent and child tottered in each other's arms. “Mien Arnyte! mien kind! van ieder be minde,” said Leisler, folding the youth in a long and close embrace, “mien vlower von mien hertz! Art dou here in mien arm? laat my zee in dien sveed vace, mien schildt.” “Dear father! this is payment for all I have suffered; your heart beats against mine—you did not forget your son.” “Vorgets! mient Got! vorgets dee? nien, nien, Arnyte; buts Ik did nien dink to zee dee, and dou beest altered in dien vace, mien kind. Vorget! I weenen,— mien tears comsh vrom mien ogten at dien ward vorget— Arnyte, dou makes de vrouw mit mien ogten.” “Good parent,” said the stripling, pressing Leisler's hand to his bosom, “pardon my idle, foolish, weak disguise; let it not give thee pain. That which I have borne from others had made me act the child even with thee; think not of it—I am you know as yet but a mere thoughtless boy—I would not grieve thee for a moment, or drive the slightest thorn into thy breast, so help me heaven, to save my limbs from rack. Father, thy tears are hot upon my forehead; let me kneel, and at thy feet do penance for my rude, ungenerous conduct.” “Op zyne knien, mien kind; nien, nien, mien arm shall geeb dee virst at mien hertz.” And again and again the parent and the child were held and entwined in each other's arms, and it was long ere the unbounded raptures of this unexpected meeting had subsided, so that the bystanders could interfere with their gratulations, which, though many times sincere and at least well meant from all, were but cold formalities to the overflowing joy of Leisler and his son, who, for a considerable time after their very strength had become exhausted by their embraces, gazed with eyes sparkling and swimming in tears on each other, and their hands clasped together, scarce heeding aught around them; nor did their full hearts find relief until both had wept like infants: however, after some time their minds became more composed, and the boy was addressed by others who were present. “I am glad, right glad, to see thee, brother-in-law, Arnyte,” quoth Milbourne, “howbeit, somewhat surprised, for we had deemed thee now at Whitehall, furthering with the new king our father's interest, though having not heard from or of you, since first you sailed on such important embassy; albeit, as I have always said, unmeet for one so young—there were those who went far to whisper a suspicion that you had as little care for the cause as it was thought of ensign Jost Stoll who was sent out before you, and who spent his time, instead of intriguing at Hampton Court, among the rank pannels and canvass of daubing limners.” “Ever rude, ever unkind and harsh,” retorted Arnyte upraidingly “was it well to taunt me with such unfounded accusations, which have their rise alone in your own jealous and fretful brain, Jacob Milbourne;—at a time like this too? for shame! and still I thank you, for I will at once to all here relate that which hath befel me, and show that the business on which I was dispatched was hindered me by the hand of fate alone; for although the vessel in which I embarked, at first rode the cleaving tide proud and safely as a warrior bestrides his noble charger, yet we had scarce left the coast behind, ere the face of the treacherous and smiling ocean changed, and soon a dreadful tempest drove our bark to pieces and whelmed all the life that had peopled its ribbed frame, except myself, within the yawning deep; a scatterling of the wreck to which, in my despair, I clung, bore at the mercy of the destructive element my frame, until, almost but for this restoration, I would say better had I perished than to be so reserved, from the waters I was rescued by the rude hand of a barbarous corsair—in his bondage have I lived, for having learnt my real name and rank, he considered me a valuable hostage for the protection of his flag, and in his hands I have endured to the full extent all that life could bear: blows, wounds have I received, and performed for savage murderers the most menial offices; the more cruel was the tasker's usage, as they believed me harmless, wanting the most useful faculties of life, while with hopes of escape, I encouraged their mistake, and of such loss, when taken from the sea, my dreadful and speechless state had given them a proof. I cannot tell all that I have suffered: under the Indian sun, the midnight storm, the tornado of other climes, suffice, I have dragged through all and yet am here. Late the marauders' route of plunder bent towards this, my own country, and last night, on a secret enterprise, a select party landed from their floating den of blood and crime; I was taken with them—at the destined spot, the accustomed haunt of Kid upon this island, this noble forester, journeying, as I understand, after having slain a vile and deadly foe, towards the river, craved the pirate's shelter; expecting no hindrance in their purposes from one of his appearance it was not denied—the object of the landing was known to all the band, and relying on their error as to my situation, they freely discussed their horrid intentions before me, and I learned that a king's messenger, bearing despatches to this province, with orders known to be destructive to the prosperity of the freebooters and their upholders, had been early in the twilight set ashore at Harleam, from a vessel that had arrived from England and lay off the sound. By a planned stratagem, a person in their interest guided the officer to the murderous hands of the desperado, and whilst they were busied about his capture, I found my Indian friend here was willing to assist me if the opportunity offered for escape.” “But this man! this messenger! speak! what of him? what became of him?” hastily interrupted De Lanoy. “From an incautious companion the rover had cause to suspect him a person of some standing, and therefore determined not to wet his steel with his blood, but to bear him to some wild and desolate key in the Caribbean Ocean, and there leave him to perish with a cruise of water and a day's subsistence; for so the robber argued, that as long as the life of a powerful man was not directly taken by him, he should have little to count for, if it should chance that justice should o'ertake him in his wicked path. But Providence, through my weak means, had ordered against the freebooter's designs, and ere they searched him I managed to wile from his mistrustful charge the documents the officer carried, and kept them safe for him; while his disappointed captors urged against him every brutal cruelty in their rage. And to convince you that his rank was such as I have said, and which the bandit had supposed, and that for my father's sake it was well he was preserved, while in my possession a document loosened by accident from the package, and was so forced on my observation: it contained directions of a private nature from the Prime Minister of England to the bearer, who was addressed by the name and title of Colonel Henry Sloughter, Governor of his Majesty's Province of New-Yorke, in North America, and therein he Vol. II. 8 was requested on his arrival in this colony, to proceed secretly and forthwith to the residence of Nicholas Bayard, who was termed their Majesties' worthy and loyal subject, and to consult with him on the surest method of calming the disturbed and distracted province, and bringing peace to all parties” “What, peace! he, Bayard, bring peace in the colony —ay, it would be such peace as wolves keep with lambs —signed in the best blood of his opposers,” cried Milbourne furiously. “Are you sure the paper was as you relate, Arnyte Leisler,” sought many of the council. “I am not deceived in its purport, and am confirmed by the conduct of Colonel Sloughter after our release from the murderous grasp of Kid, that—” “Then he has escaped clear, unhurt from the rover's ball and steel—safe did you say,” inquired De Lanoy. “Thus far, Peiter De Lanoy, I am assured—that the credentials of Colonel Henry Sloughter, as Governor of this province of New-Yorke, were publicly announced and acknowledged by the adherents and followers of the Bayard party, more than an hour past, and Governor Sloughter himself hath placed his head quarters at Bayard's Bouwerie for the present.” “And this man, this Sloughter,” pursued De Lanoy, “hath by you slipped through the nets that Kid wove for him:—rash hairbrained boy, what have you done,— by heaven, by your means we are destroyed, utterly destroyed.” “If thou believest, urged by a vexed and thwarted spirit,” returned Arnyte, firmly, “that I, Peiter De Lanoy, in lending my feeble aid to providence in the rescue of Colonel Sloughter from those bloody and cruel men in whose chains we both were suffering, have acted wrong and unwise—I answer, that though foolish, I may have done, ill, I have not—for if situated as we were, there is a human being who would have taken another course in existence, then let him declare it. It is well my breast holds not a kindred with such, for an I thought it did, I would tear this casement of flesh apart, anddrag the foul secret forth, that it might meet the spurning tread of all men—that the stony heart might wither in the dust, nor disgrace the tenement that had held it.—I am young, and may to the cold statesman's ear talk wild; and in his selfish calculations, that in which I have been an instrument of heaven's mercy, I may be deemed to have been most indiscreet: be it so—my own conscience doth acquit me of all evil; and yet I judge, that even on the score of policy, the preservation of Colonel Sloughter's life by me were not of such little moment, or of bad augury,—for can he that was saved from the assassin's thirsty knife, by the son of Liesler detest or seek to injure, although so tried by enemies, the parent of his deliverer. Yet, be it as it will, let the worst come—the dripping axe of the headsman, and the bloody block of the scaffold for us all—wantonly I would not dip my hands in human blood; for had I tamely stood by, having the power to preserve, I were not better than the murderer —yet as it is, Sirs, hear me, though I know you may say and think that I speak bold and forward for one so brief of years, so young as I am,—yet believe me, (and pardon my warmth, for your words wound me deeply,) I have the soul, though as you know, in other matters, a weak and childish one—still in this, to bear all the malevolence of fortune and wordly affliction, yea, very racks and tortures, beyond life's endurance, rather than aid by my forbearance, as ye do seem to have desired,—a crime so vile and rank, accursed by man and God—and this I speak for truth.” When Arnyte finished speaking, there was a short pause. “To waste time thus, in a contention of words, helps not;” spoke out with petulent haste, one of the council. “What has happened cannot be now reversed;—this we know, that a person has landed and is among us, claiming the authority of a ruler from the king. Its certainty is not for us to dispute, I fear: therefore if we mean to act, it doth straitway become us to prepare therefor— what is to be done ought to be proceeded on without delay. I demand your opinions, sirs;—what say ye should be our course?” There was for awhile a deep and momentous silence, each one awaiting, anxious and breathless, to hear what would be said by the others, and fearful and hesitating to be the first to break the doubtful and somewhat awful stillness that reigned in the council, or become a leader in any measure which the importance of the occasion demanded. It were a study of the worldly nature of man to have viewed the countenances of that assemblage, whose feelings were painted thereon, to the accurate observer, as strongly as the reflective mirror exhibits the very self of the person who gazes into its smooth and glittering visage. Here was the vacillating spirit, ready to change, and quick to steer any course pointed out at the instant, seeking with inquiring eye, the face of some prudent leader, whose tract its owner had been accustomed to follow:— and here were the deep brows drawn in contact, and the hard and obstinate features set in unbending form, of such as had determined their own course, let that come which would; and who only refrained from breaking forth at once, that they might be the more confirmed in the right of their own minds, from the opposition of others: and there were some, whose curled and scornful lips, and sneering look, as they glanced at the disturbed countenances around, bespoke their impatience of many, and the malignity with which they viewed and were set to receive, all that came from those to whom they felt disaffected; and, lastly, among all these there were those (and of these there were but few) upon whose calm collected fronts, like on a smooth pillar of marble, there was no sign or mark to read that which passed within— these were such whom long career of days had robbed of all outward appearance of passion—whom experience had taught command of every index of their thoughts, and who, cold and prudent, uninterested in all except themselves, patiently awaited that which should come, cautious, and without betrayal of their sentiments—it was, in truth, an interesting and agitated interval. “Will it please ye, Sirs, for me to deliver that which I have thought to advise,” at length said Samuel Edsell, rising from his place slowly, after having waited sometime, and resting his wrinkled band on the back of his seat as if to support more firmly his aged and trembling frame, and then looking on the faces of those about him as if at once to read in their returning glances their assent and accordance of sentiments to his own, and in a strong tone, which, however, from the falling in of his lips, and the loss of the teeth by age that had supported them, gave to his words a peculiar and whispering enunciation, he pursued: “I have lived too long in this world, and seen too much of its vanities and changes, as you may all well know, to make up my mind and give that which I hold as my opinion rashly and unreflected on, or for the sake of hearing that which others may have to say, better that I may quit the ground that I had taken—having only advanced my word that I might snap at another's—but let that pass; that the advance which I shall make may not suit either the temper of some or even the judgment of all here present, I am somewhat aware—I may be wrong, for we are all liable to errors, yet it is natural, though it may be ill of me to say so, that one who hath experienced something, and hath much at stake, honour, fortune, and family, should be less prone to advise or be ready to lead an evil way than such as are foreign in birth and but blustering adventurers among us, who have nothing but their blood to part with, which were not worth the draining— nay, interrupt me not; no person here can be harmed by my remarks: all know I mean no disrespect to any honourable member who hath a place with us—nay, I will say it was but a passing observation—well, no matter, let it go for nought, my intention was to show how much I held the interest of the province at heart—and that were needless for me to repeat here, where those who are my friends are assembled. In this province have I lived since birth; I am a yeoman of Queen's county, and so was my father before me—he was one of the first settlers, and his bones are laid there, God assoilzie him, and I hope that this withered body of mine may rot in this my native land, without a curse from my posterity; leaving them an honest name, such as my ancestors have left to me—beshrew me, ye may well suppose I wish not to court disgrace—albeit, 8* I am not envious of a traitor's title, nor has this neck of mine supported this head, scanty of locks and bald as it is, mayhap worthless in more youthful eyes, for the executioner's mark to whet his skill by severing it from the parent body, as is the fate of rebels to their liege sovereign, and opposers to his will—no, let disobedient servants suffer such deserved penalties; but for us, Sirs, of this Council, be a different pursuit:—at once let the gates of this place be opened, and in a body let us go forth and meet the favoured subject of King William, Colonel Henry Sloughter, Governor of the province of New Yorke, and for the furtherance of this desired object, I hope that measures for his honourable reception will be taken, and that immediately Jacob Leisler, as in duty bound, prepare to vacate the station which he hath so faithfully held in trust for this expected moment, and for which he deserves, for the excellent discharge of duties assigned him heretofore, the united thanks of the whole colony; and that the course is simple, a deputation from among us set out to deliver our tender congratulations to his excellency, and learn his wishes concerning our offices.” Edsell resumed his seat, while something like applause and approval went through the Council, but which, although a sign of the feelings of many, was somewhat repressed by expectancy of what might be further said. “Methinks I have heard aright, and yet natheless, I count not on threescore years,” cried Milbourne, starting abruptly on his feet, nearly as soon as his opponent had concluded, while, as he spoke, his eye flashed like fire, his lip grew white and trembling with the fierce emotions of his disturbed breast, which, as he strove to restrain from bursting forth in their fury, affected his utterance. At first, a sneering, spiteful smile, if so it could be termed, sat on his flushed visage, and his voice and words were in accordance; but as he proceeded, his rage seemed to overleap the bounds of its confinement, and his tones grew harsh, thick, and in the end, almost unintelligible; “Yes! yes! thank God I have not the hypocrisy of age to plead with! I have not grey locks to call in witness— nor can I prate of coolness or experience on the score of years; but this I can do, and for it I have lived in this world long enough, I can, at a glance, see through the borrowed mask of disinterestedness, with which vile, black-hearted men seek to cover their traitorous and selfish designs. I am young—nay, not so young neither, but what I can detect a specious villain, and know when the winter-frozen adder feels the heat, that he is the first to sting the foolish peasant who hath nursed him—yea, the breast that hath warmed his iced frame will he destroy. I am frank; I do not cloak my words when I mean them —I wish to be understood; I do not say one thing with my heart and deny it with my lips, as some do; for I repeat, I can descry, even let his vizard be of iron, the hoary ruffian, who, to save his own blood and shield his worthless body from hurt, would sacrifice—betray, as though they were but cattle to be slaughtered for his pleasure, the lives of all that were in his keeping. Do you understand me, Samuel Edsell?” “For heaven's sake, be calm—this will not do,” interrupted several; “be calm—restrain this personal invective.” This interference, however, was in vain; the anger of the speaker was raised, and the abortive attempts to allay and smother his voice, seemed rather to increase its fury—for shaking off from his sleeve the hands that had officiously been stretched forth to pull him in his seat, like the baited bull stung and goaded to very madness by the repeated attacks of the dauntless blood hounds, his efforts to be heard strengthened with the busy hum of words that the members of the council endeavoured to drown it in, and became like a peal of thunder above the storm, clear, loud, distinct, and almost uninterrupted by his own exhaustion of breath. “By the eternal heaven!” he shouted, with brows set in deadly wrath, and striking his hand upon the table before him so that it rang with the violence of the blow, “who bids me be calm? who will dare still me when I wish to be heard? By hell! have I not been insulted, and ought I not to avenge it? insulted, grossly insulted! a child would not bear it; and by an old and deceitful villain who thirsts to deceive us—who hungers after the favour of the new hauble that the king hath set up for us to worship—who already hath put out his lean and grasping hand for the crumbs of this fresh tyrant that hath been sent to suck the marrow of this land and to oppress us, who cares not so he is enriched, if we, the people, starve;—and doth not this old villain, who here would seem all virtue, speak of our tame submission to this cast off debauchee of court favour—this parasite, who unfit for aught but the purlieus of a palace, hath been deputed to trample on the settlers of the forest. And even this were nought to hear but to laugh at, had he not, I mean the spy who sits among us, yon aged whiner, set his mark upon me, branding my fair name as a foreign adventurer, blustering and passionate, without honour, fortune or family to lose or care for, a very bravo whose blood was to be sold to any that sought it. Now let him hear me— though not born on this soil, yet from adoption, from marriage it is mine, and more than he will do, I am ready to die for it;—then as to my name, there is no blemish on my coat, let him show it an he can:—but as to him, but scan his crimped, thievish visage, disgusting with age— that which in youth must have been ill, are they not the very features of some jesuitical priest of Alsatia, some cut throat bloated pimp, who seeketh safe neck from the hangman in the windings of that city of refuge—and do I judge from nature? his boasted ancestor should have been some done over knave, who took this country for his dwelling in preference to an airing on the Tyburn tree; and his descendant is the very mirror of himself, long since worthy of the knightly collar of hemp that is hatcheld at Newgate. What doth he say, upon no assurance but the advisers, go forth and meet and give ourselves into this Sloughter's hands! What! like whipped curs, lick the leash that cuts us—cast the weapons of safety from our hands, and await the fiat of a foe! No! let such tame, coward spirits as his do that; go, let him grovel in his native kennel, and kiss the boot heels of power—but for us, let us show ourselves men of pith and nerve, and act the deeds of men.” As Milbourne sat down there was a whispering in the apartment, and the stern looks of some betokened the taking of some momentous resolution, and many scarce drew their breaths, in eager anxiety of that which would follow—the dark and angry glances of others, and their burning cheeks, bespoke that had ought yet attached them to their companions, that the bonds of friendship were broken in twain for ever; the breach had been widened beyond all reconciliation, and it was plain there now wanted but the bold hand to make the first movement and unsheath the sharpened steel, for all to take the dagger from their belts, and quench the insults received, and the bitter hatred of their respective leaders, in the heart's blood of their former co-mates. Indeed, there were those who marked out, should such signal be given, their adversary with their eye, measuring his strength with their envious gaze, and the place even on their bodies where advantageously the most fatal blow could be given. In this stress Leisler endeavoured to interpose.— With sorrowful accent he bewailed the untimely difference that had been made, and laboured by every means he was master of, to recall the ancient league that had existed between all present; and strove, but in vain, to sooth to calm, the unruly tempest of their heated breasts. Many appeared scarce to hear him—others seemed to hearken to that which he said, but with unbending countenances and in gloomy silence; his words fell like a momentary rain on the parched bosom of a sunburnt and sandy region—sinking and drying away even as it touched the burning earth, but giving no refreshment. And as he finished speaking, Edsell rudely pushed from him his seat and stood up, as did all who were attached to him. “I have borne much, and that I have so borne such base contumely, doth even surprise me,” quoth he, “yet I have borne it. Beshrew these aged limbs, twenty years ago, ere the defamer could have spoken half his slander, I had struck him dead, stone dead at my feet; but most unwittingly time cools one's blood for instant action—so he hath said, and it is true, or why stands he living to look me in the face? and yet so it runneth within this brain of mine, that scarce bearded boys were wont to have reverence for old men; but mayhap since my youth times are altered—age keeps not pace with fashions—yet sooth had I stood by, and saw a grey head treated as this of mine hath been—God! I had seized the villain by the throat and choaked his life from out his venomous body. Yet even as it is, these limbs are not so palsied, albeit the years I have past through are weakeners of stouter ones than I, yet I do think thou foul tongued knave, I can yet chastise thee, and carve upon that coxcomb hide of thine such work that thou shalt rue the hour thou didst awake my wrath. But down, down old heart! it doth ill become thee to swell thus at a mongrel's barking; no, I will not lose my temper with thee, it befits not for thee to so triumph. Let the boaster vaunt on his superior strength, the gift of youth, and overawe such cowards as may suppose it bravery, an old man's arm will not disgrace him— no, I'll not measure swords with one whose courage, judging from his conduct, consists of words—aye, the flight from Albany gives no light proof of warlike qualities; but let that pass, and some other rumours with it that have reached me, for I arose not to exchange scurrile jests with thy vain relative, but to speak with you, Jacob Leisler. It grieves me much, old friend, for thy sake, and for our past affinity, that matters should so befall; our many years of kindness ought not to be lightly rent or forgotten. Yet so it is; together in this place longer we cannot sit: there hath sprung up that between our names that must for ever divide, like with an iron wall, our courses of life; that must make the steps I take adverse to thine; yea blood cannot erase what hath passed this night. And—nay, it is to ill purpose you would explain, for as I am a breathing man, it is not in the power of the living to blot from out the blistering calender of memory the injuries that fret me; natheless, me and mine, and all that think well of me, from this hour are strangers to yours—albeit, ere I leave you, for ancient fellowship, it were but right in me to say as by caution, that an you keep about your elbows cut-throat champions, to bully those who are your truest well-wishers, it will not be long ere you lack all but such a bravo's head for counsel, and his murderous hand for defence.” So having said, he paused for a moment, and folding his arms, gazed sternly in the countenance of Milbourne, who returned his proud glance with a look of hatred as mortal and unrelenting as that which he received, then turning from his enemy, he waved his hand to his adherents and stalked with a haughty stride, unshaken by his advanced years, to the door of the apartment, followed by such as were of his party, yet ere he departed he drew in his breath and compressed his lips, to stifle the overflowing gall that burthened him as he cast back another and a last look of rage and defiance; while all apparently expected, as it might have been, were struck powerless with the movement he had made, and none rose to intercept or oppose his withdrawal. Milbourne was the first to break forth— “There let him go, I say,” cried he exultingly, “well rid are we of a traitor and a hypocrite.” “Nien mien zon,” said Leisler, “dat is niet wel; dou art haastig, heethoofdig, mien zon.” “Thou art wrong, father,” replied Milbourne, “we want him not; such as him we can well spare, and all that have gone with him. He would within our counsel have played the spy; he could have stung us to the quick, but now he hath lost his power and his venom. Yes, let him go and fawn for a smile about the path of Sloughter; we are well rid of such dirt that but clogged our way—yea, I wish Sloughter and Bayard all such friends, who will not take long to ruin him, while we, though few in numbers have the faithful and devoted hearts that are now around us; so let him do his worst, we can defy him. And now since these false hearted partizans have fled our ranks, and by their kind desertion have left us free to act, unopposed by their vile efforts to thwart our just designs, for the best interest of our cause, how stands your minds, Sirs, that we return unto the matters from which we have been so led by their seditious artifices, and lose not in urging the immediate fulfilment of the warrant that lies before us, which condemns to immediate death the base convicts, Bayard and his associate.” “Nay, my good friend, Milbourne, on this matter permit me to be heard, and be not ruffled at my opinion,” exclaimed De Lanoy, in a voice soothing and temporising: “yet I need not fear anger where even if I am deemed misjudging, that my heart is steel to the cause we espouse is truly known; and although than, even yourself, there is no one here more thirsting on these criminals to inflict the severities they have merited, natheless, taking time and circumstance, which doth, from the pregnant danger, demand more important considerations—for be it as it may, Edsell doth carry with him in his anger a vast power, his native Queens, besides the other counties of the island will at this, his disaffection, bow to the rising star, the new comer;—all this and that, it were policy for the present to spare life and watch the tide's flowing, doth the more impress me that to act over hasty in this matter were rash; very, very rash.” “Now, by the blood of this right arm,” interrupted Milbourne warmly, “my choler choaks me, to listen to a man who boasts of sense parle thus timid and weak. What, have you too caught the ditty's tune, that I brow-beat this council—that I hector as I please within this chamber? sooth, it is pleasant: ye propitiate my rage, ere you say forth your honest sentiments:—by heaven, I wish not to smother the words of any man—let him have his say, and yet, I think I too should be listened to, in answer, when I believe it proper; for I am touched with surprise, Peiter De Lanoy, to see you thus panic struck— thus pallid and aghast with affright!—and for what?—a housewife's dream—a nightmare—a New-England witch's prophecy—a baseless, shadowless creation of thy misled mind—a harmless and threatening monster of thy heated brain. 'Sdeath! Edsell will thin our party, say you: let him take every sycophant like himself—I answer, we are the better for it; and let this Sloughter gorge himself with numbers.—But look to the walls that protect us— here let him pause; thus far shall he go, but one step farther shall be his destruction. We have the ammunition and the iron tubes of death within this fortress, that shall sweep in dust his hopes, however fed by the breaths of lying traitors: yea, sooner than yield an atom of our present power to this deputed knave, I, for one, would have the walls that encircle us, the bulwarks that part us from, and yet command the town below us, levelled to the sea, and carnage and death wanton within this chamber's self: albeit, adverse to me, there are some of other mind —to treat with this new ruler. If such are of the greater number, sooth, I must give way; yet I would ask, what have we to hope from him who hath been directed to counsel with Nicholas Bayard? I cry your mercy, an it be that you will bend the lowly knee and seek forgetfulness of the past, and, like tamed and subjected urchins, with covered heads and sorrowful visages, follow your master's train, content to bear his blows, his burthens and his scorn; an there be such coward spirits, such abject wretches, such paltry, grovelling souls among ye—I am silent; but death be my portion, as a man should die! I take none of your council, but shall go forth alone and dare the worst; and if I fall, shame be the lot,—the shame of dastards be with those, who, in the trying hour, catered for their safety. Natheless, I yet mistake, ye are true friends I misdoubt not, and will stand by the fate of Leisler to the last; and if the worse should come, (I repeat it,) an we should be driven to that dire needcessity, we have the means of triumph with us, our slaves have been ever ripe for plunder, revolt and massacre; but let the hell hounds loose upon our foes, put the knife in their hands, and wave the torch for havoc,—and, as I live, we shall kindle a funeral pyre, that shall light this land from the rolling ocean to the howling wilderness, and shall at once consume within its bloody and burning bosom, even with our own ashes, the hated names of our enemies.” “Cuerpo de todas los santos, senores, caballeros, an you carry on your bonaventure such heavy sheets, damme, I should think your mizzen would be after dipping salt water,” broke in sudden and abruptly a strange voice while the speaker, with a bold and confident air, trode into the very centre of the apartment. Vol. II. 9 The whole council rose in surprise, and some even in alarm, at this unexpected and unlooked for intrusion. The hands of several grasped instinctively their weapons; and their uneasiness was by no means quieted by the manner and appearance of the personage who had so boldly and uninvited thrust himself upon their deliberation. “Who,—what are you, that hast thus dared insolently to come among us,” exclaimed several, their voices raised loud and threatening with anger. “We are betrayed, treason hath glided in unseen upon us,” cried others, at once in tones of wonder and alarm. “Are there none sentry at the door—but are our counsels in the open street,” sternly inquired others. “What seek ye, rash regardless man, that within our secret conclave unbidden you have made thus free,” thundered Milbourne, advancing with furious gesture as he spoke, with sword bared upon the intruder, “come you as friend, or are you hostile to our plans? what hast thou heard, base eavesdropper? how long within the echo of our words have you stood unmarked? by what sorcerers art hast guiled our watchful guard?—deliver master the very truth, if from the reach of this sharp steel untouched you would escape.” “Straight tell the tale, albeit art an enemy—a spy upon this council; an so may the curse of Cromwell blast thee, dog—thou hast seen thy last; an I say thou hast not a clear account, thy blood is sold unto the drinking of our swords,” shouted De Lanoy, and in a moment the glittering and deadly points of a score of blades, were thrust within an inch of the defenceless breast of the daring offender: he, however, recoiled not a whit before the direful array that met his further advance. “Por el amor de dios, poco a poco, speak me fair and softly senores; carja! be ye wanting me to palaver, see ye drop your bristles and let me have sea room,” quoth the stranger, folding his arms cool and unconcerned, and gazing undaunted in look and unmoved in posture on the fierce preparation about him; “d'ye see, I take this as queer greeting to a caballero—for curse me but I am of good breeding. Yvenger quiniento soeldas, as the hidalgo says on the Main, so its damned rough in you to go this quartering when a messmate moors water shot in your harbour—and as for boarding you without letting you know, how the devil should I when there is not a man above decks from poop to windlass, and the hatches amidship are all open.” “Nay, parley not a word with the vile ruffian, but beat the craven slave to earth with your stout steels,” exclaimed Arnyte Leisler, with eyes flashing and gesture rapid with animation, as he rushed from his father's side, where a breathless and silent spectator he had remained of all that had heretofore passed, the varied emotions of his mind vividly marked on his expressive countenance, alternate pale with fear, then flushed with hope—and now his breast heaved and his limbs trembled as it were, with indignant rage, at the sight of an old and oppressive foe—“why hold you back, good friends, know you not the murderous marauder? it is the bloodiest and most cruel of Kid's savage crew—drag down the vile buccaneer.” “Voto a dios! are you there, master,” returned Eumet, for it was he, “and found thy tongue, prate a-pace valgame dios! thou hast steered a pretty course, youngster, a fine mess hast thou made of it—curse me if thou dost not deserve marooning worse than ever poor devil that has been left on the Keys in my days.” “What then, thou comest from Kid?” said De Lanoy, “what says the treacherous rover? and what meanest thou that no one hast stopped thy advance within the gates of this fortress?” A fe Cabellero, I spin no tough yarns d'ysee “replied the rover boldly,” El capitan del barco hath put out his best hawser to help you, but damn it, it wont do, the ship heaves in too strong a current for to hold; thof, had it not been for the fingers of yon meddlesome urchin, madre santa de dios! but ere this watch you had been ridden of all we had to count for fear, le misericordia asi—a dry voyage hath no help—so dy'see I have just by the old man's orders steered hitherward, to let you know the sharks are playing about your timbers already, carja, this new governor has run up his bunting at the old Stadt-huis, and is, as fast as the glass drops, out swelling the number of his followers, as the thinning of your own crew shows. “We are lost, there is no help for us,” interrupted one of the council, in accents of despair. “I wonder not, now this fellow came on us without obstacles, our very guard hath joined the general desertion, and fled with the traitorous Edsell.” “By heaven he speaks truth,” exclaimed several others rushing in the apartment tumultuously and alarmed, after having been forth and examined the certainty of their situation, “alas for us—treachery hath prevailed, our gates stand ajar, deserted—our cannon hath had foul play, and lay dismounted by their carriages, while here and there, alone of all that heretofore espoused our party, wanders a solitary friend, amid the desolation of our cause.” “I fear me this man hath brought us no false news,” quoth another, rushing in with terror depicted on his pallid countenance, “for as I went forth, and stood upon the rampart that overlooks the town, a deep and busy hum broke on mine ear in the distance, and light after light shot and flared through the darkness, as of a gathering multitude, along the rondels and about the bazaar, and methought, my eyes so read it in the night, there was something hoisted on the Stadt huis, that moved, curled, floated, and seemed like a flag.” “We are undone, we are undone, save yourselves, save yourselves, there is no help for us”—cried one rushing wildly into the very centre of the chamber. He had gone forth the first, and had stayed the longest, and now returned with irresolute step, haggard countenance, and almost breathless; all with pale and anxious visages gathered about him. “For mercy sake, how is it, let us hear the worst,” inquired the terrified council. “We are ruined, we shall be destroyed we are utterly ruined,” replied the person questioned, after a moment's pause of gloomy expectation, “I have found the evil all confirmed, a rage, a wild rage, hath seized the people, all rush to follow the wake of this new governor, our hired soldiery fly the barracks, no orders, no authority withholds them, and the new tyrant already wantons in his conquest; surrounded and advised by the Bayard party, he swears our destruction, unless instantly we surrender to his power at discretion; and supplied by means of the false Edsell, with artillery from the rondels, if we submit not he prepares to fire upon our defenceless walls.” “Well let him nor croak thy unhallowed dirge, messenger of ill, as if it were our death song; silence, raven, silence, nor with thy black omened tidings, make women of garbed men,” said Milbourne sternly, a deep frown darkening his lowered brow, “how say you now, what bring you of our foeman, that thus your cheeks should blanch to the livid coloring of the grave, and your limbs palsy, as stricken in the winter of age;—sdeath let us hear no more of these wind gathered rumours, or bear them like sea rocks do tempests, for what rain drops fall from these dark clouds, but such as men might shake from off their mantles, nor feel the heavier for the wet;—yet even so it is, when the yellow leaf sears and drops the tree is but worth the firing; yea, men crowd in its summer foliage, and rest in its shade, as though they dwelt in the circle of a fostering spirit, and now the storm is up, and strips us barkless, and bare—the coward sycophants fly our vicinity, as one would a pestilence, nor gaze back, but to direct home the axe's blow to our roots!—ah well! ah well! that my stout heart should fail:—And you old man, my sire by marriage,” continued he addressing Leisler, “how like you this the falling off of these cursed dogs, that have fed from out your trenchers, that have lived upon your bread and wine; that but a brief past of time, you would have deemed you had but to have bid them pour forth the filthy current of their veins, at your command, and their blood had flowed as water;—no matter,—I could wish the period back that, but what would it help, the world hath been ever the same,—and yet old man, in me you shall not be deceived. At times I may have been a rough friend, and done thee harm, by my quick spirit, yet I am ready to expiate such crimes, for well I know there is no help for us once in the Bayard's power—father the block be mine, that holds that hoary head—to the last, even death, will I be with thee Jacob Leisler. 9 “Mien son Yaakoop, ik dinks niet, but zo as dou ish,” replied Leisler, taking him affectionately by the hand, sdill ik hoops vor besser dimes, dings are niet zo kwaade. Alas, believe it not, “answered Milbourne,” I did indeed think that about us, there were some few who would dare cling to us in adversity, who would an it should have so came to swords, with their bodies, have taught this proud stranger, who is now to rule this province, that the wild settlers of America, were of as bold a mettle, as ever fluttering courtier of Whitehall; but such thought is over, who can gaze upon these faces about us, whitened with lily livered fear, and think there is ought left for us, but to kiss this Sloughter's feet. “Voto a dios! I swear by the bread and the wine,” exclaimed Eumet, “they have much belied thee, Captain' Milbourne. There have been those who told that you were a spark that made more smoke than fire; but damn them, d'ye see they foully lied: he viajádo por tierra, y por mar, as they say on the main, á la Espagnola, and I have never seen the man whose colours I would sooner sail under than yours, Captain Milbourne; and curse me, thof these here are thrifty of their lives, d'ye see here's the boy that'll stand by you against wind and tide as long as a plank sticks together, or there is a steel cutlass to be handled. Carja! a rover's word is cutter's law, and may I be keel hauled an I break faith with thee.” Before Milbourne could return an answer to this voluntary tribute and offer of services from the pirate, he was interrupted by the long, shrill blast of a trumpet, whose warlike note was heard to sound loudly without. It was a summons from the new governor, that those who held the fort should straitways come forth and deliver it up peaceably to his possession; otherwise they should be held as traitors to the king, and when taken should suffer the punishment of death by the laws decreed to rebels who dispute the authority of their liege lord and sovereign. “What course shall we pursue?” said one of the council hesitatingly, after having heard the threatening message. “Had we not best submit at once, nor give by our obstinacy in a vain defence, cause for our utter destruction?” “With the few that is left with us it were idle to suppose we could long hold out,” quoth another, “and yet we should not—nay, it becomes us not to surrender at discretion. Yet in this stress, whatever is best for the common weal, doubtless should be followed by all without a murmur.” “Ay, ay, cut and carve your paths even as ye list— think but for yourselves,” exclaimed Milbourne in a bitter tone, “if ye can ride the waves in safety care not who is wrecked; what boots a loss of time when it is already determined? go at once, and open the gates, and sue at this courtier's feet for pardon; go, I say, nor pause to think you have abandoned some to death.” “Nay, Captain Milbourne,” responded De Lanoy, “I must say that it doth appear to me that often, although it may be from honest zeal, you are too hasty, and many times interpret intentions and words fallen from your friends, both wrong and strangely. I will vouch there are but few here deserve the evil you would believe of us—nor is there one who would cater basely for his own life, while our good leader Jacob Leisler and our associates are at stake. No, I will say there is not one who would save his own blood by selling that of another's. Yet it must be confessed that our situation is dangerous at least, if not desperate. What have we to count on in a rash defence of this fort? we have not the means nor the provision to hold out long—and by doing so we would but increase the inveteracy of our enemies, and give, perhaps, to this new governor, a just cause for persecution, as well as a pretext for using against us the direst means of punishment, when at last we should be compelled to yield to his power. Now thus, on calm and deliberate survey of the matter, would I advise:—that certain of us go to the quarters of Colonel Sloughter, since he has formally called us to admit his authority—it will be politic methinks so to act, and thereby under cover of treating with him and learning that which it were well we now should pretend to doubt, the truth of his pretensions and commission—we may be enabled to creep into his designs, at least so far as respects his intentions towards us. Now we may have much mistaken him as for evil; but an it turn out so, let our foes beware—this fort may yet prove a bane to them; the tiger at bay in his covert yields not with life, nor till, in his mad and desperate struggles, he dies the jungle deeply with the best blood of his pursuers.” “De Lanoy speaks well, at this juncture a better plan we cannot adopt,” said one of the council, “let it be agreed that he and Milbourne forthwith proceed upon the matter.” “It is determined,” said De Lanoy, as a unanimous assent to the measure was expressed, “and hear, to quicken our departure, there hath come from this eager courtier a second messenger.” And as he spoke, another blast of the trumpet, with its harsh and hollow notes, rung on the outer drawbridge, and with its loud and fearful voice, seemed to make the very walls around tremble with the stern echo. Several went forth to receive the messenger, and parley with him from the gateway. “I like not greatly this your resolve my masters,” quoth Milbourne, “doubt me but it seems unwise, and at once puts us in this Sloughter's hands, but you have willed it, albeit it appears in good faith for our common cause, and I—an you desire my service, will not be the one to shrink from the part assigned me, natheless though it be that of danger, for it glads me to see that you have plucked spirit in distress, you have robbed the nettle of its sting, for he that boldly looks in the grim and iron front of danger, grows accustomed to its frowns, and thinks little of it. So friend De Lanoy, at once let us on our mission; be firm of soul, good comates till our return, and an I mistake not, we shall bring ye news of this Sloughter, that will make you think less of the lion's roar—” then turning to Eumet he added “be at hand, brave master, there may be need of thy stout arm, to carve a passage for our return, and a light heart like thine, I know betokens a bold hand. They departed on their adventure, while from the period they quitted the apartment, the members of the council appeared disturbed, and agitated with expectant suspense; some with hasty steps silent and in anxious thought paced the boundaries of the chamber, which seemed narrow to their eager flight of mind. Others gathered in groups and whispering their fears, were startled by every blast of wind that swept around the building that held them. Some gazed forth with strained eyes, through the small window panes in the dark night, and strove to descry aught that might stir in the city below, while others cast themselves upon the long settles by the door, that they might be ready to receive the first rumour of the event of the embassy, and avail themselves of any favorable opportunity at the outset; not one was unmoved, but all partook alike, of the deep and fearful interest of the moment. And now more than at any period of the scene, habitual ceremony and respect appeared disregarded, for Leisler untended, except by the careful solicitude of Arnyte, remained in his place, solitary and deserted, a prey to the anguish that racked his mind as he reflected on the dire straits of his fallen fortunes— meanwhile, the savage protector of his son stood mutely by, leaning on his gun and looking anxiously in the grief expressive countenances of the hapless parent and his child, as though he would fain participate in the sorrow that rent their breasts. Slow flew the laggard time; hour after hour heavily wore away, and yet there came no news from those that had gone forth. There is no time so wearisome as that wherein the mind is tortured to learn the event of any thing that deeply concerns the personal safety; suspense is terrible—a serpent who hangs to the heart strings with thirsty tongue, and momently draws blood—the rack whereon the criminal is impaled, tears not the body to agony, as its sufferance; naturally as it protracts, gloom and shadow darken the imagination, and busy thought had painted in the minds of Leisler and his adherents; long ere it had happened, the misfortunes that had befallen their legates, and which the reader will find detailed in the next section. SECTION III. Abus. Some envious devil has ruined us yet more; The fort's revolted to the Emperor; The gates are opened, the portcullis drawn; And deluges of armies, from the town Come pouring in:— Dryden's Aurengzebe. With a step doubtful, and as though distrusting the purpose for which it was used, a mind undetermined and a heart that beat heavily with a painful foreboding of anticipated misfortune, Milbourne accompanied by his associate, De Lanoy, and followed closely by the daring freebooter, who had enlisted himself in his service, proceeded on the errand, rather for reconnoitre than for the sake of forming a treaty for amicable adjustment, which, in the state of the Leisler faction, was so adviseable. Slowly they descended to the outlet of the fort, which was now indeed the last hold of their party's power, whose vaunted strength in danger had seemed to crumble to dust like an exposed corse from the touch, when disinterred after long resting in the solitude of the grave—indeed their glory had been brief; it was now fast expiring, like the quick and brilliant flash of a dying light. As they went along, the two leaders for awhile spoke not a word in converse with each other; for now the excitement which had stirred the spirit in the council unsupported by the presence of others, and the momentary cause which had enkindled the fierce temper of the one and called forth all the calmness of deliberation in the other, had passed away like the smoke of a funeral pyre when they quitted the chamber wherein their comrades had assembled; and disturbed with like feelings of distress at the disasters which evidently thickened around them, they instinctively for a while, both hesitating to break silence, avoided discourse, but each strode on his way, wrapt in his own deep meditation. The night wind blew thrilling, sharp, and cold, and the crusted snow and crisped ice, worn by the passage of the past day, crackled beneath their tread, and yet the vast heaven, strown as it were with hosts of living drops of silver, looked calm and beautiful, while the moon, glittering with radiant lustre, walked the broad sky and smiled on the earth, whose whitened bosom, glowing in the light, gleamed like innumerable spangles on the robes of beauty; all around was visible, and the long line of parapets cast their deep shadows like frowns upon the snow clad ground; the path of Milbourne and his associates was uninterrupted, except when hailed by the eager and troublesome questions and inquiry of the sleepless and despairing partizan who now and then met them, and who strove to catch from their brief replies the least spark of hope; yet as he pursued his way, the quick eye of Milbourne marked the solitary and deserted state of the garrison: shorn of half the former numbers that had composed it, and with those left all was disorder and confusion; where centinels should have been, their post was deserted, and the men were gathered in groups distant from their duty, and there were dark whispers with some, while the countenances of many in the moonlight looked pallid and aghast as palsied with terror, and the brows of others wore gloomy discontent, the murmurs of which often broke forth unrestrained like the muttering growls of some angered beast of prey, as hungered and disappointed of food he retraces his track to his darksome den—the heavens, it is true, wore the sweet look of peace; yet the mind of man as it is ever in this weary life of ours, was wrathful and tempestuous and swelling with bleak storms; indeed, as Milbourne gazed about him and beheld the truth of what had been announced to his disheartened comrades in the Council, the too palpable desertion of Leisler's former strongest, and as supposed, most faithful retainers, and the apparent neglect of every appearance of preparation to oppose the stern approach of Sloughter, which ought to have been now momently expected, and his hostile guise met with suitable reception, he felt his spirit sink lower within him dampened at the sight, and the thought struck heavy to his heart that neither the forlorn state nor danger to which they were now reduced had been magnified, and yet even more than all, there cut deep unto the core that all had been brought on by those who had been most trusted, who had been most counted friends; ingratitude had thinned the ranks that should have circled round and made a wall through which no power of man could break; yet so it was, even like the flower that adorns the bush in summer-tide and sucks its strength for life; at the first touch of winter, it yellows and drops away, leaving that stalk which had delighted in its beauty naked and defenceless, to be swept away by the wind; and yet nature parts these, the flower and its supporter, while here no cause existed for desertion except the baseness of men's hearts; and the haughty and fiery soul of Milbourne as he thus reflected felt that could he but have an hour's revenge upon the traitors who had thus quitted and sold the cause of their patron for their selfish interest, he would quaff without repining the bitterest poison of his fate, even to its last dregs— though when the drawbridge rose behind him, and the chains of the portcullis rattled as they dropt down the weight they had lifted up, while he and his associates passed under, and when he stood beyond the moat and saw nothing above the bastions but the high steep roofs of the kerck, the gevangen huis and the governor's residence, a fear arose within him that he had done rash to depart on an errand to the foe, leaving dissatisfaction and almost terror with those who still remained, and exposing his own safety at the mercy of a man to whose faith he was a stranger, and who as of course was infuriated by the show of resistance that had been returned to his summons to yield; and how such was likely to receive him and his companions, questioning his authority, even at the moment they came to treat with him, he was ignorant; albeit, he was not at ease concerning the manner they might be treated by one haughty and confident in success, and doubtless irritated by as yet an almost unbending opposition, even were this man one, contrary to the usual nature of mankind, of otherwise mild and forgiving disposition; and a hope, a lingering hope like a plank that the drowning mariner strives to catch at, even though floating far beyond his grasp—in spite of all depicted by the stern reality that, had stared him in the face, would grow on his mind and cling to his heart loth to quit him, that had he not left the walls of the fort, his activity might, in the despairing souls around him, have sown his own unquenchable fire, and the drooping spirit of the remaining partisans might have still been raised; and so strong at times did this deceiving feeling come upon him, that he was nearly tempted to retrace his steps, nor sue for one atom of kindness from the new governor, nor descend to the meanness of searching for his plans against them until the ordnance of the fort gave out its last breath of death, and the ramparts could no longer be made good for want of a man to defend them. “God's wo on Egypt light heavily upon the white hearted and unmanly knaves,” quoth he involuntarily, as the darkest side of the picture of a sudden obtruded its gloomy yet true and faithful images upon his mind, and for a time suppressed all trust and dependance on more pleasing forms: “There is nought in them, not a child's courage; the sick man's ague hath chilled them, frozen them powerless. 'Sblood! I had as soon make good a breach with a herd of deer as trust them; aye it were better, for a hart at bay oft gives fatal wounds to the hunter, while these war accoutred girls tremble too much to raise a hand gun— and yet with half the number of those we muster behind yon gallant breastwork, think you not De Lanoy, were they but men resolved to stand to the worst, though their blood ran for it, this servile journey of ours had not been spared? God! it frets me sorely; ere I could crouch to take this Sloughter's hand and cry in his train, methinks my flesh should kiss his dagger.” “Sooth Captain Milbourne” replied his comate, “my thought and resolution is akin to yours, for I feel it were a degradation to give way one atom, to this commissioned tool of Bayard, and Van Kortlandt; I go to him with as little wish for favor at such hated hands, as even you, and had there been bold hearts and determined steels behind Vol. II. 10 us, by heaven with any living man, I had not stirred a step upon such embassy as this, but when my voice enforced this counsel, you must be aware of my motives,—policy dictated the course we now pursue, for indeed it was plain, had this not been indulged our fear stricken adherents, there had been nathless all reason an open rebellion, and we who might oppose ere this had changed place with Bayard and Nichols, in their condemned dungeons; but as it is, we must bring them back so sore a tale as would rouse them were they dead, and the shroud upon their limbs,—the harness of battle is not yet laid aside, the cuirass is on their breasts, and if I judge right of the nature of men, they can be deluded to the frenzy of despair; when there is no hope of safety for life or limb left them, cowards become brave men; and mark me we can, an I mistake not, provoke this Sloughter to send with us a message that though they be palsied to statues, shall make the blood run flames within their veins; but take my advice Milbourne, be not too hasty with this man, dive into him first, read his heart if we can, he may not be so weak as we have heard, to yield to Van Kortlandt's guidance, as he were a senseless boat rowed by the oar; albeit as matters are, let us use caution, and I build on this errand of ours, as one from which much good to Leisler and our friends may come, and if fortune in this time of need, stands at our side, if not by force, at least by stratagem, we may ensnare this court parasite, in toils that he will find it hard to break. “Nay, De Lanoy, believe me you are in error,” returned the other, “no guile with all the diplomatic art of which you are master will avail; the villain Edsell is with him, and will watch our words as a lynx would his prey, ere this the accursed greybeard, (I regret he tasted not my steel) hath his ear; and think you not where the snake couches, he drops no poison? Therefore I disagree with your advice—let our course I say be bold; even if with our swords we hew a retreat, it will serve us better, as you have well devised, to inflame the dogs we leave in the shelter of the fort,—it will awaken in them that fear for themselves, until which is aroused few men are stirred on; an we meet a scurvy greeting I repeat, it will try to the last their mettle, and if they change not, poltroons as they are, they shall survive to see us die, and learn that a brave man's death, is a coward's shame. But hold, I am too loud? here are some who I should be unwilling to have heard our converse.” At the end of the causeway, which from the western gate led down the hill, whose top the fort crowned, was a long clear space, or rather plain of ground, smooth and level, and though now one desolate sheet of snow, sullied in whiteness by numerous crossed and trampled pathways to and from the fort and streets that opened on it, yet it was often the scene of hilarity and pleasure in summer days, for here the burghers held an annual cattle fair, and sometimes a market; and the choicest products of Staaten Eylandt and Mattouwacs on this place tempted the appetite, taste, and purchase of the epicure—whose eagerness had at least one good effect, that of rewarding the industrious yeoman. However, this piece of almost vacant ground had more probably been left so that the fire of the fort in a land attack might not interfere with the houses of the city, rather than for the purpose of any agricultural display; nevertheless, there had been so little danger from this quarter, that most of the cannon on this side of the fort had been removed, and about the centre of the marktvelt, (for such was the name given to the open ground,) a small building, or more properly a shed of rough-hewn boards, had been raised mostly for the accommodation of the burgomasters and other prominent dignitaries, who came to see that order was kept among the quarrelsome slaves, who were wont here to tend their masters' market truck, and who, while all went on right, quietly and comfortably in the public service, smoked and dozed away their time without fear of disturbance or interruption; for the presence of great men alone is sufficient to awe the vulgar in silence. The steps of Milbourne and De Lanoy, during the brief interchange of words above detailed, had wended so rapidly towards the burgomasters' place of respect and retirement, which stood immediately in their path, that Eumet had been left several paces in their rear, either from his having been accustomed from his mode of life to a slower pace on land, (for it is to be remarked in the manner of the mariner, that his walk on shore appears as though he trod in an element which was not congenial to his nature:) or from a conscious feeling that the two leaders might have communications to make with each other on the subject of their present pursuit, which they might not care to be heard by a third person; and so, with a delicacy unusual to one of his barefaced and insolent spirit, (but which arose from his careless and reckless soul; for he thought not who led the way, so there were blows to be met with and plunder to be fought for:) the pirate's footsteps lagged behind his companions some considerable distance, yet within a moment's call and sight. “Santa Trinidada, thou hast rode the peak truly,” said the marauder, in somewhat of a repentant humour to himself, as he thought on the little likelihood of profit in his new employ; “carra, thy soul has run away with thy reason—thou hast taken up with poor wage—curse me, but banyan days will increase an I make such cruises where there seems more likelihood of blows than marvedis—despacio! I had forgot the proverb, `Habla poco y piensa bien;' but hang care, I am in for it, and blast me if I take to the long boat, thof the ship's sinking.” At this period he was suddenly aroused from his reverie by beholding Milbourne and De Lanoy abruptly pause in their progress; and he lost not a minute, ere he was at their side: for as the former spoke the exclamation of caution, which has been narrated, they had unconsciously drawn within a pace or two of the shed above described, from under the concealment of which started several figures, whose long shadows as they rose in the moonlight, discovered them in time for Milbourne and his companion to start at their approach, and to keep off with their swords, for an instant's parley, the barrels of the levelled arquebuses of the city patrouille, for such they were who now barred the further procedure of the legates of the Leislerian faction. The group consisted of about twenty persons, whose singularity, not to say somewhat ludicrous, disagreement of dress and accoutrements, in some measure, bespoke them honest and placable burghers, somewhat emulous of military fame, and who, driven by the fervour of patriotism, for awhile had laid down their peaceable callings and in the alarm of the times, had metamorphosed themselves into the stern followers of war. As might be expected from their haste of preparation, which was commensurate with their zeal, they sat but small store on equality of size or figure and similarity of attire in their enrolment; and there seemed also little preference in the manner of their death-weapons, the choice being evidently that of the readiest; for one wore a massive and heavy breastplate of iron, and bore in his hand a rusty partisan, which doubtless he inherited as the armour of his ancestors, who, from the age and looks of the warlike appurtenance, were in all probability servitors of the `priviledged Wes-India companie,' under the rule of Christianse and Eelkees:—another had girded to his side a ponderous broadsword, and although proud in bearing so tried and deadly a steel, yet being short from the trunk to the heel, (which is vulgarly called duck legged,) this son of Mars evidently had more trouble in the disagreeable rencontres, which, on account of his briefness of figure and the sword's length, ensued every now and then between the weapon and his ankles, than possibly his enemies might have received from its sharpness and his dexterity of using it: however, as supporters to these important personages, one or two there were of the patrouille, lusty and strongly limbed, the flower of the youth of the Nieuw Nederlandts, proud of going to war, decorated with the favours of Dutch love—mighty bunches of ribbons at the knee, and defended by immense buttons on their jerkins, whose solidity and circumference were almost shields in miniature; and they were well supplied with fire arms, the contents of which they were reckless how eager they were discharged as the death warrants of a foe. “Stand for your lives, and tell who and what ye are,” exclaimed several of the patrouille at one voice. “Speak—are you for the rebel Leisler, or the king?” echoed others, their words bursting from their lips in a shout at nearly the same breath, each one appearing the most desirous to be attended to and heard, so that their speech was almost a confused and tumultuous jargon. 10* “Hold back thy officious arm,” cried De Lanoy, drawing down the savage Eumet's upraised hand, which threatened to fall heavy on the head of one of the stout burghers of the patrouille and cool the ardour of his gallantry for ever, and at the same time withholding the buccaneer from rushing on the other opposers of their progress, and dealing the destruction his vengeful eyes threatened; for no sooner had he beheld the pointed weapons that had stopped the way, ere, like the trained bloodhound when in sight of the chace, he thirsted for the death, and was ready for the onset. “And you, fellow-burghers of Nieuw Oranje,” continued De Lanoy, “seek not our lives so hastily with adverse hands, for we have trespassed on your guard not with the deadly guise of foemen, but, albeit, an there bide among ye not those who by rash and selfish bearing contemn our offerings—we come with the budding branches of the olive; yea, we have now sought ye as men desirous of settling all difference, and of giving peace to the aching wounds of this distracted province. For this purpose, Captain Milbourne and myself, (your ancient townsman, Peiter De Lanoy,) with this our faithful follower, request safe conduct from you, my masters, to the presence of him who is said to hold the king's commission as our new appointed ruler;—I mean the person men term Colonel Henry Sloughter.” “Gad's mercy, and is it you, Meinheer Peiter De Lanoy? blood o' me! which I deem a fierce and becoming oath, and savours a warrior's lip,” quoth in reply a voice at once slender and squeaking, and which was produced by the delicate organ of the throat of a lean, thin, shrivelled little personage, whose pallid visage looked sallow and healthless in the moonlight; which alike shone on attire at once conceitedly and daintily disposed upon the wearer:—so that with gorgeous profuseness of garment and consequential demeanour, he laboured with the air of one who supposed himself of the utmost importance in the patrouille, and thereon verily swelled with martial dignity, “right gladsome am I, as an I were ordered to trim a dozen body coats with fine Flanders for a ready customer, that in peace you have thus unfolded your errand, and of such an honest nature it prove; for stitch my carcass, had your object been hostile—stop my trust! but your doublet (and by this light it is of cloth, I were loth to spoil,) would have been cut in as many squares, bits, and ends, as a Merry Andrew's pantaloons, or as there are running seams in a gallant's jerkin. Gads service! I repeat it, right gleesome am I that you so soon announced yourself, Meinheer De Lanoy, for had it been another man, thof o' your quarters, seeing how much I respect thee, having oftentimes to my profit and delight, had both the making and fitting of thy wearing apparel— blood o' me! but he had tasted death at our hands in as short space as ever thread pierced a bodkin's eyelet.” “Troth, truly says the snyder,” said a ragged looking fellow, with a dirty leathern apron and a red flannel skull cap, the centre of which was crowned with a large tassel of worsted, “may I never soak the soal of a pantoufle again, but there are some among us, Mienheer, that would have waxed you throughly; snooks! I think it would have been shorts ere your upper leather had been sadly tanned.” “Py myn vaders baard mien vreint De Lanoy, he dells as drue as dat I dell, py Got!” added he of the mighty breast plate, putting on a fierce and courageous manner, “had dou been oder mensch as dat dou prove, I had daken mien hallebaard, and mit mien hallebaard I did leavsh dou no mores eyesh in dien kopt as dere vas den dou vas poorn, py Got!” “Yes, may I never blow bellows again,” echoed another, whose party coloured visage bore ample correspondence with his black and dusted linen, for he was without jerkin, and had his sleeves rolled up above his elbow, exposing to view his hairy, broad, muscular and sinewy arms; while in one hand he held a massy iron bar, which he wielded as a player would the quarter staff, while the round flat cap, that scarcely hid his coarse, shaggy, and russet coloured locks, peculiar to the artizan of the time, bespoke his following, “by the flames of my furnace, hadst thou met us as an enemy, Peiter De Lanoy, sturdy Peiter as thou art, I'd made thy brain fly like sparks from hot iron. The Bayard cause for ever—haro and battle! Body o' me, give old Stevens but a fair stroke, those fair visages of yours, Mienheers, had been little better than a rotten cinder such as I cast way in the Smidt Vly, before Asseer Leevy's tan vats.” “Good sirs, we doubt ye not, or that as things are, ye carry stout hearts to war for the factions ye have espoused,” said De Lanoy with wily caution, at the same time as he proceeded, assuming a soothing and insinuating tone of voice, which at once calmed the angry and party-heated feelings of those he spoke with, weaning their minds from antipathy and ill will, till they were carried away in sympathy of the words of him who addressed them; “yet trust me, masters; in good faith I speak it, ye are too eager for the blood of old comrades and friends; and for why?—to urge a stranger's interest, to push the triumph of a man, who but yesterday ye scarce knew breathed life: sooth, it is, methinks, somewhat unnatural that thus soon ye should forget the sweet intercourse of neighbourship. Yet green in its passage, does not memory show we have been a handful in this desolate land, a few christian men amid a desert and surrounded by hosts of savages, from whose bloody trails yet unavenged, the voices of the butchered call on us to give over unnatural feuds, and turn upon the common foe—the murthering red man and his base ally, the cursed dogs of Canada, whose crimes the smouldering ruins of Schenectadie must for ages keep fresh. Yes, my friends, forget not that our fathers drove back from the very spot whereon our dwellings stand, the raging panther and the howling wolf. And heretofore in unison, we have tilled this wilderness; yea, time out of mind have there been kindly interchanges of friendship between us, that bespoke good will; nay, there are even here many who by me have been called by name from childhood, upwards; remember you not our boyish sports together? and for what reason meet we thus with ireful eyes and hands ready to deal blows of death upon each other? Let not the early day be renewed, when blood smoked from earth, and sought at the gates of heaven vengeance on a fratricide—let not the mark of wrath be set upon us as that which the seared brow of the first murtherer fostered. Bethink ye, burghers; is it not most horrible, thus Cain-like, to be arrayed in arms—a brother thirsting for the draught which is to be drained from the veins,—yea, from the heart of a brother!” The honest burghers seemed evidently touched with this appeal. “There is somewhat in De Lanoy's words,” murmured one in a whisper to him who stood at his side, “it is hard to forget bygones; ay, many are the wildsome pranks we, that is De Lanoy there and myself, have had in hand, as Flattenburgh hill and the commons, from the swamp to the holy ground, can bear strait witness.” “In warhied dat is all dyne, mien vrients,” said the warrior in the cuirass, taking up the subject as it reached his ear; “I have had zum little vun mit him in my days mienzelf; und a menschadagt and a frauwadagt[12] [12] These were the Dutch appellations given to certain days of peculiar liberties and sports; on that first named, the young men were empowered to kiss their sweethearts, without reprehension; and on the last, the ladies were allowed to retaliate on the offenders, who were prohibited resistance. —py Got, in der Nieuw Nederlandts dere was nien jongmen dat dare dans mit him and I in a zhuffle zhuffle, dough dere hipsey saw bleased der vrauws besser—ho, ho, de jongmen now are niet zich as dat dey were den, py got.” “Ay, in my day,” returned one, “De Lanoy has been with us to pluck the goose; by gad he is a merry blade, though a rare hand at nine pins.” “Yes,” joined in another, “when we were boys it was jovial pastime. It appears but as yesterday when we had the cherevallie, wherein I blew the ram's horn before old Ruckel Depeyster's door, when he married Helligunt, the young widow of Mangle Minthorne of the Bouwerie Laneng, De Lanoy was one who helped to plant the maypoles that we hung with ragged stockings under the bridegroom's window.” “Troth, those were pleasant days, those were pleasant days,” murmured many of the burghers, as their eyes glistened with the pleasures of the recollection. “And what claim to tear asunder the ties that hath bound ye, boasts this man,—this Sloughter?” burst unrestrainedly from the lips of Milbourne, with tone at once fiery and impetuous; gathering a vehement and frantic force as he spoke, he appeared borne away with a spirit furious and bitter, o'ermastering discretion by the violence of his feelings:—“by heaven's wrath! deeply it galls me to see men like ye act as ye have borne yourselves, with maugre faith to man and God. I tell ye, most dastardly have ye done;—would honest men pursue your course, and desert in need, old and tried friends to cling to the cloak of favour? And can you give reason for such conduct?—Ye would say this Sloughter is Protestant; and on that forsooth, ye build—a sandy foundation surely is it. But, let me ask, are not we of that church? To establish the most glorious revolution, has not my father-in-law, Jacob Leisler,—who has been a burgher of Nieuw Yorke from infancy,—yea, while like drones ye have wallowed in idleness and fattened on the ease he made in his toils for you,—has he not, I repeat it,—labored supported by us his faithful adherents, who in the winter of adversity forgot not summer friends;— has he not I repeat it, sacrificed his wealth, spent his time, and shed his very blood for the good cause. And what is the reward, to find ye, as ye are, lying sycophants, coward traitors, who having sucked the marrow of his liberal hand, fly him when you find the source from whence he fed you dried, and turn hissing like horned adders upon your benefactor But what gain hath your treachery,—have the miseries you suffered under Andross passed away, so that no scar of the wounds he inflicted remains, yea do you no longer remember the vile tyrant who oppressed you, have you no thought of the chains and the prison house, have you no memory who o'erthrew the despot, who trampled on his power and his mandates as though one was as dust, and the other an idiots words, who stood rocklike against the intrigues of Jesuits, and the machinations of the base emissaries of the Catholics, and the deposed James Stuart. Who I seek in defiance of the slavish tools of that bigoted monarch, cast Nicholas Renslear in prison, and who quailed not in a dungeon to the tyranny of the arbitrary sycophant? Who I ask made ye free, and taught ye that ye were men, no worms to crawl innoxious about the spurner's foot; and where in those dark days, those hours of sorrow and distress, where were those you now exalt as leaders?—where was the office holding Bayard, whose name you shout with hoarse throats, where was the rich Van Kortlandt, and the proud Graham, where but at the sleeve of the tyrant Andross, fit instruments for a character so odious— but go to—go to—I waste breath on reptiles, who crawl in the paths which will yield them the most prey. I see in your sullen visages ye are wedded to the route ye have chosen, and are emulous of the vile name ye have achieved:—ye have fled your liberator, ye have quitted the side of Jacob Leisler, to attach yourselves to this Sloughter; and yet what warrant have ye that he is a better man than the craven Sir Edmund Andross.” Although apparently there had been a slight, yet favorable impression made on the burghers, who composed the patrouille, by De Lanoy's artfully bringing back to their minds, the days of ancient league, and intimacy, so that the hearts of some began to be changed with renovated kindness, and the stern grasp with which they held their weapons, unconsciously relaxed as they bethought themselves of youthful pranks and boyish hopes, and dangers, in which all mutually suffered or delighted, yet at the imperious invectives, and ill timed and injudicious reflections, on their own conduct, as well as of those under whose banners they were now enlisted, and whose purposes they were the avowed partizans, by at once reviving in all its pristine ferocity, the political hatred and struggles for ascendancy, and all the individual and petty virulence of the times, banished instantaneously all that the finer feelings had been likely to cherish; and although Milbourne for a short period, was lost as it were in the torrent of words, which ran like the rush of waters over the rocks of a stream, from his lips, and whose flow he found it impossible to control, for it seemed as if the flood gates of his heart had burst asunder, and a gathered store of gall sprung from heaped up wrongs, had poured out overwhelming every barrier which caution should have held guard upon, yet as his concluding words plainly intimated, ere he had finished speaking, the miscalculated and unadvised rashness of his advancing at such a time, and place, and before such an audience, the sentiments and remarks he had used, presented itself forcibly to his thoughts; for while warmed and fired by the fruitful matter that filled his imagination, the story of the injurious returns received for the labors of himself and friends, for the public weal, he could hear, see, nor think of aught about him, and was absent from all but the cause that had awakened his feelings; but no sooner had he found a moments breathing space to gaze about, his bosom filled with an expectant hope, even amid the bitter indignation that swelled it, that he had shamed the opposers of the Leisler party into repentance, and submissions, ere he became fully aware of his imprudence, by the stern and unopposing silence, by which his words were received, and the dark and chilling aspect of the burghers. And in the moment of fretful anger, that sprung from such disappointment, he added the last sentence, which partaking the feeling of the moment, fell from his lips like the last drop of poison, drained from the venomous tooth, of the expiring rattlesnake. There was a dead and speechless interval, when the son-in-law of Leisler paused, and the latest tone of his voice was borne away in the night breeze. There motionless for awhile stood the patrouille, like dusky and fixed statues; but this lasted not long, it was but an instant space such as when the tiger draws in his breath, and strengthens his limbs for a bound, upon the body of the hunter's elephant. At first there arose a deep murmur, like the groan of some mighty oak, ere the tempest is raised, or like the distant roar of artillery, heard from afar on the ocean, it was the vengeful interchange of an angered crowd, urging and encouraging those who composed it, to deeds of violence. “And was such the aim of your peaceful embassy,” exclaimed one in a tone of fierce and bitter irony, “came ye then to raise sedition among us?” “Accursed slanderer?” cried the artizan, in a voice hoarse with rage, “did you but seek our lines to throw firebrands of revolt amid our ranks, and to light up the coals of rebellion, in a band of loyal subjects.” “Foul tongued defamer,” quoth another angrily, “bring you to us naught but insult, for what dare you use words of shame, to those within the reach of whose poniards ye stand.” “For the sake of heaven friends hear me, indeed ye have mistaken that which my comrade hath spoke,” said De Lanoy, in vain striving to retrieve the ground, that had been so wantonly lost by Milbourne's impetuosity; but needless were his endeavours at interposition; the attempt appeared merely to have an effect of increasing the tumult of the incensed burghers against Milbourne, and likewise to awake its fury towards himself, for such is the blinded nature of the passions of humanity, that a weak and failing interference, is more likely to cater fresh food for excitement, than to allay its force, as some feeble barrier built against the current of some rushing mountain stream, serves but awhile, to stop the falling of the waters, whose violence congregated, and whose mass raised with unmeasured height, at length o'ertops the puny obstacle, that had withheld the running tide, and in its might bears it in scattered fragments, in its roaring race, until every particle is lost in the dashings of the multitudinous waves. “And for this did De Lanoy use his smooth tongue?” said one eyeing the person he spoke of, with a look of rage, “we'll listen no more to his cunning lies, we should have remembered that this is not the first time, he has beguiled us to ruin.” “He hath spoken of our ancient days, next he will persuade us of Leisler's kindness and humanity,” echoed another with scowling brow, “but for that, let him go look at my houseless and despoiled family, my lands barren and untilled, confiscated as he would term them, not however by an Andross, but by the accursed and arbitrary edict of Jacob Leisler.” “Who prates of that man's services to the colony,” thundered a stern tone, “I grant him active in driving the cattle from the homesteads of honest yeomen—ah! in his wrath he has laid desolate my hearth and home, because forsooth, I chose to adhere to the fortunes of such as were born my superiors, and jested at the rule of one sprung from the kennel.” Vol. II. 11 “Ay, talk ye knaves of justice and ingratitude,” spoke loudly others, “go to your dungeons and see if their bare and dank walls, confine not men, such as from your births, ye had been honored to clear the doorway for their steps, hold not your chains Nicholas Bayard, and the worthy descendant of Governor Nichols.” “Haro, cry down with James Stuart, the Jesuits, and the whore of Babylon,” shouted many, “their sway was a hundred times better than these dirt bred rulers, these offspring of lowest earth, Milbourne and Leisler.” The resentment of the irritated burghers, appeared as it were quickened by the reproaches that had burst in outcries from their angry lips, and could their menacing looks and ireful brows, have been seen as in the daylight, they would have spoken a language, at once fearful and warning to the rash offender, who had thus heedless of consequence, touched the avalanche that tottered, but for a breath to fall in overwhelming ruin,—yea as it were franticly thrust his naked and uncovered hand in the den of the cockatrice; yet there was sufficient for alarm, in the manner in which the patrouille had slowly closed upon Milbourne and his companions, and by which movement the burghers almost encompased their enemies, and approached so near, that their adverse weapons wanted but a slight impetus, to strike at their opposing bodies; and again there was that in the startling sound of their advance, the hollow noise of their heavy footsteps, and the clattering of their arms, that gave to their opponents a sudden, although a certain insight, of the danger which surrounded them on every side, and made the more apparent the weakness of their array, and the defence which it was possible to offer to such a body of men, infuriated and superior in force and numbers. The mind of Milbourne however, was not in a frame to bear the contumelious attacks that had alike been made on his own character, and that of his faction; blinded by a mad zeal for power, and an unchecked pride of spirit, that had grafted on a nature genial from birth, grown from a late unbounded sway, it would have been worse than death, for him to bend his haughty soul, and seek peace or give way in the least, to those who even yet he considered as a herd beneath him; indeed he was not one to beseech, or tamper with the vexed and resentful, for rather than sooth the tempest to a calm, he joyed in braving its might; and however for an instant the chilling aspect of the situation of himself, and the friends who accompanied him, may have presented itself to his thought, and checked his ardour and boldness, it was but as a brief fall of water, on some raging flame, that dampens and beats down the bickering light, with its momentary weight, but which in the end only causes an increase of the streaming blaze; yea even the very knowledge of the hazard in which he stood, seemed an addition to the food of his passionate resistance: “Dastard losels, dare ye parley thus to me,” cried he in a tone whose energy was strengthened by the ire that pervaded him, so that although his lips trembled and grew white, yet his blood ran as it were a liquid of molten lead in his veins, and fire flashed from his eye hate and defiance on his adversaries, “dare ye dishonest mongrels breathe your venomous lies and wag your noxious tongues in my presence and hearing, may God's curse on Egypt light upon ye all, consuming and scathing your false hearts to ashes. What, do you press upon my guard?—back curs; dogs, back I say,—or, by the power that made me, ye will raise a destroyer among ye that ye little wot of withal:—ay, I will rip with this good steel your foul breasts apart, and wash out with the best blood ye have, your latest life's blood, the accursed calumnies ye harbour and have presumed to prate against those who have been unjust to themselves, that ye are now free to utter the scandal.” “Poco-a-poco, and is it come to that, santissama Espirito! messmate, give us a fair sweep with my toledo, ere you bear down,” exclaimed Eumet, eagerly flourishing his hanger, after having been a silent, though not an inattentive observer of what had passed; “carja, we've a flota against us, but here's the hand that'll stem the tide—we'll try these landsmen's mettle; thof I've known 'em to speak bold enow; yet no nos concoenios, as we say on the main—the lubbers turn as white as the mainsheet, at the sight of the galerdeta of a true marinero—so, hard ahelm, hearties, and lay 'em aboard.” For an instant the sturdy burghers were overawed, and gave back in their advance, daunted by the bared and glittering steels that flashed before them and confronted their approach upon their opposers; but it was but for a single step they retreated, for reanimated by a sense of their strength and the fewness of their foes, they quickly regained their vantage, threatening with ferocious haste to overwhelm their antagonists. “What, are we braved by such as these!” roared the artizan in a hoarse and brattling tone, and furiously shaking aloft the bar which his hand held with a powerful grasp, as if it had been a billet of the lightest wood;— “nay, neighbours, shame not yourselves by a retreating step, but drive the hounds, as though they were but ashes to scatter by the wind.” “On them, burghers,—on them,” cried one; “beat them down to dust;—we are ten to one, and will teach the rogues better counsel than they have yet born.” “Nay, masters, let me but have a moment to explain; —ye are all acting madly, and will rue these angry steps;” said De Lanoy, striving to no purpose, for an opportunity to prevent the direful consequence that evidently was about to ensue and follow the fearful breach of amity that had so unwisely been made. “List him no word, but onwards—tear them in atoms!” thundered, or rather yelled, a dozen voices, drowning in the fierce outcry, the efforts of pacification: “on to the death, and spare no life!” was shouted by others in tones that made the very air ring with the sound, as if it was shaken by the sharp report of a cannon. And in all probability it would have taken but a short time, judging from the frightful resolution by which the patrouille were actuated, and the terrific thirst for retribution for the scornful language they had received, that pervaded their bosoms, to have executed their purpose of destruction, for adjoined to the other infinite advantages possessed by the burghers over the slender weapons of their adversaries, was that a moment's unfortunate indecision, or rather wonder at the frenzy of their opponents on the part of Milbourne and his fellows, who, as it were, startled at the screams of insatiable revenge, that deafened them from every side, (as one having thrust, in wantonness or by accident, the match in some loaded magazine, would be astounded at the terrible explosion, surpassing in its loudness all he had ever pictured,) had afforded the burghers of the patrouille a chance unscathed to crowd so near upon them that there was no room for a sweep of the swords, which, in a manner became useless, borne down by the weight of pikes, clubs, and the other rude though powerful arms of the citizens; indeed so tight was the struggle, that Eumet abandoning his trusty steel, sought in haste to level his arquebuss with deadly aim, but he had scarce loosened it from the supporting bandalier ere a dozen hostile hands had grasped it firmly, and strove to wrench it from his hold, which, in spite of his furious endeavours at defence was soon effected, and he himself beaten down almost senseless amid the trampling feet of the combatants, while in vain also were the desperate strivings of Milbourne and De Lanoy to contend in the unequal conflict, for although many of the sturdy burghers were unused and awkward in the wielding of their offensive weapons, and their strokes readily parried, making their part of the fight attended with more ludicrous noise and clatter than serious risk or danger, yet there were those whose strength of arm was death bearing, and the splintered rapiers of their opponents appeared a speedy omen of the enforcement of the threats of utter annihilation, that was hoarsely shrieked above the tumult of the contest. “Death to the hated miscreants!” was echoed in fierce cry from mouth to mouth, as the assured issue of the combat became momently the more evident. “Aye, tear them in pieces!” cried the artizan, maddened by success, “hear no call for life, but leave the dogs not an atom of flesh, that shall not be a gout of gore.” This last horrid encouragement was received by a tremendous shout of assent, that spoke as with a voice of despair to the hearts of the failing partizans of the Leislerian faction, whose fate now looked inevitable, and to whom it appeared as if there was no means of preservation 11* or escape from death left; yet at the very instant the fatal result so surely to be anticipated, was about accomplishment, at the very moment as it were, the suspended blow of destruction was about to fall,—for at the time of the artizan's denunciation, Milbourne and his companions were completely at the mercy of their foemen, and above their unguarded and now defenceless heads, waved halberd, musquetoon, pike, and club, ready to descend and scatter blood, brain, and life to dust,—at that last stress, other voices than those engaged in fight, rang with cries of forbearance on the breeze, and the uplifted weapons simultaneously were withdrawn harmless from their direful threatening, as by the hand of enchantment. “Hold! hold this disturbance!” exclaimed the strangers, “here comes the burgerwagt.” “The burgomasters! the burgomasters! back, Mienheers, back!” said those of the patrouille, one to the other: “yet keep an eye on the captives—back! masters, back!” As the patrouille divided and gave way, through the opening left thereby, between the adverse parties, the new comers advanced: they were a considerable body of armed citizens headed by two magistrates, who having been alarmed by the noise of battle and tumult had quickly departed the city for the scene of contest on the Marktvlet, and although their steps had been lighted by flambeaux of blazing pine splinters, making their path as day, yet such had been the eagerness and engrossed minds of those engaged in the fray, that these had not been perceived, although a considerable distance had to be crossed from the beaver gracht, the street from whence the burgomasters and their followers entered on the plain to attain the spot where the combat was carried on; where having arrived, the two important dignitaries who took the lead, strode forward with solemn, slow, and becoming gait and bearing, and gazed in wonderment on the ireful adversaries. They were both short, squabby looking men of unwieldy shape, the one apparently in size but little superior to the other, and both resembling cushions well stuffed; they wore huge three cornered cocked hats, with monstrous bunches of yellow ribbons stuck in the place of cockades, as insignias of their faithful adherence to the prince of Orange, William the Third, King of England, and their approbation of the protestant revolution; the one was close wrapped in a monstrous night gown of staring red flannel, well tucked round his throat to keep out the cold, while the other, more hardy in the city's service, no way concealed his under dress by outward cloak or wrapper, but shown in his lead coloured jerkin, with mettle buttons, his yellow breeches, and paste shoe-buckles, all of which were sufficiently visible in the torch light. These personages bore in their hands, the more as emblematical of their station than as assistance to their steps, a tall mahogany stick, the top of which was crowned by a carved acorn blazing in Dutch mettle; this was called a burgomaster's wand, and even unto this day hath the custom come for the chosen rulers of the city to bear on momentous occasions a like emblem of their consequence. “Pugh! pugh! what is the—pugh! pugh! I have lost my—pugh!—breath!” spoke the last described character, with thick and hasty utterance, puffing and blowing with the fatigue he had just endured in bringing, or rather rolling, his mighty carcass to the place of disturbance; “What in the fiend's name's the matter? pugh! what a race I have had!—pugh! pugh!—who the devil has had the audacity—pugh!—to kick up such a dust; pugh!— breaking the peace of his highness' loyal subjects, and— pugh!—that of the puissant burgomasters of the honest city of Nieuw Yorke? Here is some one, brother Gelyn—pugh!—that is desirous of the stocks, the wooden horse, or the—pugh!—cucking stool.” “Ja, Mienheer Filkins,” replied the other dignitary pompously, “dis is most lyk dis is zo; ja, Mienheer Filkins.” “Sirs, a most grievous and violent breach of faith, hath, by these men of yours, been committed against us,” said Milbourne hastily, stepping forward and addressing the potent burgomasters, “we came from Jacob Leisler to have an interview and treat for terms whereby peace might be restored to all, with Colonel Sloughter; but disregarding the sacred character we bear, and which even De Frontenac's salvages would have respected, as you behold, they have met us with the sword's point, and, but for your timely presence, even now we had been foully butchered by their villanous hands.” “How now? pugh! how now?” exclaimed burgomaster Filkins, “what's this? pugh! what's this I hear?” “The false-tongued hound lies—basely lies!” cried the artizan: “body o' me! under pretence of friendly errand they came; I grant his say so; but they forgot that pretext, when, with poisonous lip they strove to wind us from our duties—but they found true steel, not to be bent;—and it was to retaliate the slurs he cast on us in disappointment that we would have slain him, and his dogs who follow at his heels. May I never screw an anvil more if I could not now beat to death the treacherous knaves.” “Thou worm!” said Milbourne, shaking in defiance his shattered steel; “thou talkest brave; but had I to meet thee on equal ground, palsy wither my arm but I would make thee change thy boastful vaunt.” “How! speak ye that—speak ye that?” returned the artizan, raising his bar as about to strike down his opponent; “by the breath o' me, thou shalt rue thy words, master.” “Huti-tuti! Mienheers, do you forget who's present? pugh! here's a todo, a hubbub, to be sure—pugh!” quoth Alderman Filkins, interposing his authority between the disputants: “a fine riot here, brother Verplank.” “Mienheer Filkins, ja,” said burgomaster Verplank, “dis is besser sbordt dan to zee der haanekamp in vrouw Schakerly's haanemat, at der Old Slib. I'll bet you, Mienheer, dree dotkin on smidt Stevens; don't let's sboil der sbort, Mienheer Filkins.” “It wont do, it wont do, brother Verplank; it would be a blot on the laws of the Council of this city—pugh!” answered burgomaster Filkins, “ye had better make it up, Mienheers, ye had better make it up.” “What, shall they go unharmed and free?” exclaimed several of the patrouille, indignantly. “Shall we not trample down these friends of Leisler?” muttered others. “Huti-tuti, masters! who is the judge of the best, you or I?—pugh!” quoth the burgomaster, drawing himself up; “would you take the law in your own hands?— pugh!—for what was I elected burgomaster?—pugh!— to be dictated to?—pugh!—I tell you ye had better make it up—pugh!—for if you don't, as sure as my name's Filkins, I'll have you all whipped in the rasp huis yard, for lasæ majestatis; which means, not obeying my commands— pugh!”— The patrouille remained doggedly silent, which was, however, favourably construed into acquiescence on their part by the lordly and puissant burgomaster, who now, in his turn, most courteously extended an offer of safe escort to the rescued Milbourne and his companions to the presence of Colonel Sloughter, which, of course was eagerly accepted by them. And after numerous admonitions from the burgomasters to the patrouille to restrain their impetuosity at aggression, though at the same time to keep watchful guard, the partizans of Leisler departed in company of the magistrates towards the city, leaving the patrouille at their stations, gazing on their retiring forms with unsatiated hatred and vowing revenge. “There let them go!” said the artizan, glancing on their fading forms a look as spiteful as that with which the fretted and caged hyena scares the spectator from his sight, fearing that the iron bars of his prison may be too weak to hold the enraged beast: “There let them go, in the fiend's name,” said he, “their good fortune hath it been that now they were not stiff and cold before us— yet body o' me, the time shall yet be when this arm of mine shall yield the dogs death.” “Nay, Smidt Stevens, an Sloughter act the man;” said one—“more fitting hands for them will do the office you seek; the rope and the hangman's kiss be their portion.” “Death, to the hated miscreants!” murmured in stern accord the whole patrouille. In the meanwhile, safe from the anger of their ruthless enemies, the objects of these menaces proceeded with their doughty conductors across that part of the marktvliet that separated them from the city, and passing the narrow entrance of the marktvelt-steegje,[13] [13] Now called Marketfield-street, or Petticoat Lane. they pursued their way towards the great dyke which ran in the centre of the town. As they moved along, the torches that were borne in the train flashed with strong red blaze upon the dark and night shadowed houses of the burghers of Nieuw Amsterdam, lightening for an instant with fitful ray, the gay painted brick and heavy rock stone of which they were built; and often the green glass of some hastily opened casement, gave back, alike with the glazed tiles of the steep roofs, from whence the snow had slid away, and whose smooth surface shone like mirrors of polished steel, the trembling reflection of the passing flambeaux; although, when they first entered the dark lane, whose rough path of half frozen mud and snow they were obliged to thride, to gain the thicker settled part of the city, all seemed dark, still, and solitary, unbroken by voice or step of passenger, and the long line of buildings, whose gable ends fronting the way, frowned on them as they went beneath, without sign of living thing inhabiting them, and looking like rows of funeral mounds, so stirless and desolate they were; yet as they hastened onwards, the scene changed: the tumult of afar off crowds was heard, the trampling of many feet and cries of people rushing to and fro; soon was seen lights, and groups of men hurrying confusedly along or collecting in throngs as if in discourse; and then came blasts of martial music on the air, the sound of trumpets and of kettle drums; the windows of many dwellings were thrown open, and by the blaze of their night lamps, the masters looked forth on the busy gathering of their neighbours—every body appeared anxious and stirring. “By mine office,—pugh!—this hath been a restless and fatiguing night—pugh!—for the city authorities,” quoth burgomaster Filkins, “in the saints name, brother Gelyn,—pugh!—I think they had better make matters up—pugh!” “Ja, Mienheer Filkins,” replied the other dignitary, “dere is no vun in dis—ja, I wants beace, for I have bet mine dwo year golt to run against Mienheer de Witt's merrie vor dwo bushel of seawant. Mienheer Filkins, I bet you your dotkins on mine golt; dere ish not his lyk dis zide of Bestavers Killetje: he will drot out Peiter de Witt's merrie. If you can zettle dings mit der stadtwogd, Mienheer Delanoy, you will zee mien golt on der gorse, and I will bet mit dee.” “Sincerely, burgomaster,” answered De Lanoy, “do I desire that such may happen, and that friendship once again may be the bond between us, and that in our native sports and exercise we may alike meet in amity; and if such luck fall, Mienheer Verplank, I will not retreat from your challenge, and stand ready to wager.” The burgomasters and their companions having now crossed one of the light wooden bridges that was thrown across the canal that led up the heeren gracht, began to wend their way down the hoog street;[14] [14] After called Little Dock-street, and was on a line (though nearer Stone-street) with the present Pearl-street. here the throng increased, and it seemed as if the inhabitants of the whole place had poured towards this one quarter, a motley group of every sort and calling; striplings and grown men. Here was the mean clad mechanic, and there the rich attired shopman, all girt, however, with such arms as they could procure, and mustering by the light of many torches as it were a time of deadliest need and danger. The character of Milbourne and his two associates was soon made known to these, and their reception from the rabble was such as to show the resentful hate which was felt towards them: groans, hisses, and cries assailed them from every side: “down with Leisler, down with Milbourne and De Lanoy, their reign is over—a new time hath come!” was fiercely shouted around them; some had even the hardihood to confront them in their path, and shake their pikes and clubs in their faces, by way of insult; others threw balls of ice at them as they walked by, and huzzaed and threw up their caps for Sloughter and his new Council. The light foam stood on the lips of Milbourne, and his visage was convulsed with passion, as he returned the angry glances of his enemies with a look of spite and rage equal to their own, and had it not been for the judicious conduct of the magistrates, his fury would soon have broken bounds, and he would have burst in some act of open violence on those who had so grievously assaulted him: but the burgomasters, finding their authority exerted in vain, to quell the attacks of the crowd, turned quickly and precipitately into a by-way, and in a short time with rapid pace left the aggressors behind them, the rabble forbearing to follow their retreating steps. The path they had now taken was called by the Dutch sleyk steeg.[15] [15] Was situate where Mill-street now runs. or mire lane, and led in the rear of the stadt huis, and passing by that building, opened on Coenties slip, whereon the stadthuis fronted; ere entering on the slip, however, they paused a moment to take breath from their hasty flight, and gave a quick glance on the scene before them, while the puissant burgomasters sought to renovate their wearied frames and recover their lost wind, ere they ushered themselves in the presence of his excellency, Colonel Henry Sloughter, Governor of their Majesties' loyal province of New-Yorke. The whole slip, from the wooden step of the stadthuis to the tall masted skippers that lay moored at water's edge, under the breastwork of the rondell, seemed a moving mass of men, of burghers and schutters indiscriminately mixed, and all apparently busied in warlike preparation; all was alive with torch and flambeaux—here was heard the clattering of the artizan's hammer, as the drake or pedero was mounted on its carriage and levelled at the direction of the walls of the fort, whose white bulwarks on the distant hill looked like drifts of snow,— and again were repeated from others words of marshalling and array; yet the proceedings of the persons who composed what appeared to be the principal group, were such as mostly engaged the attention of those who looked on the stirring scene; for although the eye found for awhile amusement in the labours and movements of the busied and industrious burghers, and drew a faithful conclusion from their actions of the motives that inspired their conduct; (for here was one zealous and single souled with the spirit of party, and there was another at his side, toiling alike in forwarding the purpose of his fellow, though actuated by a very different feeling, selfish to provide for his own safety and interest, nevertheless, apparently emulous of hazard in the cause he had espoused, as if for its own sake;) yet last, the observer rested solely on that chief point of attraction, from which all the objects that engaged the attention of the commoner had seemed to emanate, or at any rate took direction, the station of such, who, from their manner and bearing, claimed authority of those who thronged within the presence, the spot where the Governor himself stood, attended by such who had already felt the sunshine of his favour, and were installed in power near his person. In very different guise and appearance from what the narration left him, was Henry Sloughter. Recruited by a lapse of several hours, food, rest, sleep, and many comforts had his wornout frame enjoyed; renovated by these somewhat of its ancient freshness had been restored to his cheek, and the brightness of the eagle glance to his hazle eye, late dim and faded as by the palsied touch of age; the faintness and sickness of his weary travel were gone, and he strode firm and proud in manly strength, yet there was a paleness and haggard cast upon his countenance, but whether the hue was such as sprung from a life of wassail and debauchery, and was no stranger to his visage, (for such a life he was said to have passed from his earliest youth upwards,) or was the effect of the sufferings he had so late endured, a dying mark such as the plague leaves on the brow of the rescued victim of its rage, was hard to determine; albeit his voice was deeply toned, commanding and martial, and his fine though sallow features darkened, by locks whose sable die vied with the black-bird's wing, and hung over Vol. II. 12 his forehead like the dank and drooping foliage of a weeping willow, gave him the bold frank look of a warrior; and such indeed he was, but unfortunately for the province whose destinies he for awhile was appointed to direct, and whose sole government he possessed, his looks were his greatest virtue; his appointment to the office, whose duties he was about entering on, was an unhappy one, considering the turbulent and disorderly state committed to his will. To direct the helm of power at the time of this history, there was wanting a man peculiarly talented, of conciliating disposition, yet active and determined in his resolutions; one who at this critical conjuncture, was able by his influence, as well to reconcile a divided people, as to defend them against the wiles of a cunning adversary; the implacable foe of the English, DeFrontenac. Though by nature Colonel Sloughter was a man of energetic and thinking mind, capable of much; yet from an habitual indolence, a wayward and idle spirit, this quality was of but little worth to him, and except in times of the utmost need its possessor seldom brought it in play, and even then too often, the better capacities lay dormant, deadened by the effects of riot and dissipation: there were indeed certain periods when as if stung by a scorpion, recollection darting through him, conscience was alive, and he felt that he misused the blessing he possessed, and that he had been created for better things than he had accomplished, yet this reflection was but of brief duration, like wells of sparkling water in the barren desert, few and wide wastes between; so that the space of his administration was weak, short, and troublous, as might from his character have been expected, for he wasted that time which should have been passed in the public service, in the pursuit of libidinous pleasures, the thirst for which had been instilled as it were, into his very being, by the fashion of the dissipated and luxurious court of Charles the Second, to whom in his boyhood he had been a page, and he became a ready instrument in the hands of the ambitious and designing, who in his new advancement had attached themselves to his interest and by his own reckless conduct, went far to prove the dark outlines given by the historian of his character, for in speaking of him, it is said, “that either in the hurry of the king's affairs, or the powerful interest of a favourite, a man was sent over, utterly destitute of every qualification for government, licentious in his morals, avaricious and poor.” However, at the present introduction of this personage, he appeared alive to the stirring spirit of the time; there was neither the inertness or imbecility of indolence about him, and he strove to implant on the minds of those who surrounded him, an impression of his activity, favourable to his first essay in his new government. But unfortunately, the latent fire within him was awakened, rather by the opposition that had been offered to his explicit demand of submission, and the acknowledgement of the high authority and commission with which he was invested, than by a stern sense of the fulfilment of his duty; and, indeed, the misguided obstinacy of Leisler and his partisans had a strong influence on a temper by nature quick and revengeful— arousing the worst passions, confirming the dislike which the Anti-Leislerian factionists, (who had gained his ear,) had with wily insidiousness instilled into his ready reception, into a bitter hatred; so that he now superintended, and urged forward the preparations of hostility against the infatuated Hollander and his partisans, with the emulation of one devoted to the interest of the inveterate foes of the Nieuw Nederlander, more than with the calm decision and deliberate procedure behoving him, who, from the lofty place he held, and considering the circumstances of the period, should rather have sought, by even absolute sacrifices, in some instances, (but which would have been merely temporary,) to have soothed the wounded feelings, and healed the breaches that the disorders of the revolution had made in the bosom of the oppositionists; or at any rate, have forborne all violent exigency, should the chance have presented itself, than to have pursued matters to the utmost measure of the sword. But even had there been an opportunity for such better principle,—there were those at his hand who would not have allowed it sway; their endeavours being alone at strengthening and inflaming the frame of mind in which he was:—nor were such efforts thrown away. Within the circle of his step was to be seen the haughty form of Van Kortlandt, returned, as it were by magic, from his exile, called by the sudden and scarce to be expected change of affairs that was taking place, and by his presence, showing how long digested was the powerful movement that had been made against his enemy, and how deep, yet how covered, were the pitfalls that had been dug in the path of the blinded Leisler. And there too, anxiously prying into every whispered secret, and peering through the crowd of his fellows, rose the thin, harsh features of Graham, while his wily eye darted, like the piercing orbs of a snake, on all about him: and close to his side stood the heavy and brawny form, and stolid and unmoved visage of Richard Ingoldsby, while the long white locks of the fugitive Edsell waved in the thronging crowd of fawners, who sought the attention of their new master. Such was the unfavourable and unpropitious aspect that Milbourne and De Lanoy were about to brave in the parlance they had sought;—advancing, as it were, to an encounter with a host of ruthless and unforgiving foes, rendered more inveterate by the opening prospect of success that lay before them, and keenly alive to the recent injuries they had received. Favoured by the obscurity of Coentjes Alley, (in which they stood,) to whose gloomy and narrow-mouthed entrance unpierced by the lights in front, two huge buttonwood trees, (one of which rested its branches on the eaves of the roof of the stadthuis itself, and afforded in summer an umbrageous retreat to hundreds of swallows and martins who built their nests undisturbed in its sacred branches, and round whose body near the ground, were fastened benches for the accommodation of the burghers who felt inclined to sit thereon and smoke their pipes, and listen to the news that might be stirring of a summer eve; for the place was a resort for politicians and all such idle and windy characters;) added additional darkness: and not being distant many yards from where Sloughter and the group about him were; (for although by means of a wooden railing that girted the stoeb of the stadthuis, they were forced to make a considerable circuit to attain the governor's presence,) yet from the alley, Milbourne and his companions were so near him, that they had an uninterrupted sight, and even could hear all that was going on, at once distinguishing the forms and attitudes and voices of the speakers. Sufficient time also was granted their curiosity, from the tardiness of the worthy burgomasters under whose protection they were thrown. For these dignitaries, foreseeing no small exertion would be necessary for them to make their way, even when backed by their magisterial influence, through the numbers that intervened ere they could get to the presence they desired and wished to conduct their convoy, and being also not a little wearied by the labour already undergone, appeared by no means desirous of being in a hurry to adventure their comely persons in the perils of the jostling throng, but wisely took a brief space to make up their minds and prepare their bodies for the hazard, and watched an auspicious moment to commence their progress. In the meanwhile, the bosoms of the adherents of Leisler beat indignant as their eyes scanned with ireful glances the heart-galling scene that was passing within their view; for what dagger, though driven to the heart, can give more pain;—what poisonous liquid in the chymist's calendar can deeper seeth the soul, as it were with burning flame, than to hearken to faithless lips pouring out their ingrateful tales;—yea, listen to the words of the hypocrite—the fly, that lived in the warmth of our chamber unharmed, and fostered by our succour—in congratulation of the triumph of a mortal enemy over our miseries;—to mark the flowings of the self-same fable,— the specious falsehood that beguiled our confidence, used for the purpose of gaining place in the favour of another, and those vows that we believed savoured of a sole devotion, readily transformed in attachment to our deadliest enemies; and worse than this,—subservient to the new alliance, the very favours received from our cheated friendship become the theme of mockery and 12* derision—a banquet catered by the time-serving sycophants on whom they had been heedlessly bestowed, to gratify the malignancy of the new object of their dissimulation;—and such was now the case; for Sloughter, at the moment, was receiving the joyous greetings of a herd of courtiers, who moved as well by the appearance of success that favoured the speedy issue of the conflict, with the stubborn deniers of his authority that the time presented, as by sanguine hopes of advancement, by early declaration of amicable sentiments on his entrance on the first step of his office;—and among these might be noticed not a few, who, on the former part of the evening, hovered in the sphere of Leisler's influence, and appeared at his call the most strenuous of his servants and advocates. The reader most probably has some slight remembrance of Mienheer Jacobus Kip's pointed though brief remarks, in the conclusion of the first section of this book of the narrative, for the personage among these latter worthies, who was most conspicuous in thrusting himself in the eye of the Governor was the same character, the outlines of whose virtues, the shrewd schepen remarked on in a manner which was not only forcible but true;—for foremost in the troop came Dirk Van Rikketie, than whom no man was more indebted to Leisler for promotion and fortune, and than whom from unsteadiness of faith, none was more undeserving, and who disregarding every honourable tie, no sooner could form an accurate judgment of the flowing of the tides than he sought the very first chance proffered to lend his assistance to the destruction of his patron; nay, not content with utter desertion, with the eager avidity of a long injured and determined foe, Dirk sought to pull down to dust the idol by whose pedestal he had hung in worship, and strove as though his life depended on it to overwhelm in ruin the man who, worthless as he was, had placed him high in office; for Leisler, on the dereliction of Bayard, had bestowed on Dirk the two important public places of the colony, the one known as Geheim Schryver, or Recorder of Secrets, the other as Receiver General of the Revenues; and these stations Dirk had now for some time filled with considerable profit to himself, and with an excellent eye to his own interest; and being withal much used to the duties of the offices, he had no desire to resign them, and this, together with what appeared to be the popular voice, for that, no matter how adverse to justice, was solely Dirk's guiding star, were most probably the motives for the present conduct which he pursued; for he is to be acquitted of all inveteracy of heart, for he was one who would not harm a worm if he thought he could gain nothing by his inhumanity. The looks of this creature bespoke but little of his origin, as well as the contamination of the world of intrigue in which he had for many years been engaged, had altered his feelings. His father was a good substantial yeoman, who industriously tilled his fruitful acres at Newtown, (a little Yankee settlement on the Mattouwac,) and had designed his son to the same following, when he (the old man) was gathered to his fathers; for the child bespoke not in infant years aught beyond common faculties; nevertheless Dirk was an adventurous spirit, and not to be tied down to such honest livelihood, for he soon found it took small knowledge or tact to become a knave, and his first lessons of experience were reaped from pilfering water melon patches and orchards, in which essays he always had the address to escape detection, or turn by artful falsehood punishment on the heads of his innocent playmates. Emboldened by his young operations, he soon hit on the line of his abilities, and was articled to some pettifogging Connecticut attorney, (a species of animals that were fast collecting in the new colonies of America, like the maggot, who soon calls his armies where'er there is fresh carrion to feed on.) From his master, Dirk learnt more lessons of sheer villany than even his own ingenious brain had heretofore believed existing, but what he was taught was not wasted, but rather improved by his fertile mind, and perfected to an adept he entered on his practice in New-Yorke; there it was not long ere by dint of his accommodating temper, which of course fitted itself to all occasions, he brought himself into notoriety, and from one degree to another he was lifted to the favour he enjoyed. Dirk was, in personal appearance, little, mean, and insignificant, though studiously habited, with eye dull, unmeaning and vacant by nature, but which was lighted up by a wild and habitual quickness and condescension of countenance, which was alike extended to Mienheer de Heer, the burgomaster, or to Corneljse the fisherman, which nominal applied to a well known dirty losel, but who was uncommonly meddlesome in the politics of the period, and thereby often from his free expression of sentiments, was elevated to the exercise of the whipping post or the dignity of the stocks; yea, the same smile that with affable kindness lit up Dirk's visage beamed on the prosecutor and the culprit whom he sentenced in the course of his office, which gave him a place on the bench in der hoofdt scout hof, (a sort of court held by the mayor and burgomasters, in the rasp huis hall, for the purpose of trying and awarding summary punishments to drunken Indians, thieving negroes, and other petty delinquents, and in some measure answering to the court formerly called Mayor's Court, by which name the records of the time in some instances term the one in question, although the authority of the court of burgomasters appears in certain cases to have extended to denouncing on criminals the sentence of death, or having their tongues perforated with red hot iron.) Yet there was no convict so low, or whose crime was so atrocious, but Dirk addressed with the words, “mien zeer vreint,” and was ready to shake hands with him under the rope and wish him well through his punishment; nevertheless, be it confessed, Dirk was sometimes very severe and inflexible, but in such cases, the hue and cry of the populace directed his manner, and from such judicious bearing there is no reason to suppose that Dirk did not deserve the appellations which were universally ceded as his due, of a smart, cunning fellow, and `an independent and upright judge;' indeed Dirk was the adoration of all the city of Nieuw Amsterdam, for he was ready to help any one in difficulty with his advice, and to give any body a good character, so as it was not contrary to public feeling or his own peculiar advantage; in truth he was one whose equanimity was a source of admiration: he was always like the surface of a mirror, smooth, clear, and unruffled;—but not like the glass was he to be looked into; he was, nevertheless, patient under insult, and if he thought it of moment, would kiss the foot that spurned him, and beat down by his courtesy all enmity, for the veriest contempt was received by him as one would receive a favour, came it from the hand of one in power; he was albeit, a true doglicker, a thorough broken spaniel;—although it behoves to mention here, that the chronicle notes there was one brief and momentous period of his life that Dirk's actions did not adhere so strictly to the tenets whereon the latter portion of his existence appears to have been directed, and as if forgetful of his accustomed sound policy, in no matter whatever to endanger his person,—whether it was he thought if he escaped the hazard the better for his interest, or that he was unawares drawn in an ebullition of temper, an experiment, from whose manifest folly he derived much after experience, in shunning the same rock; he was unadvisedly betrayed into ire, so far as to run in risk his precious limbs: the spirit of party at the period alluded to, as usual in the province, rose uncommonly high, so that a chivalric rage seized on those who attached themselves to any of the disputing sides; each man called out his antagonist, and either with the hand gun, lance, or stave, laid him at his feet, or lost his own life in the fierce encounter. It so happened in those irascible days, that Dirk fell foul of a rough, long shanked, raw boned, giant of a fellow, who was bullying and ripping out oaths against all that were of a different mind with himself; in the matter, Dirk, though fain to retreat, was so entangled that he found there was no getting clear without a mortal combat;—so with a sad heart, Dirk met his opponent, who having been a leader of the train bands at Paulus Hook, (in which latter delightful spot, he was a resident, his employment being, with three long limbed, strapping brothers, all fighting bullies like himself, that of a cowfeeder and grazier on the salt marshes of Pavonia, while his visits to New-Yorke were for the profitable purpose of disposing of cheap milk to the households of the prudent Dutch citizens,) in the affair in question was armed with a tremendous andrea ferrara, the unexpected sight of which, so terrified the valorous Dirk, that his legs, for fear, verily slipt from under him, so that he fell backwards towards the earth, which received him unkindly, for the rearward extremity of his body in his descent struck with such force the butt end of an old musquetoon, which had first dropt from his hand, that he bore the mark of the tender contact ever after, and halted to his grave; and whether it was from this cause, his limping, or from the instability of his principles, and the little dependance to be placed on his honour or his faith, that the surname of Van Rikketie was given him is uncertain, however, taking all things into consideration, it could not have more truly been applied. With the unsteadiness of gait that hath been mentioned, though with a face smirking with smiles, pleasant and winning, Dirk advancing made his way past those who intervened between him and the Governor, overaweing with his superior effrontery less barefaced flatterers, and abashing, for very shame at his extraordinary priority of talent, the host of his fellow sycophants, who were assembled for similar purposes, and who were unable to compete with him in his career of dissimulation, but shrunk in his rear as humble followers and admirers; though Dirk took the precedence of every one, yet most courteous was his progress, bowing and grinning to every eye he caught; this fashion Dirk had learnt from some popular character or other, finding it took vastly with the greater portion of the multitude, who, it is well known, are most gratified when they have it in their power to boast that they are on an intimate footing with men in office, that they talked of such an affair with such a one, the koopman of the stores, who said so and so, or that they had just received a profound obeisance from such a one, the Roymeester, who, of course, is an extremely fine fellow:—nevertheless, Dirk's imitation of affability was but second hand, praise worthy as it was, yet as all second hand imitations, it was open to censure, for there were those who inviduously revenged their spleen on Dirk's advancement to fortune by terming him the ape of the worthy, whose manners he had adopted. Neglecting nothing, however minute, in respect to the personage to whose notice he was about recommending himself, Dirk took care, notwithstanding the chill night air, to uncover his bald head, and thrust his doffed cap beneath one arm, while the other supported a crowded bundle of papers, and one or two well bound (in neat calf covers and with brass clasps) treatises on the laws of the world, and the honest province of New-Yorke; nor was Dirk unwise in such display, for he discovered thereby at once his anxiety, even in the midst of his multitudinous duties of station, to be among the very first to salute and tender his adherence to his excellency, and it likewise showed with what increasing diligence he applied himself to the demands of the public, that he could not stir abroad a moment without bearing with him the fruits of his application. In truth, Dirk had just been deeply pondering, weighing, and considering on all points a critical case that he was to decide, and which he had just concluded on, and was so elated with what he deemed his own cleverness, or rather, as he supposed, his having as is vulgarly said `hit the right nail on the head,' in his making up his mind, that he could not in his heart separate himself from the paper whereon he had drawn out his opinion; indeed he has some little intention, if chance favored to sound the Governor on the point, and learn whether what he had determined on was acceptable; if not, he would have time to reverse and accommodate his sentiments, to an accordance with those he found most popular. The thing was this, it happened from Dirk's being receiver general of the revenues, that all matters of mulct and penalties, were to be cognizable before him; and thereby there came under his especial purview, an examination wherein one Simon Jantz, a thick headed market boor, entered his complaint against a person in office, named Myndert Van Schayck, the son of old Levinus Van Schayck, the public vendu meeter; of the said Van Schayck's having infamously tricked him, the said Simon Jantz, and also, of his having made a purchase with false measures, or rather not according to the standard, kept for the example of all fair traders at the public wharf, by the eyckmeester, and like wise at the pack-huysen, or stores of the colony; now the latter was an offence, and answerable to fine, while the former came out to be, that Myndert having an old negro who died from very age, and seeking to get rid of the expense of his burial, hit on an expedient therefor, by going to the market in Dock-Street, where Jantz had a large quantity of eggs for sale, and made a barter to the purpose, that for as many eggs as he, Van Schayck, could support by placing his hands close to hips, and stretching out his fingers, which were by no means small, the eggs as Jantz understood it, being heaped thereon against his body, between his hands as mentioned and his chin, that he Van Schayck, would sell him the said Jantz, a capital negro fellow, if not without fault, at least without one fault that was common to any black alive. It happened that the bargain was artfully brought on, by Van Schayck's leading Jantz to inveigh against the slaves he possessed, who were an obstreperous, noisy, riotous, drunken set, who wasted every thing, and who were out night and day, which gave the other an opportunity to mention he had one he would part with cheap, who was a sober steady dog, by no means riotous, wasted nothing, and would never give an insolent word, say or do what you would, and what was better, never showed any inclination to stir from any place he was set. Misled by these recommendations, and believing that Van Schayck could not hold many eggs in the position agreed on, at the motive for which proposition Jantz did seriously marvel, the arrangement was gladly made by the witless churl; who to his surprise at the fulfilment of the bargain, beheld the wily Van Schayck, seize on two monstrous baskets, which contained all his eggs, and making a place therein to take a firm clinch, by dividing the rushes at the bottom, Van Shayck being a stout fellow was able to raise the baskets to his body, and planting a broad flat chin, like a horse shoe, on the upper rim of both baskets, which by this manœuvre were brought close together and steadied, he walked out of the market, leaving the barterer thunderstruck at the contrivance, surrounded by gaping boors, and grinning burghers, and the laughing-stock of a herd of breechless urchins, who well knowing Van Schayck, had gathered to see the sport; but this was not the worst, for no sooner had Myndert deposited his burden at his house, which was adjacent to the scene of action, than taking the dead negro, and setting him upright in one of the baskets he had obtained, and which of course not having been mentioned in the exchange, he considered ought to be returned, he had him conveyed to the anxious and expecting Jantz, who would not receive him, but being furious at the deception practised, carried the matter before a burgomaster, who wisely deeming `a bargain, a bargain, all the world over' decided against Simon, who thereon was forced to take and bury the negro. But Jantz being a true obstinate determined character, made up his mind not to sit under his injuries quietly, but to get redress if such was to be obtained, and therefore in conjunction with one De Witt, an ingenious descendant of the great pensionary who followed the law, and who was always at Jantz's elbow, spiriting him on, he entered an information against the vendu meeters son, for buying the eggs without being measured according to the edicts of mienheers the burgomasters council on that subject; thinking by taking this new ground, that he would effectually revenge his own wrongs as he was advised, by means of a public punishment and prosecution,—for Jantz felt like many of his modern prototypes, that it was much more safe, convenient and certain, under the cloak of an anxiety for the enforcement of the criminal law, as a good citizen, to proceed against Van Schayck, wherein the public had the benefit of his own impartial testimony, than to risk the uncertainty of a civil inquest, wherein both sides were equally admitted to a hearing. Not in the least adverting to the subject expressed, whether Van Schayck or Jantz was right or in error, it is impossible to think without detestation of the abuses that are practised in the manner just mentioned, whereby honest men are at the mercy of every craven rogue; for what safety is there for innocence—how little are some men bound where their feelings are wrought on, where their interest is at stake, by the sanctity of truth, by that which in the present Vol. II. 13 times is but the mock solemnity of an oath; how much more true justice is there even in the bloody custom of the savage, who with the simaugan and tomahawk as next of kin, pursues the slayer of his tribe with unceasing foot to death; the heart of the Indian in such matters, is not more thirsty for revenge than the white man, nor is it often that the last is deterred by that which might sooth the noble and untrained passions of the first; although civilization boasts of taking the knife from bad men's hands—of allaying the fire of hate by the wholesome regulations of social existence, and the difficulties of attaining sudden or unmeasured retribution for petty and insignificant offences, and of tempering punishment to crime; yet what doth all amount to, when in reality it but sanctions the arts of the designing knave—but affords him the means of defending himself by legal influence from all attack to perfect the blackest schemes;—he alone being heard, his adversary kept silent by the unjust barriers of form; the one unable to assert his defence and probably provocation, while the other sets in motion a hundred engines of destruction to assist his fell purposes. As the matter of the eggs was plainly proved, that they were unmeasured in the basket, Jantz merely meting out a quantity as he sold them, Dirk Van Rikketie felt himself, as has been set forth, in a profound quandary; now his doubts it behoves to mention, arose not so much as to any obscurity in the edicts, but rather as to what manner according to the expressed words of the law, he could reasonably decide in favor of the vendu meester's son; for this same Myndert was an influential character, being son-in-law to a great man, a burgomaster or some how or the other very powerful by connexions, so that from the instant he knew who was concerned as defendant, he, Dirk, was inclined in his favor, although before he attained such knowledge, he swore to Jantz, that he would ruin the losel; however, the decision he prepared amounted nearly to this; that howbeit it might be penal to sell without measuring, yet the edict did not state it so to buy; therefore this case was not within the meaning of the law, which Dirk learnedly proved from numerous Dutch legal authorities, of which he had always a number in readiness on all occasions, and for every view he chose to adopt of the subject under discussion before him; but it is most grievous to state that this wonderful faculty—this admirable research possessed by the worthy Dirk, had begotten him the sneers of the invidious, who although it was perfectly well known that Dirk never used any references but genuine ones, yet his ill-wishers (and the very best men have them) went so far as to say, that not one out of twenty of the decisions which he repeated as confirmatory to those made by him, were to be found in the authors whose names he tacked to them; but to the question decided—for among other convincing arguments to the purport, Dirk remarked, that the whole procedure on the part of Myndert, the negro sale, and delivery, with the manner of getting the eggs “was nothing but a petty fraud, and held out by the custom of merchants;” and the information was therefore dismissed as falsely laid. The sagacity of this judgment cannot be sufficiently applauded, suffice it, that it has met the admiration and even adoption of later times. From all that has been related of Dirk Van Rikketie, it is not to be wondered at, that Sloughter received a man of his importance, effrontery and astonishing acquirements with at once a degree of pleasure and distinguished attention, and after a very brief conversation, was fully convinced that Dirk was a person proper to receive emoluments and office for his faithful attachment during all his life to the strongest side; for there was no dark spot in his character which Dirk was not ready to palliate and excuse, in a manner that did him singular honor in the eyes of his excellency; and as the chronicle records, Dirk with a fulness of fortune unequalled, not only under Sloughter, but Ingoldsby, Bellamont and many succeeding rulers, kept his place, exercising at all times that judicious courtesy, which went so far to raise him conspicuous above those of more common abilities, and which in the expressive language of the Apostle, “made him all things to all men;” yet who would believe the saying of the ascetic Mienheer Jacobus Kip, is remembered even in these days before all his virtues, “dat besser mens dan him were hanged.” The interval devoted as is above stated by the burgomasters, to whom it is now full time to return, to recruit at once body and resolution, having passed, the worthies with those accompanying, set out to encounter the bustling, jostling and unceremonious elbowing of the motley crowd that thronged before them; and it was not without much pushing and thrusting, motions very grievous and disagreeable to the portly magistrates, who drew breath hard from fatigue, and with great entreaty, the exercise of authoritative demand, and the frequent use of the burgomasters wand athwart the bare breech or rough head of some surly ragamuffin, who took vantage of the general confusion to show out in all the pride of native stubbornness, and scarce sooner would stir for a heer than a fellow-boor, way was at last made, the rather that the populace recognised the Leislerian partizans, and were desirous to learn what was to follow, than even for the dignified appearance of Mienheers Filkins and Gelyn Verplancke their conductors; for to the latter they were usually forced to obey and succumb, and therefore with natural doggedness, delighted in every opposition however slight to power, in the same spirit that the rabble in these days drive in the centinels who are stationed to keep the crowd back from pressing on a line of soldiery on parade; while another impression was made by the sight of Milbourne and his associates, that excited at once attention, surprise and curiosity; and instinctively with eyes rivetted on them, they gave back as they would were the adverse factionist culprits passing onwards to trial or to execution. On arriving within a few paces of Sloughter, Mienheer Gelyne Verplancke, addressed him, and announced the apparent object of those he escorted. “Heres ish may id bleaze your axgellenge,” said the doughty burgomaster in a pompous style, such as is used by a herald proclaiming the entrance of a knight in the lists, “dis mans Mienheer Jacobus Milbourne, and dis mans Mienheer Pieter De Lanoy, and dis mans Mienheer, what der tuyvils hish name, gome do make a gontract mit your axgellenge mit beace—and do gongradulade your axgellenge on your zafe goming do dis gundry mit your gommission, Got zafe your axgellenge and Mienheer der king.” “What seek ye sirs of me,” said Sloughter, sternly casting (while his brows gathered above them) his quick eyes on the adherents of the man, against whom ill will was already sown in his heart, as they approached him as if by his look he would have pierced them through, “what seek ye sirs I say of me,” he repeated— “We have come Colonel Sloughter,” replied De Lanoy for his companions in a tone of voice mild yet firm, `to bear from your own lips, how far the unfortunate differences that hath subsisted in this unhappy country can be settled— to learn your feelings towards ourselves and friends— whom we have been taught to believe, you suppose the aggressors against their majesties' will; in such supposition Sir, I must be permitted to tell you, you have been misled, grossly misled—for although twice to your demands have the fort's gates been closed—though twice this night we have refused you entrance therein or submission, can you if you are a reflective man condemn; you are a stranger—your whole procedure since your first landing in the province hath been a questionable one, and even now we are unconvinced by what authority you have proceeded, to take the name and right of governor of this land;—and for this too have we sought you Sir, that you may as in reason and in truth you are strictly bound, give us satisfaction on this head, and exhibit to us the sanction that you boast of his majesty king William, of whom we as well as yourself, profess to be loyal and liege subjects; and this we request you to do forthwith, as if such be the case that your commission is genuine, it would indeed be wrong for us to oppose your will, but if otherwise as in duty he is bound, Jacob Leisler will spend the last blood drop in his heart, ere he yields one stone up to your possession.” Sloughter hesitated a moment ere he answered, apparently as if he debated whether he should speak or not, or at once break the conference: significant looks, as the 13* countenance of the governor darkened, passed between the bystanders, and the withered features of Edsell, as he listened and gazed on the ominous expression of Sloughter's visage, lightened with a half suppressed smile of triumph. “Ye have come late to question sirs,” quoth Sloughter cold and sneeringly, “and judging from your modest demands, ye are conquerors and we the craven bondsmen, made by your doughty lance and bow.” “It may be that we are not the first to greet you Col. Sloughter,” abrupt and warm broke in the voice of Milbourne, his quick feelings stung by the Governor's manner, “but lack that service.—As good protestants, are we to cry cap in hand to every vagabond, who sets up the staff and claims sovereignty. Who vouches for every man, that may take mind to impose on public credulity?—No, Sir, Jacob Leisler called to the high office he exercises, by the voice of this colony, sees not fit to lay down the investure, without knowing well to whom he resigns his powers,—shall he take any man's say so?—rather I think it would have become one bearing an undisputed title to govern this land, to have sought the Lieutenant Governor, and exhibited to him his document and seal, than to have skulked in the hiding places of the disaffected, and the fastnesses of lurking rebels, sucking in the malignant fables of such who envious and revengeful, sought to heat his breast to equal hatred with their own, and it would seem he was not loth, but like the wolf lapping blood, eagerly feasted on the banquet of scandal.—I am a bold plain-spoken man, Col. Sloughter, and wither my tongue when I speak not what I feel; your present reception of us, your conduct confirms, nay your own breast may answer, to the truth of what I have said; and were it the last word I shall ever breathe, I would repeat you have not dealt openly with us.” As he listened to this rash speech, the eyes of Sloughter glared like balls of fire upon the headstrong speaker, and he bit his nether lip in anger, till the blood and froth that hung upon it mingled, but yet keeping down his ire for awhile, he heard him through, nor offered to interrupt him, while those who stood beside Sloughter, and read the signal for their motions, in the index of their master's countenance, awaited with anxious expectation in readiness to execute the stern mandates, which it was likely he would give, and denounced the fate of the son-in-law of Leisler, and his followers in their hearts. “Then I read ye aright Sirs,” said the Governor with an assumed calmness of utterance, “ye have come hither to rate me, as ye would some arrant school boy for disobedience; forsooth I sought not this Leisler, and in humble guise waited his leisure to receive and acknowledge me, or rather till he chose to use me as his passive instrument, to forward his vilo ambition? 'Tis well Sirs, 'tis mighty well—and possibly I should have had the benefit of your sober guidance and experience, and I wot not what else honors I might have attained. Good Sirs, I do confess me, that in my joining with these men around, I have done most wrong, acted most criminal, albeit you having so high a claim on my first attention, natheless it is not late to repent, or make you reparation therefor.—It shall be done, and you shall have leisure to examine my commission: But dogs” continued he, changing the ironical tone in which he had spoken to one loud and fierce, “it shall be in the dank dungeon; fools, that ye are—what think ye of me, that ye beard me thus, that ye brave me as it were in the very pitch of my power? wot ye not it is dangerous to tamper with the javelin's sharp point, that it is death to press the poison bag of the serpent;—out on ye, for besotted blinded knaves, whose madness hath endangered your necks—ho! there master Mayor, where are your lackies,” added he turning to Van Kortlandt, “let them take these fellows and clap them in close custody, the crime is high treason, that is charged against them, and an your hounds look not to their watch Master Mayor, peril my head, but they will be like to ride a worse horse than the wooden one.” Van Kortlandt joyous and eager as he received the Governor's intimation, beckoned the guard who attended him by virtue of his office of mayor of the city; for in his old dignity he had been speedily re-installed, the friend of Leisler, who had for awhile fulfilled the duties of the station, having taken refuge in the fort; the soldiers hastily advanced at the sign. “Beware sir, ere you enter on the risk you have commanded, pause Colonel Sloughter, ere you commit a crime black and infamous,” hastily ejaculated De Lanoy, “a crime that will damn your memory for ever, a crime against all faith, adverse to honour and the laws of nations; you have forgotten sir, the character we have came hither in, the envoy, no matter what his offence, is sacred from all hurt; the vilest barbarian that ever lived, respected such as sought him in that garb. There is no excuse for wanton aggression on that sacred and holy bond of virtue, that hath bound nations at war; the sword's point sinks to the earth before the white flag; dismiss us therefore unharmed, since you will not hear our offers or treat with us; as a man, as a soldier, it is your duty to give us safe conduct to our friends.” There was a moment's silence after De Lanoy ceased, ere answer was returned, and when the pause was broken, other lips than Sloughter's gave reply. “Ye waste words on idle air,” quoth Edsell as if glad of the chance to vent his malevolence, “the Governor will not condescend to speak further with traitors, yet to relieve you on the head of faith, I answer, that the customs which are extended between belligerent powers, are of non-effect, when applied to committers of treason,—you are not here recognised as aught but rebels in arms against the commissioned servant of their majesties; the lawless keepers, probably the murtherers also, of two distinguished and worthy burghers of this province, Colonel Nicholas Bayard and Walter Nichols, and so ye are attainted; so preach ye not sirs, of law or virtue, but bethink ye of atonement, for the high misdemeanours laid at your charge. Burghers,” addded he to the guards “forward, it is the Governor's pleasure that these knaves be disarmed, and bound neck and heels.” From the lips of several hundred bystanders, rose a terrific shout of triumph, long hollow and dreadful, that echoed in the midnight, like the burst of a tornado, as in an instant De Lanoy, who stood more unguarded than his companions, was overpowered and stript of the weapons of defence, that he had in vain strove to use with effect; but though he was borne down in strength and arms, yet he was not so in spirit, for his soul was roused to its utmost by Sloughter's conduct, and like the chained mastiff raving with anger, and thirsting for revenge, he could have bit in twain the rude bonds wherewith he was hastily girt;—the conquest however of his companions was not so easily accomplished, for being alert and aware of the danger that approached, the buccaneer shook off with a sudden jerk, the hand of the soldier that was first placed on his garb, and seizing the momentary opportunity so afforded, by a spring he freed himself from the presssing throng, that encompassed him, and made his way to the stoel of the stad-huis, where planting himself firmly against the wall, he fronted his foes with stern visage and levelled handgun, which from his elevation on the step, had a fair sweep for effect. At the same time, nearly simultaneous with the action of his bold follower, Milbourne taking advantage of the fluctuation of the crowd caused by Eumet's unexpected movement, tore from the man who advanced nearest upon him, the heavy partisan with which the soldier was armed, and hurling its weight before his step, forced from the path those who immediately pressed upon him, and dashing with sudden force through the opening thus made, he cleared the space that was between, and seeking the same object, stood in an instant at the rover's side. “Santo Espirito! ye hungry Dutch sharks,” roared Eumet with a voice shrill and dissonant; “an ye press me so stoutly, your gunwales shall such blood, carja! thof I go by the board—voto a madre de dios, more than one pilot o' ye shall heave the same lead 'fore I touch bottom:”—and as he spoke, he pointed the arquebuse among the throng of his enemies. It is a true remark, that there are but few things of more effect for the brief moment, even on a wild, enraged and confident assemblage, than a determined bearing on the part of the weak and attacked, showing the desperate formed resolution of selling life at its dearest rate; such as the swelling breast of Milbourne and his flashing eye indicated to be the decision he had made; added to this was the reckless and fearless ferocity of his companion, who, accustomed to bear down odds by boldness, and to woo death in every shape, scarce reflected on what must be the positive end of such unequal battle. The courage and spirit of the pirate of the time is too well known to descant on. Careless of numbers or dangers that it would seem madness to brave, these men fought in their daring adventures with a fury and success truly wonderful, and with a fierce hardihood and strength that overcame every thing before them—entering in spite of their defences, rifling and sacking with sword and flame fortified towns and guarded places, defying in their search for booty, as it were, all mortal power—braving storm and ball, climbing from their low and sinking barks the main chains, and sweeping from all opposers the decks of the tallest ships, careless, like devils incarnate, of fire or steel,—were their daily habits. In such actions and frequent conflicts had Eumet been inured to every stress; therefore, although to both their desolate situation and hopelessness of escape were apparent, yet with grim frowns they gazed upon their foes, and neither as they looked did a cheek blanch, or a limb tremble; but, with the front of entoiled lions, they stood undaunted and unmoved. Those who have pursued with unrelenting and unabated heat the rapid and timorous flight of the chase, when they meet the furious animal at his last struggle, give back in wonder at the creature's mad desperation, and hesitate ere they brave his death thrall; even so was it now with the throng; the threatening attitudes and ready weapons of Milbourne and Eumet had their brief effect; for amid the wildest and unrestrained rabble there are few so rash as it were, to be the first to commence violence and throw away their lives, for the gratification of their companions. Though, indeed, after the first blood is spilt there are none who will withhold their hands from the slaughter, yet there are seldom those who delight in yielding themselves as the first victims: still, the smallest incident was sufficient to free them from restraint, and to unbridle to the utmost the sanguinary tempers of the burghers; yet they felt the slight advantage of the station ofthe others, and even the clamour and cries for death, with which all hearing for awhile had been drowned, sunk so low for a moment as the buccaneer glanced his quick, sharp eye around to search him out an object for his ball, that his wild cry and hoarse shout of defiance rang high above the uproar of his adversaries. “Ha! that voice is not young in my hearing, nor do I see that face for the first time;” cried Sloughter, animatedly, his peculiar attention drawn to the marauder by the loud, fierce utterance of his braggart threats, and the hesitation of the crowd; and recognising the ruffian mate of Kid and one of his late persecutors—“murthering dog! is it thee,—pirate, robber,—yield thy forfeit body to the law.” “Base, treacherous hound!” answered Milbourne to Sloughter's cry, shaking aloft the halbert with which he was armed;—“we spit at thee, and spurn thy orders as we would thy neck beneath our feet; for cursed be this hand of mine—palsied, I say be it, ere I crouch to word of thine: thou mayst triumph, cur, but it shall be when Jacob Milbourne can neither hear nor see thy smile of conquest.” The rumour of what was passing in front of the stadt-huis seemed to have spread abroad with astonishing velocity, and from great distances every one that could bear themselves, uncrippled by age or disease, had hurried along in bands to that quarter. The populace had now collected in a promiscuous crowd on the slip, amounting to several hundreds, and were incessantly increasing by new arrivals, each one seeking the spot, desirous of bearing a part in the scene about enacting, or urged by curiosity as well as interest, strove to thrust themselves forward in the throng. The mob momently grew closer wedged, those behind pressing to get in advance, scarce suffering the persons in front to bear back a step from the ground whereon they stood; as the numbers enlarged, the more deep and vehement were the muttered menaces that passed from their lips, which were fast growing to cries of hatred and inveteracy, that were now strengthened by the brave uspect of the factionists; and with fierce looks like the mastiff that has been driven back in his first attempt on the baited bull, they gazed on their devoted foemen. The narrow windows of the Dutch houses, the roofs of buildings, and the masts of the yatchen became places for spectators, and were filled with people, who with clamorous outcries and savage gesticulations, urged those below and within hearing of their words to the commission of outrage, which they, from their situations, to participate in were unable. The intimidation caused by the gallant front borne by Milbourne and Eumet was but momentary, and to such fearful height had the feeling of the burghers arisen, that during the brief yet fierce passage of invective between the parties above detailed, their speech could scarce be heard above the terrific imprecations that filled the air; and at the very moment the bold voice of Milbourne was exerted to its stretch in proud defiance, he had but closed the utterance of his determination to die ere he would submit, when there was hurled from some powerful yet unknown hand from among the crowd, a missile, weighty and sharp as the head of some javelin; its aim was certain and it had been sent with care; with tremendous force, that gave back a sound, hollow and fearful, it struck the unprotected bosom of the unfortunate partizan of Leisler; as he felt the blow, he sprang upwards in the air a foot or more, while the halbert that he held dropt from his loosened grasp, and he flung his arms out with a motion like the swimmer; at the same moment, there gushed in a stream, blood, thick and dark, from both mouth and nostril, while with a last long faint and smothered shriek of bitter agony, he tottered and sank upon his face; as he lay upon the ground, there ran through his limbs a slight shivering like one that is touched with sudden chillness of blood, and then the fierce Milbourne lay motionless. No sight had beheld from whose hand death had been given; yet it was marked that the direction from whence the missile came was that whereat Edsell stood, and it is said that his aged features when his enemy dropt down, wore a grim smile of joy, but that it flitted in an instant, leaving no trace upon his visage; and although his hand trembled with age and there was apparently too little vigor in his old arm to give so fatal a blow, in after times when men's minds were changed, and the hot zeal that now heated them with blind rage, was cooled and passed away, he was not seen, even till the day of his death,—but dark whispers and hints were dropped among such as looked on him; few held communion with him; he lived a solitary life, and died, it is reported, though stricken as he was in years, by his own hands. Panic and consternation at the deed for an instant overwhelmed the crowd; surprise at the length to which their own audacity had carried matters was succeeded by a doubting and sullen silence; but this was not to last;—Eumet saw his associate fall, and expecting the next moment to share his fate, hastily discharged his arquebuse with deadly effect amidst those nearest him; the ball buried itself in the breast of a burgher, who rolled with a piercing groan, weltering in his heart's blood, at the feet of his companions; those who stood by uttered a cry of sorrow, and as they beheld the blood that had spirted upon their garments, the relenting feeling that had possessed their hearts at Milbourne's fall was extinguished and a yell of rage and vengeance burst from every lip, in one wild outcry, terrible as that with which the tigress mourns its young;—the former fury of the multitude redoubled; a hundred pikes and clubs were extended to satiate the thirst of their hearts; shrieks, groans and hisses of execration filled the air; with merciless power the weapons of the pirate were rent from his hands, and he himself felled upon the ground beside the senseless form of Milbourne; not one but a hundred hands had stricken him down—the passions of the infuriated crowd now knew no bounds—the voice of the governor was unheard amid the uproar; in vain were endeavours to quell the riot; the destitute and defenceless state of the objects of their hate availed not to satisfy them; no single voice of expostulation could rise amidst the storm; at one moment a hundred hands had grasped the bodies of the fallen adherents Vol. II. 14 of Leisler, while numbers, unsatisfied, fought to attain the hold from those who had seized on the inanimate victims; with tumultuous screams, with horrid exultation the disfigured trunks were dragged along the earth, and pulled to and fro, and dashed, with wanton brutality, on every side; handsful of mud and dirt were cast upon them; on the bruised limbs heartless blows were showered, and fierce feet trampled them down; soon was every shred of garb that covered the mangled flesh torn in rags, and the breathless corses looked not of humanity, but rather shapeless and disgusting masses of filth and gore, for which numerous madmen were contending; it was not long ere the trembling limbs were torn apart and hurled in the air while yet palpitating with life, and as though they were priceless, the livid and discoloured remains were caught up by the struggling populace as they fell among them, who followed every new act of savage cruelty with hoarse shouts of applause and gratification; like the wild dogs who battle over the bodies of the slain for a mouthful, they snatched from hand to hand bits of flesh that they stripped from the bones, reeking with gouts of blood, and he that could obtain a strip of skin, peeled from the scalp with the hair yet clinging to it, or a piece of flesh, however small, to hang upon the end of his pike, gloried as in a deed of praise. In a very short time almost every particle of the dead had suffered such division, and was borne aloft upon the weapons of the throng as trophies of triumph, while alone here and there, scattered upon the earth were deep thick pools of blood, or beside some stone, unregarded, yet clung a shred of brain that had stuck there when the corse had been dragged away. Suddenly, as when a wind changes on the sea, and takes the current in a different course from that in which late it had flowed, a new idea took possession of the minds of the brutal populace; a cry was heard among them that gathered strength as it went, and with gestures of menace, and fearful clamours they pointed towards the fort, and in an instant to that direction the whole crowd turned and poured forward, like a host of mountainous waves rolling up the beach, bearing in front of their path, upon two pikes, the torn and mangled heads of Milbourne and Eumet: the gory visages presented a horrible and ghastly spectacle, as the quick lights of the flambeaux flashed upon them; no eye could recognise the pallid and convulsed features: the skull of one was clove asunder, and the scalp hung loose and lacerated; the eyes of the other had been rent from their sockets as though plucked out by the beak of a raven, and the lower jaw was torn from its seat; with such terrific ensigns did they march)—onward they went, waving the bleeding trunks on high with malicious triumph.—All was tumult and commotion in their way, and their tread sounded louder than the lashing of the angry surfagainst an iron-bound coast. Many with fearful yells joined in the train of the frantic mob, while others terror struck, fled their path; and there were women and wailing children, with pale looks and dishevelled hair, that with wandering eyes and beating hearts, gazed forth upon the rout, as the horrid uproar assailed their ears, startling the sweet visitation of sleep from their night couches, and filling their astonished bosoms with consternation and with awe. The fate of their embassy however, reached Leisler and his confederates, together with a warning of the approach of the enraged populace, before they gained the gates of the fort: as the murmurs of their coming indistinct and doubtful like the gathering of an army, were heard, terror and horror blanched the boldest cheek, and for awhile, struck powerless every listener of the tragedy;—each held his breath, like the stag, driven in some dell that is girt round with woods and hath no outlet but the entrance, and indecisive and despairing, they gazed one ach other; then as of one accord, there rose from every lip a wild outcry of sorrow and of mourning; some stood like frozen statues unmoved, to await the death they could not fly;—others beat their breast in agony, and strewed their hair with dust, in womanish affright. Soon brief and fearful was the debate they held;—the alarm of the coming host was already given—the imminent danger was at the press—the outcries of relentless foes were borne upon the night, and with their slender force it appeared madness to contend; and ere the throng had thundered on the oaken gates for admittance, Leisler and his companions had sought such safety as flight could yield; and when the doors crashed beneath their blows and fell inwards in splintered atoms, the blood-thirsty mob found as they took possession, (though they sought with savage eagerness in every suspected hiding place for food to prey upon,) no living man whereon to glut their deadly appetite for death and slaughter. And yet though safe from the butchering hands of the lawless burghers—though he heard far behind him their cries sink in distance, yet his footsteps were tracked, and the life of Jacob Leisler was spared but for wo and mourning, for the next dawn rose on him a deserted and solitary captive, in the prison-house of his fierce and unsparing enemies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOOK THE FOURTH. THE FATAL BANQUET. SECTION I. And then what bribes may do In hastening execution, do but consider.— This very age hath given Horrid examples lately. T. May. The intentions of a writer, as to the peculiar fashion which at setting out, and in the incipient stages of his labour, he may have adopted to develope his ideas and bring forward the various incidents of his work, are more than once frustrated, if not entirely defeated, as he progresses therein—like a person raising an edifice for his own residence, and who, when he lays the foundation of the building, stoutly determines on going to no more than a certain moderate expenditure, which he then calculates as equal to the uttermost parts of his undertaking, and therefore he resolves to remain unvarying by the original plan laid and approved on for the structure; yet in spite of such determination, long ere the dwelling is under roof, unconsciously, he has proceeded to place innumerable additional comforts to his first design, whose necessity hath become apparent as the fabric grew under his sight and care, so that long before the whole is completed, he finds it difficult to recognize a feature of his first design, and is surprised that unawares he should have been so widely led astray from the mark 14* which he had placed as his boundary. Even with a feeling akin to this, is this one of the last books of this erratic narrative commenced—for when I look back to the matter already concluded, there is to be found, it must be confessed, not much that follows the early conception; and a wonder arises, how the limits, fixed as impassable on the rude threshold of the plot, at its dawn have been so strangely, and perhaps unadvisedly, overstepped. Yet so it is; at commencing, a plain straight forward route had been penciled, from which it appeared as if there could be no departure; but the following was clear and without an obstacle; still, numberless times has this high road been wandered from, seemingly almost without the slightest reason; matters that one scarcely thought of treating on, have crowded themselves on the canvass; characters whom it was proper to have kept in the back ground, but for occasional use, have taken up the principal portion of the picture; and in many places more hath been done, and in others, much less than could have been wished; and so it is, that now I am fully aware that there is enough to do in accomplishing the most critical point of my task, I mean the putting a last finish—the smoothing of rough ends, and making whole all broken shreds and the like, caused by such rash procedure in the work, which may now be resembled not unaptly, to some gallant bark with rent canvass and torn tackling dangling in the wind, after the wild tempest hath swept over her. “And who is to blame except yourself, for the trouble you may anticipate—for might not even more difficulties than there are in reality, have been expected, and with good cause, from the manner which without rhyme, reason, or any advice whatsoever, you have headstrong pursued in the developement of the facts of this strange history?” methinks some sour tongued and scowling reader, who intends to play the critic adverse and morose, exclaims, while he peevishly turns over the leaves, having looked at them with a stern resolve to be displeased and find fault, and now eagerly snaps at an opportunity, hat his ire may have vent, “was it not,” quoths he in continuance, “to be supposed that such would be the event, when whole pages have been dragged out with drawling insipidities, which, with perverse obstinacy, the inditer misconceives, misled with affectation and conceit, thinking them excellent witticisms—he therefore presumes they are advantageous to the world, and beget a favourable opinion of the profoundness of his reflections, and his views of mankind—and under this gross mistake, the whole force of his story, if he has any, has been destroyed by abrupt departures from its interest, to thrust on the impatient ear of the peruser, spiteful complaints against the fashion of existing manners; doubtless all this may appear to him wondrous wise as well as censorious, but he should remember that it has been remarked, with some truth, that many writers have supposed themselves very deep, when they were most superficial; and forsooth, what entitles him to decry every body and every thing, that comes within the range of his pen? does this self constituted guardian of morals, believe himself more pure than his fellows, or does he suppose he renders himself the more conspicuous and worthy of public attention by such unmeasured attacks? If so, he is widely in error—for take my word for it, and it is seldom I mistake, that he is presumptuous, in undertaking to weary the reader with his sarcastic remarks on human frailty—for who takes up a book but for an hour's amusement, to wile away the ennui of the day, that hangs heavy on his hands? and there is not one of a thousand, who may look into these pages, if they have the fortune to have so many readers, who care one atom what is of evil or good effect in society; for of a surety, each one in these hard times, has sufficient to attend to his own concerns, without the trouble of such matters; for there are few proverbs truer than the one which teaches, that which is the business of all, is no one's affair; and who is such a fool as to think of any one except himself, now-a-days? Philanthropy is a good standing subject for conversation, but its practice is entirely out of the question—for it is the modern maxim of wisdom, that each one use his fellow for his own interest, and get all he can from him, and then trample the victim, or rather idol, who hath submitted to the purposes of cunning that were worked on him, in the dust without remorse: truly our lovers of mankind are men of sense; there is nothing which comes in their way, but they derive benefit from— —— And out o' th' richest fruit With thirsty lips, draw forth its blood, its juice, Its ripeness, and its very life; and then, Like some noxious herb, the flagged and empty Skins, do cast aside for swine to revel on. But even for the sake of argument, master author, admitting your motives are good, what substantial influence do you believe your railing will tend to have on the conduct of the world? you are very vain an you suppose it will better it one jot. Your experiment is not new— it has been tried by better men heretofore, and what avails it—not the tythe of a hair; and I repeat to you, it is your part to learn wisdom, you must submit as others have done, to circumstances, which are not in the power of any mortal to control, or in the least to restrict— things will be even as they are—not a giant's hand were it to sweep and strew death like the poisonous blast of an eastern samul, above the congregated herds of sharpers, rogues, and villains that infest, or rather flourish in society, could succeed in driving vice from the human mind: for ere its task were more than begun, it would tire and give over in despair at the vain attempt; for like the ranks of some numerous army, as one squadron bites the dust from adverse ball and steel, new files succeed, closing each vacant space as though such had never been—even so, to every knave who repents or gives up business, there are a dozen successors ready to take the ground he leaves, and improve on his knaveries. So peace, sapient sir, for you are biting like a madman doth his chain, your teeth meet iron—therefore desist in time, and give us the fate of Leisler at once, without such preludes—a continuance of which there is in your manner an augury.” As a very oracle and with truth, I must admit, sagacious disciple of Longinus, hast thou spoken; and as I give ear to your discourse, greatly am I inclined to adopt your last advice. Yet there clings to me a few words which I beg your patience on, as perforce they conquer every resolution that I form to restrain them, and will forth; and whether they refute your remarks, you must judge. “Nay, hold for mercy's sake, master author, I yawn already at the thought of the vituperation that is gathering around your pen and standish. I will allow all you are going to say as truth—it is the best way to get rid of your incorrigible sophisms—for you have an answer at all times; yet I will say assuredly your pictures are many times the very copies of nature. But have pity on yourself if not on me; remember the famous Annibal Caracci beheld his noblest works despised, neglected, and discountenanced, for no other cause than that they were faithful portraitures of creation, while his pupils Guido and Carravagio succeeded, by following the advice given in their master's despondency, of outraging all they attempted to represent, to please the taste and whims of their patrons. And let me inquire what painter would be so mad, so envious, of losing every customer and admirer, as to draw the pimples on the nose of a debauchee, or the freckles on the cheeks of some would-be beauty, or deliver himself up to the eternal enmity, and tea-table scandal of some antiquated dame, whose finer feelings he has wounded, by placing every line of age, even to the bristles on the chin upon his canvass; and what would become of the fairest specimens of his skill, the lines on which he labored in expectation of fame for whole hours, for days, while light could guide his pencil—the garret dust and decay would be their lot, while the unfortunate artist would of course, meet contempt and starvation; so be warned.” Nay, wise sir, you know me not, if you suppose the course I might care to undertake, was one from which I am easily frightened, or that a moment's concern would be felt by me, from what might be said by the self appointed, and undisputed judges of literature, the magnates of the day, who suspect in their own belief, that when they have indited an unread paragraph, increasing the native dullness of some leaden journal, or after they have contributed to render the pages of some abortive review yet more stupid, by the barren efforts of their paltry brains, that they have done that which has called towards themselves, the sole attention of the world; and are installed as the arbiters of public opinion, and have thereby a licence to run down their betters, as well as to be the leaders in societies of arts or sciences, in which they are ignorant. In truth it is amusing to behold the freaks of such contemptible things, who infest the walks of literature; with what brazen assurance they push themselves forward, unmindful of their senseless and empty heads. Here are a host of them, directors of a national or city institution, for the encouragement or exhibition of the works of the followers of Raphael and Vandyke, not one of whom ever held a brush or pencil in their hands, nor are equal scarcely to judge the difference between a master-piece of Rubens' and a publican's sign; there are others of the same class, if not the self same personages, (for a pretension to universal knowledge is the fashion) lecturing, and delivering discourses on every species of learning, and philosophy, to simpering and delighted things who term themselves the patterns of fashion—the aristocracy of the day; who listen with the same advantage and instruction to the unnatural squallings of a foreign charlatan, in a tongue that not one out of a hundred of them understands; although it would be ungenteel to acknowledge their ignorance, and they therefore pretend delight,—as well as to the motley undigested, unformed nonsense, the skimmings of insignificance, that hovers on the lips of some conceited ape called a professor—of what truly except of vanity, it is hard to determine, unless a pair of spectacles or some such foppery, to assist youthful eyes, entitles one to the station, in spite of the manners of a coxcomb and the stupidity of an ass. And it is these, and such as these, who upheld by self sufficiency, and an unquenchable thirst for notoriety, render ludicrous and contemptible, the associations whose ostensible object should be that of improvement, but which are made subservient to the private ends of needy adventurers, or to show off the sterile intellect and conceit of some undaunted pretender, envious of having his name in print; so it matters not what branch of knowledge, however abstruse or foreign from his own calling, in which he mingles;—even the meetings of horticulturists are crowded with psuedo physicians, flippant lawyers, paltry merchants, and presuming conductors of heavy journals, a varied group among whom it is a chance if there is one who knows the difference between a spade or a rake, an artichoke or a cabbage; and whose only object in usurping characters, the qualifications for which they are by no means acquainted with, is a greedy avarice of public attention, which is apparently the more powerful in the human mind, the more narrow and confined the intellect; for it is remarkable, folly believes itself the more admired and akin to wisdom, the more it is exposed. Yet though this be known and acknowledged, the evil has a certain influence, and so preposterous is the mania, that to secure the success of some new invention, the mechanic or manufacturer deems it prudent to propitiate the recommendation of these leaders of opinion: for the crowd, brow-beaten by their haughty airs of superiority, have silently endured their arbitrary dictation; while it is common to rely on, and boast of the certificate of its usefulness and perfection, from some noisy divine, or shallow votary of Galen, ere the universal adoption of a new discovery, whether it be for the sawing of logs, the making of nails or pins, or the curing of a smoky chimney; nevertheless, this absurdity might not call for reprobation, were the actors guided in the least by principle or disinterestedness—but it is in most instances too palpable, that if by accident they serve the public essentially, they have intended but to feed their avarice or their vanity, without the slightest regard for social or moral duty; nay, without the least sense of that obligation which man owes to his fellow or his Maker; and however worthless the objects of those passports of public patronage—however false, paltry or insignificant, their intrinsic composition, the easier is it to obtain advecates,—no quackery, be it ever so wretched and liable to detection, if the proper methods be taken by securing the selfish praise of some petty and venal press, but may be eminently successful in its imposition—and this latter, the press, is the most subservient tool in being at the time—ready to serve the purposes of any one, without the least deference as to the honour, honesty, or the licentiousness of the cause it espouses, according to the directions of the master of those who conduct it: with the vilest inconsistency, it is ready to defame or laud any man or measure—and however steady for a day it may appear, however firm and determined its course for an hour, yet, like the grave looking demagogue of Athens, who roared in every assembly of the people against the increasing power of the Macedonian, the sooner it may be looked for to change its sentiments—the sooner it will be corrupted—for like some starved hound, gazing at other dogs revelling in an enclosure in which it is unable to break on the kitchen offals, the more envious it is— the more hungry its maw—the fiercer its barking—but like the quadruped, it is but desirous of a bone to stop its mouth;—and so is it with all, no matter what the degree, or the station, all are for sale, all are to be bought; and of too much truth is the line of the Roman orator, “Fit enim deterior qui accipit atque ad idem semper expectandem paratior.”—And although fortune may be likened to a fickle courtesan, yet like such, her love and favours are for the highest bidder, without respect to qualifications or worth; and though many times accident or caprice may raise the most unfit to stations whereto their stupidity folly and vice gives disgrace,—still, too often bribery is the only stepping stone to elevation and office. Indeed from the prevalent spirit of the day, one is led unawares into a reflection many times, similar to that treated on by Machiavel, in the first book of his Discourses, “whether, when the people have grown corrupt, a free government can be maintained, if they enjoy it,” and which he concludes is impossible—and that a corrupt people, whom moderate laws cannot correct, can only be restrained and bound, by enforcing severe edicts by arbitrary power.— Day awoke with heavy, languid and wintry light, above the scene of the late tumult, and calm seemed o'er the city succeeding the tempest, that, but a short time before, had shook with alarm to its most distant quarters; the usual hour, when the busy and stirring citizen crowded the streets, had passed; an uncommon silence and desertion pervaded, even in the places often most frequented; the mechanic and the labourer, though at the first breaking of the dawn, they had sprang from their pallets and hastily attired themselves as wont, yet paused ere they went forth unto their daily toils of life, in strange and timid uncertainty; it appeared as if a feeling of conscious guilt hung over all, and each man feared to gaze upon his neighbour, lest in the countenance he looked on, he should read the detestation and horror painted in his own heart; with stealthy pace, and uneasy mind, the burgher stole forth—and here and there as the hours journeyed on, at some remote spots in the city, were gathered small and anxious groups, among whom, discourse on the events of the past night was busy, and was carried on in low and fearful whispers; the rashness that had been displayed, was commented on, and an indefinite terror filled the breasts of those who listened to the relations of the fray which was varied by every narrator, of what would succeed, or in what manner the massacre of Milbourne and the others, might be viewed; rumours and tales, disjointed and mutilated, were on every lip—while those who, either more courageous or inquisitive than their fellows, had ventured earlier to approach the front of the Stadthuis, which had been the chief scene of the bloody drama, and had lingered to examine the lacerated and torn strips of flesh strewed around, that had been but awhile before a portion of a human body, and which, though trodden in the mud and snow, were easily distinguished by spots of blood frozen by the morning air, and were handled with a revolting Vol. II. 15 touch, had returned, and brought with them accounts of the cruel butchery that had been committed, that made the hearts of those who questioned thereon, thrill with horror and wonder, at the extent of rage to which they had been transported: suspense, as well as inquietude, now followed, and for a time prevailed over the mind of each apprehensive citizen; for that day, a change appeared to have been made in the ordinary habits of the city; customary occupations and pursuits were abandoned; few stalls of trade were opened; the bosoms of men struggled between fear and hope, and those who remained not in the solitude of their houses in mournful rumination, sought out their neighbours, to communicate with them on all the night had witnessed, and to deprecate the event; but this lasted not long—as the day wore onwards, the signal of the city bell announced the arrival of the hour at which the magistrates were used to hold their sittings for the committal and punishment of ordinary offenders, and for the conservation of the city's peace, summarily award the wooden horse, the cucking stool, the gallows, the transport ship, or the stake. At the sound, as if moved by one impulse, every step sought the Stadthuys, and every inquiring eye was bent towards its walls; and though there might have been some, who on their way thither, trod reckless by the stains of crime and death that lay in their path, yet more than one involuntarily shuddered at the sight as he hurried past, and it was not long, ere a vast multitude of anxious burghers had thronged within the portals of the building, or with troubled visages strove for entrance from the steps of the stoeb. And the planks laid across the ditch or schroeinge, in front of the Stadthuys, were filled with those who endeavoured, by frequent calls on the more fortunate in advance of their position, to learn such information as might be obtained from the burgomasters. Mention hath been heretofore made of the structure, within which the incidents of the narrative are about to lead; nevertheless a peculiar description of its outward appearance will not here be deemed out of place, nor uninteresting to readers of an age so famed for improvements in architecture as the one we live in; for the Stadthuys of Nieuw Amsterdam was of all the edifices that adorned that ancient city, the one on which it might pride itself the most, being a very model of buildings of the kind, on a plan at once ample and convenient, and worthy of the spirit by which it had been raised: it was in front of three stories high, composed of neat Dutch brick, well plaistered and put together with lime mortar made of oyster shells dragged in the waters of Kill van Kull, and which had of old been preferred from the best Holland lime by that judicious personage, Mienheer Kieft, who had made repeated experiments of its merit, in the erection of numerous public edifices, with which during his administration he had graced the metropolis of the Nieuw Nederlandts; indeed the stadthuis was itself on the scite of one of the old Dutch governor's structures, and occupied the ground on which had stood the famous stadt-herberg, or city tavern, whereon the liberal and munificent Hollander had expended at once all the taste and treasure of invention of his ingenious mind; for if the historian hath done Kieft justice, he must have been a stout little Dutchman, of magnificent and stupendous ideas, which were laid out to admirable purpose, in the zeal with which he straitened the crooked streets, demolished the ancient public buildings, and raised on their ruins stately piles of wood and stone, which were long the boast of the burghers of Nieuw Amsterdam; in truth Kieft was the Palladio of the colony, and it is with satisfaction perceived some little of his spirit of improvement has been caught in these days, the effects of which, were he alive, would make the thrifty Nederlander start in wonder and delight; for now the desire of being busy as well as that of splendor, and of changing Nieuw Amsterdam into a second Athens, that filled the bosom of the emulous Kieft, exists with powerful influence, and urges forward the varied municipal additions, which keep in motion both the minds of our city rulers and the money of the citizens, in the laying out, running, and widening of highways, the levelling of old houses, and the erection of new ones, and of pulling down in every quarter, each small and comfortable building for the sake of raising in their steads tall ungainly heaps of brick, which are so slightly laid as to threaten daily to topple on their inhabitants; but indeed there can be no better example of the excellence of a sway immediate from the people, than is used in effecting the first of these, the opening of streets and squares, the original design of which mostly is awakened in the reflective brain of some sapient member of the City Council, who, having property badly situated, takes on himself to increase its value and make his fortune, (which, by the by, is but right, seeing his municipal services are rendered without pay,) by making some new street through the grounds of his neighbours to his own advantage and to the destruction both of their comforts and residences; at the same time smoothing the hurt and injury done, by the cries of hirelings who have been promised pay, from contracts of digging paving, or building at the public expense, and who therefore preach up the benefits of the improvement, so that the unfortunate man whose ground increases in value from these causes, has to pay for the expected good more than is allowed for what is taken from him, and twice that which he can obtain for what is left, which, on being forced to abandon in despair, falls into the hands of some worthy burgomaster for little or nothing, while its original possessor is a ruined man by the very means he was promised to have made a mint of wealth: and while such consequence follows the one, the others keep up a continual commotion of noise and dust, filling the eyes and spoiling the coats of all who pass such spots, as where the shallow pomp and empty vanity of some purse proud knave sprang from the stable or the cow yard, the amasser of riches by chance and roguery rather than deserts, raises a palace for his office or his dwelling. But as to the stadthuis of Nieuw Amsterdam;—at the era of the narrative, it was an entire new mansion, and in its erection neither expense nor talent had been spared as befitted a lordly Dutch city; in truth, if confidence is to be placed in the register of the day, and the receipts as recorded of the city collector, Baruche Judah, are accurate, and the contrary is not to be presumed, no less a sum than four hundred pounds, seawant value, was assessed on the groodt und kleiner Burgerrecht of New Yorke for the purpose, every one paying in proportion to his property and wealth; his honour Colonel Frederick Phillipse, contributing as became his high standing and superior riches, seventeen shillings and sixpence, wampum peague, a sum at once enormous for one man, liberal and magnificent as should be remembered to the praise of the donor:[16] [16] Vide City Records, 1699; and the return of Baruche Judah, as registered. possessed of such large and ample means to commence the grand undertaking, before the corner stone was laid, the committee of Burgomasters, to whose care the matter had been committed, sat in profound dubitation and council upon the numerous draughts and plans, that from every corner of the province had been showered on them for acceptance; indeed a reward had been offered for the one that should please, and there was not an architect in the Nieuw Nederlandts, but who strove for the prize, and as may be supposed, the variety for choice exceeded all measure, from copies of every noble structure boasted of in der Vaderlandt, to the tall spired Indian pagoda. Long and doubtful was the deliberation ere a decision was made, for such was the precise and judicious taste that guided the burgomasters, that scarce any thing that was presented to them, could satisfy their fastidious desires of perfection, and indeed it is a chance, if their opinion had been ever settled, although they smoked much, and drank deep during the consultation, had it not been for the pre-eminent genius of burgomaster Outhout, to whom posterity must ever remain indebted; for with sagacious skill, after having turned over all the papers, he seized on the uppermost one, being the nearest at hand, and declared with a round hollandsche oath, that “dat vash der ding vor hish bleazure mit zome liddle dalderazion dat he mould make in a minute,” and his sage opinion was agreed to without dispute; however the alterations to which the sapient burgomaster referred, were submitted to his judgment entirely, as all were well aware they would not in the burgomaster's hand increase the expenditure: indeed, if possible his determination was to diminish it, without hurt to the beauty of the intended 15* building, which stood many years a monument of his wisdom; for although the composition of the model, was in all points in proportion, yet desirous of saving a few guilders of the public money, with honest Dutch thriftiness, he curtailed it of one third of its breadth; he likewise sunk the first story and raised the second, so that it might in somewise, resemble a tall man mounted on the shoulders of a small one; and as he verily shuddered with affright when he computed the immense cost of brick which must have been imported from Holland, to finish the whole building, he bethought himself of an excellent device, that as the rear of the edifice looked on the rasp huis, the cellar kitchen of which was kept by vrouw Burger, it mattered not of what the same was composed. The front therefore of the structure was only brick, painted a flaming dutch yellow, at once brilliant and costly, while the other part of the building was of a rough brown stone, without color or finish whatsoever, so that the Stadt-huis might be compared to a vestcoat, very fine in front, but common behind. Nevertheless although burgomaster Outhout, was lauded long and loudly, for such excellent procedure, and acquired more fame thereby, than any of his name, since first they had emigrated from Schenkenshaus, in Betuwe on the Waal, where his ancestry had drove a respectable trade in the cod fishery, on the dogger bank, on occupying the edifice, some little inconvenience it must be admitted was encountered, which however, it was impossible to lay to the burgomaster's restrictions, there being in some places a want of light, and in others too much thereof, some rooms being huge, long and large, with ceilings, against which the voice made no sound, but dissipated as it were in the open air, a grievous thing for weak lunged orators, while others were so small and cut up, that there was scarce doing any thing with them;—all this gave rise and food to envy, from the rival and disappointed architects, and as may be surmised, they strove to hit off some tart jokes against the noble building at the cost of their successful comate, who however, as the latter was justly entitled to, laid all the honor to the door of the burgomaster, and even it is said, in the offervescence of his admiration, shared the best part of the reward for the model with that sapient and puissant dignitary, which if true, does credit to the proper sense, in which the worthy burgomaster's talents were estimated, and puts to defiance all the sarcasms of enemies; one of whom Peiter Mesier, a runaway bookeverkooper, or bookseller's apprentice, from Hammerkin in the low countries, a sorry wag, who presumed on an acquaintance with classic lore, having once held the bridle of the mule rode by Thomas a Kempis, (who lived in his neighborhood, on the river Aa, between Yssel and Vecht,) it is rumored, had the audacity, in the presence of Mienheer William Jannewaaye, der milkmensch, (on whom however the spleen lost effect, for he was a dotard, ignorant, hardheaded crone, awake only to the gathering of pelf, scarce knowing how to read or write,) to compare the stadthuis of the Nieuw Nederlandts, and the mighty, sapient, puissant, and disinterested personages concerned in its superstructure, to the raising of the famous Town Hall, of Scheldterbergsh, in Allemagne, of which his story ran thus. The Scheldterbergers being desirous of raising a magnificent city building, and having set about it in earnest, soon completed a structure at no little cost to themselves, and the neighbouring cities, who contributed thereto, the whole being under the direction of one the greatest architects, the Scheldterbergsh could produce. The exterior of the edifice was finished to the admiration of all who gazed on it; crowds rushed in the interior to view it, but what was their surprise on entering the council chamber, to find it dark as midnight, so that they bumped against each other's shins and noses at a terrible rate, and with dolorous execution; the reason of this phenomenon set them all in amaze—while the truth was this—the chief builder being a man wide awake to his own interest, and a certain sum being allowed for the work, had argued arithmetically, that one window would do for at least four, and by putting in one in the place of four, the expense and cost of three would be clear profit to him; however, finding the wise men of Scheltderbergsh somewhat crusty at the explanation he was forced to make, he told them that if they considered the want of light an evil, it was easily remedied—that they had but to get large bags and open them in the sun, and they could catch as much light as they wished; the idea took, and every bag in the city was in requisition: this difficulty being got over, a new one sprung up—owing to the crowd of great men living at Scheldterbergsh, there was, on putting each man in his place of state, found to be a want of room, which caused a grievous complaint, and was a drawback on the boast of the architect of the hall, which was intended to serve for ages, and also a great disadvantage to the city; for those who could not get room in the edifice, withdrew to a neighbouring tavern in a great huff, and whether owing to liquor, or the choler natural to their being almost ejected from the building, fell at loggerheads with such fury that it was feared they might pull off each other's ears: the council of Scheldterbergsh being thereon greatly disturbed, took the matter in consideration; whereon it was moved and acceded to, that an antidote to their troubles should be tried, by putting in force an ingenious contrivance suggested by the architect, whom the matter had so intimately concerned;—he proposed that the Scheldterbergers being in the interior, should place their backs against the walls and push them out, thereby enlarging the building so as to receive all persons, to whom place therein should be given; whereupon, with grievous grunting, groaning, labouring, and sweating, they set to—but after a long trial, they could not perceive they had made progress in their enterprise, and were about to become enraged against the proposer and proposal, but he requesting their patience, advised all to divest themselves of their cloaks, and spread them at the foot of the walls on the outer side; which being done and the attempt renewed, the architect slily carried away the offcast garments, while the Scheldterbergers coming out and seeing them gone, set up a loud shout of success, supposing they had pushed the walls so as to cover their cloaks and hide them under the foundation. Now Mienheer Mesier applied this veritable high German story to be a right allegory, and in point;—the cunning architect and builder being easily divined, while the gulled Scheldterbergers were plainly the Nieuw Amsterdammers, equally taken with the fabrications and deceit of every rogue who chose to make his fortune from the public folly, and ever ready to become the dupes of any artifice, however palpable or absurd, which wily and designing knaves may offer as a bait for them to swallow; withal, however, its flaming and shining hue, the Stadthuys of Nieuw Amsterdam was a heavy and sombre building, with a huge, tall, tiled roof, and small dark prison-looking windows, the pediments of which were of stone—and in the uppermost story, which served as a gaol, garnished with gratings and stanchells of iron. Following the course from the outward gate, which was now wide open, but which, when closed, was usually secured by strong bars and bolts, and a chain which led across it on the inside, the crowd thronged through the huge hall of the edifice, the walls of which were rough and unplaistered in many places, and green with damp as the sides of a dungeon, being cheerless and naked, except where they were garnished with hangings of iron fetters, and uncouth implements of torture, interspersed with weapons of war, arquebusses, pistolets and partuizans of antique make and form; and made their way to a low and arched entrance, before which, stood two civil officers with tall staffs, who, nearly in vain, strove to distinguish those to allow admission,—and endeavoured to drive back, with all the mightiness of authority, the commoner herd, who pushed upon them in despite of threats and commands. Indeed the consciousness of the possession of power, however limited and contemptible, like that of riches, inflates the mind to a forgetfulness of every thing except its own mightiness— and a person, who, but a day gone by, met and greeted you cordially as an equal, be he advanced only to the shadow of dignity beyond his former state, thinks a cold nod of contemptuous indifference sufficient, if even he cares so far to recognize his former intimate or associate. This feeling, judging from the appearance, seemed peculiarly to inhabit the breasts of the two guardians of the door that opened in the apartment, wherein sat some of the lordly magistracy of New-Yorke, for the crossing of the threshold, from the anxiety manifested to pass it, rather increased than diminished by the opposition made thereto, which was evidently a matter of moment to the burghers, which was the more apparent, when after a severe and warm contention of crowding, pushing, jostling, tramping, kicking, plunging, shouldering and shoving on both sides, during which, in despite of vigilance or exertion, here and there an agile fellow, with an eely slide would elude all caution, and slip from the herd of his less fortunate companions, into the apartment; an interval, or rather breathing space of mastery, was obtained by the puissant keepers of the door way, over those who claimed admittance—during which, the greetings and epithets of kindness, that were showered from the lips of petitioners on the officers, were innumerable although nugatory, and served merely to increase their obdurity, by swelling their opinions of their own self importance: this was more peculiarly evident in the conduct of one of them, a short thick man, with a black surly visage, that resembled a cross-grained muzzled mastiff, and who, to the numerous calls on his acquaintance and remembrance, was as deaf as a beetle, and with a coarse growl, bid all keep back—although this bearish consequence was often dropped to servile humility, whenever his eye singled out a person struggling in the crowd whom he supposed of more power than himself, and for whose benefit, he exerted himself straightway to make room,—and this last conduct was also followed, whenever any one was ingenious enough to slip a schilling in his hand unperceived, and who, whatever were his disadvantages, quickly was preferred before all that might have stood in precedence before him. But now for the interior of the room thus strictly guarded: it was long and vaulted, with a stone floor, and massive benches of the same material, placed in rows from the wall, of which every seat was fast receiving an occupant, while the apartment itself was filling to an overflow: at the upper end, the room was divided by a short railing, on the farther side of which, were on one part, large yokes of plank or stocks for confining criminals, by which stood several ragged and meanly attired men and women, who, by their miserable and squalid looks, for in some, there was a singular mixture of hardihood and unconcern, while others, with anxious eye and pale cheek, gazed about with fearful, uncertain and wandering glances, were persons, expecting either to undergo trial or judgment. These were attended by soldiers of the hofdt wagt: on the part opposite to that last described, were two forms or benches, the one raised higher, and beyond the other: on the latter was seated, in all the pomp and pride of a judge, Dirk Van Rikketie—while on either side of him were placed, in monstrous arm chairs of the brightest mahogany, burgomasters Gelyn Verplancke and Filkins: the seats on the other, and lower bench, were filled with the officers of the court, the king's attorney, public notaries, auditors, common or town clerk, court messenger or crier, and various other attendants on whom it was a duty to be present at the burgomasters hof; while the large apartment was rendered comfortable to its numerous sojourners by a fire of blocks and billets of wood, which roared, blazed and ascended with smoke and flame, up a huge tunnel, the mouth of which was large enough to accommodate the greatest log cut by the woodman. In the situation he was now placed, Dirk Van Rikketie greatly was delighted, and was apparently at perfect ease: indeed it was proverbial that he loved the very stench of the apartment—for as the principal of those who were brought before him were negroes, Indians, or the lowest sweepings of the whites, the word in the dog days, though vulgar, was not misapplied—and now he looked on the crowd before him with exquisite complaisance, and now he whispered some joke to his sapient associates, who grinned in return with solemn shakes of the head, and looked wondrous wise and edified at his sallies. The anxiety that stirred the populace was not unknown to Dirk, nor did he feel adverse to gratifying their curiosity as far as he was able, neither did he deem it prudent for him to let slip an opportunity wherein he could please the crowd, and show by words his devotedness to the new order of affairs that had commenced in the colony—therefore, as soon as the crier had finished, and the common clerk, who was a shock headed, queer, and testy looking little Frenchman, a huegonot emigrant ftom Provence, had proclaimed the court in session, having first advised in a whisper with the burgomasters beside him, in which consultation Dirk Van Rikketie was the only speaker, those he communicated with, nodding wisely an assent to all he advanced, possibly fearful of words, lest they should commit themselves in ignorance, in dispute with so learned a jurist, Dirk addressed the burghers in hearing. First he spoke sadly and mournfully on the distraction of the times—the horrors of civil war, and the distressing length to which party spirit had been carried,— `the woful tragedy that had so lately happened,' he said, was much to be regretted—and yet he could not help thinking that the two rash and unfortunate men, from their turbulence, and the insolent manner with which they had demeaned themselves towards his excellencie the governor, (whom the lord preserve for many years to rule over the province of New-Yorke) had met a fate, though a dreadful one, which they deserved, seeing, if they had survived, they could only have been considered as attainted traitors: secondly, their majesties, in their sovereign goodness, had sent over to govern the colony, a man possessing every virtue under heaven; a pious man—an honourable man—a merciful man—yea, for his, (the speaker's part) he had long, by reputation, been acquainted with the good name of colonel Sloughter, for an honest fame was sweet smelling and savoury, like a herb of perfume—and he had heard of the govenor's name across the far waters, long ere he had beheld his benignant face; and he was ready to vouch, a better man than his excellency, did not exist—nay, breathed not in Europe or America; for well he could foresee, that under his government, peace and happiness was not only to be restored, but to reign perennial; the province would be a land flowing with milk and honey, and the envy of every other colony on the sea board; and what was not the ancient enemy, the Canadian, to fear, from the prowess of his arm already? As they heard his name, they trembled—and the Count De Frontenac knew his conqueror. Heaven grant his excellency many years of life, to fulfil all his promise.' Then he strenuously exhorted all good citizens, to be firm in their allegiance to their highnesses the king and queen, and to assist to the uttermost in all he might be pleased to undertake, his excellencie, their distinguished subject, the governor of the loyal colony of New-Yorke: and thirdly, he informed them, that their excellent and worthy fellow citizens, Colonel Nicholas Bayard, and master Walter Nichols, had been set at liberty, and rescued unharmed, from the dungeons in which they had been so vilely detained by the wicked and turbulent partizans of Jacobus Leisler, and had been restored to all the powers, offices, and emoluments which they formerly held, and which said the speaker, I pray they may long enjoy, and lastly his excellencie the Governor, in supreme goodness, mercy, justice and wisdom, had ordered a commission of Oyer and Terminer, to be issued to Sir Thomas Robinson, Colonel Smith, himself, Dirk Van Rikketie, and other judicial authorities, for the trial on charges of rebellion, against their leige sovereigns King William and Queen Mary, of the said Jacobus Leisler, Pieter De Lanoy, and their adherents, who were now in close confinement, in the very building in which the Court was sitting, `and though the lord forfend that he should say, that he believed any man guilty before he was so adjudged, yet he would venture to affirm in such case an they were convicted, he for himself would vouch, and he had no doubt of the honorable and worthy gentleman joined with him, that although their duty might be a painful and really distressing one, considering the ties of citizenship, and intimacy, which bound them to the culprits, yet it would be firmly performed, without regard to any thing except strict justice, for it was a maxim with him, the greater the convict, the greater should be the example.' This gracious and important communication being ended, in the course of which, Dirk had ex Vol. II. 16 pressed sentiments that were diametrically opposite to those on his lips but the day before, but which were now the most profitable and reigning opinions, and therefore he espoused them; the throng was somewhat thinned, many dispersing to retail to their expectant acquaintances, that which they had heard from the veracious tongue of the geheim Schryveir, though others remained, withheld by curiosity, while the court pursued their ordinary business. There was sentencing of greedy tavern keepers, who in despite of law had supplied supper parties of jovial dutchmen, after the ringing of the bell, or who had made some thirsty half bred Indian drunk, although the council had passed an edict against such conduct, and allowed the word of the savage when sober, as conclusive evidence against the criminal, who had dared to contravene the statute, by giving him food for “beastlinesse;”[17] [17] Vid. Records of the Nieuw Nederlandts. there were riotous sailors who had been in the holy land, and creating disturbances with peaceable burghers, had drawn their knives on the patrouille, who had been called to quell the riot; these were condemned to throw themselves three times each one, from the sail yard of the yacht to which they belonged, and receive from each fellow mariner on board, three lashes apiece. There were also matters wherein the judge's discrimination and decision were more widely exercised, some of these were cases in which the delict had been informed against, for eluding the spirit and letter of the laws made for public security and welfare, as where an adventurous swine, the property of a griping old fellow called Hauns Pieterse, had strayed into the kitchen garden of burgomaster Bresier, and cropped all the best of his cabbages; whereupon the burgomaster became so worth, he being a mighty lover of good eating, and passionately fond of cabbages, that he seized upon the fourlegged offender, and had him impounded, against which proceeding Pieterse appealed;-whereon after maturely hearing the point in controversy, judgment was given thus equitable, that as Pieterse it appeared was not fit to keep hogs, the porker was forfeited, and ordered to be sold at the next fair, and the proceeds of his sale, to be divided proportionately, half to the justices, and half to the informer, the said burgomaster Bresier, and the “konstabel” were commanded to pay the costs. Numerous indeed were the admirable constructions and illustrative definitions of the jurisprudence of the province propounded and pronounced by the sapient Dirk Van Rikketie, and acceded to by his no less wise and erudite associates, in the many similar causes which came before them. Now, although the statute laws of the colony in themselves were at this time few, and (as might be supposed from perusal) easy of being understood, being that singular code well known to the antiquarian by the title of “The Duke's laws,” yet nevertheless, while these were in some sort the common law of the land, the members of the colonial assembly and the burgomasters of the city were daily, in their discreet wisdom, drafting and publishing edicts after their own sovereign will, which natheless unmeant by them, went in direct contravention to the “Jus novæ eboracensis;” whereby, two opposite ordinances being in equal force, a criminal was condemned by one, and cleared for the same misdemeanour by the other; so, doing little help to either morals, justice, or to the community. And when, after having done incalculable service to wealthy and powerful rogues, and having been the bane or death of every poor vagabond who was unable from want of money to bribe fortune, (for that reigns above right or wrong, and to it justice is subservient;) a dead set was perhaps made to remedy the evil by passing some amendment to the original form of the act: but as most opportunely for the well being of society, the honest men whose unthankful duty it behoves to enact laws have generally less care to make them perfect than the rogue, whose chief study it has always been to find some hole in the labour, of which he may avail himself—the matter of complaint by such new consideration was often rendered worse; and so the thing was necessary to be again and again reviewed, but seldom to any better purpose. Although the acts themselves would have scarce filled a diminutive volume, yet their additions made ponderous tomes; for indeed both resembled the will of some peevish old man with a large estate, who every day found cause to change the disposal of his property, and one hour makes a codicil, which in the next he destroys to make way for two others diametrically opposite to his former intention, and probably ere long both the last are revoked to make room for twice their number, varying the disposition of the hypochondriac's estate in a manner in which he is not a whit more satisfied. Now, as may be supposed, the confusion arising from the multiplicity of sub-edicts was the very element in which the sagacity, probity and acuteness of Dirk was pre-eminent; and the reader cannot be surprised from what he hath already read of the talents of this learned character, that the skill with which he thrided the labyrinth was at once superior and astonishing; in truth, no man living could apply the letter of the law so perfectly as he could; he knew well when the time was proper to impose a slight mulct, and when, for the self same infringement of the public peace, a severe corporal punishment ought to be inflicted; and withal, he was a merciful creature, imbued with the very milk of human kindness; for he was at all times ready to intercede for a pardon for the very vilest convict, if some influential man requested it of him. Indeed, the records of Nieuw Nederlandts are fraught with numberless examples of the geheîmschryver's virtues, for it was an invariable rule with him to correct all reports of causes that came before him, by erasing every thing that tended to interfere with the side of the question which in his wisdom it had pleased him to espouse; and no one can blame him therefor, seeing that iniquity and wickedness can present many times a plausible set of motives for action, which, as evil has more converts and followers than virtue, might (being given publicity) be tended with ill effects on minds in whom a neutrality as to the matter may have made but poor and uninterested judges; whereas the light in which Dirk had eyed the subject being showered on the public, it totally suppressed all murmurs of contradiction or condemnation of the course he had chosen; for Dirk was fully aware of the nature of mankind, and well knew no human work is so perfect as to please every body. An example of the rigorous, certain and unimpeachable manner in which Dirk construed the penal statutes of the colony was observable at the hour of the narrative, in the sentence which in conjunction with the puissant burgomasters who were at his elbow, he passed upon two certain offenders; considerable interest and attention had been excited on the occasion, and after burgomaster Breiser's and Hauns Peiterse's business was disposed of, there was a hum of expectation and conjecture among the crowd of hearers that thronged the apartment—Dirk's countenance became more solemn and important, and his two puissant supporters shook their heads with pompous gravity; while every understrapper of the court took the infection, and demeaned himself in accordance with the visages of his superiors. Now the fact, as appears from the chronicles yet extant, in the first case, was this:—there was one Jan Hobbes, of facetious memory, of whom a mention hath been heretofore slightly made, a meddlesome, scandalous fellow, given wonderfully to writing and making books, and therefore was considered a person of little consequence in the stadt, his calling being a mean trade and not allowed the city license as a freeman. Now Jan being of a mischievous nature and terribly discontented with the times, took on himself to prove that matters and things were not as they ought to have been, and that the lusty burghers of Nieuw Amsterdam had derogated from the honesty and virtue of their ancestors who had first founded the Dorp; and being misled by wrong advice, `and not,' as the tradition forcibly remarks, `having the fear of man and the law in his sight,' did most sacrilegiously and outrageously profane the people's ear with the unworthiness of certain friends of Dirk Van Rikketie. Now it must be apparent that nothing can be more libellous or disgusting to sense and feeling than for a dirty fellow to brush against our best attire and leave mud and stains upon us as he passes —or what can be more offensive than for a scavenger to shake his dirt and dust in our faces after we have just cleansed ourselves from impurity? `yet such were nothing,' saith the tradition, `compared to the acts of wilful Jan'— who without the least delicacy or remorse, such a har 16* dened creature was he, by the most indelicate allusions recalled to the minds of great men what they had been. `The horrid enormity thrills one with affright,' continues the sensitive writer of the chronicle; `hanging, the wooden horse, and the cucking stool, were all too little for such a wretch, who dared boldly tell the truth, even though he insulted the sacred presence of a burgomaster.' Now after this ebullition of rage and indignation, the chronicler goes into a learned dissertation on truth, wherein he concludes that to speak it to any man of influence or power is a most unpardonable aggression, and deserves the thumbscrew. Now Jan, although he ought to have known of the risk he was at of certain punishment for his crime, for had he tasked his memory he would have recollected how Hendrick Jansen, in the days of Wouter Van Twiller, was sentenced for scandalizing the governor to a heavy penalty, namely, to ride with face to the tail, behind the town crier, on a jackass through the principal streets, the libeller having a bridle in his mouth, a bunch of rods under his arm, and an appropriate label on his breast, and acknowledge that he lied falsely[18] [18] Records of Nieuw Nederlandts. “dat de exegellenge did niet wears rood broeks nor was grate mit hish plack frouw.” Neither was there anything of which, in his wickedness, Jan could be made to repent, for he was a stubborn sinner:—therefore Dirk off hand pronounced him guilty of all charges brought against him, considering it utterly unimportant that Jan should be heard at all in his defence; for what could any one say for himself that had perpetrated crimes so heinous—who had without compunction ridiculed the consequence of a warrior tailor, exposed the mock importance of sundry self-conceited magnificents, and laughed with irreverent scorn at the grave decorum and splendid attainments of divers spectacled and profound Dutch doctors and professors,—rendering by such derision of no avail the laborious endeavours of these puissant and sapient characters, to impress the minds of the burghers of the Nieuw Nederlandts with a high opinion of their vast erudition, ingenuity, and mightiness. Now it must be premised that Dirk well knew Jan Hobbes was not worth a groat, and therefore had but little chance of having over many influential characters step forward in his favour; yet at the bottom of his heart there lurked a latent fear that in case he enraged the satirist, he might turn his venom on him. `Although in such conclusion Dirk must have been deceived,' saith the Chronicle, `for no man, not even Jan Hobbes, could have been of so ruthless a disposition as to injure the fine and delicate feelings of an honourable man of the virtue, candour, good-nature, and perfect honesty and disinterestedness of Dirk Van Rikketie;'—howbeit the wisdom of Dirk was exercised in the matter, so that hereafter he might excuse himself to Jan. He therefore, well knowing the answer that would be received, inquired first of Burgomaster Filkins, his opinion whether or no it would be popular to send Jan to the Rasp huis, and quoted authorities therefor; as was to be expected, Filkins, although he thought the matter had better be made up, yet as he wanted Dirk to interest himself in getting the vroedschap to pass a law to widen a street where he held property, assented without refutation of Dirk's various arguments pro and con; and Burgomaster Gelyne, on Dirk's inquiry, bowed with grave dignity his head in acquiescence, he having been before the matter came up impressed against Jan by his comate burgomaster Ezel-een Mensch, the mortal foeman of the wicked satirist—so Dirk secure in shifting the blame from his own shoulders on that of his associates if any should be found, went on in decreeing the punishment of Jan Hobbes, with stern composure; after descanting largely and uncontradicted, Jan not being allowed a word, on the enormity of the offence, which was, as Dirk sublimely expressed it, with a significant annotation, worse than murder or robbery, for as the poet laid down, “he that steals my purse steals trash; but he that filches my good name, makes me poor indeed”—Dirk closed (however, first taking care to bestow one or two compliments on Jan's talents, as was his custom, to keep Jan in a good humour with himself,) by saying that the Court, in mercy to his poverty, had fined him a sum of money which he knew Jan was then unable to pay, therefore, in commutation of his fine, they committed him to the rasphuis until he could make the money to discharge the mulct, and as authority for such procedure, he drew profusely from the case of Baron Van Slightenhorst, the agent for the Patroon of Ranselearwyck, who having quarreled with Governor Stuyvesant, in the earlier day of the Nieuw Nederlandt, on some question of jurisdiction between that manor and the colony, was arrested and confined by the order of the testy old Dutchman at Nieuw Amsterdam on a charge of crimen lasæ majestatis, and heavily fined therefor, in a certain sum, but which, understanding he was ready to pay, having the money, the Court that condemned reconsidered their fiat, and doubled the amount of the mulct, the first being supposed no punishment, as he could discharge it, and on appeal from the last decree, the baron complained that neither himself nor friends were in any wise able to raise the required money, the Governor decided, that the baron should stay in prison till he could make it,[19] [19] Vid. Records of Nieuw Nederlandts, 1652. or until he begged his pardon, and got the Court to recommend him to mercy. The other delinquent that was brought before this incorruptible trio, was a noisy, vain, blustering blackguard, coxcomb of a fellow, the gossip of the town, a man whose veracity was as doubtful as his principles were bad: he was charged with theft, in stealing and breaking open a letter directed to a worthy burgher, in whose affairs he was somewhat curious, and with whose private business this convict was desirous of meddling and of exposing his secrets to the city; the matter was completely made out against the criminal, but he being an intimate of Dirk, this wise and irreproachable judge considered it proper, as he could not pass an impartial sentence on him, that the same should be postponed until he should leave the office of Geheim Schryveir, which might one day or the other come to pass, as he supposed, or otherwise until the last mentioned criminal should become his enemy, which might be the case in his espousing the wrong side in some political struggle. After this last proceeding was gone through with, the business of the day being over, and the city bell about to ring the signal for dinner, for which, after the fulfilment of such arduous judicial duties as they had performed, none felt more eager than the magistrates; the prisoners, sentenced and unsentenced, were removed to safe keeping, and by direction, the hoarse voice of the crier, in formal manner, adjourned the hoofdt, and Dirk and his puissant associates prepared to leave their seats of dignity, and mingle in the body of the dispersing audience, who were fain to wend away with homeward steps; but ere Dirk had crossed the apartment, his steps were stayed as were the burgomasters, whose departures were regulated by his motions; a stripling, partly enveloped in a cloak, and who appeared to have been watching the breaking up of the Court with eager and anxious impatience, sprang from a bench by which Dirk was about passing, and with imploring looks and in beseeching tones entreated his attention as he clung to his garments and withheld his departure— “Stay but a for moment, Mienheers,” exclaimed the youth in a pleading and mournful tone, “stay but for a moment, Sirs; ye who have been the bosom friends of the unfortunate Jacob Leisler; ye who I have seen his supporters and confidants, and more particularly you, heer Dirk, for whom he hath done so much, stay your steps but for a minute—by the memory of your former friendship, your ancient league and alliance; by all that hath passed in favour between ye, Sirs, I entreat, charge ye bestow kindness on his child, on Arnyte Leisler, who stands before you. For hours vain have I strove to gain a minute's sight, a word with him—I have been put back by loaded guns of guards, and driven with hoarse threats from my attempts. Good friends, I only ask ye to allow me to share his rugged dungeon with him, to sit by him and console him in his sorrows, to support his aged head upon my breast—for God's sake, Sirs, though the world may have deserted him, though all whom he relied on may have turned foes; let him not in the darkness of his wo for a moment suppose that I, his son, his child, have fled him too—have turned recreant with the rest.” The feelings with which Dirk heard and received this address, were by no means those of complaisance, indeed he was as much startled by the sudden and unlooked for presence of Arnyte, as if in his pathway a serpent had sprang up and met his approach with barbed and poisonous tongue, nor were the words of the stripling over well chosen, either for the attainment of that he petitioned for, had there at the moment been any inclination in Dirk's breast to grant it, or such as, as they reminded him of passages, which, at the present, he would fain have had forgotten, were well calculated to be acceptable to his hearing, he therefore, judging by his actions and countenance, appeared not a little displeased by his detention, and with quick and somewhat fearful glances, he looked about him to see who was within hearing, and then with a hasty and impatient motion, he strove to drag the skirt of his jerkin from the hands of the youth, but he failed, for Arnyte hung to it with all the pertinacity of despair. “Nay, you shall not leave me,” cried he, “you shall not do yourself the wrong to quit me thus, plunged in the bitterness of affliction, nor extend the hand to help me in my grief; the world speaks of you as a merciful, a compassionate man; belie it not—show pity unto me—the favour I seek is small in granting, yet if I gain it not, I shall be most wretched, most miserable.” Finding it difficult to unloose the hold of the stripling without answer and in silence, unless by main force, Dirk unbent his sternness, and in his most generous and considerate manner, explained to Arnyte the impossibility of his complying with his desires, as it was in direct contravention he asserted to his excellency, the Governor's orders on the matter; and that by permitting any person, even his son, to have an interview at this time with an attainted traitor, like Jacobus Leisler, he would be committing crime as a man, and betraying the trust imposed on him, as holding the station with which he was honoured by public confidence; the fact was, the thing was entirely against all rules and regulations, nay, against the law of the colony itself; he much regretted it—it was a hard case it must be confessed; but so it was, and he could show the book, the very page, where the strictness of procedure that was pursued with Mienheer Leisler was laid down incontrovertibly; therefore he concluded it was idle to request that which he was unable in any wise to allow, and advised with the most friendly solicitude for his welfare, that the young man should depart and make up his mind to the dire necessity, as easy as the exigency would suffer: and then finding the grasp of Arnyte relax in utter hopelessness at his refusal of entrance to his parent, he eagerly snatched the hem of his garment by which he had been detained from the trembling hands of the youth, and hastily strode away, leaving his suitor overwhelmed with misfortune. “He bids me begone! he bids me home! alas, I have now no home; no roof shelters now the ruined family of Leisler,” ejaculated, after a moment's pause, the agonized stripling, “and what shall I do hence, when my duty lies here? away I can give no relief; the heart-broken murmurs of my poor mother distract me in our miserable home, and I cannot sooth them even with hope, and here, yes, in my father's dungeon my duty lies. Stay and hear me,” continued he, interposing himself before the departing burgomasters, “ye are fathers! ye have sons, even as myself: reflect! did your situation as that of mine call on your offspring, bethink ye, from that love they should bear ye, in gratitude for the hours of servance in infancy, the care, tears, and anxiety, ye have bestowed upon their helplessness, were it not hard, cruel, to be denied but to gaze upon your face, to clasp your hand, to share your misery. If ye are men, formed in the mould of humanity: if your hearts are not harder than the gyves that hang upon yon wall, ye cannot deny my reasonable beseeching—ah! and will ye not listen to me? can ye have the souls, the frozen, icy souls to leave me with denial? for mercy, sirs, can ye think light of the charge upon me? remember ye not the precept of the holy book, and would ye interfere with the commands of him whose chariot is the whirlwind? I have spoken to you as fathers; ye have been sons too; ye have felt the fostering care, the tender warding from harm, and the thousand indescribable links of parental tenderness; then will ye hinder, for a moment, a son seeking to refund the great debt so strongly bound upon his existence, yea, for life; for when have I wept and he had the power that my tears were not dried; hath he not borne me through the dangers of my infancy and should he have cause to believe that in this hour of adversity ungratefully I shunned his fortune—nay, tell me it not, though it hath been so said, the Governor's mandate doth not intervene; ye have the power and can admit me to clasp his neck and kiss his aged cheek.” The stern determination of the sturdy burgomasters was not, however, to be shaken by the piteous pleadings of young Arnyte. They were possessed in too great a degree with the influence of that base tyrannical feeling, so common in the breast of man, that delights to have acknowledged by the degradation of his creatures, the power and superiority which it is luxury to exercise on all but mercy—yes, there are some who, like statues, love to hear their fellow beings sue and pray in vain, proud in their hour of might, nor give a thought to the transitory and fleeting changes of life, never deeming their turn of lowliness may chance. Few, indeed, in the summer hour of wanton prosperity, dream of the wintry storm that will follow in the uncertain course of human existence. With grim and unbending frowns the haughty burgomasters met the tearful eyes of the boy, upon whose long dark lashes the heavy drops fell, as when the spray, kissed by the morning breeze, showers the dews that the night spirit weeps upon the sleeping flowers;—he pleaded to men, who, though in the common path of their duty as burghers were kind and bore the reputation of religion— but who, filled with consequence and authority, were rendered cold and hardened as rocks on whose bleak sides the ice of winter clings. Neither is such carelessness of the miseries of a fellow creature, however inhuman, confined to the selfish breasts of Mienheers Filkins and Verplanck; numbers, even in these times, who have the reputation of charity, who spend money to relieve the unfortunate of their species, to appearance liberally—forsooth because they have taken the pains to let the world into the secrets of their alms; and who thereby have their vanity fed by public praise: yet they will grind the poor debtor for the last shilling reserved to obtain bread, and exult in his ruin and mourning. The burgomasters unrelentingly repulsed the youth, and shook him roughly and unceremoniously from their path. “Pize on ye, younker, this is uncivil of you to pester us —pugh—you have had our answer, pugh,” quoth Heer Filkins, frappishly, as he strode away with an eager, shuffling pace, as anxious to be rid of Arnyte's importunities. “Ja! mannikin—dis is der nonschenze do geeb beobles vor noding ven mien tinner is krowing gold,” echoed burgomaster Gelyn, and he drew his steps after those of his worthy associate—the eyes of Arnyte followed their departure with a look of reproachful bitterness. “And these,” he murmured indignantly, “are the men my deluded and abused parent fostered and warmed in his confidence, little recking that they followed him but for his prosperity; these are the men that broke his bread and shared his salt, and held his wine cup to their lips, and basked in the smiles of his favour; and these he trusted, on such as these he depended, nor dreamt of cold ingratitude. Good heaven! am I deceived—am I within the pale of civilized men, and can these things be? But yesterday, the losel that hangs about the palace gate, and watches for the crumbs the menials throw into the street, and worships as a deity the veriest varlet that spurns him, was not more lowly and abject than these time serving sycophants, who now cast me away in scorn, and tread me down as though I were a worm fit but to be crushed. Oh, were that yesterday to return! Alas, alas! our sun is set, and these birds that wantoned in its beams, fly the shade:” he wrung his hands in anguish of spirit. “And it is in the hands of beings thus cold, frozen and untouched by human feelings, that my poor parent's destiny is placed! what hope has he of justice? his unspotted loyalty—his noble, daring exertions for the revolution—his fortune spent in the Protestant cause—will these not avail against the machinations of his enemies? they must, Vol. II. 17 they shall speak, (even should it come to that) with trumpet tongue at the foot of the throne. And yet relief is distant, and I cannot bear to think on it;—he suffers—his aged limbs upon the dank dungeon floor—his wife, his son, his friends forced from his presence, nor allowed to share his sorrow. Great God! and I the cause! I could have fled the pirates' den alone, and now this Sloughter's mangled corpse had been food for the raging wolf. And do I, shame on my lip that breathes the word, regret saving a fellow creature from the murtherer's knife? no! let what may happen that shall not be; the very act done by these young hands shall plead even to the gates of mercy, were they to seek his life. His life! great God, his life!—what have I said—my father's life! they will not, dare not attempt so foul a deed. Yet, their hands are red with Milbourne's blood; but that was in the moment of wild, ungoverned passion; reason was lost —and he was rash and quick of temper; but my father is old, is mild, is kind, is gentle.—No! the earth itself would yawn, and swallow up the homicides that would think on a crime so monstrous, foul and base—out on it! the wild, mad thought doth fret me, and makes my heart heat at my ribs in terror, and my pulses throb like those of a chased and affrighted deer;—still, still I cannot quell these dreadful,—fearful ideas that throng in horror through my busy brain, and make me shrink from what may come.” He cast himself at length upon the nearest bench, and pressed hastily his heated brows to the stone, as if to gather relief from its coldness to his burning temples. After a short interval of uneasy rumination, he continued:—“Too surely men cannot be so utterly abandoned to all faith—so entirely regardless of every ancient favour and friendship; there still must be some who will venture limb, ere that which I dare not name should happen:—too sure they will not allow him to perish without an effort, however desperate. If words fail, why the sword,—the sword remains. Alas! this is but folly,—the very error of a dream; Manning, the vilest of traitors suffered not death, disgrace alone was his portion. My dear parent hath done nought that merits ignominy or persecution; certain it is, severely would their highnesses the king and queen visit on the heads of the offenders their anger, did they but presume to touch one hair of his revered head—but yet it is the wrath,— the frenzy of the present hour,—the delirium, that hath seized upon the minds of men and leads them remorseless, pitiless and unthinking to rage like hungered beasts of prey, and thirst for blood—that makes me tremble: great God! they have already had a taste of gore, and Milbourne may not be the only victim of their sacrifice.” He broke off the sentence as if shuddering at the image his own mind had conjured up, and then suddenly added in a hurried and resolute voice, “by heaven! I must,— I will see him, though I die in the attempt.” “Who, in the devil's name, is it you want to see, and what are you doing here, young one, when every body else hath gone about their business? come, tramp; take yourself off in a gliff; I am going to lock up;” said a harsh, coarse voice that sounded like the noise made by the grinding of a ragged millstone, at the side of the stripling, at the same time he was roughly seized and dragged from the bench. Arnyte started on his feet and turned towards the speaker; he was a tall, ill-favoured, bony, muscular looking man, with heavy and clumsily jointed limbs, and an unpleasant expression of countenance, every feature of which savoured of cunning malice and wickedness—large, thick black eyebrows overhung his small grey eyes, in which could be read little favourable to their possessor, for they were lightened by that sinister expression alone that bespeaks at once selfishness and insolence of power;—a knotted forehead, a long drooping nose with wide nostrils, a large mouth, and a sallow complexion,—formed a visage from which ignorance, dulness and hard-heartedness only could be presumed. From the attire and appearance of this personage his calling was easily to be divined; he had on a sad-coloured jerkin and doublet, with a leathern belt round his waist, from which depended a huge bunch of keys, most of which were of enormous size. He was the provost marshal, or city jailer; at his back were two assistants; one, a lank, thin, ugly, bearish looking fellow, with large goggle eyes and beetle brows, and the other, a stout, lusty, clownish lout; the one was armed with a long steel-headed pike, while the other carried a number of fetters, anklets and chains of iron. “Ah! is it you, burgomaster?”—said Arnyte, forgetting the unceremonious manner in which he had been just used by the hands of this personage, as he perceived who it was, and giving him the title which he had formerly been dignified with,—for it is certain that the same care in the ancient day was taken with all such ci-devant characters of consequence as is done in the present, by giving them or their relations some posts of profit; for it is a hard thing to serve the public without pay, unless one is rewarded at least with a dirt contract, or can in some way get remunerated from the ever open pockets of the grateful burghers;—this was the prevalent idea of the day, and the city was always well served; for if a street was paved, a hill dug down, or the public wharves let, the son, second cousin, uncle, or the burgomaster himself undertook the matter; and although the stadt was charged somewhat more than the things could have been effected for by others, yet it is well known the dearer the purchase, oftener the better goods; and then the advantage was to be considered of having such matters carried on under the immediate inspection of a father of the Stadt, who of course, would take the greatest charge, and exercise the most careful economy as to the manner of the work, and the cost and expenditure. Roelofsen Stoutenbergh, for such was the name of the city jailer, when elected to the Vroedschap, was somewhat stricken with poverty—so much so, that it is said it was a hard matter for him to muster up a gabardine befitting his puissant situation; indeed his rise was one of those singular freaks of fortune, which assimilates to the elevation of a tailor or hatter, to the rank of a general, or a baker to that of a mayor—several singular instances of which marvellous chances, have been the wonderment of the good burghers of Nieuw Amsterdam; nevertheless Roelofsen, though very poor, counted much on certain expectations from his father-in-law, an old, rich, swearing, drunken gardener, of Schakabanica; but he well knew it is long waiting for dead men's shoes, so as soon as he got a chance of getting a snug place, he left the station of burgomaster, and assumed the salaried place of the provost marshal—an office of considerable profit, as will be seen hereafter; adjoined to the regular income of which situation, he obtained an order of the council, which allowed him certain perquisites of an extra nature, for conducting criminals to jail, to the whipping post, the wooden horse, the cucking stool, the transport ship, and the gallows—his profits, particularly in the latter case, being oftentimes considerable, as he was not only the receiver of the breeches of the dead convict, but was his sole executor and heir; and this last capacity, was not alone confined to such instances, but numerous others could be enumerated, wherein he exercised it by virtue of his station. “Ah, burgomaster, is it you!” exclaimed Arnyte, a beam of hope lighting his eyes, as he eagerly seized the huge and reluctant hand of the provost marshal, “right glad am I to behold you—for in your power, lies the granting of that which I seek, and for which, an you extend your help to the afflicted and unfortunate, a hundred blessings will be showered on your head. My father, Jacob Leisler, is in confinement under your charge —you cannot, be you a man, deny a child the sight of his parent; allow me then, kind Mienheer, to have an interview but for a few brief moments with him—I ask no more.”— “Um—have you an order to effect admission, from any of the sitting magistrates?” returned the jailer in a growling tone, and coldly withdrawing his hand from the tremulous grasp of the youth— “Alas, no, they have refused me, sternly refused me,” answered Arnyte in a desponding voice. “Fico! young one, and did you believe I would let you see the fish withouten order? um—it can't be, master,” said the jailer gruffly. “For heaven's sake, good burgomaster, what harm 17* can there be in such conference as I will hold with my fallen and desolate parent?” “There's so much harm, that I won't let you in—fico! I won't do it, young one, so you'd best be off withouten more words,” replied the jailer short and testily. “Nay, Mienheer Stoutenbergh,” quoth Arnyte somewhat warmly, his spirit rising at the obdurate and insulting bearing of the provost marshal, “is Jacob Leisler one who hath coldly and unprovoked, embrued his hands in innocent blood, and foully acted a deed of wanton murther, or who hath felon-like threatened the existence of his creature, for gold? Is he, I say, a convicted knave, stained with crime—an outlawed villain, who hath put to the defiance all human law—a blasphemer of his Maker, that he and his are treated thus with contumely? I repeat it, Mienheer, you have those, the vilest of mankind, the homicide and the robber, in your custody, to whom more leniency is shown, than to him, who, whilome, was your ruler. “Young one, I know my duty withouten your teaching,” quoth the jailer in reply, and advancing on Arnyte with fierce and impatient gestures, “come, no more ado, nor wag that saucy tongue of thine so fast—but get thee on thy way—troop, I say.” “Sirrah! thou hast grown insolent with thy place, and dost forget thyself too far,” indignantly returned the provoked stripling, the blood crimsoning with a warm flush of ire, his cheek, and his veins swelling as the angry tide rushed through them, “I tell thee what, sir knave, this bearing towards me, doth ill become thee; sooth! it is not so long, since you quitted the losel rags of your birth, that you may perchance resume them; I say you may live to repent your inhumanity.” Scarce had Arnyte, with proud and undaunted confidence, uttered these imprudent words, when the jailer, who had heretofore unloosened the keys from his girdle, and had held them in his hand during the last speech, and now stung to brutal passion by the youth's invective, suddenly and violently struck the stripling in the face with them, who, with a piercing shriek of agony, in an instant sank down senseless on the stone pavement at the feet of his savage oppressor, his blood gushing from the wounds made with the iron weapons, and his eyes and nostrils running a stream of gore, which welled around his prostrate body. “That, malapert, will learn thee to be civil,” said the provost marshal, as with a ferocious scowl he bent over his fallen victim. “Here, Boele,” continued he, addressing one of his attendants, “take this audacious varlet and throw him out of doors on the slip, where his kinsman met his fate. These Leisler hounds were all an impudent race, it would not bring many tears from me did the Aansprecker[20] [20] The funeral messenger. go his rounds for the whole set o' them— and hark thee, Boele, when thou hast done that job, close this room while I look to the under wards, here's the keys. So now Dolph you may bring along the bracelets.” Having thus directed, the provost marshal, accompanied by the assistant who carried the fetters, quitted the apartment; spurning as he went, with ruthless and unfeeling unconcern, with his foot from his way his felled and feeble antagonist; nor betraying in his unmoved and sodden face the least pity or care as to the situation of the rash boy, who had so incautiously brought on his head his barbarous ire. The blow by which Arnyte had been borne down was heavy and stunning, and if deliberately aimed would doubtless have been fatal; but though the flesh about the forehead was bruised and torn, and his visage was gashed and lacerated wherever the keys had scattered when he was struck by them, yet his insensibility was happily but of short duration; for as he lay, a sudden quickening of life came over him, and he felt a hand busied upon his apparel. Recollection returned, and the cold sweat that had bedewed his limbs died away —every sinew of an instant was braced, and with an agitated and convulsive motion, the effort of strength in which apparently was beyond his years and delicate form, he started on his feet. The first sound as he rose that broke on his hearing was the rattling of something which he seemed to have flung from him in rising; he dashed aside with a hasty hand the clotted and gory locks that blinded his eyes. On the floor from which he had started lay a piece of money, while at a pace's distance, out-stretched upon the pavement of the room, was the provost marshal's assistant, in whose charge Arnyte had been delivered; the man had been cast in this prostrate situation while busied in plundering the youth, unexpecting his sudden recovery. As Arnyte beheld the sullen and disappointed glances with which the fellow eyed the piece that had evidently escaped his clutches by the unlooked for movement, and saw the eager struggling which shook his outstretched hand as he resumed his feet, for the possession of the glittering metal—a dread of further violence came over the mind of the stripling, which increased as he marked the threatening frown and surly look with which he was gazed at. “Here,” said Arnyte, taking up the dubbeltje and holding it out for the acceptance of the turnkey, while a hope of winning him to his purpose ran through his mind, “here, take this good friend, and I will add to it a zesthalven, which is all I have about me—aye, nearly all my ruined fortunes hath left since they have seized upon my parent's homestead, and hold it in the crown's name. Take it, good friend, and let me but pass to the dungeon of Jacob Leisler;” the man eagerly snatched at the money, but hesitated on the request of the youth, who strenuously renewed his entreaties. “Let me but pass, kind friend—let me but enter his dungeon—my life shall be a toil for you; my prayers shall be your reward; heaven will bless you for the deed;—yea, the memory of it shall live in my breast until it is cold in the grave. I have not perhaps wherewithal now to repay such kindness, but depend on it if I live you shall meet your deserts. There are, there must be some who will extend their hands to relieve the house of Leisler; and from them you shall receive that gold which I am unsupplied with: and should it be, as well I hope, that my family is restored to its former consequence and possessions, I pledge myself this favour shall be among the first that return shall be given to —let me but pass, kind friend, and cheer him in his lonesome dungeon.” The fellow's resolution was apparently shaken by this appeal, and after a moment's faint refusal his determination was entirely changed by the sight of the zesthalven, which Arnyte drew forth and held in his hand, and he consented to conduct him to his father's prison. Arnyte overwhelmed him with thanks and promises, as with cautious steps he led him forth from the apartment to the hall; when after commending him to silence, with a stealthy pace they proceeded to mount the stairs that led to the upper stories of the building. They were a wide and heavy flight, with a clumsy balustrade, of which every banister was carved, and was as thick as a man's arm. On arriving at the top they came to a small and dark entry, at the apparent end of which was a door of solid plank studded with enormous nails, and braced and banded with strips of iron; a chain was drawn across it on the outside. Having undone this, and covering the large lock as he opened it with his cloak, so as to deaden the creaking of the key while it turned, the guide unlocked an inner door or rather grating, and bid Arnyte enter, telling him he must remain quiet within until after the rounds had passed, when he would return and conduct him without the stadthuis walls; he then left him, carefully closing and locking the doors after him as he departed. Arnyte listened for an instant to the harsh creaking of the lock, which seemed to shut him in from the world, and looked for a moment on the ponderous doors with an involuntary shudder which he could not conquer, as it ran through his frame; then with a sore heart he turned to the dismal abode of wretchedness and crime in which he had entered, and prepared to meet the unfortunate Jacob Leisler within the miserable precincts. SECTION II. “I am so worn away with fears and sorrows, So wintered with the tempest of affliction, That the bright sun of your life quickening presence Hath scarce one beam of force to warm again My spring of comfort.” THE PRISON. The place in which Arnyte now stood, was a hall of considerable size, but which, though lighted by several windows which looked on the slip that fronted the building, wore a gloomy and heavy aspect, for, added to the numerous bars and close gratings of iron, which nearly covered the exterior of the windows on the inside, the rays of day were rather obstructed than helped, by casements composed of small panes of glass of a greenish dye, dirty and discoloured, many of which were broken or shattered, and their places supplied with foul rags, and hats, and paper, and through the remainder of which, almost in vain, the sickly and feeble sunbeam of a wintry day, strove to pierce. The place indeed, with its low dank walls, and massy architraves, wore the funereal hue of twilight, and darkness was wont to sit within the miserable den long ere the day beams had faded from the heaven, and gave place to the æthiop visaged night; in spite, too, of its lofty situation, the air of this prison was close, noxious and confined, and when breathed, fell on the lungs with a feverish weight, while the dampness of the season struck through the sides of the building, and mingled with the unwholesome vapours that hung around; fœtid and stifling odours, and an unnatural heat, contended with the winter's cold. It was a spot wherein health could not long exist, and but few, except such wretches whom frequent crime had made accustomed to its horrors, could live within its bounds; and yet, withal, saith the tradition, that most veracious of journals, the Post-boy—its conductor, actuated by the like motives with which his modern prototypes bepraise and belard with flatteries every insect in office, was daily superabundant and overwhelming with compliments on the efficient, active and excellent burgomaster Stoutenbergh, the keeper, for his exquisite management of the prison—the cleanliness, wholesome air, and decency that reigned throughout; that the place was never well taken care of, until the worthy burgomaster came in office, nor were the convicts under his charge, ever better behaved— and that the latter case was not singular, considering the mild temper, and manners, and kind humanity, which the good Mienheer, the provost marshal, possessed. In truth such was the circulation of these remarks of the Post-boy, that many honest burghers, as they whiffed their pipes over its sapient columns, were persuaded—for even at present, there are many who consider all avouched in print, particularly in a public journal, as certain facts, to be undisputed, that the tigthuis of Nieuw Amsterdam, was preferable to their own fire sides, and grumbled that the stadt enforced a stiver a head as taxes, for the support of rogues and vagabonds like gentlemen —while the goed vrouws were profuse in admiration of the generous hearted jailer, declaring he was worthy of being made a deacon,—and therefrom, burgomaster Stoutenbergh became a member of a charitable society, formed for the purpose of sending Dutch Bibles to the poor ignorant paynims of Madagascar—who stood, as the Dutch dominies asserted, in danger of being damned for the want of the light of Revelation taught them, in the sonorous and melodious hoogduitch taal; and moreover, to confirm the truth of the suggestions in his favour, as to his lenient behaviour towards his prisoners, Mienheer Stoutenbergh, once a year, received a visit from a committee of the burgomasters, who, together with his friend, of the Post-boy, (who from meddling with every thing, acquired the reputation of importance, and thereby had a standing invitation to all city entertainments,) after having feasted voluptuously in the keeper's department, at the cost, however, of the city, and having drank Spanish wine and zwaar beir, until they were either blind or saw things with a double sight, (which latter was no uncommon case with double Dutch burgomasters,) gave a cursory glance through the prison, which, in expectation of their presence, had been scraped and scrubbed and white-washed for the first time that twelvemonth, and which they always took care to report to the vroedschap as in a satisfactory situation, adding that Mienheer, the provost marshal, treated them to the best Maaslandsley's pipes they had ever smoked; and such reports being ordered to be published, appeared thereafter at length in the Post-boy, accompanied with the publisher's own remarks and advice on prison discipline, with which, like every thing else, he conceited he was well acquainted; after which, for the edification of his readers, he was wont to give them a perusal of all the learned and facetious toasts drank by himself and the doughty members of the stadt council on the occasion, his own being always one pre-eminent for its wit and compliment to the entertainer and Joffer Stoutenburgh. However, at the time that Arnyte looked upon the prison walls, the visit of examination by the burgomasters had long been past, nor was there an immediate expectation of another, and the place was loathsome with dirt and filth and neglect. On the side of the hall opposite to the windows were entrances to several small and darksome apartments, the doors of which, as did every other thing about the place, partook of a massiveness of structure, strength, and shape: like the outer one of the hall, they were each cased and bound with ribs and plates of iron, and almost lined with large headed nails; a small square light, or rather grating of cross bars, was in the centre of each of these doors, some of which opening in an apartment where a solitary criminal was chained, were fastened and strongly secured with a stout bar, or rather iron tongue, that covering the lock defended it from any attempt to force or tamper with it; the entrances of the other rooms were unclosed, giving free communication with the hall, from which, however, there was as little chance of escape or departure for its inmates, whose unhappy lot it was to be confined in this place without distinction of age, sex, or crime; men and women, boys and girls, the young, the aged, the sick, the dying, the innocent and the guilty, were thrown together as it were in one mass to taint and corrupt each other; the novice gathering from the black despair of his own heart and the encouragement and example of his companions, a taste and love for crimes, for which, here-tofore, he had only felt remorse, was here alike condemned and forced to drink in his sighs of sorrow, with the malignant and infected air of the prison. Beside the regardless and careless ruffian, whose knife but lately ripped life from the breast of a fellow creature, and who seeks to whisper, with many a sneering laugh at his moans, which the assassin terms childish repentance, sentiments at once profane and obscene in his revolting hearing, sits some youth, whose only crime is the misfortune that he is suspected of guilt he never committed; here the felon and the false coiner, hardened in vice and wickedness, are glorying as they teach their trades of infamy, in their wanton and lascivious lives to some attentive and emulous listener, who as yet had been betrayed but in a single error; the insolvent debtor, the drunken burglar, the abandoned prostitute, and the leprous beggar, were huddled in the same neighbourhood, compelled to endure at once their own misery and behold that of others. When Arnyte entered this den of grief and crime, here and there only a straggling wretch was pacing the extent of the place in moody silence, or scrawling with charcoal on the wall, while at the farther end of the hall, as well as he could discern through the clouds of smoke, which being broken in their egress by double iron-gratings, that choaked the mouth of the chimney, intended to prevent escape by ascending its darksome and perilous passage, poured in voluminous bodies in the prison, creeping with an avidity for warmth to their shivering members, and gathered in a heap of almost shapeless filth, the very vermin engendered by their own bodies, dropping around at every motion Vol. II. 18 as they hung over one solitary stick of wood, their allowance for several hours, and which, green and wet, scarcely burnt, but smouldered to ashes, sat on the bare floor four or five miserable beings, whose haggard, sickly, and cadaverous looks, dim, sunken eyes, dishevelled hair, and limbs, that but for a dirty blanket that was drawn with feeble hand across their shoulders, would have been naked, gave them an aspect of the most heart rending despair, the effect of long severe sufferings and protracted imprisonment; but this disgusting show of hopeless wretchedness was apparently not general, for from several of the adjoining cells, ever and anon broken out horrible execrations, heartless curses, and the wild, discordant notes of ribald song and of mirth and of laughter, while in the dull or debauch-flushed countenances of one or two of the walkers of the hall, could be traced an expression of contented indifference and recklessness of fate; and some wore in their apparel an air of comfort and even some splendour of their past fortunes, which the mercy of the keeper and his assistants permitted them to retain while the prisoner could command such favour by the contributions of connexions or friends, who might still adhere to him in unhappiness, or until the excellent Mienheer Stoutenbergh was thoroughly convinced he had extracted the last dotkin, when both doublet and jerkin followed, and the last remnant of worth was soon stripped from the victim's limbs, and he was forced to hovel with the most squalid and the lowest, subject to the jeers and mockery of his heretofore envious companions, (for jealousy tyrannized even in this miserable cavern, and various where the vile arts and abandoned treachery practised often at the expense of their fellows, with which the smile and kindness of the brutal jailer, and even the most insignificant turnkey, were bought,) and the insults of those to glut whose rabid avarice his all had been sacrificed. Arnyte had scarcely crossed the door way, and had time to survey the dismal scene before him, ere a man, who stood idly leaning against the wall with legs carelessly crossed, in an attitude of listlessness, within a few paces of the entrance of the place, and having eyed the youth for a moment with a sharp, quick, and inquisitive glance of impudent curiosity or wonder, ejaculated with a loud, squeaking, and unpleasant utterance, the words “a fish! a fish!” Those near the speaker taking the sound, turned their eyes upon the stripling and repeated the slang words, which in an instant flew from mouth to mouth to the extremity of the hall, and were reiterated as they passed from the interior of each dungeon, from most of which in a moment a motley throng poured forth tumultuously, while the small gratings of the others were crowded with anxious faces and eager eyes which gazed with different feelings of pleasure or derision upon the new comer; indeed, for an interval, the most abject being in the prison seemed to have his attention called from his own cares and wo, as though to look upon a creature of a different sphere, and it is hard to say, whether the predominant feeling with which they regarded the fresh mate of their confinement, as they supposed the stripling, was pity for his as yet unknown misfortune, that gave him a share of their sorrow, or delight that they alone were not sufferers, but that misery poured her vials on others; that besides them there were those who were wretched and outcast; in truth, their greetings might rather be compared to the welcome with which devils would receive some fallen angel, or of the reception by the damned of some lost soul, whose wickedness had numbered it with their doleful ranks. It was with no little embarrassment that Arnyte underwent the scrutiny of the ruffian and unencouraging glances that were bent so rigidly upon him, and it was with timid and hesitating manner, and an uncertain and tremulous step that he approached and prepared to address the person whose voice had first, in the strange fashion related, announced his coming in the hall, and who being the nearest he perforce sought to make inquiry at him of his imprisoned parent; neither was his failing confidence greatly reassured but rather diminished by the cold, calculating, sneering, and unfeeling cast of countenance of this personage, whose features it struck him were somehow familiar to him, and whose bearing was such as to make him falter to apply to him—the stature of this man was naturally tall, but more from habit than age his head sank forward on his shoulders, so that although the whole body from this had attained somewhat of a drooping posture, yet his shoulders appeared to set straight and almost to rise above his ears; his limbs were gaunt and fleshless, and his visage long, thin, and sallow to such a degree that the skin fairly resembled the darkest parchment, having the same livid and deathlike hue; his beard was grizzled and his eyebrows long and thick, nearly overshadowing his small sharp grey eyes, which were the only speaking feature he possessed, and in whose quick orbs lurked cunning and roguery, and indeed every evil passion of human nature; however, ere Arnyte could muster up resolution to speak to this character, he himself was accosted by the prisoner. “How comest in the net, lad?” quoth the man, with an utterance at once shrill and disagreeable, while Arnyte, from his peculiar countenance and voice, almost instantaneously recognized in the speaker one of that desperate gang of outlaws who prowled about the province, confederate with the corsair Kid, in disposing of the plunder of his roving cruises, and whose chief employment at other times was the passing of counterfeit coin; indeed this was the very same man who hath heretofore been slightly introduced in this narrative, and the youth remembered him as the one who but the night before, in that forest wigwam, had been the first cause of the pirate Loffe's mutiny against his vengeful leader, and who having returned from that dreary place of rendezvous had been seized on his first appearance in the city by the hands of justice, which had been long watching to take him, and he was now held to stand trial for some one of the numerous crimes he had committed—his situation to him, however, was a matter of little moment, he had oftener been in greater danger, and had, either by clemency or fortune, escaped punishment, though deserving its severest measure; and now he counted from the peculiar situation of the act for which he was confined, on compounding the felony with Dirk Van Rikketie and his worshipful associate, the king's attorney, who, in their wisdom, many times considered they read the laws aright if they punished the smaller rogues and pardoned the greater; possibly fearful that in case they reversed the plan their offices might become extinct for want of knaves to try and condemn, and they thereby lose good livings and rich salaries. As the memory of the man came o'er him, a thrill of horror rushed through the quivering limbs of the startled stripling, and he shrunk back as though the deadly point of a naked dagger had been thrust to stay him in his pathway, while the change of habiliments which Arnyte had made since his restoration to his friends, his face wounded with the conflict with the jailer, together with the slight notice in his servile capacity, that the man had bestowed upon the boy, prevented a like remembrance upon his part. “How comest in the net, lad?” said the coiner, without noticing the emotion of him he spoke with, “hast slit a basket, or dipt in cognyac, youngster? or art one of Koby Barquier's[21] [21] An Illustrative Idea.—Divers serious enquiries have I made on the meaning of the words in the text, yet fruitless hath been my attempts to discover the spirit thereof; nathless, the idea which I am inclined from many reasons, to give credence unto, is that the words are the appellatives of some noted highwayman and freebooter of the olden time; albeit, if so, I have not been enabled to trace the precise spot where his lurking places were situate; nathless, there goeth a tradition that the neighbourhood of the ancient city wall (i. e. the place where Wall-street now is,) was sorely infested, and of a verity, it hath always, yea, unto this day, been the resort of many noted plunderers and suspicious characters.—T. P. highbinders? though thou lookest green to handle a growler; whose thy fence, lad? hast any o' thy bootle left from the cuddies, say lad? I am an honest man you may depend on me, so let us go quips.” Having spoken thus he stepped close on the youth, and very unceremoniously prepared, after slapping him familiarly on the shoulder, to run his hand over the stripling's jerkin, and to examine the contents of his pockets; but Arnyte, who, during his captivity with the marauder, had before heard the slang used by the coiner, understood sufficient of his expressions, to perceive that the fellow took him for a thief or a vagabond, who, by his actions, he deemed was yet young in the business, and whom he could therefore pilfer of his spoil with impunity—and 18* so assuming courage from the alarming motions of the man, Arnyte abruptly shook the coiner from him. “I am not what you take me for, master,” said he somewhat haughtily, “I am not your fellow—I have admission here to see Mienheer Jacobus Leisler, who, I am taught, is here prisoned; an you like to do a favour, conduct me to his presence.” As Arnyte uttered this, the whole terror of the prison, and the idea of his father's endurance of the ignominy and wretchedness of such a place, burst at once on his mind with electric force, superseding all other thoughts, and he felt nigh sinking to the earth—“though great God!” continued he, while his lips quivered with anguish as he spoke, “they cannot—they have not dared to lodge him in this horrible den—a place unmeet for humanity. It will kill him—oh! it will kill him.” “On my reputation, lad,” quoth the coiner, as he drew back from Arnyte and gazed on him with a sharp and inquiring look, “troth, it must be a man of little spirit, that would give in to death for the sake o' the place, though our bread be none of the whitest here, and our broth be of bones that a starved dog would loathe the gnawing—the liquor blacker than an African's skin; yet one should make the best on it, though an it like you,” here he dropped his voice to a whisper, and brought his mouth almost to the ear of Arnyte, first, however, having cast a hurried glance around him, to see that none was near enough to catch his words, “though an it like you,” pursued he, “to let me have your knife, or mayhap you may ha' brought a file, or the like, an so, give it here quickly, and warrant me, ere to-morrow, yon sturdy locks of iron shall fly loose at my bid, as an the doors were held by a straw wisp; the best stone shall rise from its seat in the wall, while the mortar shall roll on the floor, like crumbs for the feeding of birds: do you take me, lad? what say ye? I mean for old Leisler's vantage, on my reputation—so let me have a schilling, to get some blackstrap of master Stoutenbergh—blast it, my throat is parching for a dram.” At the first moment, the idea of liberty to his father, although so strangely conveyed, made the heart of Arnyte bound joyously within him, and he drew his breath thick with hope; he unthinkingly was about to grasp with cagerness the hand of the coiner, and express his heartfelt gratitude for the offer of the criminal, and pledge his own co-operation to perfect the object, when, as he looked in the man's face, whether in thought or reality, he could scarce for the instant determine, he perceived a slight quivering of the upper lip, and a momentary contortion, as of a sneer, ran through the features, while something like derision lurked in the corners of the villain's busy eyes; the expression, however, instantly died away—but it had recalled recollection to the youth's mind; the profligate character of the ruffian, the singularity and the suddenness of this last address—and there was something certainly in the manner, so he persuaded himself, of the man's disusing his slang terms, and particularly, in thus unbosoming himself to one who was apparently an utter stranger to the fellows. All these struck him, that the coiner was but sounding his own purpose, to fathom his intentions whether there was a plan on foot for his father's escape, and what was likely if such had been—(for he had heard of persons equally base, in like times,) after having wormed himself in the secret for his own benefit or pardon, that he might hasten to betray his confiding companion. Indeed the criminal's bearing, was not that of a person whom Arnyte could have trusted, or for a moment have depended on. He therefore hastily proceeded to repel the man's unwelcome advances—and the coiner, soon disappointed in whatever he might have been aiming at, and seemingly offended, withdrew, with a menacing brow and threatening eye, from the side of the stripling, and walking off joined a small group of his fellow prisoners, whom he quickly engaged in a converse which was carried on in a low voice, while judging from their gestures, and the frequent glances cast in the direction he moved, Arnyte was evidently the object of their discourse. Being thus freed from the company of this dangerous acquaintance, undisturbed by the other tenants of this gloomy region, (for, having satisfied themselves with gazing on the stranger of their dwelling, some withdrew to the sports wherewith they had been quelling the weariness of imprisonment, or to the employment of their sad reflections, while those who remained near the youth, refrained from intruding themselves upon his notice, possibly withheld by the idea that either the coiner, who was well known by every rogue as a rare hand, had already stripped the bird of all that could be got, or, that from the last mentioned worthy's sudden retreat, the pigeon was not worth the plucking,) he advanced further in the place, but with slow and reluctant pace— yet when he looked in the nearest cell, and viewed with eye of grief, and heart moved by the sight, at once to tenderness and pity, indignation and detestation—when all the strange confusion, and the degradation of human nature burst upon him that the horrid dungeon exhibited, he paused for strength to bear it, ere he inquired for his parent, while the wish rushed strongly on him, that he had been deceived and misled by the keeper's assistant, and that he was mocked with the idea that Jacob Leisler was an inhabitant of this hell of guilt, infamy and misery, or anywise a partaker of its frightful recesses. Within the close, dank, and narrow corners of this dreary hole, (and even such epithet, can scarcely convey an idea of the loathsomeness of aspect of these caverns, the confines of the largest of which, could not have exceeded seven feet in the measure of length or breadth,) from eight to ten wretched objects, in the shape of living creatures, were crowded together as it were, wallowing like beasts in some noisome penthouse: the flickering ray of light that stole into this dismal apartment was rendered more obscure and dim by means of the obstruction of a filthy, ragged mat that hung before the inner casement, so that darkness, to eyes unaccustomed to pierce its misty bounds, clouded the farther nooks and corners of the place. Neither table, chair, bench, nor stool, nor any other necessary utensil for the comfort of life, was to be seen: the bare, hard plank of the prison floor served the inhabitant of this dungeon at once whereon to crouch, to sit, and to eat from—and fortunate was the wretch, and it was with difficult and unceasing guard and watch that he retained them from the envious and greedy hands of his fellows, if the hardness of his bed was relieved by a thread worn and leprous looking blanket, or a small bundle of long used and dirty straw. Upon the rugged walls horrible and disgusting caricatures and figures were drawn; words and couplets of grief, religion, and revolting obscenity were confusedly sketched—here the trembling hand of some repentant sinner had relieved the heavy burden of his overwrought conscience by some melancholy verse —while there the immoral and unconscious libertine had scrawled a memento of the bagnio or the gambling house. Armies of rank and poisonous spiders laboured at their intricate meshes on the low and dusky ceiling; nor was there absent from the den a nauseous insect or abhorred thing that in its atmosphere could live. The venomous rat there had his nest—the brown backed roach and each creeping vermin that loves putridity, in hordes wandered about it undaunted, crawling on the flesh and infesting the garments of the prisoner. Of the inmates of this place, Arnyte discerned one, a very skeleton, stretched at length upon the floor, evidently too enfeebled to arise from his recumbent position; his attenuated and emaciated limbs were horrible in rags and nakedness, covered with corrupt and sickening sores, around which, as about the carcass of a carrion, huge maggots were wantoning; passive he lay, stirless and unmoving as already a corse, with features ghastly and withered: and had it not been for now and then a low and painful moan that heaved his bosom as it would have burst it, a slight shiver as of coming death that shook the fragile frame, he might have been taken for a body from which the spirit had long departed, and which was cast in that charnel vault unheeded, to rot and be consumed; for Arnyte was too far from him to mark the quivering lip, the beaded drop that stood upon the brow, or the big tear that ever and anon made its way from the dim, half closed eye, that bespoke a mind too much disturbed to reck of outward wo, and to which the grave were alone relief. But a pace or two distant from this last most wretched creature, were two men widely different from him but now described; they were seated on a heap of chains, which fastened to an iron staple in the centre of the floor, were locked at one end by separate anklets round a leg of each of these criminals, and so held them in companionship. The dress, looks, and character of bearing of these were desperate and ruffian like; they were engaged in gambling, and regardless of the dying situation of their neighbour, they at times made the dungeon roof ring again with their obstreperous peals of laughter, oaths and curses, or discordant quarrels. The complexion of the one who was apparently the most abandoned of the two, was of a sandy hue,—high cheek bones, light hair, reddish whiskers and mustaches, with light blue eyes, scarcely marked by a brow, formed his abhorrent visage. This man was condemned for murder, the commission of which had been attended with the most atrocious brutality. The other was one of those wily villains, of whom there were at the time numbers, who for the sake of plunder or revenge upon some enemy, had complotted with the black slaves to rise and fire some dwelling and slay its tenants. This wretch had been a preacher, and by that means wormed himself into the confidence of the ignorant and unsuspecting for his own purpose. He was now under the dreadful sentence so common in the annals of the province for punishment of his class of crime, and particularly resorted to in after years in the execution of the ringleaders of the great negro conspiracy; he was to be placed in an iron cage, which was to be hung from some lofty tree or gibbet, and left for the wild and carnivorous birds of heaven to feast on; bread was to be placed in his sight, but which his load of chains would prevent him from reaching; all men were forbid to yield him help under pain of a severer penalty: and yet such was the recklessness of this hardened and unrelenting creature, though but a brief space intervened ere the commencement of his sufferings, whether alive to the reality of his situation for which there was no hope seemingly of escape, or whether with courage braced to a carelessness of his approaching fate, he scarce appeared to heed it with a thought, but plunged in all the blasphemy, revel, and wild wassail of the prison house. On the ear of Arnyte the profanity of the dissolute grated harshly as thunder claps, and struck terror to his very soul; and the groans and sighs of the sorrowful fell heavily on his heart, which sickened within him; while tears of pity hung upon his eyes at the endurance of the fearful sight of the afflictions of the tenants of that direful abode. The heart rending spectacle of one group in particular moved his every latent feeling of grief and tenderness: this was a mother and her children; the miserable parent with agonized impatience sought to still the sad and querulous lamentations of a cadaverous and sickly looking infant, which she supported in her feeble arms, while more she strove to lend each moment to the squalid babe, (which though hideous from suffering in other eyes, appeared lovely in hers,) a further portion of her own scanty raiment to shield it from the searching cold— while at her knees clung two others of her hapless offspring, half clad, though revolting to behold with the filth of neglect; these with beseeching looks and visages sunk with famine, were demanding food for existence, from their unfortunate parent, who had already yielded the mouldy prison crust, her day's allowance, to their unsatiated hunger; and now only she could answer their cries with a wild and despairing look, in which, terrible to relate! anguish was mixed with the madness of inebriety! The offence of that doating mother was infanticide —the blood of one of her own children slain in drunkenness yet reeked upon her hand. Faint, and stricken with pity and horror, Arnyte slowly turned his eyes from the sight of infamy and wretchedness; he was at once overwhelmed by the terrific scene and his own dreary reflections—for a moment he gasped for breath, and could hardly sustain himself from falling to the floor; and it was a minute or so ere he could recover resolution and firmness enough to pursue the course of his adventure. As he was about moving onward with a determination to prosecute his search, and to learn at once the worst of the condition of his father, he was addressed by a person who for some little time past had been, with a peering scrutiny, employed in regarding his actions and vivid emotions; this was an aged and venerable looking man, whose locks were like some circlet of snow that crowns a wintry mountain top; the expression of his countenance, with the exception of his eye which was slightly defective, was not unfavourable; and his body bent beneath the weight of years. About his dress too, which though whole was extremely threadbare, there was a degree of cleanliness and neatness remarkable for the place and his own situation. He had a peaked and grizzled beard, trimmed in the fashion of the nobility and courtiers of a century past, and his trunk hose was in the Flemish taste of an ancient date; his fingers were covered with numerous rings, which though of glittering cast by being retained by their owner from the hungry grasp of his fellow prisoners, must have been valueless; while ornaments of the like material and shape depended from his ears. But however, there was something ridiculous that injured the respectability of appearance of this personage, in the mock importance, gravity, and dignified carriage with which he bore himself; which though befiting some Spanish grandee amid his serfs, was totally at variance with all character of an inhabitant of the rasphuis of Nieuw Amsterdam. “My son,” quoth the ancient with a decorous and solemn enunciation, and with the sedate and majestic bearing of a sage speaking to his disciple, but which sober manner could scarce be relied on whether as jest or earnest from the contradictory, or rather arch and wanton roll and leer of the eye whose fault has been mentioned, and which at the same time with one expression was apparently lowering on the person he was engaged with, and with another was jocosely eliciting the attention of such as listened to the parlance, “my son,” said he, “you are if appearance speaketh truly, a novice in this our monastic seclusion; and though the saw hath it—trust not looks, for a still surface covers deep water,—yet it giveth me pleasance to greet thee, for your countenance speaks not of evil, and as the Latin proverb expresses it, nemo turpissime subito est. This is a sad home to crouch in, young man: nathless why mourn, Diogenes was contented in a tub; yet you will say Diogenes was a cynic, and you are none. But look to Plato—does he not in his inimitable Phedron give you an example of true contentment and philosophy? Remember, young man, the divine Socrates in his dungeon. With what equanimity did Seneca bear the persecutions of a tyrant; and what were the feelings on this head of Strato, Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, and Democritus. Do you take my advice? grey hairs should be listened to with reverence; when you have seen as much of the world as I have young man, you may speak of your knowledge—for experience is knowledge. You are going to remind me of your misfortunes; true, but what are misfortunes? nothing. Look on me, young man; my father-in-law was Abraham Isaacs Plank, to whom Governor Kieft sold Pauleus Hoek for four hundred and fifty guilders Holland, on the first day of May 1638.[22] [22] Vide Records. And mark me, young man, that is not all; this very building stands on his ground, which ran a mile from this place—yet I am kept from my right by power, and I am now held my body in vile durance for a few paltry stivers of costs, although the heir of wealth enough to buy half Rotterdam. But I have appealed—my case is carried before the judges at Westminster; and mark me, young man, you are in that which you may live to see turned into a palace that shall outdo Hampton Court or Whitehall as my residence. Do you take my advice—fret not, but bear the peltings of the storm of fate without repining —for in what consists true philosophy but in making up one's mind for a time to bear the worst. Can you find a reason against my axiom, young man,—do you take my advice? you should not hunt for reasons, but remember what Aristotle taught according to the report of Sextus Empiricus, `posthabito in sensu quaerere rationem.' This singular discourse was heard by Arnyte with astonishment, and he gazed with wonder on the speaker, scarce knowing what construction to put on his eccentricity. Vol. II. 19 At times he could not restrain an involuntary shudder that with a throbbing of alarm and sorrow mixed beat at his heart, as he supposed this personage was one of those lost beings whose mind, in the blasting conflict of its powers, occasioned by an accumulation of misfortune past human endurance, had become partially wrecked, and sense had sunk under the burthen of misery; but yet there was in contradiction to this idea of derangement a placid, quiet, and orderly demeanour, and a system or connexion in his speech: yet again so wild and doubtful were the expressions he used relative to his own imprisonment, that apparently such beacons of saneness were but like watch fires on a dreary midnight coast, serving to warn the mariner from encountering its dangers, darkness, and desolation—they were but signs that there was a method in his madness. So thought the stripling, and he strove with impatience to disengage himself from one whose words served no purpose but delay, and thereby added new torments to the fever of anxiety that oppressed his fretted heart. Distracted with dismal fears as to the parent for whom he was in search, he eagerly sought in several attempts to utter the smooth words which hung upon his lips, to sooth that which he deemed the irritation of the person who had thus directed his speech to him, and to free himself from his company; but his endeavours were fruitless, the sage was not so easily to be shaken off, neither would he allow utterance to ought that seemed to interfere with the purport of his parlance; and he was truly dogmatical in retaining his unwilling listener, for having griped him firmly by the sleeve lest he should escape him, and in spite of the twists and jerks with which ever and anon his hearer strove to loosen the hold by which he was bound, and all unmindful of the distressed attention with which his prolixity was received, he pertinaciously continued to persevere in the motley tenor of his speech. “Young man,” pursued the philosopher, “do you take my advice—though an I rede ye aright, you possess all the frenzy of youth, and scorn with hasty rashness the caution of greybeards: yet what I tell you none can gainsay—there are worse places than this on the earth, and where you may suffer more; yet possibly you may argue, male pericolosam libertatem quam quietum servitium—however, you have not yet seen as much of the world as I have; or bad as it is, (and but little can be said in its favour) you might be able, even in this prison house, to find something to like and prefer to that wide and bustling globe of which Balbus speaks so well, `nec majus, nec melius mundo;' you should not despise that which I say unto you on account of the plight and situation I am in at present—mark my words young man, the durance which I now undergo shall be viewed with horror hereafter, and you may live to see pilgrimages to my dungeon in honour of him who is now here before you. Remember Galileo's prison, what but ignorance was the cause of his persecution, and what is it in my case but envy? however, let me but recover my right —let me but once get the Plank property, and young man you shall see that which shall surprise you. I will not mind money where I find merit—do you take my advice young man, and I trust it is not the admonition of a stoic —I feel for my fellow creatures, even amid the ungenerous treatment I have received at their hands, I have been labouring for their good; yes young man, in this place have I discovered the arcana, the grand secret of being, the very alchemy from which existence is derived—the height of human invention—the perpetuam rei—the philosopher's stone—the true grand secret of life—the alembic, before the trial of which every other vessel of chemistry fails! but young man, this is inviolable between us; take my advice and you may become a disciple to one who shall in time have a name equal to Xenophanes Colophonius, the very founder of the philosophy of ethics. You have youth on your side, and you may one day be a Permenides, a Melissus, or a Zeno Eleates. I will open my mind to you on this matter at large hereafter, but at present I will follow the example of those ancient naturalists, Empedocles, Anaximenes and Heraclitus, who in the words of the learned Bacon, `mentem rebus submiserunt,' therefore until fitting time I will drop the matter, so bridle your desires; for to restrain our passions, to command ourselves, is the first great step marked out for the philologist and philosopher—without such power one is but an onsophist. But to branch from this subject; you know the foundation of my claims to the lands of 'Brom Plank, do you not think I must recover? law, right, every thing are with me—the blind decision made on the subject already doth not test the points of the case: for instance, what can be more plain—old Abraham Isaacs Plank bought of Governor William Kieft, and was seized in fee tail on the first day of May 1638, of certain lands, messuages, and tenements situate at Paulus Hoek and in the city of Nieuw Amsterdam. Now old Plank had two daughters, Gollotje and Marie; Marie died intestate, so her right fell to the next of kin, who was Gollotje; her first husband was Luyckes Tienhoven, by whom she had lawful issue. Now mark me, young man, I am Gollotje's second husband, and guardian to her children, and therefore by right of marriage heir to the Plank estate; now adverse possession is held of that estate by certain persons, who set up title as they affirm by right of purchase, and pretend to show old Plank's deed therefor: but mark my words, young man, he never gave a deed; my wife says she can swear to that fact—but they would not receive her evidence; only think of that—damn my cap, only think of that, they would not take my wife's oath—the deeds are forgeries —I know it—old Plank never put his hand to parchment —he was a real cautious old Dutchman, too shrewd for that. Such proceedings, such law as I have had is enough to try one's patience—enough to make one blaspheme; but I never swear except when I am in a passion, and I flatter myself I am too much above the cares of this world to get ever in a passion about any thing: but only to think, young man, they would not take my wife's oath —however I have appealed”— To what further duration the old man would have spun his untiring theme, is scarce to be determined; for there seemed neither bound nor medium in his discourse, the very frenzy of which was apparent in its protraction, which grew in rapid changes, from the strange and fickle ideas that shifted alternate in his unstable mind, while with grave deportment, his lips seized and ushered forth, every wild thought that for a moment prevailed paramount in his disturbed brain. His condition was truly such as of the many doubtful maniacs, who, harmless in a manner, to all, except such as whose time and patience they engross with the rehearsing of speculative fancies, are suffered to roam at large, rendering their infirmity at most times visible, by their ridiculous conceit in forwarding their own learned qualities, plans and projects on public endurance, to the exclusion of matters of more moment;—I mean that class of personages, who, blinded to reality, and opinionative as to their own powers, deem themselves, in their own idea, persons of considerable consequence; and therefore, presuming that they are of equal importance in the eyes of every body, and that their affairs are those of the world at large, they believe they have a right to demand of others, to suspend all business until they are possessed of their personalities and own immediate concerns. Indeed the manner of the ancient, wherewith he confined the service of the wearied and half angered youth, partook much of this last feeling; and, albeit, he would not suffer him the chance of speech, yet he would not allow (such was the sage's greediness of attention) his hearer's eye to wink from the subject on which he debated, or his diligence of listening, to relax for an instant,—for whenever he perceived the visage of the half distracted stripling turn from him with vexation and impatience, with a sudden and pettish clutch at the boy's gabardine, he would command his heed to the outpourings of his inexplicable theories. Happily, however, for the relief of the distressed Arnyte, at the moment when the philosopher (from the failure of whose breath, which was of apparently an unrelenting source, and to the giving out of which, to his helpless captive, for such the youth might truly be accounted, there was no hope of rescue) had pronounced the latter words, which is above narrated, his further perambulation of speech was prevented, by the interruption of to him, doubtless, an 19* unwelcome intruder. The appearance of the person who now made himself a party to the scene, by thrusting himself unceremoniously between Arnyte and his tormentor, was singular, and in somewise differed from that of most of the tenants of the prison house: he was a man of the middle height, of a dark and foreign aspect, a body shriveled, dried, and withered to the very bone—and his dusky complexion, in no way lessened by an unshorn beard of the blackest hue, while from his person and flesh, every appearance of cleanliness was absent: round his head, instead of a night cap, was twisted, in an ungainly fashion, a dirty and soiled handkerchief of an eastern figure, the brightness of whose once vivid and flaring colours, was now departed and lost 'mid stains and filth: he had carelessly wrapped about him, an old, faded, flowered, damask morning gown, lined with silk that might have once been green, but in which now, varied streaks of yellow and blue, contended with its original die. Through the opening folds of this, could be discovered a tabbinet waistcoat, edged with high wrought lace—but the filthy condition of this garment, equalled that of the other portions of his dress—the whole of which, to the well worn velvet slippers, was sprinkled with divers gouts of that delicious powder of the Indian weed, wherewith each moment, his fingers fed with plenteous kindness, his huge nostrils —nathless, not unmindful in smearing therewith his upper lip, on which, many stray particles lingered at each replenishment—so that at a short distance, it might have been supposed he wore a huge, untrimmed mustache: between his lips he held a merschaum, or smoking tube, of Belgian manufacture, from the pipe of which, he devoured with such avidity the essence of the herb it contained, that even while speaking, he forbore to withdraw it from his mouth—so that his natural broken accent and language, was rendered thereby even more unintelligible and thick and husky. “Mon sacre dieu, misericorde, for vy you persecuter dis pauvre garcon vid votre absurdité, Monsieur Isaaq?” exclaimed the stranger, as he intervened his person between the sage and the suffering victim of his tediousness, “ma foi! parbleu! dis enfant no comprend—dat is, no see de profundite of votre philosophie—dat is, en verite, Monsieur, as dat is in der promise of le grand monarque ou le Duc de Bouillon—ah ha! Monsieur, sometime votre singularite make my recollecshon hav de memorie dat vas say by un mareschal de France qu'un sot l'embareassoit quelquefois plus qu'un habile homme— ah ha!” “By the light of philosophy, Jean Beartie, this is provoking,” quoth the sage, with a voice somewhat deformed with petulance in replication. “Damn my cap, Jean, but you are the most troublesome, ignorant and officious fellow, in the ward; here I was particularly engaged with this young man, who is not like you, but a sensible youth, and listens patiently to maxims of wisdom—and I am well willing to render him the assistance of my mature experience, in the paths of his improvement—for what, saith the learned Bacon, is the trite adage of the Roman, but that one cluster of grapes ripeneth best beside another? and beatius est dare quam recipere,—but why need I explain to thee, whose mind is of the baser metal, and who holdest to the poor maxim of the poet Pindar, that water is the best—yet nathless, it is well for one like me, that by the like of thee, huguenot, I am persecuted, teased and pestered: yet I am a meek man, a suffering patient man, as well becometh that which I have studied—and I have borne from the vulgar, until it may be said of me—do you mark my words—tu ne cede malis sed contra audentior ito.” “Mesericorde! mesericorde! Monsieur, mon ami,” returned Jean Beartie, with a significant shrug of the shoulder, and a potent application of sustenance to the nostril, “mon dieu! for vy you go off vid de grand feu—ah ha? non, non, what you call dat in der language Anglais? ah ha—der grand passion—parbleu! Monsieur Izaaq, je suis votre ami por I'honneur de Provence, en verite. I have come to tell you for you self, non bon pour me—non, non, en verite! dat votre fren —votre ami—dat hav his chambre vid you—misericorde! hav de deshonneur to take away your bit souper dat you save vrom votre dejune and mange—dat is, eat him up pour himself—a ha—en verite.” “Damn my cap, can it be possible!” cried the ancient like one thunderstruck, and with an unaccustomed brevity of speech. “Cest possible, Monsieur mon ami, cest vrai as dat is the promise of le grand monarque ou le Duc de Bouillon,” said the huguenot with the utmost indifference, cramming his nose with the food for which it was apparently at all times hungered, and of which, no quantity, however large, seemed unacceptable. “Damn the knave, I'll—I'll—no matter, this is the ingratitude of man—but I must bear it—but to think, I put my soup, my bread, so nicely away for to-night—death and destraction! has he devoured it all?” cried the vexed philosopher, forgetting both his precepts and his stoicism in his perplexity. “I vill no be certain of dat—non, non—mon ami—je voir him at votre souper ven I leave de chambre—une, non, non—deux littel minute dat is pass, Monsieur—a ha! en verite!” answered Jean, at all times using a hundred strange grimaces and convulsive contortions of countenance, whereby at each breath, he eked out the meaning he was scarcely capable of expressing, by his limited knowledge of the language he attempted, to convey his sentiments. The enraged philosopher waited to hear no more— but unmindful of his intended disciple, and even of gravity in his deportment at departure, he burst away with an air of vengeance, towards his cell, leaving his companions, as befitted the extremity of the occasion, without further word. “A ha, ma foi! dat man hav de littel love at him coeur vor himself, as der philosophie, en verite!” said Jean Beartie, with a sly grin and lift of the shoulders, as he cast his eyes after the ancient, “mon dieu, him gesier—him gizzar like him no hav etudie der philosophie—a ha! en verite—apropos,” continued he, suddenly turning to Arnyte, and supplying his nostrils almost at every word—“mon bonne garçon—mon littel garçon —him gone—tell me—tell you fren—votre ami—vy you put here in dis prisone—a ha? you guerriere you take you pistolet and shoot von man trou de head—a ha—en verite—you petit brave homme—me see dat vid vone eye, a ha, en verite,” here he paused a moment, and having given, during the activity of his fingers, a long and inquisitive glance at the boy, he resumed, “vat dat is not as Jean Beartie say—cest non vrai—cest possible, ma foi—a ha —den you take de largent, de louisd'or, de monies, mon dieu, vrom the gentilhomme vat hav it in him 'poche—in him pockets, a ha—en verite—ma foi, je voir—I preceive you hav de monies—Jean Beartie you fren till him mort as vone rousty nail—a ha—en verite—pour I'honneur de Provence, Jean Beartie vill take de bon garde—de— vat you call him in der Anglais—a ha, en verite—der attention of you monies, till you get out vrom dis prisone; you give Jean Beartie some littel recompense, den he take de bon care of you healt—mon dieu! you sall sleep—you sall mange—dat is Francois vor eat him—you sall dancez—you sall chantez, as dat you was fly wid de littel rouge gorge, vat—vat de diable you call him in language Anglais—parbleu—to joomp —a ha—en verite—in der spring chantez, in der branches vertes—cest vrai, as dat is der promise of le grand monarque ou le Duc de Bouillon.” “You are much in error,” quoth Arnyte calmly, “I, my good sir, am not in the situation, or of the character you suppose—but indeed, I am an unhappy, an unfortunate youth; and it is only the idea there are others more dear to me than myself, who are suffering worse than it is my lot, that keeps me up against the power of my evil fortune. I am the son, the only son, now alas, living, of Jacob Leisler, so late powerful in this province; but now, a deserted prisoner, pining in grief, much I fear me, in this dreary, horrible place.” “Mon dieu! je comprendez vous—mon petit bonne garcon,” replied Jean Beartie readily, “you com see you fader, a ha, en verite—Je voir, cest vrai—you fader was une grand homme, une gentilhomme, une gouveneur. Je comprendez, on dit him ver riche, a ha—en verite—I mak you fader agreable commode in dis prison as dat him in der rue dat is by der porte, pour I'honneur de Provence. Ma foi, I giv you fader vor him sleep my little couverture—him clean, him nice, him no dirt, him warm vor him healt, a ha, en verite—den vor dis I no want non remerciement—no thank en verite—I do dis vor noting, a ha—parbleau! den somedime—you give me now one, two, tree louisd'or—vat you call dat, a ha— en verite—guilder, vor my punition be finis here in dis prison, in vone—quartre mois—den I go vere I com to der ville Montreal, and I keep von confectionare, von littel confectionare, vere de gentilhomme mange der bonbon, a ha—en verite—cest vrai mon petit garcon, as dat is der I'honneur de grand monarque ou le Duc de Bouillon.” “All that I have power will I extend in return for your promised kindness, good friend,” said the stripling, “but an you would fill the measure of your charity even in the onset, at once conduct me to the dungeon of my parent; I pray you proceed.” “Je voir der attachement dat der fil hav vor votre fader, bon, a ha, en verite,” said the huguenot, thrusting with many contortions of visage, his hand well plenished to his nose, “vat Jean Beartie say is vrai, no lie, ma foi.” “I prithee, kind sir, dally not with my impatience, but lead me to my father's presence.” The Canadian, however, seemed to linger, somewhat expectant of something more passing between him and the stripling, ere he listed in his service; but perceiving the inattention to whatever was the subject of his thoughts manifested by the anxious youth, and possibly unwilling from hopes of future benefit, to offend his new acquaintance, after a disappointed shrug, in which his head and body nearly met, and a long recourse to a frequent and accustomed solace, which he generally derived from an extra supply to his devouring nostrils of the vivacious powder, on which he seemed as it were alone to exist, he bade the youth follow him, and proceeded towards the farthest end of the hall; while the manner with which the huguenot bore himself as he went, attracted the attention of him whom he conducted; who gathered from the man's behaviour more than from words, that he was in higher favour with the keeper and his satellites than his fellow prisoners; and that he was endued with some authority over the hapless tenants of the hall—for at almost every step the caitiff took he exercised the utmost insolence of petty tyranny upon some haggard wretch, who was even in appearance deserted by friendship, influence, and hope; while again, with all the fawning hypocrisy of the sycophant, he greeted others, perhaps without regard to crime, but rather means of purchasing his favour and as they stood with his masters, with speech fair and kind. Truly this man was one of that class of criminals who are singled out, chosen for their apt and genial disposition by the keepers of prisons, to serve their vilest views, as well as to further their brutal cruelty. A convict himself, he was so situated as to worm himself in the confidence of his fellows—to dive into their views and plans, and then in spite of oath, word, or conscience, or aught terrible and sacred even with the worst of men, he would hasten to report all except such as he concealed more for his own interest, to the keepers, who encouraged his villany, and rewarded him therefor with privileges they withheld from any other in the prison house: and with persecutions severe and inveterate against such as he disliked, to forward which his reports were most times aided by fictions of his own coinage rather than what really chanced, he was like one of those last ravens who hover at a distance over the slain, and watch until the ban dog and heath fox have banquetted their fill, ere attempting to descend and pick the remnants of flesh and feed upon the nearly bare bones of the dead—which in this feast become peeled to very nakedness. Having approached the last of the range of cells, the Frenchman pointed it out as that wherein Leisler was confined. “Dere, mon fren, mon petit Monsieur,” said he, “allez vous et que dieu vous conduisse, donnez consolation à pauvre pere—ah misericorde! Je voir votre visage—it no look like consolation, ma foi! wid der sang, de rouge blood all over of him. Mon dieu! how com dat? you combattez, a ha? Je comprend; den I vipe him in von littel minute, you sall see, a ha, cest vrai;” so saying he took the end of his morning gown, which was by far the most filthy looking part of the garment, and before Arnyte could refuse the intended kindness, he ran it over that part of the youth's face which was daubed with stains of gore, the marks of the blow received from the hand of Mynheer Stoutenbergh; “dere, you no see him one littel bit pour I'honneur de Provence,” continued the huguenot, “him blanc as der fluer de lisle of le grand monarque; ma foi! mon petit garcon allez vous a pauvre pere. Jean Beartie no can go vid, him must garde de gentilhomme in der salle. Ven you fader don vid you, you call Jean Beartie—you comprend? den he com, a ha! cest vrai; as is de promise le grand monarque ou le Duc de Bouillon.” As Arnyte paused before the dungeon of his father, he scarce recked the words spoken by his conductor, but his eye busied itself in search for the revered form, in its darksome recesses, with glances wild, and rapid as those with which the wood-pigeon regards the movements of the fowler—There is no passion that debases the more generous sentiments of the human frame, and brings the finer feelings of mankind to the very level of brutality, and gives greater scope for display of the savageness of our nature, than of that seated hatred which hath its rise from political enmity, particularly when chance grants power to extend its venom on such as heretofore hath soared upwards and baffled (with fortune at their side) every evil wish: in the conqueror's treatment of Leisler, that demoniac feeling of ever pursuing revenge was most apparent by the manner and place of his confinement; the object was easy to be perceived—it was to bring down to degradation and contempt in the eye of the world, him who late had been so loftily placed; as if the forced companionship of felons and murderers—the imprisonment in a common Bridewell, were of such power as to destroy the man, and render him infamous in society; forgetful that while his actions (which they desired to be considered as most criminal) were yet in memory, that they but discovered to the impartial and reflecting the depth of their own weakness and pitiful malevolence, without the slightest injury to their enemy by the intended contamination; and this seemingly was soon felt by the authors of this conduct themselves, for the foemen of Leisler soon grew discontented with this first course of wreaking their angry feelings, and sought excuses for it, by stating that it was but in return for the manner they themselves had been served when in Leisler's hands; and with their disappointment, their appetite grew ravenous for sating their long felt evil will, and it was not long ere they thirsted for blood; and this their victims unfortunate durance proved but the melancholy note of preparation to that woeful tragedy that is hereafter related, and which stains the annals of the province—in conformity with every part of the usage of their prisoner, the myrmidons of Leisler's enemies, possibly believing they were doing a pleasure in their masters' eyes, or at least with their encouragement, heaped on him every ignominy and insult their ingenious minds could invent—more dank and dismal than its fellows was his cell—the most loathsome beings that prison could produce were lodged with him, and he was denied such comforts as the vilest felon was allowed—bad as were the others, the place where Leisler was confined was as it were the very receptacle of filth and vermin from the other dens—Arnyte whose heart had leaped joyously at the announcement of his proximity to his father, looked for a moment in vain within the dungeon bounds, and then drew back horror stricken with that which met his sight, and almost overpowered with the foul and heavy air he breathed, for an instant he was unable to proceed—“Great God!” he cried, wringing his hands and leaning for support to his sinking frame against the door-way—“is this so indeed—I had no thought—no idea—no dream of this—too certain my eyes are mocked—can this be—can this be”— Among the squalid group of wan, haggard, and emaciated forms that were huddled in the precincts of the cavern, the quick and eager vision of the anxious stripling, marked (while as he looked every pulse trembled with indistinct and uncertain fears) the figure in particular of one man—he was seated on the bare hard flooring of the cell, but seemingly he recked little of outward sufferance—or Vol. II. 20 his face was buried in his hands as if in grief or reflection —the marks of years were on his brows, and his hair was dishevelled and matted as by neglect, and then his garments were ragged—but apparently not with wear or time, the rather as torn by some wanton hand in fray, for they hung in numerous and lacerated strips that scarce concealed the naked body of the wearer—Arnyte gazed, and his heart throbbed fast, and with tremulous beatings knocked at his ribs, for there was something in the air, form, and character of him on whom his sight rested that spoke to his very soul, and yet he knew not, he doubted much that one in such piteous plight; that a shape of such hopeless wretchedness could be him he sought—the man slowly raised his head—it was indeed the unfortunate Leisler —but his face was so pallid and care-worn—so different from the burley visage which he had worn but in the early evening of the past night, that none scarce but the searching eye of affection could have recognized those altered looks—the step of Arnyte as he rushed in the dungeon faltered, and he could but stagger to his parent's feet —“Father, dear father,” alone burst from his lips as he flung his arms about the old man's neck— “Father, dear father, look upon thy son,” continued the youth after a moment's pause, “he is here, as he should be, at thy side—at the side of him who gave him birth; he hath come to bear with thee the evil tides of fortune; he hath come, as he ought, to stand by thee through weal, through wo; father, dear father, look upon thy child.” But yet the parent spoke not to his offspring; deadlier pale had grown his countenance, and his teeth were fixed and strongly set together; but his eye alarmed, for it was distended with a look unconscious, wild and glassy; so still, stirring not and motionless, did he sit, that one might have supposed him frozen at the instant, to a powerless and inanimate form, upon the spot. “Why is this! what have I done, that thus the vials of wrath should be poured to the very drain, upon my head?” exclaimed the terror-stricken youth, dashing himself upon the ground beside his parent, in despair, “alas, where will my miseries end; oh, father, dear father, know you me not? I am him whom you were wont to call your joy—your hope—your blessing: you have told me an hundred times, that the sight of me gave you new life in age; ah, me, it appeareth to have killed thee, rather.” He took his father's cold hand and pressed it to his lips, his brows, and his bosom;—“ah,” sighed he, “my heart strings are tough, that they crack not, for much have I endured.” Leisler's breast heaved slowly—his hands, that had been clenched as in death, relaxed their stern gripe— his lips laboured, and a trembling ran through his frame, shaking it like the limbs of an ague stricken infant, and he burst out at length into a wild and hysterical laugh, which his surcharged feelings soon changed, as hey vented themselves in a passionate flood of tears. Within the dungeon, during this brief action, the wonted voice of wo and lamentation, coarse ribaldry, and hollow hearted merriment, that mocked, like the sound of music at a funeral feast, the actual suffering of the place, was stilled—and the harsh and iron hearted men of outlawry and of crime, stood there in silence, and looked on the scene in strange amazement; and while the most hardened and unfeeling gazed with no throb of heart, but with derisive eye, and lip of sneering mockery—mayhap for a moment there was some solitary wretch, unvisited of hope or comfort, to whom the sight brought back the long lost tenderness of memory, of shunning friend or parent, from whom unrepented crime had banished and severed every natural tie, and brought neglect alone, whether in disease, sickness or death—for such are often the bitter and miserable fruits of unthinking profligacy. “Mien kind—mien zon—mien eyes are broken with old age; I zee not regt,” quoth Leisler at last, as his fast, heavy and blinding tear-drops trickled on Arnyte's bosom, “I'd dort I was alleen in de waareld—but 'tis niet zo—'tis niet zo—mien kinder is mit me—mien braaf kinder, dat zeeks hish old vader in hish hartzeer mit der komfort of hish liefde.” “Yes, father,” returned the youth, “the growth of thy flesh, the sapling of thy root, is not such as composed the herd that trooped around thy holiday fortunes; he hath joyed in the sunshine that o' late was on thy name; but darkness, which now sits above our house, hath not changed thee to him; ah yes, thou art still my parent; am I not a part of thy very self? am I not a branch of the very tree that derives its existence from the trunk? the woodman's knife may lop away from the oak its limb; the tempest, in its rage, may sweep it from its hold; but can it then live? ah no, it is withered to death by the very parting; the way hath been cheerless, stormy and rugged, but I am here; even with thee, in thy dreary prison.” “Mien zeer kind, dis is well—regt well,” said the old man after an interval, in which he fondly perused the lineaments of the stripling's countenance, and held his hand with the strong lock of affection, “de groodt God rebay dien waard—vor dien szweed vace makes mien hertz glad in mien zorrow—ja—ja! Arnyte, dou be'est de sday op mien lieveen, mien goed kind! inderdaad I have zufferred zince last I zee de, boy—but it is bast— it is over, now I looks into dine eyesh, I am gelukkig— I am bleased mit mien lot.” He apparently endeavoured to lighten his features with a faint smile, as he continued, “dis blace is niet zo bad—a klien koud and schrikkelyk—dat's niet to a mensch—still dis is nien dreatment vor a Nederlandt burgher, mien zon!” To this last mournful and indignant observation, Arnyte could give no answer of solace or of soothing, for the gloomy prospect around, and the mean and spiteful injustice of Leisler's foes, was too glaring in all its naked and horrid truth, to admit of palliation, or of future hope; it was too palpable, that the reins of their passions were unloosed; that unless some curb or boundary, was soon placed on their progress of persecution, that it would be hard to tell what would be the fearful close of their actions against the object of their venomous feelings, unprotected and abandoned to their merciless revenge. The youth clung to his father's shoulders, droopingly and in silence—while the old man seemed roused by the thought of all he had undergone, and of the insults which he was yet bearing from his enemies, from the usual timid and lethargic manner, which had been his principal characteristic, and which had so long made him the passive tool of deeper and more designing politicians.” “By myn trouwe!” said he at last, while the sore anguish awakened in his heart from the mischances he had so recently sustained, alike with the bitterness of his attempted humiliation, brought words of anger more rapid to his lips, and with a force beyond his accustomed hesitating utterance and lack of thought, he spoke as if the endurance of adversity had granted power of speech uncommon to his heavy lip; and such hath been remarked with wonder in men of slow and laborious character, and uncultivated minds, that in the depth of their sorrows, or in moments of need and stress, their tongues, as it were, have been unloosened, and an eloquence far above them hath flowed forth, like some lazy rivulet swoln by mountain rains, bursting to the amazement of those who on its borders dwell, the barriers at whose sides it had heretofore slept in veriest gentleness.—“By myn trouwe!” quoth he,—“by the ashes of my dead mother!” exclaimed the burgher in the language most familiar from his infancy, and abandoning the broken utterance of his vain attempts at by him the less used speech of the conquerors of the Nieuw Nederlandts;—“by the ashes of my dead mother,—I swear, were I a rogue for the leash, worse I had not been used; sooth, the dungeon wherein Andross cast me when I stood as burgomaster of Albany against his innovation on the Classes of Amsterdam, was a stadtholder's palace to this hole;—were I a dog,—a drove and beaten dog, I would sicken at this hovel and rot upon a common dunghill, rather than bear its loathsomeness—and then,—and then—but I'll not fret me, for it pleases them; it is to make these eyes of mine forget themselves and send forth tear-drops, that thus I am treated; and then they'll shout at my childishness—but I'll not do it—no, no! they shall wring blood first from my heartstrings—great God! and have they not done it 19* —miserable old man! the sins of all thy life hath been punished in one hour—Milbourne—my rash,—my bold, —my brave one, where art thou now! Oh villains!— murtherous, bloody hounds, the waters of the Amstraccan will not wash thy stained hands clean from the deed thou hast foully done—and where sleeps the laggard lightnings; of old, it hath shot down even at the altar's base—why not now? But what help—from that—fool! fool—what can give thee back thy daughter's husband, thy son!—what then dost complain of—wild, doting, childish man;—alas! my heart aches bitterly: if but this doth come of all my fortunes, better,—far better had I never seen light of life, than thus to be abandoned, thus left alone, in sorrow and in solitude.” And he sat down on the floor from which he had started, while he poured out the hot o'erflowings of his burthened bosom, and beat his breast, and wrung his hands, in all the agony of grief. With many long and vain attempts, and anxious breathings of comfort that his pallid cheek and watery eye belied, did Arnyte strive to still the perturbed feelings of his afflicted parent; but fruitless were his endeavours, until the torrent of his grief had passed away; and then a stern calm followed which was even more frightful than the loud railings of the storm that had disturbed him, and with its violence, shaken every nerve. As the youth gazed with fearful look upon the still stern and fixed visage of Leisler, the words of hope and solace that he had called to his mind died away upon his trembling lips, even at the utterance. “Fond boy—fond boy,” muttered Leisler, grasping with despairing violence the hand of his son, “you know not what you say; you are young, and dream not what bad men may do; you speak of change—of better times to come;”—and he laughed wildly as he spoke—“death will come first; know I not those whom I deal with? they have tasted blood—Milbourne's blood. Think ye they will be content?—no, boy, no! thou knowest not what they will do; their thirst of hate will not be quenched, (I deem it so from their nature;) while life courses in these veins,—while my voice hath strength to make a rallying word against them; yes, this prison-house betokens the commencement of their mercies;—where think you it will end?—why, in the grave, when the sod of the burial ground is laid upon this head,—when the wine cup passes round at my funeral, and I am but as a clod, unenvied by the lowest wretch in life.” “Death! my sire,—nay thou speakest not of death?” inquired Arnyte, while a fearful shudder shook his frame; “you do not deem they have the power—the fell purpose to dare so vile an act! life rests not with them.— Great God! you cannot think they will attempt a measure unheard of, where there hath been no crime. The law of the land is not a reed, to bend the way they choose to turn it; if it is, out on it for a mockery—ay, every thing malice can devise may be dreaded, but they surely have not the wickedness of that which would bring on their heads the scathing bolt of heaven's wrath.” “No matter—boy—no matter—worry not thyself upon the thought,” returned with affected calmness the devoted burgher, “it is not worth thy tear—I reck not for the worst they may do—cheer thee Arnyte, for an the last ill come, they shall not see us grieve—my enemies shall not triumph in a groan of mine—no! I'll not flinch from their tortures—not an atom; an as though a seated and embedded rock, this frame shall stir not for wind or wave.” Slow and heavily did the wearisome hours of sorrow move o'er the inmates of the prison, while sad and comfortless (for sunken even in spite of the utmost endeavours at resolution were the hearts of both the father and his son,) was their dreary converse—they sat with hands clasped in each other's in fond affection, unriven by misfortune, and aye glancing on each other's care-worn countenance with looks that spoke far more than words; now and then a tear-drop blinded the sight of the boy as he gazed on the furrowed face of his parent; but the orbs of the old man were hot, burning, and dry as a fountain channel in the desert when the Simoon had passed—a stern and melancholy darkness of mind was on them unbroken by a glimmer of light. And now the solitary and desolate prisoner, who shun ning the herd of his mates to look on the heaven and waters, for whose liberty his heart yearned, and breathe the rushing of another atmosphere through the casement pane, and rusted gratings of his dungeon window, marked as he counted the close of another day of durance, (which noted on his calendar, in length as it were a year,) the light of the sky gorw dull without, and the deep, and dusky glow of the setting sunbeam tinging with a long streak of crimson hue, the deep and transparent waves of the Oost vloed that flowed in front of the stadt-huis slip, and shedding a misty glory over the solemn woods that lined the opposite shores of New Yorkshire[23] [23] One of the ancient names of Long Island. —whose bold beach looked like ruins, with stern crags and hoary rocks that rose from out the brown and reddish tufts of autumnal fern in vast masses, upon whose bare, bleak summits sudden and awful shadows dwelt like dark clouds from out the waters, through which now and then like snow flakes the sea-fowl showered their white wings, scouring and wheeling in mid air, anon dipping in the moving waves—slowly the mist grew closer, and clouds of night, black and swelling, hung on the utmost verge of the darkening horizon, in the breaks of which the eye could trace here and there the outlines and shapes of river craft drawing themselves away in the distance, seeming with their white sails like birds flitting before the coming night; while the living sea swept by the breezy air ran rapidly along like a wild and bounding steed—awhile and it grew darker, and the clumsy dutch vessels at the slip's heads, which but a moment before were distinguishable with their huge black masts, their bows and stems rising high above the centre of the deck, and their small cabin windows sunken and inserted in their structure like the eyes of a sheep's head, mingled in one formless, shapeless mass, beyond which only here and there afar out the eye could catch glimpses of the river through the gathered night; and then started to life the cabin lights which dotted the wave far around, like sparkling stars; the bondsman's mind painted them as happy glow-worms disporting at large—and as the boatmen's voice of revelry, which continued long after the city bell had tolled the hour of rest, rose to his ears from the anchored batteaux, he sickened at the joy of others, and with a heavy heart turned in the charnel gloom of his darksome dungeon—there no longer he could distinguish the savage and desperate visages of his associates, for the darkness of the sepulchre was there; but ever and anon as he crouched him down upon his hard straw, breaking the sleep he sought to woo, there brokeon his ear the horrid imprecation—ferocious oath—and the hollow rattle of chains and gyves—recalling to the mind, which would have winged itself away to rest in deep unconsciousness, the body's bondage, and the dreadful place that enclosed him—and then too, though many a callous ruffian dozed quietly as an infant dreaming in its purity on its mother's bosom, there were some, now that thought was no longer guiled with the sports or pursuits to which to drown reflection day had been devoted —who shivered as the aspen as their evil deeds thronged on their busy brain, and shuddering superstition played its dire pranks, and their blood grew ice even at the horror of their own minds;—for indeed there are some men so fashioned and textured by nature's hand, so timid from birth and raising, that it wants not truth in punishments of after life that monkish legends teach, to visit on them justice for their crimes—and there are those who in the broad day wantonly and boldly defy every right of law—whether of the divinity or of mankind—yet at the still and solemn hour of midnight, have felt the beaded drop of fear course on their sullen cheeks, and undergone all the anguish of awakened remorse—the pricking of an angered conscience;—and now all was silence in that prison save the deep and heavy breathing of the sleepers, and ever and anon the half stifled moan of such whose sufferings and sorrows dwelt even with him in the visions of the night and gave him no rest; or the groan of the burthened heart of one on whose eyes no sleep could come;—the sight of Leisler and Arnyte, the father and his child were closed, and they lay folded in each other's arms upon the cold damp floor—no cover guarded them from the searching night air—no hand of tenderness smoothed their pillow, but the grey hairs of age and the black locks of youth mingled on the iron stanchions that bound the dungeon floor—there they lay, the boy's arms clung fondly (like the ivy wreath around the oak's trunk) about the parent's neck, whose one arm pillowed the youth's head, while his other drew him closer to his breast, and the father's lip rested on the clear and snowy forehead of his son; so bound together in that silent embrace, they seemed, those two, the one bound as it were, to the heart of the other—like bright and blooming spring, upon the bosom of hoary winter; and they slept—yet amid the soft breathings of the stripling, ever and anon, there came a sigh, low but painful, showing that sorrow was at the heart, and mingled with the sweetness of his sleep; and on the long eyelash there hung a little tear drop, that, ere the eye had closed, had moistened it, like a bead of dew lingering at nightfall on the leaves of the violet; but the old man's rest was sound, deep and heavy; he appeared unconscious of all that had befallen him, for the time, as though he had been stretched upon a couch of downy softness, instead of that rough floor. Even so, might it be said, that innocence sleeps, alone rewarding the good when pressed by misfortunes, and overwhelmed by the raging tempest of the world, had there not been at hand, a stern contradiction of the fair theory, a reality that laid in ashes as by the devouring flames, the sweet fabric built by the busy hand of virtue, to support its cause; for could the sight have parted in light the darkness of that dungeon gloom, it would have marked the placid countenances and unbroken sleep of many, stained with the blackest crimes man is capable of perpetrating; and there was one, who couched almost at the side of that pure hearted pair— a man of wicked deeds—a ruthless ruffian, with hands incarnadine—and yet his visage was clear and open as day itself; honesty, frankness, and nobleness of nature, seemed settled on his brow, and his dreams, his sleep, judging from his looks, were as sweet as that of youth when pillowed on the breast of love. And is it not truly so? A few, indeed, may suffer amid the great crowd of mankind, the sore agonies of remorse, as though a viper sucked the heart; but how many more appear to grow hourly more and more callous, if they be not born dead to every compunction of conscience, and flinch from no pang, except such as is drawn forth from the severing of their outward flesh, or the loss of the blood that feeds their sluggish veins—and yet they prate; the churchman preaches, for it is his duty; and the dull moralist teaches, (though both know the hollowness of their doctrines, which should be sound and true, but are not,) the honours that attend an honest life, and the glories of an unspotted mind; albeit, it is but a sophism; how many honest men, the practisers of the theory, sink in the grave, beneath the persecutions of their fellow, after a most miserable life, the close of which, was its happiest hour? hath the world, yea, the civilized world, been known to give a man bread for his honesty? hath it respected him the more—show when? Hath he for a trait of virtue, been exalted above his fellow? The examples, if any, are solitary ones, to which a thousand of the opposite cast could be set off; nathless, virtue seemeth but a holiday theme for dying dotards, school boys, and for the carving of an inscription for a tombstone; and where is the proof that it is no lie? go to the burial ground; doth not the relics of the villain, lay as peaceful as the best? doth the sod that covers him, tremble and heave under the treading foot? doth not the young flowret climb from his turf, as lovely as from that of another? doth not his children enjoy in happiness, the fruits of his multitudinous wrongs to his fellow? and yet it is of the grave and its inhabitant, whether all ends there, or there is aught beyond it, on which every human maxim against vice and wickedness, is founded; then if death be but the herald to a state of altered being, the threshold of another life—the gate of entrance to a new existence—why should nature shrink with terror and affright, from its approach? why, as from the bound of a tiger, should we start from the thought of separation of animate being from the inert clay? and yet, who living, can assert the truth? what actual proof hath the astronomer, that it is not an ideal fantasy, when he proclaimed that every silvery spangle of the vast heaven, was a world, even like that in which we breathe? and who can look upon the corpse of him who was once quick like ourselves—in whose eye light shone—on whose cheek health wantoned—and in whose now palsied and stiffened limbs, were strength and action, and can show there is aught preserved, more than remains of the corrupt and passive matter, already a dwelling for the worms, loathsome to the sight, even of those who loved it but late, and for which, darkness, the tomb, and the damp earth, are alone fit receptacles. Alas! so impenetrable to us is the mist which parteth life and death, so little can we judge from the passages of life the true incentives of human events, of that which vice may dread and virtue hope, that the mind, wearied with the unsatisfied thought, at times may fly, perhaps not erroneously, to the wild idea that we are all creatures of some mighty puppet show, foredoomed our parts to act, and when that's o'er, e'en like the worthless images of wood, we drop down a cold, blank piece of nothingness—no more! * * * Suddenly, afar off within the building, there arose a hollow, rumbling sound, which gathered force in its approach, and rolling towards the outer door of the hall, broke with its noise upon the dreary stillness of the interior prison; and then it grew strong and more distinct, and now the loud clattering of footsteps was plainly heard, and at once three heavy and abrupt blows upon the iron that secured the lock of the exterior entrance of the hall, echoed sharply through the dungeons, startling from their sleep the drowsy inhabitants of each cell, who scarce awakened, gazed about them in the dreariness of the place with vacant and alarmed looks; and then a strong, coarse voice, which came from near the door, (as with words of friendly caution to such as might have been engaged in desperate strife to burst away the bonds that bound their cramped limbs, or had been labouring with increasing toil beneath the friendly shadow of the night, to break the securities of the prison, and give themselves that liberty the offended laws denied, or such as might from other causes, adverse to their safe keeping, dread the jailer's visit,) pierced with the echo of its cry the farthest nook of the prison-house—“the rounds, the rounds,”—it called; “douse ahead, douse ahead,—keep dark, or there'll be a team upon you.” The warning, like watchfire lit from cape to headland to tell the approach of an enemy, ran from lip to lip, and in an instant the ready file—the knife —the saw, and every implement of assistance which, defying the keeper's argus eye, had been by their associates who were without, conveyed to the prisoners, were concealed beyond search or discovery—and though anxious and awake, upon their pallets did the cunning convict lay, there was nought to be seen that could arouse suspicion. In a few moments the doors were opened, and their vacancy admitted Mienheer Stoutenbergh and his assistants, who, in addition to their usual attire, wore pistolets which bristled in the leather girdles about their waists; these were accompanied by four of the adelborsten, having their side-arms alone, and hearing huge torches, with which the steps of the whole party were lighted, and which, as they went along, cast a flickering and momentary glare upon the rude and rugged prison walls, and flashed with red and dusky hue upon the dark iron gratings around, whose openings were thronged with the frowning and ferocious visages of the criminals who herded in the inner cells, and who, alternately in light and mist, seemed like chattering and mowing fiends, that in the shadows of the sepulchre are seen by burial lamps; or, like the souls of the damned caged for the burning: at each cell the rounds stopped with harsh and brief words of greeting, —with curses or opprobrious epithets, not as discoursing to a human being, a member of civilized society, a man, but rather, as it were, some beast or obnoxious slave that was addressed, the party spoke to some of its inhabitants, while at the same time with hasty yet careful labour they struck the walls and irons, and ran over with quick glances every corner and nook of the gloomy den, even to shooting once or twice, to learn their safety, the bolts of the dungeon doors. Thus from cell to cell the party moved along, while as he listened to their coming, Vol. II. 21 the heart of Arnyte beat quickly with foreboding of evil, and trembling with terrors for miseries yet unknown, he almost ceased to breathe, as though the air from which he drank in life was pregnant with misfortune; at length the door of his father's dungeon was flung back, and Mynheer Stoutenbergh and his followers stood at the side of Leisler, who in the din and clatter that was around, lay silent, still, and motionless, so deep was the sleep that was upon his brows. “What ho! I say! Master Leisler—fico! old un, rouse thee, thou art as fast as a new padlock,” hoarsely cried, or rather bawled the jailer, in the ear of the dreaming burgher, at the same time roughly and unceremoniously shaking the old man by the shoulders. At the caitiff's violence the blood of Arnyte boiled in his veins; he could scarce restrain his rising choler at the sight of the unfeeling ruffian—prudence alone kept him in silence. “What, I say, the old dog dozes here as well as ever he did 'mid his grandeur up yonder in the fort; fico! I say, Dolph, between us, if I can see thro' a millstone, he'll sleep a deal sight sounder ere long, if hemp seed can make him easy: what think you, ha?—there'll be business for Tony De,” and the wretch grinned horribly as he spoke, on his associate, “but come, old un, get thee up; the court waits to try thee man, an withouten thee there'll be little or no sport.” Leisler, awakened by the rude salutation, abruptly raised himself upon his arm, and at first, with a wild, vacant, and startled gaze, looked about and on the faces that were peering over him, as unconscious for the moment of the place where he was, and of the persons by whom he was addressed and surrounded. “What seek you of the desolate?” said he, after a moment's pause, “Sooth! I had thought I had gone down to the grave, and was beyond the reach of sounds from human voice, or torture of man's presence.” “Fico, man! you must have your trial before you die, so don't be in a hurry,” quoth Mienheer Stoutenbergh in reply, “and the Court hath sent us for you, for they are waiting here in the stadthuis, though if it please you, old un, belike they'll make a short job of it, so get thee up, man and come along, for time wastes while we talk on the matter.” “By my troth!” said Leisler, starting in astonishment, “this is most strange! they have chosen a murky hour, thus at night, when half the city lays in sleep, to drag me to the presence of their judgment seat, with no friend or counsel near me; this lithe boy alone at my side to support my feeble step. Thou must mistake; it cannot be; there are laws to govern us—what! with no warning for preparation! no evidence to testify for me, or time to bring them! What hope have I in meeting accusations as yet unknown to me? What safety have I in innocence, thus driven, thus persecuted? but it is not hard to see their design; although inebriated and drunken with the conquest they have attained, they dare not face their victim when the world looks on: in the face of day they refuse me hearing; but thus, at this dread hour, black as their secret purposes, am I summoned, and—but no matter; lead on thy way, Mienheer, I am ready to attend thee.” As Leisler spoke, he uprose himself from the ground, but his motion was slow and painful, for his limbs were cramped and stiffened with the chill air of the night, that, with the damp, unwholesome vapours of the dungeon, and the iron hardness of the couch on which he had reposed, had stricken to his blood—and as he stood up, there came for a moment, and of a sudden, a dizziness upon his brain and mist of darkness on his sight, that in his weakness he had like to have fallen, for the objects about him seemed to swim along in his eye, like the shore in appearance to the passing mariner, and all things for the time looked dim and indistinct. “Mienheer, you totter and look faint,” said one of the soldiers, approaching the old man kindly, “you had better lean upon my arm; I can take guard of the torch, and also support your faltering steps, for we have not far to go to where the Court sits.” “Nay, friend, I thank thee; but I have a son left,” returned the burgher, recovering himself, “I had not thought there was so little strength in me—I have grown old in the last few hours; but it is not to be wondered at, misfortune saps us to the very core, and like a palsy withers up the vital springs of being—and in truth I am not much used to the fare I have just lived on—tears, tears,— heartaches, and a dungeon lodging were wont to be strangers to the name of Leisler: mine ancestors were burghers of Rotterdam an hundred years, and there stands no record against them, and yet I—but I'll not sorrow on it; no crime; they cannot bring a shadow of guilt against me— most faithful have I served their majesties of England, and these chains—mayhap a scaffold, are my reward! well, well, your hand, my boy; my aged frame, borne down with sorrow, more from the stings of ingrates than mine own sufferings, lacks prop.” “Come, master, it is fit you hasten,” said the jailer, in a surly and impatient tone. “I pray you pardon my forgetfulness,” replied Leisler, “Mienheer, I will go on with you.” The jailer now led the way and preceded Leisler, whose waning steps were upheld by the supporting arm of Arnyte, whose presence, either by design on the part of the jailer, or inattention from the more important circumstances in the business of the moment, excited neither surprise nor inquiry; the adelborsten with careful guard, followed close upon their progress, and two of them bared their swords and placed themselves nearer the prisoner as they wended from the prison wards into the body of the stadthuis; and as they walked along the passages of the place, the pace of Leisler quickened and grew firmer, for seemingly a new life sprung in his veins for the time as he heard and beheld the dark gate of that dismal place of penance, wherein he had pined, with its strong locks and massy bars closed behind him, and he was revived by the free air beating on his brow through casements where no dungeon impediments broke its wild and wanton course, and his hopes, and pride, and spirit, rose within him, contending against the sad realities that encompassed him like some wild fire entopping an opposing wall; albeit, he felt like the lion loosed and uncaged, and called to the gladiator's combat in the arena, scarce wotting, however nobly he bore himself, he was the doomed sacrifice; a victim marked for slaughter, unheard, untried. SECTION III. Judge. A heavy sentence, noble Philocles. And such a one as I could wish myself Off from this place, some other might deliver; You must die for it—death is your sentence. The Heir, a comedy. THE TRIAL. The persons who composed the commission of Oyer and Terminer which had been assembled to try Jacob Leisler, and to decide his fate on the accusations already charged against him by his active and inveterate enemies by direction of Governor Sloughter and his new sworn council, were convened together in a small dark room of the Stadthuis, in the gloomy, mean, and ill-lighted precincts of which there was but little that savoured of the high and solemn sitting of a court, that periled in that which it was about deliberating on, the life and honour of a fellow creature. The judges were seated around a table, in the centre of which was placed a dim and solitary lanthorn, through the close, thick, and dingy glass of which poured out the weak and prison rays that scarce pierced the dismal shadows of the apartment, rendering with their feeble gladness of light the cheerlessness of the place more striking; but where its nearer beams were thrown with more vividness of power on the countenances of those who were present, and who in deep and anxious converse huddled within its influence, it discovered in the speaking visages of the greater part, neither the cool and composed calmness of men firm in determination, nor the collectedness of aspect and demeanour to be expected from such, of whom was demanded fair and unmoved judgment, both as to the accuser and the accused. Various were the tell tale and convulsed movements of the 21* disturbed features of the majority of these men, bespeaking the hurry of alarm, fever of excited passion and hate timid anxiety and selfish care for their own preservation in the course they were called to pursue, that with busy thoughts shook their distracted minds; for although selected with caution requisite to the furtherance of their purposes by those inimical to the deposed ruler of the province, as persons in whom reliance could be placed in their absolute devotion to the views of the Bayard faction, yet so abrupt had been the change of public matters, that like a vision it could scarce be realized; but yesterday, the name of him whose fate was in their hands, to be disposed of now as suited the enmity of his foemen, was all powerful in the land—and yet within so brief a space of time as had passed, it had become a stigma and a reproach to be known his partizan: and then, too, without previous warning or preparation they had been called together—they had been suddenly and with haste summoned, their perturbed feelings having scarce time to tranquillize, from the late hurried violence and public irritation, to fulfil the fearful duty, and painful part of which there was not one, the most ignorant among them, who dared encourage himself was not already marked out for their performance; and that however clear of guiltiness, or even innocent of the shadow of committal of the crimes coined for his destruction and laid to his charge, that if the victim of the unhallowed persecution of unceasing and untiring revenge, was dismissed by their assent from the power of his enemies, and by their means was disentangled from his thraldom, untorn and unmangled by the eager hands of his angered adversaries, their actions could not have been such as were evidently expected from them, nor would be pleasant in the sight of those, who, from whom, if they did not immediately derive their stations and their consequence, were, in the least, the master spirits of the day, in whose presence all favour was gained and in whose smiles were rank and influence; and then too there were those elder and wary, to whom experience had taught the instability of popular opinion, the madness of decision founded on the sandy support of the prejudices that rule, however potent, yet but for the hour, the wavering passions of the crowd, unfaithful and changeable as the wind that sweeps with wanton career the crest of the sounding surge—whom years of endurance of the bitterness of disappointed calculation, of wrecked hopes, and shattered power, while like some fragile plank upon the stormy billow they swam the current of uncertain fortune, gathering wisdom from their own sufferance, had learnt how little faith could be placed, however favourable for the time the appearance of affairs, upon the steadiness of success, or the permanency of the elevation of any rival faction of the day; nor could doubts in the minds of such be banished that the party triumphant now might ere long yield its sway as quickly as it had conquered, to the one whose fugitive remnants were every where seeking safety in concealment, fallen and defeated. There was, therefore, in the manner of the many, who could the less easy from want of nerve conceal and cloak into the inmost recesses of their hearts, the secret disturbance of their thoughts, which was obvious to their companions, an unguarded vacillation, a fickle, nervous and hesitating temper, both in word and action; nevertheless, the cunning hand of the deepest and darkest policy had framed the Court to perfect the better its own hidden ends; well had been foreseen and cared for in its composition the various nature of its members: they were of mingled elements, mixed of good and ill, artfully giving the shadow of justice to the proceedings, which had, in truth, been catered out to their peculiar tools, by Bayard and his associates—in relief to the weak and undetermined, were stern and resolute men, the very sycophants of their superiors, who thought not, cared not for the future while revelling in the present sunshine, who, without will of their own, were ready to obey that command which was given them, and pursue to the very uttermost the road pointed out to them by those on whose skirts their fortunes hung; and although there were among the judges of that court one or two who were really honest, yet these were of that weak disposition as to be overawed and borne down by the active loudness of argument of their companions, although in giving way to their influence, they flattered themselves they were convinced of the rectitude of the course they were taking; these were of that class of men, honest, it is true, in intention, but who hush their consciences, and who, to their own love of ease and comfort, yield up to the more ardent in disputation the rights or lives of their fellows; nor, however despicable, is this species of being rare, the germ exists in this day—it is from men of this kind that the fallacy is proved of that which hath been so highly vaunted as the most perfect of human institutions, the boasted bulwark of civil and social liberty— the trial by jury; in which, withal its admirers have shown is alone exhibited how fleeting a reliance, how false the faith, and how uncertain the right which depend on the strength of virtue and the changeable and variable resolutions of mankind; for what can be more faithless than that which is ever open to the assaults of interest and of prejudice, and which being made up by numbers hath the less power to resist united the attacks of open corruption, or withstand being tampered with by insidious guiles and temptation. And however dangerous these, they are neither the only nor the worst influence which is to be dreaded in the minds of men taken as judges indiscriminately from the common crowd; there is among others, (and it is a fearful principle, a blot dark and deep, a vile deformity of nature, that with its general prevalence, like a leprosy, spreads to the heart, making it rotten to the very core,) that involuntary though natural bias of the mind, which is momently received by imperceptible seeds in its inmost recesses, from whence conviction itself cannot uproot its avidious hold. Prejudice is like that fatal disease, that in our northern clime wastes away our life like a waning lamp, and maketh fat the grave; its grasp is death, though the infatuated victim derides its power, and when nearest the most fearful hour of its strength, buoys itself up with hope of life, and dreams of health while palsied with sickness; so prejudice is drank in greedily, as it were in our very intercourse with the world and often when most we condemn it, we are more driven, by its fatal current—for it is the habitual idea which without the exercise of judgment, for this at such times is torpid until too late to be used, or be in the least efficacious, that ingrafts itself from common rumour, (and belief is ever ready to swallow aught monstrous, strange, or ill of our fellows) and from the information of others upon the pliant thought, it is the sense of the multitude which the wisest uses as his own, mistaking it for the sober effects of his own reason, when it is the air blown bubble that he hears from a thousand lips—when it is the overpowering impulse of his mind, heated by popular sway and opinion, preventing a cool and correct direction of the understanding; slight though its foundation, a breath, a feather its cause, still will its purpose be the same, and its reign hold pace with life itself, mixing with its minutest circumstance, directing its duties and its actions; and though on its face a gross absurdity, equally vile, terrible, and detestable to other prevailing opinions, contrary to right itself, yet guided by it, blinded to the truth, man rushes headlong on, doing deeds unhallowed, crimes that were it not for the applauding voice of the inconsistent world would make him shudder at himself. To-day it assumes in its terrific career the garb of religious zeal; then to-morrow it is pretended principle, and again committing every violence under the name boldly owned of party, finding admirers, defenders, and followers for every step it takes, making the laws themselves subservient to sinister views, however adverse to common sense, to virtue, and morality; and yet so fickle are the feelings that arise from the promptings of prejudice, that that which at one time is iniquity, at another is honesty itself, and the same voice that elevates deception, cries it down from the station to which it had lifted it; for it is the weakness of nature to long after continual novelty, and deceit and falsehood being the most admired by imagination, most times rule our fancy, which ever thirsting for variety is the more prone to credulity, and for the moment is inflamed in proportion to the force and operation of the first cause which it receives; but the animosity of the passion thus addressed being satiated, it is the more avaricious of fresh gratification, and is ready to be controlled by any dominion so it be new, and false to that which governed last. What safety, then, exists to life or property, when at the mercy of men liable to be sported with by this predominant power—equally to be played on like the sands by the sea breeze—who are more times piloted in their passage of existence by passion than truth? in sooth it is a mockery, a solemn masquerade that maketh a derision of justice—that places in the hands of a dozen men, possibly all ignorant or obstinate, the dearest privileges, the most sacred rights, and the most hallowed principles of social connexion. How feeble the chance of right, (though sometimes blundered on) even if pure and honest, is to be derived from the minds of a motley and indiscriminately chosen jury—set to decide the most intricate subject— affairs of national and mercantile importance depending on the uninformed fiat of unlettered and unwashed artizans and tradesmen, to whom the customs, and the law which is to direct them, are as inexplicable as the labyrinth of Crete; and then, too, the dangers that beset them in their own selfishness—the dread of privation in some, the uninterested feeling of others, whose whole thoughts are centered in their own absent affairs, and are ready to sacrifice any thing—conscience, their own sense of rectitude, to escape from the subject to which their attention is demanded; then the weak dependence on the will of others, the composition of their opinion to the majority; and last, the obstinate ignorance, unconvinced by fact or reason, of some dogmatical logician, whose only cause for adherence to the course he takes, is the pride of bringing others, by dint of stubbornness, to side with him in ideas which though preposterous, having first started, he conceives it incumbent on him to maintain:—all these render perilous the course of justice, and are as quicksands, through which it is indeed fortunate if it escape wreck or injury in its passage; while to the dullest vision, the hollowness of the whole solemn parade of law is apparent—and to its enactors may justly be applied, what the ancient sage said of the priests of Rome, `that he was surprised, that they who were so well acquainted with the farce and holy juggles of their religion, could see one another without laughing.' But albeit, to return to the matter that hath been digressed from; the tenor of action planned for the court, before which Leisler was now about to appear, the rather for form than for the least opportunity of vindication of conduct, was such as well became the dark intentions of his enemies and the more befitted the tyrannic tribunal of an arbitrary and military despot—a Roman prætor of a conquered province, than one convened in pursuance of the strict and equitable law of the province; and bound in its bearing and decision, by long established and matured authorities, which had been exercised in similar cases, without regard to private feelings, either for or against the delinquent. It is true, that owing to the disordered and convulsed situation of public affairs during the latter part of the rule of Leisler himself, that cases of emergency, that had a bearing on the welfare of the state as it then stood, such as treasonable attempts to overthrow the then established authority, by a law, or rather a necessary edict, passed for its own safety by the partizan council of the day, were taken under a hasty and immediate cognizance, and the power of deciding for life or death was assumed against the criminal, as in the case of Bayard and Nichols, detailed in one of the former sections of this narration; the height of party spirit, and unceasing exertion of their opponents, rendering an undue severity on the part of the Leslerian faction towards their invidious foes, oftentimes, if not wholly excusable, at least, greatly to be extenuated. Yet now, the case was materially changed in its aspect—owing to the Bayard party being countenanced by the new govenor, and thereby apparently upheld by the shadow of the sovereign in its course, together with the fatal and stunning blow, stricken so suddenly to the very roots of the late opposing faction, for the present, at least, there could not be the same causes, for fear that had visited the power of Leisler, or the smallest murmur of discontent towards them—so much in awe did all stand, on that which seemed to bear the royal sanction, even though through a satellite; and besides, that a greater odium might fall upon the government which they had so strenuously stood out against, and that it might appear unfavourable abroad, and their procedures the more warranted, they already had eagerly set out to investigate, and cry down as violent, rebellious, and illegal, its every act, declaring not only the laws passed during the period of their power, as contrary to polity, adverse to the statutes of the mother country, but null and void as the acts and deeds of rebellious traitors—who, for pursuing a path under them, were deserving of the scaffold; and with an eagerness only to be accounted for by the rabid and ravenous hunger, to destroy all that could remind them that they had ever been held under the sway of a man so detested by them as Leisler, or fearful that something might be drawn from them, lessening the charges that they were making to the world against him, and bring on themselves an accusation of over hastiness, and perhaps malice, no sooner could they obtain possession of the public records of the province, (and in the performance of their wishes, they were, as may be supposed, assiduously assisted by the zeal of Dirk Van Rikketie, to whom great advantage therefor was given, by his incorruptibility and the station he held,) than with a bold hand they obliterated from the colonial archives nearly every thing that related to the transaction of the time, which did not accord with their own story of the Revolution which had brought forward the name and influence of Leisler; and indeed, the minutes of the provincial history (such was the determined hatred of their destruction of all documents relating thereto) may in vain be searched as to aught that truly relates to the time—a vacuum, a silence, dark as the hearts of his foes alone remains, which even the after fortune of his partizans, the justice done his family when he lay rotten in the grave by the undeceived sovereign, has not been able to fill; indeed the memory that hath followed the fate of this unfortunate man hath been an unjust one, and is an example of to what extent power and prejudice can be carried, in its influence deforming the fair page of the historian, even for ages after the truth hath transpired, for though a weak, and mayhap a misguided man, Jacobus Leisler was neither the bad nor the vile one he hath been painted; in truth he was one against whom the voice of the world hath been louder than his career deserved, and the might of his enemies hath been such as to overshadow all the good branches, leaving the bared plant of evil to flourish to after times, making true the sublime sentiment of the Indian orator, `that it is a truth, and a melancholy truth, that the good things which men do are often buried in the ground, while their evil deeds are stripped naked and exposed to the world;' and yet we are told of the veracity of this or that chronicler, whose solitary judgment is to be relied on in the tradition he pens, as bearing the index of the hearts of those departed to the tomb, and whose vain conceit lays down the secret sources, the hidden intention, and the undivulged feelings that prompted the deed whose effect they alone are able to relate; making this man, as their fancy chooses, a Nero, and that a Camillus; sooth, it is all a fiction, hollow and worthless— can others judge our hearts? where is the man living, or that can ever exist, who can read that which may outwardly appear plain? Dare he presume to tell from what thought, what fancy, or instinctive spring it hath arisen? If so, he must be endued with more than men from whom I have drawn my knowledge of the species; yea, far more than half the bold historian hath chosen to write, is but a tissue of invented falsehood, baseless and unfounded; and could the grave be opened, and the harmless dust that fills them speak as at confessional, there would be a strange change upon the pages whose substance hath been so greedily swallowed; the good man would many times be the bad, and the vile might attain respect, such as now we dream not on; for so singular is the course of life, that often that which is excellence, when it should command admiration, is clouded, like the moon in a stormy night, in the world's eye, by envious calumny, unfortunate mischance, suffering, or vile persecution; but as to the proceedings which were taken against Leisler, nathless, the somewhat like during his power, the Vol. II. 22 friends of Bayard, supported their conduct by citing in defence of the mockery, the laws of England during the preceding reigns, and the arbitrary course of the Star Chamber; not regarding, (for revenge and hate will always find arguments to support the most infamous precedents—and for the most horrible and monstrous crimes there is no dearth of the last,) that among the very complaints against the house of Stuart, and among the very main springs of the revolution, which they pretended so much to glory in, as from it the present government of England had arisen, had been the very acts which they called forth in their justification; for they had by their cruelty and injustice aroused an oppressed nation to snap asunder their chains of thraldom. And as to the success of the Bayard party in their black design of a heavy sentence on their prisoner, there was apparently no obstacle, although in the principal judge of the Oyer and Terminer, (Sir Thomas Robinson, a man though of dull intellect and but little native brightness of character, yet of intentional uprightness,) they found one whose feelings did not assimilate to the savage thirst of persecution they desired; and indeed he was the means of impeding slightly the course proceeded against the victim, as will shortly be seen, by his doubts on the evidence of the crimes for which Leisler was arraigned; he was a short, harsh, cold and austere featured man, with dark eyes and thick brows, deep, black, and frowning countenance, the forbidding aspect of which was heightened by a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the mouth, which appeared always knit and wrinkled, and bespoke a selfish though determinate character. About him thronged the gloomy visages of the others, who were joined with him in his office, their features pallid and gloomy in the shadows of the lantern; and as the busy hum of their whispering voices arose as they eagerly strove to attain of each other their secret sentiments and bent of mind toward the prisoner, whose presence was momently expected, the thought easily pictured them as conspirators assembled in some lonesome cavern, planning their murderous path of crime. As the rushing of a hurried and mingled tread without broke on the murmured converse of the court, and a loud and hollow knock upon the door betokened the expected coming of the prisoner, a deep and intense stillness pervaded the apartment; by the sound every tongue was chained to instant silence;—something like a fearful expectancy seemed imprinted on the anxious countenances of the persons present, and for a moment, each appeared to hold his breath at the vibration; for the while, at the noise the eager communication that had been passing was stilled, as though the speaker's words had been chilled upon the warm lip of utterance. Some there were who turned pale and felt ill at ease, to look upon their victim's face, as a momentary remorse smote at the dark resolution of their hearts; others startled as until then they had not been aware of the stern certainty of that which they were doomed to take a part in; but there were those, who with fierce and steady glance, turned their cold and unfeeling eyes towards the unclosing door of the apartment, and set their unmoved and forbidden visages in that fixed cast that tempered and bespoke the character of their intentions. Clad in his soiled and prison array, his spirits that had arisen in the semblance of relief from sufferance and thraldom, afforded in the passage from the dungeon to the court—sunken and exhausted almost in the convincement of a moment, like the sudden flash of a lamp stricken in a charnel-house, and which dies as soon as lighted, smothered by dank and poisonous vapours from the rottenness of the surrounding dead,—Jacob Leisler advanced before the tribunal of his judges; as he walked, his pace was apparently slow and waning, the rather from faintness than age, if the wan lustre of his sunken eye, and his pallid and fallen cheek were read aright;—and as though scarce able to support his own frame, he leaned its trembling weight upon his son; and as he clung, drooping and careworn, to the stripling's patient arm, he resembled some tottering ruin of an ancient column, upheld alone from falling by the protecting tendril, whose roots found succour at its mouldering base—the parent and the child—the goodly oak bent by the blasting storm of winter, till it sunk upon the outstretched branches of its own shoot and scion. It were a tedious, useless and unnecessary course to pursue, to set forth at length the many passages, the minute and tiresome proceedings of this mockery of a trial,—this false examination of the acts of Leisler; sooth, it will be sufficient to state, that no form that might strictly be considered legal was wanting; in that the farce was played unto its uttermost. There was in this investigation all the treachery of outward right to the accused, but encountered by judicial subtleties; Leisler was, with an apparent anxiety for fairness, forewarned of that which was his service and privilege as an English subject, only to be silenced when he applied the arguments pointed out to him, by the court's deeming them inapplicable when used: nor was there, as may be supposed, a lack of prepared testimony from the corrupt lips of suborned or prejudiced witnesses, in whose partial relation the simplest action and the purest intentions were turned to manifest guiltiness. For, to some men the sacred obligation of an oath, no matter how it affects the life or fortune of a fellow, is but the bending of a straw, —the passing of breath, leaving no feeling unless that of exultation at the triumph it achieved, in the vile breast from which it took its being; albeit, with most the solemn action of a vow, the bond of truth hath not the slightest force or control; sooth, he that hath no veracity withouten these, nothing human or divine can bind: yet such is nature, that there are but few when their interest is at stake, or when guided by ill will or revenge, who will not almost unknown to themselves, or at least without premeditated guidance, stretch their evidence to leave an unfavourable impression against the object of those bitter feelings, arguing even at the time, that they have spoken uprightly and given that which was the fact, scarce reflecting that the words of good were weak and evanescent to the detail of evil; and then, too often man allows himself to be borne away, like the forest bark on a mountain current, without either care, power, or will to stay his impetuous way, by sudden impulse arisen from the circumstance of the moment. An instant conceived dislike, or startling envy, a hatred, to trace whose cause were vain, have each their predominance, against which there is no contention: the propensity of spiteful retribution to retaliate ancient injuries, when the opportunity offers, is greedily snatched at; and man is wont at such hours to be ravenous, and lacerate as the lion tears the lamb, his defenceless prey. The principle too is inherent in the human formation, and animates at once the high and the low to pull down all that they conceive soar above them, either by good fortune or capacity; and there is nought more than this that will stimulate the most inveterate falsehood; for by railing at worth and depreciating it with filthy lies, if not oftentimes its success is marred, it at least eases of gall, with the idea, the overflowing hearts of its enemies. Every circumstance, therefore, that his direst foemen desired, was set forth in its most vivid colourings against the hapless prisoner; and if by chance, unmeant, aught in his favour escaped, it was hastily glossed over until his case resembled some dark and high wrought portrait of death—of whose terrors so deep and lasting were the horrors that struck the eye—that to them the whole attention was embound and entranced, so that scarce a glance could be drawn to any redeeming quality or relieving pleasure that the conynge hand of the artist had drawn to the groupings on his living canvass.—And it was easy to determine as this midnight tribunal drew fast to the closing of the protracted sitting which engaged it, by the cold and icy looks, and frowning and relentless visages that peered upon the desolate and fallen, though once proud and haughty burgomaster of Niew Amsterdam—that the majority of his judges were impatient to give the last seal to his miserable fortune, and that if any latent hope stirred within him (for that deserts but with life,) it were vain to indulge its faithless whisperings—the harsh set features around him looked not of mercy or even compassion: but it was not so with Leisler—well knew he those whom he dealt with then, and he sought not idly favours of men who were directed to spurn at him, and to 22* whom it would have given glee to have had the chance to refuse his beseeching.—The old man sat at the bar firm and unmoved, scarce showing by smile or word the scorn he felt for the taunts of his adversaries, which were allowed by the Court to be showered on him; he attempted no defence, he sought not to deprecate the wrath that burst around his head—for he was taught it were useless as shouting to the embattled elements: apparently a change had come on the man in the trials he was now subject to, which in his former life had been wanting—there was indeed a natural constitutional obstinacy, the heirloom of his dutch descent, which he possessed and which in the hour of success in council he had exercised with all the infatuation of ignorance to his own injury, but this very defect seemed metamorphosed into a virtue, an undaunted firmness of bearing like the mighty hemlock the wings of the tempest unbending—but once, and that was at the first, when demanded to answer to the truth of the charges preferred against his life, he spoke as to the cruelty of urging on a trial against him unwarned, unnoticed, and unprepared—of hurrying him from his dungeon as it were to instant condemnation, without even the chance given to the most infamous criminal for defence, of reflection, of summoning such whose testimony might be of service in contradiction of that which was false in the accusations, and of consultation with his friends who might advise on points which to him were unknown, or unthought of—and then Leisler finding these attempts for time availed not—for with the most plausible and sophistical words his judges combatted and overwhelmed all that he had offered—he strove to justify his conduct in seizing the government of the province, by insisting that Lord Nottingham's letter entitled him to act in the quality of Lieutenant Governor, and plead for himself and adherents (many of whom he understood his own trial was but the prelude to proceedings against) their zeal and service for King William—but when he found all he had advanced was unattended with any impression, and that those to whom he spoke listened weary and impatient, he sank in silence resigned and expectant of the worst that could be invented for his destruction; deeming it but waste of word and time to oppose the progress of concerted action; not so his son—with flushed cheek, and quick and flashing eye Arnyte heard the garbled tale of treachery woven to existence from the mouths of men, many of whom had been the sycophantic spaniels who had humbly licked the foot-prints of his father but a day or so gone by, and these without to him apparent cause for such base ingratitude, were most active and inveterate as though they desired to suck the blood of their late patron, eager and contending for the first mouthful, like wild dogs over the corse on a battle plain; he scarce wotted that those who fawn the most, or who swear the loudest of return for received gifts are the most hollow and faithless, and are soon ready, if themselves are vantaged thereby, to change the tenor of their sounding oaths, careless, an it serve their interest, if it destroy him whose hand had raised them. The youth's heart beat quick, and his lips trembled as he saw the barefaced slanders received as reality; his choler rose within him, nor could he control the indignation that swelled his panting breast, and like the rabid serpent of the east, leaping from the branch where it had coiled itself in watch upon its incautious prey, his quick and angered feelings burst forth at times driving in their violence the appalled wretch against whom his speech was directed to fearful silence; the power of the Judges, the threats of the Court, could scarce keep bounds upon his irritated temper. “Great God! do I stand among men who pretend to civilization?” cried the impetuous stripling, starting at last astonished from his seat, his feelings inflamed to the uttermost by an unblushing and unrelenting pursuance in the Court of its arbitrary and unjust course of proceeding towards the prisoner, the crisis of whose predetermined condemnation was now evidently fast approaching: “Great God! do I stand among men who pretend to civilization?” exclaimed he with passionate warmth, and with a voice whose sound kindled in strength to later manhood: “or is this an assemblage of heathen salvages, the infidels of the wilderness, wearing the human form, yet lacking its virtues,—holding the life of a creature but as the wild hart they slay for sport? can it be, that here among christian men, words and the relation of deeds, to which the safety of a human being is enchained are played with at will, and that grave jurists, experienced in mankind and the laws can drink in palpable falsities, contrary to their own knowledge,—adverse to reason, with all the thirstiness of the foul kite sucking the gore of its slain victim? Is there no power, no justice in the land to whom appeal can come; but shall the innocent perish by the tainted breath of such whose very touch is as the leper, making poisonous and rotten the wholesome air in which they move? Can this be intended, or is it but some grave pastime at which ye are amused withal, that on, the which hath been set out against Jacob Leisler ye mean to proceed to judgment, an so—these ye have construed are fine customs, rare edicts, that read so well for the accused yet act against him.” “You are presumptuous, young man, thus unwarranted to invade, with rude license of speech, the deliberation of this tribunal;” quoth Sir Thomas Robinson, sternly, “your hastiness, young Sir, tendeth not in advantage to the accused, to whom lenity is shown that you are not now taken from his side—albeit, his apparent weakness of health seeketh thy arms' support:—my froward master, this Court knoweth what is proper in its procedures withouten your sage invective or angry strictures—I pray ye an ye look to the consequence of your words, keep silence! we seek not to exercise the powers vested in us to your harm, though ye have braved them more than once; therefore bide ye still.” After he thus reprehended the youth, the judge turned to his associates and continued: “having now, Sirs, the full evidence of this matter of accusation against Jacob Leisler before you, I call on you brothers of this Court for your sentiments thereon, as to the guilt or innocence of this man, and whether if you agree as to the crime, there hath been enough produced for us to found the punishment usual to the offence of treason—death! How say ye, Sirs?” “I pray ye, my learned masters, to bear with me but a moment,” again interrupted Arnyte, greatly alarmed, and blanched with terror at the words of the judge, at the same time struck with the truth conveyed in the rebuke he had received, and becoming aware instantly that his incautious and unadvised bearing was truly more calculated to increase the imminent danger of him for whose safety his heart yearned than to aid him: “I pray ye to bear with me, Sirs, and pardon the rashness that hath given vent thus to my fault, and hear me ere you proceed to pronounce on the offences that have been charged against Jacob Leisler—hear me, grave Sirs, I pray ye,” he continued, “for I am a child, pleading for his parent, and by that holy tie of kindred, than which on earth there lives none stronger, an ye have one touch of nature in ye, ye will listen with patience to that which I urge, and though mayhap aught presumptuous escape me, be not prejudiced against him for whom I speak, or offended thereat, but set it down to the unguarded warmth of my green youth, sore touched at heart by the miseries of my family; set it down, I pray ye, Sirs, to the anxiety that moves me for the life and welfare of him from whose loins I have sprang—who from the seed to the shoot hath succoured, tended, and protected me, and to whom, next to God, I am indebted for being. I do not mean, neither will I, sirs, speak any thing to injure those who have taken the pains to make so foul that beloved friend; neither will I urge on you that he hath been a good and faithful servant of our lord the king— though that and even more might I insist on. Neither will I ask of you the law or the statute that teacheth what is and what is not treason, for it would be unwise in one so wanting in years like me, to demand of you, old and sage as you are, where is the mark, the token upon the crime which ye have placed up against Jacob Leisler. In troth, from want of knowledge, briefness of days, experience, and above all the trembling of this heart, which like a frightened bird beating in alarm at its wiry prison, throbs against my side with quick and rapid motion of fear, I am unmeet at time like this to be my father's advocate; yet of this great principle, which from the cradle we are taught, it is mine to remind you on—be wary how from the image of your Creator you take away life; for that of which you rob it you can never make restoration: remember sirs, I beseech of you, in this trying time, the wide difference between accusers, prosecutors, and judges. How misbecoming in the latter character is that heat of temper, desire and fervour for triumph, which are so praiseworthy and commendable in the conduct of the two former situations. It is good, it is honest, yea most noble, to work hand and heart to discover iniquity, to drag the truth to light; but when that great end is accomplished, every passion that warmed inquiry should be dismissed, and those to whom the judgment thereupon is given ought to be calm, unstirred and cautious—for in this the fiat ye are deeply responsible; better every hair of your heads were twined by the grave worms, than that your judgment should be biassed— that ye should sport the blood of a fellow being to satiate hate, prejudice, or revenge—for to God Almighty have ye to reckon for its rectitude or obliquity; nor can ye say when called, like Cain of the olden day, ye are not your brother's keeper; for like then blood will smoke from the earth against ye, and ye will be forced to give a strict account for every drop to whose shedding ye have been the remotest accessors: for the judge is God's own steward, and if in the scale of justice he cast a grain of sand, bitter shall he rue it. If this be not hearkened to, (but there is a mark on the door of my house like the plague were within, forbidding all to enter,—but to shun the death cry of its chambers,) if the doom is set, oh bethink of what will be said hereafter! let not the curses of posterity light on your memory; let not men as they cross your graves spurn the sod that covers your relics, repeating as a stigma which will descend from generation to generation, like a disease of the blood, that ye were injust judges or corrupted men. No! the rather now let every man of this court lay his hand upon his heart, and seriously consider that which he is a-going to do with a single breath, yea, with the breath of his nostrils, the gift of his maker, he is about to do justice, or (start not, for it is so) he is about to commit murder. Nay, frown not, sirs, but hear me out, I will not trespass long; ye have the choice —justice on one side, and rank murder on the other, with all its heightened and aggravated features; for he that, led by thirst of plunder madly takes the life of the traveller, is light of crime, to the cool and deliberate judge that giveth knowingly a wrongful sentence:—the first doubtless commits a mighty sin, but the last is impious in his crime, for he applies the ordinance of God to suit his bloody purpose. Sooth sirs, I pray ye purge your hearts from all evil passions in this business, and ere ye utter forth your opinions cleanse your minds of every foul affection, even as ye would the glassy surface of your eyes when shaping to the discernment some distant and doubtful form, from every mote which the wind casts on the tender vision to impede its subtleness: take heed, I seek of ye that your intentions be not pretincted by blight, shade, or colour—beware, I charge on ye that ye look not with a blood-shotten eye on that which ye are to make up judgment on; remember that ye are but men, weak and liable to err, and that he whom ye are to pronounce on is your fellow, against whom there should be with you no corruptive of justice—no personal animosity should with a righteous man weigh a grain in the scale; no greedy desire of popularity—no thirst of flatteries to the multitude, should animate the bosom of any one of ye— banish from the places where you set to decide on life or death, all principle of selfish fear, that by sparing blood ye will incense those to whom the accused is odious —let it not be an ingredient in your sentence that by mildness to him ye endanger yourselves—fear not that while Jacob Leisler breathes the life of any one of ye is not in safety, so that ye hasten his death by so fell a thought; yea sirs, I do beseech of ye to discharge your duty before God, so that ye may look on your work with a clear conscience—for on the effect of this solemn protestation depends not alone the life, fame, and fortune of my beloved father who stands before you, but the existence of one whom you must allow most innocent; I have another parent to whom the tidings of your sentence brings joy or wo unutterable, and—pardon, my learned masters, these rebel tears that wet my cheeks—of that which I may suffer myself I will not trouble you. I had a word more to say, but am choaked with sorrow—I have not strength further to speak—sirs, I have done, bidding ye again, ere I close my lips, to wash your hands and your souls of innocent blood.” As Arnyte commenced this appeal to the uprightness of the court, his manner was fearful and timorous, his actions hurried and agitated, and his utterance faint, low, and broken, and the gasping and somewhat convulsive efforts with which he endeavoured to gain composure, were plainly perceptible, with the husky tones of his voice and the tremor of his limbs; but as he proceeded onward his confidence apparently increased—and though ever and anon between the pauses of his speech his lips trembled and his outstretched hand shook violently, as the young branches of a tree disturbed by the autumnal wind, yet his colour heightened and his eye blazed with a steadier light, and the sound of his words was full and strong, and flowed boldly forth, like the mighty current of some noble stream; and there was a solemn bearing in his mien, that for the time was felt by the most ironhearted of the judges; for as he stood with foot advanced and head thrown back, and every limb and feature swelling with the feeling that stirred him, he looked like one inspired beyond his years, a forewarning messenger calling on men about committing ill, to pause upon their wickedness:—nor did his courage fail him until he drew nigh to the close of that which he had spoken, then his own words disturbed him with the horrid pictures that followed them abruptly in his sensitive imagination; and as he continued, his cheek grew paler and paler, and every muscle was moved, and in spite of his attempts to restrain them, big and beaded drops coursed each other down his face, until overcome as it were for the moment, he paused ere he pursued his discourse, to recruit his waning powers in one strong effort, which he breathed forth in the last sentence to which he commended the attention of his father's judges. When Arnyte had finished speaking there succeeded an interval, during which there was scarce perceptible voice, stir, or motion throughout that apartment—it was an awful pause of conviction for the minute, mingled with a breathless anticipation of that which might thereafter chance. Some, who at the first words of the youth had drawn up their lips with ireful scorn, and prepared to listen to that which he should offer with cold and hasty indifference, but of which little remained long ere they heard him through, now sat motionless, with eye and attention rivetted on the youthful suppliant, as though bound by the magic spell of an enchanter, melted down from the iron confidence of their intended determination, —stricken, wavering and irresolute, with minds startled and amazed to wonderment, devouring, as it were with greediness, the warm and thrilling memory of the stripling's deprecation, as though it had been a sweet and touching sound of mistrelsy and song, that had so wrought on the tender chords of the heart, that though the melody itself had departed and died in the distance, it seemed as if perception yet lingered and reigned upon the spirit; but this endured not;—the slight affection of the moment passed away like summer rain drops on a bleak and barren rock, leaving behind neither warmth nor kindliness: for, bursting the thrall that for the time enchained the thoughts of the judges, there uprose the worst enemy Leisler had in the court, and with a malicious, yet cunning tongue, he hastened to goad the serpent hate to ire from the sleep in which it had been lulled; he laboured to recall to the recollection of those around him, with vivid and skilful description, yet concealing outwardly every sinister motive for his sentiments,—all that was condemned, detested and envied in the accused as the grounds of the opinion which he gave, at the same time expressing in indignant terms of resentment his apprehension of the presumptuous boldness, the “endurance of which,” as he said, “was a matter of surprise, by a court conscious of its own dignity, of that insolent and unabashed boy who had dared dictate to the learned and chosen of the land, and insult them with suggestions unfavourable to their uprightness Vol. II. 23 and honesty as men and as judges;—“for to what else,” pursued the speaker, “aims his discourse, but that he hath doubts of the impartiality, firmness and virtue of this tribunal? yea,” continued he, “this malapert stripling beseeches neither from us mercy or compassion, but hath addressed this court as though it were composed of malefactors, men ready,—ay, even now baring the murtherous knife to the throat of the passive and inoffensive victim; forsooth, why passeth he so glaring an insult on wise and prudent judges, unswayed by aught that can interfere with their sworn duty, an it be not that he hopes by this imprudent strain to make us appear venal and corrupt partisans, using the name and shadow of our offices to suit our personal enmity?—to this point palpably he alone hath laboured, thinking since so lightly he hath touched on the crimes of the accused, that by stamping the court with sin he covers the prisoner's guilt; and this disrespect is the less excusable in the wilful chatterling, seeing that he lacketh not sense, but hath the ability and knowledge to act a better part—but nathless, withal Sirs he is young—young, a mere child, heedless and unthinking mayhap of the full construction of that which he hath ventured forth—I pray ye sirs to pardon him therefore, and attribute his rashness to his immaturity, and want of experience—besides the boy hath been warmed naturally—for it is his parent's cause which hath awakened his words—it is not therefore worth time to dwell upon the matter longer:—but I will proceed to state that as the proof appears to me, it is evident the measures pursued by Jacobus Leisler during the latter part at least of his power, together with his dissolving the late Convention, and imprisoning divers reputable persons inhabitants of the province, and subjects of the kingdom of England are tumultuous, illegal, and against their majesties' right, and greatly do I fear that the late heart-rending and appalling tragedy—the slaughter and fire at Schenectadie by the salvages, are mainly to be attributed to his unlawful and injudicious osurpation of all power, for which he hath had no authority save the promptings of vile and inordinate ambition, and moreover I do protest against the forcible seizure and confiscation of the effects of sundry persons, and against the unauthorized levying of money on their majesties' liege subjects in the manner the same hath been done by this man, and I do not hesitate to say that his holding the fort against his Excellency Colonel Sloughter, the governor, is an open and intended act of rebellion for which alone the severest punishment that can be inflicted he deserves to suffer: viewing things in this light, however painful it may be to me as a man situated as I am —a neighbour for years, an acquaintance of the accused— yet before God my duty as a citizen and a judge must be performed, and which I trust to the latest period of my existence I shall discharge with a pure conscience, and that my judgment in this affair shall be consonant to the best of my understanding in all integrity; I must say, that I do consider that the life of a traitor is but poor atonement for his offence, which is heinous—being against his sovereign, his benefactor, and his country; and as this case stands I solemnly protest I acquit myself honestly thereby in asserting that on candid and cool deliberation I declare for the death of the criminal.” The determination of the generality of mankind hath its source not from reason or positive conviction of right, but rather from prepossession, from desire which oftentimes (as in the case of the judges of Leisler,) is formed before hearing a just and fair representation of the matter to be deliberated on—if the wish of the heart be for acquittal or condemnation, where is the mind of man (though elevated on the judgment seat, which weak and presuming creatures of mortality have raised, a mockery of their Creator, where folly and obduracy, infamy and corruption are enthroned to pronounce the vain edicts of social order, as it is called, the technical trickeries that men term law and justice:) that can resist the predominant bias—a doubt, a hesitation, it is admitted of the soundness of such inclination by truth and plausible argument may be raised for the time, if the intention of the hearer be honest—yet the hold of this is feeble and soon banished if the predetermination can be borne out by sentiments that appear reasonable on the surface, though the face be hollow as a mask, yet the partial feeling will succour its unworthiness until it seemeth reality to the ready sight —indeed the appetite is ravenous, and earnestly and anxiously searches out support for the inclination which taketh pains to banish all that interferes with its bent.— Albeit from such cause fled the late awakened compassion towards the prisoner from the breast of the Court, and an eager accordance was rendered by the judges to the opinion and words last expressed by their comate; one alone of the tribunal seemed to pause as if scarce satisfied that the course now strenuously urged, by the others associated in his power, to be pursued—as if the dire and fatal judgment which would devolve on him to give unto the accused as principal of the Court, was adverse to his sense of right:—in truth the mind of Sir Thomas Robinson was like one of those cold, sluggish and icy streams which no wind can stir, nor agitates more than a ruffle of its waves, which heavily subside in motion almost as soon as roused—neither vindictive nor compassionate even in this time of popular excitement, it mattered little to his private feelings whether clearance or punishment awaited the accused—laggard in idea, he neither snatched like his fellows at the arguments proposed against the prisoner nor sought he out any matter in favour—but like most men of his formation of intellect at once obstinate and dispassionate, he had seized on a thought which had been offered in the course of the examination as a ground of opinion, and on that he had based himself, and he was neither therefrom to be moved by aught either fair in reason or otherwise, for his was a nature that prided itself in being unbending and unwavering in its integrity. “Sirs of this court,” quoth he, “with patience I have listened to that which ye have presented as your different opinions in this business; and it is a matter wherein I trust I am in nowise misled by a wrongful judgment, seeing that in all we agree not; for that I am not able to side in full with you—I will give you therefor my inducements, informing first that assuredly the acts as charged and made out against Jacob Leisler, are of themselves, excluding every collateral matter, criminal and rebellious —and in the next, as they stand, the sentence which the most of this court have decided on, is just; all this I grant. Nathless ye will remember, sirs, the prisoner hath asseverated in behalf of his own innocence, the which in my mind I am unable to do away, that in the exercise of his gubernatorial sway of this province and its dependencies, he was authorized by a certain letter from the lords Caermarthen and Halifax, directed to `Francis Nicholson, Esq., or in his absence to such as for the time being take care for preserving the peace and administering the laws in their majesties' province of New-Yorke, in America;' which letter is dated the twenty-ninth of July, 1689, accompanying that of Lord Nottingham to Nicholson, dated the next day, empowering him, Nicholson, to take upon himself the chief command (Colonel Dongan, our late governor, having sailed for London on his recall,) and to appoint for his assistance as many of the freeholders and inhabitants of the province as he should see fit, requiring also to do every thing appertaining to the office of Lieutenant Governor, according to the laws and customs of New-Yorke, until further orders. Now sirs, though it may be urged that these could not apply to the prisoner, he having seized on the government by force, and driven Nicholson, the person first addressed in the documents alluded to from the country—he, Leisler, albeit it must be confessed was then the person who for the time being held the reins of the government, and this is the letter of the address on the packet; now this fact may not be a strict inference, the accused being not regularly or lawfully chosen to the place he then filled; yet the success of the Protestant cause in some measure excuses the means of his elevation, and putteth an equity about his defence; on this head, to avoid and prevent what may be a rash decision otherwise, I declare myself in doubt, and ask your minds more freely and full thereon; for let us not wantonly, or rather ignorantly, dip our hands in blood; let us not be lost in any licentiousness of feeling against the prisoner, but seek alone to administer justice. And therein I promise myself, if enlightened 23* of that which I have thrown out, to forget all except my duty in the vindictiveness of the law against the guilty: but at present to accord with you under my hesitation, would be like driving a dagger in a healing wound, the which I cannot think on without trembling. Sirs, let the judgment we determine be like my Lord Bacon said of the laws of Henry IV., “not made upon the spur of particular occasion for the present, but out of providence for the future.” Sir Thomas Robinson having thus freely delivered the feelings that weighed on his mind, a long discussion ensued among the members of the court relative thereto; in the course of which the unrelenting adversaries of the prisoner growing warm and irritable from the hindrance likely to arise to their views of an early determination of Leisler's career, in the doubts expressed as to the guilt of their victim by the principal judge, ardently and obstreporously exerted themselves, at times almost to anger when unsuccessful, to convince him of the hollowness of that which he had advanced, or rather to overwhelm his hesitation to accede to that which they so earnestly desired, with a torrent of sophistry and of sounding words; but like most arguments with persons at once obstinate and opinionative, this was unfruitful of success; from the very heat in which the opposition was urged, Sir Thomas gathered new strength for the ground he assumed, and the greater the endeavours the less he was convinced. There are of that kind, who though the stand in disputation they have chosen be utterly untenable, and adverse to reason itself, yet out of pure stubbornness of nature, or from a spirit disliking to be subdued and acknowledge error, will not yield, even though o'erborne by numbers and by truth; but will carp and hang on trifles and inaccuracies picked from the discourses of those with whom they are contending; like the shipwrecked mariner, who while in vain he hath strove to seize the sides of the slippery crag itself to draw him from the deep, whose hungry and devouring waves are roaring round him, in the madness of despair in a last effort, snatches with wild hopes of success at the sea plant, and the moss that grows upon its slimy surface, as if there was support for life in things so tender, frail, and feeble, and which tear and break at a touch. Of a species allied to the one last described was Sir Thomas Robinson; nathless in the present position he had much of sense to bear him out; nor was the harsh and eager manner with which the others laboured to enforce their wishes, favourable with him to the attainment: indeed so far did it lose effect as to make those ideas which at first were wavering and indefinite, apparently mere creatures of the moment, thoughts bound to conscience—like seated rocks that dive with deep embedded roots in the dark earth, fearless and unshaken by hurricane or tempest rain—and besides adverse to the desire of the Bayard faction, there were those whom the obstinacy and firmness of Sir Thomas worked on, among such as had already declared in favour of the course that had been proposed against Leisler's life—for there are many who will assent to the most preposterous or monstrous matter started to them, finding it undisputed, either incited by a carelessness of disposition, unapt to reflection, or from a timidness of temperament to be alone a dissenter from what is agreed on by every body else, who, when there starts out one bold enough to attack the doctrine, will either waver from or openly desert the side which they had at the commencement blindly or unthinkingly enlisted on. The anti Leslerians soon perceiving that several of their partizans were growing cold in the cause, and apparently were desirous of moderate measures towards the accused, while others, pricked by remorse, were unsettled and wandering from that which heretofore had been fixed in their resolution, became fearful lest by some untoward circumstance their prey might yet escape them; and being induced by this thought, the leaders having, among themselves, unperceived by the rest of the Court, interchanged a brief and sudden counsel, insidiously, and to appearance, reluctantly, to gain their ends, accorded with the doubts which Sir Thomas had honestly expressed, and appeared thoroughly convinced, having changed for the mo ment their intended career, that there was an intricate question arising on the point that had been started, which they were unable to give a fair decision on; and after flattering the discrimination of Sir Thomas, they prompted fresh difficulties, until he himself and his party wearied and unable to decide in any way, of their own accord proposed what, however, had first been cunningly suggested by the foes of Leisler, that the part of the prisoner's defence from which their controversy had taken its source, should be referred to the governor and council, praying their opinion whether the letter of the lords Caermarthen and Halifax, “or any other letters or papers, in the packet from Whitehall could be understood or interpreted to be or contain any power or direction to Captain Leisler, to take the government of the province upon himself, or that the administration thereupon be holden good in law;”[24] [24] Smith's History of New-York, page 99. and it was settled, that in case the reference was answered in the negative, that Leisler was guilty of the crime of high treason and should be condemned to expiate that offence upon the scaffold. In this artifice, the enemies of the accused obtained their triumph completely, for they were well aware of their success in the question, for the bitterest foemen of Leisler were now alone to speak, and it requires but little foresight to believe that where malice and inveterate hate were to determine a less questionable reliance, than on which hung the life of the accused would be o'erborne; nathless, at the same time they whispered themselves confidently that their own actions would tell better, and such as pretended to a delicacy of conscience, although they well knew the catastrophe that was to follow, flattered themselves no blame hereafter could be theirs, that the direful weight of crime, if any there was, had been heaped on the shoulders of others, and that they had pursued a prudent and honest course; for with such selfish principles doth a little and narrow minded man entrench and satisfy himself on his own conduct, seeing with his prejudices, and caring for himself alone—in such a limited light, in that one single contracted point of view did the judges of Leisler look on the procedure by which they became accessaries to his fate, nor bore in mind the vivid and plain circumstances that were combined with the act, which while they plumed themselves on their impartiality, rendered them parties in guilt; for to the most unwilling, there was evident but one construction of the act with which the Court concluded this trial, and that could not be otherwise than unfavourable, setting the participators in the proceedings down as either ignorant or sycophants; for they had certainly performed the parts of the sluth hounds, who, after driving the game in the huntsman's ring, from which there was no escape, stand by panting with delight while the knife is drawn across the throat of the deer, eager and rejoicing in the portion of the spoil which their masters might award them for their activity and exertion in their service; and now having in this manner determined the fate and trial of Leisler, the Court rose to dissolve its sitting; and it was commanded, that ere the judges departed from their seats, that the prisoner should be conducted back to the cell wherein he had heretofore been confined, but that additional care should be taken in his guard, and that like one past condemnation, he should be strongly and heavily ironed, and no one on any account whatever, except with a special order, should be allowed admittance or intercourse with him, but that his dungeon should be cleared of its other miserable inhabitants, that his durance might be lone and solitary, as that of a man sentenced to suffer death. Long ere the court broke up from its arduous and wearisome task of deliberation, the light of the lantern by which they were assembled waned and flickered with heavy and broken beams; while striking through the gloom and shadow of the apartment, there darted from the chinks and vents cut in the shape of half moons in the casement shutters, bright and vivid gleams proclaiming that day had dawned without. A pleasure came even in the midst of his wretchedness with the coming morning, to the seared heart of Leisler, for another night,—a fearful night to him had passed,—a night of oppression, ignominy and suffering; and that which he might have expected had happened, his veriest doubts had been assured, and it now became him to play the part alone which should not hereafter be a reproach to his name; but otherwise with the sorrow-stricken Arnyte;—in his misery he noted not the flitting hours, and when he heard the hoarse voice of the jailer bid his father arise from the place whereon he had sat during the trial, and follow him to his prison-house, he with an involuntary motion started forward to accompany him, but was sternly forbid;—then with a piteous bewailing, like the infant torn from its mother, he besought, as he clung to his father's garment, the allowance of the court to proceed with him to his incarceration, but he was rudely and harshly denied the favour he so earnestly requested; and although again and again he appealed to the personal commiseration of the judges, the more determinately and angrily was his perseverance repelled, and he was constrained with a heart, whose heavy throbbings shook his bosom nigh to bursting, in its fearful agony, though with an eye parched and tearless, to gaze on the departing step of his father, as he quitted the fatal apartment wherein he had been judged so partially, to proceed with slow and mournful pace to the dark cell, which the foreboding mind of Arnyte pictured as the last resting place,—the only habitation wherein he was to reside with life; and as the hollow and dismal clanking of a massy weight of chains already prepared to load the limbs of the unfortunate prisoner, and carried at his side by one of the jailer's assistants, struck on the anxious hearing of the youth, the sharp sound pierced to his very brain, like the warning tollings of a funereal bell; and when he beheld Leisler cross the threshold of the doorway that led from the room, his overwhelming grief of soul burst its bounds, and for the moment he could not restrain the wild promptings of nature; but in spite of encircling guards, fierce looks, and threatening words, he rushed after the parent from whom he had been severed, and snatching his hand, he pressed it with a long and convulsive motion, now to his breast, and now to his quivering lip, until thrust back by ungentle hands and ruder force; and when thus at last torn from his trembling hold, he met a sad, lorn, lingering look which his father as he was hurried away from him cast back, the deep and touching expression of that speechless glance came over him like a withering blow from the wild and darting lightning—he stood as one frozen to the spot, powerless and inanimate, with vision strained and gazing on a receding object, in which every faculty was wrought and magnetized, like the spirit in the first moments of departure, turning towards the loved ones of earth whom it is leaving, as it were for evermore; and when his receding form was nearly lost to the sight, beneath the darksome shadows of the ponderous architraves under which he and such as guarded him passed, and as they disappeared in the long, narrow and gloomy way, they seemed as though swallowed in the jaws of the tomb, and when he could distinguish no trace, when even the echo of the distant footsteps was silent,—then, as one wounded to the death by the sudden blow of an unseen enemy, as though stricken by a blight from the air on which he breathed, the stripling sank powerless for support against the portals of the door by which he stood, and involuntarily a groan of bitter anguish escaped his utterance. The apartment wherein the court had been held for Leisler's trial was now fast deserted; one by one of those who loitered retired each to his way; few even as they passed him in departure cared to notice the situation of the desolate offspring of the man, the work of whose fate they had been busied on so late. Some there might have been who threw on him a look of pity, but that scarce ever was lasting more than while he interfered with the vision;—the next object the sight fell upon engrossed the mind to forgetfulness;—the feeling was like the minute whisperings of humanity, that go not to the disturbance of the selfish heart, from whence they emanate; and yet there were those whose undisguised rejoicings of triumph over the fall of Jacobus Leisler were vented without mercy on the youth, regardless of his sufferings, which were viewed with the same pleasure by these as a wanton and cruel urchin delights in the agonies and miserable palpitations of the quivering and heaving portions of the worm, whose body his knife hath cut and lacerated, and through each parted member of which is running the last and dying throe: but Arnyte, buried in anguish, listened not to their cold and sneering contumelies, and they, disappointed in meeting such passiveness, where was sought fire for fuel to excuse severer injuries, moved on, leaving the youth lone and neglected. —Arnyte heard them not as they left him, for a faintness was on him, and sense, sight and hearing fast failed, and suffocating emotions shook his frame, as though he had been grasped by a giant's hand;—he must have dropped upon the vaulted floor, but for the assistance of some kind and piteous stranger, whom he wotted not in his moment of agony. He was led forth without the stadthuis walls, scarce weening of a step he took; nor was it until he drank the fresh and morning breeze from the pure heavens, undefiled, that the weakness of nature gave itself forth, and his voiceless struggles were past; for then broke out agonized sobs from his labouring breast, and tears quick and fast, in beaded drops, wrung like blood from his heart strings, coursed down his cheeks in wo;—he wept aloud, and his surcharged bosom found relief, like the earth long dried and parched by burning suns of summer, and waterless from enduring drought, receiving in its fainting bosom the cooling rain, the gentle dew and offering of the pitying clouds. SECTION III.—Proceeded in. It was a mild and beautiful morning, that spoke not of the dark winter whose reign had commenced, but shone like the deceiving colour on the visage of the sick, which misleads with hope when it should foretell the dank grave and the funeral hearse. Few traces remained of the rage of the late tempest, and these seemed like the tears on the cheek of beauty, smiling even in her sorrow; the fresh air, redolent with life, balm and joy—a very thing of intelligence, breathing health and vigour to man and nature's renovation, fanned the broad surface of the living wave, disporting with the pulses of the moving waters, lifting and spreading out their swelling bosoms, like a warrior in his hour of dalliance, playing with amorous hand in the silken locks of his betrothed; while the gay and laughing light of the young sunbeam danced joyously o'er the snow and ice embound hill and dale, making them blaze as strewn with multitudinous gems, diamond and rose hued; and its genial warmth penetrated unchecked among the high walls and peaked and blackened roofs, and clustering chimneys of the city, from whose tiled pinnacles the wreaths of the melting and decaying sleet, that like a shroud had covered them, rose like incense to the shrine of the day god—earth, sky and water were as animated by one sensation of happiness and festival. The hour of the day was already somewhat advanced, and the narrow streets of the city were fast awakening to their accustomed bustle, and in quick succession the stirring burghers poured forth from their habitations, delighting in the clamour and noise their own eager and busy movements caused. The smart winkelier was arraying in the most tempting form his wares to the eye of the passing saunterer; while the shrill and lively notes of the thriving matron, with voice at topmost key, were heard from the sanded entries of each awakened dwelling, startling the half roused and nodding negro to his labour, and with its fearful sound frightening for the time his laziness of nature; here and there at the latticed window might be descried, fair and lovely as the flowers she tended, with cheek painted with the tint of health, some bashful maiden, who with soft white hand was cherishing and supporting the fallen and drooping tendrils of her favourite plants, amid the odorous waftings of whose delicious fragrance she moved, a being of light, and life, and youthful beauty; indeed at this time of the year, in honour of the approaching `Nieuw Jaar,' there were but few of the Dutch mansions of the city of New-Yorke, within whose Vol. II. 24 walls there did not flourish such bloemates as care and tenderness can preserve in the coldest seasons in bud, bloom and perfume. In the casements of the richer class might be seen leaden vases and urns, with large chased portraitures of fat and jolly divinities who figured in the heathen mythology, or the more patriotic representations of the pride of the Netherland arts and arms, the busts of the De Witts, De Ruyter, or Von Tromp, with triumphal wreaths, flags, trumpets, and all the paraphernalia of fame —these, placed on low and painted stands, were filled with the rarest and most beautiful artimesias, tulips, and greenhouse exotics of priceless value, each bulb having its name painted beneath it in large staring letters of yellow and gilt. And albeit the domiciles of the poorer sort lacked not the votive circlet for their halls, the ever-green, the furred branches of the cedar tree, and the misletoe. All within the prosperous precincts of Nieuw Amsterdam appeared moving and aroused to business— none hugged the hot and sickly comfort of the couch, except the sluggish idler or heavy drunkard, and in those days there were not many of that kind of miserable wretches —for as now, it was not made a boast either for late hours, high feasting, or deep drinking—and it was a bad excuse, that weighed but little with his crusty Dutch bos, for his apprentice to plead sickness from debauchery for late attendance to his duty. The young men were about hitching their horses to their bowl shaped sleds, cracking their whips or hailing each other in tones as loud, clear, and melodious as the music that was drawn by the nose of Handel, from the great organ at Harlæm. Outwardly, none bore the impress of the hand of grief, as each one busied in his avocation, hurried on, though at times the visage might have deceived by hollow smiles, when the soul was in agony, that the keen eye of observance marked not the shadow of existing sorrow;—all was apparently thoughtless, light of heart, and happy. Arnyte stood without the walls of his father's prison, and looked on,—a lone and solitary being, seeming as one unnoted unregarded, unperceived, and neglected, as it were, by friends and foes. The sun shone down in its golden gleam of splendour, —the breath of heaven,—the murmur of the wave spoke not strange music to the ear,—the faces of men were unchanged,—the world seemed not altered in its pursuits, and yet the fall of Leisler, a thing of yesterday, appeared erased from men's minds, as though years had rolled over it. Nathless, conjectures of his fate were made in the presence of his child, with cold, calculating indifference, as it were the death of a worm,—a creature of neither care, price, or estimation, that was debated: few mourned the event, still fewer cared to hope or to speak in terms of favour either of the unfortunate man, or of his acts;—his very family were condemned with him; they were regarded as a part of the criminal; and if an eye of pity glanced for the moment's curiosity on his solitary and deserted son, it was withdrawn as soon and abrupt, as fearful of being discovered, albeit if an ill deed or punishable offence had been committed. Arnyte, however, deadened in his feelings to exterior subjects by the anguish of his mental afflictions, still could not but notice that he was the object of neglect and scrutiny from others,—neglect from such as he of right might claim in the day of his distress, attendance and that relief which in them lay, as the remembered familiars of the decayed fortune of his house,—as the moths who fluttered in life about the light of his prosperity—scrutiny from those whose unseen observance with jealous eye, snake-like, drank in his every motion, watchful, lest any incident should arise to change the current of the fate of his doomed family, from means or guile wherewith uncertain chance should arm him, even in his present weakness. The first looked with strange sight on him, or reckless turned their backs from the glance of greeting, as the wassailer from the new-covered grave of his mate, to seek the revel, the appetite for whose wine and harlotry lives keener in his thoughts than the fresh-closed coffin of his companion; while the last, with the heedful caution of suspicion that trembles at a whisper, like the fragile leaf of the anemone, noted the minutest circumstance of his action. The pride of the youth arose, mingling with his sorrows a divided flood of despair and the bitterness of misanthrophy; he felt the cheerlessness of his situation, that placed him like an all-shunned beggar, (whose unbandaged sores beget disgust and scorn,) a being of contempt alone; and the lofty spirit that lived within the stripling's breast, though borne down with its load of grief, yet started from its lowliness of sufferance, and eagle-like, sprang upwards from the pressure of the foot of contumely.—He gave with moistened vision one last, long, lingering look at departure on the dreary walls, within whose prison confines his parent lay in durance; nor raised he his sight from that object, until his very soul, as it were, had leaped from the orbs with which he gazed, as he would have joined through bars and stone, him whom they unconsciously severed from his embrace. And as he wended him onwards in his solitary way, ever and anon, while the place was yet to be descried, he would involuntarily, by starts, cast back a piteous glance towards it, as one who is forced from a casket wherein a precious jewel is bestowed. He wandered onwards without a goal, careless whithersoe'er he bent his regardless steps, so as he fled from the presence of ingrateful man; for his young heart was weary and sick of his unkindness. He moved with a wild, unmeasured pace through the busy streets, as one that took no part of the living throng that crowded them, but as a solitary, phantom-like thing wrapt within himself, who, while all others hurried to and fro in their directed race, each busied in some particular care of the day was lonely and deserted, brooding o'er deep and silent spells of inward thought, reckless of the outward group that passed him in his meditation. Fearful in the moment of his abstraction were the picturings of his imagination; ingenious in the invention of torments to his lacerated feelings, and unbroken by dreams of hope or confidence,—there swam before his eyes visions of death, cruel and harrowing, of which vain were endeavours to disperse—the bloody scaffold,— the gore dripping axe,—the dim, terrible figure of the headsman, with savage and triumphant frown; and there fronted him the bodiless head, whose indistinct visage grew fast into recognition,—with hair clotted,—pallid and clayey cheeks, and lips knit in death's agony—his very flesh trembled at the torturing view; and then arose as eager of inventive pain, dark and dismal terrors of violence, of abuse and of poison, that might be committed in the secrecy of those prison boundaries;—not one of the thousand ways which could be struck on by the most desperate murtherer to rid him of a hated foe, but was painted visibly to the mind of Arnyte; and he shuddered in very fear at the dread shadows of his alarmed brain. Thus cherishing and brooding over in secret and silence his unhappiness, he roamed to the outskirts of the city; —no tender voice of consolation or assistance,—not one frank, kind question from the many known in better days, whom he met ere he attained the Poort, was advanced at him; and yet it wanted but a whisper of commiseration, for the heart, sick and tried with grief, in an instant o'erflows like the eyes of infancy, in whose glassy brilliance tears and smiles alternate reign, to have unlocked, as from the sources of a fountain, every channel of his pent up sorrows—it lacked but the benignant countenance of pity, and the outstretched arm of protection to be extended, for the stripling to have grasped at its support in very helplessness; still as it was, the trials he had undergone in the past night, he appeared scarce to be conscious to have suffered; he knew not, or seemed not to know, as he walked onward, the overpowerings of fatigue; but his hollow and vacant look, and pallid cheek bespoke the faintness of his o'er laboured body; however, he sought no food nor rest, but albeit as lacking not these, with undetermined course he proceeded beyond the city pallisades; nathless ere he had gone this distance, there had been those who had accosted him; but these were few, and they had approached him with cold words of comfort, that they decked their lips withal, but which were far from their hearts. They were of those who talk of patience, and give counsel to misery, yet would not stretch their hands to pluck from the water the drowning man, to whom they had so kindly lent advice. Arnyte listened impatiently to their guidance; their busy tones sounded in his ears like the 24* fretting drone of a gnat; their words worried him to madness, although that which they taught sank profitless in his hearing as water in a sieve; for his was not a wo to be relieved by the timely proverbs or philosophical applications ever ready in the mouths of such dotard dreamers, who preach quiet to a wretched soul burdened with adversity, as they would eat a meal from custom. In truth the voices of these men and their measured kindness fell like ice bolts on the soul of the sufferer, searing and withering instead of healing, for they bared his wounds to the very quick,—they discovered how wide was his wretchedness and desolation,—they wrecked at one dark swoop the youthful enthusiasm of his confiding nature. The path which Arnyte had unwittingly taken led direct from the old Water Poort,[25] [25] The Gate, and the Block House appertaining, stood at the intersection of the present Pearl and Wall streets. or East-river gate, over the suburb street, called the Green-lane, and passing the Smee's Vly and Beekman's hill, continued to wind along from the city, by a low, slimy shore, fringed with the bare and leafless sprouts of the osier, whose winter blackened branches were hung with multitudinous icicles that were rattled by the morning breeze, and glittered in the light of the gay sun, who, from his gorgeous pavilion of curtaining clouds, dispensed around upon the frosty earth, —the feathery thorn, and the proud spire, alike, loveliness and life. Here and there at the side of the way, were interspersed amid the wild shrubs and stumps that vein the soil or grow forth like excrescences of nature, in salt and marshy land,—the scarred trunks of a stunted polled willow, while at intervals on some small and cleared space of ground which bore traces of cultivation, rose on the sight some hovel, half mud and half logs, with paneless window and patched roof, the dwelling of a fisher, (for the Dutch landsmen hugged the higher and richer country,) whose inmate's occupation was proclaimed by the huge heaps of frozen oyster-shells about the door, the threshold of which was thronged by sportive and breechless urchins, regardless of the weather, playing and tumbling about like young porpoises upon the surface of the river, or echoing back the call and hail from the lusty-throated negro, who plied the paddles of the passing skiff, that shot in sight like an arrow on the green waters, on its way to the city, loaded with market truck. Now freed of the city, Arnyte seemed to have shook off something that had clogged his pace, and his steps were redoubled, as though the swifter he left behind him the residence of humanity, the more that which distracted him was absorbed; the very air relieved him, as he thought; and now more and more the congregated hum of man subsided, the less terrible was the conflict of his mind in appearance; but it deceived;—for still deep and lasting was the fire that consumed him; he only stilled his pangs of heart for the moment, as the Spartan boy cloaked the stolen fox to tear his entrails forth; nathless, he hurried on, as though he left behind a den of wolves, from whose rapacious hunger nought was in safety. He pursued the road, busied with grief, nor noted the kind salute of the honest boer, as he drove by in his gay sled, whose jingling bells rang out their merry peal, until he was far out of sight; nor gave he return to the `Mynheer, hoe is het met u dis morgen,'—with which he was addressed by the light-hearted labourer, who with axe on shoulder, crossed the road towards the upland fields, and who, surprised at the inattention of the youth to his social greeting, stood awhile to gaze after his rapid steps, deeming strange things, in his wonderment, of the unfortunate stripling, both from his wild looks, and the disordered pace wherewith he moved, regardless of obstacle or hurt. The road which young Leisler had pursued after following the irregular windings of the beach of the Oost Vloed, for a considerable distance through a swampy and unfruitful country, the very pathway at times encroached on from the water by creeks, and on the land by morasses, at length opened on a small stream or rather rivulet, which was called the fresh water river; and which deriving its birth from a lagoon of fresh water, known by the name of the De Kolck,[26] [26] In later years called the Collect. at flood times with no insignificant strength connected the parent pool with the waves of the East River, whose tide rising several feet higher than that of its sister river the Nordt Vloed, caused a water communication across the island; for the fresh water pond on its opposite side was joined to the lordly Hudson by a streamlet whose natural channel had been widened by a mill run. The shores of the De Kolck were diversified with wind mills and neat Dutch mansions; the first strong and substantially built with stone, having the dates of their erection in ornamental figures of iron on their fronts in the same fashion in which they adorned the gable ends of the houses in the city, while their huge fans extended at their sides, seemed like the covering shield of some warlike form;—and the last raised on the very brink of the water, and many times ran far out in the lagoon itself, which was dyked around each dwelling after the manner of some of the great mansions on the canals in the Vaderlandts, the taste of whose superstructure and situation had struck the architect's fancy so potently, that as far as nature would allow, he had copied it in building in the Nieuw Nederlandts; so that the owner might step in his schouw from the very door of his dwelling, or look from his bed-chamber window, wrapped in his morning gown and covered with his night cap, and as he smoked his merschaum, eye the dipping of his poultry in the clear waters of the stream, or watch the sportive counsel of his thriving congregation of geese and ducklings as they sailed delighted on the smooth wave, which ran murmuring in echo to their amorous parlance about the homesteads of the puissant masters of their destinies. At this time the De Kolck was frozen over, and its mirrored surface presented to the sight a glass whereon there seemed a reflection of the stilly heavens, unbroken save where from 'neath the gelid sheet that enclosed the water, there broke forth in a wild torrent of foam, over some temporary dam or flood gate, the unbridled current —the dashing spray wantoning and leaping about as rejoicing at having burst its thraldom, looked in its wild and headlong flow like the snowy flakes of froth flung from the fiery nostrils of a gallant war steed, as he champs the curb and paws the dust in his impatience— while the hollow and continued sound of the falling cataract, chafing in angry mood the encroaching ice, like a proud spirit contending with an invader, was like the distant and long repeated noise of a conflict of warring armies, the echo of whose desperate struggles shakes the burthened earth; and where the sleety covering of the liquid element was illuminated by the rays of the morning, its dazzling and unsullied surface of living chrystal glowed with tints of every hue that far out-vied the fantasies of art; cerulean and roseate, sapphire and emerald, mocking the richest gems of the lapidary.—Here and there scattered on the face of the imprisoned pond, where the ice was thickest, could be seen the hardy skater, enwrapped in his warm cloak and balanced by his poised stick, disporting and marking out curves and fantastic figures on the polished and frozen visage of the lagoon—now darting along swift as a winged shaft shotten from a bow— now circling and cleaving with rapid heel, quick as the following of sight itself, the congealed bosom of the streamlet, anon shooting hither, then thitherward as a thing borne by the wanton sweep of the invigorating breeze, at a moment's will, taking one course, pursued by his eager fellows, and again, like the swoop of the lammer geyer, round an alpine peak to avoid their playful grasp, eluding the extended hand of his sanguine companion, he wheels abrupt unto an adverse way, leaving his baulked pursuer, unwitting of his drift, to take a wider circuit,—all skimming away in their revelry, like a flight of swallows, cutting the clouds in the merriment of their summer lives. There too, within a stone's cast of the beach, though often some venturesome little varlet, was perceived making his way far out towards the centre of the pool, braving, in his gambols, the mournful and warning voice of the groaning and creaking ice on which he rambled, and on whose treacherous support he relied, while at many times, in mere hardihood of mischief he enlarged the air holes of the stream by breaking away the surrounding snow, delighting in the gladsome gurgling forth of the released waters, nor dreamed in his rash sport of the danger he tempted, frolicked troops of merry children, some of whom were gliding on the breast of the frozen lagoon in mimicry of the more fortunate skater, with small pieces of wood or bone fitted to the bottom of their feet, avidious of their slippery and precarious enjoyment—some, a mingled band of male and female, black and white, throwing themselves in various attitudes, grotesque and gamesome, chased each other in sliding on places, which they, by repeated and successive trips, had worn smooth as the finest silk, and on which, it was scarce possible to stand or walk, without risking a limb to the person who braved their slipperiness, albeit, well accustomed to so perilous a labour; some, who with their mates, had deserted the sides of the slanting, Flattenbarrack, the lofty Golden, and the noble Potbaker's hills, were engaged in racing their miniature sledges, that were gayly ornamented after the style of their originals, which paraded the streets of New-Yorke to the music of their many tinkling bells; while these bore the name of some Dutch hero, skipper, dorp or dogger, fancifully painted and decorated on them, in accordance to the humour and whim of the sportive and thoughtless owner, who urged the course of his ingenious imitation, either astride or laying on his breast, with legs outstretched, to guide the route resembling a flying squirrel, except in pace; and there were others, weary for the time, or the excluded, albeit, envious of the partakers of the sports from which they were discarded, that in herds and groups were assembled, and gazed on the merry career of their competitors. There was the tender school boy, wrapped close from the chillness of the raw winter atmosphere by his careful mother, with ears bandaged and 'kerchief about his neck, guarding him from sickness, and with hand warmly encased in his party coloured mittens, whose clumsy fingers scarce served him to sustain the satchel that contained the hated task, and which, while he loitered, remembered him of his Dutch primer, and the surly frown and uplifted rod of his querulous preceptor, so apt to disregard the ready tears and faltering excuse. There too, was the little idler, the young lawless vagabond, whom the lash, the gentle word, nor scolding, could control or confine to his duty, with tattered and crownless hat, through the yawning gaps of which, peeped his stray and blowsed locks, utterly regardless of his ragged jacket, wantonly lacerated attire and shoeless foot, he capered, tossed, tumbled and floundered about, like an eel fresh drawn from its native element; and now, slily and unseen, sending at his heedless companions, for the sake of riot, hardened balls of snow, anon whooping and shouting, shrieking and yelling from triumph, as his favourite wins in the game hefore him, though many times for no reason, except for noise and wantonness—his hands, toes and face, unprotected and uncovered, and died to the very redness of the ripened cherry, from the sharp and piercing breeze as it stole along, gathering chillness, from the pond itself, while the hardy urchin, apparently delighted in defying its keenness, rather than flinched from its pinching and hungered bite. In good sooth, all on the wide spread De Kolck, from the clumsy garbencumbered Dutch lad, with his three cornered hat, double broeks, worsted stockings and plated knee buckles, the merry eyed maiden with close cut coif, to the grinning and curly pated offspring of the kitchen negroes who shared the play, was one throng of holiday laughter and jocund hilarity—the bright and mirthful glee of youth—of that spring-tide of life, when sorrow is ever but as the last drops of a summer shower, through which sunbeams are breaking—when death and wo are heard of as a fireside tale, that saddens for a moment the sparkling countenance, but whose terrors are soon forgotten in the laugh of joy, and that unrepressed vivacity less experienced of the instability of hope, which sees nothing but happier days, and gayer garlands in futurity. Arnyte paused not a moment on the sight of the happy rout, for the pleasures of others do but tend to mock the deserted creature of misery—like green fields and sunny glades, for which he longs in vain as he gazes through his prison bars, are to the eyes of the desolate convict—like the voice of the healthful, in the ear of the sick man, bringing with its sound but a bitter comparison of the wretchedness of his poisoned lot; even so with a face jaundiced with an evil, as if when he had cause for tears, it were unmeet it should be catered, otherwise to any, doth he that is racked of heart, regard the wreathed smile of the gay, or the mingled shout and tread of revelry or merriment—for misfortune makes those at whom she darts her snakelike fangs, at once selfish and envious, turning to the bitterest gall all liberal and inborn virtue—for its victim deems in the madness of his trials, that on him alone the curse of Ishmael hath fallen, that all men's hands are against him, and he feels as if against all men he could gladly turn the besom of destruction. Hastily, therefore, did young Leisler pass over the little bridge of logs that crossed the outlet or rather arm of the De Kolck, and rushed forward on the path, which, on the farther side of the rivulet, ascended with a winding course, a somewhat rising tract of country, overlooking in its tortuous sweep, the fresh water pond and all its busy crowd, the sound of whose diversions, uprose to the higher ground as from the bosom of a valley. Having kept an uneven route for a short time, and risen insensibly to a considerable height above the water, which, caught in glimpses through clumps of hanging fir trees, gloomy rocks, snow and embedded ice, looked like a silver mirror, the road suddenly branched off in two separate ways, the one proceeding and extending in the neighbourhood of the Oost vloed towards the Nechtant or Coerlar's Hoek, and the other running far up in the open country, pursued its course past the landhuisen of the Bayards, the Rombouts, the Minthornes, and the Stuyvesants, until it reached Bestavers Killitjie, and the Spijt den duyvel Kill. The progress of Arnyte had been somewhat in unison with the disorder of his mind—at times his pace was slow, hesitating and thoughtful, with brows bent as perusing the earth on which they were unconsciously fixed, and so silent and noiseless was his step that he startled not, until close upon him, the watchful snow-bird that sat chirping upon the lowermost branches of the naked trees that skirted the way-side, and who when frightened skimmed with his dark wing the frozen surface of the snowy ground as he sought a safer perch; and then anon as if by speed he could disperse from his disquieted mind the horrors of the gloomy clouds that thronged upon him, he hurried along with rapid, unmindful, and violent strides and look disturbed and unsettled as one who flies from the hot pursuit of an armed and deadly foe. It was in one of these last described paroxysms of grief that he approached the division of the road, and before he was well aware of his presence, he came nigh rushing on a person who had stationed himself at the very fork of the path; he had but a chance to check his headlong career within a pace of the stranger, by whom he was unperceived, and who thus abruptly thrown on the observance of the youth was one who from the singularity of his position and appearance, had the power to draw his attention for the time, having his eye once fixed upon this object, relieving his more dismal meditations with surprise and conjecture; for it scarce needed a repetition of his glance for young Leisler to recognize with wonderment, in spite of the unlucky disposition of his garments through rags, filth and tatters the still burley visage and portly form of Ensign Jost Stoll, whom the fears of the youth had of a certainty long since given up as a mournful feast to the grave worm or the mountain eaglet; and in sooth reader it was our old acquaintance hearty, but somewhat worn by suffering, yet safe and graphical as ever, in defiance of the almost unheard of straits, travail, turmoil, and danger he had undergone since the narrative left him in consequence of his own obduracy, at the mercy of the pirate's steel, in the ruined wigwam—a forlorn and selfentangled sacrifice for the blood-thirsty buccaneer to satiate his cruel spleen upon for the escape of his intended victim; and indeed it had fared severely with the rash amateur, his life had been spared it was true, but that was nearly all that he had escaped with, being stript by the plunderer of every article of value, even to his bare flesh—at the first burst of rage from the pirate at his being baffled as to Sloughter, the ensign's existence hung but on a word, and it was but the change of a whim—the humour of the moment that prevented the luckless wight's having his heart rent from its casket, an immolation to Vol. II. 25 the savage fury of the intemperate Kid—but it seemed the rover being disappointed in the principal object of his expedition, the capture of Sloughter and the rifling of the despatches and papers of which the Colonel was the bearer, and the contents of which as injurious, by authorizing effective proceedings against his illicit courses, to the prosperity of the free trade of the buccaneer, by some secret advices which (an the rumour of the day is to have credence) came from no mean source, had been made known to the desperate marauder, he apparently disdained to wreak his anger or revenge on the mere secondary personage who was left in his hands;—the first passion having somewhat subsided in the heat of immediate pursuit made unsuccessfully after the fugitive captives, and day fast dawning at the return of those who had followed the trail, and disliking the incumbrance of the Ensign in the march, on dispersing his confederates and Kid's making for his boats which were moored in concealment and ambush in the nearest inlet to the place where the scene of the past night had been transacted, he gave directions to his followers to enlarge the luckless prisoner, which however was not done until they had disrobed him completely of every garment to which they took a fancy, bestowing on him nevertheless in return the most tattered, worthless, and ragged portions of their own wardrobes, in spite of every entreaty for moderation made to their ruthless compassion—and as it were out of mere malice and wilful fancy, not content with heaping the most outrageous indignities on the helpless bondsman, they with most atrocious cruelty beat and pricked him with their naked cutlasses until his very back ran seams of welled gore, all the while mocking, with hideous and brutal laughter, the acuteness of his sufferings;— and even terrible as were the torments thus inflicted, the ensign was fortunate that their commander grudged them time, ere the fierce adventurers could put in force worse tortures—for there were some among the band who meditated his murder, for the purpose of giving, according to their rude and maritime superstition, charge to his spirit, who, they supposed, would keep the trust, such wealth and treasure as they had amassed in their unlawful voyages, and buried or concealed about the rocks and in the earth around this spot of their harbourage; for such was the wild idea, that while the riches were in keeping of the dead, no mortal hand, save their own, could ever touch them; and under this impression, many are the golden ingots and wedges,—crosses of diamonds torn from the hand of the trembling devotee, moidores, ducats, and pieces of eight, the spoil of the conquered flota and galleons of Spain, and the haughty Portuguese, which lay rusting to this day, in the sod of the Manahadoes, unclaimed and unknown—the hands which deposited them, being colder, and as powerless as the metals themselves—the stern acquirers having perished on the wave, or in the blood-stained breach of some stormed town, leaving none in the secret of the gain they left from their dangerous toils, their murders or their battles, save the eternal heavens, whose cold and silent moon, gilds, with its light at full, the hidden spot, but whose direction, living eye can read not— and the melancholy forest, whose mournful whisper prates not to human ear of the place of their concealment. And when indeed at last, the unfeeling tormentors quitted the sinking object of their brutal sport, yielding not to a weariness of cruelty, but reluctantly, to the frequent and impatient calls of their fierce leader, who, having, as is before shown, dispatched Eumet to carry the eventful tidings of Sloughter's arrival to Leisler, and his interested protectors of the faction, embarked on board his light armed shallop, and spread his broad sails from the shore; they left the abused soldier nearly fainting, and almost insensible from excruciating pain, in a wood path, where they had driven or rather dragged him, from the neighbourhood of their den, cautious lest he should know the tract that might discover the wigwam. Overpowered with weakness, his dull ear awoke to no sound in that which seemed his last mortal agony, save the sudden and sharp howl of the hungry and voracious wolf, as he approached from the neighbouring brake, and caught the scent of an expected banquet; the miserable sufferer might have perished on the spot where he had been cast by the ruthless buccaneer, unable from weakness, or unwilling from despair, to exert his remaining powers to a single effort to preserve life, but for the fortunate approach of a hunter. By the hardy and compassionate son of the chace, he was assisted to an adjacent log hut, from whose poor but hospitable inmates, his wounded limbs and bruised body, received every tendance and care, their limited resources could supply; they fed his parched lips with the renovating balsam of the fever tree, and the juice of the aromatic anise; they stanched the gory flowings on his lacerated flesh, with the life-preserving essence of many a wild Indian herb, unknown to the votaries of science; the heart-shaped leaves of the deer's tongue, the sassafras and the star weed, lent their genial powers; and the rude art of his kind hosts, with needful rest, restored him far sooner to health, strength and spirits, than could the false trickeries of the mediciner—so that, having been set on his way, by his benevolent entertainers, Jost Stoll had proceeded the distance on the road, when Arnyte recognised him, to rejoin his late comate and fellow traveller, the now governor of the colony of New-Yorke. But however, in the pursuance of this last intention, the ensign's journey was by no means one of great expedition—for his route was through the wild and picturesque land, scarce trodden, and perchance heretofore unnoted—but on which no eye of painter, or of the lover of untutored nature, could gaze unmoved, or pass by without admiration—for as he wended onwards, now beside the road, there swelled like heavings of the mountainous billow, high and majestic hills; less, had been the theme of fame in other lands, but nameless they stood within the desert and the solitude, clad in their shroud of winter; the stern gigantic battlements of nature, along whose icy walls, like armed warriors, towered skyward mighty and gnarled trees, whose limbs, brown, bare and without foliage, were stretched out as defying the tempest to hurl them from their rooted seats—and now, first on the ear like the hollow rumbling of an earthquake, and anon, burst on the sight of the enraptured pedestrian, the roar of the precipice of waters, as like the timorous hart flying from the pursuing hound, delirious with affright, the bright wave in flashing masses of foam and flood, leaped wildly from rock to rock, while each rude cleft that received the bounding fall glittered with crystal incrustations and fantastic masses of ice, the snow white spray freezing as it sprung and scattered on the dark surface of the granite, like jewels round the neck of an æthiop; and then as he emerged from these primeval ramparts of crag and highland, there would come on the view, the deep and silent glade, the sloping dells, and the dark forest gorges and defiles, all lovely and fair to see, even with the fleecy covering of the season—beautiful in their dreariness, like the young and innocent in death, upon whose blanched lips sets the fixed and peaceful smile the spirit left at parting;—and yet withal, the white and ghastly desolation, told not of the rich and holiday aspect, worn by those wild and solitary vales, rugged crags, and desert glens, in their hour of summer glory, few of whose relics remained, and these hung like withered trophies in the winter's dreariness; no more the ground glowed in its carpet of deep green sward, from whose rich sod leaped up the wildling green and budding woodland flower, fresh in its childhood, making redolent with its aromatic breath the odorous breeze with living fragrance; no more the juniper, the ivy vine, and the rhodendrum, clung to the fissures and crevices of the rocks, swathing their iron breasts as with a mantle; the copsewood was no longer garlanded with dewy foliage, nor did the luxuriant trees flaunt their spiry heads as wont, like gay banners o'er a festal rout; the busy winglet of the humming bird was hushed, and the stock dove's gentle murmurings, filled not the air with music longer—but all the scene was naked—desolate, as if a blast had come upon the beauty and the pride of that fair wilderness, and stricken its splendours with the pallidness and coldness of the silent tomb. As the doughty ensign passed through this romantic country, he found that neither the danger that it 25* had exposed him to, nor the sufferings which he had endured mainly for its sake, had expelled his ancient passion and habit, but it came on him as with redoubled force, and frequent were its irresistible promptings and attacks, that induced him to linger on the dale, and pause enraptured, on the peak of mount and hill as he soberly trudged forward, that at leisure, his eager eye might drink in the boundless prospect, and all the liberal profuseness of creation, whose blooming and brightest wealth, thus as it were unknown, unculled, and nearly unseen by human eye, bespoke how little was the world made for the vain creature of humanity, who hath the audacity to claim it as his own—man fond man, a god in presumption, and yet a mote, an atom, in reality—worthless as the dust, that is played on by the wind. Oftentimes, as he went along, the ready hand of our connoiseur, transferred, with pliant power, the scenes which enrapt his vision, in a skeleton form, to the surface of a crumpled and dirty bit of vellum, which, with the tender and assiduous care a mother strives to shield from harm and hurt her sickly infant, Jost Stoll had made out to preserve, amid the severest trials of his late adversities, and whose motley visage presented a heterogeneous mass of objects, mingled and confused, from the innumerable subjects gathered by the avidious amateur, at nearly every step. In the last instance, sometime before young Leisler had advanced on his road, the ensign had, for a better view, elevated himself on the very topmost bar of a rough hewn fence of pine or cedar logs, which kinds of wood, splitten on the spot where often they had been felled and placed transversely, for the most part formed the rude enclosures of the settler's cultivated land, which did not, many times, exceed an half acre, a patch chosen where the soil was richest and most free from impediments of sterility; the earnest soldier sat poised snug and secure, as apparently, on his narrow and uncomfortable seat, with legs crossed, patiently, in support of the object of his labour, and so avidious of the satisfaction he mentally enjoyed, as scarce to perceive the least inconvenience of a minor nature, when compared to his pleasure. On his head, he had an aged hat, slouched on one side, so as at once to give a knowing and burlesque air to the countenance it enshadowed, being, nevertheless, of itself, somewhat as rare a curiosity as its wearer—for it showed, with rueful aspect, the sad effect of time and long and faithful service, having neither shape, manner, nor fashion, and being withal a most woful spectacle of decrepitude, so perforated with holes and cruel rents, as to resemble a keg riddled with pistol balls: the plunderers had left him no weapon of any sort, and his goodly rapier was absent from his sturdy thigh—a shrunk and tattered mantle, and that which may be termed an apology for a pair of galligaskins, so tattered, torn and stained, that it would have puzzled the shrewdest antiquarian, to have decided on its original texture and form—finished his complement of garment, or more properly speaking, his hangings; so strange and wretched an appearance, did the once gay soldier present from the robber's hand, that albeit, looking so very an emblem of distress as he did, had he offered to stroll the streets of Nieuw Amsterdam at noon day, he would not alone risked the fretfulness of each snappish hound, who, fattened at his master's feet, for very spleen, barks at poverty, sickening at the sight, like the purse proud, and the upstart—but he certainly would have run a fair chance of an intimate acquaintance, by means of the friendly intercession of Mass Garrit Abeel, the little waddling Dutch overseer of the poor, with the stadt werkhuis, which was the miniature counterpart of the famous one on the Westperveld in the Low Countries, and was always kept by a sufficient person, the office sometimes with others being adjoined, that is, when there was no beggarly alderman to hunger for the salary, as a kind of sinecure to the mayoralty—his honour, the Schout, being also commissioned coroner and clerk of the market. So entirely was Jost Stoll engrossed in his occupation, the matter of which might have been readily surmised from his posture and glances, which last were now quickly thrown towards the distant de Kolck and all its mingled assemblage, and then with intense intention, reverted to that which he had delineated, so he neither seemed to hear nor see, or to be stirred by motion or sound, within his immediate neighbourhood, while at times, a smirk of inward gratification would move the muscles of his face, as he triumphed in the success of that on which he was employed; and ever and anon, with strange grimace of peculiar admiration, he would twist his head in one direction at first, and then in another, as the sketch at which he so greedily worked, pleased his steadfast taste and imagination. The ensign saw not the startled look of the stripling, nor heard his first ejaculation of surprise. “How?—what—am I to believe my sight deceives not?” exclaimed Arnyte after a short silence, wherein he strove to recover his amazement at the unlooked for rencounter, “art thou unharmed, safe from the savage anger of the rover—safe—safe from the bloody knife of murther—can such things happen? The ways of heaven are indeed provident and merciful; seeing this, why should I despair—is there no hope also for me?” At this address of mixed astonishment and soliloquy, the Ensign, with a peevish start of body, elevated his brows, drew up the corners of his mouth in wrinkles, and twisted in very pettishness the muscles of his visage, giving at the same time a burlesque cast of ruefulness and dolour to his whole countenance, like one who hath unawares swallowed an unpleasant medicinal potion; but, nevertheless, his face underwent this change of aspect from its former placidity without his raising in the least his sight from that which he was tracing (for to that his eyes were held as enraptured) towards the person who accosted him, nor did he in any wise alter either posture or attitude, nor stirred he a limb, save an impatient drumming of one of his feet against the log on which it rested, so as to discontinue his genial task; but he the rather appeared to ply thereat with increased and renewed determination, and sooth he worked away with all the freshness of effort wherewith an high spirited and indignant stripling, having escaped from the restraining hands of pacifying arbitrators, flies at his taunting adversary who hath seemingly challenged a renewal of battle while his opponent was withheld from the combat. “Now by mine halidome! this is provoking—the road ha? you've eyes—follow your nose; its long enough to guide you—an't it damnable! detestable! forsooth, I meant, —my dear fellow!” growled Jost Stoll, busily employed while speaking, which was with the hasty manner of one whose pleasure is abruptly and unceremoniously broken upon by the hated voice of scholastic advice, or as though an ill natured gnat had wound his buzzing pipe about his ear and nose, in defiance of his fretful endeavour to drive away the humming insect, and evidently mistaking Arnyte for some troublesome passenger on the way, who had made inquiry at him of the path, “Now by mine troth! this would perplex a saint—my master, an you'd use sight, you need not vex your neighbours thus: thy unwise hurry hath drove me wrong in this outline;” he went on, “faith, master, time's a beggar, and would wrong one of a sketch that might honour Frans Mieris or old Breugel. Hum! ha! Gad, I have it! I have it!” continued he, suddenly changing his tone to exultation, “by the hand of Carlo Maratti, that touch hath given it new spirit—there's life! there's soul! it is nature's self! Sir Godfrey would die of envy, did he see this winter landscape o' mine—the putting on of that last shade is inimitable! it improves the whole aspect from its former state, making it like the master piece of De Rhyn when compared to the insipid works of a Crayer, Schut or Van Balen.” And having thus spoken aloud the overflowings of his heart with unrestrained delight, the Ensign pursued his occupation, apparently relapsed into his former heedlessness of all around, and solely attentive to that at which both heart and mind were at once enchained in pleasant slavery; and indeed it was not until after several repeated attempts, that young Leisler succeeded in arousing the soldier from his infatuation, and attracted his dormant curiosity, and then it was not until he had explained his altered dress and appearance, and by a relation of circumstances stamped his truth, that the stripling was recognized as his fellow in the wigwam by the marvelling Jost Stoll, who could scarce, in his joy at the meeting, reconcile the chance that had so strangely brought them again together—again and again he told the tale of his sufferings, feeling as if in the repetition of each incident he found a satisfaction; and in truth there is an indescribable pleasure in telling those dangers we have braved to such as we believe sympathize and rejoice with us, that nearly repays for all that in the endurance hath been borne, and this was felt by the honest ensign in the highest degree, that for awhile he had nearly forgot his sketch, though that was not long, for scarce had the paroxysm past of his joy, ere he thrust on the examination of the youth, and teased him with the explanation of his labours; but the ensign, selfish as he was in this particular, could not be blind to the obvious inattention of his auditor to that which he exhibited, and though at the first, he was somewhat irritated and offended, yet, on remarking severely at Arnyte's neglect, as he looked in the youth's face, he was struck with the settled sorrow and despair that in his speaking visage was fearfully depicted. The warm hearted amateur thrust his vellum in his bosom, pocketed his pencil, and having gazed for a minute in silence in his face, he questioned the stripling in a voice soothing and inviting confidence, and with a manner replete with persuasive kindness on the cause of his apparent sorrow. “For God's sake, my young master, what aileth thee? quoth the ensign;—“thou lookest more like the picture of a corse, than one whose only tint should be the bloom of health—why, man, your countenance hath the bloodless, heart-appalling hue which Rembrandt hath spread over his painting of Belshazzer's vision of the hand-writing on the wall—nay, cheer thee, my brave cavalier; it is a friend that bids thee have comfort; give me thy hand, youngster, and unbosom thy load of grief; mayhap Jost Stoll may find a means to lighten that which now seemeth to burthen thee so heavily.” It had been a long time since one frank question, thus dictated by the voice of friendship, had broke with a consolatory effort on the bereaved and benumbed heart of Arnyte; it was not the words, nor the manner which Jost Stoll warmly grasped his hand, that unlocked, as from a pent up stream, all the withered feelings of his soul: but young Leisler saw, or deemed be read sincerity in his companion's every look, and the thought, that he had once risked his life for his rescue, though unavailing, confirmed, as it were, faith in his sympathy; for it is hard to believe that such as have been with us in the hour of need and peril, and have shared its stress, should be cold to us in our solitary woes; and the poor soldier is struck deepest by denial, when he seeks alms of a brother warrior. As he rehearsed the doleful incidents of the ruin of his family to his companion, the eyes of the stripling overran, and tears as fast, as free, as rain drops from summer clouds, fell on his cheeks; and the voice of his story was tremulous, inarticulate and broken, although he vainly strove for manly resolution; that firmness with which he had fronted the court was fled in the presence of one, before whom he deemed there was no need for exercise of pride; albeit, the energy wherewith he had borne himself was but as a cloak around a wounded body, concealing for a time the terror of the heart, but which at last is made known, by the bursting forth of flooding gore. “Now, by mine halidome!” cried the ensign, scarce waiting to hear in patience the conclusion of the youth's recital of misfortune, while as he spoke, his features beamed with a glad smile of solace and resolution;— “why, my master, art thou so wrapt,—so lost in the depths of misery as to see no hope to catch at? art blind, man, to mourn thus over irretrievable sorrow, when relief is within a pallet's length of thy grasp;—why, thy case is but like a gem of antiquity,—a rare painting, that from age and ill usage, hath all its beauties obscured in darkness and dirt; sooth, man, it only lacks the cunning hand of the artist, and careful tendance, to bring forth in freshness as when first laid on, the tints and colouring; for you must know, that these in the old masters fly not like in the works of our unskilful moderns—ay, the ancients understood the art—why, what think ye?—I have seen ensamples of Guido and Titian, and that wonderful colourist, Tintoretto, that seemed as if but painted yesterday, while there are Du Jardyn's heads that scarce last a year but the white turns yellow—there's no keeping them; age improves the old masters, but destroys the daubers of our day;—but sooth, as the facts are, Mynheer Leisler, it is well you have met me; for, perchance, you might have fallen in the hands of some botching pretender, who would have advised you as vilely as he would mend a picture—gad! he'd laid on the varnish till the canvass cracked in rags, and touched and tampered with the lights and shadows, till all the sweetness of the original was merged in his own filthy paint and clumsiness. —Why, thou hast been blind as an ignorant critic, examining a fine and finished group, who sees all faults where there is nought but beauty; troth, man, why art thou not at Sloughter's elbow? does he not owe thee a life? and think ye he can have the heart to take thy father's, or to stand calmly by, while the source of the blood which was risked for his preservation is poured out like mountain wine, to quench the thirst of any living being?—no! with all his faults, Hal Sloughter can never be capable of such ingratitude; he is, it is true, a sad fellow, but could he do that,—after he hath seen thee, an he suffers thy father's death,—by my halidome! I'll—I'll— damn it, I'll paint a picture like Michael Angelo, and put him among the damned;—come, we'll to his presence. I've learned the Colonel hath his quarters at Mynheer Bayard's, for the present, until the fort is fitted for his reception. I've been seeking the place; they tell me it is hereabout; so, let us on,—we have no time to spare to the machinations of your father's enemies—though, hum—ha,—I should like to finish my sketch; it will scarce take a minute,—yet a minute may to your father's fate now he hours.—I'll leave the thing; and if thereby for ever I lose the opportunity of its perfect finish, it shall remain like Buanarotti's famous head, drawn on the wall with charcoal, in the idless of the moment,—a monument, if not of power, at least of what Jost Stoll hath sacrificed to the cause of humanity, so Mynheer Arnyte Leisler—let us onward to the Bayard mansion.” Having thus said, the Ensign seized the youth by the arm and hurried him with rapid steps forward on the road, and indeed what with the assured manner of his companion, together with the words of Sloughter when they separated after the escape from the blood-hounds of the pursuing pirate, and which now with renewed strength returned to his remembrance; there sprang forth in the heretofore desolate breast of the stripling a confidence of hope that before had not visited him in the darkness of his miseries, and that claim which he had of a return of benefit from the Governor grew in his thoughts of more magnitude than he had ever supposed it—he had been the saviour of the Colonel's life, thanks—eternal thanks, had been vowed for the deed, and certainly his excellency had been committed in honor, and by all that should be held sacred between man and man;—yet at this last thought the fearful Arnyte shuddered, for he had seen and learnt of late how little, how weak, and easy to be rent and trampled on were those holy bonds, and he well knew how wide was the difference of granting and of asking a return of favour and of gratitude; that too often the basis of the request is forgotten and lost in a calculation of personal interest, and the policy of that which is besought stands for itself without a redeeming and collateral circumstance to prompt a favourable assent—but the enthusiasm and sanguine wishes of youth conquered all latent doubts, and Arnyte rejected indignantly every harsh idea that submitted itself against the good feelings of Governor Sloughter. “Yes, kind friend, thou advisest right—thank thee! thank thee!” exclaimed the stripling rapidly, as mentally he chided the laggard brain whose promptings had not sooner presented the course to his imagination, and entering into the intention of his companion he warmly pressed the hand that held him in encouragement and support: “yes, I'll to the presence of Sloughter—he cannot have the feelings of humanity an he list not my supplication— my tears shall wring his heart—my lamentations shall Vol. II. 26 pierce him through were he marble—ay, I will see him though the accursed Bayard fence him from me with a wall of iron—yes—yes—dear father, I have yet a chance to preserve thee remaining—great God! how late the thought—by one word—one precious thought, dull brain hadst thou not been as dead, ere this how much misery —what fruitless length of sorrow had been spared to me and mine;”—and as with increased speed he urged his associate on with the quick reflection of the moment, all the self delusion of his young nature gathered power and burst forth, accompanied with those hopes which had for a time laid dormant, checked by the untimely frost of despair —the blasted tree of life seemed renewed within him, and once again blossomed bright and exuberant, as it were nourished by the warm and secret fountain whose well-spring lay hidden in the recesses of his heart, like a flower that from the night and storm had but shrunk inward, and as awakened from a honied sleep it opens its bosom to the dew, and spreads around the perfumed fragrance its closed leaves had held as it rejoices in the reviving embrace of the sunbeam which it smiles to meet;—and yet nevertheless amid this glimpse of light, a distant cloud at times appeared at whose darkness when it crossed him a sensation of rage and terror stole involuntarily through him as though he gazed on the white crown of the basilisk, the breath of whose vapour is pregnant with death, and at the black idea, it took a moment's resolution to regain his self possession; he had endured the very extremity of anguish as his evil fortune, he had truly breasted wretchedness and despair, he had drank of a draught as bitter as the juice of the chamfered aloe leaf—the fearful tenor of his fate could not be augmented in sorrow, it had been but for him to smile at fresh malice from ungenerous fortune, and he deemed he had been wound to that pitch of frenzied bravery that the evil fate might heap on him, if it destroyed, was welcome, and he would meet it withal as the worn out and starved wretch who clings to the scatterling of the wreck, as he awaits death greets the gathering of the travado whose coming wings are to whelm him in destruction—but this it seemed he scarce could bend his spirit to perform, to pursue to its perfection the plan he had now adopted of seeing Sloughter, he must perforce, in lowly guise, a suppliant and humble beggar at the knee of power, cross the threshold of the proud residence of the inveterate Bayard, the foeman of his house. The idea made his high heart swell within him, while every limb trembled with agitation, at the very mention of the man whose dark complottings had been so fatal to the name of Leisler; and this, when breathed from the lips of others, though ever present in his own breast, herded up with a deep and seated trust for retribution, made his eye flash, and flushed his cheek to fever; in truth, strong was his reluctance to place a foot towards the dwelling, that owned as master the deadliest enemy of his father's life, even to seek its preservation. It was hard to see the triumphant splendours of him whose untiring hate had brought his unfortunate parent to the degradation, and the chains he now bore and suffered, and to whose never to be sated malice, most possibly, his blood was to be shed as an oblation. Indeed Arnyte could not at times, in this train of thought, disguise from himself that it were not unlikely that should chance usher him in the presence of that man, that, did not fortune prevail as wont in Bayard's favour, and his arm was not unwithered, though he fell for the deed, that the years of Bayard would not save him from his fury; and it was with difficulty, and the remembrance of the consequence that might ensue to his father from so wild an attempt, that he could quell his rebel feelings, which at some moments wanted but the sight of his enemy to have arisen to very madness. The need—the safety of his father, prevailed—and he determined at length to forbear all, and creep, for his sake, were it demanded, to the dust that Bayard shook from his feet, so it led to Sloughter's presence—so it assisted in preserving from the axe, the venerated head of Jacobus Leisler. A few minutes brisk walking, brought the ensign and Arnyte to a noble and lordly avenue, on each side of which rose a row of the lofty acacias, and here and there in the line towered a mighty poplar, which, straight, bare and limbless, was like the tall mast of some gallant vessel. Having entered the avenue, and followed the course it led for a considerable distance, the country rising higher from the river, whose sight they had sometime left behind, as they went along, passing small forests of huge pine trees and hemlocks, through which the path was carefully cut, and ever and anon, some wide field, which bore the trace of clearance and culture, and which in the summer, perhaps, glowed with rich burdens of rye or wheat, they came at length to a neat gateway, that opening on a large space of ground, in which here and there was scattered an ancient sycamore, that fronted the homestead of Nicholas Bayard—a large, and somewhat imposing mansion, in which the Dutch and English architecture and material was not unadvantageously blended. The building was one of that class of mansions, introduced early after the conquest of the English on the island of Manahadoes, as the country residences of the wealthy. Here and there, still remains in the vicinity of the city, a solitary remnant of these dwellings, with its wide porticoes, and massy balustrades and huge halls, though their stable and century enduring foundations are fast rooting up, to make way for the more flimsy, yet fashionable villas of the upstart and fantastic crowd, who disdain the homes of the gentry of the olden day, which look as men who have outlived their time—whose comates are withering in the grave, while they endure, lonely and neglected, and worn with age, and move among the throng of the young and the gay, that have, as in an hour, sprung up around them, filling the places of departed friends, with cold and scornful looks, like melancholy spectres of departed time. A soldier of the adelborst, with arms folded, supporting his musquetoon, paced slowly backwards and forwards in front of the house, announcing by his guard of honour, that the mansion was the temporary residence of the governor and commander in chief of the province of New-Yorke. As the ensign and Arnyte approached the dwelling, the soldier halted in his march, and fronted their advance—and having drawn his pipe from his mouth, with the luxury of which he appeared to be wiling away the hour of duty, he for a moment stared at them as they neared his post, with a suspicious survey, ere, in a stern voice, he demanded their business, and whom they wanted. To his questions, Jost Stoll eagerly, and somewhat authoritatively, answered, that he wished to see his excellency the governor—at the hearing of which, instead of making way for him to pass, as the ensign expected, the soldier, with an insulting and insolent air and expression, laughing in mockery at his ragged attire, bade him keep off and depart with his companion—stating that colonel Sloughter was not free to be seen by such vagabonds—and threatened, if they did not instantly retire, that he should fire his gun upon them—which, with bold audacity, he levelled, to put such purpose in execution. It was in vain they endeavoured to argue and prevail on the determination of the man—he was still obdurate—he laughed at their anger, and scorned their promises and persuasions, and, but for the lucky and unexpected interference of an auxiliary, they would have been forced to commit violence, to have passed the fellow, or have given over as fruitless the attempt. The person who came to their assistance, was a brisk looking little old woman, who advanced from the door of the mansion, apparently attracted by the noise and voices of the contending parties. The clamorous outrage of the soldier was in an instant stilled at the presence of this personage, as before a superior, while his opponents ceased their struggles in the curiosity of the moment, somewhat stricken with the singularity of the figure that was ushered before them—whose undulatory and multitudinous form, in breadth, size and shape, might have been compared with some truth to a Dutch fishing dogger—for though wanting in height, the dame lacked nothing in breadth, being as squab as a barrel—and to her vast expansion of body, her dress made a considerable addition—for her hips protruded plainly from the compass of her voluminous attire, their swelling shape increased by monstrous quiltings and gatherings of dress, which were puckered up in numerous folds at her side, 26* A snow white mob cap, stiff and starched, with streaming ribands and pointed lace, covered her head—her ears were decorated with old fashioned golden ear-rings, which depended down to her broad shoulders, and round her neck she had a double string of beads, of yellow amber, each one as large as a ripe cherry; about her waist and shoulders, though low in the neck, she had a kind of jacket of black velvet, worked with many coloured silks, in flowers, and decorated with rows of multitudinous little silver buttons, fastening in front with a huge stomacher, and lacings above it, with bars and crossings of gilt fillagree, and edgings of Flemish lace; her gown, or rather petticoat, was of a stout woollen stuff, coloured with alternate lines of red and blue, and short enough to exhibit to advantage her warm knit, yarn stockings, with their enormous yellow clocks; and her substantial feet were comfortably encased in a strong pair of shoes of lackered leather, with polished buckles. Every thing about the dame's attire and appearance, was neat, tidy and notable, and well comported with the dignity of her station as housekeeper to colonel Nicholas Bayard; and indeed of the authority derived from such situation, she was not a little proud, nor was she one who was accustomed to leniency in the exercise of such sway as she attained therefrom. No—in sober truth, frau Hyletje was one of that sort who wait not with deference to the opinion of others, to set a true value on themselves; and the good dame, though a short woman, in earnest, was accustomed to hold her head mighty high; nathless, vulgar sneers,—but these she set down as from the source they came, the jealousy of the canaille, or `konolye,' as she termed them, with ineffable scorn. “Why, mensch Peterkin,” said the dame to the soldier, “what in the name of wonder, is this clatter? who and what are these, mensch Peterkin?” pursued the frauw directing a sharp scrutiny towards the ensign and Arnyte, and somewhat disappointed by the unfavourable plight of the graphist's garments, “we can't have any konolye about the house, mensch Peterkin.” “I have forbid them the grounds, frau Hyletje,” returned the alderbost respectfully, “but they care not for civil words, and I am driven to force to learn them manners.” “Ay, mensch Peterkin, the konolye never know their distance,” quoth the dame in return, “yet, mensch Peterkin, it is not respectful before our doors, when his honour and excellency dignifies the house with his presence and visit,—it is not respectful, I say, as the tailor said to his needle, when it pricked his thumb instead of the cloth, that the entrance of a domicile of a respectable burgher, should be disgraced by the clamour of konolye—yet what can be expected from such persons, as the goose said to the gander, when the ducks eat up all the corn. I say, mensch Peterkin, this does not become a decent and reputable family like ours, mensch Peterkin!—And yet,” said the dame, somewhat mollified in her precise and lofty notions, by the attractive appearance of young Leisler, “the look of the younker is not altogether so coarse, as the miller said to the grain, when the wheel cracked and refused to grind. What's your name and wish, Mienheer?—an't your name Schermerhorne? I never saw such a likeness as there is about your eyes, to the Schermerhorne family at Schenectadie; the colour of your hair is just theirs, as the cat said to the kitten, when she told her of the rat. In the name of wonder, you must be Douw Schermerhorne—that is, little Douw—he is the youngest of all the Schermerhornes. Why child, how you've grown, as the crab said to the mushroom. How's aunt Elbertje? is sister Janetje married yet? what's become of her old spark, Gardt Van Wee? you don't know I am a relation to the Schermerhornes. I'll tell you all about it, as the salmon said to the flounder, after she had escaped the hook with the bait. My second cousin, Winant Van Zandt, married the sister of Bolee Van Wagenen, who was the step daughter of Ostheim Van Dolen—no konolye, I can let you know—but ugh! ugh!”— The frau had got this length in her dissertation, when a fit of coughing seized her, and gave a moment's respite to her hearers, who, from her positive and rapid manner of utterance, were not able either to explain themselves to her, or even get in a word edgeways, she having the whole field to herself. With more success than heretofore, Arnyte seized the opportunity, and freely discovered his name and situation, and his desire and object in seeing the governor; and although a retainer of his enemy, he besought the dame's compassion to afford him a chance to save his father's life, by an interview with colonel Sloughter. Frau Hyletje was somewhat startled at this appeal, and although apparently fearful and indecisive, her feelings were evidently enlisted in favour of the stripling, whose suit was warmly backed by his anxious companion. “By mine halidome,” quoth the generous hearted ensign, “though this grumbling watch-dog growls at me now, and forgets that like me, the great Salvator must have made a ragged subject, when he left the Apulian robbers—an I see Hal Sloughter, by mine troth, I'll make him change his tints—and 'faith, fair dame, an you conduct us to him, I'll paint your picture—you'll make a noble head, and shall vie with Titian's daughter, Rembrandt's wife, and D'Urbino's mistress.” “You're one of the Leisler family,” said frau Hyletje in reply to Arnyte, “what a pretty set of konolye you've all made of yourselves—a fine stew your father has put the province in, as the cook said to the frying-pan—you are the youngest an't you—your father has had but two children has he—a girl, she married Jacobus Milbourne, and a boy that's you an't it—why you are the image of your mother—you look as like as two peas, as the farmer said to his pigs—only to think now how you have grown out one's recollection—why I was at your christening—it seems like yesterday—and a rare frolic there was—the waits played before your father's door all night, and the slaves beat the bonjo lustily the whole day—and then what a feast there was, it done one good only to look at it, as the fox said to the chickens when he found the wall too high for him to leap—why your mother was one of the Van Alstynes—a reputable family—no konolye among them—they belonged to Poghkeepsing and were some way connected to the Livingstons of the manor—well you have got into a sad dish, as the scullion said to his mate when the cat ran away with the meats, and you need not tell me your story child, I know all about it— bad enough it is in all conscience—your father's just sure to be hanged child, so take comfort, for such things can't be helped, as the doctor said to the sick man, when he found he would die in spite of his medicine, what can't be cured must be endured, is a wise saw that you must take profit by—so take comfort child—take comfort:”—and the garralous dame indulged herself in this desultory gossip, unmeaningly wounding where she thought to succour her hearers, who found it in vain to breast the torrent of her words, and it was not literally until her breath gave out for the time that Arnyte was able again to exert himself to interest her in affording him facility towards attaining the object at which he was now bent—at last with some difficulty he gained her consent, though she observed when expressing it, her fears that she was acting unadvisedly to introduce him to the chamber of the governor. “But Colonel Sloughter is a fine man—a real gentleman, nothing konolye about him whatever,” said the dame, as she led them in the house, “there's something one can see at once about a true cavalier and a great man, as the crab said to the whale—why there's no more pretension about his excellence than there is about me—he talks as familiar to me as if we had known each other for years, let alone he is their majesties' governor general of the province—but then there's some inducement to his honor's condescension towards me—there never was any thing konolye about me or mine—which is more than many people can say—no Larry Van Schawachofer of the Brill who was my great grandfather was a reputable burgher as any in the Vaderlandts, gainsay him who may, and then let the worst come to the worst, as the butcher said to the ox when he snapt the rope that bound him, if my giving you any means of access to his honor should anger his excellence or Mienheer Bayard—though child I can't see the harm in it, as the monkey said to the looking-glass—and it's no more than right you should strive for your father, as bad a man as Jacobus Leisler is, and as much as he deserves to be hung child—for though—take comfort child—I assure you I have no hopes of your success in saving Mienheer Leisler—for though I say, you do not save him child—and I get in trouble by doing what I do, as the thief said to his booty when he robbed its owner—yet child I will have some consolation in knowing I assisted you in your afflictions, and poor infirm creatures like we mortals are, child, as the dominie said, should—You'll find his excellence in that chamber child—be of good heart—though I am certain it's of no use your trying, you can't possibly succeed, as the frying-pan said to the eel as he strove to leap out—I leave you here at the door, you'll find his honor very sociable—there's nothing konoyle about him child.” Frau Hyletje, after entering the door of the mansion, preceded Arnyte and Jost Stoll to the upper end of a huge and low roofed hall, whose sides and pannels of dark oak, gave it a sombre and gloomy aspect; there she abruptly paused at the half opened entrance of a room, in which, as her speech had indicated, Colonel Sloughter was to be found, and with that which she deemed words of assurance at parting, she hastily left them to make such way themselves across the threshold of the Governor's apartment as they were best able,—and it appeared as if in the very accomplishment of her kind action towards Arnyte, by her fearful and precipitate manner of departure, that fran Hyletje, in spite of her words, repented and failed in heart as she approached near to the personage whose anger her officiousness in introducing unwished for suitors, as might be supposed, would arouse, and the tenor of her speech did not disguise from her hearers her timidity on this point so as to induce them to care to arrest her retreating steps. The advantage of the situation where they were left by frau Hyletje, and the partly unclosed door of the apartment, discovered to Arnyte and his companion the interior and its inmates, by whom they were as yet unnoticed and unperceived in the earnestness of their engagement. The room was an old fashioned, low locust wainscoted chamber, with heavy shelved fire place, dark and polished with outpourings of the smoke, the hearth and chimney jambs were of decorated and ingeniously inlaid Dutch-china tiles, on whose visage the brightness of the fire glittered sparklingly, and the shooting and brilliant flame was reflected as on the surface of a mirror; above the fire place hung black, soiled and scarce distinguishable from age, neglect, and the ascending vapours of the smoke, a painting of the Flemish school, which instantly attracted the eye of Jost Stoll, whose whole attention was enwrapt in its examination the moment it caught his sight, so as to be utterly regardless, as wont, of time, place, or situation, and every object about him,—the apartment otherwise was rather cumberously than sumptuously furnished: huge satyr legged tables, monstrous chairs, with damask cushions and feet of lions' claws, and other articles equally unwieldy and sumptuously ornamented, the glass and picture frames being formed by twisted ribbons, serpents, rose stalks, leaves, and flowers, all entwining in gilt, according to the taste of the time; indeed, the house of Mynheer Bayard, and its internal arrangement and decorations assorted much with his political feelings, having less traces of the Dutch than assimilation towards the innovation of the fashions of the English aristocracy of the time, as far as the intercouse and means of importation of their splendour would permit the distant colonist to enjoy. Sloughter, somewhat neglectfully attired, with looks flushed and disturbed, was standing by a table, over which bundles of parchment and papers were carelessly strewn, while Nicholas Bayard, his host, was at his side, holding in his hand a roll of vellum, and apparently earnestly addressing the Governor, who seemed to listen to his words peevish and impatient; the broken sentence which struck the ear of Arnyte as he advanced to enter the chamber, thrilled through him, and made him pause for the instant with breathless solicitude to listen to their converse. “But Colonel Sloughter,” Bayard was saying, as in conclusion of what might have been an expostulation and argument to enforce the Governor's performance of that which he was in some wise averse, and using in his manner of speech that candour of utterance and argument as if from the lips of friendship, to induce Sloughter's compliance with the matter, “but Colonel Sloughter,” quoth Nicholas Bayard, “the Council have already negatived the frivolous plea of the criminal; the court hath passed sentence of death, such as the law hath dictated to them; the warrant for his execution hath been drawn out—I hold it in my hand—You cannot, permit me, Sir, to remind you, refuse that which is your duty, and perfect by your signature this instrument which seals the peace of this province! What, Sir, will the world, the people say to this strange aversion to fulfil the sentence of the law? the court hath decided, the Council have accorded that he hath done the deed of a rebel and a traitor, and must die the death—” “Let me tell you Colonel Bayard,” suddenly interrupted Sloughter, and pacing the room with an abrupt step and irritated air—“by mine honour let me tell you Colonel Bayard, I am no boy to be led in leading strings, by the Council or Court, or by living man—you have been over zealous Sir, over hasty in this matter—you have taken me unawares Sir,—I had no idea that things had been hurried to this last stage;—that I feel hostile, yea, condemn this man Leisler—that he deserves punishment, exemplary punishment, no man is more willing than I am to accord—but I will not be dictated to, this looks like dictation; all here hath been too precipitate—last night the trial, and at its heels, within an hour, the Council awards its sanction—that scarce breathed, ere I am demanded to sign the warrant for the execution of a severe and desolating sentence, a sentence which once put in force, there can come no after repentance;—Colonel Bayard I am a soldier, and have in the heat of contest, in the fiery throng of battle seen gore—life gore run like water—but albeit I must confess I shudder at taking a man's existence,—at quenching in cool blood the lamp of life—nathless your forms and trickeries of law—without first having good and mature consideration on the step ere I take it;—I do also remember me Colonel Bayard my own life within a day was in the hands of others, I therefore lack not feeling for a sufferer, albeit different in situation, though like exposed—I will not be rash Sir, there shall be no speedy work, things shall be reflected on—and as for the people Sir,—what are the people, you yourself have decried them—beasts of burthen, hounds that must obey the beck of their masters; they shall not dictate, Colonel Bayard, my course, I am sufficient judge I hope of right or wrong without their gainsay.” “Your exellencie most assurely looketh on the business erroneously,” returned Bayard in a soothing tone of voice, “it hath never been the part, act, or intention of the court that tried Jacobus Leisler—or your faithful counsel in performing the severe duty assigned them in the same—nor, speaking honestly Colonel Sloughter hath it been, or is it the design of Nicholas Bayard your firm well wisher to point out for ill, or enforce your adoption of any course—this we leave most respectfully to your better judgment—but that it well becomes us, our stations, our allegiance to their sacred majesties as most dutiful and loyal subjects, who, in our hearts, abhor and detest all the rebellious, arbitrary, and illegal proceedings of the late usurpers of their majesties' authority over this province; who, from the bottom of our hearts, I repeat, with all integrity acknowledge and declare that there are none that can or ought to have right to rule or govern their majesties' subjects here in New-Yorke, but by their majesties' proper commission and authority, which is now placed in your excellency. Under these pure feelings, we are enspirited to advise, to suggest, and I will assert it, Colonel Sloughter, to urge that which we in faith believe is sound policy, and best conducive to the conservation of the tranquillity of the inhabitants of this colony; and if, I say, your excellency, any of us, in the pursuance of this laudable endeavour, have been too pertinacious, or rather frankly speaking, for that way I interpret your words, Colonel Sloughter,—if the honest and anxious zeal of Nicholas Bayard hath been miscontrued, and from my exertions for the public weal, unfavourable impressions have visited your excellency's mind, I do make bold to say that my earnest desire, my strenuous wish for your excellency's welfare, and of their majesties' dominions in Vol. II. 27 America, hath alone been the cause, these have o'erleapt discretion—a plain man like me, your excellency, knows not the art to control his honest feelings; for I will not disguise it, Sir, the death of Jacobus Leisler is, in my poor opinion, sought at your hands an expiatory offering, not alone to the magnitude of his crime, but at once as a terrible ensample to his secret and unsubdued partizans, who remain hidden in the core of the multitude, and moreover, to the wishes, hopes, and offended feelings of the well affected, and this must be immediate: for permit me to remind you, that delays breed obstacles as well as dangers, which, to one who so well knows the fickle nature of the people with whom you have to deal as I do, and of whose violence and madness of excitement in the massacre of the traitor Milbourne, your excellency hath a stern specimen,—may ground some fears that, an public justice be not straightforth satisfied, disturbances, that will give no slight trouble to quell, may arise; and your excellency's knowledge of mankind, I doubt not, hath taught you ere now, that in such times of civil commotion, the lives, properties, nay, sir, both friend and foe are at peril. I beseech your excellency to pause and reflect on the convulsed state of this province, ere, by an undue leniency, or may I without offence so term it, for want of an instantaneous firmness of action, the unhappy citizens of New-Yorke are thrown back into that terrific state of disorder, wherefrom, I was flattering myself, the benignant presence of your excellency was extricating them.” To the first part of this exhortation of Bayard, the Governor listened fretfully and unwillingly, as one who hears an argument which is at discord with his own opinions; but ere the speaker had finished, his uneasy air and broken gait, as he measured the length of the apartment with pensive strides, marked the force of the impressions which he received from the insidious foeman of the suffering Leisler—Sloughter heard his counsellor through, and then stood with hand raised to his thoughtful brow, motionless and silent for a time, while Bayard, as if he read the conflict of his mind, with a keen yet exulting look regarded his deliberations. “Colonel Bayard, it is not for me to deny that what you advance is not of moment,” said the Governor at length, though the hesitation and decision of his mind were perceptible in his manner, “yet, my friend, I cannot rid me of an inclination to delay the last and violent step you advise; it certainly doth strike me at once as dangerous as well as impolitic, and these promptings I have not the resolution to subdue, to cut off a man, who like Leisler, (for this, nathless later misdeeds, must be allowed him in all praise,) hath so vigorously and early appeared for William of Orange, and whose conduct hath so signally contributed to the revolution; and I would have you remember, I have others besides the people of this province to account to for my actions—I have doubts, sir, how a deed of so bloody a cast as that suggested will be received at Whitehall.” “In my poor judgment, what your excellency hath thrown out, though natural, are unfounded fears, if without offence I may apply the term on the matter in question,” eagerly responded Nicholas Bayard, perceiving the advantage he was fast gaining over the wavering mind of the governor, “and I think the least reflection on the part of one, whose discrimination is usually so just and clear on most subjects, will at once convince your excellency's latent doubts that what I argue is strictly right and unanswerable. I apprehend, that whatever hesitation your excellency labours under, on such points as your excellency has been pleased to mention, can be satisfied; for let me ask your excellency, whether a man, who having preserved another from death, murthers afterwards the object of such charity, deserves or ought to escape the liability of the law for the life he takes, forsooth, because at first, at imminent hazards, he saved that very life which later he destroys; again, I would seek at your excellency what favour of gratitude doth one deserve who having bestowed inadvertently a great benefit on his fellow, no sooner discovers its worth, than he robs him thereof—is not this Leisler's case? but I will go on and put the fact to conviction: what doth he merit, who, for his own ambition strikes off the shackles with which a tyrant binds his serfs, and who no sooner hath attained his conquest than he seeks, base born as he is, to fill that fallen tyrant's place? Yes, your excellency, what hath Leisler done but enacted the part of a faithful subject that he might the better play the rebel and the traitor? shall a man who commits a crime, for the deceptive and superficial show of a former day, escape legal punishment? Shall a highwayman plead that in the days of his virtue he gave charity? Your excellency's good sense (with due submission) must coincide with my assertion, that such a criminal should be an ensample to the world, to show how just the punishment for an aberration from virtue—but the actions of Jacobus Leisler have not been such as to offer themselves in mitigation of his sentence—your excellency, the province is convinced of the magnitude of his guilt, and the righteousness of a severe and exemplary punishment—and as for the feelings at Court—as for the reception of his death at Whitehall—what friends—what mourners can a convicted traitor—a hardened rebel have in the hallowed circle of their sacred majesties—God keep all such from their presence—besides, can any one be averse to the true administration of justice—can any man regret or be offended at the sentence of a just and impartial Court— no your excellency, the traitor Jacobus Leisler has been condemned by the law of the land, and whatever blame should come, must fall on that law—you made it not— neither did you try the criminal—but you fulfil by signing his death-warrant, the high and imperious dictates that the law hath awarded your station; I am bold to say it Sir, you fulfil your duty only by the act—your excellency may as well refuse the death of a robber, a pirate, a murtherer, as to stand between the appointed sentence of the law and a convicted traitor.” The irresolution of Governor Sloughter sank before the forceful earnestness and perseverance of the cold hearted Bayard, he unfolded slowly his arms, and raised his head from the meditative posture in which it had reclined on his breast, and there was a slight and tremulous movement of his under lip as he compressed it inward, and his brows contracted themselves in the sternness of determination, as his reluctance momently gave way and yielded to the warmth of representation by which he was pressed—the weakness of Colonel Sloughter was evident, and well did the wily Bayard know the chord of mastery to work on—for while he paraded forth his respect and submission, he in fact governed him whose commands he appeared to worship as a servile slave: for at the same time by the guileful manner wherewith he pronounced his sentiments and enforced his arguments for Leisler's execution, he flattered the selfish pride of a vain man—quick, irritable and alive to that he deemed detractive either to his independence of opinion or authority—as in the advancement of his reasons he seemed alone to appeal to the sagacity and discretion of him whom he addressed, as if in the perception of each fact he used, the hearer had preceded the speaker, and as from that which he asserted common sense and experience could not deteriorate—he also lulled in slumber all the political apprehensions of personal consequences which deterred the accedence of the governor to the act he sought his completion—and moreover by a cunning show of disinterested honesty—an ardent desire for the welfare as well as the credit of his government, to which the most imbecile ruler is awake; he finally succeeded in bending Colonel Sloughter to his will—thus it is that the credulous, unwary, and weak minded when they least suspect it, when most boastful of their freedom are in the thraldom, and dwindle down into the passive tool of vile and designing knaves—and by surrendering heedlessly, and without due caution the impulses of their own generous hearts to the fine spun sophistry invented for their deception; from their characters or stations the opprobrium of villanies, whose benefit they reap not fall on their heads, while their directors and advisers covered and in secret escape pursuit, and banquet on the spoil, to gain which they have dared no danger—receiving the advantages of another's blinded 27* folly—Bayard eagerly snatched a pen from the standish that stood near, and thrusting it with an air that even controlled as it was by policy and art, bespoke anticipated trumph, and interest in the event of a personal nature, in the pliant hand of the governor which had been partially lifted to receive it, he officiously unrolled the warrant and spread it out before Colonel Sloughter to receive his signature. “Colonel Bayard, I owe this man Leisler, however affected by his imprudence, no animosity; I am moved by no resentment of a personal nature whatever. In placing my name to the warrant for his execution, I would have it understood, I perform an act rendered necessary, by the event of his trial. It is an approval of the court I can neither avoid nor withhold, as being honoured by their majesties' commission over this province; and albeit, I can find no room for the exercise of mercy, considering the enormity of guilt committed by the unfortunate wretch—for his crime hath truly placed his blood on his own head.” As the governor expressed these words, he approached the open warrant, and leaned over it as about to commence the writing, which was to seal for ever the fate of his fallen predecessor. “Hold, colonel Sloughter, an instant, forbear the fearful deed that takes his life—while thus clasping your knees, I supplicate you to spare my father.” And as he spoke, Arnyte rushed breathless into the apartment, and cast himself at the governor's feet. “By mine halidome, that is by an old master,—I'll wager it is from the brush of Huysum,—I know it by the stiffness of his grouping,” exclaimed Jost Stoll, as he followed the steps of young Leisler, his attention evidently as much rivetted to the picture, which had first engaged his sight, as either by the presence of the governor, or that which was stirring in the scene, “troth, your excellence, I greet ye from my heart:—by the by, who painted that? the figures are not bad—a little rough, though—by the glory of Sir Godfrey, there are no mean touches about the piece.” “Heaven and earth! what do I behold—my brave deliverer—ensign Jost Stoll alive—are miracles rife?” ejaculated the governor simultaneously with their entrance. Language can scarce realize the startled and amazed looks of the inmates of that room, at this most unexpected and undreamed of interruption, at a moment so interesting and important, and when to the accordance of the wishes of his political foeman, the blood of Leisler was about to be yielded irrevocably. Marvel and ire were blended in the visage and action of Bayard, whose every feature scowled in malignancy, at the intrusion. The unused pen dropped from the palsied fingers of Sloughter, as he turned his eyes on the youth and his companion in alternate wonder and alarm, gazing on each, as in the lapses of a vision, while his eye ran over their persons as one that scans a thing, scarce reconciled to the mind as real, or as beings given up from the grave or dropped from some bursting of a stormy cloud;—an instant's glance served for recognition—but the governor's gaze rested last and longest, reverting from the well known countenance of the ensign, which it had met pleased and astonished, to the haggard and care worn lineaments of the stripling—while the attitude in which the youth had prostrated himself in humbleness and misery, had his words, his piercing and grief-like tones, been unheard, could not be misconstrued; they struck to the soul of Sloughter—they shot in his ears like bolts of burning iron, and for the moment's breath, his blood flowed backward to his heart, leaving him pale as death, and then, sudden as their retreat, the hot fountains of his veins swelled upwards to his crimsoned cheeks. “What, thou the son of Leisler—doth sense or hearing mock me?” muttered he in a faint accent of surprise and agitation, and he paused for a moment, like one who strives to recover from the stunning force of a thunder shock, ere he continued—“brave and noble youth,” pursued he, “this should not be—it doth shame me greatly, to see thee thus:—it is not for him who saved my life, at my knee thus in lowliness to seek his suit; come, my preserver, to my bosom—the place next to my heart, thou deservest to fill—to my arms, sir— prithee, rise to my heart!” And with a caress of kindness, he endeavoured to lift the stripling from his humble posture.” “Nay, nay, your excellency doth yourself wrong,” quoth Arnyte, repelling his attempt with animation, “I come not here your creditor nor your equal—but as the son of a condemned man; I am the wretched child of the forlorn and unfortunate Jacobus Leisler; of him, whose miserable destruction you were but now about to consummate; by all that earth and heaven holds sacred, I do conjure, implore and pray you, not to sign, not to touch that horrid and bloody instrument—for God's sake, sign it not, but spare, oh, spare the life of my poor father.” And as he spoke, he clung to the governor in the wild agony of passionate entreaty, while his eyes, with a tearful and piteous expression of pleading, were raised to the countenance of Sloughter, who, undetermined, yet shaken, listened to the beseechings of the stripling, his aspect disturbed, and his frame trembling with palpable emotion. Bayard having rallied his amazement at young Leisler's presence, and harassed with fearful forebodings as to its evident effect on Sloughter, in which he already beheld the downfal and disappointment of his hopes, now advanced, and prepared to interpose himself before the influence of the petitioner. “Young man,” quoth he, with affected feeling, placing as he spoke, his hand gently on the youth's shoulder, as with intent to assist him in kindness from his suppliant position, “your own sense must make you aware how unavailing under the present circumstances, is this conduct; you are exhausting your strength and nerves to no purport whatever, except at once cruelly lacerating and rending the tender heart of his excellency. I speak for him, Mienheer Leisler—I would wish to spare him the regret and sorrow of denial to you, to whom he acknowledges such obligation; he hath the sympathy of a man for your situation; his heart, as you cannot but be convinced of, bleeds for you at every pore; but stern needcessity—the duty enjoined on him—the high place which he fills, hath made him the dispenser of the law—and it behooves not to commingle therewith, ought personal—and were it his own, nathless your father, he could not—nay boy, he dare not for his conscience—for his honor's sake —grant more than his commiseration for the unhappy man. The voice of Bayard was nervous and emphatic in its tone, and with a stern and meaning look as he uttered his words he perused the features of the Governor, wherein were painted the conflicting struggles of his soul, paramount in which his failing resolution could be read— Sloughter seemed to shrink before the fixed gaze of Bayard as conscious of his weakness, and almost like a school-boy humbled before the haughty frown of his domineering preceptor; he noted the latter sentence uttered by Bayard, who plainly by his manner appeared rather as if he addressed them to Colonel Sloughter's attention than to the stripling. When Arnyte felt the touch of the mortal foe of his name, his very flesh seemed to quiver and shrunk from the grasp, as if the hand whose weight was on him bore contagion to his blood; while his cheek grew to a livid hue, and he drew his breath long, heavily, and thick between his clenched teeth, and his eyes sparkled in deep rage as he scanned the living lineaments of rooted hate; “I asked not of thee, Colonel Bayard, to back my suit,” retorted the youth, quickly turning on the unwelcome and unfriendly intermeddler; his voice sharp with sarcastic anger, and his fiery spirit darting from his speaking visage as it would have withered his adversary; “a son of the house of Leisler could expect no favour from such as thee, it might as well be demanded of the treacherous tiger to surrender from the gripe of his merciless jaws the fresh slain victim, ere he had glutted his ruthless appetite on a drop of the gore; or the fierce and ravenous vulture to yield a morsel of the flesh that its beak hath stripped from the carcass of the dead, as to suppose that Nicholas Bayard would aid in preserving the life of Jacobus Leisler: no, Mienheer” continued Arnyte severely, “the rather when the scaffold is prepared, be you ready at hand with axe and cord, lest the stout heart of the executioner fail him in that awful hour of need, and that you may make your work sure—” Arnyte paused awhile as he me with calm and bold front the grim smile of unutterable malice that passed over the face of his opponent, as he relaxed the hold he had taken upon the garment of the youth—Bayard drew himself back with high and lofty motion, while his eye lowered in dark, quenchless, and insatiate ire upon the offender, like the arrowy fire of a gloomy cloud that darts from the black and stormy heaven towards the palaces of earth as eager for destruction. “Nay Colonel Bayard it is not meet that you restrain Mienheer Leisler,” quoth the Governor, “it surely becomes me to hear the young man ere I decide on his application, or his father's death, it is just, it is fair, Colonel Bayard!” Bayard answered only with a bitter sneer, and Arnyte turned towards the Governor: “Be ye not deaf of ear and of heart, and ye will hear me with compassion,” he said, the high tone wherewith he had attacked Bayard changing to one of almost womanish lamentation, “yes, it is thy feet Colonel Sloughter I embrace—it is to you I lift my hands in suppliance in affliction, for thou hast the power and can save him,” and he clasped his hands in the strenuousness of his solicitation, “spare, oh spare” he wildly cried, “my father's life!”— The Governor in silence covered his face to conceal his agitation: “Spare the life of Jacobus Leisler,” the youth continued, “I ask it at your hands, not by the memory of such services as I may have rendered you in extremity —not by the blood which as water I would have poured out to shield you from the poniard of the assassin—but I seek it from your mercy, from your humanity—whatever have been his crimes for which he deserves to suffer, though a parent is never guilty in the eyes of his child, yet far be it from me now to dispute them—yet, oh I entreat let not his evil deeds be heard, blot them out from the calendar of his days and spare him—I beg it of you by the love you have borne to the protectors of your own infancy—by your regard for your own parents in days gone by—by the thousand ties that bound you to them while living—by your reverence for them in death—by the dust of their graves—I pray you spare him, he is my parent; make not our home a place of desolation, widow not my mother, have mercy on him who now begs it from you—oh! you have never had the heart of a son an you refuse me, an you deny, you never could have received or known the fond and tender blandishments, the multitudinous cares that link the parent and his offspring, or you could not hear in vain the voice of a son who pleads for his father's life—oh! there is a sacredness in the very name of a parent, that will make it sacrilege to harm a single hair of his revered head—oh! forbear, forbear the horrid death you have marked out for him: let him not die the death of infamy; expose him not to the heartless scorn of an infuriated rabble, who will but mock his agonies—your heartstrings must be insensible and bloodless, your eyes stone an they can look on the suffering ye have doomed him to, and not be blasted; bethink you yet but a little while, a few circling years death will claim his own, the sorrows he hath seen will bow him to the grave—cut not short by violence his brief span of years, and far from this land of wo in poverty, in exile, our prayers, our blessings shall stream up in incense to thee—oh! spare him, spare him from the scaffold;—it is hard to endure the thought of parting, when the course of age in its infirmity brings the hoary headed man unto the last resting place of mortality—but that death of blood and crime—that fearful death—it will madden me —oh God have mercy—oh spare his precious life!—I call on you Colonel Sloughter by your solemn promise in the hour of gratitude—plighted in the sight of heaven and of earth—the words are wrought on my heart—remember that pledge—when you refused what I might ask, though it were that which you might not well do—yet if you refused it, you called on the face of heaven which had then so smiled upon you, to be turned for ever from your fortunes—I ask the life of Jacobus Leisler at your lips—spare, oh spare my father's life!” Sloughter could no longer suppress the emotion that shook his frame in violence, beyond all caution;-prudence, former determination, and every feeling of hereafter consequence, were lost in the sight of the suppliant before him. “He shall not die! he shall not die!” exclaimed the Governor, in an almost involuntary ejaculation. This annunciation struck Arnyte with an almost electric power—it came on his ear with a stunning force—he heard the words that proclaimed safety to his father at first in breathless amazement, as if he could scarce be assured of the reality of the sound, even while he listened, or as though he had not understood that which had been said; nor when the lips of the Governor closed was his stupor broken; for he stirred not eye nor limb, and he stood for the time as one frozen in an attitude of attention; yet this lasted not, for suddenly his eyes rolled in wild exultation, and with a passionate burst of joy, he struggled to press the hand of the governor to his quivering lips. “Thou hast said it!” he cried, rejoicingly, “he shall not die! he shall not die!” The strength of the stripling, exhausted by repeated exertions, could support him no longer; for the sudden fulfilment of hope,—the reception of good and evil are oftentimes attended with similar effects, and madness hath been caused by both, so nearly allied are the emotions of happiness and sorrow;—all that had upheld Arnyte in the misery he had passed through, now apparently deserted him with the abrupt turn of fortune, and as he uttered the last words in a strain of almost incoherent rapture, he contended for an instant against the excess of agitation which seemed nearly to choak him; but his endeavour was fruitless, and a wild and hysteric passion of tears and of laughter, started from his lips, ere he dropt down at the feet of Sloughter in a paroxysm of death-like insensibility. Help! Colonel Bayard, Jost Stoll, help! for God's sake! the boy is dying! help to bear him in the air!” exclaimed the governor in alarm, as he dragged the senseless youth towards the window of the apartment. Bayard answered the call with slow and reluctant step, apparently unmoved by the fearful situation of young Leisler, and as though wishing the worst might happen ere his interference. Not so Jost Stoll; the Ensign, as he beheld the stripling fall to the earth, dashed from his hand the pencil that it held, and the now neglected death-warrant, which, in the mania of the moment, with utter indifference as to the consequence, and it would have been the same with a paper of even more importance, he had snatched up and was transferring on its surface, where there was a blank to be found, the leading traits of that which was passing before his eyes, with his usual exclamations of delight at the varied attitudes and passions of the living group he was drawing; an observer, unattended to by the more interested actors; but when he marked the fading colour of Arnyte's countenance, every other consideration vanished, and he threw from him all incumbrances, and rushed in haste to the stripling's assistance. Young Leisler was lifted forward between Jost Stoll and Colonel Sloughter, while Bayard, as loathing the object of their care, with slow hand, threw back the casement and admitted the breeze to enter the chamber freely; and while its refreshing coolness scattered his disordered locks upon his scarce throbbing temples, his supporters chafed his white and pallid brow, and rubbed to warmth his blood deserted hands. An interval of almost breathless expectation and incertitude passed, ere their utmost endeavours were able to recall a sign of reanimation, and they had nearly despaired of success in their anxious attempts, ere the reviving hue of life revisited and mingled its faint tinge on the colourless cheek of the stripling, and the first prognostication of returning consciousness, showed itself in a slight tremour that passed over his features;—and then followed and became perceptible a quick, short respiration, like that of a sleeping infant, while a faint spark of intelligence emanated through the shadows of his long dark eye lashes, whose Vol. II. 28 drooping lids slowly unclosed as from a dead sleep, and there broke a sudden, low, and scarce articulate sound, like the dying murmur of a distant echo, from his parted lips, which were fast empurpled with the rush of blood. “By mine halidome,” quoth Jost Stoll, his accustomed disposition again resuming its power in the assurance of the moment, as his fears, which had been strongly excited for the recovery of the youth, were somewhat relieved, and his anxiety for his safety diminished, as he felt sensibly the renewed beatings of Arnyte's heart against the pressure of his watchful hand, “By mine halidome,” said he, “much would I give, had I a pallet well assorted here, that I might catch the changes of his colour—gad, the tints would immortalize me; what an inimitable subject he would make for the Scripture piece of Elisha raising the widow's son from death—the life just returning to the before pallid cheek —the eye just opening—oh, he certainly would make a capital figure for the widow's son—what lovely, beautiful tints—they vie with the best ever laid out by the brush of Rubens.” “Where am I—where is my father?” murmured the youth, as he recovered from his faintness, “there seems a weight as if of clotted blood, upon my brain—where am I?” exclaimed Arnyte, as he glanced wildly around. He passed his hand rapidly across his brow, “ay, I remember it all, now—thou hast said thou wouldst spare my father's life—say I not right?” pursued he, “or can it be possible I have been in the frenzied delirium of fever, for the horrible confusion of a dream is on my brain —I pray you, mock me not with false comfort—thou hast surely said he shall not die.” “Be certain the life of Jacob Leisler is safe,” said colonel Sloughter, “I prithee calm thyself, your frame cannot bear these frantic paroxysms.” “Thank heaven! thank heaven, I heard right,” exclaimed Arnyte, “the words are true, he shall not die! Oh, God, the sound darts through my brain, and rushes on my heart—ha! ha! ha!—this agony of joy will madden me—he shall not die! he shall not die!” “I beg of you be composed,” said the governor. “Composed—calm—ay, I am composed—calm—and yet there is a tumult here within, that vies with the tempest driven ocean in its rage,” continued Arnyte, beating his bosom, “great God, how shall I express the wild rush of happiness, that fills every vein as with a flood? he shall not die! you have said my father shall live! ah, your excellency, can words ever express all this throbbing heart would declare to you, oh let me fall down at your feet, thus cling for ever, and pour out in one endless stream of weeping, as though the sluices of my eyes were rent, my never ceasing blessing—my untiring gratitude—but this is not for me alone—my whole race— yes, and chief of all he whose life you have spared, will join me in these thanks.” “Nay, nay, my good youth,” vainly interposed the governor. “Yes, your excellency, when you look on that aged man,” continued Arnyte, “when you see him to whom your word hath given life, free and breathing the air of heaven—when you hear him call down the choicest of blessings in the store of providence on his benefactor, then will you know the value of the gift you have extended to our afflictions—then will you know how the obligation is appreciated—but ah, he, my father, is not here; no, he still lingers in his darksome and solitary dungeon, nor knows the mercy that has been extended him; it shall be mine to bear him the gladsome tidings—ay, generous benefactor, at once I will wend me to that prison house, and he shall worship thy name.” “In truth, I fear me, noble boy, you are not equal to the task; your frame already weak and exhausted, will scarce bear such exertion and fatigue; you shall remain here, while I despatch a messenger to the Stadthuis, who will inform Jacobus Leisler, that for the son's sake, I have pardoned the father's errors.” “I will crave your excellence to bear with me,” replied Arnyte with ardour, “you know not the power, the strength, left in these limbs—they could accomplish more than may be supposed, in such a duty; bethink ye, too, of my father's wretched situation—his chains, and the insults heaped on him in that vile prison, and all that he momently suffers, even while I now linger. Who then so swift, so fit on such an errand of joy, as his son? others know not the worth of every instant; he whom your excellency's kindness might select, might be laggard; indifferent in feelings for the sad prisoner, he would not count the loss of time; he has no father to release, and cannot feel like me, how much it is to cheat the lot, the mourner's lot, of even a pang—no! though your excellency seems incredible of my boast—for it is true, but now, I gave way to weakness, yet believe me, my nerves are braced as iron, and my sinews seem as if a giant's power had been infused in my system; the very winds themselves, in their wild waftings, shall be shamed by the course of a child, who, upborne by duty and by joy, files on the sacred errand that sooths the sorrows of a despairing parent.” “Your excellency must perceive, that prompted by such noble springs of nature, it is useless to dissuade the young man from being in person the first to bear the good news of his deliverance to Mienheer Leisler;” quoth Nicholas Bayard who, with ill cloaked chagrin, had been the sullen and silent spectator of the over-throw of his deep laid plans, and whose countenance had suddenly cleared up during Arnyte's last speech, and now bore no trace of discontent, “and I, for my own part, must say, that I at once applaud the motives, and admire the propriety, of the action and intention of this praiseworthy stripling,” he continued, with apparent frankness, “I must confess me, colonel Sloughter, that I did disapprove of mercy towards Jacobus Leisler, for I deemed it wrong, one so criminal should escape severe punishment; but since the matter is as it stands—since your excellency hath been so moved by the touching distress of his son—and I must say, I myself heard the youth with no little emotion; my heart bled in pity, as he spoke for his life, and I did forget the guilt, while the innocent interceded, and wonder not at your excellency's being prevailed on to extend a pardon and forgiveness to the culprit, being so powerfully pressed therefor; none but a brute could have done otherwise—and since, I repeat, your excellency hath granted clemency towards Mienheer Leisler, it becomes me to state, that as to every personal feeling of my own, I am gratified at the event. Whatever false suggestions may be started to the contrary by my enemies, I assert, I have acted towards Jacobus Leisler in all things, even in persuading his execution, by that which I deemed for the best interest of the public—the peace and safety of this province. No liberal-minded man can blame me for what I have done, what I may have advised—having solely acted under such impressions; but let me add, admiration for the son hath conquered in my breast even those prudent wishes for the father's death; and I am now somewhat inclined to think, your excellency, mercy in this case will do more towards planting the olive in this colony, than would harsh measures. If I am not deceived, there is a pledge in the countenance of young Mienheer Leisler, to the effect that he will not be backward in the compact of peace; and since the urgency of his filial duty demands his leaving my roof so soon, I would say it becomes him not to part in anger with his host. I doubt not he hath deemed me an enemy, but let the past be forgotten; I have made the first advance, though an older man—and if he will accept the courtesy, a horse from my stable, than whose breed none swifter ever ran, awaits his order to bear him to the city on his pious errand—while it shall be my duty, as my office of secretary to your excellency's dictates, to have the formal pardon drawn out; and as its completion would only delay Mienheer Leisler's impatience, as soon as it is sanctioned by your excellency, it shall be sent for the immediate release of Jacobus Leisler. I extend my hand and desire your friendship, young man.” Although there was as it seemed a loathing which he could not conquer in the heart of Arnyte towards Leisler, yet in the excess of happiness, his very enemy appeared less hateful—and the sentiments and actions, which at another time from Bayard would only have 28* elicited caution and an idea of duplicity, were in a mind pervaded with pleasure, met with confidence. So sudden and inconsistent is the transition of the human feelings, that he, that but awhile before looked with an eye jaundiced by grief upon mankind, now excited by a favourable change of momentary fortune, viewed even him who he had reason to believe an implacable and wily foe, with kindness, and became easily a rash and ready victim for deception. Arnyte had no time nor feeling for cool deliberation on the evidently studied form by which Bayard had addressed him—he but glanced his eyes towards him, for he saw the governor appeared gratified with Bayard's behaviour, and with looks expectant and somewhat wistfully, was gazing on his countenance. “I will not by a remembrance of ancient enmity mar the satisfaction of the present moment,” said he, meeting with a cordial grasp the hand that was offered him, “and, colonel Bayard, I do accept the courtesy you proffer; and albeit, I hope from my very heart, that in this tendered kindness, all animosity between the names of Bayard and Leisler may for ever cease. I will attend where you lead, sir—for time doth wear, and I long for my father's arms. God keep your excellency!”—And having made his leave of colonel Sloughter and Jost Stoll, Arnyte with a rapid pace, followed Bayard from the apartment. His conductor, as he preceded him, by various little attentions evidently endeavoured to win his confidence, and to erase from out the tablet of his breast, the late rankling sores and wounds cut by long rooted hate and ire. SECTION III.—Ended. More than an hour elapsed before Bayard, after his departure with Arnyte, returned to the apartment wherein Colonel Sloughter and Jost Stoll had remained, and they during that period were too busily engaged to mark its progress, while they interchanged at once relations of their escapes from the hands of Kid and his crew, and their mutual congratulations on each other's safety, so that when their host entered the room, after his temporary absence, they were scarce aware of the length of time that had been consumed in their intercourse. The aspect of Bayard as he advanced towards his guests, was calm, clear, and placid as a summer stream at mid-day, when no breeze lives to ruffle its limpid surface; all clouds had fled his brows, which were open and free as innocence itself; but yet amidst all his courteous bearing and collected manner, the keen eye of observance might have descried, but which by his companions was unmarked, that ever and anon an expression shot upon his countenance—a movement of feature between a smile and a sneer, whose indefinite meaning was hard to be read, as whether applying in contempt to those whom he was addressing, as the pagan worships his idol, or as the fantasy that mingled with some wandering thought of things not present to his vision, and perhaps ideal. In the look, the timid and suspicious would have drawn an evil inference, without being able to trace the reason; for it was as the flash of a serpent's eye, caught then lost in its ambushment in the green and deceitful grass of the savanna, whose forest of tangled spears might in vain be searched for a trace of the danger, the reality of which is only made known when too late to escape the darting fang of the treacherous animal. Bayard explained the cause of the delay of his return, by informing Colonel Sloughter that his absence had been occasioned by the reception of several of his excellency's council, and many of the leading members of the new assembly for the province, which, according to the writs of summons issued by his excellency's order to the sheriffs of the different counties, was to commence its session early in the coming month, had arrived at the mansion for the purpose of assuring his excellency of the entire devotedness of the Legislature to the views of the Governor, and who now remained awaiting the presence of Colonel Sloughter for personal communication to that purport. Bayard also mentioned that he had taken the liberty to order a preparation for such proper entertainment as his residence supplied, for the use and refreshment of his excellency and his friends, and to partake of the same, he now invited him and the ensign, Jost Stoll; for the latter of whom was prudently hinted that a change of apparel was in readiness. Colonel Bayard, in thus addressing the Governor, but slightly touched on the name of Leisler; and that only to a direct inquiry of Colonel Sloughter,—he answered that he had seen Arnyte depart, and that the pardon was in a state of forwardness, and would very shortly be handed to his excellency for approbation; but he the rather appeared to avoid and pass over rapidly all that related to the object of his late reconciliation, or of the condemned parent of the stripling; he spoke but briefly and carelessly on the matter, and shunned with evident caution a recur rence of discourse upon the subject, by artfully directing the governor's attention to points of political importance, the thought and discussion of which at once engrossed his excellency when started, to the manifest forgetfulness of of all minor objects. Colonel Sloughter proceeded with Bayard to meet his expectant visitors; but he was somewhat startled on entering the apartment where they were assembled, to behold a table spread forth with the luxu ries of a sumptuous feast, and the arrangement of festival which pervaded the whole chamber, and for which he had in nowise been prepared; neither from the words of Bayard had he drawn any thing which could intimate the brilliance that surrounded him, when he entered the room, as with the suddenness of magic; so much was he taken unawares by the appearance of festivity, the gorgeous glitter that met his dazzled sight, and the gay, smiling, and rich attired assemblage who pressed to greet his entrance, that he yielded unreservedly, the very direction of his motions, to his conductor, who appeared, had an opportunity chanced, to have no wish for further explanation; and he allowed himself to be ushered by Bayard through the bowing throng, to a seat which seemed to have been destined for him at the head of the feast, the enjoyment of which apparently had only wanted his sanction to have commenced; and although Colonel Sloughter was astonished at the splendour and the crowd to which he was introduced, yet unwarned as he was of the least expectation, beyond the simple reception of his friends, he could not view the spectacle that greeted him as other than a most respectful and flattering attention on the part of his host, secretly and delicately planned, at once to amaze and please him with unlooked for homage; and the more the Governor reflected on the art with which he had been kept in ignorance of the getting up of the entertainment, which he construed as a celebration of his safe arrival, and success in putting down sedition in the very outset of his government of the province, the greater was the gratification to his vanity —and he lent himself to the warm glances of an almost apparent worship, that were bent upon him as he were a superior being—a star among the men with whom he mingled without suspicion or deeper thought. How weak how feeble the penetration which from the outer beauty of an object sets its intrinsic worth, or that gathers faith from false show, nor descries the deep and wily artifice beneath the gaud which covers but to blind the incautious eye—cut credulity is the failing of many, and when assailed by sycophantic hypocrisy it seems to love its own destruction, and he that should be the most shunned is soonest embraced, for the darkest villain too often wears the goodliest outside, and he whose specious tongue and bearing cloaks his foul nature, can worm into the confidence, while the honest are scorned; and little did Colonel Sloughter, as he scanned with the sparkling glance of pleasure, the tasteful decorations, the rich and costly food that loaded the tables, the red wine that bubbled to the beakers' brim, and the livery of mirth and revel worn by each cheek, know that the short absence of Bayard when he conducted Arnyte to his mansion door glowing with success at the promised preservation of his father, had devised the dark design of which he was now the willing yet blinded dupe.—Evil stratagems are visited by the smiles of fortune more than honest endeavours—and Bayard found both means, time, and persons propitious to his wish, and not one of these seeming courtiers, who as a lover wooes the heart of his mistress, sought the favour of the Governor, but were the devoted partizans of Bayard or of the principles which had doomed the death of Leisler; and to perpetrate the deed they aimed at, no obstacle—no tie sacred or honourable but they would ruthless of all conscience, at once break down and destroy;—they thirsted for the blood of their adversary— so inveterate the rage that nought less than life could satisfy them,—and to such fearful purport, though for the time disguised, rather than obeisance to their new ruler, was this concerted meeting and banquet. The revel of the festive board, the free passage of the rosy hued goblet, and the gay and cheering discourse of social happiness, wore on the swift winged hours; each visage in that apartment shone in gladsome triumph of mirth and joy, and none could discern beneath the festal mask the colour of the venomous and deceptive hearts which were concealed in the bosoms of those wily revellers;—and ever and anon, amid the pauses of that banquet, there would burst out from the attendant musicians, sweet strains of melody,—from trump and clarion, viol and recorder,—making the heart bound and leap at their delicious clamours, and drowning all discordant thoughts within the merry sound; and when the early twilight proclaimed the closing day, bright lamps cast down upon the busy feasters their dazzling rays, and lit the sparkling wine cups, as the loud song and blithe pledge passed from lip to lip in fast and pleasant route. In the present scene, Sloughter lost all remembrance of that which had passed: the tears of Arnyte were forgotten in the moment of wassail; none recalled to his recollection the pardon which he had bound himself by word to grant to Leisler, and even Jost Stoll, though a guest at the banquet, reminded him not of the suffering prisoner; for though the bright goblet stood on the board by him untasted, yet so eager did he ply his pencil in draughting the figures at the festal as they engaged his fancy, that his mind's eye and ear was as one deaf and blinded to word or thought, that could divide him from his occupation, and on the gay group, among whom he sat, he looked with the admiring eye of a spectator, who views the picture of some master painter, delighted with every change of place and shadow, colour and tint that the shifting scene presented to his vision. The character of colonel Sloughter in most points, hath been heretofore presented; therefore it will not be supposed, bred up to the manners and dissipations of a licentious court, that he was abstemious enough to withstand the frequent presentation of the wassail bowl; he was one of those men who in the day of adversity or sorrow only feel repentance and form solemn resolutions, which as the tide of their fortunes turn, are driven to the winds, with whose pleasant waftings they are sailing;—awakened conscience, a certain rectitude of thought which often roused within him, had demanded of him a reform of manners and of life, and stimulated to a course that would give his latent and dormant energies of mind towards the honour and happiness of the country which he was called to govern; but he wanted strength, he lacked firmness, to put in force against temptation, such resolves as in the moment of reflection he determined on. An ancient habit, particularly if dissolute, clings to the human system like a snake when he hath twisted around his wictim; cut the reptile in twain, the dismembered body will still strive to enfold in death the conquering antagonist, and perhaps with a last and fatal stroke, even in the expiring agony in the moment of defeat, the venomous creeper may attain the victory and yield its latest breath, well pleased with the ruin it effected. Often, too often in the progress of that banquet, did the wine cup as it circled round the board, fill with its potent yet smiling poison, the ready hand of Sloughter—and besides, with many a guileful pledge for his health, his happiness, and his fortunes, hollow and empty wishes, which went no further than the formation of the utterance, did the artful conspirators who were around him, ply his courtesy with many a recurring draught, compelling him in pretended friendship, to drain goblet on goblet, until sense reeled under the influence of the liquor he had drank, and scarce a faculty remained over which the powerful grape did not domineer. Bayard, with looks gleaming in the hope of anticipated success, marked the vain struggle of Sloughter's intellect as reason contended for mastery on its tottering throne, shaking in its fruitless conflict like a tower shattered by the battering of a fierce leaguer. His mental darkness fast increased, and he quaffed now floods of the juice of the vine, until his mind became like a wandering bark left astray upon the ocean without a star to guide its way, and every guard of passion and of temper was loosened by the excess into which he was plunging momently deeper and deeper. The wary enemies of Leisler now deemed the time at hand to push their intrigue to the point for which they had schemed, for colonel Sloughter appeared fit to be worked, as an helpless instrument, to their purposes—for such was his situation, that it seemed as if common discretion had fled him, and his whole soul had surrendered to the present debauchery, like a town whose gates are opened by a treacherous inmate, to the entrance of the foe.” “Hast heard, Mienheer Pell,” said Bayard, to the person who was seated next to him, and though he spoke apart as if he meant not the governor to remark what he discoursed, yet he perceived colonel Sloughter could not avoid, even in the confusion of the revel, hearing what he said, and he to whom he had addressed himself well knew the part set out for him to perform, for he was the devoted creature of Bayard, and by his influence he had been returned as the member of the colonial assembly from the county of Westchester; the ready tool of his master, the character of John Pell of Pelham, was depicted in his countenance—he was a short stout man, of rather handsome features, and right bravely attired;—but he bore a supercilious cast of visage, with eyes that sparkled with cunning and deceit—that told the knave and the hypocrite. “Hast heard, Mienheer Pell,” said Bayard, “of the gracious mercy that his excellency hath been pleased to extend to Jacobus Leisler?—why sooth, Mienheer, you look at me in wonder; know you not that the traitor hath received a full and free clearance of all crime? he is pardoned by the governor's order—or at least, his excellency hath given promise to such end.” “Impossible! you jest, colonel Bayard—the thing cannot be,” quoth Pell in return, as one stricken with wonder and alarm, “pardoned, say you? surely his excellency hath never been so rash—so heedless, as to set at large the caged tiger, who wants but freedom, to spring upon the throat of his benefactor. I say, colonel Bayard, his excellency can never have done an act so adverse to his own safety, and that of his government;— he must be unassuredly aware that within but a brief period past, the authorities have discovered bloody and deadly designs, on the part of the still existing partizans of the rebel Leisler, which want but his liberation to be put in force; and these designs threaten not only the over-throw of the existing executive, but it hath been whispered, and not I presume, without foundation, that his life is equally compassed. I do indeed trust, though if I heard aright from you, the thing is settled by his excellency—but if not, that colonel Sloughter will pause, ere he definitely decides on so unwise a measure.” “It is most certain,” replied Bayard deceptively, “that in the matter his excellency hath not had chance to exercise his accustomed prudence and judgment; nor, Mienheer, for I was present at the scene, and my heart melted to womanish weakness, could any man, have withstood being so assailed, the tears, cries and lamentations of the young man, who worked on the goodness and merciful nature of his excellency. And now the Vol. II. 29 thing is past, as I review it, I am, I must admit, somewhat ashamed, to have been so deluded—for I much doubt me but the stripling Leisler's an artful knave, and acted a wily and ensnaring part—and as you have intimated, I do somewhat fear me, at the next meeting we have with the youth, he will have the bared knife at our throats, demanding submission to his upstart father for the kindness he recived from his excellency in the gift of life. I must say it Mienheer Pell, the more I reflect, the more I misdoubt me of its truth;—his excellency hath not yet placed his name on the pardon. I do most humbly and fervently pray, he will not do the thing without consideration—the act may be his ruin.” “Colonel Bayard—Mienheer Pell,” quoth his excellency, interrupting the converse and struggling for words against the potency of the wine he had drank, and although every other feeling within him was overpowered by its influence, still a desire for vindication of the proceeding which mitigated the sentence of Leisler, shot like a ray of sunlight through a cloud, upon his burthened brain—“colonel Bayard—Mienheer Pell,” said he, “my friends, I will tell you—that is, good sirs, I will convince you—but you know the boy saved my life— and—and the right I'll not dispute with you—but I could not bring myself to sign the father's death; no matter— while the heart's rejoicing, why strike a melancholy chord? I drink to you, gentlemen—with this flowing goblet, I salute ye, sirs.” Pell bowed to colonel Sloughter as he drained his wine cup, in answer to the compliment. “May God preserve your excellency,” said Bayard as the governor drank, “and knowing my affection,” he continued, “you will surely pardon my pressing this subject untimely, even at the social board, for I seek of you not to spare against the counsel of your friends, the life of a traitor, lest you rue such clemency; revoke the promise which you have given, I beseech you, and which but disgraces the firmness and impartial action of your station, and sign instead of the pardon, this, the death warrant, which will release for ever your excellency and the province of the worst foe you have. It becomes your excellency to act with decision—let not then, a false pity interfere with a correct administration of justice; let not the grave sentence of a court of law, be a mockery—a shallow breath for criminals to laugh at as a maygame, and not a reality—let it not be a proverb, that the law hath sentenced, but your excellency hath made its solemn decree an idle word. If your excellency spare the life of Jacob Leisler, it were well you burn your statutes—for it will not be in consistency— nay, it will be a commission of a crime in your excellency, to visit murther, felony—yea, the worst of iniquities that human hand can do, or mind suggest, with the severity of their appointed punishment. I call on your excellency for your own honour's sake, to write your sanction on this warrant, which approves the judgment of the court against the rebellious traitor Leisler.” And as he spoke, Bayard produced the death warrant, which he had about him for the occasion. But though the brain of Sloughter was too much heated and disordered by his dissipation for a capability of thought or care, memory or reflection, yet as Bayard presented him the parchment and he comprehended that which was sought of him, an involuntary shudder ran through him, and with a tremulous motion he put aside the band which offered him the warrant, as awakened somewhat to his conscious inability of mind, and his unfit state to perform so serious a duty of his office. “Not now, colonel Bayard, not now,” exclaimed he rapidly, “to-morrow I will be more at leisure to hear and think—yes, to follow what you advise—but now, the cheery goblet waits and chides my laggard lip; you would not have one doom a life away over this wine cup —that which foams within its circlet is of a ruddy hue, but let it not be blood—blood—blood—that were a vain conceit—I thirst not for blood, but I pledge ye again and again, by the bright and glowing bowl.” Bayard perceiving the attempt as yet premature to induce colonel Sloughter to consent to Leisler's execution, desisted from his persuasion for the time, and eagerly, in spite of his years, by new excess and increased debauch, endeavoured to drown the governor's few remaining senses in utter imbecility, anxious to finish the work of destruction which had been resolved against the hated enemy of his party. Nor was he defeated in his treacherous object—for besides the conquering bowl to advance the evil purpose of his wily brain, having by lascivious converse inflamed the soul and passions of Sloughter to a callousness of all virtue, he introduced to aid a completion of his work the loose and wanton presence of the courtezan, who by the witcheries and spells of pretended love wound him to their wish, subduing him by their artful smiles to very bondage. And soon warm and flushed by wassail and the banquet—bewildered by music and the voluptuous songs of women, whose sorceries pervaded every sense—entranced to madness by the deluding light of sparkling eyes, whose brightness told of heaven, but in which neither truth nor faith existed—but shone in beauty and enchantment as the false mirage on Arabian sands to the thirsting pilgrim, who meets a dreary waste where he deemed there flowed the cool and lucid water—giddy with the happiness of the hour, rewarded by the kiss of a leman, and applauded by the praise of the rioter, Colonel Sloughter affixed his signature to the fatal deed which condemned Jacob Leisler to the scaffold, almost ignorant at the moment of the purport of that which he had done—although at another period he would rather have had the right hand severed from the limb than it should have guided the pen to the execution of that instrument. But though after that revel closed, his midnight rest was troubled, and feverish, and broken with wild dreams, that started him in fear and horror from his hot and uncomfortable couch, yet morning's light that dawned on his sallow cheek and sunken eye, and aspect worn and sicklied as with care and age, found him unconscious of the act that he had lent his power to, on the preceding evening—he knew not he had signed the death warrant—though 'mid bright dreams and images of loveliness, of flowers, garlands, music, rose odours, and smiles, and all the ravishing brilliance of the past banquet, there would come vague and gloomy thoughts that floated like clouds before the face of the bright heavens athwart his soul—a heaviness on his heart—a damp like death would rise upon his forehead, and with the melody of song that stole upon his enraptured memory, there would mingle that which his chilled spirit construed as a solemn knell foreboding death or sorrow, and for an instant the warm current of his blood would chill until he laughed that which he deemed but folly from him, and his brow was clear again, and his bosom calm and tranquil in forgetfulness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">29* BOOK THE FIFTH. THE CONCLUSION. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds That sees into the bottom of my grief? Romeo and Juliet. When Bayard, accompanied by Arnyte Leisler, quitted the Governor and Jost Stoll, he proceeded to direct a horse to be prepared with instant despatch for the stripling's use and assistance, and with apparent kindness and attention, as one endeavouring to do away all former feelings of enmity, by his present interest and anxiety to forward the youth's impatient wish to hasten to his parent, he conducted him to the place where the animal was caparisoning, and with his own presence urged his menials to swiftness in donning the steed's apparel; nevertheless, while the task of preparation was going forward, at one time Arnyte remarked a brief absence of his host from his side, and when he returned, the number of busy hands employed about the horse was increased, so that his momentary departure seemed explained by a desire of making his kind service keep pace in accordance to the impetuous urgings of speed from the youth; but beside the household attendant that had followed him, there came upon the step of Bayard, four savage looking men, wild and strange in appearance as in attire. These were of that race of mixed cast and blood, well known in the colony by the designation of half breeds, the equal descendant of the debauchery of the white and the indian, and inheriting all the evil qualities of the European and the savage; an idle, loitering, lazy set, the vagabonds of the settlements, these beings existed by pilfering and crime alone; leading a wandering life, like the gipsey, they traversed the province, rioting and wassailing while in sunshine and health, and when by age, sickness, and drunkenness, reduced and destitute, they crowded the werkhuis or the bridewell, or perished and rotted by the way side. Without a thought or care for the future, the proceeds of the only labour which the men and women of this species applied themselves to at any moment,— the making of ozier and wicker baskets, or shooting with the bow and arrow at halfpence for the delight of gaping children and boors,—were almost as soon as received expended in liquor, for which they crowded the open tippling houses, which, spite of the law against selling them such potent poisons, were ever thronged with these unmindful and wretched barbarians, and who, when inebriated and stripped of their money, were cast forth by the publican from his house, and left night or day in the streets or road to slumber and wallow in their loathsome condition of mind and body, uncared for and unregarded except by the sportive or brutal tortures inflicted on their misery by wicked urchins, who, with impunity were accustomed to use in such amusement every invention of cruelty. In every thing these were a distinct people, equally despised by the red man and the white, and even scorned by the slave; treacherous, dishonest, and cowardly, they possessed a vile subtleness of nature, and a disposition for revenge, whose effect was often felt, though the source scarcely ever to be traced. Many were the instances related where his long absence had alarmed the family of some honest colonist, who in the morn had gone forth in hope, in health and vigor; but whom the searchers found lying in some lone nook of wood or rock, cold and stark in death; his face buried in the sand, and in his back the fatal wound, unknown the hand, untraced the murderer's foot; some thicket, tangled and pierceless, or some low wall concealed from his victim the presence of his enemy, as he skulked to aim the deadly ball; no track for justice existed, and even had the murdered been spared, perhaps his remembrance could give no clue for the wanton attempt at his destruction, for all forgotton was the spurning blow that drove from his door the beggar, who for years had cherished hate and watched with lynx-eyed eagerness the chance that might repay the slight injustice he had received with the heart's blood of the offender; thus remorseless and capable of every crime, bought and sold as it were for a glass of liquor, these losels haunted the farms and houses of the colonist like a pestilence, scarcely to be driven away by violence; for regardless of threats, they were often forced to be tolerated in fear, hatred, and contempt;—and groups of these creatures, boys and men, squalid with dirt, filth and idleness, were many times to be seen sitting lazily in the sunshine beside the barn wall, mumbling the fragments given them by the farmer from the leavings of his meals who sought for the safety of his farm yard to propitiate their gratitude, though warned by experience, how little of such feeling they possessed. Not alone to individuals were they a source of continual trouble and vexation, but many times the means of grievous inconvenience to the government; for incited by a desire for mischief as well as plunder, they would trespass in hordes on the hunting grounds of the Indians, rob and fire their wigwams, deserted by their warrior inhabitants while absent in some expedition in search of game, steal and destroy their venison and buffalo beef, and commit such aggressions as to incite the red man on his return, to a retaliation on the dwellings of the province, which usually led into bloody broils, alarm and war. Well knowing the nature and character of these men, and their sight, as a colonist born, being to him no rare occurrence, Arnyte scarce noted their presence, nor allowed a thought to lose itself upon them, deeming their coming had no incentive but idle curiosity; in sooth, the mind of the youth was elated beyond all bounds by the prospect of preservation of life he had attained for his parent; his spirits were buoyed to their uttermost pitch, and his whole soul engrossed with happiness so great, that no other idea could enter—so that although he perceived Bayard ever and anon hold converse in a suppressed under tone with the half breeds, and their quick dark cunning eyes ofttime directed on him with an expression which might have alarmed him, could he have indulged a suspicion of treachery when his heart so overflowed with pleasure and hope—but he suffered not that which could have disturbed him to obtrude upon his imaginings, and with an unsuspecting and careless glance, viewed their frequent and secret discourses. The half breeds with whom Bayard thus bestowed his attention, had all the looks of craftiness of their race; their dress were Indian hose and mocassins, a faded blue petticoat that came half way down the thigh; one had the Indian blanket, and the others the European waistcoat and surtout; they wore earrings in their ears, and their dark hair was platted and clubbed down their backs. In their whole apparel, was an odd mixture of savage life and civilization; on their heads they had either an Indian cap, or some half worn and tattered hat that had been bestowed on the wearer, who had adorned it with strings of wampum; each had his bow and arrows, his knife, tomahawk, and cruse for water. It was evident from the satisfaction that beamed in their tawny features, that they were pleased with the intercourse of Bayard, and as they stood looking on the engaged attendants as they prepared the steed with the careless and listless attitude of idlers, one of them, as if in search of some object to break the inaction of his mind, amused himself by casting in the air a glittering piece of silver, which he caught as it fell with singular dexterity. And now the steed he was to mount, was fully accoutred and brought forth at Arnyte's behest—it was a beautiful creature, and of a most rare species in the northern clime—of a race imported by Sir Edmund Andross for his own use, and by him, a scion of the blood was presented to his friend and favourite colonel Bayard. The light, ductile, yet sinewy limbs of the noble quadruped, looked as if the speed of the winds was in them, and as the groom led him by the tightened rein, he struggled fiercely, and champed the bright bit in wrath, shaking from his mouth gouts of foam which spotted his dark black hide, like flakes of loose snow caught by the eaglet's wing in its alpine flight—with chest thick, panting, wide spread and smoky nostril, and eyes that rolled alternate with fear, like the wild deer at the approach of man, and then in fire,—the gallant animal snorting and pawing with raging hoof the ground about the place where he was held, awaited an unwilling slave, and reluctant in his thraldom, the will to which he was destined; and Arnyte's hand was in his flying mane buried deep and firmly—his foot was in the stirrup, and the horse reared, swerved and couched in anger, as if he would have avoided the power and might which he vainly battled against—the stripling had risen for the leap which would have borne him to the saddle, and the lip of Bayard was busied with smiling and friendly assurance, at the very moment when a weighty blow from some arm behind him, descended on the unprotected head of the unfortunate youth, with an overpowering force and stunning violence; his eyes flashed—his sense reeled—his foot and hand relaxed their hold—the steed started from him and flung him to the ground. Nathless, while struggling for mastery with the spirited charger on which his eye had been fixed, and with thought filled alone with one unsharing object, on Arnyte, the stroke that felled him, came as from an unseen source—yet, as he dropped beneath its potency, as by instinct, rather than chance, his eye met that of Bayard, and there sprang forth for the instant, in its wildness of agony, a look that blazed of fierce resentful hate and bitter reproach commingling, while on the ashen features of Bayard sat a grim smile that savoured of satisfaction and triumph, as where the tiger gloats on the powerless throes of the dying and mangled carcass of his fallen prey after its savage and desperate conflict for life; but the glance of Arnyte was but momentary, it was like the last vivid and shooting flash of an expiring lamp ere it dies in utter darkness, a late start of recurring life ere it subsides back in death,—for there came a hollow rattle in his throat the exerted struggling of the voice—there was a slight, short tremor as though the ice was curdling o'er his heart, and the wandering beam of sight became dull and hollow, vague and glassy with vacancy,—and he lay prostrate on the earth as an inanimate corpse still, stirless, strengthless, motionless; for so wanton the violence that had been used towards him—so stiff, cold and stark his limbs that one would have deemed, to look upon his pallidness, that light had gone from him never again to revisit nerve or limb; and in truth for a time as with the piteous fluttering of the wounded bird, who strives to raise its flight to the elements it loves, with plumage spread in vain; or as the battling swimmer gasping to snatch a hold upon some shattered plank, the fragment of the wreck, but which seems safety in despair as now the wave upheaves him within its reach, yet ere he can seize it, the whelming and deceptive billow dashes him away again to renew his efforts to attain that which he had lost,—so life sought to resume its lingering energies; one by one, slow and heavily, as drops that trickle down the rocky sides of some dank dungeon, his senses returned—throb by throb, pulse by pulse the laggard beatings of his heart and reins began, and when his blood reflowed it was with a thrilling and convulsive pang that shook his dismal trance. What certain lapse of time the stripling passed in the blackness of that ghastly insensibility he could not tell—yet it was long ere he recovered, and then the first sensation of recurring life was sickness—his frame felt chilled, numbed, and deadened, and his brain was restless and painful and sore with giddiness, and his sight though strained to burst the dense film that appeared to cover his eyes, was dull and indistinct—now it seemed as if there was a passing gleam of earth, sky and wave that swam swiftly by as with an arrow's flight, anon all was wild midnight pierceless and interminable—so light and darkness alternate combatted, and when wearied and faint with vain efforts, the heavy lids dropped down upon the blood-shotten orbs to shut out the confused phantasies that baffled vision, strange and uncouth noises seemed to ring in his ears, and to hurtle in his brain; mind, thought and perception appeared with fruitless endeavour, like the strife of breakers to o'erleap an impeding crag, to contend for their former empire;—at length a sudden shock broke on the gloominess of the dim and wild uncertainty—from whence it came, or what it was that disenthralled him for the time he had no conjecture—sparks shot like lightning in his eyes, and an involuntary shriek and start of pain sprang from his trembling lips—his hollow dream was startled from his brows, and he gazed around in wonder as one that wakens from the delirious dozings of a fever—strange objects met his sight, for he was in a place all to him unknown, whither unfriendly hands had in his deep lethargy conveyed him from the spot where he had suffered from the treacherous machinations of the irreconcilable foe of his name—all about him was wild, desolate and drear—above him rolled the grey and gloomy heavens frowning and threatening as a thing of wrath, ominous with brooding tempest. A stormy change since morning had come upon the face of nature, it seemed as if the bright host clouds had been but as that gush of joy and hilarity that is said to herald sorrow—for the sun had lost its light and drearily the day stole on his altered eye, while the wan looks of that faded sky betokened the passage of many hours since last he had read its glories—the wind howled like a thing of life and searched the forest paths with its deep and shrill cry of anger and of pain, and even at the moment of reanimation Arnyte shuddered at its cold, icy, and death-like touch. He lay upon the ground in that which seemed a frightful dell of some vast solitude, craggy and bare, with many a bold precipice and cavern dark as death, within whose recesses the desert wind held sway, and here and there between the chains of belting rocks grew sturdy trees, and a wild waste of underwood girt each clump of hardy oaks, black pine and giant beech as on the dizzy heights where they had taken root they raised their dark diminished heads—huge mounds of ice and snow were piled within the clefts and chasms of the tortuous sweep of hill and crag that filled the bleak and desert places, and as terrible as cheerless was each beetling cliff and overhanging steep.—Bound with many a fearful thong that chafed his swollen and prisoned limbs the stripling lay stretched upon the earth in that dismal spot—while the feeble motion, when he had regained sensation, that he made to free his stark members from the bonds that on him were so fastly tied, discovered to him his desolate situation. Within a few paces from him was that brave courser whose service the false Bayard had tendered him in his dissimulation— but now all his late fire and spirit were fled and quenched, and his force failed; for his mane was dripping and his flank reeking with travel, which judging from his soiled hoof had been of weary length, and it appeared as though descending the gorge of the dell he had sank beneath his toil—for with sides heaving as on a rack, and frame at length o'erspent and fallen to the ground, immoveable he was—his gallant chest and skin ruffled and dabbled with blood, his flesh galled and torn by the pointed rocks and scattered stone on which he had dropped— while the big round tears stood in his weeping eyes, and now and then he muttered a feeble moaning sound of pain that told of hurt severe and incurable, for his heart laboured in its deep drawn utterance as though it would have burst. About the body of the helpless and prostrate steed, still were entwined many a broken fragment of cord, portions of whose parted shreds clung to the form of Arnyte; for by these, along the horse's back, a powerless and insensible prisoner, the youth had been bound, nor was released until the wearied and drooping animal, stumbling and staggering with his heavy load, gave way to toil; for as his feet reeled, and his form writhed in its last faint effort to uphold itself, the bonds that linked the stripling to the struggling wretch, were wrenched and snapped in twain; and luckily, for had the courser's crushing weight borne on him, he had not escaped injury. Arnyte was throw some distance from the dying creature; and it was the suddenness and power wherewith he had thus been cast to earth that had so strangely recalled life and recollection to him late locked in that fearful senselessness. About the poor beast watching his sufferings, unable either to extricate him from his peril or alleviate his condition, stood three of the half-breeds of Vol. II. 30 whom mention hath been above made, while a fourth held by the miserable and broken reins, the horses from which the accident of the one that had borne their captive, for such Arnyte evidently appeared to be, had, for the time, caused them to dismount. These animals, accustomed to hard service and rough travel all their days, had not laboured so severely as the gallant charger; the reason for whose being thus abandoned to the perilous hands of the half breeds was easily to be divined, in the supposition that Colonel Bayard, sacrificing every delight and pride in possessing so fine a creature, for the important interest of the moment, had parted with him for the hasty conveyance of Arnyte from the place where his presence had for the while counteracted his wishes, and foiled his immoveable determination of revenge, or perhaps as certain a conclusion, while tearing the stripling away from the scene of action—that his own savage object might meet with no obstacle to hinder its certainty of execution; the enemy of Leisler had surrendered his favourite steed, that its burden might have a swifter journey to his last bourne; that by an earlier doom he might be rid of the influence of one who had proved as potential as unexpected an intercessor with Governor Sloughter to prevent his evil designs;—the horses of the half breeds were gaunt-limbed, strange and rugged looking animals, small and clumsy in appearance, with untrimmed, neglected and bristling manes and tails, and rough and shaggy hides, the hair of which was long and uneven, and while their broad chests bespoke uncommon sinew and strength, their short thick necks were archless and their heads hung passive and spiritless, and their large eyes seemed dull, patient and heavy; they were without caparisons, for wretched strips of untanned hide served for bridles, and the backs of all, except one, which was covered with a small, dingy and ragged piece of blanket, were bare and naked, nor were the riders inconvenienced by the want of saddles, but were thus accustomed to bestride their horses, and when mounted, their own singular habiliments did but assort with the wild looking quadrupeds that bore them. A moment's glance sufficed to disclose to young Leisler his forlorn and hopeless situation, while at once, as his eye drank in the dreary and disconsolate prospect before him, rude memory, big with care and sorrow, crowded his brain with all the dismal and unwelcome images of the past, and imagination, gloomy with woes to come, excited the mind to very sickness; he sought not to ask a question, even had he hoped an answer from the half breeds, whose piercing gaze ever and anon was turned upon him, while their dark visages were shadowed with an ominous and forbidding expression—his one glance had told him all, his fear and his despair; for well did he construe the treachery of Bayard; his aim was not to be mistaken, and the direful events that must succeed the triumph of his stratagem, rushed like a flood of burning and searing fire upon his brain, while his temples throbbed in unison with the agony of his suffering mind: on his own wretched stress, his danger, the smart of his wounded brow, lacerated by the blow that in the moment of his happiness, had blasted at once, hope, joy, energy, and nearly life itself; on the lawless and untamed beings, to whose durance he was abandoned; and the extent of cruelty and persecution, of which he was the destined victim; on these, scarce for an instant he bestowed reflection;—his father! his rising heart swelled to his lips in that deep distress with which the memory crossed him; that parent, whose safety he had deemed all but assured, who, for the time, as from the very verge of the grave, had been restored, had been rescued from sealed death, and that too by the perseverance and exertions of his grateful child; and yet that parent, so hardly won, so dearly bought from the rude clutches of destruction, was again abandoned—lost —utterly lost! plunged down deeper than before in the darksome and yawning gulf, whose shadow he had but just seemed to have escaped; and then came the bitter pang, that stuck as with a vulture's fang into the breast, that blind trusting credulity had aided malice and deception to the fearful wreck; and then too came the enforcement of the machinations, for whose triumph he had been betrayed, and the fresh budding shoot of hope blasted as by a stroke of fire. Awhile he seemed not to see the gray rocks, rude hills, and forest trees, that with their frosted heads, like tombless spectres, toppled o'er him; but there swam in his sight the gloomy dungeon of his parent, and the pale and waning form of its lonely and disconsolate inmate; the horrid scaffold too, reeking with blood, seemed pictured to his heart, and on his brain each vision the wild madness of despair could conjure up, came flitting by like clouds that are gathered in the train of a midnight storm when it musters in wrath; the past, though dreary, looked not so bleak and cheerless and black as that to come: it was a long and darksome track, such as is shown to the fainting traveller's eye by the lightning on a desert wold; but yet mid all he wept not; no tear-drop dimmed his sight, but his eyelids grew hot, like curtains of burning fire, and the balls stood unmoved, full and wide, nor turned to either side in their glassy gaze, and when excited by the anguish of his mind, forgetful of bondage, he would strive to start from earth, and twist and writhe in his bonds until the blood would trickle from their stretched and tightened clasp, and break his convulsive dream; then recalled to reality by the agony of his wrung limbs, he would give o'er the vain and idle strife which but increased pain, while as motionless he sank his contorted muscles, he gave vent to a hollow groan, whose imperfect tone, broke from his swelling throat, as it were in utter despondency. And hopeless, desperate, almost breathless and stirring not, he would lie like some statue overthrown from its base, and stretched in ruin upon the ground. This state, however, of horrid doubt and conjecture of the situation of his father did not long endure, for now the movements of the half breeds aroused for the while the stripling from his gloomy and melancholy train of reflection. It appeared as if they had held a consultation together on the course which was to be pursued after the unfortunate incident that impeded their farther procedure on the way they had been journeying, but seemingly from the manner of their action, no definite conclusion had been approached; there was no hope to them of service from the miserable animal who was perishing before them, and who, were it possible, untended and unassisted as he was, could he have survived his numerous bruises and wounds must have still been useless, from the limbs he had fractured or broken in his fall, while they were all unwilling to inconvenience the horses that remained sound by an additional burthen. Amid the interval of their irresolution an instant decision of the fate of Arnyte was started, and the dark glances of their fierce eyes that shot towards the hapless object of their deliberation, bespoke the wild and frightful purpose that moved the relentless minds of the majority; yet still with one there was a hesitancy to accede to the full and frightful measures that were strenuously urged by his companions, to rid themselves at once of the trouble of the conveyance of the stripling from the wild and darksome glen wherein he now lay, and whose dreary shadows were so near akin to the deadly deed they planned to perpetrate in its black recesses; nathless he that dissented seemed the chief, and somewhat reluctant the rest bowed to his opinion; however ever and anon striving to shake his thought and persuade him to join in their intentions. And now in the broad heavens cloud on cloud folded o'er each other like a dun mantle, and more bleak and comfortless grew the weather, and soon a thick small rain filled the air as with haze, piercing and penetrating to the flesh through the stoutest garment as with the points of needles—the half-breeds dragged their hapless prisoner with rude and careless violence towards a huge and impending rock beneath whose imperfect shelter they struck a light and collecting some pieces of dry wood and leaves that lay around, soon fanned them in a state of brightness, and then gathering themselves in a circle about the flame, regardless of the situation of their captive, whose being brought near them was the rather for observance, than for any warmth or comfort to his sinking frame, and having drawn forth the tomahawk pipes from their belts, and filled them with herbs from their ready pouches, they began to smoke as at idle and listless length they lay or sat before the fire—with lip and countenance thoughtful, taciturn and unsusceptible. 30* The day waned rapidly, for there was no twilight in the stormy atmosphere, and quick though laden with mist and fog the night rolled on, while at its cold approach the air seemed to increase its chilling temperature; the half-breeds looked now and then with disturbed gaze upon the changes of the heaven, but they spoke not a word, and again resumed instantly after the momentary glance, with an aspect of indifference and unconcern their composed demeanour as they continued their sedate employment, and it was long ere they broke the silence of thought wherewith they had enveloped themselves—an awful and appalling stillness prevailed in that desert dell, interrupted alone by the now distant and stifled groans of the dying courser, or the cry of some expectant raven eager for the repast ere its victim yielded to death as it flapped its wings in hunger while hovering above the expiring wretch, whose flesh was the birds doomed banquet. “Piomingo, I dare to advise and speak true though yet but young, for amid my own people I am not curst with two mouths to deceive and deny it at the same breath,” said one of the half-breeds after a considerable and unbroken period of time had elapsed wiihout the exchanging of a word, and ere he spoke he pulled the calumet from his mouth with a slow and stately motion—“Piomingo, listen to the counsels of Peter Tawereket—the night gathers in tempest and we are far from the wigwam of shelter, it is better we slay the white youth and carry back his scalp to Claus Bayard, it will delight him more than, as he bid us, we sold him a slave to the Utawawas.” “It is not, brother, that I have drunk the liquid fire of the white man,” answered after a moment's pause the person addressed, “but my mother was a Muhekeneew, and the red man's blood is fresh in my veins that my christian father stirs me not to such evil—I would not shame my Indian race though it looks not on me, by murdering the boy—the life of him who hath injured me not, it becomes not the descendant of a sachem to take— though for Claus Bayard's gold and rum I have pledged me to carry him beyond the cabins of the Mahikanders to the land of the allies of the French King—and I keep my pledge—Piomingo breaks not his word with white or red man—though I extend not the belt of peace to either of them yet Piomingo breaks not his word as he had sworn by the Great Spirit—the Kitchtau of the Christian and the Indian—I will carry the boy to the hunting ground of the Utawawas—” “Piomingo, hearken for once to the counsels of Peter Tawereket,” returned the other, “our horses are weak, and like the branch of oak before the wind they sink beneath their labour—we have neither venison nor the strong liquid to support our travel—and it is a moon's journey to the beaver licks of the Utawawas;—let us take the scalp therefore of the white youth and return to the great wigwam and receive the promises of Claus Bayard—this is the counsel of Peter Tawereket.” “Listen to me brother,” quoth another of the half-breeds, “I can tell the white man by his look, though his voice speak false—I know from the eye of Claus Bayard, though his words told it not, that the blood of the white youth will gain more rum and gold from his hand than if he is spared from our knives—he would have bid us tomahawk him, but he did not like to hear the cry of his blood—brother let us despatch the boy—I hear the wolf growl as in anger, he seeks his feast for the night, let us leave him the carcass of the white youth that he follow not our trail.” “Brother,” said the other of the half breeds, who was the least favoured of countenance of all, and assimilated most in manner, words and look to the colonists, having mingled many years in their fashion of life, though late deserting it for the wandering existence of his earliest youth,—“it will not grieve Claus Bayard for the fate of his favourite horse if young Leisler perish with him; and how easy for our lips the tale of the boy's having been crushed in the fall; it will sooth the prickings, (if such there can be,) of Bayard's conscience, and the richer our reward;—brother, let us do the deed—speak but the word, and this knife shall smoke in the varlet's heart's blood.” “Brothers,” replied the leader of the half breeds firmly, at the same time drawing up his form to its full height with pride,—“brothers, I have said it, he shall receive no harm from our hands; and would you have me break the truth of my words? Ryner, I have spoken the boy shall live the slave of the Uttawawas;— Piomingo's word is truth; he will not make it false, for his mother was a Muhekeneew; and though the half breed be despised, he will not forget his Indian race;— Piomingo breaks not his word.” The half breeds finding their chief thus inexorable in his determination against the immediate destruction of their captive, gave over their attempts at persuasion, and sullenly replacing their pipes to their lips, remained cold, reserved, and silent in their discontent, while motionless they sat, and their forms mingled in the gloominess of the surrounding scenery, as though they made a part of the huge fragments of black rock which were shone on by the uncertain firelight. The darkness of the night now momently increased, so that all around seemed girt with one huge and shadowy forest, through whose masses the eye could not pierce, though imagination found food to shape many a wild phantasy; and after an interval, the chief having signified his design, it was resolved by the half breeds, ere they proceeded from the place where they were, that they should await the holding up of the descending haze, and the rising of the moon, to light their journey, for it was impossible to make progress in the fog that now reigned; therefore, they eagerly obeyed the directions of the leader, in heaping on the flame huge piles of brushwood that kindled in large volumes of ascending pyres of light, so that the wild and carnivorous beast of prey, whose cry and bark ever and anon were heard from afar, might be scared from intruding on their assemblage, while with feet to the fire, couched on the wet earth, the half breeds sought a short repose from the fatigue they had already undergone, ere the hour propitious for their departure arrived; nor in their arrangement of rest was the safety of young Leisler neglected. The stoutest of the band threw his strong body across the weak frame of the youth, so that however deep his sleep, the least stir or motion of the hapless stripling would awake him in an instant. There is no one in the living circle of mortality, however wedded to affliction,—wearied of existence,—driven by misfortune, and reduced in moments of sad despair to call for the rest of the grave, that calm and unflinching can face approaching death, and in the hopeless certainty of mind, can count its sure and rapid steps; strange is it, that to the boldest,— “The weariest and most loathed worldly life, That age, ache, penury and imprisonment Can lay on nature, is a paradise To what we fear of death.” For what man, pangless, was e'er resigned to meet the terror of foreboding years,—the last, worst, yet inevitable throe,—the sought, yet shunned when found? for though at a distance greeted as a friend, dreadful is its garb when near; for to the most intolerable wo it brings but an unknown relief, so that even the wretch who hath no heritage but misery and sorrow—whose days have been but one long series of disease, pain, and disappointment, shrinks in the last moment from its embrace, as one that rushes to enjoyment, and clasps a shadow of his desire: for hollow is the hope of happiness the grave promises. The tender infirmities, the resistless throbs of nature awake at its touch in triumph over the cold calculations of reason, or the suggestions of religion. Terrible,— horrible is the idea, to be excluded for eternity from the bright sunbeams and the blessed air,—to be as in a night of slumber, whose duration may be eternal, for whose waking there seems no dawn!—and then that fine, sensible motion of existence that wantons within us, to be for aye extinguished in utter darkness, while the frame that holds it and delights in its animation, lies down, in an undistinguished heap of corruption, trodden upon, spurned, forgotten, scattered like worthless dust into the air—alas! there is nothing soothing to distempered thought in the repose of death; the heart shudders at the last and fearful home of the body wherein it beats, whether it be the princely vault, with its rich coffin and floating and emblazoned pall, the solitary mound with its canopies of rank and yellow nettles and long sickly grass, the crowded cemeteries of the church-yard, with the horrid fruitfulness of its tainted mould, or the battle-plain, where the ranks of the dead are blackened in the sun until they decay, or gorge the ravenous maws of the carrion dogs—no, no! there is nothing welcome in the coming of the grisly monster, death, let his shape be lovely as it may:—the more so, when the sharp and murderous weapon of ruffians is bared at the throat, with no power to obstruct or resist its direful purpose. Heated by the world's wrongs, or nerved by desperation, reckless and eager the self pointed sword is sought as the blessing of madness; but dreadful is it to hear the cold lip of others cater our fate,—measure the duration of life, as it were a matter of no account, a thing most worthless to the speaker, though the all of the miserable victim. Fearful in the chamber of pride, —on the lowly cot of the peasant, is death to man; but far more dreadful is it, when from the sudden and violent hand of his fellow. As Arnyte listened to the converse of the half breeds, in spite of every attempt at resolution, terror shook his trembling frame to very agony; and on his dizzy ear the muttered words of his persecutors struck like blows of might, while his cold brow grew wet with the beaded dew, and his lips were livid, while the swarthy features of the half breeds seemed in his distorted vision to assume the hideous workings of ireful demons;—the very anguish of parting life could not compete with his distress. With an intense attention he heard the discussion, upon whose issue his destruction pended by a mere breath; and as it proceeded, his soul was racked at the preparation of the deed that was to rob him of existence—the lone and solitary dell his tomb,—the moaning wind his dirge,—the mountain eaglet to batten on his corse; was this to be his doom? were all his young hopes thus to wither and perish?—What though awhile dark and cheerless had been his road of life,— who could read the future? Fortune might have smiles in store for to-morrow: to the last moment the condemned criminal gives not all up as lost; yea, even his parent might be preserved, or at least avenged,—pleasure, power, and joy might be at hand, like a train of distant and beautiful forms seen in the passing clouds of a summer sunset, flitted visions of the time to come, but never to be realized; another day might give all that he would desire, but that day he heard was to dawn upon his grave;—the light of to-morrow's sun was to rise upon his stark and bloody corse, done to death by fierce and murtherous violence. Indeed, so powerfully were his feelings wrought upon by the expectation of immediate death, that when the half breeds concluded their converse, he felt like the convict respited at the scaffold's foot; and his mind for the moment seemed as it had received unhoped for relief. Accustomed and inured to the mode of life which often catered less easy couches for their tired limbs than whereon they were resting, the senses of the half breeds were soon wrapt in a slumber so deep, and apparently placid, that even Arnyte envied their unconsciousness. Although exhausted as he was by mental convulsions, and fatigued in body, it was no wonder that at times, for awhile, (brief and momentary as it was,) a drowsiness that crowded his mind would conquer even his miseries; and as the heat of the fire struck through his chilled flesh by degrees, he would drop into a sort of half slumber, during which he appeared to have a vivid perception of the place where he was, and of his situation, while the leading circumstances of life,—that which had brought him to so deplorable a condition, and all connected with them were lost, as it were in forgetfulness, while the weight of the brawny savage that lay upon his breast would crush him, like the riding of the nightmare, and he would gasp beneath it for breath and life. Little was the refreshment he received from such rest, and the slightest motion of the half breed above him would startle him to awaken; and in the pang, the cold sweat would creep upon his temples anew, while recollection of his desperate state, in the full terror of its reality, would again rush on his desolate and alarmed mind; then, for an interval, he would watch the departing storm, as on the face of the broad sky it faded away, as one that contemplated the sudden change of nature from tempest to calmness, as the last he should ever look upon;—and now fast the mists of the night cleared from the visage of the dell; and as they departed, momently and fantastically, they assumed various shapes;—now they looked like a long and solemn train at a funeral, with canopy, pall and plumes, and mourners that moved with steps that were noiseless, and looks dejected, wan and downcast;—then they seemed like a crowd of huge pyramids, columns, towers and battlements, the pomp of some great metropolis; and at last all was disorganized with magical and rapid tumult, and the yellow and rising moon with a faint glow of radiance tipped, as with horns of light, the extremities of rock and tree, and sparkled mildly on the fragments of ice, and patches of snow and frost that seared the ground; the stars too soon began to show themselves in the heaven, at first white and feeble, but anon they glittered like morning dew-drops or the jewels that beprank the dark tresses of an eastern queen. The sleep of the half breeds still continued unbroken, and Arnyte listened to their heavy breathings, and looked on their stirless forms in dread, lest they should awaken and even move, for their motion might forbode harm to him. He viewed their slumbers as he would those of a tiger, the breaking of whose sleep would be punished by the utter annihilation of the disturber; and when as hideous they were stretched in the mingled light of the moon and fire before which they lay, and with the shadow of the night and rock about them, Arnyte observed the heaving of a limb, as in dream it changed position with an involuntary and sudden thrill, which for the moment stopped the quick palpitation of his heart, he would regard the disquiet of the half breeds until along silence allowed his drear and ominous alarm to subside, and reassured his fear. Thus oppressed with the lead-like weight of the sinewy ruffian who lay across him, his brows fevered and hot, and his pulse convulsed by quick successive throbs, dreadful were the lapses of that sickly vigil. After thus having endured a protracted period of suffering, the attention of Arnyte was suddenly aroused from his affliction, by the falling of the brushwood with which the half breeds had heaped their fire; for the larger pieces having been burnt in twain, the smaller brands dropt from the flames, and blazing, were scattered widely around; an ember lighted and of considerable size, by this incident was thrown so near to Arnyte that its fire scorched his flesh, and partly singed the cords which bound his hands together, being stoutly tied about his wrists;—by an effort at once involuntary and desperate, he increased the injury done the thong, and pursuing his advantage by pressing it to the glowing cinder, regardless of the wounds his flesh received from the burning flame, in an instant the links that had so strongly and harshly confined him peeled to ashes, and, in part, he was freed from his thraldom. After having thus unexpectedly attained liberty for his hands, the damp of despair, which in the excitation of the moment had left him, again returned to overwhelm his bosom in misery; for what availed his exertion?—his loosened limbs gave him no chance of escape;—he could not move, but he would arouse a powerful and unequal enemy—and as he looked on the brawny limbed, and sinewy formed savages around him, his heart failed within him;—though he had thus snapped his bonds undiscovered it was but a mockery of fortune that with false hope had shone to plunge him deeper in his wretchedness—it was but an aggravation of his misery that rendered his fate more severe—more bitter his cup of sorrow—with thoughts thus maddened, his wild and eager eye ran over the sleeping figures of his ruthless oppressors, and when he was reduced by sad reflection to the very depth of hopelessness, his sight fell on the girdle of the half-breed whose body rested on his own—his knife was bared and carelessly stuck in the belt—there needed no motion of his form to assist the Vol. II. 31 grasp with which Arnyte seized it—the bright light of the fire reddened the blade as he drew it forth—why paused he? the weapon he brandished was firm in hand—the savage lay defenceless in his power—an instant the load that clogged his breast would be helpless in death—and an instant's resolution might give the opportunity to escape the power of the ruffians to whom he was captive, or his blood would be bought dearly by them—he would not die unharming—but the half-breed slept—slept on his breast, and Arnyte's soul sickened at the deed: to liberate him the arm of the stripling must destroy one who rested on his body like a brother in looks, though with hostile embrace—he must slay one who slumbered on him silent and unconscious—his heart shrunk within him; he could not commit that which had semblance to murder, even though it should save him—the idea was horrid, and every creeping vein shuddered and froze within him, and the steel fell from his relaxed hand and with a ringing rattling noise struck the hard ground—the echo awoke the half-breed, he stirred, he moved, he started and his eyes half opened at the sound—that moment was his last, the youth aware of his danger quicker than thought regained the fallen poniard, and nerved with desperate strength drove it to the heart of the half aroused savage, and in a moment the dying and the conqueror were covered by the bubbling life blood—Arnyte rolled the body of the dead from him; the half breed had not even groaned in the struggle of parting life—though his eyes were wide open and stared forth with glassy lustre, and his teeth were set together, his hands clenched, and his limbs contracted—yet so quickly had he perished, so sure and fatal was his death blow, that he had uttered but a single, stifled, gasping sigh as his spirit departed; Arnyte cut the cords about his feet and sprang upwards while he threw a quick and fearful glance upon the companions of him he had just slain—the fire blazed feebly and irregular, and the light of the moon was flickering and uncertain; their features were dim and frowning, and their long, lank, black hair swept confusedly like branches of the cypress about their breasts and necks—Arnyte almost fancied they moved and were about to start upon him, and awhile unable to depart or withdraw his glance, with a depressing dread as chained to the spot he gazed upon their dim and dusky visages, but their sleep was undisturbed. Arnyte now stooped and took from the dead man his tomahawk, and mechanically he turned his steps from the place, reckless of the direction of his flight so he could avoid the pursuit of the half-breeds, when enraged they should discover the corpse of their fellow on their awakening—shrinking in awe and terror from the very shadows that crowded around him, for to his distorted fancies they took most hideous shapes and forms— gibbering and mowing like spectres as he passed along, so that he dared hardly look about him, lest they should become reality and arrest his progress onwards—he proceeded without guide or knowledge of his way;—his tread though rapid was soft and without noise, as though he feared its sound would betray his course, and his strained eye was often cast back in searching gaze, while imagination painted in every nook the figures of his enemies, and in the speaking wind their hasty following—nor was he long deceived—he heard their cries of mingled horror and revenge—their shouts, their moans, their curses, and he saw them close behind panting and toiling in the hot chace, near, and more near as madly he dragged himself along the rude and cumbered track—but yet his exertions and fatigue seemed in vain, they gained upon him in the desperate race, and the wild thought ran riot in his mind to turn upon his foes and part with life bravely against the fearful odds that pressed upon him, for no other course seemed left him; when as he rushed along his dark and unknown road, he stumbled, impeded by some heavy obstacle in his route, and abruptly fell unable to resist the force of the shock, to the ground, and his sinking weight bearing against a bank of earth and loose stone that guarded the entrance of a-gulley, which ran beyond the dell itself, it gave way and he rolled down a brief declivity bearing with him in his way fragments of rock and heaps of smothering rubbish, ice, snow, and frozen pieces of bark that the wind had swept to a mass in the place, until he rested bruised and nearly senseless upon the brink of the river, which flowed without the barrier of forest and rock that bounded the glen, and from whose dark and crag-enshadowed bosom, it could not be discerned, as it flowed several feet lower. The pursuing half-breeds perceived not the accident, and passed on, and soon their screams of rage, and cries of determined murther were lost in the distance,—and the night and silence for a while reigned in the dreary wilderness. The fresh breeze that careered wantonly above the murmuring dash of the neighbouring waters, soon restored the half suspended faculties of Arnyte;—but had his trance been that of death itself, it must have been broken had it heard the hollow and thrilling yell as it were of more than mortal agony or wrath that greeted the astounded ear of the startled stripling a short space after he had recovered the effect of his sudden fall. He had partly raised himself from the earth, and confident in safety from the brutal ferocity of the half breeds, leaning on a broken piece of stone that had accompanied him in his descent from the acclivity above, he looked forth with an inquiring and scrutinizing eye that sought avidiously for some object of life and assistance in its desolation, upon the broad sheet of wave that stretched far out in the prospect before him. The shore was a waste extent of sand, interrupted by masses of grey stone that had fallen from the precipices above, and broken sometimes by deep and sinuous bays sinking far into their rocky hollows, and covered with shadow so that no light could penetrate their depth; though the whole wide surface of the water, for at least thirty yards from the beach, was one solid cake of ice, beyond which ran the dark and turgid current, the continuous spray leaping and bounding like a sea monster, in its race bearing aloft at times some fragment of its frozen wave, so that the faint moon smiled on the fantastic mass for a moment, ere by an undulation it would suddenly sink as swift as it had arisen, like a spectre among the abyss of waters of which it was the sport. Where the sight could reach by the lamp of the watery and weary stars, the land was a crowd of crag, desert and naked and dismantled forest, that frowned in gloom and dreariness, while the murmurs from the foaming river rolled through their bare and leafless trees—nor sign nor cheer unto the stripling's gaze of human aid was in that desolate and darksome scene of wild and solitude,—and faint, dejected and exhausted, by the labour of wo, travel, terror and weariness, for a moment he drooped as he bethought that he had but for a while shunned death— he had escaped the outlaw's ruthless knife, to perish by more lingering torments, the untended and unassisted sufferings of overpowered nature—and Arnyte with a dreadful shudder, half closed his eyes, sick with lassitude and despair, feeling as if to look around was a mockery, an exertion fruitless of hope—and deeming, as he closed his burning eyelids on the bleak view, that for a while he had shut out a portion of his misery;— and then nearly delirious with pain and wretchedness upon the clouded and troubled senses of the youth, debarred the sight of external objects by his darkened balls—there would throng for a time in wild and feverish array, dim and disturbing visions, which, though strange and indistinct, as dreams of the sick when dozing in broken sleep upon their midnight pillow, would rack his mind and startle his blood with resistless force; and he was fast sinking into that dull and misty lethargy of obtuse trance and suffering that the wounded experience in the lapses of seeming sleep and waking that follows the recovery of the death-like swoon that had left its victim amid the dead of the battle plain—when first the confused recollection of objects past—the turmoil of conflict of a night of death—the smart of pain endured, and the anticipation of suffering to commence, are all mingled on the throbbing though darksome brain; when that wild scream burst on his aroused hearing—he started, and with dilated eye, turned to the direction whence the hideous cry arose—it was not human voice that formed the sound; harsh, dissonant and shrill, it resembled the ferocious shriek of rage of a fierce and tameless animal. As Arnyte discerned the cause of that fearful noise, a sight of horror presented itself to his gaze—for a few 31 * yards distant from him, where the fractured course of the stream was obstructed by heaps of stone (whose frosted sides showed how savagely the waves had struggled for mastery over its enemy, to which the chill of winter had fastened it, as one who clings in death to a foe, tenacious of hate and conquest to the last,) there had been raised mounds of sand by the chafed and fretted tide, which having in vain spent its force against the rocks drove up the hollows formed by its own strength between these billocks until it made a kind of cove half wave half swamp, whose flow continued until the extremity was lost in the windings of the shore or the cavities of the line of higher land. This inlet though navigable for a canoe in summer, was now choked with snow, ice and mire. From the further side of the rivulet came that dismal howl, and thither as the cry was repeated, Arnyte looked. At first, his scrutiny was mocked by the intervening rise of sand, but soon his weakened sight descried wild shapes moving in rapid and heedless rout within the shadow of the shore, until beneath the very light of the moon, within a stone throw from him, half on the ice and half on the beach, rushed the spectacle of fear, a lean, gaunt, and monstrous wolf, hotly pursued by two of his savage fellows, his equals in strength, size and hideousness, whose rabid appetites appeared avaricious of a taste of his bloody prey, which (a human body) with his white and sharp fangs and claws, buried and cranched in his burden, he dragged along with him as he galloped from the hungry brutes that followed striving to tear the carcass from him,—and when the pursuers had gained upon him and fastened on his load, he would snatch the coveted prize from the struggling jaws of his baffled companions with horrible growls of rage and triumph, which were answered by fierce and ferocious yells of disappointment and anger, as with fresh impulse and spring the furious animals bounded on the flight of their greedy comrade. The glance of Arnyte that told his own danger, recognised in the mangled and bloody thing, for whose flesh the carnivorous beasts were so eagerly contending, the corpse of the half breed whom his hand had but a short time before destroyed, in accomplishing his escape. The terrific sight froze him powerless, and his life-blood curdled at his heart in horror;—he could not fly, but stood gazing on the bloody spectacle before him;—the foremost wolf, burthened with the lacerated body, was obliged at length to drop the prey and feed upon it with his fellows. Arnyte saw them rend limb from limb, growling with savage gratification the while, and grappling as they stripped the flesh from the bones for every mouthful, until their teeth and jaws ran blood and gore; and ever and anon in their revolting repast, as they peeled the skin and crunched the bones of the carcass, they would raise their long heads and fiery eyes towards the silent moon that shone upon their feast, and howl, bay and yell in fierce defiance at her march along the pallid heavens, until the hair upon the stripling's scalp rose on end, in the consciousness of his affright. Busily engaged at their meal, there had been time for Arnyte, unobserved by their quick sight, to have fled; for gloating and gorging on the corpse, at first they would not have cared to have left it, to follow his flight; but brief was the duration of their horrid banquet; with ravenous and rabid appetite, in few minutes they had devoured every morsel of flesh that had clothed the bones of the unfortunate half breed; his entrails were tore forth and dragged in strips and shreds between the fierce mouths of the ruthless animals;—eye and brain ran forth like water, as their strong teeth crashed the skull in atoms, and there was left alone a disgusting, formless heap of bones and blood, that had dropped from their eager jaws, to tell that which had once been a human form, endued with the thousand attributes of mortality; —and now the wolves had finished with their prey; so clean had they picked the skeleton, that scarce a gobbit remained for the birds of the air, whom the scent of the gore at the morning light would gather to the spot from their high eyries in the hills. And still Arnyte had not stirred one single step from the spot whereat he had first beheld that loathsome carnival on the dead: there he remained motionless, scarce like a thing of life and action, and yet he seemed to watch each horrid movement of the savage beasts, whose brutal howls rung on the ear of night, shaking with terror its stillness; but it was with eyes that looked like stone, and face that was marbled over with the whiteness of the shroud, while his nostrils dilated as in deadly pain, and his lower jaw had fallen in very horror, and his breath came heavy, thick and damp from his labouring chest, which heaved with convulsive throes, but of whose violence his stirless form and limbs appeared to be insensible:—there he was; a piece,—a lightning-scathed fragment of rock, cold and frozen unto very lifelessness, while the thought of all he risked by inaction and lingering thus until the chance of escape was passed seemed never to haunt or rouse him from his stupor; for to his sight the dead corpse of the half breed, as it was tossed, jerked and torn by the voracious wolves before him, looked ever and at times to be endued with horrid animation; and even in the distance and the night, he seemed to see it raise aloft towards the murderer, its threatening hand and its eyes unclosed upon him, with a ghastly stare ere they were forced from their sockets, and to the last, the fleshless mouth would mow, and gibber, and chatter with unearthly mockings at him;—his senses reeled in anguish,—his brows were hot as bathed with seething lead, and there were sparks of flame and moats of blood that swam before his eyes; and there followed a sudden darkness that covered his sight, as if in death; his heart panted heavily, and there were strange ringing sounds within his ears, and his very marrow seemed to curdle and freeze in his bones;—he felt as if he was sinking in the earth that had opened to receive him in a yawning abyss. The hoarse growl of the wolf who now bounded towards him, having left the carcass of the half breed, recalled the youth's departing sensation, and strength and perception were restored, while the wandering beam of his eye was fixed on the red and ferocious glance of the wild and ruthless animal, who sprang with all the savage haste of unsatiated hunger, whose appetite had been whetted by his late repast, towards his intended victim. There was but one of the wild beasts who had approached near to the stripling; the others yet lingered, and were still employed snapping angrily at each other with their blood-empurpled jaws as they tossed about and grovelled among the relics of their consumed repast, as reluctant to desert a bone while a gout of blood or flesh clung to its nakedness. The wild and flashing eye of the furious brute no sooner had marked the figure of the youth in the shadows of the surrounding night, than with pointed ear and gnashing tusks, and a sharp yell of ferocious pleasure, he trotted to attack him; and the first consciousness of the hazard in which he was placed was awakened in the breast of Arnyte, as the tameless brute had couched upon his haunches to give force to the leap wherewith he prepared to pounce upon his unequal antagonist: to meet with his fainting powers the assault of his gaunt and unsparing enemy with chance of successful issue, or to turn and seek safety in swiftness against the long, sure, and untiring gallop of the sinewy beast, with his wearied and worn frame, were alike vain and desperate; and though even against all fearful odds the conquest of this one adversary were given him, what would preserve him from the maws of his companions, who lagged behind him, when they should join in the pursuit; and then too the pack to which these stragglers belonged were in the neighbourhood, for the dismal howls that by times were repeated with a clearness and distinct force that belied all echo, bespoke the perils of an encounter with a vast troop of the rabid animals to be not unlikely meeting for the fugitive. Yet mustering himself for a last effort, like the dying swimmer, when the waves that are dashing about him seem grasping at him to hold him back from the shore and overwhelm him in death, he hurled the tomahawk which he had taken from the girdle of the slain half breed, at his terrific enemy—but with blinded, rash, and uncertain aim; he awaited not the fate of the blow, but endeavoured to make his flight, and dashed along the unknown shore; the hoarse and enraged howl of his brutal foe told how false had been the course of the weapon, of which he had so madly deprived himself;—onwards he strained with agonized strength,—the howling beast was behind him,— closer and closer came that horrid yell, and he heard the very pattering of the wolf upon the hard ground o'er which, but a minute before, his own foot had fled; the wretched fugitive with desperate bounds flung himself forward, but a giant fresh in strength would scarce have escaped such pursuer; there was no chance to favour one so enfeebled by his late encounters as the unfortunate stripling;—breathless and panting with useless toil, big damp drops of fear and exertion started on his aspen visage, which was livid with the hue of utter despair; his pace was uncertain and reeling as he strove to stagger onward, and his step seemed laggard and faint, as benumbed and paralyzed by disease—the ferocious beast was on him, with a roar maddening to the mind, and stunning to the ear—his sharp claws were fixed upon his garment, ripping the flesh and starting the blood,—the horrid gore-encrimsoned mouth of the brute hung on his shoulder, the very breath of the savage animal came on his cheek like the breeze that bears the plague from the lazaretto; the wolf had sprung and fastened with tooth and fang upon the floating dress of Arnyte, his hind paws remained on the earth; he was dragged along, while his prey struggled to burst from the threatened bite of his distended jaws; the fierce and fiery eyes of the beast blazed with rage at the faint and vain contest to avoid his hold, and with a ferocity that seemed exhaustless, he snapped at his victim with his sharp teeth, ere he was well within their reach— “God!” cried the desolate and hopeless youth, as he shrunk from the grasp of his ruthless enemy, while a cry of horror rose to his trembling and livid lip; and his blood seemed frozen and congealed at his heart, and his limbs grew weaker and weaker, and shook beneath him, and he felt himself sinking to the earth, though striving to the last, like the wreck of a gallant ship that endeavours to ride the foam and wave that fast swallows it down in destruction,— with a wild, convulsive effort, to keep back his brutal assailant, as he fell to the earth, nearly unconscious of what he did, Arnyte thrust forth his hand against the chest of the ferocious animal, as if in the unprotected member there was defence against the attack of the gaunt wolf, like one that would screen himself from an avalanche that totters above him when too late to retreat from its impending death:—at that moment,—that fearful moment of fate and despair, there was a sound,—a loud, quick, sharp noise; it came to the ear of the youth like the rolling thunder over the stormy sea to the gasping and drowning mariner, whom the waves are raging to engulf; and at the instant, a dark and gory form bounded above him, spattering him with blood; and a yell that might have awakened death itself followed; and at the same time, a cry,—a human cry of life and triumph was heard by the fainting stripling at his side: the first had been the report of the discharge of a rifle, and the wolf lay beyond Arnyte wounded to death, still snapping and biting in his dying agonies against the void and unembodied air, while amidst the darkness that clouded eye and brain, young Leisler beheld a figure bending above him; but when he endeavoured to distinguish it clearer, and to speak, he could only faintly toss his strengthless frame, as his voice sank into a low and indistinct mutter, and he became senseless; every power of his overwrought body and wearied spirit, exhausted and overcome by his sufferings. The swoon in which Arnyte had fallen did not continue long, for the person who had thus been the means of his rescue from such perilous danger, with powerful force as he would have raised a child, lifted up the almost lifeless form of young Leisler, and bore it across the ice to a canoe from which he had landed; and then he pushed with swift paddle his barque in the middle of the stream, alarmed by the pursuit of the wolves, the whole troop of whom the dying screams of their companion had called around him, and who followed with wild yell and howl the track of his destroyer, to the very edge of the water, where they paused and stood in a tumultuous band, gazing on the pirogue, as it flew like a star along the river beyond their attack, with furious eyes and dreadful cries, that sounded like mingled shrieks of rage and baffled hunger, as their prey was carried from their sight. His rescuer having bathed brow and temple with the cold and reviving drops which he snatched from the limpid waves on which they floated, soon was enabled by careful tendance, to recall motion to the stark limbs, and saneness to the bewildered mind of the stripling, although at first it was with difficulty, that the heavy lids that dropped over his eyes, nearly blind and visionless from all the terrors they so late had looked upon, were unclosed, and sight regained its force, and his breast, ere it renewed its healthful heavings, laboured hard with many a harrowing groan and painful sigh. And when at length young Leisler turned to look upon his preserver, an involuntary exclamation of surprise and wonder, broke from him in his astonishment of renewed vision and intellect. The wild attire and well known features of his devoted Indian follower, who had borne so useful and kind a part in the escape from Kid and his lawless band from the ruined forest hut, were revealed to his eyes by the clear and vivid light of the moon as it fell upon the wave, and the restless canoe in which they floated. It was the White Skinned Beaver, that had saved his life in its direst extremity. After the first flow of his grateful feelings had subsided somewhat to calmness, Arnyte learnt from the friendly salvage, in answer to his many eager inquiries, that after having parted company subsequent to the miserable overthrow of the Leislerian family, when Arnyte had set forth determined to attain admittance to his father's dungeon and share its miseries, that goaded by his own fears and the unceasing alarm of the unhappy mother of the youth, whose disturbed mind and seared heart, shrunk from the whisperings of her wretchedness, that foreboded a double bereavement in the destruction of husband and child, from the continued and delayed absence of the stripling, from whom there came no tidings, he had set forth in search of him. He had traced him to the Stadthuis, and there for awhile, his pursuit had ended in doubt; but the lips of all were busied with the condemnation of Leisler, and the thread of his route was soon discovered, that had conducted him to the homestead of colonel Bayard. Here, by an accidental chance in overhearing a discourse among the menials who had been present, the red man was informed of the treacherous conduct of Bayard, and of his now being carried off in captivity by the half-breeds, whose trail, without guide or direction, he sought to follow; but in vain did he endeavour to track their steps; and in despair, as with a late effort, he took to the canoe and coasted along the shore of the Hudson, in hopes that by the smooth course of the river, he might the swifter be carried to some place fortunate for heading their route, or that he might intercept them, should they cross with their prisoner to the opposite shore from the Manahadoes, if either of such were their course of journey; and while proceeding up the broad and turgid stream of the river of mountains with such intention, he had happily been attracted by the hazard of Arnyte, to his deliverance, and to the slaying of the ravenous wolf, whose claw and fang had so nearly accomplished his fate. With the very first emotions of joy for his own singular rescue from harm, there mingled the thought and anxiety in the breast of Arnyte for his imprisoned parent; for even to the last, in spite of its improbability, he had cherished, and yet beguiled himself with a latent hope, that the malevolence of Bayard, however ungenerous and villanous, as used against himself, had not been directed to the same extent towards his father; and he sought but with firm endeavour in his own conduct and life, for a cause or pretext, that the inveterate hate of the foeman of his house should be urged the more determinate and desperate against himself, than against another person of his race. No certain information could be given by the Indian, of that which was sought of him concerning Leisler; though at the name, he shook his head with mournful motion, and confessed to the anxious youth, that what was intimated by report and rumour, such as in his passage through the crowds of the Stadt in seeking for him he had heard, were presages of gathering evil that were thickened round his devoted head like a cloud of arrows, from whose barbed points there was no shield or defence for asfety. And Vol. II. 32 while listening to the words of the salvage, the very soul of Arnyte was excited to frenzy; and with the wild prayers of one almost maniac, he begged the Indian to exert the canoe to the utmost speed, that he might reach the city ere the first dawn of day. The Indian, with redoubled exertions, replied to the stripling's entreaties, who, at length, yielding to his weariness and sufferings, was prevailed on, after assurances that no effort at swiftness should be relaxed, to stretch himself on the bottom of the barque, where, covered by the red man's blanket, he was soon wrapt in slumbers that refreshened and revived him; while obedient to the lusty stroke of the paddle, the canoe cut the flashing waves, and swam the hissing waters like a bird breasting the gladsome air.—On went the barque; before its rushing prow, in sparkling crests, the broken tides ran flashing round; the waters kissed the little vessel's heaving sides, and dropt upon its deck like dew the lion shakes from off his flowing mane. The moon, in pale and midnight glory, looked down upon their voyage, and its festal radiance lighted the livid flakes that shot upon the crowned waves with envious pageantry; —on flew the pirouge with a falcon's flight, and the white foam tossed and raved as it went, like a steed that battles against the rider it must obey; and on its arrowy course, wave tumbled after wave, like the wild disorder of the spears of an armed host in the confusion of the conflict—headland after headland, darksome glade, lone crag, and bristling rock, that girdled the shore past which the barque bounded, faded in its course in deeper gloom, till far behind they lay in undistinguishable and tintless masses, covered in mist, night, and darkness. The Indian, with unwearied arm, plied his monotonous task, and urged his fragile vessel onwards in its course, though ever and anon, as he drove at his labour, he would bend himself with a noiseless motion over the sleeping youth, watching with anxious gaze his slumber, and as a mother guards her babe in rest, he would tend with gentle action to his comfort. “Sleep, wearied one,” he chaunted, as he pushed his canoe along the restless tide, while his voice echoed o'er the far wave like the soothing breeze that bends the tall tops of a summer forest—“Sleep, wearied one! When the red hatchet is buried in the earth, And the Sachems smoke the calumet of peace, The miscaws[27] [27] Indian banners. of the nation are carried In the Council Wigwam by the squaws, No breeze wakens them to war— Like the sleep of peace, rest thee, wearied one! The bird of the Great Spirit, with its purple plume, Hovers with a song above the blanket On which rests the brave, who take many scalps in battle; And the doves that come from the south, the land of souls, Wing o'er the leafy roof of his wigwam, To guard his couch from the Evil Spirit and the fierce Huron— Like the brave who take many scalps in battle, rest thee, wearied one! Like the damp and sickly vapours, That bears death to the breast they heat, And are gathered from the marshy pools of the great swamp, Are the dark shadows that haunt the dreams of him who walks The crooked paths his nation know not, The paths that lead to the lair of the panther; Like a couch of leaves In which a serpent hides, Is the bed of him whose back is to the cries of his people, Whose tongue is bitter, for his words are false in deceitfulness. The stones of light of the Manitoe,† † Manitoe Aseniah, or Spirit stones.—Vide M`Kenzie's Journal. Are as white as the snow flakes that melt On the ruffled wave of the great lake; As lovely as the stones of the Manitoe, Are the forms which smile in the dreams Of the warrior who dies for his tribe, And hath his place on the Manataulan.‡ ‡ The island of Spirits. Sweet as the dreams of the warrior, Who dies in the battles of his tribe, Dream thou wearied one!—Rest thee, wearied one! Ere the weight of his slumbers departed from his aching brows and Arnyte had collected as it were the last remains of his strength and spirits, to sustain which hope had almost deserted him, to look upon that which he deemed the last unwinding of his woof of wo and troubles—the fate of Leisler! A line of golden light, the advancing herald of the uprising sun, flickered the eastern horizon, and was reflected on the dark bosom of the river o'er which the pirouge laboured, and the top of hill and crag caught the coming ray, while the mists of night, in rude and massy folds, like a curtain rolled before the flood of gorgeous glory, that fast broadened, and brightened in the heavens;—for a time, the dense cloud lay like an ocean, whose depths are impierceable, then sluggishly and reluctant, as tides flow back from the beach, it broke away in bands, thinned and faded like the relics of a battle, until not a wreck of its retreat remained, and in the day,—promontory, steep and river bank, sweeping shore and upland precipice, lay clear and plain, basking and sparkling in the young splendours of the new born morning; and now the river's course grew wider and more lordly, deepening as towards a majestic bay, while the floating blocks of ice, that had many times during the past night encountered the slight canoe in its voyage, threatening its destruction, sailed by less often and hugged the coves and shores, in whose recesses, like fleets, huge masses heaved on the water's swelling surface, blazing and flashing in the sunbeams like gems of price, and shunning to contest with the stronger current of the centre stream, o'er which they delayed, until midwinter's help to spread their triumph.—Calm, beautiful, and magnificent was the sight of the borders of the river from the barque, as it bounded merrily onward; here the dark and frowning forest, its paths choaked with wild underwood of every hue, shape and species; its bands of leafless and discoloured trees, mournful in autumnal desolation, expanded wide and loftily; now close and interminable, anon opening in fantastic glades, where, although the view was through a very fretwork of intricate and interlacing boughs, that mocked ingenuity to disentwine or to trace, could be caught glimpses of the more open country, vast and uncultivated fields, brown and bare, except where detached sheets of snow still adhered to the earth in defiance of wind and sun; there frowned down on the water's edge, terraces of rock, barren and savage, the battlements of nature, whose stern ramparts seemed by the foot of living man never to have been trodden, for about them was nor sign nor cultivation, that bespoke their invasion by thing of life;—while again, for they approached the settlements, perched amid the most inaccessible cliffs, was often descried, like the nest of some mountain bird, the woodman or the hunter's cabin, rude as the hill which it crowned, engirdled, and apparently pathless in its loneliness, with wild crag and tree, the monarch of the peak, where humanity contended with the wolf and panther for its dwelling place;—close to the brink of the stream, the dun deer, in undisturbed troops wandered, bounding gracefully and tossing their branching antlers in the air, and bending at the passing canoe their large eyes with an aspect, meek, beautiful, and fearless, as they looked on man as a friend rather than an enemy;—afar off, some early and solitary boat was seen making its way upon the unbridled wave, the forms that guided it, indistinct in distance, while a white sail, like the wings of a bird, upon the utmost verge of sky and water, would at times wake then disappear to the eye; all was a scene to gaze on in delight, as the rich and vivid tints of sky were mirrored in wave, mount, and valley, peradventure unfelt the cold breeze of a winter morning. But by Arnyte, unmarked were all the beauties of the dawn; but one object engrossed his sight and soul, one overwhelming thought swallowed up all pleasure with dire misfortune; he gazed not on the magnificence of untutored nature, for dark and fearful visions of danger and death swam before his eye, and a sound had broke on his hearing, mingling with his dreams and startling him from his sleep; a sound that racked and tortured his listening ear and froze his heart strings, and stopped the warm courses of his blood in terror; it was the low, melancholy and dismal tollings of a bell, a mournful funeral sound, too soon recognized by the unfortunate youth, as proceeding from the belfry of the Gereformede Kirk of the city of Nieuw Amsterdam, within sight of whose high and sloping roofs, and tall chimneys, that clustered like a bundle of shafts, that ornament the pillars of a cathedral, the barque that bore 32* the stripling and his Indian friend rapidly wended;—as the canoe neared the city, more hollow and fearful seemed the toll of the bell, and although Arnyte well knew it was the custom of the Court Messenger, whenever any member of the Kerk expired, to sound the mournful requiem, yet the early hour,—for funerals were at mid-day; the stillness which seemed to hover over the town, and the silence with which nature itself was embound;—for voice nor hum, nor noise of busy life interfered with that awful and tremendous peal of death, at once paralyzed and appalled him; every stroke of the bell, maddened his brain, and struck like a dagger to his soul, and from its solemn echoes his heavy heart foreboded evil and the direst misery that distracted thought could picture: he desired eagerly to touch the land and yet feared to know the worst that might await his arrival—and when at last the barque struck the shore, he stirred nor moved not, but as transfixed and bound with horror to his place, he sat for a time, even as first he had heard that dreadful burial note. The dock, the ways and streets, were deserted as far as could be seen up their rude and irregular lines; for in those days upon the road (for being unpaved the streets could scarce be otherwise called) the houses were placed with little care or order, their porches, abutments and stoebs, jutting out so far, that each house seemed to vie with the other in the disorder of its position, so as after the distance of a few yards to wholly intercept the sight;—and besides, as each burgher in erecting his mansion, followed at once his own convenience and taste, in defiance of all rule of civic regulation and architecture, allowing the nature of the ground its sway, (it being reserved for the wisdom of modern surveyors to torture and level to a dead flat plain, a counterpart of their own brains, a spot whose native beauties were beyond compare, until blasted by the unskilful hand of art.) the gable ends of one cluster of dwellings, were close in the passage way, while others, owing to a sudden rise of the ground, (the builder loving the shade of the hills) were many feet behind it, and having the fronts in a very different direction, so that the streets were twisted and turned in their course, with the contortions of a serpent. A dreadful stillness, save the bell, seemed to rest upon the whole city. All around was lonely and desolate. Few or none were seen moving, and those distantly and in haste, along the deserted ways. It seemed like some vast hive, whose noisy inhabitants were abroad leaving none to tenant their vacant homes. One single person, a maimed and loathsome mendicant, festering in squalidness, and writhing in misery in the rising light of the sun, put forth his tattered hat for alms with a querulous muttered benison towards Arnyte, as followed by his savage companion, he entered the Stadt. “Master, for God's sake, give me a stuyver to get bread,” quoth the lazar, “pity me, master, I am old, lame and weak, and cannot, like you who are in health, drag my limbs to the kommins, to behold the execution of the traitor Jacobus Leisler: troth, all the world are at the sight save me. What ails thee, master?” concluded the beggar abruptly, as Arnyte bent himself as stricken by a blow, and reeled forward, while his visage was of the ashen colour of the dead—and had it not been for the supporting arm of the Indian, he would have sank unto the ground. In a moment the force of the shock was past—for this, although his heart believed it not, yet his fears foreboded. He struggled and essayed to speak to the startled mendicant, but his lips failed to frame the question he would have sought, and he stood all pale and still, with eyes dilated and wild, gazing on the affrighted and astounded lazar, as one that knew not what he did or looked upon. “Why do you linger here Mienheers? the prisoner has been already taken from the Stadthuis. I heard the sound of the kettle drums of the Hoofdt-wag that guard him, as they passed through the city land poorte. Hasten, or you will lose the sight, Mienheers,” exclaimed a voice rapid and sudden in its utterance. It was a burgher who rushed by, and even as he spoke, his steps died away in the distance which he hastily traversed. The words caught the ear of Arnyte; a thousand thoughts, such as haunt the breast of the wretched, though all indistinct and helpless, and without refuge, yet for the moment, with the force of a giant upholding the sufferer, rushed through the stripling's heart. “I will save him—he shall be saved!” he shrieked, and he rushed from the place where he had been stayed by the mendicant's appeal, with a step so wild and quick, that the red man could scarce keep pace with his rapidity. On through the city he passed—the gate that opened towards the kommins was left behind him—none obstructed or noticed him, for the soldiers had quitted their stations, and had followed the crowd to the scaffold. Onwards he pushed, careless of the rude and broken path, on which, at another moment, his footing had been difficult. Soon crowds of people hurrying to the horrid spectacle of death, clogged his road. There were old men, with hair white with age, and eyes too dim for such a sight as they now thirsted to encounter; there were tender matrons with their infants at their breasts, clinging in love and beauty, yet eager to gaze upon the death of a fellow creature, as they were bearing their children to some holiday pageant—there were troops of school-boys let loose from the desk and form gamboling at heartless sport as they swelled the herd of spectators—and the timid maiden that would at another moment have dropped in sickness from the lusty arm of love that tended on her tread—that would have wept at the expiring throes of a gentle bird, now in gayest garb and visage rich in smiles, joined the throng impatient to gaze upon a scene of blood—Arnyte broke distractedly through the ranks that impeded his progress, while those whom he thrust aside turned on him in anger or sorrow as they recognized the child of the ill-fated Leisler—and now the the kommins lay before him;—it was a beautiful and extended plain gently descending on the eastern and western sides towards the Hudson and the oost vloed, while at the other extremities rose dark granite rocks and hills, while here and there along its borders (and now and then a clump would intrude into the plain itself) grew little forests of hazle-wood and the ever-green fir—all the wide plain was thronged with the multitude whose numbers seemed fast to increase; every site, knoll, rock, and tree were alive with human beings, all striving for a nearer approach to the grim scaffold that rose from amid the dark and crowded mass of heads that like a tossing sea surrounded it, like a huge and gloomy spectre. Arnyte was yet far distant from the fatal spot, and as he endeavoured to pierce the almost impenetrable barrier of human bodies that were before him, he grew almost mad with the murmurs of the crowd through which he strove to make his way;—he laboured and strained until with toil and exertion the drops of sweat and blood coursed down his cheeks like water, and his face became black and convulsed—he beheld dimly defined forms moving on the scaffold—there was one on which his eye rested a moment ere it grew dull and dim; he strove to cry out—to shout, that he might delay but for the instant the fatal preparation, but in vain,—his tongue was parched as with fire and his lips glued in horror, and his heart seemed as if it were burst in twain.—Yet this lasted but a minute; an age was in that minute! with the frantic energy of a demoniac he shouted, and his voice rolled over the crowd, who were in awful silence gazing on the sad spectacle before them: broke through their astonished ranks—he sprang to the foot of the dismal scaffold —there was a sudden and hollow sound, and then a groan cleaved the air, and the stripling's garments were ensanguined with his father's blood—a cold, electric shiver ran through his frame, as a gory head, beard and lock, dripping with the red rain, and eye and lip yet quivering quick and convulsive, as in pain and death, flashed clear and ghastly on his sight; his veins seemed to flood unto his heart, as his eye met the dreadful object; he would have shrieked, but it were vain; the imperfect cry rose to his throat—it was choaked in agony; reason seemed to have fled him, and a blank void was on his brain; the heads of the crowd grinned, glared and mowed at him like fiends; all grew confused, and a wild burst of laughter broke from him—it was the very weakness of his brain;—and he fell upon the heaving and headless trunk that lay before him, whose still gushing veins slaked the dust with blood. The executioner's harsh voice was heard above the sighs of the crowd, that rose like the murmur of many waters, as he uplifted, with hand buried ruthless in the dishevelled hair, to the view of the multitude, the bleeding and cadaverous head of his victim, exclaiming in a loud tone,— “Lo! the head of Jacobus Leisler! the head of a foul, disloyal traitor!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An Explanatory Postscript. It were not in my nature, most affable and gentle reader, to leave matters in so melancholious a plight as that wherewith the aforegoing narration concludeth. Albeit it were a violation of poetic justice as well as the truth of historie, not to undeceive thee as to the events in conclusion, which although at the period in fact, as appears by the death of Leisler, turned out most unfortunate and dolorous for his descendant,—nathless, after recovering from the shock wherewith it was natural the young man should be stricken by his parent's dreadful fate, it appears, from my researches in the chronicles and records of the time, that he carried unto King William, at Whitehall, a complaint against the false faith of Governor Sloughter; and although at first, from reasons of state policy, the king was unwilling to reverse the condemnation and attainder of the unfortunate man, nathless, he was induced by Queen Mary, who was greatly pleased with the filial piety of the stripling, to order the estates of Milbourne and Leisler to be restored unto their families, as objects of their majesties' mercy; and albeit at length, through the assiduous endeavours of his son, the act of attainder was reversed by parliament, and a bill was passed by the assembly of New-Yorke, on the recommendation of a letter from the Lord Jersey, by order of the king, levying one thousand pounds as a remuneration for the expenditures of Leisler in forwarding the revolution; and the dead body of the sufferer was taken up and interred with great pomp, in the old Dutch Church in the city of New-Yorke. And it is asserted by a veracious historian, that “the posterity of Leisler are rather dignified in public estimation than disgraced, by the fate of their ancestor.” It is not to be supposed that Nicholas Bayard was greatly pleased at the turn of affairs, relative to the family of his adversary; in truth, he was so transported with anger thereat, that he violently opposed the measures of the colonial government, whose feelings had changed with the times against him, and by his violent and imprudent proceedings, he became amenable to the very similar charges to those he had instigated against Leisler; but in his adversity he was no way blessed, like his opponent, with the kind tendance of filial love; seeing when he was condemned for high treason, under a statute which by his means had been enacted for the purpose of assisting Leisler's destruction, he sent word upto his only son, that one thousand pounds would save his life, cold-hearted person returned for answer,—“that it was too much money, and it would make him a beggar, and it was better the father should die than the son starve!” And it was but by a fortuitous chance that Nicholas Bayard escaped the rope he so well deserved. Neither was there an expiation wanting, as historie doth accurately detail, in the fate of Governor Henry Sloughter, in regard to his weak conduct towards the Leisler family; for after a short, weak, and turbulent administration of a few months, he died most suddenly: and some there were, who, recollecting his imbecility in the affair of Leisler, made no secret of their thoughts, that his mind was tortured and miserable in his hour of death; and those who feared or disliked the Bayards, rumoured fearful things, that the governor came unfairly to his end; and although the surgeons opened his body, by orders of the council, suspicion was not silenced; his remains were interred in Stuyversant's vault, on the Bouwerie, next to those of the old Dutch governor of that name; and although the last hath a pompous epitaph describing his dignities, which is to be read unto this day, the miserable Sloughter moulders unremembered, and unwept. The pirate Kid likewise came to an untimely end, being, after the commission of many horrid enormities, taken and sent to England by Lord Bellamont, the new governor of New-Yorke, and was there tried for piracy and murder, and being found guilty, he was executed at Execution dock, in the year 1701. Thus, friendly peruser, by my means thou hast the sequel of the fates of the prominent personages of the narrative, concerning which, if of moment to thy mind, thou wouldst have remained ignorant but for my labours and investigations thereon; and albeit, though I take no pride beyond a modest and conscious desert therefor, there seemeth much truth in the maxim of the Dutch poet and philosopher, who saith— Niemand kan binden den waarhied, Wie zien niet want heta met wyshied. Which I have placed in an English version to the following purpose:— The truth remains in darkest night, Unless by wisdom brought to light. Ter. Phlog. FINIS.</field>
