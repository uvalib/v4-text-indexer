      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The following volume is printed from the manuscript without the alteration of a sentence or word. How this manuscript got into the possession of him who makes it public, is matter of private history, which it interests not the reader to know; or which, if it does, circumstances that the editor is not at liberty to explain, prevent him from making known. The manuscript, with the title precisely as it is given, came into his hands rolled up in the subjoined letter. Baltimore, September, 1833. “Ashridge, May 23d, 1833. “My Dear Young Friend: “Do you recollect when you were last with us, you asked me, on occasion of my describing some of the scenes of my youthful days, to give you a chapter from my early life? If you have forgotten your request and my promise to comply with it, the accompanying manuscript will remind you of both, and at the same time of the proverb—“Give him an inch and he will take an ell.” A short time after you left us, I one day got Alfred to make me some good pens, and taking a sheet of his large school paper, that I might have “room and verge enough,” I sat down to fulfil my promise. I soon found myself at the end of the sheet with my chapter unfinished, and 1* what I had written appearing to me very meager. The effort, however, created an interest in the occupation. Half-buried recollections with their trains of association rose up. The motives of pleasure and curiosity added themselves to the simple purpose of keeping my word to you. The design of enveloping fact in fiction grew out of them. I resolved to give you half a dozen chapters instead of one; and here you have the result of this resolve in the form of a volume—and an exemplification of the growth of great things out of small. When I tell you, that the task of writing it has afforded me much pleasure, I know I furnish you with a motive to bear patiently the task of reading it. My wife, too, has been highly amused with the productions of “my book,” as she calls it. She has indeed contributed to it. The proper names are all testimonials of her genius for fiction. She claims to have supplied, besides, useful hints, and even to have made several important corrections: most of these claims, however, are questionable. You will be wrong if you ascribe to her any portion of my character. I alone am answerable for the liberties which in that picture fiction has taken with fact. Whatever difficulty you may have in discerning the proportions in which they are mingled, you will have none when I tell you that you have a sincere friend in Herbert Barclay. “P. S. How soon shall we see you again in this part of Maryland? Alfred asks often when you are coming back. His partiality for you is owing chiefly, I believe, to his triumphs over you in geography.”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. —“Had I observed that Herbert's natural dispositions exposed him to be particularly injured by pursuing this course, I should not have permitted him to pursue it. Respect for his father's injunctions would have yielded to regard for his welfare. Indeed, in disregarding such injunctions from such a motive, I should have felt, that I was doing a duty towards my brother himself, as well as towards my nephew. But Herbert, has, I think, lost less by the imperfections of education, than most young persons lose. He has run smoothly over the customary course, learning the little that can be learnt in it, with such readiness, that acquisition has not been to him an irksome labor, nor absence from his teachers, liberation from prison. He has none of the disgust for study, which is so often the strongest impression brought away from school. Besides, with the will and opportunity, a young man of twenty can, in a great measure, make up for early deficiencies.” “Herbert has, too, his mother's enthusiasm.” “Yes: and enthusiasm is the wings of life, that take from the weight of its heaviest burdens. The light-headed are often borne away by it to dizzy heights; but in Herbert, there is solidity enough to balance its buoyancy.” “Had your brother reversed the provisions of his will, and given you over his son the control he gave you over his property, he would have charged you with a more suitable duty and provided more wisely for his son. With his high estimation of you, it was singular that he should have undertaken to prescribe himself for twelve years after his death for Herbert's education.” “Far stronger, Elizabeth, than individual opinion, is the force of custom. In my brother's conduct spoke the voice of the multitude. He was a strict conformist to established usage. This was to him law—so sacred, that he suffered no personal partiality to infringe it. He did not think for himself in such matters; and he was therefore incapable of appreciating the consequences of doing so in others. Divergence from the general opinion was in his view an unprofitable eccentricity: he could not realize that it might be a step forward. Esteem for me, so far from gaining consideration for my theoretical opinions, he turned to account against them; and in his last moments it was a source of comfort to him, that in my promise to carry into effect the plan he laid down, he could rely against the temptations of my own principles.” “The further guidance of Herbert,—so far as he may need or be willing to be guided,— devolves now by your brother's own wish upon you”— “And therein again is apparent the same influence that controlled him in making provision for Herbert's instruction. Tuition at an expensive public school, and after that four years in the classes of a college—and the education of a young man is completed! My brother was satisfied that he had done all he could do—all that could be done, in securing this to his son. And had he lived to see how successfully Herbert has passed through the gradation, he would have believed that there is not in the world a better educated young man! And had I told him that on the play ground, from his college amusements and relaxation, Herbert had learnt more that is available in life than in the school room and college halls—more from his class-mates than from his class-teachers, he would have laughed at me. And yet, so it is. A Roman galley is as well suited to navigate the Atlantic,—a monk's library of the middle ages, as serviceable for scientific acquirement,—an ancient war-chariot, as fitted to oppose flying artillery, as is the scholastic system of education to prepare youth for the performances of manhood. This system is at once arduous and barren: it is like a hickory nut,—hard to crack, and nearly all shell. Its machinery is as unwieldy as it is weak, encumbering without moving the young powers. Its effects are as superficial as its operation is laborious. It does not reach the swelling roots of the nascent faculties; it merely encrusts them with a shallow layer of verbal learning, which, far from fertilizing them, obstructs their healthful development. Often have I observed,— when Herbert has been with us in his vacations,—the spontaneous movement of his mind to which education ought to give elasticity and boldness, checked by the habitual pressure of heavy forms.” “The few weeks in each year he has spent with us, were times of such full enjoyment to him, that he returns with the happiest anticipations. In coming to live with us, he feels that he comes to his home. Did you observe how his countenance sparkled with gladness yesterday when he burst in upon us on his arrival? “Yes: he has a warm and happy disposition.”— It was towards the end of September 18—, that Mr. and Mrs. Barclay were thus engaged in conversation. The room in which they were sitting was furnished with simplicity. A few busts and pictures gave to it that air of refined luxury which tasteful productions of the fine arts always diffuse around them. On one side, two windows reached the floor, through which the eye rested on a rich verdure of sward and foliage. About thirty acres expanded before the house, gently sloping towards the south in graceful undulation to a body of forest, whose tall trees, running irregularly in front and at the sides of the lawn, completely enclosed it, and bounded the view. A few majestic remnants of the primitive forest, scattered over 2 the open ground, deepened the verdure with their broad shadows. Near the walls on either side, rose from the turf the huge trunks of several oaks, the offspring of ages. These did not,—like their brothers beyond, as if in rivalry of aspiring neighbors,—shoot up with clean stems high into the air; but, early disengaged from the vicinity of other trees, they had expanded broadly over the earth, sending out, at a few feet above their roots, gnarled branches which stretched afar their brawny limbs—sturdy kings of the forest, that looked in their freshness, as if they still grew in vigor, mocking time and rejoicing in the tempest. The sun was declining, imparting as it approached the horizon, by the contrast of light and shadow from its oblique rays, a livelier picturesqueness to the lovely scene. This effect was heightened by the irregular projections from the body of the wood, one side of them glowing with golden light, while the other had already put on and cast beside it on the ground a deep shade, giving to the retreating recesses that mysterious indistinctness, which a great writer has cited, as a fit image of what is called in literature, the romantic, as distinguished from the classical. To the right of the house, one of these withdrawing openings, which seemed to invite the beholder to explore them, led through the trees up a considerable elevation, on reaching which, a wide prospect met the eye. At about two miles distant was spread out a large city, covering, as all American cities do, a great extent of surface, and, with its straggling suburbs, presenting no defined outline. On its furthest side lay, half embraced by it, a mass of water, whose still bosom reflected softly the red beams of the sun. The position of the neighboring grounds gave to the water from this point the appearance of a lake, although the tall masts of ships bore evidence of a deep outlet to the sea. The prospect extended far around over a cultivated country, and terminated on the right and south in wooded ridges, and on the left, in low grounds which marked the course of the river. Returning from the spot whence this extensive and diversified scene was beheld, to the wood-inclosed lawn, was like suddenly passing from a crowded street into the stillness of one's dwelling. The exterior of the house corresponded with the simple beauty around it and the taste within. It was of moderate size and without pretension. The art of its design manifested itself in the pleasing impression produced, while the means by which it was produced were so skilfully disposed and mingled as not to give prominence to any individual architectural element; unlike many buildings which ambitiously court notice by the display of some one outward characteristic of art, and, intended to be fine specimens of architecture, are in reality offensive monuments of ostentatation. The conversation of Mr. and Mrs. Barclay, was interrupted by the approach of its subject who galloped up to the door. “Well, Herbert, you have returned early,” said his uncle, who went out to meet him. “Yes, sir,” said Herbert, as they walked into his house. “Mr. Grey was not at his office: I saw him only for a moment after I had started to come out. He made me promise to spend the day with him to-morrow.” “He has wished your return almost as much as we have, Herbert,” said Mr. Barclay. “Alfred Grey will be a friend whom I am sure you will delight in. He has half a dozen years the start of you in life, and will be often able to give you a helping hand better than we old people, for he is fresh from the ground you are about entering on.” “He will not help you, however, to partners at a dance,” said Mrs. Barclay. “He is not a frequenter of large companies.” “I am provided in that way already,” said Herbert, “I met Mr. Seldon, who offered me a seat in his carriage for every ball I should wish to go to”— 2* “He must have turned over a new leaf lately; for he has always confined himself to a small circle. But I suppose, in making you this offer, he meant, all that were worth going to.” “While I was talking to him,” continued Herbert, “Dr. Walsall came up and greeted me very cordially, and begged me to make a convenience of his table whenever I wanted a dinner.” “Ah! that's a valuable invitation,” said Mr. Barclay. “The doctor, Herbert, keeps the best cook in town.” In playful familiar conversation the three passed a happy evening; Herbert, in the joyousness of youthful spirits, and Mr. and Mrs. Barclay, in the warm pleasure of kindly sympathy, and almost parental tenderness, which his presence awakened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. Herbert was at that age when the present is all in all. Experience has not taught its lessons of forethought: the mind has not yet worn itself a channel for a continuous course, but overflows in sudden unconnected impulses: young memory carries no burden— imagination sees no obstacle: the past is a dream—the future a vision. To Herbert the world appeared a plain, over which he could course at will;—the area where the movements of his mind were to pass into easy actions. As he rode into town the next day, no object sparkling in the sunshine felt its warmth more genially than he did. Although looking forward to happy hours, he was not impatient to arrive; but he rode slowly along in the enjoyment of undefined feelings: the sense of existence was a full pleasure. His situation left him nothing to desire. His uncle and aunt had no children: he was to them the object of parental instinct: in their house he enjoyed the affection and the freedom of a home. The future lay before him as inviting as the town towards which he rode. On his entrance into the city, his musings and vague sensations gave place to a more lively pleasure. The noises and sights of a busy town, have an animating effect even upon those who are daily accustomed to them. The activity of perception required by the variety of objects is enlivening: the mere passer-by catches from the crowd some of that cheerfulness which occupation always communicates: there is, too, on every side, much that is directly designed to attract the beholder. This moving scene acted upon the happy mood of Herbert, like the wind upon a well-tuned harp, awakening its strings to artless harmony. As he walked through the spacious streets, the large houses, with their marble steps and bright windows, looked to him to enclose happiness and elegance and intelligence. When, in passing an open door, his eye wandered for a moment up a long hall, he felt curious to enter—the inmates, he thought, must be charming people. Did the sound of a piano reach his ear—it bore on its melody a form of loveliness. Alfred Grey was rejoiced to see him. He was several years older than Herbert, and was on terms of intimacy with Mr. Barclay. Herbert had known him as the most frequent visitor at his uncle's, and had early felt for him that confiding regard which the younger members of a family are prone to entertain towards the friends of the elder. The frank and sprightly manner of Alfred was calculated to encourage this feeling, and the interest he always manifested in Herbert, had ripened it into a personal attachment, so that Herbert now that he was grown up, was strongly attracted towards him. When the hour for dining drew near, Alfred interrupted their conversation, telling Herbert that his sister expected them to dine with her. “You have seen my sister, Mrs. Vernon, at your uncle's. I have told her you were coming to pass the day with me, and that I would give her a share of your visit.— Ellen is fond of company, so that we shall probably have two or three others at dinner. The better for you, as you are now to begin the study of what is called the world. You will find men harder that Latin or Greek.— Their radical motives are often much more unlike their outward demonstrations than a Greek root is unlike its derivatives. And women—but let us go, or we shall get into another long talk.” They found at Mrs. Vernon's, Mr. Seldon, and another gentleman whom Herbert had seen before, Mr. Penniman; and a short time after themselves, Dr. Walsall and his daughter came in. Notwithstanding the contrary conclusion to which the spectacle of a dinner at the public table of one of our large American hotels would lead, it may be stated as a fact in the natural history of man, that eating is a sociable occupation. Whether it is to be accounted for by the action of the selfish principle, that the feeling of prosperity in himself diffuses over a man a superficial benevolence towards others,—according to which a diner would grow in graciousness with each mouthful; or that the sympathy of a common object renders a circle, engaged simultaneously in the satisfying of the first of earthly wants, peculiarly susceptible of mutual good will; or that the moistening of the palate like the oiling of a hinge, imparts a smoothness to the motions of the tongue; or that these several causes combine,—which is the most likely; certain it is, that good humor, if it be in the nature of the individuals at all, prevails round a dinner table. Each one is disposed to expand towards his neighbors accommodatingly in speech and feeling. Herein, human beings,—with the one exception of the spectacle above alluded to,—differ from other carnivorous animals, which in their hurried craunching and intent looks, have an aspect of concentrated selfishness. The elements of social enjoyment were on this occasion present in the fittest quantity and in excellent proportions. The company was small, so that at the table its unity was not broken; each individual contributing according to his will and means to the general entertainment. What each one had to say, went to the common fund of conversation, and was not diverted into separate channels, as it is apt to be when a meeting of the kind is numerous. The hostess was well suited to call into play the social and conversational resources of her guests, so as to produce lively harmony. Fond of society, she appeared in it with the animation of unaffected pleasure, so becoming in itself and so flattering to others. Graceful and affable, she possessed that nice tact which the desire and the ability to please confer. Mr. Vernon showed also to advantage. The most of his time was spent in the routine of mercantile business; but he had taste to view a scene like this as something more than mere relaxation from labor. He was one of those men whose surface is very susceptible of polish, and had his opportunities been better his merits would have been more substantial; still, his natural endowments were not of a calibre to induce the opinion that much had been lost for want of cultivation. Dr. Walsall was a talker; and like all others of the class, disposed to that conversational monopolizing which is only bearable when made by talent and wit. He was here kept in check by the superior intelligence of Alfred Grey, and somewhat, perhaps, by the fear of a more direct rebuke, which Alfred, at all times impatient of encroachment of any kind, would not have been slow to give.— Herbert was the least active participant in the scene: the most animated contributor to its 3 gaiety did not, however, derive from it more pleasure than he did. He felt at his ease: the absence of this feeling is the only drawback to the enjoyment of a young person beginning to associate with men and women. Few young men were more than Herbert under the influence of youthful diffidence, which, like the chill of the first plunge into a bath, betokens a healthful warmth below the surface. But there was in him no want of the self-confidence, which is the result of proper self-respect; and his mind was by nature too well balanced and his character too frank for the exhibition, under any circumstances, of an awkward bashfulness. His feelings at once shared the familiar sociability of the circle.— As the one who was most the stranger, and as the friend of her brother, Mrs. Vernon was led both by courtesy and duty to make him the particular object of hospitable attention. This she did, not by distinguishing him from the rest of the company by a direct attentiveness, but by a bearing as winning as it was natural, which blended her habitual affability with an unobtrusive personal interest in Herbert; so that he felt as much at his ease beside her as if he had been seated there for the hundredth time. On the other side of him sat Miss Walsall. He had never seen her before.— Her manner towards Herbert was as unconstrained as towards an old acquaintance, so that he several times looked into her face inquiringly, thinking that he must have been mistaken in believing her a stranger to him: there was a quiet self-possession in it. Hers was a countenance that invited observation by the placid calmness with which it bore it.— The eye returned to it the more frequently and dwelt upon it the longer from its superficial insensibility to the gaze. It did not court admiration: it was a passive recipient of it. It did not reflect the looks that fell upon it: it absorbed them. In such a countenance, there is a peculiar attractiveness, owing, perhaps, partly to the scope it gives to the imagination—its tranquil surface tempting each beholder to figure on it something of what he fancies or wishes it to express; partly, perhaps, to the character of submissiveness it seems to bespeak—always to a man's eye an engaging sign in woman. The conversation was lively; at first, as is wont, skimming over the surface of ordinary topics, and becoming deeper as the company became disengaged from the business of eating. Although Dr. Walsall was withheld from indulging his propensity at the expense of the others; being, like all great talkers similarly situated, uncomfortable under the restriction, he every now and then made an effort to break through it. Herbert was the pivot of one of these attempts. The Doctor had been thrown out for some time. Mr. Seldon had just been giving a description of an English nobleman's household, having been led to do so by allusions in a recent novel, which Alfred, called upon by the ladies, had criticised somewhat at length. When Mr. Seldon ceased speaking, the Doctor, who had got very impatient under his long silence, and who felt piqued that these two gentlemen should have held possession of the company's ear longer than they were disposed to let him hold it, took advantage of the pause, and abruptly asked Herbert what profession he had chosen. Herbert was taken by surprise by the question, not only from the sudden interruption of the current given to his thoughts by the previous conversation, but because the subject was one he had not as yet steadily considered. He answered, that he had made no choice. Alfred remarked, that he thought Mr. Barclay had done well in not hurrying his decision on such a point. The Doctor, delighted at having succeeded in introducing a topic on which he felt confident he could take the lead, was pleased to hear this from Alfred. “Hurrying his decision!” said he. “Why, Mr. Grey, when I was at Mr. Barclay's age, I had taken my degree in medicine and commenced the practice.” 3* “In your day, Doctor,” said Alfred, “there was something to be gained by hurry. The number of professional men was so small, that young graduates found practice waiting for them: now, they have to wait for practice.” “The greater reason for commencing early,” said the Doctor. “The longer they have to wait, the sooner they should begin.” “But a hasty choice may mar a man's fortune by a misdirection of his powers,” rejoined Alfred. “Moreover, the trials of competition are now so much greater, that when the choice is made—” “What,” interrupted the Doctor, “can fit a man for competition so well as practice? The sooner he begins, therefore, the sooner and the more effectually will he be formidable to competitors. As to misdirection of powers; there can be no misdirection, when a young man has industry and ambition. The mind, as Mr. Locke says, is like a sheet of white paper, upon which any thing may be written, and the way to make the most of its universal capacity is, to confine it to one subject.— Division of labor is as productive in the intellectual as in the mechanical world. A young man who wishes for eminence should concentrate his mind upon his profession, and the younger he is (his preparatory education being completed) the more easy will this concentration be. If he postpones determining upon his career, he will become interested in other pursuits, and when he sets about professional studies, he will find, that his mind, distracted by miscellaneous smatterings, is unfitted for the exclusive devotion which is essential to success, or will be trained to it with difficulty.” Here the Doctor, well satisfied with his progress, and not doubting that all who heard him were equally so, diverged into a panegyric on his own profession. This was a favorite topic with him; partly from sincerity, of which egotism was the father, and partly from the affectation which is the growth of worldliness. He was interrupted by Alfred: “Doctor, there is a question to be disposed of, before we reach the one you are entering upon—even admitting that the comparative merits of different professions and honest callings can be properly a subject for abstract discussion.” “What is that?” said the Doctor. “Whether,” answered Alfred, “the engaging in a profession or other established lucrative occupation be in all cases advisable. You seem to take that for granted.” “And do not you?” exclaimed the Doctor. “I look upon that as an established American idea. Mr. Seldon, who avows his English prepossessions, is the only one of this company, I presume, who does not adopt it.” “I do not differ from you entirely, Dr. Walsall,” said Mr. Seldon. “I regard the law as a branch of a liberal education: the study of it is essential to a gentleman.” “For one, Doctor, I do not agree with you,” said Mr. Penniman. “The prevalence of the notion, which you call an American idea, that every young man, whatever may be his circumstances, should engage in some business, is no favorable sign of the taste of a community, and is an evidence that the refinements and elegancies of life are not appreciated. The labors and habits of business are incompatible with that pervading polish, which only can make society agreeable. A few individuals may always be picked out”— here he bowed to the company—“who are exceptions to this effect; but their presence renders the general deficiency in manners the more conspicuous.” “Mr. Penniman,” said Dr. Walsall, “this exclusiveness is not only unrepublican—it is impracticable. You would undermine the basis of society in attempting to polish its surface.” “Not at all,” said Mr. Penniman. “In a wealthy city, the number of persons who have the means to live in elegance is large.— This class should be contented with their wealth, and not labor to increase it. Manners are artificial: they are like green-house plants—they require constant care. How can men who pass the most of every day in the drudgery and routine of business, acquire gracefulness either of body or mind? The business of the affluent should be the elegances of life. Duty as well as taste commends this to them. The refining of the manners elevates the morals of a community.” Mr. Penniman's father had been a tanner, and having made a large fortune, died, leaving his only son, just of age, his heir. The young Mr. Penniman immediately sold the tannery and bought a curricle. He soon after “made the tour of Europe,” and returned with a coat of arms and a French valet. He was now about eight and twenty, and a by no means insignificant member of “good society.” “The neglect, or more properly, the perversion of natural advantages,” said Alfred, “is strikingly exemplified in the conduct of those classes of this country who are the most favored by circumstances. It would seem as if, under the invisible influence of supreme justice,—ever active to equalize the lots of humanity,—we restrict ourselves socially in proportion to our exemption from political trammels. Unburdened from the state by the weight of laws, we counterbalance our freedom as citizens by the voluntary subjection of ourselves, as men, to a social despotism of opinion, to which is applied the name of public—with as much reason as that of world is to a coterie of gossips.” Mr. Penniman had a horror of satire, and began to feel uncomfortable. Dr. Walsall was not less dissatisfied: he perceived that he should have to be silent for some time. Alfred had not taken up the conversation for the purpose of refuting the opinions of either of these gentlemen: that, by itself, he thought an unprofitable task, and he never talked for display. Truth was always his object when in earnest, and he became so now on Herbert's account. Observing that Herbert listened attentively, he proceeded.—“The mighty circumstances which cast us a strong young people upon these fresh shores, disenthralled us from the tyranny of European custom as well as from that of government. Boldly and wisely have we used our liberty in the construction of our political system; but in much else we have been blind to its value or we have abused it. Original in our principles of government, we are in our manners and many of our habits servile imitators. The result is, the littleness inseparable from any imitation of the kind, and the awkwardness which is the effect of its unfitness, superadded to the native vulgarity of the foreign original. We set up the idol fashion, and we worship it in the spirit of exclusiveness;—a false idol, even where it is rendered imposing by the prestiges of custom and the pomp of aristocratic circumstance,—a mean spirit even where the worship is sanctioned by national institutions and hereditary usage. Here, where the idol stands—not on the high pedestal of time-honored privilege, crowned with precious stones and shining in rich robes,—but on the shallow basis of ephemeral pretension, unadorned, in naked deformity,—the worship is self-degradation.” “Come, Alfred,” interrupted Mrs. Vernon, “you view the subject too seriously.— The monster fashion is a very harmless monster; fantastic, if you please, but nothing more. The worst of fashion is its folly.” “You give it respectability by making it of so much importance. Ridicule is weapon enough for it,” said Mr. Seldon. “You are too severe,” said Mr. Penniman.” “Entirely so,” said the Doctor. “Were the social defect,” resumed Alfred, “to which I allude, on the surface,—a mere partial disfigurement of bad taste,—a blister, without depth; the fine point of ridicule were enough. Or, were it nothing more than the impertinence of a few pretenders, aiming at the hollow distinctions of ostentation; contempt alone would be its due: it would not move indignation. These are but symptoms: 4 the disease is deep-seated. In every community, (this for example,) in that portion of it which should be the freest, there is a slavery of the mind—a double slavery; to the object which is little, and to the means to attain it which are debasing. The object is, the outward shows, the public sensualism, if I may so speak, of life: the means are, the soul-absorbing, soul-contracting gathering of wealth. The mind is sold, that the body may be gaudily decked. What is called fashionable life is wholly corporeal. For what is the intercourse of the self-important actors in it more than the mechanical movements and automaton mutterings of puppets—etiquette being the wire that guides them? What are their equipages and halls but so much superfiuous raiment? Means and leisure which might be profile, are barrenly dedicated to empty nothings. The substantial goods of existence,—the gladdening, the heart-purifying,—are cast away: and not even is the outward form of beauty acquired; for polish and grace no more follow wealth, than does the possession of a library imbue its possessor with literature. Manners should flow from within: their only pure source is in the heart— in high and proper feeling. The manners of outward putting on—the factitious accompaniment of conventional observance, are to the ease and frank bearing which unconsciously attend a cultivated mind, what the changeless color of a painted cheek is to the tint of na ture varying with the heart's impulses. “This coarse poison which thus blotches the face, as it were, of the social body, pervades other of its limbs. The small circle, drawn in the spirit of exclusiveness by vulgar vanity, casts a glare over a wide circumference. To a crowd without its jealous limits, it is radiant with attraction; to those particularly, upon whom fortune has sprinkled her golden dust, the object of envy and admiration and hope. Seeing that gold is its basis, as well as the stuff of which its ornaments are made, they task both mind and body to produce that which is the smoothest key to open its barriers, and the surest source of brilliancy when within them. What a waste of energy! What a prostitution of mind! What a shallow result! What an unprofitable existence!” “This is very well as satire, Alfred,” said Mr. Vernon. “But it is as applicable to a European as to an American city. It has no peculiar fitness to ourselves.” “It has a peculiar fitness to ourselves,” answered Alfred. “We are a republic: Europe is aristocratic. The forms and modes of social intercourse and occupation there, have grown out of political institutions: they are the leaves that are fed and take their shape and hue from old deep roots. We are free, alike from the necessity imposed by laws, and from the habit of centuries. The class here which has leisure, is called by circumstances and ambition as well as by duty and taste, to self-improvement. It does not heed or it does not understand the call. It has no zeal to rise, but grovels in the dirt—its desires ending in avarice, its aspirations in ostentation.” After a few remarks from Mr. Penniman and Dr. Walsall, neither of whom, however, attempted to continue the subject in this strain, the conversation became political.— Mrs. Vernon made a movement to rise, saying, that Miss Walsall and herself would leave the gentlemen to politics. Mr. Penniman protested against such a double infliction: this separation, he said, was a Vandal custom, and politics were under any circumstances the bane of good company. Some one proposed that it be put to the vote whether the gentlemen should leave the table with the ladies. “Voting is so vulgar,” said Mr. Penniman. “That's a good thought,” said Mr. Vernon, not noticing the comment of Mr. Penniman. Alfred, Mr. Penniman, and Herbert, were for accompanying them: Mr. Seldon and the Doctor against it. 4* “Three to two, gentlemen,” said Mr. Vernon, rising; and the whole party went into the drawing room. There the conversation reassumed a lighter character. After some time, Dr. Walsall asked if any of the gentlemen were going to Mrs. Gore's; it was time to think of it if they were. “Mr. Barclay, you are, I am sure, and you, Mr. Seldon, are you not?” “No; I believe not,” said Mr. Seldon.— “But I recommend to Mr. Barclay to go. It will amuse him, and a young man should go through a course of balls.” “Yes,” said Alfred; “as he does through a course of metaphysics. They are both parts of a liberal education, and one is as profitable as the other.” “Fie, Alfred,” cried Mr. Vernon, “you are as bad as a merchant,—always calculating profit and loss.” “Besides,” said Mrs. Vernon, “there is profit as well as amusement in such a scene to a young man. You think so much is to be learnt, Alfred, from mixing freely with all classes of men; you will admit that the study of women is not without instruction.” “The study of women! A young man studying women!” said Alfred. “Herbert, can you with your naked eye see the spots on the sun at mid-day? You can do that as easily as you can see what a woman really is.” “No man, Alfred,” said Mrs. Vernon, “young or old, can fix his eyes on the sun at mid-day, so that your illustration is not good; for you surely wont assert, that no man can understand a woman.” “He can look undazzled at the sun rising or setting; so I advise you, Herbert, to stay here and study Mrs. Vernon and her daughter,” said Alfred. Mrs. Vernon, one of whose children was by her side, was still beautiful at thirty-five. To attract the attention of the company towards her in this way, was an indirect compliment: had it not been so, Alfred would not have done it. “You shall not escape,” returned Mrs. Vernon. “You ca'nt support your illustration.” “Yes, I can,” said Alfred. “I did not say a man cannot gaze at the sun at mid-day; but that he can not do it with his naked eye.— He can do it through a smoked glass.” “A smoked glass!” “Yes. The smoked glass of a man before the dazzling being of woman, is his own darkened heart. Disappointment cleanses his brain of bewildering fancies. The mariner approaches the glittering form floating majestically across his path: it is an iceberg. Too late he discovers his peril, when wrecked on its treacherous roots spread invisible under him. Fortunate if he escapes with life,—ever after to fly when its glancing rays meet his sight.” “You carry such a glass, yourself, do you not Mr. Grey?” said Mr. Penniman. Mr. Penniman would have liked to have some deflecting substance before his own eyes to turn aside the look Alfred gave him. “Come Mr. Barclay,” said Dr. Walsall, let me have the honor of presenting you at Mrs. Gore's.” “Be my knight, Mr. Barclay,” added his daughter. Herbert gave his arm to Miss Walsall, who took her leave. “I got the better of you, Mr. Grey.” said the Doctor, as Herbert went out of the room, “notwithstanding your camera obscura of the heart and your similes.” “Ah! Doctor,” retorted Alfred, “you are accustomed to mistake the triumphs of nature for your own.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. A YOUNG sailor gliding down the current which bears him to the untried sea, was never more gay of heart than was Herbert, embarked now on the stream of amusement. Inasmuch as our simile adopts the common likening of human existence to the ocean, it is defective; for what is called a life of pleasure is too shallow to float a burden heavy enough to withstand a storm. We shall therefore change it, and compare such a life to an artificial lake, or rather, pond, fed from small, and not the purest sources; not deep enough to swell majestically in unison with the tempest, although the frivolous admire its ripples, and the weak may be drowned under them; pretty at a distance, but from its stagnant surface exhaling a treacherous miasma. Herbert walked in the streets in the morning; was almost daily a guest at dinner companies; and passed most of his evenings at balls, or other less numerous assemblages, called conversational or musical. The manner in which he spent his time caused no dissatisfaction to his uncle. Mr. Barclay had studied and practised life thoroughly. Every day of his own—and he was past fifty—had been a day of instruction. At his outset, he had had many external difficulties to contend against, and his feelings had added others. He married early: this made his struggle in the world the more arduous, and his disappointments the more oppressive. His friends said it was an imprudent act:—not once, in his hardest moments, when poverty seemed to dog him like an enemy, smiting his toilsome endeavors with barrenness, did he himself regret it. He now would say:—that marriage in young people is seldom of itself imprudent,—the pairing of couples is often unfortunate,— but that there is for every human being a mate that would make him better and happier, could each find out the one designed by nature for himself, and that the better a man is, the larger is the number that would suit him; that elderly people who never have been married, are the only ones who should not marry. Worldly parents who looked upon marriage as something to be weighed and measured like an article of commerce, expectant old bachelors and maids; and some others, wondered how a man of Mr. Barclay's sense could entertain so absurd a theory on this subject. He applied it to both sexes. Few men can properly be called men of much experience; for experience implies great variety and great quantity of trials.— The trials of most men are limited in both respects; not from absence of opportunity, but from want of capability. Many are too timid, many too indolent, many too selfish, to involve themselves in a diversified activity: some have not the strength of feeling to engage deeply in life, and some, not intellect enough to support them if they desire to do so: thus some suffer much and learn little; while others, from coldness of nature, suffer little, but deceive themselves with the conceit that they learn much. How few are those who explore the physical varieties of the earth's surface. It is the same with the world of mind—the world of feeling and of thought. It, too, surrounds every one; but how partial is the knowledge that each obtains of it. The hopes, the fears, the pleasures, the daily ongoings and peculiar existence of the great mass of their neighbors, are as little known or cared for by most men, as are the vegetable and mineral peculiarities of an adjacent territory. Many are the inhabitants of the plain who have never been awed by the thunder of the cataract; not less is the number of those who have never thrilled with fellow-feeling for a passion-rent heart: the grand spectacle of mountain piled on mountain stretching up miles through the 5 clouds, is not less often enjoyed through the external sight, than is the deep inward sense of uncalculating benevolence, exalting him, who feels it, far above the little egoism of common life: the misery of social destitution is unknown to as many, as the intense fearfulness of the wrecking storm. Hence, the minds of few men expand with age. They grow skilful in performing the routine of life, as the journeyman mechanic does at his trade; but, few attain by experience even to knowledge parallel to that of the master mechanic, and, still fewer, to the deep insight into principles, and the comprehensive view of proportions, which distinguish and delight and elevate the artist. Mr. Barclay was one of the latter. In early life, his young impulses had been given a scope that would peril the moral being of most men: indulgence had strengthened, not weakened his. As contention brings out truth where there is power to perceive it, the contest of his higher against the solicitations of his animal feelings developed more decidedly his innate excellence. He, at first, when his life had taken a more steady course, looked back with shuddering at the escapes he seemed to have made; but he afterwards obtained a clearer view of himself, and became satisfied that he had never been in danger of ruin. He even went so far as to believe, that had not accidental connexions led to the circumstances and engagements and acts which now formed the frame work, as it were, of his life, innate desires and dispositions would have produced others similar to them in character; thus ascribing not only the direction of his career, but even much of what is called accidental, to his internal nature instead of to external associations.— This was a particular conclusion in regard to himself. He did not state it as a general truth; he believed it, however, to be much more frequently and strongly applicable than it is commonly thought. He had often shared with riotous companions in scenes of levity and looseness: the flooding tide of young passion had swept him into the dark caves where vice creeps that it may not see its own shadow. But he emerged again: satiety brought a deeper pain than transient disgust; and the vigorous growth of his moral and intellectual nature, cast out the taint that poisons the core of many. He had stood on the precipice to which indulgence leads, and had looked into the abysses that yawn around it: the sights he had seen and the pangs he had felt, revealed to him fearful but pregnant secrets. He had fathomed the depths of animalism without being engulphed by it, and had thus the experience without the forfeits of its victims. Those who escape—whether they avoid or resist, or, yielding, pass unwithered and unweakened through the temptations to licentious enjoyment in youth, are awaited for when they engage more actively and responsibly in life, by other dangers, less obvious, and less dreaded because undiscerned, but not less real, than those which threatened their well-being from the untempered gratification of animal desires;—the dangers of selfishness. The half knowledge which deliberately distrusts, is as fatal as the self-abandonment of passion. The prudence which seeks safety by narrowing the outward avenues of the heart, is as destructive of happiness, as the dissipation which wastes the fresh treasures of feeling. These dangers Mr. Barclay escaped as securely as he did the first. Through failure and success he passed uncorrupted Disappointment did not sour him: the treachery of a few did not pervert his judgment: from adversity he learnt charity as well as prudence: prosperity brought him no triumphs. Collision with his fellows polished without hardening him. His sympathy with human nature enlarged with his knowledge of it.— His trials not only purified his own heart; they taught him tolerance of the errings of others. He did not learn the existence and 5* nature of virtue merely from his consciousness, or from the happy few who daily practise it: he discerned its germs even through the rank growth of iniquity. To the knowledge he imbibed from active intercourse with men, he added that which is acquired from a secondary source—from books, those imperishable mirrors which reflect the being of man in all its conditions. He had received the usual quantity and kind of expensive instruction, and at the age of eighteen had taken a degree at one of the most frequented colleges. He soon discovered that he had learnt very little at the latter, although he graduated with honor. He was immediately put to study law, and at twenty-one was admitted to practice. His father designed, now, that he should travel for two years in Europe. In this design, however, his own wishes and plans did not concur.— He married,—suddenly, it appeared to his family and friends, who learnt his attachment and engagement only a few days before the marriage took place. The lady who became his wife he had met for the first time about six months before in the hovel of a poor family. The impression of her character, which the circumstances of this meeting were calculated to make on a mind like his, was deepened by the force of beauty. They soon knew and loved each other. She was an only child, and, by the recent death of her mother, an orphan, with a small income, the greater part of which she paid for living in the house of a coarse uncle. Her first meeting with Mr. Barclay was the dawn of a new existence to her,—not of the transient illumination merely, which suddenly brightens the opening path of manhood and womanhood, when the strongest passion of nature reveals itself, quickening the whole being, and sometimes leaving the soul the darker for its devouring energy;— but, of the lasting brightness which flows from the union of kindred hearts, and flows as long as the union lasts. The vulgarity and roughness of her uncle were repugnant to her. Family afflictions during the life of her parents, had humbled her mind. Intercourse with Mr. Barclay moved its deep sources: her clear genial nature expanded like a drooping rich flower, long deprived of the sunshine and moisture designed to evolve its beauty. For several years Mr. Barclay struggled with adverse circumstances. Soon after his marriage, his father suffered by a law suit a heavy loss of fortune, by which his allowance was reduced to a trifling sum. He was faithful in the execution of whatever business was entrusted to him, and his talents were acknowledged; but the initiatory drudgery of a profession was hateful to him, and he gave much of his time to engagements which, although they demonstrated his value as a citizen, repelled rather than attracted clients; he was, too, more liberal in gifts of private charity and public spirit than suited his limited means. He had reached his twenty-eighth year, when his father died.— The property he became possessed of by this event, added to his wife's small income and his earnings, was a competency, and, with their moderate habits and wishes, it was more. Of his new means, and the liberty he acquired with them, he made a use that to most persons seemed eccentric, and to many imprudent. He travelled for several years. Since he had become a man, he had been, in the enlarged sense of the word, a student; investigating science and literature to satisfy the craving of his mind. He sought in books to learn the nature of man and of the physical elements that surround him. He read—not to be informed of the opinions of men; but to obtain knowledge of their feelings and capacities, and the practical results of these: he interrogated nature to admire her beauties and learn her resources. A natural part of the course of study into which his mental wants thus led him, was travel. He traveled to observe the modification of humanity in its divisions into nations, and, like Pythagoras, to converse with the wisest of the most advanced communities. After devoting some time to visiting portions of his own country that he had not yet seen, he spent four years in Europe, sojourning in capitals and traversing those parts that are most interesting from the character and doings of the inhabitants, of the picturesqueness of the scenery. With cheerfulness on his return home, he resumed, after so long an interruption, the practice of his profession. Instead of repining at the necessity of recommencing labor, he set himself down to it contentedly, grateful that circumstances had permitted him to give such a scope to his curiosity. That had been satisfied. His mind had been fully and richly fed. Most profitably as well as delightfully he had spent nearly the whole of his patrimony, and he now gave his time to supplying the want of it with more zeal than he had labored in the beginning of his career, and with a prospect of success which his enlarged and matured powers, supported by industry, rendered certain. He had just begun to realize this prospect, when, a relation of his wife dying, left her, unexpectedly, a sum which much more than replaced the diminution of his own fortune. Upon this, he abandoned his profession, and bought in the neighborbood of the city a small tract of woodland where he created the residence already described. To a young man of worth, it was a privilege and a happiness, to be the inmate of Mr Barclay's house. Herbert valued his situation, although it was only later, in retrospection, that he fully appreciated its advantages. Mr. Barclay had a bright confidence in life,— a happy, joint, result of temperament and reflection; he thought well of his nephew's capacity and disposition; he had himself run the round of superficial amusement which now engrossed his nephew's time; Herbert was under his daily observation and influence: the result of all which was, that he even took pleasure in observing this temporary dissipation, his sympathy in whatever Herbert enjoyed not being disturbed by any apprehensions of consequences. The thought that he might misplace his affections and marry unsuitably, crossed Mr. Barclay's mind; but this was a thought that could not but suggest itself to any one interested in any young person in any circumstances; and he was too wise to permit himself to be disquieted by general fears. Mr. Barclay's warm concern and liberality won the affection of Herbert as entirely as his general kindness and fine intelligence commanded his respect. It was a pleasure to the nephew to be communicative with his uncle respecting himself—his feelings and conduct, as well as his opinions; and so lenient did he find him, that instead of apprehending blame, Herbert had recourse to him for palliation in times of self-reproach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. A community that has reached a state which implies an extensive cultivation of the resources of human nature, presents much variety in the characters of the individuals and classes of individuals produced in its bosom. The further the advance from barbarism, the greater will be this variety. Savage life is same. Its surface has little diversity, because its depths are not stirred.— Only a few primitive springs of action are braced in it, and the motion which these impart, although vigorous, and differing in degrees of vigor, is, in each individual, in the same direction. A tribe of savages differs as much and in the same manner from a civilized community, as a prairie with its growth of 6 uniform wild grass does from a domain of variegated culture, where the fertile resources of the soil, developed by tillage, present that rich result which capacious nature always yields to cunning art. As the numerous and various faculties,— barely awakened in the savage state,—emerge into activity, they create a field for their own operation. The interests and sympathies, the occupations and pleasures, that multiply with civilization, while they are the effect of the enlargement of man's mental capacity, at the same time afford him, in proportion to their multiplicity, scope for the employment of his intellect and the gratification of his feelings. The numerousness of the sources whence the craving faculties are solicited, and the infinite combinations which the number of the latter and the degrees of their power admit of, necessarily cause great variety in the objects of action, in the modifications of opinion, in the manifestations of feeling, and, consequently, great diversity in character.— The stronger and more pervading the impulse at the common centre of all human doings, the mind,—the more numerous and the longer will be the radii of thought and deed that proceed from it; and, like the beams from the sun, the further these stretch, the wider will be the distance between them, however, design, for specific ends, may combine their agency. In a thriving community like one of our towns, this effect is conspicuous. A large American city embraces the great results of the advanced civilization of the age,—the arts which minister to comfort and elegance,—the institutions which, in addition to the provisions of government, philanthropy and intellectual enterprise establish for the protection and progress of society. The tendency to uniformity produced by the spirit of accumulation, naturally so active in a new country, is more than countervailed by the healthful vigor imparted by multiform exertion; and the expansion of individual dispositions encouraged by unprecedented freedom of thought and action. Although by the constitution of human nature, moral improvement follows the enlargement and diffusion of knowledge, its progress is slow. The waters of life, even when most tranquil, cast up constant impurities; and in the strong stirrings of them, ultimately productive of good, so much of the impulse is given by the self-seeking feelings, that often, the deeper their motion the thicker and more turbid are they, and thence the more capable of bearing the gross burdens of selfishness that are launched upon them. These float here the more successfully, because in the wide field for material effort temptingly displayed in a new territory to a young people, armed with all the immaterial power of the oldest, there is more scope for coincidence between private selfishness and public benefit. He, who is capable, industrious, energetic, will obtain credit and consequence, although his character be faithfully described in these words of an old writer:—“All other passions he sacrifices to his ambition: he laughs at disappointments, is inured to refusals, and no repulse dismays him; this renders the whole man always flexible to his interest: he can defraud his body of necessaries, and allow no tranquility to his mind, and counterfeit, if it will serve his turn, temperance, chastity, compassion, and piety itself, without one grain of virtue or religion: his endeavors to advance his fortune per fas et nefas are always restless, and have no bounds, but when he is obliged to act openly, and has reason to fear the censure of the world.”—The boldness of conceit and the confidence of tried sagacity urge him into notoriety, where skill in dissimulation enables him so to profit by the general esteem of practical industry, as to appear the very personification of public spirit, while his thoughts are unceasingly, without momentary divergence, concentrated upon one single object,—so to plan and direct his acts, that all of them, the smallest and the 6* largest, shall contribute to his personal advancement. Every movement he makes in life is designed to tend to this result. A step which is discovered to lead from it, is quickly retraced. He will abjure opinions,—sacrifice friends,—pervert truth,—fabricate falsehood,— say any say, do any deed, which may be so said or done as not to come with a shadow between him and the sole source whence he derives animating light,—public opinion. By respecting the forms of morality; by captivating individual favor through flattery; by timing as well the ostentation of humility as of triumph; by watchfully studying appearances; by letting no occasion escape for making what is wait upon what seems;—it is inconceivable, by an upright mind, ignorant as well as innocent of the arts of worldly rising, what consideration may be obtained, and sometimes for a long while retained, by a man morally worthless. Such a man was Hugh Langley. When Herbert, after the dinner of Mrs. Vernon's, entered Mrs. Gore's rooms with Miss Walsall on his arm, Langley was among the few guests already assembled. As quickly as his sight was his mind fixed upon them. He did not know Herbert. He moved nearer to Mrs. Gore to hear his name. He then addressed Miss Walsall with a manner of mingled respectfulness and familiarity, and with a smile which invariably attended his approach to any one, as the wag of his tail does that of a spaniel. This smile habit had rendered involuntary, and it was in so far natural. The first moment the attention of Herbert was directed from them, he whispered to Miss Walsall—“Introduce me to Mr. Barclay;” which she did, and then, withdrawing her arm from Herbert's, asked him to come to her presently, as she wished to introduce him to some ladies. Langley immediately with a very cordial manner, engaged in conversation with Herbert; spoke of his uncle in warm terms of esteem; of his studies and amusements at the university, responding to his remarks with anecdotes of his own college life, invited Herbert to visit him unceremoniously at his office, saying that he should give himself the pleasure of calling on him at his uncle's in a day or two; and concluded by presenting him to several gentlemen near them; so that Herbert when he rejoined Miss Walsall, thanked her for so sociable and intelligent an acquaintance. Herbert was the object of general attention. He inherited from his parents a standing at once respectable and fashionable, which his own qualities were well calculated to support; and the high esteem universally entertained for his uncle, strengthened the favorable disposition towards him. Mrs. Gore's party was the occasion of his introduction to the fashionable society of the town. Mothers and aunts, especially, took a lively interest in him; and it is no imputation upon their daughters and nieces, that his fine face was by many of them transported to an important position in their aerial castles. He became at once a favorite with the old and young of both sexes. A party was incomplete without him, and some were given in compliment to himself. He was intoxicated,—by the liveliness of the scenes,—by the beauty of women,—by the smiles that played around him,—by the brilliancy, in a word, of the spectacle; for life is at first but a spectacle, when entered through the halls of fashionable pleasure. Gay appearances only, present themselves: reality is but superficially or partially perceptible. Whatever is harsh, or mean, or painful, or discordant, or inelegant, is kept out of view: the experienced know of their existence: to Herbert they were not only invisible, but unknown. The young savage who issues from his woods to the sea, and lying down on its sunny shore, enjoys the delicious exhilaration of its waters breaking gently over him, dreams not that the wave which laves his body, may have swept over a wreck, or fed a monster, or echoed the thunder of human conflict. The conduct of Langley at Mrs. Gore's requires explanation. In the scheme of worldly elevation, the prosecution of which was his daily labor, he reflected, that a wife might be an efficient coadjutor. In this he judged rightly. He who gains renown through the efforts of pure intellect,—the man of science or literature,—derives no aid to his public career from women; for he goes not personally into the arena,— he sends his works to contend with rival works. But the practical politician, who seeks distinction, brings about his results by contact,—by collision with men. He must move in concert with, and in opposition to other men. He must be constantly personally visible and active. Hence, his wife can co-operate with him. If she shares his ambition and ability, she can give him direct assistance and counsel. Her personal qualities have scope for influence. His individual basis is, too, extended by the addition of her family to his own. Independently of these advantages, contingent upon the character and connections of the woman he marries, marriage itself obtains for a man a certain kind of consideration. It adds to his stability in the public eye. He is looked upon as having thereby more closely bound himself to the community; as having taken a deeper root; and, consequently, as being a safer dependence for public confidence. These considerations were embraced by Langley's calculating mind. He was approaching thirty: he had a standing in his profession, at the bar, which already secured to him a good income, and his reputation was growing. He was now, therefore, himself well equipped, on his own principle, for matrimonial enterprise. He had, accordingly, a short time before, determined to marry; and in such a way, if possible, as to unite all the public advantages of the step. After a deliberate survey of the circle from which a choice was to be made, his judgment rested on Miss Walsall. She was the only daughter of a man of wealth and influence: her family connection was extensive and substantial: she was reputed intelligent, and was personally attractive; and Langley, though not of the constitution to be strongly susceptible of emotions of beauty, and, therefore, never swayed by it, knew its public value: her father, he was confident, would favor his suit, for he was aware that the Doctor had a high opinion of his talents and prospects. A few days before Mrs. Gore's party he had taken his resolution; and, as with every thing he undertook, his mind was from that moment busied in planning the means to carry it into effect, and with an earnestness proportioned to the importance of its object. Already had he made demonstrations towards Miss Walsall, distantly and cautiously. He was prepared to continue them, and was watching for her arrival, when she entered with Herbert. In spite of his habitual self-possession, a scowl suddenly darkened for a moment his even brow. He was taken by surprise. Had he a rival?—perhaps more. The hearing of Herbert's name relieved him. He knew that he must be a new acquaintance of Miss Walsall. He might, however, become a rival, and a formidable one. His own part was instantly taken. He determined to become intimate with Herbert; to attach himself to him as closely as he could. He would thus have the means of observing his designs, and, should they tend to cross his own, of counteracting them, if this could be done. 7</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. About a fortnight after the dinner at Mrs. Vernon's, Alfred Grey went out to Mr. Barclay's. He had just left Herbert, who had gone into town early. After a few moments, addressing himself to Mr. Barclay, he said. “I have come out to have some conversation with you about your nephew: I don't like his associates.” “Why, is he not more with you and your sister than with any other persons?” said Mrs. Barclay. “No: he sees Miss Walsall every day, I believe; and Langley has taken a violent affection for him. I suspect them both: they are too smooth-faced and smooth-spoken to be honest.” “You know you have confessed being too suspicious, Alfred,” said Mrs. Barclay. “But we know, Elizabeth,” said Mr. Barclay, “that if we were to take Alfred's confessions for his own character, he himself would not be a safe associate for any one.” “Suspicion, however,” said Alfred, “is a good thing. Have you not found it so in your experience, Mr. Barclay? It is an antidote that counteracts many threatening ills in life.” “I should call it rather, a preventive,” answered Mr. Barclay; “and the wisest of the faculty, I believe, regard preventives as seldom serviceable to the body, urging uniform temperance as the best security even against specific dangers.” “Are you acquainted with Langley,” said Alfred.” “Only superficially.” “Do you know him?” said Mrs. Barclay to Alfred. “Personally, not further than Mr. Barclay does: but I know that he is cunning and a flatterer—a pretty good foundation to build a scoundrel upon.” “And Miss Walsall, Alfred,” said Mr. Barclay, “what do you know of her; her father is one of the wise men of the town.” “Do you mean that for satire on the Doctor or the town?—Of his daughter I know little: she is pretty and graceful, and has what is called good manners—that is, she is unembarrassed in company and dispenses smiles on all who approach her.” “Your sister is intimate with her and likes her, does she not?” inquired Mrs. Barclay.” “Oh!—Ellen is intimate with and likes every body. I tell her, she is the loosest person in her acquaintances I know.” “I wish to get some knowledge of the character of Miss Walsall,” said Mr. Barclay. “Herbert, who is not disposed to conceal any thing from us, has spoken frequently of her as of others, and, I think, with a good deal of admiration. Of course, from him we can learn little, for he has seen only the surface of her mind, which seems to be as smooth as her face.” “And he is not likely,” said Alfred, “to see much farther, after a longer acquaintance. The city intercourse of young people brings only their surfaces in contact. They never meet without preparation: their minds as well as persons are glossed: they go through a prescribed routine, in which the individual characteristics of each can be but partially displayed: the intellect has some scope,—the feelings scarcely any; and a little art can make either appear other than they are, to more practised observers than Herbert.” “You come then to the conclusion,” said Mrs. Barclay, “that our well-being is the sport of fortune; all of happiness that depends on marriage being abandoned to the blind impulses of the affections, misled by the shows of artifice.” “In this artificial state,” replied Alfred, “such is the case generally; but it is not necessarily 7* so. When a danger is known or apprehended, it may mostly be avoided. Of those who are thus exposed, few are aware of their danger; some, probably, could not be made sensible of it; to many, indeed, it does not exist, for their natures are so common that they risk little, and chance will provide for them as well as they can provide for themselves.” “Self-delusion, the source of so much failure, is, I believe, here more to be feared than any other delusion, or than all others together,” said Mr. Barclay. “When the inclination to it is strong, it is doubtless encouraged under the circumstances you describe; but, on the other hand, the weakening of it strengthens one against all other deceptions and temptations.” “Do you think,” asked Mrs. Barclay, “that Herbert is particularly liable to this?” “Yes: he is hopeful and prone to build up a future in his mind; and these dispositions, conjoined with warm feelings, produce a tendency to magnify the importance of present wishes and desires. The latter are incorporated with imaginings; they give a substance to day-dreams, while these beautify them with bright ideal colors. A mind of this constitution is peculiarly disposed to cherish what has taken hold of it—to give preference to a present probability over all possibilities of the same nature. All of us are subject to this kind of delusion, which is distinct from the egotistical exaggerations of self-esteem. Herbert, is, I think, somewhat more so than most persons. He has, however, very good elements of prudence.” “All the elements of the mind are confounded,” said Alfred, “by the tempest which, at his age, is apt, self-generated like the whirlwind, to rise up, enveloping alike the sources and objects of thought and feeling in mist,—” “Which leaves them the clearer and brighter for its temporary envelopment,” said Mr. Barclay. “Yes:—one sees some things the more distinctly afterwards, from the devastation that has swept off other and sometimes better things—which obstructed the view of them.” “Love is seldom this madness you make it,” said Mr. Barclay; “not even in morbid temperaments. Its first fervor is tyrannous enough, to be sure; compelling the strongest into subjection; but its effects in disappointment are for the most part laughable, rather than melancholy. Let a man risk boldly under its command—brave fire and water and the wrath of man,—commit imprudence and folly;—any extreme, not inconsistent with self-respect, is pardonable in a man for a woman, and may be laudable: but if he fail, it becomes him not to succomb. To gain a woman's love, he may break his neck; but my dear Alfred, he should not cut his throat if he misses it. The extravagances he shall commit in the pursuit, although they be not practicable, or even proper, in general, are admired by the world, and are indeed admirable, as being demonstrations of a noble feeling of manhood—devotion to women: they are the poetry of life, which awakens the enthusiasm of all, though few have occasion to realize it. But his misery under disappointment excites, and should excite, little sympathy. This is no demonstration of chivalrous devotion, but of moral weakness. And, be assured, that with few exceptions, the prolonging of unhappiness from this source, is the self-torturing of pride. Strong as my fellow-feeling for Herbert is, I shall laugh at his love-troubles. My concern is exclusively for the consequences of success; and here my apprehensions are not so strong as those of most persons perhaps would be: for although I believe that in marriage, there is much scope for choice, dependant on individual peculiarities and relative fitness,—unhappiness, I think, seldom flows directly from marriage. He who has the capacity for happiness will be happy in spite of circumstances,—these affect, but do not control it; and marriage is but a circumstance—or rather a train of circumstances—against which, as against others, he can if necessary defend himself; for “the mind in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.” Far am I from being indifferent whether Herbert be or be not put to this trial: I would rather that in his chances in life, his trials should come from any other source. I therefore wish that he may not marry blindly, but that in this, as in every other step in life, he should move with forethought. Should he not, fortune may still do for him what he shall not have done for himself; and if he make a bad choice, he may still be happy.” “And if he have the same wish,” said Alfred, “it will be difficult for him to act by it: he has a good share of impetuosity. How shall he be put in the way of choosing?” “By making him sensible,” answered Mr. Barclay, “that he has the power to choose. It is as much, ignorance of our ability to resist a particular inclination, as the force of the inclination itself, that makes our feelings sway us against reason and our interest. Young people believe that love,—not the passion itself, for that would be a truth, and one too deep for their minds to seize,—but an individual access of it directed upon a particular person, is irresistible, or resistible only painfully and with a wasting cost of misery.— This they learn,—partly, from novels, pretending to picture human nature, which they do with as much fidelity and completeness as the drawing of a single limb, distorted by muscular effort, pictures the proportions of the human body,—and partly, from the promptings of their own undisciplined or mis-developed feelings. Thus, when the passion first awakens in their bosoms, they have no thought that its wild throbbings are ever to cease. They surrender themselves to it as to a blessed eternity. They have been told to distrust it; they have read that it is as dangerous as it is delightful: but they have never been made to know that it can be mastered; they have never been even told that there may be a pleasure in opposing as well as in yielding to it. Experience alone, I am aware, can make them fully realize that this, like other feelings, can be opposed and mastered; but, while nothing can fully supply the place of personal trial, a knowledge of their capacity to do so with which it is possible to imbue them, may serve much to temper their impulses and influence their action.” “That this is possible,” said Alfred, “and that the result would be as you state, I do not doubt; but not suddenly. Had your nephew, naturally well endowed as he is, been educated by yourself, he would, I am sure, illustrate the truth of your opinion.” “I do not look for this,” said Mr. Barclay, “nor should I rely upon it, even if Herbert had undergone, from childhood to the present time, a much better course of mental discipline than he has, so incalculable are, in an individual case, the effects of combinations of feelings and of outward influences. My remark was general. On the other hand, instances of self-control are numerous, where moral culture has been as defective as in him,—most of them, it is true, the offspring of necessity, but not on that account the less indicative of the happy flexibility of the human mind.” “The point at present of most moment,” said Mrs. Barclay, “is, not to determine whether Herbert can or cannot act with discretion in marrying; but to discover whether Miss Walsall is worthy to be his wife. For, what is the use of his being able to control his inclinations unless he can ascertain whether in a particular case it will be wise to control them; and, surely, if we cannot find out what Miss Walsall's real character is, it is not to be expected that he can, even if he should not be a lover.” “Elizabeth's remark, Alfred, reminds us,” said Mr. Barclay, “of the difference between speculation and practice, and carries us back to the point whence we started—viz: your suspicions.” 8 “Which suspicions,” replied Alfred, “have no particular foundation. Only, there is a worldly character about the family. The father is ostentatious and formal and empty-headed: his son, you know, deserted a pretty young girl to marry a plain rich widow: the daughter looks and speaks like both father and brother, and I hope is honester and warmer than either; but until I have strong evidence, I shall not believe that she is.” “It is reasonable,” said Mrs. Barclay, “that you should not think well of her without proof of her merit: neither ought you, without proof, to condemn her. She is as likely to be deserving as any other young girl Herbert knows.” This was rather what Mrs. Barclay wished than what she thought. She shared the suspicions of Alfred more largely than she would admit to herself. “Well, Alfred,” said Mr. Barclay, “it may be desirable that we should exercise some influence in this case; and it may be possible to find out whether it is desirable; and it may then be possible to exercise it. This is as far as we can get just now. In the mean while, instead of lamenting our inability, let us trust to the future. It is a wise saying that `fortune has a thousand eyes; fools only call her blind.' ” The reflections which this conversation occasioned in Alfred, were not confined to Herbert. A short time before, he had received a shock which at the moment prostrated him, and threatened to embitter his whole being. With the vehemence of a susceptible and uncalculating nature, he had permitted his feelings to become deeply pledged before he knew whether there was or could be any reciprocation; and had been for a time made to believe that there was, only to lift him the higher before his fall. Mr. Barclay felt strongly for his friend; but did not spare him. He sometimes administered consolation to Alfred in the manner in which the surgeon gives relief to the body. At times he would revile him, half in jest, for downright boyishness for such headlong self-abandonment: then he would chide him for ingratitude;— “you ought to pity her husband, poor man!— I'm sure I feel for him a great deal more than I do for you,” he would say. Such an opportunity as this conversation relating to Herbert he would not let escape; and, accordingly, a portion of what he said was aimed at Alfred, who readily appropriated it as it was intended; and being now in a state to examine his own feelings, and beginning to be ashamed of their extravagance, Mr. Barclay's observations wrought favourably on himself as well as on his concern for Herbert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. When Alfred walked out to Mr. Barclay's, Herbert, on parting from him, went to Langley's office. Thither he was in the habit of resorting daily; for Langley had completely succeeded in bringing about the intimacy he had sought. Herbert talked to him freely and listened credulously. He was confidential,—often without knowing it; and when Langley, speaking of himself, described emotions of which his mind was incapable, motives foreign to his nature, doings where he exaggerated his own importance, plans of public interest in which himself was to be the chief mover, Herbert felt pleased with the intimacy and gratified with the confidence of one, whose feelings were so noble and whose influence was so extensive. Langley bore 8* himself towards Herbert in the manner best calculated to win his confidence and his good opinion. The direct flattery which the weak or egotistical absorb with self-complacency, and which the obsequious hacks, self-hired to fortune, pour into the ears of the veteran favorites of Mammon, to stimulate their vulgar susceptibilities, he perceived would nauseate Herbert, who, though unpractised in the detection of design, possessed a natural delicacy and modesty that rejected what was gross, however and whence-ever presented. Langley did not flatter him,—he flattered his feelings. He affected sympathy with his desires. He met the utterance of his undefiled emotions with such responsive precision, that Herbert mistook the wordy echo for a soul-pulsating accord. Thus, within a week after their first meeting, they were on a footing of friendly association. Herbert was more with Langley than with Alfred Grey. Alfred held himself aloof from the circle of, what he called, frivolous ambition, into the centre of which Herbert had been so suddenly attracted. Warm in his feelings, and refined in his tastes, he avoided the shallow intercourse which satisfied neither. He was annoyed that Herbert, whom he believed to be capable of high things, should take so much pleasure in superficial amusement. Herbert, in a delightful animation from the novelty and liveliness of the scenes in which he found himself a prominent actor, felt his excitement dulled by the tone of Alfred, who mingled with the damnatory remarks on fashionable society, which jarred the present feelings of Herbert, personal satire on his associates which piqued him. He, therefore, did not seek Alfred so much as he at first had done; but gave most of the time that was unconsumed by dinners, balls, and visiting, to Langley, who not only had made a very favorable impression on him, but in whom he always found a ready ear and responding tongue. An unconscious cause of the attractiveness of Langley's society to him, was one of the subjects of their daily chat, which Langley never failed to introduce. Langley, who had closely watched Herbert and Miss Walsall in public, let no opportunity escape when alone with Herbert of probing his feelings; and the growing pleasure he perceived Herbert to evince when Miss Walsall was the theme of their social dialogue, confirmed him in the unwelcome conclusion to which observation in company had led. The effect of Langley's first suspicion of an inclination in Herbert towards Miss Walsall was to determine him to be guarded in his own attentions. For a moment he considered whether he could not repulse Herbert's first advance by an open and bold demonstration on his own part; but he immediately reflected, that even should Herbert's modesty co-operate with this plan, Miss Walsall would frustrate it; for that she would not suffer a young man, so calculated to gratify her fondness of admiration, to be withdrawn from her through his own timidity. Moreover, he feared the effect of such a course upon her disposition towards himself: he had as yet no hold upon her feelings, and he judged that one could only be obtained gradually and with slow art. The obstacle which Langley saw thus unexpectedly thrust in his way, far from discouraging him from prosecuting his new scheme, stimulated his resolution; for he was in all things enterprising; and the selfishness which suggested the design, incited him, by another impulse of its flexible activity, to thwart any one who might, however innocently, balk its execution. He risked nothing, and the defeat of a rival wonld swell the pleasure of triumph. When Herbert entered Langley's office, he found Mr. Penniman there. Langley, obobserving that Herbert hesitated whether he should not retire, exclaimed:—“We have finished our business; come in. You are just in time to save us from the sin of scandal, for we were talking of you; and 'twould have been rare if a fashionable man like Penniman had spoken five minutes of a third person without saying some harm of him.” “I confess,” said Mr. Penniman, “I was about to vent some bachelor indignation on you. What a shame, that a bright young fellow like you should hide your light under the bushel of matrimony. I hope, though, it is only the tattle of this gossiping town.” “Mr. Grey was telling me, not ten minutes since,” said Herbert, “that as the newest comer, I must submit to receive a large share of—” “—The braying of the asses and the hissing of the geese. That was his phraseology, was it not?” interrupted Penniman. “Your friend Grey says, that gossip begotten of idleness by malice is nurtured by ignorance: he is a fellow of most unsavory similes. But seriously, Barclay, I am concerned,—not on your account, for I'll make no affection of that sort,—but on my own, that you should think of following the common herd into the pen of marriage. I should be sorry to part company with you. A man is obliged to turn selfish in self-defence when he is married.— You would be totally lost, too, to the world. It's a pity a promising fellow like you should be so soon spoilt in that way. Take you pleasure first. Where do you see happier men than myself and Langley? A little love, like a little wine, raises a man's spirits very pleasantly; but matrimony is an excess of it, which, like a debauch, sinks him below par.” “Why Penniman,” said Langley, “since when have you turned misogamist? I have heard you discourse quite musically in a different key, and that not many months back.” “The report then is true,” rejoined Penniman, “that you, too, are in the sentimental vein just now. Well, I have some influence with Miss Walsall, and I shall use it to defeat you both.” “Miss Walsall!” exclaimed Herbert involuntary. “Ha! ha! ha! Here you have a specimen of the impertinence and veracity of a gossip,” said Langley. “Impertinence, forsooth!” cried Penniman. “Yes: impertinence to Miss Walsall,” said Langley. “Such a report is nothing to me—” “It seems to be something to our friend Barclay,” said Penniman. “And I suspect it will be something to Mary Walsall. We shall all meet at the Doctor's this evening, and I'll ask her. She shall know, too, Langley, of your gallant indignation at the impertinence of the town towards her for believing that she has added you to the list of her lovers.” “You are incorrigible, Penniman,” said Langley. “When you know him as well as I do, Mr. Barclay, you wo'nt mind what he says.” “Mr. Barclay wo'nt mind what any body says,” said Penniman, “when he knows the world as well as we do, Langley: he'll learn to set the eyes to watch the ears. I never believe what I hear; only what I see. This is a golden rule, Barclay. It makes one independent.” “But it is an independence like that of the hermit,” said Langley, “who needs nothing because he gives nothing. If you consort with your fellow-men, they must put faith in you, and you in them; and, putting faith in them, you must believe their words. To gain independence by distrust, is as if you drowned yourself for the pleasure of a bath.” “Aye, but I do'nt drown myself,” answered Penniman; “and for this very reason,— that I freight not my bark in partnership.— The entanglements of the passions and the dependences of confidence are the shoals and rocks that wreck happiness. I float buoyantly on the surface of life, taking my pleasure, not deeply, but gaily, and safely,—and what is not safe is not pleasure. For this I need neither to trust nor to be trusted. The world is to me my inn where I take my ease, and pay for it.” 9 “What the cold service of an inn is to the comfort of the private fireside,” said Langley, “such is the enjoyment of mercenary pleasure to the steady happiness of hearty affection. And, even were it possible to buy the best pleasures with money, how few are there who could possess them: the daily labor of most is just sufficient to earn the necessaries of life. But nature's laws are not so niggard, as that the happiness of man should be dependent upon the amassing of a superfluity. Within himself he bears the seed of enjoyment, which, rightly cultivated, brings forth richly without the manure of outward wealth.” “Nor does nature,” said Penniman, “prohibit me from using the means I possess after my own fashion for my own pleasure. She prohibits the abuse of every thing. If I injure no one, I commit no abuse. And I avoid committing any, because my gratifications are independent of others' interests.— The temptations to selfishness—to sacrifice others to ourselves—are little in my way, because I depend not on others' feelings and wishes nor they on mine. My pleasure gives pain to no one. I let the world take its course and I take mine; and surely, if each one in it made himself as contented as I am, t'would be a happier world than it is. To effect the general happiness, the best means is for every individual to provide for himself and let others alone.” “This is impossible,” said Langley. “Let a man centre his wants and pleasures as pointedly in himself as the most exclusive selfishness can demand; still, singly, he not only cannot provide for himself, but he will affect the being of the most unconscious ministers to his gratification. He cannot let others alone. Though all around him are willing hirelings that he pays daily, still, he binds himself to them and they to him: the bond is mutual interest. A chain joins them, though it be the artificial chain of gold.— This conducts the spirit of sympathy, which, as I have heard your uncle say, Mr. Barclay, pervades the whole human race, constituting it ONE, present in every individual of the universal whole, now manifesting itself in intense lightning, and now exhibiting its power by the moral languor which attends its feeble action, but never totally absent in any sane being.”— Here the conversation was arrested by the entrance of one of Langley's clients. To neither of them was the interruption unacceptable. Penniman had not zeal enough to take interest in an abstract discussion, and was beginning to feel the prolonging of it a bore. He immediately rose, telling Langley as he went out, that he would leave him to the “amassing of a superfluity.” Langley cared as little as Penniman for the solution of a moral problem; for, of the native worth and majestic beauty of truth, he had as clear a sense as the trader had of honesty, who at the end of a prosperous career declared that “cheating does'nt thrive; honesty is the best policy: I have tried both.” But he was of an active mind that grappled willingly with any subject, and being ambitious, he was ever eager to join issue where there was opportunity for display. His intellect was cultivated, and where his own resources failed, his good memory supplied him with the opinions of others, which he quoted with or without acknowledgment according to circumstances. He had given this turn to the conversation to evade the bantering of Penniman, and was glad to make his escape complete. To Herbert, the interruption was a grateful relief. The intimation from Penniman that Langley was a lover of Miss Walsall, was a revelation to him. He thought not of Langley. Jealousy was the unseen torch that flamed an accumulated heat in his bosom,—itself was enveloped in the sudden glare it caused. His own feelings were, as by a flash of lightning, made known to him. He loved Miss Walsall. He walked from Langley's office into the street as if transformed: 9* he knew not himself. A change was suddenly wrought in him that confused him with a mysterious delight. He walked on unconscious of volition in a dim abstraction. Ordinary objects passed before him with the lifeless aspect of a dream's creations. He had gone beyond the confines of the town before his mind awoke to distinct consciousness. He turned back with a light step. In a few moments he was at Dr. Walsall's door. On entering, he found Langley with Miss Walsall. He was startled. In Langley's expression, embarrassment followed surprise. Miss Walsall was alone collected. A smile spread over her soft countenance between her two lovers, as if it grew from their discontent. Herbert instantly recovered his self-possession. His discomposure was superficial. The impulse within him was at that moment too strong to be susceptible of check from without. He engaged in conversation with vivacity. Miss Walsall's manner in company was fascinating. To calm self-command—the armor of a lady—was united in her a confiding ease which held the attention her beauty attracted. An expression of pleasure spoke from her countenance more engagingly than words to those who conversed with her; and the attentiveness which proved its sincerity, won still more by its own charm. Her eye drew to itself the gaze by its transparence: the beholder, deluded by its lucid intentness, ever looked to it for more than her words conveyed. She followed rather than led in conversation, which she supported more by the encouragement she gave to others than by direct contribution. She captivated through her ear rather than through her tongue.— Some of her companions were more lively or more copious talkers; but she was unequalled as a listener. The wish to please—the predominant one in her nature—was never stronger than on this occasion. The attentions of Langley were no longer equivocal, and Herbert's interest in her was equally manifest. She greeted him in her most winning manner.— The animation of Herbert soon communicated itself,—to her, through her ready facility in harmonising with the mood of others,—and to Langley, through rivalry. Langley had never seen Herbert so voluble. He could not but attribute the change to art. The discovery made through Penniman to Herbert, that he, Langley, was a lover of Miss Walsall, he inferred had determined Herbert to urge his suit more vigorously, and that under this influence he had hastened to see her now, though he was, by invitation, to be at her house in the evening. The hearty spirit of Herbert's conversation, he regarded as the result of this sudden determination. He himself was actuated by a similar motive, and although too sagacious to judge Herbert by himself, he was of too cold a constitution to ascribe such an effect to the spontaneous glow of feeling, even had his knowledge of Herbert's state of mind been more definite than it was. However mistaken as to the immediate cause of Herbert's visit and conduct, he knew how to shape his own course in reference to them, and accordingly, he at once raised his mind to a pitch corresponding to that of Herbert's; for he was capable of marshalling in a moment his own powers to meet circumstances, although the impulse which moved such a nature as Herbert's was not always within the scope of his penetration.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. Herbert returned to his uncle's to dinner. Mrs. Barclay was out of doors and met him near the house. He eagerly unbosomed himself to his aunt. She questioned him freely, and as freely imparted to him her impressions. They did not join Alfred and Mr. Barclay until after a full disclosure on the part of Herbert of the state of his feelings, and a candid setting forth by his aunt of the risk he would encounter by a precipitate surrender to them. She neither encouraged nor discouraged him; but by affectionate interest and frank discussion, she becalmed his mind.— Without jarring it, she altered its tone. The deep vibrations of unpractised feeling, she accompanied with the clear firm notes of her own well-tempered mind, with so much skill and delicacy, that Herbert from listening with interest soon yielded to their influence. The fact that Langley was a rival of Herbert, which the latter did not seem yet distinctly to realize, was to her, satisfactory intelligence. Herbert's happy state of mind made no appeal to her immediate sympathy, so that her whole concern for him was concentrated upon his ultimate welfare; and with her misgivings respecting the fitness of Miss Walsall to promote this, the inference she made from Herbert's relation as to the designs of Langley, was an agreeable accompaniment to the report he gave of himself; as, in addition to ordinary chances, it presented a particular opening through which Miss Walsall's destiny might be separated from his. The conversation with his aunt was a present relief to Herbert's full bosom, and nothing was said to either his uncle or Alfred Grey. Herbert, though from the cause already stated he was somewhat weaned from daily intercourse with Alfred, enjoyed the latter's society, particularly at his uncle's, where he always listened with pleasure to their conversation, and took part in it without restraint. “Herbert,” said Mr. Barclay after dinner, “Alfred and I have been talking this morning of you and some of your acquaintances—” “If Mr. Grey,” said Herbert, “talks to you of them, uncle, as he does to me, you will think that I am keeping bad company.” “I have provoked you, Herbert,” said Alfred, “by laughing at most of them; but I challenge you to name one of whom I have said any serious harm.” “Well—silly company,” said Herbert. “Right,” said Alfred. “And that has vexed you. If I had condemned instead of ridiculing them, you would have minded less what I said.” “You would, I dare say, have been as correct in the one case as in the other,” said Herbert. “I do'nt find that these people deserve your satire.” “It is well that you do not, Herbert,” returned Alfred. “It is impossible that you should know them on so short and superficial an acquaintance; so that, your concurring with me, would betoken a proneness to fault-finding by no means commendable. I must, however, defend myself against your interpretations. Your self-love, piqued by my low estimate of what to you seemed attractive, has attributed to my ridicule a bitterness which was not in it.” “Nothing, Herbert,” said Mr. Barclay, “is more essential to success and happiness in life than a clear insight into the nature of those with whom we associate; and you will find, that to estimate justly the characters of men, you must at first be chary of good opinion. If you over-rate them at the outset, the discovery of the error is apt to produce a greater, hurrying you as much below the truth as you were before above it; and when the discovery is made through personal disappointment, as it often is, the re-action is the stronger.” 10 “And into error of this kind,” said Alfred, “you are the more likely to be seduced, from the nature of your present association with people. You see them only at times when they are robed for public exhibition,—when they have put on smiles,—when they are playing a part,—when their behavior is a masquerade. The clean, shaven citizen gaily recreating himself on a Sunday, you would not recognize in the sweating laborer at his toil.” “How can it be otherwise?” said Herbert. “I have been but a few weeks in society. It is impossible, as you say, for me to become acquainted in so short a time. Every thing is new to me,—the people, the places where I meet them, the manner of meeting them. But by degrees I shall learn to known them better.” “Very true,” said Alfred. “But you will not attain to this knowledge neither so certainly nor so quickly if you begin with admitting impressions wide of the truth. And do you not, while acknowledging your inability to know at present the real characters of your new acquaintances, bear in your mind decided opinions concerning them? You are not merely ignorant—you are deceived.” “It is difficult,” said Herbert, “not to form an opinion of a person you meet often, however you may want the means of judging rightly.” “Not,” answered Alfred, “if you carry with you the conviction that you do want these means. Thus guarded, you will not be betrayed into a hasty judgment.” “In associating with your fellow-men, Herbert,” said Mr. Barclay, “you should seek to place yourself on an equality with them. Now, you are at a great disadvantage, if you trust without knowledge. In imputing evil blindly, you do yourself a negative injury—you forfeit probable advantage; but in expecting good where it is not, you expose yourself to positive loss. You are deceived, injured, ruined perhaps, and no one is benefited. To think well of men, and to do them good, are not only distinct, but often opposed; for, by misplacing confidence, you may cripple yourself, and thus baffle your benevolent purpose.” “But, uncle,” said Herbert, “I have heard you say, it is only by experiencing the bad effects of unwise conduct that we gain wisdom; that one can only learn to live by practice, and that in learning, mistakes, disappointment, suffering, are unavoidable; that truth can only be reached through error.” “Nor is what I have just said,” answered Mr. Barclay, “in contradiction with this.— Were you far more sagacious and prudent than you are, and more willing and able to guide yourself by the instructions of the experienced, than the best-disposed of your age, you would still commit blunder on blunder, and have to atone for them by chargin and pain. In the best minds judgment is not intuitive, nor to the most docile can it be transferred. Gradually, through personal endeavor only, is it to be acquired; and in this process of active trial, frequent must be failure to the most vigilant and cautious. Every step involves a double danger: you are ever liable to err in taking it, and your position is liable to be assailed. Contention is a condition of life. The philanthropist—unless he be a mere dreamer—as well as the rude bandit, must contend. The worker, whether of good or evil, must attack and defend. Thus exposed, whatever may be your career, from without and within, can you be too wary? Even to those skilled by repeated encounter, the perils of life are formidable; what must they be to you, ignorant of their source and nature? Your safety lies in taking, at first, short steps: long ones will carry you into the dark, where you may meet a blow that will stun you, or, have a load put on you that will burden your energies, or, encircle yourself with a wreath from which the flowers will soon fall leaving the chain they concealed to cramp your liberty for life.” Whenever Mr. Barclay talked, he had in 10* Herbert an attentive listener. The report respecting Miss Walsall had put him in a mood to urge upon Herbert more pointedly than he was wont to do, the necessity of circumspection; and while he, under this influence, forcibly represented the dangers that beset the beginner in the world, Herbert eagerly hearkened to his words, and with such conviction of their importance, that he resolved that very evening to derive benefit from them, and to observe closely Miss Walsall and Langley. He doubted not that he could do it. He set off with Alfred to return to town, and Mr. Barclay walked some distance with them. When, after emerging from the wood that enclosed the lawn, they reached the elevation already mentioned, which overlooked the city and surrounding country:—“I seldom,” said Alfred, “pass this spot that I do not pause on it. Without being picturesque, the scene is one to dwell upon. A wide expanse of teeming field and rich woodland with a large city sprung up in the midst of it, and on one side the landscape stretching far away without boundary and losing itself in the vague level of the horizon.” “Does not its boundlessness tempt you?” said Mr. Barclay. “I believe, Alfred, you have never been beyond the little world which the eye from this point embraces.” “No: I have not,” answered Alfred.— “And it is seldom that I feel a wish to go beyond it. It is, as you have called it, a little world, and affords full scope to one whose desires are not for power. Nor have I, except to behold a few sacred spots, curiosity to see more of the surface of the earth or of the people who live on it.” “I hope that you are mistaken in yourself,” said Mr. Barclay; “and that there is a latent disposition in you that will make a traveller of you yet; for I have built a castle in the air according to which, you and Herbert are to make a tour together. What do you say, Herbert?” Herbert said nothing, as he had himself laid the foundation of a fine castle of a very different character. “I have nothing against such a plan,” said Alfred. “Herbert and I will talk it over one of these days. No doubt you and Keppel could say enough to start us both. I expect Keppel this evening, and if he comes I'll bring him with me to-morrow.” “Ah! he's a traveller,” said Mr. Barclay.— “Come out early, Alfred; your friend and I will have much to say to each other.” Herbert and Alfred continued their way to town. Herbert told his friend, as he had told his aunt, what had passed in the morning. “Langley is a scoundrel,” warmly exclaimed Alfred. “Herbert, I'll go with you to Dr. Walsall's this evening. Does Miss Walsall know, do you think, what are your feelings towards her?” “No: its impossible that she should.” “That is—you have never designedly told her of them. Did you or Langley leave her first this morning?” “I left Langley with her.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. Herbert and Alfred went to Miss Walsall's together. “Ha! Mr. Grey, this is an unlooked for pleasure,” cried Dr. Walsall, as they entered. “We owe you our thanks for it, Mr. Barclay,” said his daughter, as she received them with graceful ease and a smile directed to Alfred, which made his salutation warmer than he had prepared it. If the service which Alfred wished to do his friend, for whom his heart was overflowing with sympathy, was to have been rendered through personal interview with Miss Walsall, Herbert could not have had a weaker ally. Alfred was powerless before a fascinating woman. To the influence which a woman exercises over a man he was peculiarly susceptible; and when this power was wielded by beauty, all that was most impressible in his nature was acted on, and prudence and discernment were made captive. He was aware of his weakness in this point, and would often try to strengthen himself against it when out of the company of women, by boldly satirising the sex; but this spirit always deserted him in their presence. The cruel disappointment he had himself suffered from one, left no bitterness in his heart, though he said that it had; and whatever suspicion he may have endeavored to infuse into Herbert, and however earnestly he may have warned him against female art, the only feelings in his own mind at this moment towards the sex, were affection and admiration. He forgot the unfavorable impression he had taken up respecting Miss Walsall. Not so, however, with his feelings towards Langley, whose treachery he thought was evident from Herbert's account of their intimacy. His own opinion of his character gave strength to the suspicion. Langley was talking to Mrs. Vernon. Alfred went up to them, and in bowing to Langley fixed on him one of those full, searching looks, which a mean mind never can meet steadily. Langley cowered before it, and soon moved to another part of the room. “What is there between you and Mr. Langley, Alfred?” said Mrs. Vernon, when Langley had turned away. “Nothing: I hav'nt seen him for some time, and wished to admire his beautiful face. But he is as bashful as a girl,—he hung his head. He blushed too,—he can blush,—though the blood seems puzzled when it gets to his skin, what color to put on. See him now talking to Miss Walsall: he never lets a chance of profit escape, and has quickly availed himself of the glow on his cheek to appear ardent to his mistress, adorning the lover with the blush of the scoundrel.” “What is the matter, Alfred?” “Is not Langley a lover of Miss Walsall?” “Is he? why I was just now asking him about the report that your friend Herbert is.” “And what did he say?” “He said, he did'nt believe it.” They were interrupted by the approach of Mr. Penniman. “I am glad to see you turn out, Grey,” said he to Alfred. “This is your doing, my charming Mrs. Vernon—you are always doing some good. Where's you husband? He stays away, I suppose, to have the pleasure of hearing from a hundred people to-morrow, how beautiful you look this evening. Your young friend Barclay gets on famously, Grey—over head and ears in love already they say. Fine girl, Mary Walsall—very good manners too, considering: a winter in Paris would make a charming woman of her. Delightful party this—select. Difficult to have a select party here. Oh! there's that prattling Mrs. Smith just come in—I must go in and speak to her.” “Puppy!” exclaimed Alfred after he had gone. 11 In the mean time, Herbert was trying to be “agreeable.” He was generally pleasing in company. A natural flow of spirits overcame a more than usual degree of timidity, and gave a play to his fine talents. But now the sources of all excitement were absorbed by one spring which boiled within him; and not having learnt to talk as a business, he was obliged soon to turn away from the group he had joined on entering the room. He approached Miss Walsall, to whom Langley was talking with the same kind of animation which he assumed to address a jury—heightened by his conviction of the importance and doubtfulness of the cause he was pleading. The spirit that had spoken forth so eloquently from Herbert in the morning, was fled: what had then inspired him, oppressed him now: the bright flame,— the first outburst of passion,—had subsided, and his now undazzled eyes began to see the shadows which the light within him cast. Reflection, had brought suspicion, jealousy, fear. The advances of Miss Walsall,—for a young hostess can expand the duties of hospitality so as to cover a great extent of encouragement,—though not without effect, had not the power to excite him to a renewal of the conversational rivalry he had so unconsciously engaged in a few hours before. He shrank, too, from a public competition of the kind: he was withheld by intuitive delicacy from making such a display of his feelings. So that, after a few common-place observations, much to the disappointment of Miss Walsall, and triumph of Langley, he passed on, and took a seat by Mrs. Vernon. Langley had come with the determination to make his public debut as a lover of Miss Walsall. He was, accordingly, constant and pointed in his attentions to her. Nor did he neglect to pay court to her father, artfully mingling with flattery, insinuations and representations of his own importance, so as to leave the Doctor as strongly impressed with his merit, as he was satisfied with himself. “I have never seen Miss Walsall look so well. Is'nt she beautiful?” said Mrs. Vernon to Mr. Seldon. “Why—yes,” answered Mr. Seldon hesitatingly. “But I admire Miss Astly more.” “You don't think her beautiful?” “No: not beautiful,” said Mr. Seldon.— “But better than beautiful. She looks as if she knew who her great grand-father was.” “Ha! ha! I'm sure I dont know who mine was,” said Mrs. Vernon. “I know who all your great grand-fathers were,” said Mr. Seldon. “I like a blooded lady—” “Mrs. Smith has sent me, Mr. Seldon, to request that you will come to her in the other room,” said Mr. Penniman, coming up and interrupting him. “She says, she has a question of importance to ask you.” “A question of importance?” repeated Mr. Seldon. “No doubt, a genealogical one, Seldon,” said Alfred to him as he walked away with Mr. Penniman. “Poor Seldon!” continued Alfred, when they were out of hearing. “To be obliged to obey the summons of a baker's daughter delivered by a tanner's son at a select soirée! No wonder he is pale and thin. His fine blood retreats from the surface to avoid contact with such thick humored plebeians. Well, he is very absurd; but he is not disgusting like Penniman. Any thing is more bearable than the self-complacence of a money-bloated upstart,—a would-be exclusive. An aristocrat like Seldon, is a mistaken man here; but the other is contemptible,—contemptible from the impotence of his vulgar ambition. I believe I'll take pity on Seldon, and go and share with him the stripes of Mrs. Smith's tongue.” Dr. Walsall and his daughter acquitted themselves with the ease of frequent practice. When the Doctor gave a dinner or a party, he thought he was performing a high duty. Such entertainments he looked upon as constituent parts of elevated social existence; 11* and deeming himself one of the most responsible members of society, he felt bound to repeat them often. No doer of charity, after a day of benevolent exertion, retired to rest with a more self-approving conscience, than did the Doctor after a ball at his house. He felt as if he had done that which it had been appointed him to do. He certainly did it well. He was a man of a fine presence, well built, and always well dressed, with manners formal but courteous, in which professional dignity combined with, and in a measure qualified, a natural tendency to pompousness. His fondness for hearing his own voice he could indulge on an occasion like this, innocently, the numerousness of the company who shared his attention as host, averting from each individual a burdensome proportion of it. “I've just been giving your daughter some good advice, Doctor,” said Mr. Penniman to him, “which I know will have your sanction.” “What is that?” asked the Doctor. “To continue to be an ornament to these handsome rooms, for at least a half a dozen years yet.” “Sanction such advice,—that I will most cheerfully,” answered the Doctor. “So uncivilized are we in America,” continued Mr. Penniman, “that the only chance a fine woman has of enjoying herself, or doing her duty by society, is to keep single for a short time after she is out of her teens.— Marriage is here the Styx of fashionable life. Just as a beautiful girl is beginning to shed her full radiance upon the world, she is snatched off by some youngster,—who probably is'nt worth a copper,—and you never see her again, and forget her existence, until you are reminded of it by meeting her fine eyes staring at you from the head of a dirty-faced imp in the street.” “What you say, is in a degree true,” replied the Doctor. “But a good deal may be said in explanation and vindication of our custom in this respect. In the first place, there are exceptions—” “Yes,” interrupted Mr. Penniman, “and yonder is one of them. See there, the lovely Mrs. Vernon left alone—isolated—absolutely isolated. Where else could that happen? Excuse me Doctor but I must go and join her.” Notwithstanding the doubts and fears which Herbert had brought with him, after the conversations with his aunt, with Alfred and Mr. Barclay, and finally with Alfred alone, he passed a happy evening. So fluctuating are the feelings of a lover. Despondence was not of his age or his nature. Jealousy could keep no hold in his bosom. He soon forgot to think of the future—to think at all. He gave himself up to the delicious enjoyment of the feeling whose birth was a re-creation of his being. He yielded to its power as unresistingly as the young forest bends to the breeze that visits it with purity and strength. He gave no utterance to his feelings. His words to Miss Walsall were the words of ordinary civility—not more frequently addressed to her by him than by the most unmoved of her guests. She was before him, not as she was before others, but as the embodiment of his love-illumined fancy. She seemed an emanation from himself,—an Eve taken from his side. Her voice was the sweet echo to his inaudible communings. Her form floated before him as though it had grown out of a rich dream. So vividly and fixedly was her image impressed upon his mind, that it became part of it; and when he went away, it continued as distinctly present to him as it had been in the rooms he had left.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. The next day Alfred went to Mr. Barclay's, accompanied by his friend Mr. Keppel, who, as he expected, had arrived the evening before. Herbert had had in the morning with his uncle a conversation relating to himself. He will fully understand the impression made by such a conversation, who has experienced when in trouble, the influence of one whose wish to serve does not defeat itself by over-heated zeal; but who, uniting warm fellow-feeling with self-possession, is as able as he is willing to give his friend the benefit of a clear judgment. Mr. Barclay was such a friend to Herbert. The difference of their ages was only felt by Herbert in the superiority of his uncle's experience; while their relationship gave a sanctity to the affection of Mr. Barclay. Herbert was far, however, from believing himself in trouble; nor did he apply to his uncle for mere advice. But he found himself suddenly in a new situation which, though full of delight, perplexed him by its novelty; and whenever any thing interested him, no matter what was its nature or importance, to his uncle he immediately went to talk of it and hear his opinion. This attractive power in Mr. Barclay was the effect as much of the benevolence and benign religious confidence, as of the intelligence of his mind. His varied experience,— in which constant active endeavor, while daily accomplishing the practical ends of life, had corrected and deepened the theoretical principles of a meditative and comprehensive intellect,—was enriched by a strong inborn reliance, a confiding trust in the inscrutable power, by whose law the deeds of man are begun and ended. This inward faith, far from causing distrust of the efficacy of human effort, drew to itself strength from the observed results of the latter; for the connexion between success and well-directed energy was to him so obvious, as to establish the conviction, that the existence of prosperity is dependent upon wisdom and exertion,—as if the decree for man's happiness (whatever may be the other conditions of its fulfilment) was not issued until he had been seen to labor. Confidence in the future, therefore, although there was in him a strong natural tendency to it, had become so connected with the inferences of reason, that it was a stimulant to activity, instead of producing, as it is apt to do, the contrary effect. He relied first upon what he could understand and control—his personal means; his reliance upon what he could not, serving both to encourage his efforts and to weaken the force of disappointment when they were baffled. Herbert could not anticipate what would be the nature of his uncle's remarks: he only felt sure that he should find satisfaction in them. This expectation was fully realized. Indeed, the sympathy of such a man was a support; and had the words of his uncle conveyed nothing more definite than the assurance of this, Herbert would have been satisfied. Joyful to both was the meeting between Mr. Barclay and Mr. Keppel. The former deluged the latter with questions about acquaintances; for, from congeniality of tastes, they had many in common, and in every country he had visited, Mr. Barclay had wisely established correspondences, which he still kept up. After an hour of pleasant chat the little party went to dinner. “Why Elizabeth,” said Mr. Barclay, “you seem to have presumed that our friend has returned an epicure.” “Your table, Mrs. Barclay,” said Mr. Keppel, “verifies a remark I once heard from one of that class, that cooking was a type of refinement.” 12 “One of those remarks,” said Mr. Barclay, “which having a semblance of truth, are by many mistaken for true.” “Yes,” said Mr. Keppel, “there is a connexion; and though my epicurean friend did know that it was collateral, several who heard him did not. You recollect the anecdote of the traveller who, journeying through a region possessed by savages, rejoiced at the sight of a gallows, as an assurance that he had reached a civilized people:—the sight of a truffled turkey would have authorized the same agreeable inference.” “There is however,” said Mr. Barclay, “a serious error that has taken root even among the cultivated, on which the playful remark of your friend may be taken as satire—the opinion, that the state of the fine arts is an index of the degree of general refinement; an opinion derived from the radical mistake of believing the sense of the beautiful and the sense of the moral to be dependent upon one and the same element of mind.” “And to the diffusion of this error,” said Mr. Keppel, “I think the great German Goethe has much contributed.” “He himself, however,” said Mr. Barclay, “does not entertain it.” “No,” said Mr. Keppel; “and that he is believed to be authority for it, proceeds from a misapprehension of him. His works are so strongly tinctured with his fondness for the fine arts, and are so much indebted for excellence to their spirit, that the means of successful execution are mistaken for the end of composition, and that which was secondary and subordinate in the mind of the author, appears to many to be primary in his works.” “Do you think, Mr. Keppel,” said Alfred, a short time after, giving another turn to the conversation, “that a young man can receive much benefit from travel?” “A young man,” answered Mr. Keppel, “may reap much good. But besides that he is not so likely to use his means of improvement so well as at a maturer age, these means themselves are greatly less at twenty than at thirty. To learn by travel, a good deal must already have been learnt. A stock of acquirement, as well as a certain maturity of thought, both of which presuppose some years of manhood,—are needed, in order to gather up the various knowledge that is to be gathered; a perception, too, searching and discriminating through exercise and self-examination, and capacious from extensive study. There must be a solid nucleus of knowledge, to collect kindred stuff; otherwise, many rich grains will be touched but not attracted,—much will be seen and heard unheeded, because its significance is unsuspected. In answering your question, I suppose a man eager for improvement, who can choose his time.” “The chief want of a young American traveller,” said Mr. Barclay, “is the want of knowledge of his own country. His memory is burdened with a heap of dead fragments of Greek and Roman doings and writings, while he is left ignorant of, utterly uninstructed in, the nature of the institutions that surround him in living entireness, acting daily upon and interwoven with his individual being; an acquaintance with whose conditions and principles is to him more important, a thousand fold, than the most thorough knowledge (even could he obtain such) of the circumstances and laws of all the nations of antiquity; which, too, independently of the practical value of acquaintance with them, are in themselves, as subjects of abstract study, far more fruitful of instruction than ancient institutions, being, unlike the latter, not approachable only through the imperfect record of a foreign tongue, but visibly present in moving fluctuating operation, directly cognizable in their details, ramifications, beginnings and consequences.” “But, uncle,” said Herbert, “should not the foundation of a liberal education be laid with the knowledge of the history and literature of the two nations who reached such a 12* height of power and civilization—who have exercised such an influence over the world? Is not the study of them the best beginning?” “But, Herbert,” answered Mr. Barclay, “a beginning cannot be made with them; because the young mind cannot reach them. There is the great error. With much toil you get little fruit. It is like trying to collect water in a sieve. The history and literature of a people are entirely beyond the capacity of a school-boy. He is not instructed—he is not educated, by learning by rote, a meagre sketch of its existence, and the shell of its language. The principle of adaptation of means to the end is utterly disregarded: it is attempted to make a beginning with that which should be the conclusion; precious time is thus wasted, and no substantial beginning—no foundation is made. What might be learnt best, and therefore should be learnt, is neglected for the sake of that which cannot be learnt. The young mind is translated to a distant age on the heavy wings of verbal memory: its whole power is expended in moving the wings. And you are kept at this barren labor, while rich materials, suit able to your capacity, apt to exercise various powers, and to fix in the mind useful facts and distinct images, lie around you neglected. Your attention is tasked to seize that which, from its remoteness, its dissimilarity to all that surrounds you, its foreignness to all that interests you, and from the indirect way (through books) that it is presented, you cannot even realize to be a substantial existence. The physically obvious, the teeming present, inviting you with a living voice that speaks to the affections as well as to the curiosity, is uncommuned with; and you are toiled in pursuit of the vague phantoms of extinct existences that answer coldly and indistinctly to your laborious appeals. Yourself, Herbert, what have you learnt of the people among whom you have lived for the last four years? What do you know of the laws and customs of the town whose streets were as familiar to you as the passages of this house— of the origin and operation of these; of its political and social institutions and their principles—of the differences between them and those of your native place; of the constitution and its framers, the history and the men who moulded it, of the state under whose protection you studied? Neither, of the spirit of the community where you abode, nor even of the forms of its organization, were you taught any thing. As a student, you lived out of the precincts of real life, pondering over the strange signs of unintelligible ideas; as if a man who had to provide food for his dinner, should, instead of setting to work with his hands, spend the morning in speculating on the phantasms of his last night's dream. “Language being the signs of things, ideas and feelings, is subordinate to these, is dependent upon them, grows out of them. The manner of its formation points both to the reason for acquiring it and to the method of acquisition. As words come into existence, viz.—to represent things, &amp;c. so they should come into the mind of the learner.— They are not knowledge, but the symbols of knowledge; they should, therefore, follow not precede it. The reverse of this natural course is taken, as well in the branches of instruction in the native language as in those called classical. In the latter, not only is language taught as if it were the creator of ideas, instead of being created by them; but this preposterous end is pursued by means in which art, far from aiding nature, strives against her; for, not only is the symbolic, secondary character of words lost sight of it, but the mistake thereby committed is doubled by making words, themselves not recognized as symbols, the symbols of other words.— The boy of fourteen who translates Horace, learns that certain Latin words, correspond to certain English ones—and that is all that he does learn. And what do his lessons of ancient history teach him? That war is the condition of humanity; that the first of warriors is the greatest of men; that courage and pride are cardinal virtues; that ambition is exalted; that power is the proper aim of statesmen, and conquest of states. To you, Herbert, ancient history has been only a tale of war—the story of Jack the giant-killer of childhood adapted to boyhood. All of it that was intelligible to you was the movements of fleets and armies, victory and defeat, sieges and massacres—the most general effects of the commonest passions. Too few and isolated are the acts of virtue to give a brighter color to the image painted on your mind—unconsciously perhaps to yourself— that man is a warfaring, treacherous, revengeful, superstitious, tumultuous, animal. “This false system—false in its aims, and false in the mode to attain them—is as artificial as if human ingenuity in building it up, had striven to outdo nature by opposing her. The course which she, ever simple and uniform, prescribes, may be learnt from an infant. In its unconscious development is legible the principle which should be the basis of education. Every object within its reach it examines earnestly: it is eager to look into every thing it can put its hands on. To feed its curiosity, it crawls and walks and climbs. Its store of learning accumulating, and the wants of its mind becoming more distinct and multiplied, the need of signs to indicate, to label as it were, their classification, calls into action the innate power to create them; and language displays her mirror, bright and perfect, faithful to represent whatever is held before it, but in itself, nothing—casting back images, as images, complete, but only images—all idea and significance being in that which is imaged. To continue this process is the duty of the educator: to lead, and not to drive, is, as the word indicates, his vocation. He should encourage the spontaneous tendency of the young intellect, engaging it on that which is immediately around, which is tangible, which the senses, those natural instruments of acquisition, can reach; exciting it by gratifying its curiosity; delighting it with palpable results of its power; limiting his agency to the facilitating and methodising of its action. His function is, not to use his own mind to make impressions upon that of his pupil, but to make the latter develope itself. He is not to pour into it, or rather on it, the opinions and conclusions of others, but to keep it in the way of imbibing knowledge at the original sources thereof,—of self-instilling knowledge from the fresh products of nature. The space of a few miles square may embrace all these,—the physical world with its beauties and powers—living man in all the conditions and relations of his being—a complete theatre for instruction. Brooks and fields and hills contain the geography of the globe: the narration of a village's birth and growth is history: its municipal organization involves the principles of politics. Here the learner earns knowledge instead of borrowing it, and can realize that it is knowledge; for what he learns is a reality—not a memory; is incorporated with his mind—not impressed upon its surface. Such knowledge is a foundation; for it is adapted to a superstructure: it is a proper beginning; because it invites and facilitates continuance. From such a centre the young intellect will expand with its own growth eagerly to a wider sphere, calling to its aid, with a distinct appreciation of their legitimate purpose, books, as messengers between the mind and its objects, telescopes for the mind, to place before it through the media of mute signs that which on account of distance it cannot directly approach,—consulting them to extend not to originate information, and understanding them clearly from already possessing absolute definite knowledge similar to that which they display, and obtained at the same source. Acquirement thus made will feed itself: circle will be added to circle by the strengthening impulse of gratified curiosity: the conformity to nature will make the acquisition more substantial and the disposition to acquire more 13 active; until the learner, having penetrated to the latest results in science, and ascended in the history of man to the remotest record, shall have surveyed—as far as one mind can survey,—the workings of nature and the doings of man. And yet, what is the grasping power of intellect, thus beautifully taught to gather and to hold all outward forms and subtilest relations—what is it to the inward teaching—to the education of the feelings? This first want of a human being can by this process, and only by this, be fully satisfied. Self-knowledge can only be obtained—self-discipline accomplished, by action; and in childhood this course of action may and should be entered on. What is done by telling the pupil how he should act? Vain are many words. Make his own feelings tell him: make them their own instructors.— Place before him the objects—lead him into the situations, that shall move their deep fountains to overflowing. Use your power of control only to multiply opportunities— your art, only to add emphasis to the lessons of nature. In the family circle and in the little community around him, all these lessons are written, and there and thus may be easily learnt. Selfishness may be made to seem what it is, and be shunned as a torture. In the liquid flow of unchecked tenderness, love, reverence, justice, may have their birth in joy, not in pain: duty may be practised as a pleasure, not as a law: self-sacrifice may be felt as a giving to self, not as a taking away.” Mr. Barclay having been led into these remarks by the question of Herbert, was encouraged to express himself at such length by the evident interest with which he was listened to. When he paused, Mr. Keppel returned to the subject Alfred had introduced. “The traveller,” said Mr. Keppel, “who is not furnished with knowledge of the social usages and political institutions of his own country—their form and spirit—will find himself, from the want of a standard of comparison, imperfectly qualified to judge of those of others. Our countrymen sometimes carry with them prejudices against the countries they visit, instead of information on their own; and sometimes, on the other hand, the absence of theoretical knowledge (the only substantial basis for conviction) of the principles of the republicanism under whose influence they have lived, exposes them to be dazzled by the outward gorgeousness of foreign aristocracy.” “As travelling,” observed Alfred, “is said to have the effect of curing prejudice, most books of travels must be looked upon as transcripts from the traveller's mind when in the crisis of the process of cure; at which period, as in cures of the body, the disease about to be thrown off, rages with its greatest violence.” “To depict a civilized people,” said Mr. Keppel, “is a high literary and philosophical achievement; requiring, acquaintance with all the circumstances of its birth, growth and present being; insight into the spirit which is partly the cause and partly the effect of these; graphic skill, so as to paint picturesquely the outward appearance, the physiognomy of a nation—” “Stop,”—cried Alfred, “what you have said is quite enough to seal up all manuscript journals.” “By no means,” said Mr. Keppel. “But to judge of what is done, we must have in our mind a conception of what may be—an ideal standard, with which to compare the real production; and the more exalted that is, and consequently, the more difficult of approach, the more tolerant should we be of failure.” “That is a sound rule in morals, but not in literature,” said Mr. Barclay. “A bad man should be pitied and pardoned: a bad work is out of the sphere of charity. Of taste the fundamental law is severity—of morals, forgiveness. 13* Books of travels, however, are not as such, amenable to this law; for they are not (with few exceptions) works of elegant literature. They should be held in the light of papers called for by a legislative body.— They are documents and reports on manners, customs, statistics, politics, laid before the reading world by its order—drawn up with various merit, but all answering, according to their accuracy and fulness, the end of furnishing facts, descriptions, and conclusions in relation to far distant members of the human family.” “They follow,” said Mr. Keppel, “in the footsteps of the great civilizer, Commerce. And even one which betrays the mean spirit and shallow intellect of its author, may have a high value from its store of facts and its graphic descriptions, the inferences and impressions produced by these in the reader, being the reverse of those recorded by the industrious little-minded writer.” “Those who do not or cannot visit other countries themselves,” said Mr. Barclay, “may, through the works of those who do, in a measure share the benefits of travel, the chief of which is the tolerance of spirit created, in men capable of it, by learning how opposite are the opinions entertained on the same subjects by different communities. This moral effect is more to be prized than the accompanying enlargement of intellectual vision, produced by beholding questions from new points of view and through new modes of thought.” “It is with the traveller as with the student,” said Mr. Keppel. “Although it is both possible and profitable to obtain a considerable acquaintance with many subjects; thoroughly to master one, requires long and assiduous attention to that one. He who travels for the high object of instruction, (which embraces, by the by, the highest and most varied entertainment,) may learn much of all the countries he shall visit; but to penetrate deeply into the spirit of a people,—to understand its peculiar genius,—to work into his mind a clear picture of its individuality,— he must devote years to the study of it, and pursue the study, not with industry only, but with a genial zeal. I can speak here from experience. Having spent many years in different countries, I went to Italy with the determination to carry fully into practice a system I had partially followed every where. I had no knowledge of its language, and a superficial one of its history. I established myself in an unfrequented middle-sized town, and got admitted as lodger and boarder into the house of a respectable tradesman, having a large family. With this family I set out with identifying myself: I made myself one of it. From the children I learnt more of the language than from my grammar and dictionary. I played and talked with them, went with them to their schools and read their books. I entered into the feelings of the family as if I had been born a member of it. I shared its amusements and troubles and occupations. Through it I made my first acquaintances, cultivating intercourse with its friends and relations. In a short time I learnt with the language the history of half a dozen families. I was soon a favorite, from listening to every one's story, and taking an interest in every one's little pains and pleasures. In the mean time, I made daily progress in the study of the literature and history of Italy. I talked, read, wrote, thought, felt, nothing but Italian. In this way a year passed. I then removed to a large city.— Here I associated with a different class. My acquaintance with the language, customs, and literature enabled me to take the fullest advantage of the facilities for intimate association which letters and my American birth opened to me. I avoided foreigners and foreign subjects. I moved freely through a large circle, on the most familiar footing with many, living the life of a native. I made excursions to the country, spending weeks with my Italian friends at their villas, and taking note of the mode of life and condition of the peasantry. At the expiration of another year I left this city, and set out to visit every part of Italy, tarrying weeks or months in the principal towns, and continuing to unite with constant intercourse with the inhabitants, and the collecting of every kind of statistical information, the study of poetry and the fine arts in the spirit of a native. This consumed two years, making the entire term of my residence four, every week of which had been devoted intently to the study of the Italian people.” “And when you re-ascended the Alps,” said Mr. Barclay, “and took your last look at the Italian soil—” “It was a look of longing,” interrupted Mr. Keppel. “I wished to turn back and spend another year. I felt as if I had left much uncompleted.” “You liked the Italians then?” asked Herbert. “I have never known a people,” answered Mr. Keppel, “that I did not like.” “As, after what has been said, we have all, no doubt, our ideal standard of what a book of travels may be, pretty well elevated, and are therefore prepared to judge of a real production, suppose we have a specimen from the manuscript of a traveller,” said Alfred, drawing from his pocket a roll of paper. “Come Alfred,” said Mr. Keppel, “no treachery.” “Of course not,” said Alfred: “trust to my discrimination.” “Now you are going to bore us, Alfred,” said Mr. Keppel. “Bore you! well, what if I do! Every one should have his turn.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. Alfred opened the paper and read as follows: —“I had spent several weeks—as every one may spend them at Dresden—delightfully. It is one of the most charming towns in Europe. Far away from travellers' thoroughfares; free from the bustle of commerce, and the tramp and insolence of soldiery; a cultivated, polished society, over which the good-hearted, old-fashioned royal family diffuses additional courtesy; rich collections of the treasures of art, and curious hoards from antiquity; the best music; one of the finest galleries of paintings in the world; a beautiful country around;—all these form a whole of singular attractiveness, and makes Dresden a spot where the traveller, enjoying a luxurious repose, delights to linger. The summer was drawing to an end. I had staid a fortnight beyond the time I had fixed for continuing my journey south through Bohemia. Having at last resolutely made up my mind to set off in a few days, I took leave of my kind Dresden friends. Talking with one of them of the resources for amusement of his city—`Have you,' said he, `been at a boar hunt?' `A boar hunt! No. Are wild boars hunted near this?' `Yes,' said he. `The king has a hunt at stated times at this season: if you would like to see one, to-morrow is one of his days.' `I would'nt miss it for the world,' said I. `Then, send a horse to Moritzburg this afternoon; and ride out in a carriage to-morrow morning to breakfast: the hunt begins at eleven o'clock.'—`How fortunate,' said I to myself as I proceeded to a livery-stable to engage a horse, `how fortunate that I heard of this! A royal boar hunt away in the interior of Germany! What a rare chance for a traveller!' I examined 14 several horses, and having chosen one, recommended as strong and sure-footed, I ordered him to be sent out that afternoon to be fresh for me the following day. I provided myself with a good hunting sword and a pair of large pistols; and the next morning, after a two hours drive, I found myself at nine o'clock at the inn near the palace of Moritzburg, the royal hunting lodge. “After seeing to my horse, I went to breakfast. I was impatient for eleven o'clock to arrive. The anticipation of danger whetted my eagerness. I had read accounts of desperate fights between boars and their hunters, of narrow escapes, and chivalrous deeds— one of a king, whose life, in peril from a furious boar, was saved by a knight at the risk of his own. Perhaps, said I, something of the kind may happen to myself! Perhaps I may beat the king and his suite, and be the first to strike the animal! I examined my sword and pistols. But I must not be too bold; and one of Snyder's finest pictures, a foaming boar at bay, came into my mind.— In the mean time two other gentlemen had arrived at the inn, and were taking breakfast out of doors under a tree. As they talked loud and seemed to have no objection to be listened to, from the piazza a few feet above them could be heard distinctly their whole conversation, from which I learnt that they were two young Frenchmen, one of them attached to the French legation at Dresden, the other a student of Heidelberg. Their talk was of themselves and other Frenchmen, which at any other time might have interested me; but my mind was now too much pre-occupied to listen long to any thing, and I soon walked out to the stable.— I had my horse brought out and saddled and bridled in order to try him. I saw that the girths, reins, and stirrup leathers were all strong and well fastened, and having girded on my sword and put my pistols in my belt, I mounted, and following the direction given me to turn round the corner of a wall that ran near the inn, a little beyond which was the starting point, I in a few minutes came up to the hunting party, already assembled without the palace court. It consisted of the old king and his brother Anthony, attended by half a dozen of the royal household. They were just about to start, as, falling into the rear, I joined them. I scanned their horses, and thought, as I spurred and reined in my hired steed, that he would prove a match for any of them. In a few moments I heard steps behind us, and looking back saw the two Frenchmen. “We had entered a pine wood and were proceeding in silence, still keeping to the road, at a moderate trot, hearing every now and then from a valley to the left the cry of the dogs. The two Frenchmen continued their talk, and so loudly as to attract the attention of the royal party, several of whom looked round. Lest I should be taken for one of the Frenchmen, I separated myself from them as much as I could, riding up by the side of the hindmost of the king's attendants, who seemed to be half groom half gentleman. He eyed me with a suspecting air, and his look was several times, I thought, directed towards my pistols. Wishing to let him see that I had no connexion with the Frenchmen, I put on a deaf look as to their conversation and made a remark to him in German. I got only a monosyllable in return; and observing that he appeared as anxious to keep me behind him as I was to keep the Frenchmen behind me, I fell back,—thinking to myself, how I would dash ahead of him in the thick of the hunt,— when a rattling volley of French, exchanged between the two Frenchmen, drove me forward again. Presently a yell as of a hundred hounds swept up from the valley. The party quickened its speed. `Ah!' said I to the German, `the hunt, I suppose, is going to begin now.'—`Begin! its ended, I believe.'— `Ended!'—`Yes;' said he, with evident satisfaction after listening for a moment, `they 14* have caught the boar.'—`Caught the boar! who have caught the boar?' `The huntsmen.' The party suddenly turned to the left through another road in the direction whence the cries of the dogs came. We had now got into a gallop and were approaching the dogs whose cries however had become faint. Suddenly we halted. One of the party rode forward, and soon returned.— Upon this the king dismounted under the shade of some tall trees. We all followed his example. One of the Frenchmen was describing to the other a boar hunt he had witnessed in France, and in so loud a tone that even the old king looked round. I drew off from them, fearing that I should be implicated in their discourtesy. I kept my eyes fixed in the direction of the dogs. Presently I described the boar—bleeding and exhausted, dragged along on his back by four men, one having hold of each of his legs.— They dragged him before the king. One of the attendants presented to his majesty a drawn hunting-sword. The king took it, walked up to the prostrate boar, and pierced his heart. He drew out the sword and gave it back to the attendant. He then remounted his horse, and the rest of the party did so after him, and we trotted back by the same road to Mortizburg. The wood through which we passed was intersected in every direction by smooth roads. The wall I had gone round on starting from the inn was part of an inclosure in which wild boars, taken in the forest when young, are confined. When the king wishes to have a boar hunt, a full grown animal is caught in the pen; his tusks are sawed off; and he is then let loose.” “Well,” said Mr. Barclay, seeing that Alfred had finished, “there was good sport, although not of the kind you expected.” “You should head this,” said Alfred,--“A royal boar hunt in Germany, in which the hunter was hunted by two Frenchmen.” “These two young men,” said Mr. Keppel, “as they appeared on that morning, were, with the exception of their want of courtesy, a realization of the vulgar English and American notion of a Frenchman; and had I not lived some time among the French people and known personally many individuals of it, I should have exclaimed—What complete Frenchmen! whereas they only presented a caricature of traits superficially distinctive of their nation—talkativeness, and fondness for display.” “And perhaps,” said Mr. Barclay, “had you become acquainted with them, you would have found that their conduct on that occasion, though unwittingly on their part, was a caricature even of themselves.” “About the same time,” said Mr. Keppel, “I met with another and more complete caricature—an Englishman, whom you might have supposed to be travelling for a wager or as a penance. He admired nothing, and despised the people: he was always uncomfortable and always grumbling. He avoided contact with the natives and associated only with Englishmen. He seemed to feel as if he had been taken in, when sometime after we had been acquainted, he discovered that I was not an Englishman. His countrymen called him, by way of distinction, John Bull.” “The hunt itself was another caricature,” said Alfred. “Not exactly a caricature,” said Mr. Keppel; “rather a degeneration. The old king, no longer capable of performing the reality, went through the form merely of a hunt.” “This condition of the royal amusement in Saxony,” said Mr. Barclay, “may be taken as a type of that of the serious vocation of kings in most countries of Europe, where the ceremony and outward circumstance of monarchy are continued, while much of its power has passed, and is further passing away; where, indeed, although there is a nominal monarch, there is, in strictness, no monarchy.” “I hav'nt yet done with the traveller's journal,” said Alfred. “Listen to some verse.” And, re-opening the paper, he resumed reading, pausing at the end of each piece, to make comments, or to listen to those of Mr. Keppel. “THE ALPS AT SUNSET. “Wherefore and what are ye?—unlike all else Of earth: changeless where every thing is change: Motionless 'midst the ceaseless flow of life!

Although the editor would regret such an opinion, as an error calculated to weaken the impression of the contents of the volume, he should not have alluded to it,—trusting to the discernment of the majority of readers,—but for the introduction of these translations from Faust, between the latter of which and the prose version of the same passage by Mr. Hayward there is so strong a resemblance, that the reader who should doubt that it had been made at the time it purports to have been made, would be excusable for doubting that the resemblance is an accidental coincidence. For the satisfaction of such, he makes known, that both of these translations were published in this country in the year 1830, and may be seen in print as a proof that the resemblance is purely accidental. Mr. Hayward, should Mr. Keppel's translation, meet his eye, would be amused by the coincidence, as the Editor of this volume was on reading his,—extracted in a beautiful article in Frazer's Magazine, to which the editor is indebted for all that he has seen of Mr. H's highly commended version. In a fine critique on Faust, is Nos. 1 and 2 of the Knicker-bocker, there are translations, whose excellence, combining fidelity with poetic lightness and spirit, prove the writer competent to give a poetic version of the whole of the great original. Although it be, in strictness, true, as the writer states, that a perfect translation of a great Poem is an impossibility; the specimens he has given are evidence that, would he perform this task, his production would be an acquisition to the English language, and an honor to American literature. FROM GOETHE'S FAUST. PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN. HYMN OF ANGELS. Raphael. “The sun still sings, forever singing, In brother spheres his rival song, And now his path prescribed is bringing To end, as thunder rolls along. His aspect Angels aye rejoices, Though none his law can see or say. The unrevealed works and voices Are grand as on creation's day. Gabriel. “And swift and light the earth is streaming With gorgeous change so black and bright; In hues of Paradise now beaming— And now wrapt deep in gloom of night. The sea 'gainst rushing rivers striving, On rocklands bursts its foam and wrath; And rock and sea are onward driving Eternally in Heaven's path. Michael. “And storms in contest wild are pouring From land to sea, from sea to land, 15 And form while raging fierce and roaring Of deepest action one close band: There lightning's vivid flash is glaring Before the coming thunder hoarse: But these, Oh! Lord, thy orders bearing, Revere the universe's course. All three. “The sight to Angels, vigor gives, Though none thy law can see or say; And thy bright world forever lives, As bright as on creation's day. “FROM THE GARDEN SCENE. Faust. “Who dare him name? And who, proclaim, I believe in him: Who that may, Feeling say, I believe in him not. The all-infolder, The all-upholder, Holds and upholds he not Thee, me, himself? Arches not Heaven there above? Lies not the earth firm here below? And mount not up eternal stars Friendly twinkling over us? Behold I thee not, And feel'st thou not existence Pouring through thy heart, And weaving in eternal mystery Invisibly visible around thee? Fill full thy soul with consciousness of being, And when thou art happy in the fulness, Call it then what thou wilt— Call it bliss! soul! love! God! I have no name for it! Feeling is all in all: Name is sound and smoke Curling round Heaven's fire. Margaret. “That is all right well and good; About the same as what the parson says, Only in somewhat different words. Faust. “All places say it, All hearts beneath the light of heaven, Each in its own language; Why not I in mine?”</field>

Although it be, in strictness, true, as the writer states, that a perfect translation of a great Poem is an impossibility; the specimens he has given are evidence that, would he perform this task, his production would be an acquisition to the English language, and an honor to American literature. FROM GOETHE'S FAUST. PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN. HYMN OF ANGELS. Raphael. “The sun still sings, forever singing, In brother spheres his rival song, And now his path prescribed is bringing To end, as thunder rolls along. His aspect Angels aye rejoices, Though none his law can see or say. The unrevealed works and voices Are grand as on creation's day. Gabriel. “And swift and light the earth is streaming With gorgeous change so black and bright; In hues of Paradise now beaming— And now wrapt deep in gloom of night. The sea 'gainst rushing rivers striving, On rocklands bursts its foam and wrath; And rock and sea are onward driving Eternally in Heaven's path. Michael. “And storms in contest wild are pouring From land to sea, from sea to land, 15 And form while raging fierce and roaring Of deepest action one close band: There lightning's vivid flash is glaring Before the coming thunder hoarse: But these, Oh! Lord, thy orders bearing, Revere the universe's course. All three. “The sight to Angels, vigor gives, Though none thy law can see or say; And thy bright world forever lives, As bright as on creation's day.</field>

The all-infolder, The all-upholder, Holds and upholds he not Thee, me, himself? Arches not Heaven there above? Lies not the earth firm here below? And mount not up eternal stars Friendly twinkling over us? Behold I thee not, And feel'st thou not existence Pouring through thy heart, And weaving in eternal mystery Invisibly visible around thee? Fill full thy soul with consciousness of being, And when thou art happy in the fulness, Call it then what thou wilt— Call it bliss! soul! love! God! I have no name for it! Feeling is all in all: Name is sound and smoke Curling round Heaven's fire. Margaret. “That is all right well and good; About the same as what the parson says, Only in somewhat different words. Faust. “All places say it, All hearts beneath the light of heaven, Each in its own language; Why not I in mine?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. The following day, Herbert was early in town. Alfred had asked him to call on him as soon as he should come in. Deeply interested for Herbert, he was anxious to serve him. But how could he do it? In his view, the great danger of such a position was disappointment. This was the calamity with which he saw Herbert threatened. While his own recent experience thus led him to figure this contingency as the sole evil, and to magnify the evil; from the same source he learnt, how vain is any attempt to soften it. He had himself felt, that the misery of affection warmed into passion, foiled of its object, and thrown back to wear itself out by self-consumption, is complete. That Herbert might suffer this misery, was the fear which excited so strongly his concern; and that he might escape it, was the engrossing wish of his mind. His doubts respecting Miss Walsall's worthiness were merged in sympathy for his young friend's present feelings. Even the worldliness he was disposed to impute to her, did not now present itself as an objection; so eager was he to seize on whatever appeared to give promise of success. He was revolving in his mind the difficulties and probabilities of the case;—at one moment venting aloud indignation against Langley; then, threatening Miss Walsall, should she not play Herbert fair; then, anticipating a favorable issue; then, trying to imagine consolation in case of failure,—when Herbert arrived. “Well, Herbert,” said Alfred abruptly, “I have come to the conclusion, that a woman who will permit the addresses of such a 15* scoundrel as Langley is not deserving of yours.” “You have taken one of your short cuts to a conclusion,” said Herbert. “You dont know that Langley is a scoundrel. It is certain that Miss Walsall does'nt know it, if he is. You are not even sure that he is a lover.” “I am not sure that you are. Or if you were yesterday, you may not be to-day. Have you not at times been seized with a longing for certain things or conditions,—for wealth, or power, or a particular mode of life,—awakened by seeing or reading of their effects, and been possessed for hours by the desire, and found after a night's sleep or a busy day, that it had passed by? Or, have you not felt anger roused, and, thinking to yourself—`I will not be angry'—by a single effort cast it from you? Love comes into the mind in the same way, and in the same way may go out too.” “Strange,” said Herbert, “that I should have got into the same train of thought just now as I rode in. I asked myself—am I in love? and if I am—what is it?” “It is,” said Alfred, with an energy which half imposed upon himself, “it is a dream. Depend on it, my dear fellow, it is. What is a dream?—Sleep and wake at the same time. The plans or promises of this state of partial life, are to the walking working man, what a far off cloud is to the thirsty, or a glowing star to the chilled. The waking wings of the mind flutter away from its sleeping body, and bear you up as if time were not, nor space, nor any other obstacle. This is now your condition. Part of your faculties is asleep; and that part which is not, deprived of the balance of the other, whirls you wildly you know not whither.— That there is a sleep on your mind you may know from this:—what you have heretofore thought of, you no longer think of; the common currents of your feelings are stopt; your anticipations and schemes are suspended; even the trees and fields and houses looked to you as you rode in to-day differently from what they used to look. Is it not so?” “Exactly,” said Herbert. “My dear Herbert, you are not a responsible being just now,—you hav'nt the use of your mind.” “This is a pitiable condition to be in,” said Herbert. “The sooner I get out of it the better.” “You are half out of it already, if you are conscious that you are in it. To feel that a dream is a dream, is a sign of waking.” “You help me so well to self-knowledge, perhaps you can teach me how to get knowledge of others. I should like to know what are Miss Walsall's waking dreams, or whether she has any.” “Ah!” said Alfred, “a woman's dreams are beyond our ken. The ripples on the surface of the water we can count; but, how deep sinks the pebble we have cast, or what it rests on, is hid from us: beware how you interpret the smile that breaks on the soft face of a woman to your words or looks,—it may be the same, whether these have sunk deeply or not.” “Nay, but if I mean my words and looks to speak the language of my heart, why shall I not ascribe to her the same sincerity? Are women less truthful than men?” “They are more truthful,” answered Alfred. “And often their deceit is the shadow of men's falsehood; as the fencer must follow the foil of his adversary in its feints as well as in its thrusts? A woman acts on the defensive, and is obliged to give you a certain scope, that she may see whether your attack is feigned or real. Before she can let you read her feelings, she must read yours.” “You allow then, deception on her part.” “Not deception: but, to a certain extent, passiveness to your advances; and this, for the purpose not only of discovering what your designs are, but of learning her own feelings?” “This is placing me in her power, without any pledge from her. “Nor have you a right to any.” “And if she abuse the power—” “And if you abuse your power over her? This is in her favor small advantage, to the difference of your natures and positions.— What are in such a case a man's feelings to a woman's? I know, Herbert, the hold that the heart will take, for I have felt the wrench of its sundering;—and if the strength of a man quails under it, what must it be to the weakness of a woman? The deep injury I have suffered would have been immeasurably deeper had I inflicted it,—villain would then be a mild name for me.—But, Herbert, you too may act on the defensive—against yourself. Until you see whether there is an opening in the heart of her you love—or rather, would love, for that ought to be the tense—don't give full play to your feelings.— Make sure of a channel before you let them loose entirely, else they will with flooding violence flow back upon you. Indeed, love on one side only, is a delusion—nay, an impossibility. Were we sure from the first that a woman does not and will not and cannot love us, we should not love her; and if we do love one who does not and will not love us, it is from the delusion of believing that she does or will. Well then; start from this position,—she will not love me,—and you are safe. Did you ever try to make a fire with a single stick of wood?—it can't be done; the single stick will soon go out unless a second be joined to it: this contains the whole theory of love. But I see,” observing that Herbert looked at his watch, “that you are impatient to be engaged in the practice.” “In which,” said Herbert, “I shall endeavor to be mindful of the precepts of your theory.” Twelve o'clock found Herbert at Miss Walsall's. He was not disappointed that a succession of visitors prevented him from being alone with her. He did not wish to be thrown just now entirely upon himself. Alone with her, he feared too intense a consciousness of his feelings: the object of his visit would have shone too distinctly through his manner, in spite of himself, and he would have been embarrassed. The appearance of being merely one of several ordinary comers was a mask to him to himself. He remained a long time, longer than he would have done without this countenance. He was encouraged to do so, too, by Miss Walsall's manner, which, although not pointedly affable towards himself, was, he thought, more engaging than usual; he fancied that she was pleased that he staid out several sets of visitors. The charm of her presence over him grew in strength, while nothing that she said or did clouded for a moment the sunshine of his heart.— He came away in that state of buoyant delight only felt in youth, and even then, in its perfectness, only once. He leapt on his horse to return home. He rode slowly out of town. He seemed for the first time to feel existence: the chain that had been secretly weaving in his bosom to link him to one, he felt, as it strengthened, to be a fresh bond to life. A mystery of his being, revealing to him a new blessedness and a new importance, was at the same time exhibited and solved. Smiling sweetly and deeply, love spread its bright wings to bear him into the future. He was riding slowly along in this mood, when, at about half a mile from his uncle's, his attention was attracted by an old man, issuing from a small house near the road, evidently in a state of alarm and grief. Herbert held in his horse, and as the old man, who was feeble and struggling to walk fast, approached him, he asked, what was the matter:—“Oh! my son! my son!” exclaimed the old man. “Is he ill—are you going for a doctor?” said Herbert, turning his horse.— “Yes—,”—“Go back to the house,” said Herbert: “I will go for one.” And while the old man was thanking him through his 16 tears, he galloped off towards the town. He soon returned with a physician. He had noticed this house; and, struck with the neatness about it, and the rich garden attached to it, he had, only a few days previously, as he was returning from town, stopt, and entered into conversation with a well-looking young man at work near the road. He learnt from him, that he was from Scotland, whence he had come a few years before; and that he rented this garden, and supported his family by working it himself. Herbert went in with the physician. They found the gardener tossing on a bed. His father stated, that he had had a severe attack of fever, from which he had only recovered a fortnight before; and that he would work in the sun before he had got his strength; he was in the garden that morning, when he was suddenly taken with a faintness and giddiness. While the old man was talking, the gardener's wife went to the bedside with the physician, watching silently his countenance while he questioned and felt the pulse of her husband. The gardener was in a high fever. Herbert endeavored to comfort the old man. He requested the physician to return before night; and, having promised that he would himself come back the next morning, he took his leave. The scene thus suddenly opened to him, saddened Herbert. He felt rebuked for his own happiness. He would at that moment have consented to forfeit it, to ensure the recovery of the gardener. The wife, the children, the father, filled his mind as he rode home, instead of dreams of Miss Walsall. His heart yearned for them. How fortunate that he had been passing just as the old man came out of the house. He had never before realized the weight of affliction. Chords that had been heretofore struck but by a light and transient blow, now rang within him their deep and mournful tones. His uncle and aunt shared his sympathy for the poor Scotch family.—“But he will get well, Herbert: you will perhaps find him much better to-morrow,” said Mr. Barclay. “The Doctor thought him very ill,” said Herbert. Mrs. Barclay said she would walk down after dinner to see them. Herbert called every day at the gardener's. He continued ill. The physician said his situation was critical. Neither did a day pass without his seeing Miss Walsall. These visits were the sum of his daily life: all other minutes and hours were but points of junction from one to another: recollection of the last and anticipation of the next, were the food of his mind in the intervals between them. There was no art in his wooing: it was the natural flow from his heart. He gave himself up to his feelings, thoughtless of whither they would lead: and there was as little design in what he said as in what he felt. In this way a week passed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. —“I am surprised,—I am,—I did not expect, Mr. Barclay:—you have misunderstood me:— it is impossible that any thing I have said or done could have induced you to suppose:—I am grieved,—but,—but,—I am engaged.” “Engaged!”—Herbert's voice echoed her last word. He gazed vacantly for a moment, as if seeking to comprehend its meaning.— He then rose from beside her, and walked out of the room. —The sight of the gardener's house at some distance before him made him sensible of where he was. He slackened his speed. Life seemed to have left the scene around him. The familiar smiling fields looked desolate and strange. He approached the house. Was he awake,—did his eyes see? A black 16* crape was hanging from the latch of the door. He got down from his horse. He paused. The stillness weighed upon his senses: he opened the door and went in. “He's gone! gone!” sobbed the old man, throwing himself on Herbert's bosom and weeping convulsively—“my son—my dear boy is gone!” The wife was sitting at the foot of the bed: her face was buried in it, and she held with one hand an infant in her lap. One of the children was on the floor at her feet, while the eldest, a boy of five years old, was leaning on his mother weeping with her. Herbert went up to the bed-side. For the first time he looked upon a face resting in death. He gazed fixedly at the features, as if he would read the mystery of their stillness. The grief of the wife became more audible. He turned from the bed-side, and softly opening the door, he went out. Tears flowed from his eyes; and he sat down on the steps of the house and wept. Alfred heard in the morning of Miss Walsall's engagement to Langley, and immediately set off to Mr. Barclay's. He hoped to arrive before Herbert should have started to go to town: he found that he had been gone some time. When he announced the news: “Engaged to Mr. Langley!” exclaimed Mrs. Barclay. “Is it certain, Alfred?” asked Mr. Barclay eagerly. “Certain,” answered Alfred. “It's the talk of the town. I was told of it by a friend of Langley's who had it from Langley himself.” “Poor Herbert,” said Mrs. Barclay. “Happy Herbert! Most fortunate young man! I wish him joy,” cried Mr. Barclay. Alfred and Mrs. Barclay expressed surprise at Mr. Barclay's satisfaction. “I fear it will be a severe blow to Herbert,” said Alfred. “Not even that,” said Mr. Barclay. “And what is a blow to a disease for life? The girl is unworthy of Herbert. This alone is proof enough. Her heart has preferred Langley, or she has taken him from want of heart.— Either supposition condemns her, more even than her trifling with Herbert's feelings.— That I forgive her, and Herbert will too one of these days. Indeed, as to myself, she has my best wishes for her prosperity, in return for what she has contributed to Herbert's.— The sight of her will always awaken in me a feeling of kindness: I shall say to myself; my nephew,—by one of those acts of wisdom common, but not peculiar, to youth,—put a large portion of his welfare into that woman's hands,—and she gave it back to him. As to blows, Alfred,—you call it rightly; for a blow comes from without, and strikes outwardly: it will stun him; but when he recovers, he will be as sound as ever. Fear not but that he will recover quickly. A three weeks' acquaintance only! A man who is not of the stuff to throw off an impression made in so short a time, is not of the stuff to excite strong sympathy,—nay, is unsusceptible of deep effects. Herbert's feelings have been inflamed, not thoroughly affected. As well might you expect a vine to spread its branches and bear ripe fruit in a month, as a full growth of the feelings in this short space. Far different would Herbert's situation be, had his affections intertwined themselves silently and gradually— and it is only gradually that they can be thus intertwined—round hers, warmed by the gentle interchange of familiar attentions, nourished by continual intercourse, strengthened by inward sympathy;—but then, the first tendency to love would have been checked instead of encouraged: the gradual growth of affection of one like him for one like her were impossible—” While Mr. Barclay was speaking, they heard a horse's footsteps, and looking out, saw Herbert riding rapidly up. As he came near, they were all struck with the expression of his countenance, so different from its usual brightness.—“Herbert—” began Mr. Barclay, surprised and affected by his appearance— “The poor gardener is dead,” said Herbert. “Dead!” exclaimed Mr. Barclay. Alfred and Mrs. Barclay joined in the utterance of sympathy for his family. “Uncle, will you go down with me to the house,” said Herbert. “Certainly; my dear Herbert,” answered Mr. Barclay: and in a few moments they were on the way. When they went in, the wife came up to Herbert, and took his hand: she attempted to speak, but she could not: she looked her thanks, and burst into tears.—“I will take care of your children—you shall want for nothing,” said Herbert. Mr. Barclay comforted the father. Herbert sat down on one side of the room. The eldest child went to him smiling, and climbed up playfully into his lap. Herbert sobbed aloud. The child was alarmed, and getting down, “Mother mother,” said he, “Mr. Barclay is crying:”— he looked towards the bed, and was silent, as if, for a moment, he understood the scene.— Several of the neighbors came in. Mr. Barclay led the wife and her children and the old man into another room; and having made arrangements with the neighbors for the funeral, he left the house with Herbert. —“This morning I thought myself miserable!” said Herbert. “And yet,” said Mr. Barclay, “how much more wretched than it is might be the condition of this poor woman. She is a mother:— and for her children and in them, she will yet be happy. And when the widowed woman shall be drawn from her grief by the smiles of her children, the words you just now spoke to her will shine on the mother's heart, making light what but for them would be desolate; and she will bless you, my son, with the fervent blessing of a thankful mother.” END OF THE VOLUME.</field>
