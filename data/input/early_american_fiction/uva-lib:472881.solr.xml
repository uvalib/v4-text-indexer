      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. When this work was commenced, the writer had no idea of its ever appearing before the public, as it was written merely for her own amusement, and as an antidote to anxiety and loneliness in the absence of her companion, who has been necessarily compelled to be much away on business. And, now, that (through the persuasion of friends) she has consented to its publication, she sincerely hopes it may be received with pleasure, and persued with delight and interest by every lover of good reading. The selections have been sought for with great care, and I flatter myself, with much taste, and contain matter and style calculated to suit almost every fancy. As to the originals I shall not say a word, as I 've ne'er pretended to aspire to that most dangerous and dizzy of all heights, âThe summit of the temple of fame.â</field>

      <field name="fulltext">LOVE'S MARTYR. Prize TaleâBy Delia S. Bacon. âHe knew his own betroth'd bride, She would rather die for him Than live to gain the world beside.â âLalla Rook. âThis looks not a bridal.â âL. E. L. It was almost morning; the deep blue of the midnight heaven had half faded and the stars were going out, one by one, in that pale dome, as though the glory they had all night showered upon the silent earth, had exhausted their eternal fountains of brightness. The fog lay thick and unbroken in the valley, the walls of the fort were wrapt in gloom, and the dark river to the west still rolled on the shadows of night; but away beyond the plain and its clumps of trees and scattered dwellings, along the fringe of woods that marked the horizon, the pale streaks of orange were brightening momently, and those varied sounds, that to a practised ear tell of the coming day, were rising low and sweet on the misty air. Others, and less peaceable ones, now and then mingled with these. The calls of armed sentinels echoed from mouth to mouth, along the palisades that encircled the village: there was a low hurried hum within the fort, a noise like that of clashing metals, and now and then the stern, deep voices of command, and, rising above all these, at intervals, came a swell of martial music from beyond the hill at the north. The aspect of affairs, too, within the palisades was no less striking and peculiar. Various symptoms of bustle began to appear among the darkened dwellings; not merely in the sound of here and there an opening blind, or the lagging tread of some early pedestrian, which at such an hour and place usually present the sole indications of life; but there were tokens of many watchers. Indeed it needed but a single glance along the street of the little village, to show that the mass of its inhabitants had already forsaken the world of dreams, for the acting of some stern part in the exigencies of life and its realities. Vehicles of various descriptions were moving to and fro, or stood before the doors of the dwelling houses, and those who walked hastily along the road-side were talking hurriedly, with anxious brows and half-suppressed voices; lights were seen moving by the windows, and now and then, as a candle glared for a moment through some open door, women with pale cheeks and bloodless lips looked anxiously forth; and as the day-light brightened, trunks and female forms in traveling array, darkened the 5 green courts before the dwellings. The faces of children too might be seen among them pale and unrefreshed, their various tones, some in glee and some in pevishness, formed an accompaniment that is seldom wanting in the romances of real life. âThe guard will be ready in fifteen minutes,â shouted a soldier, who was mounting the steps of a large white dwelling that stood at a short distance from the road side, half hid by the shubbery. âWhere is Mrs. Gray?â he continued, entering the open door, for his annunciation had been wholly lost in the sounds of bustle within. âAh! Miss Catharine,â (for a beautiful young lady who had peeped for a moment over the balustrade, now hastened eagerly down,) âthe artillery is at this moment crossing the river, and in fifteen minutes more we shall wait for you. Tell your mother, miss Catharine, there is no time to be lost,â and he hurried down the path as he spoke. âFifteen minutes, only fifteen minutes,â echoed with breathless rapidity through the various apartments of the mansion, and above and below the confusion and hurry seemed to have reached a new impulse. âA fine hour to be routed out of house and home,â murmured an old lady who stood in the door. âHowever it's a good cause, a righteous cause, and, doubtless, we should be willing to suffer in it meekly,â she continued, vainly endeavoring to subdue the querulousness of her tones. âWilliam Gray, where's the carriage?â âComing, grand-ma,â replied the youth, who was bustling about in the performance of those duties his father's absence had devolv'd upon him in this emergency. âHere's the carriage we must content ourselves with to-day,â he continued, as two large, light-wagons drove up the avenue. âThe green one is ours, and the red one for the servants and such light baggage as we can contrive to carry.â âO Lord! a marcy, the Britishes and the Indians are all down upon us, and here's my trunk and umberell, and nobody to help me with them an inch,â soliloquised a plaintive voice within, âand to think of leaving my straw bonnet to these murderous savages, O Lord! a marcy, we shall be murdered every soul of us.â âHere, Andrew, the box behind,â shouted the voice of William Gray, âand those packages in the green wagonâthat's right. The basket under the middle seat. Ay, grand-ma, one moment and we are ready. Hark! was not that the signal?â and he darted up the steps and stood at the foot of the staircase. âCome Ma, Catharine, come Helen, the wagons are waiting and in five minutes more we must be on the square;â and the sound of hurrying feet echoed above, and soon the various members of the family stepped eagerly into the wagon. âAre you all here, my loved ones?â said the younger Mrs. Gray, as she lingered a moment at the door of her dwelling, while a shade of deep maternal solicitude mingled. with the expression of sorrow on her fine features âHere's the little Henry, Catharine, you are there, and Marion, and Anna, but where is Helen?â âAh where is she?â replied the young lady quickly. âI think I've scarce met with her this morning.â âI heard her walking in her room,â said the servant girl, who was at that moment advancing to the wagon. âAh, and there she is,â she continued, glancing for a moment towards one of the upper windows that was close shaded with luxuriant foliage. âShall I call her, Mrs. Gray?â âAy, and that speedily too,â replied the mother, as she hastened towards the wagon to complete the arrangement of her family. This was already done, and she herself was just re-entering her dwelling, alike in search of the messenger and her daughter, when the former suddenly made her appearance alone. âAnd where's Helen then?â exclaimed several voices from the wagon in tones of surprise and concern. âMrs. Gray,â replied Hannah, vainly endeavoring to conceal the emotion with which she spoke, âwill you please to go up and see her yourself, miss Helen is in a very strange way I'm certain.â Without waiting to ascertain the import of those mysterious words, Mrs. Gray now moved rapidly through the lonely and silent rooms of her beautiful home, so lately echoing with the sound of happy voices. A faint light was straying through the crevices of the shutters, revealing, as in mockery, the tasteful elegance soon to be the prey of a desolating enemy, and calling out as it were from their burial places, the strong and beautiful pictures of memory that costlier wealth of feeling, which only long years, with all their vicissitudes of sorrow and gladness, have power to gather, even around the home of love. But the bitter thoughts of the past that had rushed to her mind, were now weighed down in the heart of the mother, as she drew near the door of her daughter's apartment, by a strong sensation of undefinable dread, a fancied presentiment of coming evil, to her who had ever been the favorite and flower of that happy household. For Helen Gray was one of those rare beings, that now and then cross the dull pathways of earth, like young wanderers from the regions of romance, invested with all those bright attributes that the common experience of life teaches us to look for only in the world of fancy. The door was ajar, as it had been left by the servant in the hurry of the occasion, and Mrs. Gray stood for a moment before it, silently surveying the interior of the room. It was partly darkened, and the sweet light and air of morning stole, with a softened effect through the half lifted curtains and the venetian blinds without, while in the window opposite the door, they were only intercepted by the curtaining leaves of the jasmine, whose faint perfume filled the apartment. The half withered flowers of yesterday drooped from the delicate vases on the shelf, and this with the careless appearance of the toilette, and the scattered volume on the table, was all that betrayed the neglect of the wonted arrangements of the morning. A fine muslin robe hung on the chair by the table, and beside it a wreath of white roses whose look of perfect freshness, betrayed their workman to be some less severe moralist than nature, and bracelets and ornaments 5 * of pearl were lying among the articles of the toilette. But the eye of the mother rested only on a single object, the fair young being who was leaning on the couch beneath the window. Considering the exigencies of that moment, the whole circumstances of her appearance were singular in the extreme. She was leaning silently, and her head drooped motionless among the foliage of the jasmine, as though all else had been utterly forgotten in some overpowering emotion. It was evident at a glance that her toilette had been suddenly abandoned, for the ribbon that bound her curls, lay among the articles on the table, and the long loose hair, with its sunny tint, fell in light waves over the folds of her dressing gown. âHelen! Helen Gray!â exclaimed the mother, who had stood for a moment silent with astonishment. âHelen Gray are you ill? For the love of Heaven, daughter, what means this?â The young lady had started from her reverie at the first sound of that familiar voice, and she now slowly, and with apparent reluctance, turned her face to her mother. It was a countenance of rare and exquisite beauty, but not of the cast to remind one of the rose, or lily, the ruby or the diamond. An intellectual charm, a kind of spiritual loveliness, lingered on that young face. The ray of lifeless stone, the unmeaning blush of flowers have no similitude to the living beauty of thought and feeling, that mantled on her lip and cheek, and kindled in the eye, with the ever-varying bloom and brightness of the spirit. It is not hard for a mother to read the language of such a face, and the moment that dark fringe was lifted Mrs. Gray knew in her inmost heart, that some mysterious influence had been at work within, that some strange, fearful change had come over the whole purpose of her daughter's soul. Still nothing of the agitation, which the circumstances of the morning seemed calculated to excite, was visible. And yet, her eyes wanted expressionâall those familiar looks, those common emotions and passions that belong to the every day scenes of life, seemed utterly quenched within them, and the poetry of feeling alone lay in their blue and star-like depths. âHelen, my daughter,â continued Mrs. Gray hastily, âyou surely heard the message that came this morning from the fort; you can't but know the appointed hour has already arrived, and we are all at this moment waiting for you. Five minutes more, and we shall be too late for the protection of the escort.â The young lady returned her mother's glance with one of unutterable sorrow, and with a quick heavy sigh, she rose from the window, and began to gather up the beautiful hair from her shoulders. âMake haste, Helen,â continued the mother, her voice faltering with uncontrollable emotion, âthere's no time to dress, only throw on your cloak and bonnet,â and as she spoke she glanced rapidly over the apartment. A sudden pang evidently crossed her mind, as her eye at length rested on the delicate and costly dress that hung by the toilette. âSurely, Helen,â she said quickly and with something of displeasure, âthese precious moments have been idly wasted. Methinks the occasion yonder robes were to have graced, was scarce like the present. Little need for bridal gear, Heaven knows, in this day's emergencies.â The young lady seemed about to reply, but a loud impatient voice at the door arrested her words. âIs it possible, Helen,â exclaimed her young brother who had just entered her apartment, and now stood gazing at her with astonishmentâânot ready yet? and standing there too at your toilette now. I tell you, sister,â he added in tones that betrayed more of anger than the sportiveness they affected, âstay but a little longer to dress those pretty curls of yours, and we'll all stand a chance to try a certain Indian style, that's much in vogue in yonder camp.â âOh, God!â exclaimed the young maiden, with a fearful shudder, dropping the hair from her hand and pressing her brow hurriedly, while her whole face grew white like death. âOh, God! that fearful dream. I charge you, William Gray, speak not of that,â and she buried her face in her hands with a convulsive shudder. Surprised and shocked at an effect so utterly unintentional, the youth approached his sister with a look of deep solicitude, casting at the same time an inquiring glance at his mother, who was leaning, pale and agitated, in one of the windows. âBut William is right, mother,â murmured the young lady, suddenly resuming her calmness, though her tones were inconceivably mournful, âmy brother speaks truly. Every moment you stay but deepens your danger, and surely,â she added in a voice so low it was scarcely heard, âone is enough for the sacrifice.â âThen why not hasten, daughter?â replied Mrs. Gray. âWhat mean you, Helen, have done with this strange mystery.â âI mean,â replied the young lady in a low voice, and speaking with a fearful emphasis, âI mean, Ma, I can't go with you.â âNot go with us, Helen!â repeated both her auditors in one breath. âNow Heaven be gracious unto you,â continued the mother, âfor surely this is utter madness.â âNo,â rejoined the brother, âshe is only jesting, Helen knows as well as myself, that the enemy will be within the walls to-morrow,â and yet as the youth met the full light of his sister's eye, he felt in his heart that they were wrong. There was neither jest nor madness in that calm and sorrowful expression. âYou said well,â resumed the young lady, âthis is indeed no time for idle mystery. Mother, one to whom my troth was given years ago, last night sent me this token. To-day I must await him here. A strange and fearful bridal! God help me!â added the young maiden solemnly. Wondering and astonished, Mrs. Gray gazed alternately on the slender ring of gold, that adorned her daughter's finger, and the white robes and ornaments that had before awakened such painful remembrances, but some new and strong associations seemed to fasten on her bewildered thoughts, and her eye darted like lightning towards the window, resting earnestly on the distant hills. âAy, ay, I see it nowâ she murmured slowly, while a shade of fearful agony darkened her features. âEverard Maitland? God forgive him,â and she threw herself on the couch and groaned aloud. âHelen,â exclaimed the brother, in a tone of earnest remonstrance, âyou cannot be capable of any thing so wrong, so madly foolish! you are only testing the strength of our love for you. But the time fails,âââHelen,â he added, sternly, as with a cheek white as the snowy wreath beside her, the young lady still leaned by the toilette, motionless and silent, âdo you count your own life and the lives of all your family as nothing utterly worthless, that you risk them so wilfully?â âI say, Helen Gray make haste, and come with us.â But the voice of the younger sister was now heard at the foot of the stair-case. âAn accident has happened among the boats, mother, and Col. Morgan has sent you word, that the guard will be detained an hour or two longer, and well for Helen; strange that she's not ready yet. âAy well for Helen,â repeated Mrs. Gray, fervently, and rising as she spoke, William Gray I must speak with your sister a few moments. But go down to the court and see that no one comes hither. Aye, well indeed, Heaven be praised, this madness will have passed away ere then. âNo mother not madnessâ interrupted the young lady, as her mother slowly approached her, âit is but the cool dictate of reason.â âAh, so it seemed, I doubt not my daughter, so it seemed to you last night, in the first glow of romantic feeling. I know that such a summer's moonlight as last evening's hath a strange power over the reason of a young mind. There are a thousand bewildering influences abroad in the still air, and what may seem like reason then, is only madness, when you look at it again in the full glare of day. âSurely, Helen, you will not stake the destiny of your whole being on the hasty purpose of such an hour. Sit down with me here, my daughter, in this pleasant window, we'll talk it all over, coolly and dispassionately, and I know you'll take back those wild words of yours.â âNoânoâ replied the young lady, as she reluctantly obeyed her mother,â do not tempt me, my purpose hath been tried already. There have been hours of agony, the long, lonely hours of this fearful night, have all past since it was made, and still 'tis unshaken. No mother, I can't recall it. I can't, I must not go with you.â A slight quivering of the lip, and the rapid flush on the mother's face, betrayed for a moment, the strong effort with which she had maintained her voice and language: but 'twas only for a moment, she spoke again with the same unnatural composure. âAye that is it, my daughter. Weariness and watching have fevered your brain, and you can't think and reason as you were wont to do. But bethink yourself Helen Gray. How doth this resolution of yours become the delicacy of your years and sex? One hour, and this village will be deserted by all who can yield you protection. A few more and it will become the home of yonder enemy.â Think of it Helen. A young and delicate female withdrawing herself from the protection of friends and countrymen, and waiting alone in a surrendered citadel, for the approach of her lover! On my word, daughter it hath a strange sound even in my ear; how think you a cold, impartial world will read it? Surely Helen Gray is not the proud, high-minded maiden I had deemed her, if the dignity and honor of her fair name, are held thus lightly? Mrs Gray paused and gazed upon her daughter earnestly. She had covered her face with her hands, but the painful glow was but half hidden, and the burning tears were stealing over her fingers. âAye, daughter, you had not thought of this, but, 'tis not even now too late. No one knows of this wild scheme but your brother and myself. No one else ever shall know it. Come Helen, 'tis not even now too late.â âIv'e thought of it all, dear mother, replied the young lady, still covering her face, âI know it allâ allânevertheless it must be.â The mother relinquished the grasp, with which in the earnestness of her entreaty she had unconciously sought to urge her purpose. She seated herself again beside her: âHelen Gray, have you forgotten, that in the pay of yonder army are hundreds of that race, whose very name from your childhood upwards, hath always had such strange power over you? Have you forgotten all at once that deep unnatural horror of them, which hath always formed, as it were, a part of your being? When all was peace and safety, have I not seen your cheek grow white, at the mere mention of those, whose vengeance you are now ready to incur so madly. It was but last week we sat in this window, and talked of it, and you told me then, how the dark face of the Indian with his glittering knife, had looked in upon you in all your dreams, haunting your childish sports, and even throwing a cloud around the visions of love and hope, that once brightened your youth. You remember I child you then for such foolish fancies, but I was wrong,â they were warnings Heaven sent to save you from this doom. Did you not speak too but now of some strange dream? Ah! continued Mrs Gray, suddenly withdrawing her gaze, methinks I too have a dim remembrance of something like this, and she looked thoughtfully downward, as if seeking to recall some forgotten impression. Strange it hath passed so soon from my memory, when the horror it left, has all the morning sat so heavily upon me.â âWhat can you mean, dear mother.â âNothing, my child; it matters not, it was only a dream, a horrid vision of blood that haunted me last night, in my broken and feverish slumbers. No, not of blood, I remember now, I saw a long dark arm wound with clusters of golden tresses, but though the very edge of a glittering steel was ever waving over the white brow. I remember there was no blood. I knew not who was the victim, for always as I strove to see, the vision faded. But once it seemed the form of the young English girl that was wedded here last winter, in her gay bridal dress, and once, yes I remember 6 now, she turned her eye upon me. Ha! I had forgotten that glance of agony. Surely Helen Gray, that look was yours.â At the first mention of the dream the young lady had raised her brow, gazing earnestly on her mother's eye, while the rich glow, tint by tint, melted slowly on lip and cheek, and even the fair coloring of life, on the white brow, at last went out in that deathlike paleness. As the last words were uttered, a slight convulsive shudder betrayed her emotion; still she spoke not, and the breath came slow and heavily through her white lips. âHelen,â continued Mrs. Gray, âdo not look at me thus. It was only a dream, you know, a fearful one indeed, but thank Heaven, even for all the agony of that dream, if it will but win you from your purpose.â âSaw you nothing else in your dream dear mother,â said the young lady, gazing earnestly upon her, and apparently unconscious of her last remark. âDo you not remember where you were? Say mother, tell me truly, was it not among a clump of bright green trees, by a rushing fountain, and was it not noonday in your dream?âa hot bright sultry noon with a few clouds on the western sky, and the leaves all drooping heavily and motionless, and nothing astir but the singing locust?â âWhat can you mean Helen,â interrupted Mrs. Gray, surprised and alarmed at these singular inquiries, and the unnatural air with which they were uttered. âWhy should I remember any thing like this, I've told you my dream already, Helen, and foolishly. After all 'tis but natural. You know the rumours from the enemy that came ere we slept, and my mind could not but be filled with visions of terror. At all events Helen, you have but to listen to its warning. You will not now surely render its fulfilment so fearfully probable, as to remain in the way of these savages.â The unconscious and bewildered look with which the young lady had listened to her mother's remarks now suddenly vanished, and the settled and lofty purpose that had before calmed the features, seemed again to resume its influence. But still she pressed her brow as she spoke, and though her words were calm and cold they brought no tint of life to her lip. âMy mother does not indeed know the heart of Helen Gray, if she thinks with fears like these, to win her from a purpose, when her first argument hath failed. Say no more, dear mother, it is vain, I've counted it all already. The disgrace, the fear, the agony, I know this choice of mine is a costly thing, nevertheless 'tis worth the sacrificeâallâaye and more,â and her eye brightened, and the blood mantled proudly back to her lip and cheek.ââ âMother I'll stay here and meet my destiny, be it what it may, 'tis ordained of Heaven, and I'm not afraid.â I've done, Helen,â rejoined the mother, in a low and heart-broken voice. âI had thought, but I was wrongâyou've counted it all already, and my words were idly spoken. I had thought of your Father, Helen, of a Father's claims on the heart of his eldest and best beloved; something too I would have said of my own deep anguishâbut such arguments were poor and little worth, to one who has counted as nothing the love of her kindred. For Helen Gray, if you do indeed follow your lover to yonder camp, our destinies are henceforth parted and forever, our interests, our hopes, are henceforth severed wide as earth and Heaven. But oh! Helen this must not be,â exclaimed Mrs. Gray suddenly abandoning the restraint she had hitherto maintained over her feelings, while her voice broke forth into the rich and plaintive tones of passionate grief and tenderness. âIt cannot be that you have thought of all the misery you would bring on those who love you. You could not thus coldy reckon the worth of a mother's sorrow? You thought indeed of the tumult of this bitter moment, but did you count the hours of yearning and hopeless anguish, the sleepless pillow, the long weary nights of tears, did you think of your sister, Helen, of her lonely and sorrowful youth.â Oh no, Helen Gray this must not not be,â and with a wild burst of grief she folded the beautiful and doomed one to her heart, âI charge you my daughter as you would yourself hope for pity in your need, hear me now, give up this mad purpose.â âAnd is it come to this?â she continued, as the low stifled sobs from her daughter's heart, told how well those words had touched its inmost springs of feeling, âhath it come to this, that daughter of mine, should forsake all who love her, and her country too in the hour of its extremity, to go over to the side of wrong and oppression, and all for the love of one who hath proved himself but a tyrant's tool, a traitor to the cause of truth and liberty.â A wrong string had that mother touched. Helen Gray lifted her brow, and the dew that had trembled on her drooping lashes, melted away, in the sudden light that sparkled in the blue fountains beneath.â âNow you wrong him, motherâyou wrong him fearfully. A Traitor, a tyrant's tool; thank you, aye thank you, for those cruel words. Now I can nerve my heart again. Have you forgotten, mother, a year to day, I was to have been the bride of Everard Maitland, and was it not with your own approval?âwas it without my Father's sanction.â âBut ere that period arrived, you know, Helen, the circumstances that compelled us to withdraw that sanction and approval.â âI know, indeed, dear mother, that Everard Maitland would notâdared not, even for me, violate his sacred oath of allegiance to his king and country. I know too, that even for me, his high heart could not tamely brook my father's angry and bitter words when he refused to do it. And yet, need I tell you, mother, for all this he is nevertheless dear to meâme his own betrothed bride. I know, dear mother, you have never known my heartâno one hath ever known it, not even Everard, to this hour, my name is to him only a memorial of woman's faithlessness. It hath always seemed to me that love was a thing too holy to dwell idly on 6 * the lips, but restraint is over now. In a few moments we partâsomething tells me it is forever. Mother, I will speak freely.â âOh, do not say thus, Helen,â interrupted Mrs. Gray, âEverard Maitland will notâcannot claim the fulfillment of promises, made in circumstances so utterly unlike the present.â âUnlike indeed! A strange argument that for a loving heart. But hear me, mother; when the English stranger first came hither, and reared his beautiful home in these wilds, you know full well, in spite of his high bred and courtly mein, he was the favourite of all. Wherever he moved with his free, light step and sunny smile, there was loving and admiring eyes upon him, and even in yonder crowded city, his presence was a spell to gather around him the love and favour of many hearts. Then, mother, I admired him, as you and all did, as I would a star in yonder sky, and had the light of his name set then, I would have mourned for it only as for any thing else bright and lovely, that had perished from my sight. But even then it was pleasant to me to gaze on his bold and beautiful brow, and meet the changeful thoughts that were brightening in his eye, and I remember once, when he spoke tenderly of the young sisters he had left in England, I felt a strange fervent wish that I had been but one of them. But, mother, when Everard chose me, unworthy as I wasâme of all the admiring ones that thronged his path, to share henceforth his bright existence, to be the beloved of all, the flower of his hearth and homeâthen, mother, I loved him. Ay him, not his goodly fortunes, his fair home, or the honor that clung to his name; but him, Everard Maitland, the bright living spirit that looked out upon me in the clear eye, and spoke to me in the low music of his words. I loved him. Need I say more, dear mother? Need I say that I love Everard Maitland still, though his beautiful home is desolate, and his fair domains are passed into other hands; though those who loved him once are now ready to shed his life's blood, and words of infamy are staining the honour of his high name, still the being I loved before is the same to me as then, and though his destiny is changed, and his path is now amid scenes of tumult and blood, still mother, to share that destinyâto be the flower on that path, seems to me as precious a lot as ever; ah! and a thousand times more precious than when all else was bright around him.â âBut believe me, my daughter, did Everard truly love you, or were his affection for you any but a selfish principle, he would not ask or wish you to make him happy, at the sacrifice of all else that is dear to you!â âThere, dear mother, again you wrong him, he hath not asked it. When Everard and I last parted, 'twas in bitterness. I do not mean the day my father forbade him the dwelling. I've met him once since then, though I did not tell you of the interview, because his name was a painful word between us. I met him with Catharine by the hemlock spring, and then he besought me to go home with him to England, and told me how happy he could make me there, with his gentle mother and his fair young sisters. I spoke of you, and of my father's angerâHeaven knows unkindness was farthest from me; but his high spirit had been deeply wounded, and his feelings had grown strangely sensitive. He construed my looks and language into coldness at his altered fortunesâOh! how wrongfullyâand his proud spirit grew stern, and with cold and haughty words we parted. I've never seen him since that hour. You know we heard he hurried to Quebec, and then that he had joined the army that was mustering its forces there, but from that hour no word hath passed between us till last evening. Last evening, a stranger, a soldier I doubt not from the camp above, brought me a message from him. It was only a ring that I had given him for this, and a few hasty words written within the envelope.â âAnd what were they Helen?â said the mother calmly, for the young lady had paused a moment, as if waiting for the inquiry. âThe purport of them wasâthat as I had doubtless bestowed elsewhere, the affections I had withdrawn from him, it were better that the token should go with them also; but he prayed that I would still deign to wear the other, as the memorial of a heart that was irrevocably given; and even he added, could it be withdrawn thus lightly, it were but an idle appendage to one who could bestow nothing with it but blighted fortunes. His home, too, was henceforth in the field and camp, and woman's love he knew full well, was a thing too delicate for such a soil. I sent him back the ring, dear mother, and with it the assurance, that affections strong enough to endure cold and wrongful words, could flourish amidst strife and danger as well as by a fireside home, and love that had lived through slight and scorn was none too delicate for blighted fortunes. And it would be because he himself had grown weary of his promises, if Helen Gray was not his bride to-morrow. And I promised, mother, at all hazards, I promised to await him here this day. So the blame is all mine, the sacrifice is voluntary, and I am not alone in it, dear mother. You know that even in that very camp, are females high-born and beautiful, who have forsaken all and come over the blue waters to a land of strangers and enemies, to share the toils and dangers of the camp with those they love. And were I less devoted, I were unworthy of such a one as Everard Maitland.â But a loud quick voice was now heard without, and the next moment Catharine Gray rushed eagerly in. âNow, mother, do you know that the army are already beyond the river, and every wagon is at this moment in the square but ours? Helen Gray,â she continued, retreating with amazement as her eye just then fell upon her sister's dishabille, âare you bent upon our ruin and your own? Are you utterly distracted sister?â âNo, Catharine,â replied Mrs. Gray, suddenly rising and drawing the arm of her younger daughter in hers, ânot distracted, Catharine, but better, far better that she were, than thus to sin against the reason that God hath given her. To him, and to her own soul, must Helen Gray answer for the hearts that she hath this day made broken and desolate.â âWhat is it, what can it mean?â exclaimed Catharine in astonishment, and vainly seeking to read the expression of her mother's eye, as it still rested on her sister. âAy, Catharine, continued Mrs. Gray,â here's heavy news for your young heart. Your sister there in yonder recess, your eldest, your kind and loving sister, hath given you and me, and all of us up forever. Heavy news for you, and heavier still for your father. Children, âshe continued, glancing at the little faces that were peeping in at the door, drawn thither by the loud exclamations of Catharine,â your sister Helen is going away from us, and you'll never see her again. Helen, âsaid Mrs. Gray, who had just returned, and she spoke with an air so calm, it seemed almost coldness at that fearful moment, I've persuaded Hannah to remain here, and accompany you to the camp; I need not ask you to make her safety dear to you as your own. And now, Helen, farewell! she continued, turning to the door, and her eye carefully avoiding her daughter's farewell, Helen Gray.â If you live but a little longer in this unloving world, there will come an hour, when you will mourn for the deep love you have this day flung from you. Farewell, Helen! But then she paused, and the rushing tears dimed her sight. The parting words that tremble on the lip are but a cold unmeaning ceremony to the eye's farewell, that one last look hurrying forth from the heart's deep places, a thousand images of love and sorrow; and the mother's glance, in spite of her resolution, had wandered once more to the recess. The full light of those sad eyes was again on hers, that same sweet look of touching sorrow, that lay in her memory, gleaming through the mists of forgotten years, as it had beamed from those blue eyes, in the winning beauty of infancyâthe same deep shade that had a thousand times clouded in their depths the laughing glory of childhood. And the next moment Helen was lying within her arms. And will you leave me thus, mother? If I have indeed wronged you is there not sorrow enough already for me? You have said it yourself our paths of existence part here, and I know, dear mother, I know full well they meet no more, unless it be before the bright throne in heaven. Mother, your love has been all unto me, will you leave me coldly when 'tis forever? And Helen clung to her and wept aloud. âGod be with you,â murmured the mother, âGod be with you, Helen, and make your days on earth bright and joyful, as mine are henceforth desolate.â No, no, interrupted the daughter, âpray not for thatâthe sorrow is all mine, let the gladness be yours. God be with you, Helen Gray, repeated the mother, in calm and solemn tones, God be with you, my own sweet Helen, my beautiful, my cherished one, when mother and kindred have all forsaken you, and bless you and keep you safe for me, and bring you home to me at last in heaven. Fear nothing, my own precious child, if we must part, I say fear nothing. When you lay here, Helen, a babe in my arms, I told you of one whose love was better than a mother'sânow trust him. Once more, Helen, God be with you. There were breaking heart-strings, as that clinging grasp was undone; but the love of a young heart is a thing of strange power, hidden and strange and mysterious power, that none dream of until the hour of trial, and Helen Gray rose up even amid the low words of that mother's blessing, and stood again unwavering in the strength of her affection. And now that last lingering look had vanished; she threw herself again upon the couch, and buried her face among the jasmine leaves.â But a low dewy voice rung in her earâone more bitter farewell. The sweet light-hearted being who had been the play-fellow of her childhood, was standing beside her, and near her, her young brother, the tears fast gathering in his proud eye in spite of all his gaiety. âHave you no word for me, Helen, murmured that plaintive voice. Many a bright hour have we had together. One more kiss, sweet sister, ere we part forever.â There were hurried embraces, a few low heart-breaking words, and once again she was leaning alone by the window. The sound of retiring steps soon echoed from the staircase, at last dying in the hall below, then came the noise of the distant door, closing heavily. A moment more, and the rumbling of wheels rose beneath the window, even this at last grew faint in the distance, and all within and without was utter and breathless stillness. And Helen Gray bowed her head, and wept long and bitterly. Her soul went down into the sweet hours of memoryâthe bright laughing days of other years came back againâshe was in the still and beautiful woodsâas of oldâby the rushing streams, and the laughing voices of her childhood rung around her, or she climbed once more into her father's arms, and listened to the tales of heroic and saintly deeds, or her voice mingled with her playmate sisters in the evening prayer, as they lay on one pillow in the soft moonlight. The sun rose high and clear thro' the parted shutters, the dew-drops sparkled and melted away, one by one, on the curtaining leaves, and still she leaned weeping on the window. It was all overâthe fearful task was done. The smiles that had brightened on her in her cradle, the voices that had restrained the waywardness of her childhood, were now unto her as perished things,â the love that had never failed, had indeed been flung from her. And now were the sweet enjoyments of her home; unto her as sealed treasures. The joyous rambles among the hills, the still and holy sabbaths, the bright gatherings around the evening hearthâit was a tale all told, a dream that had passed, and left nothing but its memory. And for whom was all 7 this? Was he not a mere stranger in comparison with those who for his sake were now lost unto her? One who had scorned the strength of woman's love, one who had charged her with change and faithlessness, and more than this, one who had joined himself to an army, he was destined to lay waste, and desolate all else she loved. And yet that same being, was he not to her the one being, for whom, home, and friends, and country, were but too poor a sacrificeâto gladden whom, sorrow, and fear, and death itself, were but a welcome destiny. And this is love. âAye, Everard Maitland shall learn this day, there is power in the depths of a loving heart, he never dreamed of,â and Helen rose up at last from that long dream of feeling, and stood by the toilette with a smiling lip, gathering once more the bright clusters from her forehead. âWill you have any thing,â Miss Helen, said a low and timid voice at the door, that low and timid as it was, echoed with a startling effect, in that heavy stillness. âShall I help you dress, Miss Helen,â continued the servant girl, gazing with something of awe upon the face of her young mistress, as it met her eye in the mirror.â âHa! is it you Hannah! I remember now, some one spoke of your staying. But this is kind of you. Aye, come in and help me, you little thought to have been my bridesmaid. Yes, Hannah I am a bride to day, and I must not await here unadorned. Everard Maitland, she continued in a lower voice, shall have no hint from me this day of altered fortunes, I will deck myself as gaily, and wear as light a smile, as though this long dark year, had been but last night's dream, and my wedding day had come, as it was fixed in light and joyfulness.â With sighs and half murmured exclamations, the servant obeyed her bidding, but ever and anon as a word rose to her lip, a single glance at the face of her companion, repressed it suddenly. For as one by one, the arrangements of the toilette were completed, a strange unnatural beauty seemed gathering around her, flashing out from her blue eyes, and glowing on her cheek, and brightening her lip with smiles of strange joyfulness, and when at last she stood, in all her bridal array, the white roses wreathed among her gathered curls, and the snowy drapery flowing like light around her, to the eye of her admiring attendant, she seemed some radiant creature, from the home of spirits, and she retreated from her touch, gazing at her in awe and silence. âAnd now, Hannah, I charge you watch by yonder windowâ fix your eye on the road as it winds by the hemlock wood, and if you see but a shaddow crossing it; call me, and that speedily.â She left the room as she spoke, and her light tread was soon heard along a distant passage. The sun was shining high in the Heavens, as the young bride at length opened the door of the deserted mansion, but no voice, or faintest tread, broke that perfect stillness. The dwellings that but yesterday, at this hour, were echoing with the sounds of life and toil stood with closed doors, lonely and desolate, and midnight silence hung around the busy haunts of noonday. There was a solitude about it all, chilling and fearful, and she stood in the door gazing down the street, till her eye ached for some form of life, and the slightest tone of human voice would have been like music. A deep shrill sound seemed to wind at that moment along the distant hills, but so faintly it reached the ear it might be fancy, and she leaned forward listening breathlessly. It came again, as shrill and deep and nearer than before, and still she leaned listening in doubt. So strange a sound it seemed, so utterly unlike all she had heard before! The first faint echo had indeed sounded like some strain of martial music, but as it came again, nearer and more distinct, she knew it was neither drum, or fife, or clarionâcould it be the note of human voice? and with an undefined and sickning fear, she watched for it again. But now a loud quick call from above, rung through the building. âMake haste, make haste, Miss Helen.â The door was closed swiftly and locked and barred, and she stood by her maid on the stair-case! They are on the hill, Miss Helen, you may see them now, if you will but hastenâa dozen of them âI marked them plainly,â and in a moment she was by her window, following the direction of her servant's finger, as she pointed away among the distant hills. âNo, no, not there, dear Miss Helen, below the woods, there they are by the hemlock spring. You see them now.â âWho?â inquired her companion slowly, as her eye at last fell upon a cluster of small white objects, that now seemed stationary on the hill side, just where the winding road came out from the woods above. âWho do you mean, Hannah?â âAnd is it for me to say Miss Helen, you surely see their blankets waving in the wind, as plain as I do, and you heard the war-whoop when you stood in the door below.â Sure I am you could not mistake that, for any sound in earth or Heaven.â âAy, ay, the Indians,â replied the other slowly. âBut you are not afraid of them, Miss Helen, or you would not think of living in yonder camp. They say they are plenty there.â And after all I need not to have been so frightened. I should have known they were coming to the spring for water. Ah, now they are moving!âSure as I am alive, Miss Helen, they are coming this way again! But do not look so pale; it cannot be they are coming here, for how should they know so soon that the General is gone?â With silent and fearful emotion they now watched from the window the slightest movements from the distant horsemen, until their forms were at length hid by the intervening objects; and still they gazed on the spot where they had last vanished listening breathlessly for some sound to confirm or scatter their conjectures. Minutes past, long dreadful minutes, and all was silence, and minutes more, and still no sound but the rushing river, broke the stillness. âYes I was wrongâ exclaimed Hannah, at length rising from the posture of painful attention. âWe should have heard from them long before this, if they 7 * were coming hither. They have gone home some other way, Miss Helen, and all my wonder is they have contrived to keep their horrid tongues to themselves so long in any case!â But the words died on her bloodless lips. A heavy trampling and the loud whoop within the very street of the village, gave a fearful check to her exultations. âNow God save you and me Miss Helen, for there is no help in man for us,â and she threw herself on the floor, groaning aloud in the extremity of her terror. âBe quiet, be quiet, Hannah,â repeated her companion, assuming at that fearful moment that calm decision that belongs at times to high wrought feelings, âfear nothing Hannah, when they find the fort and village deserted, they will never think of searching this dwelling. Why should they dream that it is not deserted as the restâunless it be,â she added in a tone half inaudible, âthat the doom which hangs over me, must be fulfilled.â The tramp drew nearer. âHush, hush,â whispered the young lady, as a low shriek escaped from the lips of her companion.â âThey are passing now,â and she wiped away the cold dew that was settling fast upon her brow. But even while the words were yet on her lip the noise without had suddenly ceased, and the next moment the horrid whoop rung loud and clear beneath her very window. âIt is all over with us,â whispered Hannah, as again and again that wild yell rose and trembled through the room. âIt is all over with us both, an evil hour was that when I consented to stay with you.â âHark Hannah,â interrupted her companion, âDid you hear that?â she continued listening eagerly. âWas it not Maitland they said?â She waited and again the name of her lover rose to her ear, in the wild and strange accents of that savage tongue. âThank Heaven!â she exclaimed, hastening to the window, but the arm of her servant with-held her from her purpose. âYou must notâyou shall notâ she murmured in the desperate tones of terror. âThere has been madness enough already. Do not tempt Providence too far, Miss Helen.â âFear nothing Hannah, hide yourself, I'll meet these savages alone,â she continued with a strong effort releasing herself from her grasp, and hastening to the window. But she turned away quickly, with a low, shuddering groan, from the dark eyes that were glaring up from beneath, and it needed indeed all the magic influence of that precious name, that now once more rung on her ear to draw her again to meet them. There were many Indians waiting without the gate on horseback, but one had rode within the court, and he sat beneath the window gazing upward. He was a chiefâby the tokens on his neck and armsâand there he sat in all the wild fantastic array of savage warfare, the lines of black mingling with the blood-red paint on his features, and the long hair hanging loosely on his blanket, from the circlet of crimson feathers above. Scarce human he seemed, and well indeed might the eye of that young and beautiful creature shrink from his withering gaze, as she stood there, lone and helpless, looking fearfully down upon him. But another object now caught her eye, âsurely there's Everard's own beautiful steed,â she murmured, glancing on the noble animal that stood beside the chief, arrayed and prancing fiercely beneath his unskilful rein. âIt is, it must be so, and caparisoned for a lady tooâwhat means it?â and she now perceived, that as the Indian again repeated her lover's name, he pointed to a sealed letter in his hand, motioning her at the same time to unbar the door, and receive it from him. Was there still a chance for treachery? But love and fear are inventive passions. In a few moments she had let down her toilette box from the window, and the next, the letter was in her eager hand. A dark chesnut lock fell from its folds, as she tore it quickly open. Suspicion was now over; there needed no other token, and yet as her trembling companion watched her features, while one by one the hurried lines met her eyes, she saw with surprise the bright flush of joy all fading out, and when at length it was finished, and she quietly refolded it, it was with a look of deep and strange hopelessness. âThis is too much,â she murmured, âthis is cruel! How could you, Everard, ask it of me, when you knew how strangely I've always feared these beings?â and her eye fell again on the contents of the letter. âAy, sweet Helen,â and she read aloud, as if unconsciously. âFear nothing, my sweet Helen. If I had but dreamed yesterday of your noble, generous purpose, I would have come at my life's risk, gladly. And now this is all that I can do. But trust me, my precious one, you need not fear them, they are true and faithful to meâ trust me, they will not harm you,â and twice she repeated the last sentence, with a strange and solemn earnestness. âTrust me, ay it is well,â she added, rising quickly. âI will not shrink from it now,â and she gave an assenting token from the window. âBring me my hat and mantle, Hannah,â she continued, calmly, âI must go with these savages. There's no help for it. And why need I shrink from it? Surely I should not dread to go where Everard Maitland trusts me so fearlessly. But your life shall be safe. Your horse still waits for you. I see the news from the fort has not yet reached the enemy, you may yet rejoin those who this morning left us. You will see my mother,â Hannah, she added after a moment's pause, ardently struggling with her emotion, âyou will see them all. Oh what would I not sacrifice for one such glimpse. But that is pastâforever,â and she checked the strong passion that trembled in her tones. âHannah, speak to them of me, as of one who had not grown weary of her choice, even before the glance of an Indian's eye.â And she flung her light mantle around her as she spoke. âGod bless you, Hannah, you have been kind to me,â she continued, tearing herself from the embrace of her weeping companion. A loud signal from without announced the impatience of her savage conductors, and with one long lingering glance, Helen Gray went out from her apartment. The next minute the outer door was unbared, and Hannah beheld her as she gazed eagerly through the shutters, coming forth at last into the court beneath. She saw the gentle and calm resolution with which the high-hearted maiden bore those savage glances that in a moment flashed upon her, and beneath it all the deep suppressed emotion, that once, and only once, gleamed out as her eye fell on the long bare knife that hung by the chief, glancing in the sunbeam. It would seem as if that fiery steed had recognised the touch of that fair hand, that for a moment lay on his neck so soothingly, and as he reared his beautiful head, and quietly obeyed the gentle impulse, the young lady lifted her face once more to the window. And the faithful servant leaned her head, and wept as that sweet mournful smile, and the last glance of those sad, sad eyes faded from her sight. When again she looked forth from the window, the white plume and the bright green mantle were waving among the distant trees; but these were soon lost to her view, as with that strange and fearful retinue, Helen Gray moved on to her bridal. The burning noontide was past. Hot and sultry glowed the early afternoon among the lonely hills, and in the path that here wound along the edge of the blue river at their feet, a single horseman was winding his way swiftly onward. Beautiful to the aching eye were the bright patches of wood that now and then crowned the hills, and the cool, clear waves that murmured at their depths, but the eye of the horseman rested only on a single peak among the distant summits, and heedless of dust, and toil and the burning heat, onward he pressed, as though life and death were in his errand. The strength of the noble animal he rode was already well nigh exhausted, but though no vestige of human dwelling appeared in sight, onward and onward he urged him with a speed which seemed at every step to gather a fresh impulse. There was a cloud on the brow of the bold young rider, and something of deep passion in the restless and changeful light of his clear eye, that seemed only to find relief in the renewed speed with which he still urged on to the hill beyond. And as at last he toiled slowly up the ascent, amid the stillness of that wild and secluded spot, hitherto broken only by the slight music of insects, or the faint warble of some lonely bird, there came a low hum, a mingling as of many sounds, deepening and swelling momently. At last he stood on the brow of the cliff, looking eagerly downward. A strange sight was there. In that solitude of woods and hills, where but a moment before nature had seemed alone in her majesty, lay the flower of England's forces âa vast army strewed with its thousands the plains beneath. The wealth and genius of a mighty nation lay spread among the silent hills, profaning the sanctity of nature with the tumult of many voices, the roll of the fife and drum, and tents and waving streamers, and all of that vast array of martial pomp that became the camp of the victorious and royal army, pursuing even here in her far temples, the sons of freedom who had fled to their refuge. But the glittering uniform of the young officer who was now leading his panting steed towards the intrenchments, plainly indicated that his sympathies were one with those within, and, in a few minutes more, he was standing before the splendid tent, that betokened the general of those proud forces. âHa! Colonel Maitland,â exclaimed the officer who sat by the table within, starting suddenly from an abstraction so deep, that the intruder stood by his side ere he had lifted his eye from the papers before him. âReturned, Colonel Maitland?âwhat accident?â and something of a frown hung on his heavy brow. âMy embassy was accomplished, sir,â replied the other, laying upon the table a sealed packet as he spoke. âAccomplished!â repeated the officer, surveying him with incredulous surprise. âHow am I to understand you, Colonel Maitland? my memory deceives me strangely, or you left the camp this morning. Am I to congratulate myself that the necessity of proceeding to the fort was already obviated?â âScarce morning when I left sir,â replied the young gentleman, hurriedly, âthere were many miles between me and the camp ere sun-rise and little cause for congratulation as these dispatches will prove to you. I left the advanced party but ten miles from the fort.â âAnd the draught horses, Colonel Maitland? no further news from them?â âYes, sir, they had arrived, but only one fourth of the number contracted for.â A half muttered curse fell from the lips of the superior officer, as he broke the seals of the packet, âHa! ha!â he murmured, glancing hastily over the contents, âthis is too much!âtwelve oxen to one batteau, and but fifty teams. But ten miles, you said Colonel Maitland, and only one day's provision in advance for all this army. This will not do,â he continued, shoving the papers fiercely from him, and striking his hand upon the table, as he spoke with an emphasis that startled his musing companion. He leaned his brow heavily on his hand, apparently lost in abstracted thought, for a long, and it seemed to his impatient auditor, an irksome pause succeeded to his last observation. âGeneral Burgoyne,â said the latter, at length venturing to interrupt the tedious silence, âI'm intrusted with a message from General Reidsel to the Baroness â, if you have no farther commandsâ ââwhat said you, Colonel Maitland?â interrupted the other, suddenly lifting his abstracted glance. âThe Baroness?âay,â he added quickly, âit will do well enough in time of peace, but Colonel Maitland is aware, no doubt, there are more important subjects on the tapis just now, than a lady's behests. The eye of the young officer darted suddenly on the speaker with a glance of keen and angry suspicion, gazing sternly on his features for a moment, 8 as though he would have detected some hidden meaning in his words of irony, but the brow of the General again sunk on his hand, in the same deep reverie from which his words had aroused him. âSit down, Colonel Maitland,â said the latter, at length lifting his eye to the young gentleman, as he stood by the table in the attitude of patient attention, while his restless glance betrayed some powerful and suppressed emotion. âThe alertness you have this day displayed,â continued his commander, âand the judgment as well as gallantry you have on many occasions exhibited induce me to offer you now the charge of an expedition of high importance, one which has for some time past been maturing, today's despatches have convinced me that it can't with expediency be delayed any longer.â He paused a moment. âThere's little explanation needed. You know, as well as myself, the situation of this armyâmoving just in the rear of one whose business it is to remove from the way every supply of service or provision. We shall give these rebel forces,â he muttered with an oath, âother work ere many days, than driving cattle, and breaking down bridges, for our accommodation. Once in the rich country beyond, Colonel Maitland, and the difficulty is ended, but meanwhile we must open other sources than the scanty supplies from above, or I see nothing but defeat and ruin, in spite of discipline and numbers. An army whose expenses are draining the treasures of the nation, loitering idly among the hills! It will never do But as to this expedition, Colonel Maitland, mark me, I leave it to your option to accept or decline the appointment as you will; but until the choice is made, I must speak briefly of it. A foraging party, what say you, Colonel? a foraging party on the borders of Connecticut, to re-unite the provincial corps, to collect horses and provisions for the army, and join me again at Albany, what say you, sir?â he continued, gazing with some surprise upon the flushed brow of the young officer. âI say, sir,â replied the latter, âI can only say, General Burgyone, the honor you would confer upon me is immeasurably above my meritsâbut you have left it to my choice. At an other time the liberty were useless: now I must avail myself of it. There are circumstances, sir, which compel me wholly to decline this appointment.â âIt is well, as you please, Colonel Maitland,â replied the other, surveying him with some slight displeasure, âI had thought it a service suited to the daring of your characterâbut it matters little. There is another in the camp, who indeed, until to-day, I had purposed to lead the expedition, but I sent him but now with a small detachment to take possession of the hill to the left. There has been another skirmish among our savage adherents. They were at the watering-place on this same hill, preparing to scalp and murder each other, according to their national customs on such occasions, when a party of the enemy, stragglers from the fort I should think, drove them from the ground. At least this was Sigana's own account of the affair.â âSigana,â exclaimed the young officer. starting to his feet, and gazing upon the face of his officer, with a sudden and fearful emotion, âSigana, did you say, sir?â âAy, Sigana, I think it was one of the chiefs of the Sacos, but, Colonel, you are ill,â he added, surveying the deadly paleness that had gathered on the face of his auditor. âThis furious ride has been too much for you, and I have done wrong to detain you so long without refreshment. But one word more,â he exclaimed, as his companion moved quickly to the door of the tent, âthe post that Colonel Baum abandons is one of importance. I know of none to whom I can better intrust it than yourself. As speedily therefore as may be, you are expected to take command of that detachment.â The officer bowed in silence, and in a few minutes more, he was seen moving rapidly through a distant quarter of the camp. A heavy hand fell suddenly on his shoulder. âThe bargain, Colonel Maitland, the bargain. Three measures of brandy andâ ââHa! Sigana,â exclaimed the officer, as his eye rested on the tall Indian beside him, âwhere is she?â he inquired quickly. âDid the Baroness meet her on the hill, as she promised? Speak, Sigana.â âWho Colonel Maitland?â said the Indian, calmly, after waiting till the rapid exclaimations of his companion were exhausted, and fixing his cool dark eye upon him. There was something in that glance that sent the hand of the officer to his sword instinctively. âNo trifling, villain!â he murmured in the stern, deep voice of passion. âWith your own life you answer for hers. Ay, where is she? The lady you were to 've brought this noon, to the tent of Lady Ackland?â âI saw no lady,â replied the Indian, casting his eye suddenly downward, and then continuing in a tone of apparent grief. âMy white brother is angry with me, because his pretty woman loved her own nation better than the enemy. I saw no lady, I entered into the great house you told me, here, and above, but I saw no lady; I dreamed she went away with her father, to live in a better wigwam than this. No carpet here, no windows, no sofaâah, Colonel Maitland, the squaws never love the fight.â âHave you truly spoken, Sigana?â replied the officer sternly. âRemember no trifling with me. Was the house indeed deserted as you said?â âAnd is it for the chief of the Sacoes to speak dark and crooked words, Colonel Maitland, that is the white man's talk. The words of the Sacoes are like light. When you go to her father's new wigwam, and see your white fawn again, you will be sorry for the words you have this day spoken to your red brother.â Once during the preceeding conversation, it had flashed upon the mind of the officer, that the hurried and angry language he had made use of in the course of his interrogations had been somewhat tamely borne by the bold, high tempered chieftain, but all suspicion seemed now to have vanished in other and sterner feelings. âIt is well, Sigana,â he replied after a moment's silence, releasing his lip from 8 * its fearful compression, while his pale features grew strangely calm and haughty. âYou've done well, Siganaâbut what of the fight? Something was said to me, but now, of a skirmish you was engaged in this morning?â âWho told you that?â replied the chieftain, lowering his eye suddenly. âAnd what matters it who told me? you were wont to prate enough of such a fray yourself. But you were driven from the field; ay, that was it.â âAnd what if we were, Colonel Maitland? the white men were many and we were few, but for all this, the scalps should have been waving on my spear, but my Mingo brother was treacherousâhe lay by the cold spring in wait for me, he thought to haveâ butâ he checked himself, and the strange gleam of satisfied malice, that had darted from his eye, faded suddenly. âBut that is settled now,â he continued in a calmer tone. âThe Mingo chief thought to have found the white maiden among us, and forced her from our hand and won the prize, but,â and again that gleam of revengeful joy, darted from his eye, and again he checked it. âBut the white men came and scattered us,â he continued in an altered tone, âand I am at peace with my Mingo brother, for I've promised to share the prize with him.â âYou have grown strangely forgiving, Sigana,â returned the officer carelessly, while his heart chilled at the thought of the fearful lot that might have been thus avoided, and he wondered, that even in the distraction of that morning's desperate emergency, he could ever have thought of trusting to such a convoy, a treasure so inestimably precious. âAy, this is well indeed,â he murmured as he moved slowly away, better all this cruel mockery, this wanton trifling with the heart's holiest feelings, than that Helen Gray should have come to evil through my neglect. It is well. as it is,â and in a few minutes more Everard Maitland appeared, moving with a haughty and careless mein towards the new intrenchment of the east. Calm and brilliant glowed the afternoon along the hemlock hill, and away from the sounds of bustle and toil, in the edge of the dark green woods, two officers, from the regiment above, stood talking earnestly. Pleasantly came the hum of the bee from the bending thistle and long and loud rung the chaunt of the locust from the depths of the lone wood, and, broken by the rocks and trees, came the faint murmur of the distant fall, while the plashing sound of some nearer wave, mingled with the cool trickling among the grass at their feet. Beautiful lay the broad bright meadows beyond, and the fields of waving gold, waiting for the sickle, and still farther away in the hazy brightness, rose the walls of the fort, and the tops of the clustering houses. Thither the eye of the young officer was roaming momentarily, as with a stern, cold smile on his handsome features, he listened with something of restrained impatience to the hurried tones of his companion. âIs this all, Colonel Maitland?â inquired the latter. âCan I give you any farther information? And yet I might have spared myself the trouble,â he continued, following the direction of his eye; âyou know more of these wilds than myself. At all events you pretty dwelling among the trees seems an old acquaintance. And did I not once hear you say, you had resided in its vicinity. Ah, ha! I see it now; I scarce thought that a man in his senses, at least such a man as Colonel Maitland, could have declined an offer like this, for the privilege of loitering in the camp. Some local attachment,â he continued in a tone of merriment, âAh, ha, I've unravelled your mysteryâsome lady âlove in that same dwelling.â âLove,â repeated the other scornfully, âa pretty theme for the verse-maker, Colonel Baum, but you and I scarce have time for rhyming now; good afternoon to you, sir.â The elder officer surveyed his companion for a moment with some surprise, as he flung himself upon his horse, and then turned in pursuit of his own, which had wound his way along the edge of the woods to the fresh clover beyond. A beautiful spot was that which the hungry animal had chosen for his repast, just where the bright spring came gushing clear and transparent among the cool shadows of the clustering hemlocks. On the side of the spring, remote from the path the ground broke suddenly away to the left, in a small glen, but as the level was still preserved by the tops of the low brushwood that grew in its depths, none but a careful observer would have discovered its presence. On the edge of the cliff the officer now sprung upon his steed, but he started back with aloud exclamation of surprise. There is something fearful in the sight of a human being, where it is so little looked for, and the eye of the officer had rested suddenly on a bright silk mantle, and a meek white brow was gleaming up from beneath. A female, a stranger, young and beautiful, was lying there among the parted evergreens, asleep, with the white plume in her bonnet, soiled and broken; and the long bright curls streaming heavily on her mantle. She lay asleep, but there was a strange stillness in her slumbers. The brow was slightly lifted as in sorrow, in the deep repose of that slight figure; and over all that, pale surpassing loveliness there was a sad, calm grace, strangely unlike the beauty of life. The officer gazed for a moment in silence, but his first hurried exclamation had not been unheard; there was a tramp in the path without, and the companion from whom he had just parted, rode to the edge of the cliff, and he stood looking down for a moment, silently, on the young and beautiful sleeper. âHelen Gray,â and the lone woods rung with that deep and startling anguish. âHelen Gray, my own, my beautiful, God forgive me for the wrong I've done you,â and he had flung himself from the horse, and was kneeling beside her, loosening the bonnet from her brow. Beautifully burst the light clusters from beneath, but the brow was cold and pale as ever, and the dark lash still lay on the snowy cheek, like penciling. âMy bride, my murdered one, and all for me. Would to God I had perished yesterday.â He bore her to the spring; he unclasped the mantle; he dashed the cold water on her forehead and softly fell the shadowed light of that sweet spot on the face that had so often brightened it with smiles. âAnd is it thus we meet at last, Helen Gray, and here, here where we parted, here where we first met. An evil hour. Would to God that I had never crossed your path, to cloud and darken it forever.â Was it the shadowed sunlight; for as the cold drops sparkled on her brow, there came a faint tinge like life; ah, and then the slight breath stirred the parted lips. âHelen, Helen,â murmured the lover, in a voice that, with all its ecstacy, was low and sweet like music, âHelen Gray, my blessed one, speak to me, your own, your betrothed, though it be but one word; I have murdered you, but you can forgive even me. Oh, Say one word of love ere we part forever. âAnd his burning lips were on her brow.â 'Twould have seemed as if those impassioned words had reached the deep fountains of that sealed spirit; she moaned heavily. âThank God,â murmured Everard Maitland, âthank God, there is life,â but he drew in his breath, for something like a low murmur moved on her lips. She turned her head. âOh, I am ill and weary, my mother?â and still she murmured in tones that were sweet and plaintive beyond that, but inaudible even to the quick ear of that fervent lover; and again a few low words trembled faintly on her lip. âAgain, again that fearful dream! Oh do not stop by the fountain. On, on, we are almost thereâwas that not a white tent I saw? Do not frown Everard: I am coming, I am coming,â and once more her tones sunk into a grieved and plaintive murmur. âLook at me, Helen; open your eyes my beautiful one.â One more look ere we part forever.â Slowly and heavily rose the drooping lids at that bidding, but oh, how dimed were the bright eyes beneath, that now roamed bewildered around her. At last that wandering glance rested on his; and then the brightness came back to their shining depths; and then a smile, her own sweet joyous smile, gathered on her lips. She knew him then, and Everard Maitland smiled on her, though his heart was breaking. Again she gazed slowly around, and the truth seemed to flash all at once upon her darkened thought. She raised her pale hand to her brow. âSafe, safe, she murmured, âthe bitterness is over;â and then the smile grew almost gay and passing beautiful. âHelen, Helen Gray,â murmured the lover in a burst of deep and uncontrollable passion. Again, those sweet eyes were on his with an appeal of strong tenderness.â âAh, Everard, I didâI lov'd you. Say, did I not? And now I am yours and forever,â and her head drooped on his shoulder, and with a moan low and sweet as of a grieved babe, the gentle and loving spirit went home to Heaven. Death is a fearful thing, come how it will. To think of the living spirit that a moment before was one with us in thought and feeling, gone forth forever from the home that hath hitherto furnished it with all its avenues of being, wandering away alone to some far country, beyond the light of the sun and the moon, where there is no night or day, or summer's heat or cold of winter; where the sight and the sound, and all knowledge rush on the soul, when the eye and the ear that served it once are returning to dust in the forgotten earth. It is a fearful thing to think of the loved spirits that have vanished from our path. Oh, where are they, when the eye glazes on us, and the voice and the smile that have gladened our homes, are a lost treasure on the earth. Beautiful indeed is that sweet influence that brightens that fearful mystery, peopling a world of light and holiness with the gentle and lovely, who are fading from this, and joining the lone spirit of the dying, with a love stronger than death, to Him who is the brightness of that far country. They buried the young bride at evening in all her pearls and bridal array, with the white roses still wreathing among her curlsâso Everard Maitland would have it. The crimson light of the setting sun shone gloriously through the trees, shedding a glow on the bright cheek of the dead that was almost fearful; a faint breeze stirred the fair curls on the brow like life, and deeper and deeper glowed the smile that the vanished spirit had left for its memorial. And another smile was at that burial scarce less deep and wildly beautiful, but some said that even then visions of madness were gathering in that high spirit, Everard Maitland smiled on his young bride, as he gazed on that exceeding and holy beautyâto which the beauty of life is nothing. They buried her among the thick hemlocks, on the spot where the arrow of the Indian had reached her heart, and the soldiers, and the men of rank, and all who stood at that burial, owned the power of a woman's heart. They buried her by the murmuring fountain in the green glen, where they found her, among the waving evergreens that had shielded her as she fell amid that horrid fray from the eye of her startled murderer. Many years have rolled away, but to this day that tale of woman's love is told to the traveler, who pauses at the fountain, and some have said that the gentle spirit still lingers there at evening. But no, why should she? Her loved ones are long since vanished from the earth. Why should she? She hath a brighter home. When a few months of sorrow and madness were over, the spirit of Everard Matiland left its darkened dwelling, to roam with her where there is no death to cloud the brightness of the eternal noontide, where the trees are of life, and the fountains of living water, and that long past scene of horror, with all the anguish of that fearful day, are remembered only as the dim passages of a dream. This story is characterized by eloquent dictionâ affecting incidentâdeep pathos, and powerful appeals to sympathy and feeling.</field>
